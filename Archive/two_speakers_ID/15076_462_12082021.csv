15076.0,Patient,"i'm doing Okay, how are you."
462.0,Provider,Doing pretty good.
15076.0,Patient,"hope you can see, can you see me okay i'm in a different room I hope."
462.0,Provider,yep.
15076.0,Patient,"The light is a few perfectly okay good. awesome. So um so is excellent timing today for the appointment because I went I went to yoga this morning. Then, like a complete meltdown in my head during class like. my mind, the entire it's an hour and 15 minute class my mind, the entire class was oh my God I can't believe how big i've gotten i'm so huge I can't even do all of these poses correctly poses I used to be able to do now like comics in the way and again it's a tiny class everyone's then. felt so. A frantic it was a sort of frantic feeling of like Okay, well, I can start restricting I can start you know. one half of me saying that and then the other half of me saying no you're not doing that because we're in this is, you know you're not on that path you've tried that before. And it came on the heels of yesterday, for the first time in a few weeks, I totally binge. and I think it started, because I was actually hungry. hmm I did I was experiencing actual hunger and we have this big collection of candy that we've been keeping around the House to sort of try and neutralize candy. I just started eating candy and eating candy and eating candy and the thing happened that used to happen when I would binge were like it's like something else took over, and I had. A wall."
462.0,Provider,You know where I was yeah so true binge.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah and I just kept and it turned into like tortillas you know, like things that just made no sense to be bingeing. On cereal and. And I I did I was it was one of those moments to where I was like I am in it so much that I can't no distraction was going to work at that point. I couldn't get myself to like."
462.0,Provider,So.
15076.0,Patient,"I was able to I was like okay at eight o'clock PM you're stopping at the very least, because I want to be able to sleep. Getting up until bedtime I would not really sleep for a while, so I made a decision to just. My life's been super super busy, and the House was a disaster and scott's out of town, this week, so that all is layered into it um. And I had so much I needed to do, but I was like you know what i'm going to bed i'm just going to go to bed, because I need rest I feel tired. my mind, is not in a place to get anything done and accomplished really so bad went to bed myself early and slept really well, I had a really good night's sleep, which was awesome so. then went to yoga and. It was the first time in two weeks, I think I couldn't go last week because of work, but it was for weeks. And it just like my brain was just to the point where like I was at the end when we're in Boston I was like tearing up like. You know. I always know emotional. yeah you're gonna come forward it always happens for me during shovel snow. When it's like everything's culminating. I started to feel I was like oh my God I don't know if I can come back here I don't know if I can come back because. Like I used to be able to do handstands in yoga like I was just I was waiting not way into it, but I was doing it enough so that I could do things like handstands and. We tried to do that today and I couldn't even like I lifted a leg and then my legs went down on the ground, and I made this huge thump and I was like i'm not not trying that anymore, but I just felt so self conscious, you know and so like oh my God, I used to be able to do all these things. And now I can't and I just Oh, it was terrible so I don't know i'm debating. If I want to go, I mean I don't want to stop going to yoga permanently but i'm debating if. I need to take a break or. Why."
462.0,Provider,"that's that's a really hard experience. So you know one thing that's actually good is what you described and shovel snow where you end up kind of. The feelings come up because it's actually a good thing to feel those and let yourself have that moment right but also sometimes being in a class like that, where it is very kind of thin. thin people around you and catered towards then people and maybe not modified and whatnot that can lead you in a spiral so something for you to reflect on is, do you think it's healthier for you to push yourself to go. Or to try to do at home classes there's many online platforms and stuff. That you could do it on your own at home still get the. benefits have the show boss in. and modify for yourself what, what do you think seems like a more healthy choice for you healthier."
15076.0,Patient,"I think at this point the home feels healthier I you know, last month, or the month before I was like Okay, I feel I was I don't know if it was I mean I I have. gained some weight since starting this program I don't know how much because i'm not weighing myself, but I, I think, at the beginning, I was like Okay, this is out of my comfort zone but i'm going to keep doing it, and I still feel okay about it. And now i'm at a point where I just it was like kind of excruciating the whole time so. yeah i'm. sort of like that's to me is kind of the antithesis of yoga. I know that, like one of the things I do like about yoga is that you are put in positions where you're really uncomfortable. But then you."
462.0,Provider,breathe through it.
15076.0,Patient,"You through it. But even like child's pose I have to do the wide legged child's pose now you know and and it's just physically uncomfortable I do I do do yoga at home as well. I was just continuing to go to the class because I felt like there's nothing like doing it in person with people in the room, and the teacher that I just said it's a different experience, so I think at this point it's probably healthier for me. To do it at home. And i've been really good about being consistent about physical activity without the without the intent of losing weight just because it's good for my body, and I feel better."
462.0,Provider,"Good yeah so then maybe that's an adjustment, you make is start doing classes at home, you can maybe I know a lot of studios are doing live classes now you could try. Try that or like a peloton live classes and and pre recorded on demand, and I think there's a girl yoga with Adrian on YouTube that's just completely free. Okay um so you can maybe just look into those options so you're still. Getting the benefit and maybe through that process, you work on. Just accepting where you're at and modifying poses how you need to modify and just like you said breathing through some of that discomfort but at least you're not in that space where there's been people surrounding you and your mind is just so far from where it needs to be."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah no it's great there are a lot of, and I have all the yoga you know i've got my mat and blocks and i've got everything I need at home and. I usually end up doing peloton yoga so yeah. yeah I think that's that's what i'm gonna. Do."
462.0,Provider,"So that. That can be good for now, and it can you know. It sounds like like you had that little devil and angel thing."
15076.0,Patient,Going on where.
462.0,Provider,"I need to go and restrict and then you said well no i've done that, before that doesn't get me anywhere right you're going to give this program to try and that's one thing that really stuck out to me last time was your commitment to give it a try for one year. yeah. So that's the thought you can keep coming back to a solid grounding point of Okay, and this exact moment things feel really crappy but i'm giving this a go for a year i've tried restricting before how did that go i've tried this diet before how to back on giving this one, a try now."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah I I did think of that commitment for a year, I said okay yeah we're you know don't don't pull out of it, I think what was discouraging to me, was one of the reasons I got into or started the program was because my mind had been just consumed by food and dieting and body."
462.0,Provider,And who.
15076.0,Patient,intently and since yesterday my mind and consumer.
462.0,Provider,Buying. So I brought you back there I triggered yeah yeah so I want to get.
15076.0,Patient,it's been so liberating to not be over the last few weeks. And I want to get back back to that.
462.0,Provider,"place yeah so now that you're here right, you were triggered the class really got you, you had the band, which will get back to how do you think you can do a little either reverse turn turn around. On."
15076.0,Patient,"um I realized I need to i've just sort of been running and running the last few days and. You know, are my spaces and when my space is a mess I get stressed so um I just and I also haven't been taking as much time as I need to to like. I have actually been writing I printed it out, I have been working a little bit on the eating disorder autobiography and the letter to my mom. Great, but I want to be doing that more and I think that's really so I just decided i'm actually going to back out of a board meeting i'm supposed to go to tonight and just. Cry be home. Well i'm and take some time to chill and get the House back in order and."
462.0,Provider,"yeah good for you, that right, there is a big commitment and a big boundary of yours to set right to say no, and turn something down so that you can refocus yourself."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I think that's the good word for it, I just need to refocus and re prioritize taking a little time for for myself. Because I you know. I usually do that first thing in the morning, but the last week or so I haven't been too tired to get up really early so. Make sure I do that today."
462.0,Provider,"yeah and you can just see I guess the direct correlation between having that time versus not having that time right, so you can see, you kind of fell off of some of things didn't have as much time to be working on the assignments, the coping the. Just everything that we talked about right, and so it kind of veered off course, a little bit and. It goes hand in hand."
15076.0,Patient,yeah it really does it's just such a good reminder of how important that time is how like if you if you don't take the time for yourself and everything else falls apart so.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so as far as the binge goes what led up to it, what, what do you attribute I guess to that behavior you know behaviors are usually linked to something the need to cope, the need to. numb out the need to feel something you know what. For you, was it this time."
15076.0,Patient,"I think it was. I think it was the need to. escape a little bit. And it was also sometimes in the past when i've been judged it's very much just a mental thing and not a physical thing, but for some reason yesterday and and also looking back, I was, I did not eat a big enough breakfast and I did not eat a big enough lunch. Right and so, then I ended up, I came home from an appointment and I was really hungry, so it was like two o'clock. And, of course, the first thing I wanted to go for when I was really hungry was candy so I started eating that and that's not satisfying to the stomach, but it was satisfying to my brain. And my mouth so. I just kept eating it and eating it and. And I think it was a way also to avoid having to do like I said, there was just a ton of stuff on my to do list. And I tend to when my schedule gets full I tend to like look at it. big picture and sort of my brain kind of starts spiraling and starts going away this scheduled this day in this day in this day and i'm not good at staying in them in the moment so um I think I was thinking about that kind of stuff. feeling kind of over overwhelmed. And the candy was a nice little. escape and then like I said at some point. It just became it was like I could not stop putting food in my mouth and I, and at that point i'm always sort of like I don't know how I got here, you know. yeah right yeah and once that starts. And I didn't feel like I was somehow unusually hungry yesterday, but again. You know rhonda has taught me about. Combining the food, you know doing, making sure trying to make sure you have a protein in a in a carbohydrate and. fat and I hadn't been doing that very well, and I think that's part of it, too, so my body was like not getting the neuro need yeah. So so actually that's one thing I did yesterday to I sat down and I wrote out, you know put a grocery order together wrote out like Okay, here are some breakfast you can have here some lunches you can have that have all the components to them, so that."
462.0,Provider,Great just really good idea.
15076.0,Patient,You know I think yesterday morning I grabbed pancakes from the freezer and that was my breakfast and of course that's like that's not that filling.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15076.0,Patient,So so yeah I am. That was part of it too i'm sure that I wasn't.
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so you can connect to the two parts of it right kind of the emotional and the physical so physically the meal plan wasn't really being followed your body was like hello, you know. We were doing really well with the protein and carb and all that and now what's going on, so you're very hungry that that sets you up and then the emotional aspect like you said it was a lot, it was overwhelmed and. You said you tend to kind of be like that big picture person and rather than kind of looking and breaking things down into small ironically digestible pieces. So what do you think you can do to just set yourself up moving forward, not to have those behaviors again have another binge."
15076.0,Patient,"i'm definitely focus on the food and I think what i'm going to do this time as well, I actually I did I wrote down. Actual meal idea and that's."
462.0,Provider,a really good one yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah because sometimes i'll look in the fridge and i'll say Okay, what do we have, what can I put together that's a complete and so, then I planned the grocery list based on those meals so. i'm going to make sure that i'm doing that, when I eat when i'm having the components, so that i'm feeling nourished. And I really want to spend some time today working on the. Writing actually I didn't you know what else i'd love to do today, maybe, instead of writing is i'm working on my closet I started that last year. And that felt so good, just to get like I just got the floor of the closet completely cleared off and that felt like I walk into the closet and it just feels so good so. I could start yeah so. I might make that a goal today, but the things that you recommended to me the writing and. You know, working on the closet and. Just taking time to. Do affirmations I just need to make sure that i'm doing that, but i'm keeping up with that because I find that all really helpful."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so for you you've kind of dove into a lot of it and started a lot of it but it's a matter of maybe the consistency and keeping. Keeping it going really strong because you know, this brings me back to maybe I don't know a month ago, or so where. similar thing happened, you said, and you kind of fell off of some of the. skills that we talked about and and it led to you feeling, you know more disconnected having a binge etc so. it's easy to get comfortable because that's what will happen is you'll be doing all of the things and i'll get you to a comfortable place then you're like cool well i'm here now. yeah but."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah yeah totally and that's one of my challenges in life, as I often i'm really good at starting things and not following through so. which you can see right now i'm like oh my God oh my God I can't I can't follow through with this um. So yeah and you're right and i've had this happen before when like if i'm in therapy and night, and you know doing what i'm supposed to be doing, and I feel great and then i'm like why don't need therapy anymore, and then I stopped doing the stuff and then I need therapy again so um. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"So one of your biggest goals can be finding consistency in your self care and therapy assignments. yeah and maybe that can be your goal for December from December 8 until January 8 try to find full consistency in your routine in your self care in your therapy care and your dietary care. And it'll be about maybe two and a half weeks, three weeks from now you'll start to feel really comfortable again and that's when you need to maybe check in so maybe you even put in your phone couple weeks from now hey how's the consistency going right just. To check in with yourself."
15076.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm writing that down okay so from the December 8 to January. Okay. um. yeah so. Thank you for helping me through that."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's really hard, especially with the yoga class it's just a tough place to be kind of battling your brain and being at something that should be enjoyable but really not feeling very good."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah and it's one of those two words like it's all it's on me, I mean it's not people in the class are not making comments."
462.0,Provider,hysteria. And the teachers he's wonderful and it's all me and.
15076.0,Patient,"Except except there's one person in the class who, a few years ago, when I had lost some bunch of weight, she said, oh my God you look amazing you lost a lot of weight and as soon as she said that I was like she's gonna notice if I gain. And I always hate that feeling of like people who have commented in the past i'm like oh you're. Right and you gain it back and you're like so now you notice that i've gained weight."
462.0,Provider,"But you're not gonna yeah those are the worst compliments really is, I know. weight loss or gain comments."
15076.0,Patient,"I know I know. So. um do you want me to read. Some of. What I wrote, we talked about doing that, or you want me to be finished with them before we start that."
462.0,Provider,"yeah you can maybe read where you're at we can process through where you're at and then decide, you know what needs to be done to complete it, are you talking about the letter or the ED autobiography."
15076.0,Patient,Both I did more on the er biography.
462.0,Provider,yeah we can use whichever one you want to focus on whatever you think would be more helpful it's really up to you.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah let me. i'll do. i'll do that ED autobiography. Because it did bring up a lot of things and then i'm curious. So, through the Program. Do you try and encourage people to. work through. Do you try and give them tools to work through past. Events that or is it more of just creating an awareness of past events that happened."
462.0,Provider,"It really depends on the person and how much that have stuck is currently impacting them, so if things come up and you're like wow This is like showing up in my daily life, and we can of course try to think about some skills to. work through that, if not, it can be nice to just kind of put it all together and see where it came from and see maybe like the yo yo dieting and how it's like wow it's got me nowhere. More seeing like oh wow the. Food environment in my house growing up really impacted me was really unhealthy I was trained to think one thing, and now I need to untrained myself or train myself in a new way, so it really just depends person to person."
15076.0,Patient,"Okay um yeah so just interrupt me at any point because, like I said this i'm a little long winded when I right."
462.0,Provider,"No, no problem."
15076.0,Patient,"Okay there's a definite before and after to the timeline of when I was even aware that my body should or didn't look any particular way. I don't recall being conscious of the size of my body, before I hit puberty. I experienced few really at a very young age, so young, that I have memories of being at a hospital and having a battery of tests run on me and I think this contributed to my obsession with my weight. Looking back on it it's likely when I had the test run that this planted a seed of awareness that there was a normal and not normal to how a little girl should look. It was my appearance developing breasts in the beginning of pubic hair that set off the alarm bells so I started developing breasts well under the age of 10 I was in complete denial about this, I refused to wear a bra. When my mother suggested it, I was in the fourth grade mortified that I was starting to develop, no one else in my class was anywhere near wearing a bra so I was just going to pretend, I was in the same boat. I do distinctly remember three moments during this time period that triggered the after period of being aware of my weight. washing in the fourth grade when I was still new at my elementary school and acutely conscious of the fact that I didn't really have any friends, I was walking into the cafeteria at lunchtime, and a male classmate of mine barreled up behind me. As I was threading the needle between to campus trash cans he pushed past me and bumped harshly into me, as he did so when he was in front of me he turned around plants to me said so. and proceeded with his day I still remember. The shower of shock and mortification I felt the minute the word left his mouth. Was I fat sure I had gotten thicker on the middle and even if I was vaguely aware of that fact it hadn't seem to bother me. And I certainly had no clue that it was normal for a girl entering puberty to get thicker around the middle. It was really fat it took less than five seconds for me to believe what this boy told me, I was fat now I need it for certain because JEREMY Miller, told me so and I wanted to disappear into the earth number two. In the Fifth grade when I was new to a different elementary school from fourth grade I found myself in a mandatory and highly competitive game. Class Greek dodgeball which everyone at this particular school seem to take very seriously, I was terrified it was a game that was difficult to disappear into. If a ball came your way you had to respond and quickly I loved organized sports, primarily because i'd learned, they were an efficient way. to attract negative attention from other students, something I desperately wanted to avoid as the new kid and as a kid who generally wanted to go on noticed. I was absolutely terrible at sports unsure of myself uncoordinated possessing not a shred of competitive this. I still remember the sick feeling in my stomach the trembling in my body, the intensity with which I wanted the ball to stay far away from me. The ball came at me I desperately tried to catch it but completely missed the entire class ground and grumbled at me. But I was going to make it up to them by God, I was going to run and retrieve the ball as fast as possible and get it back in the game. I turned around I tripped I fell flat on my stomach scraping up my palms and the needs of my pants in the process. If I hadn't already been mortified enough, I know when it to vanish and to sit there tears to my eyes, as I picked myself up and ran trying to pretend, as if none of what had happened it happened. The entire game was paused waiting for me and watching me to full classes of kids firing daggers I returned and threw the ball awkwardly in the pot trying to ignore the black scuffs on my knees and the pain on on my palms. The girl next to me blared looked me up and down and said to her friend next to her loud enough, so I could hear every word she so stupid and she's fat look at her look at her thighs disgusting. it's amazing how, as I recall that moment 35 years later, the pain is still exquisite I know that all adults have painful memories from childhood for me this memory is one of the most devastating. It encompasses so many of my insecurities at once, not belonging performing poorly at sports standing out and calling attention to myself, and now the new insecurity being fat. Before this moment a vague awareness had been building that compared to most of my peers, partly because I was well into puberty when most of my classmates weren't but I didn't understand that at the time. I was chubby in retrospect, calling my body chubby at that age of the stretch I was simply not skinny had thighs that touched and read that didn't get out arms it didn't cave in at the triceps. I want to hug the girl I wasn't reassure her that she was not fat she was strong she could lift heavy things and her immune system was robust. Perhaps because she had some extra meat on her bones. She was not fat she was just different. And then the third event is the summer after fifth grade we traveled to meet some family, friends who hadn't seen us in a couple years when we stepped off the plane. Our friends jaw literally dropped she exclaimed loudly unexpectedly Sarah Look how skinny you are you look amazing. I was immediately embarrassed and confused, had I really gotten skinnier more importantly, was I previously so fast that it was a thing that people look at me and pity me. A few minutes later she explained again how skinny I was circled her hands around my belt and said, look at this waste I can't believe it. Now, and I look at photos of myself from this time I realized what had happened, I simply lost the middle of pre in early puberty. And had morphed into a more hourglass figure, though, through no conscious behavior on my part, my body was just doing what it was supposed to do. But a click went off in my brain and now I had a narrative about my body, I was fat before, and that was bad thing. Now for some reason I had been gifted with fitness and this was a good thing and I had better maintain it while we stayed with these friends, we made chocolate chip cookies. That were then stored in a jar in the kitchen every time I watched by the JAR took a cookie going to eat it. unable to control myself savoring the to the sweetness of each bite and I knew then that this was shameful that I needed to hide it. Too many chocolate chip cookies would make me fat again and that must not happen, I hoped our hosts would notice would not notice how quickly the cookies were disappearing I didn't want them to think I was going to get fat again. This is the only period of my life, I can remember where I could eat whatever I wanted. Whenever I wanted, while still being classified as thin clearly before that point my eating what I wanted had made me fat by other standards. And now that I had a clear definition of what my body look like Finn, I was acutely aware, when my roughly six months of fitness began to end. Suddenly, when I eat food it showed up on my body, I had gotten my period and I wasn't going to get any taller at a whopping five foot two every pound I would gain showed up on my body. This is when the dieting and exercising officially began in the fifth or sixth grade. I became obsessed with aerobics and would spend every afternoon I percival religiously performing the Jane fonda workout in the living room before anyone got home that's all I wrote so far i'm totally dating myself with the Jane fonda."
462.0,Provider,love it.
15076.0,Patient,Thanks to watch that so many times.
462.0,Provider,So yeah well that's a really good start so you're getting back into some of those really early memories of just developing even the notion of. fat and and really the cruelty of people judging you and labeling you. So what has that been like just writing that that part right getting into those memories.
15076.0,Patient,"um. It was it was really interesting to sort of it was the first time i'd ever thought specifically about. certain events, and I was able to sort of. pull those three events out and say okay those I think these are three like really formative things that have been. sort of established to me what fat and then was. And it also started and I don't know if it's because of these events, but it started I started looking at pictures of myself a lot. and comparing myself to other kids and I even pictures from when I was like four years old, I remember looking at a picture from when I was four and I was standing. In swimsuit with all these other kids and swimsuits and my legs were just the big legs, you know, and I remember thinking oh wow I was never thin. Like and that was something that I, I just think it's so interesting that I do remember a period of my life when I had no awareness of fat or thin when I just wasn't. I wasn't aware of. How my body was categorized and then. Right, all of a sudden. It just here."
462.0,Provider,I locked by oh yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah it's so crazy and it's so crazy that. That I remember these peoples names like I was telling. Scott story about the girl, you know telling me I had baptized and Scott was like what's her name and I told him her name, and I think we found her online, you know it's it's just one of those like. This happened 35 years ago, you know."
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah no I actually chuckled when you said, the guy's name, because it just sounds like such a name of someone who would do. That and and you totally do remember you're not alone, even though it did happen 35 years ago. yeah everyone kind of remembers like oh yeah and that's when JEREMY so and so said this. To me and. yeah you remember it forever so they. Go."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah and I, and I know i'm confident this happens to all kids I mean you know it doesn't always it's not about weight always but you know."
462.0,Provider,Something yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"kids can be very mean i'm. So. yeah and I am I was also it kind of made me aware of the effect of even family, friends like how influential they were in terms of. My right of you know my my parents and i'm really grateful for this, they never ever looked at me and said Oh, you need to lose weight. Or you look like you're good or they never made comments on my weight and I really i'm really grateful for that. But it's powerful and an adult family, friends as. stuff like there you know."
462.0,Provider,"It is, and then you were able to pull out sort of one of the first foods, the chocolate chip cookies that you felt you needed to hide or couldn't eat."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah yeah That was the first specific food, I remember, where I was like I felt out of control and like I need to stop eating this because i'm going to get fat i'm not going to be skinny."
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So that's you know just bringing it back to that first memory, so you can continue on with that and we can read it, piece by piece actually it might be kind of good to digested it in smaller pieces. One one part that stuck out to me was Maybe it was during around the dodgeball which dodgeball was awful just. tell it take that one. yeah horrible. You were saying something about wanting to affirm your yourself as a little girl. That you were strong or something like that can. You pull that out."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah as an adult looking back I wish I could you know, say that to to myself, because I didn't. You know, I was aware, especially after the girl made the comment that I had guys that were bigger but. I know I wish I could go back and just reassure for that that's not a character defect and that you know it doesn't make you less than and let's look at the good things about having you know big eyes. right on."
462.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely so one thing that some people find really helpful in just kind of. reconnecting with their inner child is getting out a picture of yourself as a child. And just kind of. Spending some time looking at it and thinking you know how you would actually affirm your yourself as a little girl or. When that negative self talk comes up or that negative body image talk comes up looking at the picture of yourself as a little child and thinking, how would I say these things. To this little girl. And then, trying to kind of reframe it through that does that. mean you could try or that would be."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah have any pictures of yourself where it's kind of like.
462.0,Provider,it's like oh wow look at me as this like sweet little you know girl.
15076.0,Patient,I could yeah I can find some I think I have some scanned in my photos yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that could be another goal is to start to. Look at that that childhood photo and just like you know after you got out of that yoga class gone and looked at that picture and said. Now, how did these thoughts line up to me saying that to this person because that's really who we all are, at the at the end, we have this inner child is this need to try to kind of. fit into the world and figure out where our places and we're all constantly doing that, so you can kind of think about affirming yourself in that way."
15076.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah yeah that's a good idea. yeah to remember that you're the same person that you were.
462.0,Provider,"You were like you deserve the same thought right and that you would never. Most people at least would never say any of that stuff to a sweet little precious child, you know."
15076.0,Patient,"Right right yeah yeah it's it's always so infuriating to me that it's so much easier to remember. The bad stuff really vividly at least to me, I think I mean I think that's. Definitely true for a lot of people, but I hate that I can remember these like moment by moment as if it just happened and. Then, but the good things in there were plenty of good things are much more vague they're not, as you know. burned into my memory."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's true and maybe after this and auto biography maybe we can have you go through and start to think of times, where you felt really confident, maybe if it was even like Oh, I went to a Christmas party one year and I just I was just feeling myself like I liked my dress and uh. You know, whatever so that or you can even incorporate those into the autobiography."
15076.0,Patient,mm hmm.
462.0,Provider,as well if it comes up.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah yeah positive stuff yeah. I can go back there, hopefully. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"Well yeah That was really well done so. goal will be to continue that to continue working on the letter, for your mom. to your mom how about any other goals that you'd like to continue to work on, obviously we started with the idea of just this consistency so continuing all of the things that we've set but trying to do it very consistently for at least the next one month. i'm continuing this autobiography and the letter anything else that's come up that you wanted to establish as a goal or. talk to me about process through."
15076.0,Patient,"um no I i'm, making it a goal to. Go to the. Saturday morning."
462.0,Provider,"Yes, and that is happening this."
15076.0,Patient,Saturday yeah so i'll make that.
462.0,Provider,"And all you are supposed to do is, you said you did call and check in before one Saturday, and they told you. That you I went into the bright heart."
15076.0,Patient,Checking room. And they said that. And I said I wanted to go into the eating disorder support group and they said that I needed to get. Access from my therapist I think.
462.0,Provider,Okay i'm gonna the therapist I know who's leading it this week so i'll talk to her and then i'll email you based on what she says.
15076.0,Patient,"Oh, thank you."
462.0,Provider,"I was told that you did the right thing that you're supposed to just call the virtual clinic like you did the little waiting room and they should give it to you, but i'll let her know what they said i'll see if she has the number yet. If not i'll just i'll find a way to make sure you get in an email you."
15076.0,Patient,Okay awesome Thank you.
462.0,Provider,"yeah of course yeah I think that'll be really good I guess it's been a really good group of people lately, so you know to. therapy is a really good component, it can just help to hear other people who are going through similar things and hear their successes their challenges and just. act on that."
15076.0,Patient,"level, especially during this time of year yeah."
462.0,Provider,"yeah exactly yeah okay so that's a good goal as well to get to that group. i'm just pulling up your page, to see if there's any other notes. I don't see anything I think we just need to schedule you or did we still you."
15076.0,Patient,don't we didn't I don't think we scheduled the past this week.
462.0,Provider,"We did me go ahead and do that. So today's Wednesday, do you want to do next Wednesday."
15076.0,Patient,yeah Wednesday would be good.
462.0,Provider,"See is 8am too early, is that, before the kids are. Oh."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah if you have anything later, and that would be I could. Maybe make that work, it would be tricky."
462.0,Provider,"Let me. um maybe Thursday would be better, I have a new appointment on Thursday."
15076.0,Patient,Okay yeah let's do that.
462.0,Provider,Thursday the 16th. Thursday the 16th at noon.
15076.0,Patient,awesome.
462.0,Provider,Alright you're in for that and then. yeah we can just keep scheduling you we. can determine around the holidays. If you want to skip a week or what you're. At that point.
15076.0,Patient,The following week we'll have family. Staying over so that might be tricky one but yeah we can.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so we can touch bases on that next week, but otherwise you know you're doing really good work just noticing that consistency right, you can see kind of how things started to unravel a little bit without the focus on self care and the assignments. And just to I have to acknowledge that the yoga experience was a really hard one, but you did get through it and you were able to have some of those opposing thoughts, which is a good thing to be able to kind of challenge, some of the really harsh thoughts that came in."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah Thank you.
462.0,Provider,alright.
15076.0,Patient,Have a good week and. we'll see you next week.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, see you next Thursday take care."
15076.0,Patient,hey thanks you too.
462.0,Provider,"bye bye. Okay, can you please note the patients goals for December which the first one was. Working on consistency with her self care and assignments, the second would be to finish the ED auto biography and letter to her mother and the third one, what did we just say. There was a third one, if you could pull it out from what she said that would be great, and if you could even use direct quotes based on what she says her goals are that would be great, and if you could put in the bottom of the note. Not even in the plan, but just in the note that her goals and progress were reviewed. be good to thank you very much."
