480.0,Provider,how's everything going and she's still sleeping pretty good. Oh. Look at our she's so pretty shoes. Do you think she looks like.
9555.0,Patient,People. People say she looks like both of us like i've had people tell me she's got like my eyes and my eyes structure and then other people say that she looks like Anthony mostly his family says she looks like him.
480.0,Provider,"yeah I think she looks like you, but I also have had more exposure to you than Anthony so. Sometimes, like if you're."
9555.0,Patient,"Right, I think she looks like me and Jackson looks like me to like and I put one of their baby pictures together the other day, and I was like holy shit like they look a lot alike. yeah like they even sleep, the same it's kind of funny."
480.0,Provider,How is Jackson doing.
9555.0,Patient,he's good um I actually have court for him coming up.
480.0,Provider,that's exciting when.
9555.0,Patient,On the 30th.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, like soon."
9555.0,Patient,"I was gonna keep it out of the courts and my lawyer like I was telling you about it, like I wanted her to give me more time with him. And when school started she decide well Obviously he has school on Wednesdays, so he can't come here on Wednesdays and. So I had have him every other weekend Friday through Sunday that's all I would see him and that's not enough for me, so I asked, I asked her I said uh when you're working. She works overnight so she sleeps during the day so it's only she sees him anyway, so I said. On days that you're working would it be okay, if he comes here, I have no problem, taking him to school picking him up you know all of that we're gonna have to get used to it anyway, and she denied me of it, so my lawyer told me obviously we're going to go to the courts and go."
480.0,Provider,reason for tonight you like did she tell you why. Just didn't know.
9555.0,Patient,She just didn't know.
480.0,Provider,wow.
9555.0,Patient,I don't know why. She did um so yeah we're going to the Court.
480.0,Provider,And then i'm.
9555.0,Patient,"Hoping that obviously there's no reason i'll get to nine through the courts of it, I don't see, I have a infant baby there I can take care of or Can I take care of a nine year old boy hey. Oh yeah."
480.0,Provider,"yeah oh no, especially if she doesn't have a legitimate reason to keep. him from you like. You haven't been in trouble recently you're doing everything you need to do so, the courts generally. want their mom."
9555.0,Patient,"Right exactly and there's nothing that is going on in my life right now that she can hold against me and say no, so the only thing that she is pissed off about us because I don't let her see iris and she's not going to. She don't deserve that not until you give me back my son and then maybe."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's the part I feel like she's missing is she's thinking that holding Jackson from you is going to be leveraged for her to see irs but it's actually the opposite."
9555.0,Patient,"Exactly she should see it that way, but clearly she's not."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's really sad. So hopefully port will go smoothly, so what are you asking for split time or full custody."
9555.0,Patient,"I just want three days a week, every week, for now, like. She works right and I get him, you know and like I would want him, you know Friday when he gets out of school and i'd bring him back Monday after school or even if you go home from school Monday. At like I don't know on one week and then obviously the other week I would want like we date is because she has a weekend off, and I want to be able to let him spend time with her if they choose to. But last weekend this past weekend was my birthday and. On my birthday and she sent him to his friend's house to go to an escape room. And then the day after, on Sunday, she let him come here to see me because she was going on a bike ride, and he didn't want to go on a motorcycle ride."
480.0,Provider,So I had nothing to do with you and your birthday was just her and what's convenient for her. Right that's so frustrating.
9555.0,Patient,"yep it is it really is like. instead of letting them come here on you know my birthday, she let him go to his friend's house and it was just messed up the way she thinks I I don't know. But she had no problem texting me happy birthday and she bought me something and everything like."
480.0,Provider,That so unfortunate like I don't understand where the disconnect is for her.
9555.0,Patient,"I have no idea. I really don't. mind. My best friend she used to be my brother's ex wife, she lives she's living with her now with her two year old daughter. She talks shit about me all the time to her like it has any little thing that she can think of, to make up about me or like. Any of that, and she ashlyn which is her name and she's getting sick of it she's like, if I had some other place to go I would and like. She oversteps her boundaries, even with her like she's showed her something that she wanted to buy for her daughter, and she went out of the way and bought it for her anyway. Without even asking if it was okay bought her a Halloween costume without even asking what she wanted her to be or anything like that, like that's what she did to me with Jackson when he was little like."
480.0,Provider,History.
9555.0,Patient,She just kept pushing like further and further further like it's her kids.
480.0,Provider,"wow that's so interesting, I wonder, like so do you know much about your mom's trauma and stuff growing up."
9555.0,Patient,"Well, I know she was molested as a child. or dad was an alcoholic and her mom worked a lot she ended up splitting up because he was abusive to his her mom. She lived with her mom and then mom's a Christian woman doesn't drink doesn't small nothing. And she ended up running away going into foster care. Well, in the States custody it wasn't foster care and then eventually she got emancipated and married so that she wouldn't have to be in states custody and."
480.0,Provider,"There was a lot of for her her needs were never met you probably never learned how to ask for her needs to be met so then that's why there's so much manipulation and control and confusion, because she doesn't know how to do about go about doing that in a healthy way."
9555.0,Patient,"Right and she's still to this day manipulates her mom. Like it makes her feel like shit if she doesn't do what she wants her to do my grandmother like she was helping me for a little while after my addiction and. Eventually, I ended up moving out with Anthony and she my mom made her like talk to the Guardian litem and make up all these lies about me and just just so she wouldn't piss her off like she goes with whatever my mom wants her to do just so she can stay on her good side."
480.0,Provider,"Which is probably why your mom's how she is is because, if she never had anyone set boundaries with her and enforce boundaries, then she thinks she can get away with whatever. Which is why it's good that you're. sticking to your boundaries with her and not letting her manipulate you especially with iris."
9555.0,Patient,"No, not at all I don't it's not fair to me or jax and the way she's being so i'm not gonna let her even try that at all with iris and Anthony of course he's like fun Curry she's not seeing or like. I mean I at least let her see her like when I go pick Jackson up through the window in the car, but she doesn't like get to hold her or like anything like that, like. know."
480.0,Provider,everything's been Anthony.
9555.0,Patient,Good good apparently he's on his way home you just cut the tip of it almost cut the tips of his fingers off at work so apparently he's on his way home.
480.0,Provider,Does he have to go the hospital is bad.
9555.0,Patient,"I don't know apparently his boss wanted me to go to the hospital but he's like i'm not i'm coming home, so when he gets here will we will see."
480.0,Provider,that's awful Do you know what did it like what machine.
9555.0,Patient,He wouldn't tell me he's like i'll tell you when I get home.
480.0,Provider,Oh no.
9555.0,Patient,yeah but not.
480.0,Provider,really bad.
9555.0,Patient,"I do know that he was moaning a couple lawns today, and he also had to replace a spot in my ceiling with drywall so either could be something to do with the lawn mower or a razor blade knife or something I don't know. But gave him when he cut his finger with the chain sigh like basically had to force him to go to the hospital. Any went once ended up leaving because the doctor took too long and then he's like he obviously was complaining that it hurt and I was like well you're going to go to the I brought him back and made him stay. Like he doesn't like hospitals at all. yeah."
480.0,Provider,really bad you don't need to be in the hospital all day today.
9555.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to be I gotta jackson's coming over and a little bit, but. yeah. hmm. You got really quiet when we said that for some reason."
480.0,Provider,Is drinking Ben anthony's not Jackson.
9555.0,Patient,"I know I know. he's actually. Not drinking liquor as much because his stomach when messing up on him like he tried, the other day he drank one and then tried to drink the other one end up picking it back up and his stomach has been really messed up so he just hasn't been drinking. Good that's. I know I was like well it's sad that I had to come to that for you to stop but."
480.0,Provider,At least it's helping him moderate.
9555.0,Patient,Right yeah. He the agreement that I told him like you know take to like two days off a week from drinking and he doesn't stick to that. He forgets.
480.0,Provider,Oh sure.
9555.0,Patient,Sure yeah. that's what I said to.
480.0,Provider,God didn't but so. When how often does he get drunk drunk and.
9555.0,Patient,"He don't. know not I mean like very rarely like if his boss buys him a couple NIPs and then he buys himself a couple you know you can tell, he has a bus on but he's not like drunk stagger and mumbling everywhere, whatever he doesn't get drunk like that he just basically just for buzz. either."
480.0,Provider,"sounds good, because we know that that's just replacing one addiction, with the other right, at least if it's not leading to like significant consequences. Maybe he actually can try to moderate it himself."
9555.0,Patient,He actually told me twice the other day that he doesn't even want to drink anymore you just does it for his depression and I was like you know that alcohol is a depressant right it doesn't make it any better. it's not going to help anything he's like well I don't know what else to do to treat it like it just makes me feel better and i'm like. Maybe we should try and come up with something else.
480.0,Provider,"Is he. Like when he does therapy with bright heart, does he actually talk about stuff. No yeah."
9555.0,Patient,"He don't he acts like everything's Okay, and just like doesn't open up or anything and he's basically only on there for 1520 minutes at a time and then he's like oh yeah everything's great great."
480.0,Provider,Good life is good okay bye.
9555.0,Patient,"yeah basically, like the other day I got into a fight with my dad. He basically told me that he doesn't want to talk to me at all, and all I want is for him to have a relationship with my kids and me, mostly my kids but he told me that he doesn't want to. He didn't give me a reason."
480.0,Provider,that's so painful. I I don't understand that at all I don't understand how parents can just be like nope I don't want to.
9555.0,Patient,"he's never been here my entire life and they blame it on my mom but I. You know I kind of do too, but I also think of it as his wife's fault, too, because she's very controlling. And she doesn't like me so i'm assuming that like when he talks to me, she gets mad at him or causes a fight or something so he just doesn't do it. And I said that to him, the other day I said it's not like i'm some random woman you're talking to him, your fucking daughter like what why why can't you and he's like. My wife's not going to be blamed for my actions I don't cut it's my fault I don't call anybody and it's going to stay that way like Okay, whatever. And then he basically. told me that he's a piece of shit and that i'm. Like he's a loser, and all this shit and he sent it to my phone he's like you're a fucking loser go mow your lawns and lose my number, and I was like. Look, where he is look for his daughter is like he's a piece of shit he's supporting his family, like makes more money now than we ever did together working in like we're actually doing good like that's fucked up. But yeah."
480.0,Provider,"I don't know sad, you have to deal with that. Especially from family."
9555.0,Patient,"I agree, but it's his loss, it really is. yeah for sure."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, that was the home hard the fingers. worried."
9555.0,Patient,got band aids on them.
480.0,Provider,there's no like have some fingers on ice in a cooler somewhere because that's what I was picturing.
9555.0,Patient,Pauline tag. I don't think it's. The same. syntax. How did you do it. With the electronic head years into my fingers literally walking. Through the hallway said. What. Did you hear it.
480.0,Provider,Now and in here that.
9555.0,Patient,There is an electric hedger.
480.0,Provider,Oh ouch.
9555.0,Patient,"Like cut through his skin like ones, down to the bone. Oh gross stitching. Well he's got a band aids on right now."
480.0,Provider,"I superglued my finger one time when it should have had stitches and I went to the surgeon, and he was like that's a really good job. So superglue does work if he doesn't want to."
9555.0,Patient,"Like you can use liquid bandage but obviously that's for when it's not bleeding. Because the black will just push it off. Well you're gonna have to let me look at it, at some point, you are. But yeah I don't get why my dad's being like that either. it's just mind blowing to me made me feel pretty shitty that day. I was like cursing really bad."
480.0,Provider,"yeah well as you should that's your dad It makes no sense whatsoever as long as you know, though it's him and not about you."
9555.0,Patient,"Right. I feel like it is I just mess, I honestly think it's his wife not him like without her he's nowhere. She owns a business that he works for her house that he lives in um he's even made a comment to me before that he couldn't leave her to be with anybody else because nobody makes as much money and she does like. So, and he even goes behind her back and cheats on her with prostitutes and shit like."
480.0,Provider,Oh wow.
9555.0,Patient,"yeah so I he he stuck while he I don't know if he's stuck there or just wants to be there for the situation i'm not entirely sure, but I know that he's not going to piss her off. And if talking to me pieces are off then he's just not gonna do it."
480.0,Provider,"that's really it's sad for him to be that. Insecure I feel like it stems from insecurity right, so if he's that insecure that he can't stand up to his wife and say no, those are my grandkids I deserve to have a relationship with them. That makes me really sad for him."
9555.0,Patient,"And then she texts me and she's like Oh, I have a relationship with my kids so that's not even true that I keep them away from you and i'm like thinking you ever relationship with your kids because you give them, whatever the hell, they want and they're just like you like."
480.0,Provider,In their hurricanes like. totally different scenario.
9555.0,Patient,Exactly yeah.
480.0,Provider,that's so messed up So what did you do to like cope with all of that you just cried it out and then moved on.
9555.0,Patient,"yeah basically cried it out vented to Anthony my brother and ashland my best friend. and talking to you about it but didn't really do anything other than that i'm just kind of letting it go yeah like I said it's his loss, not mine not theirs."
480.0,Provider,"And, in the long run it's actually probably protection for your kids because if he's going to be like that, then you don't want them having a relationship with him because he's going to constantly disappointed that."
9555.0,Patient,"He already did the Jackson he, like promised him this big fishing trip and they had it all planned and everything and then then morning of he canceled."
480.0,Provider,And Jackson was a kid.
9555.0,Patient,"And he was so upset and he's been wanting to go fishing sense so Anthony you know, has taken him a couple of times, but he was expecting to go out on a boat in you know all this stuff. yeah. he's like oh will replay and it will replay in it, and nothing now he's building some house and so distracted with life, he can't even talk to anybody. messed up so yeah you're right about that I don't want him disappoint my kids promising them things and then not going through with it yeah. that's not."
480.0,Provider,"me because, when it's your parents you constantly want to think they're going to change or forgive them because it's a natural tie, you have to them. Right so it's not like a friend, where you can just cut them out and move on you're always going to want your dad to be in their life it's just unfortunate that he's not mature enough to be able to be."
9555.0,Patient,"Great I mean obviously i've not even thought about that with my mom. My mom but my dad I definitely. wanted to be there, but he obviously doesn't so. It is what it is the messed up thing is is I just started talking to him a couple years ago and he seemed like you know he wanted to be in my life but. Anthony kind of pointed out, something the other day, when he was talking to him, like money doesn't buy happiness and when he was talking to me he just kept trying to buy me a bunch of shit and give me money, and all this stuff like I don't want that, like no no right."
480.0,Provider,"Right well and it almost makes me wonder if your dad's even capable of having a genuine connection with another human being, because if he if he's in the kind of marriage he's in which is mainly based on money and control and power. and manipulation, then maybe he's not even capable of having a real connection with someone."
9555.0,Patient,"Well i'm you say that but I sent him this big long message one day and I basically told him, you know, like I loved him and appreciated him a lot, because he did something for me, though, you know. He didn't have to do and I didn't really ask him to do, he just did it and. He like sent me a thumbs up emoji and I was like you know I love you a lot like basically you know spilled my heart out a little bit to him and he, like just send me a thumbs up i'm like wow okay like you."
480.0,Provider,"can't stand when people do that or when like you have this whole emotional thing and then they just have a reaction to your you know, on the iphones you can just react to the text. yeah like really that's it that's all I get."
9555.0,Patient,Basically.
480.0,Provider,So frustrating. It is.
9555.0,Patient,he's like I don't do all that stuff i'm like yeah clearly.
480.0,Provider,"Well, at least, you know now that you just can't expect anything from him."
9555.0,Patient,You.
480.0,Provider,"A hard lesson to learn, but it also will save you a lot of grief and heartache down the road trying to keep like because that's. natural human tendency, we all want connection with people we care about and love, and so we make these little bids for connection and every time those bids get rejected it like. affects our self esteem are worth or value and all of that So the sooner, you can stop making those bids, with people you know aren't going to return them, the better actually as far as healing those. But again it's not pleasant because it's your family so you're always going to desire."
9555.0,Patient,"You that makes a lot of sense. Right yeah i'm glad I found out sooner than later, and not put my kids through that."
480.0,Provider,"October appointment. Do you want to. agile, is there a better day time do you like this Friday at one o'clock."
9555.0,Patient,This works okay.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, we can do. 1529. All right, I will put you down for that and."
9555.0,Patient,"Also, one."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that one. 1529 and, of course, email me a few, if anything, comes up in the meantime."
9555.0,Patient,I will.
480.0,Provider,"Alright, have a good weekend take care."
9555.0,Patient,"Thank you, you too."
480.0,Provider,bye bye.
