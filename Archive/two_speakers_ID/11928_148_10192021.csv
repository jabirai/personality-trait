148.0,Provider,how's it going.
11928.0,Patient,Not too bad.
148.0,Provider,Okay.
11928.0,Patient,I can vent a little.
148.0,Provider,what's been going on him in.
11928.0,Patient,"High middle. Tired. stressed out stretch. You know i'm really good at putting myself in. positions. I don't know trying to prove myself I don't know to myself to my immediate surrounding whatever. But. When we started the program like yes. I mentioned that you know, on basically taking care of two full time jobs and one goal was to find a balance and. Try to create a balance between my work life and. Family life take care of myself, but I guess I have lost sight of that at all. um. I got a promotion you're aware of that, three weeks ago with my office job. My father has been sick he he's been the one mostly running the construction business, but since two months ago i've been the main man on the field. We wrapped up a few projects, but we also started another project last week. um i've been very fortunate to have the trust of my friends and family. Being in the construction business. You know my friends they're always telling me that hey we have some money in the bank why don't we just do something with it you're good at finding properties flipping properties let's chip in and buy something, and you know I always had that in the back of my mind. i'm not doing drugs in the past two months I finally found the energy to follow up on that idea um you know what. I have offer for about a million dollar from different friends four or five of them um you know I collected about $500,000 I found the property we put an offer i've been putting offers in properties for the past four weeks never got any but finally one of them went through I. bought a nice property Piedmontese I don't know how familiar, you are with Bay area but. it's a nice town in in Bay area so um when you're buying a property there's a lot of paperwork. loan appraisal so i'm going through that. Targeting to close the sale in two weeks. And once that done, I have a proper team my hand to flip. Through the remodeling and whatnot. Ah. My wife used to work until two years ago, when the covert hit so. She was making about $150,000 a year now that she's not working i'm trying to find ways to. catch up for what she has left behind so um I don't know putting all that, together, sometimes you know. At the end of the night i'm just looking back and see wow so many teams, I have done, and I have done it right, but. I don't think it's sustainable. For long you know. office work engineering work might my mind is that, like four different places at a given time project workers home depot office communication email propose all buying your property it's just. I don't know if anyone can pull that off or pool I I. I do it, but I don't know if I can do it for long, and you know it short stresses me out and that's not good, I, I know that, so I don't know. it's just one of those. One of those things."
148.0,Provider,It sounds like you're spread really thin right now and you're feeling the pressure that you're feeling overwhelmed and you're feeling stressed.
11928.0,Patient,"yep That summarizes it. yeah so yeah I talked to Dr long. And he said, maybe, maybe that's something you want to talk to Ashley and canal so here I am talking about it. I know it's not right at the end of the day, or at the end of the month, when the money comes in it's rewarding God. You know. it's one of those things it's I guess it's greed. Or maybe it's fear of. Not having you know financial resources to take care of my family I don't think it's great because i'm not a greedy person, but I just want to make sure you know I can take care of my family there is enough for them, I don't know."
148.0,Provider,"And is there anything that you see that you could take a step back from because, like you said right now i'm doing all this right, I have all these different moving parts going on and. You can do it right you're capable of doing it you've shown that But for how long can you do this for before just completely too much right before it's really affecting your your mental physical health right So do you see anything. worth taking a step back from."
11928.0,Patient,"yeah I have, I mean what I described was just the main ones on the side you know I bought a van to like converted and remodel it. Ah, I always wanted like create a site business for van conversion and that's that's another thing so. Maybe I can wrap up some of the little things and try to get held on managing those I mean I I think of Elon musk every once in a while he's he's my idol right. He is sending rocket to this guy he's building cars, he has tesla he has the space X, he is digging tunnels under the ground he's in health care, but, but he he's good at putting together teams and systems that's. that's healthy and sustainable and he's just involved at a high level, so my goal is to establish these businesses. But stay involved at a high level right so that's that's the idea, I have to put that a little bit more time in creating the system. And Disconnecting myself from them, because all of those you know they have good potential. There are good ideas and i'm good at execution but. But I have to find a way to. make it more sustainable, creating a system that's. Self sustained and doesn't demand me per se on a daily basis."
148.0,Provider,"Right, so what i'm hearing you say is you need more support, and you can expect yourself to do all these things, all the time by yourself."
11928.0,Patient,Oh yeah I know that that's that's right that's right mm hmm. yeah.
148.0,Provider,"What is what do first steps look like, for you. You said a couple of different things there, he said, you know kind of. wrapping up your smaller projects that you have going then really getting more support, with the bigger stuff So what does that look like, for you."
11928.0,Patient,"Getting alignment with my father and my mom because they're involved in part of the construction business and I guess my father was. really active now he's frustrated that he. can't like get out of the House he's physical health is not in a good condition and my management style is completely different than he's so we started to have some friction there. I have to sort out a few things so when i'm putting together that system he's he's not in a position to come in and. disrupt things from working. See. So um yeah just. My main concern is that. i've been planning to go do some blood work and test that doctor put for me, I never had the chance to do it so. I guess my main goal is to find the time to. pay it a little bit more attention to my physical health and stay on my doctor's visit it will sound like activity workout um. I can turn teens overnight. I mean my office job is there there's nothing I can do with the office job. i'm trying to change the business model for our construction company to buy properties ourselves with the angel investors that we have and do less for people that gives us a little bit more control over project schedule timing deliverables because we own the project. So that takes off the stress a little bit, so we are now in the transition. To create that new model with the purchase of these house in Piedmont so after i'm done with my project in menlo Park, I told my father that maybe it's best not to take any new projects, so this is expected to be completed by mid December, so I have to like sustain myself. Somehow. To complete this project, and then I just left alone with the proper team Piedmont, and my office for can hopefully I can wrap up the Van conversion and put that idea to decide and I guess that puts me in a comfortable position as far as maintaining myself and the workload."
148.0,Provider,"Then. Again, so gonna say we definitely have a similar concern here, because my next question was going to be what time, are you giving to yourself."
11928.0,Patient,New Year like January I need to be in a position to say yeah it's time to take some rest.
148.0,Provider,And yeah.
11928.0,Patient,"I mean, I always have a plan you know, there is no problem, no challenge in my life that. i'm dealing with and I don't have a plan for. And i'm typically good in execution sometimes you know things drag it a little bit, but. I mean I, I do have a plan so comes January I should be in a position to be a lot more comfortable with the workload."
148.0,Provider,Good good yeah they have a lot of self awareness around the stressors and what you have going on and how it's affecting you and you also have a plan to work through it and to get to a more comfortable space for yourself So is there anything else you'd like to see.
11928.0,Patient,"i'll just spending more time with my family, you know. we're going to Hawaii you know I really liked that time and travel so. Our. office is closed for 15 days from mid December to January, so, if I can take that two weeks and do some traveling that would be nice."
148.0,Provider,"awesome okay yeah some more time dedicated to yourself, more time dedicated to your family. And just I think overall more balance in your life right."
11928.0,Patient,yeah that's that's the goal.
148.0,Provider,Good good yeah that sounds like a good plan um how are you feeling about your recovery.
11928.0,Patient,"it's good you know i've been keeping myself busy except that one or two weeks of. friction with CBS and you know, honestly, I never had the time to follow up on my complaints you know, I was pretty worked up and I was furious but. Wait buying that property, you know I. Almost forgot about it, and maybe that's how that's their policy, you know they don't respond to complaints, hoping that people you know get tired and just go away and that's basically what happened to me so but that's not a decent way of running a business so. You know I let go off that but yeah i'm happy with the recovery sometimes working with bright heart is. A little draining in terms of communication, like I received email from Leslie all the time that oh mom please call back to the call Center so I I mean. I received a text message that hey you lost an appointment and we charge you a $50 penalty so i'm calling back and i'm like what what appointment did I use the said. You didn't attend the group session i'm like yeah he attended degree what what group session are you talking about they said marries group session i'm like wait i'm not even part of mary's group session. Mary Mary told me to go to her group session only when I need a refill. So I, so I attended the group session to tell Mary hi Mary how are you I need a refill and she said Okay, thank you, I put the refills for you anything else, I can do, I said no, thank you bye bye. So somehow the computer or the system recognizes me as part of group session because I attend that that one's for the refill and now. I received communication that i'm missing marries group session her bright parts policy, you cannot even be part of to group session. at a given time so i'm telling that guys it's not even legal to be part of two different group sessions give my $50 bags. And then stopped flagging me for not for for missing my appointments because he's just throwing my record, so they they they haven't fixed that Dr long say don't worry all try to fix that for you, that didn't work. And you know, with all the surveys and group calls and psychiatry Stan therapists than two full time jobs i'm. trying hard to find the time to attend the sessions. And then In addition I I keep receiving Dino from Leslie that I have to call back so I called back and nobody knows what's going on and like there is nothing in your record. And and i'm telling Leslie it would be nice if you just said, please tell me in the email what's the subject, I mean do you want me to call back to say what because nobody can see anything so i'm i'm i'm a little disappointed on the way they're handling teams because. I don't have the time to call like five times to try to correct a computer glitch at breitbart right, so I don't know I am i'm a little disappointed, so when you ask how's my recovery, I guess, it would have been nice to have it a little less. drive. that's not necessary, but."
148.0,Provider,"Right now, I hear you and I know this doesn't take away the time you spent i'm feeling frustrated over that situation, I apologize for that, but I am looking at your chart. And i'm only seeing one group now versus before, when I looked I saw mary's in here too, so you shouldn't have any issues with that moving forward that does look like it's been worse."
11928.0,Patient,"we'll see if that happens again because next week, I have to attend mary's group session again to ask for the refill and i'm hoping that. don't start this cycle again because it that it seems to be a computer glitch."
148.0,Provider,"yeah so as long as it's there's only one group showing in your chart, which is the one on Friday 2pm with Dr London Cindy. You should be fine just popping into mary's group when you need to communicate with her otherwise just keep going to your Friday group at 2pm meeting with me every two weeks, and then doing your surveys."
11928.0,Patient,sounds good. sounds good.
148.0,Provider,Everything else looks good here your attendance looks really good to other than a no show you had on the 15th. That.
11928.0,Patient,"What is the 15th I mean I I was at Dr lungs group session on 15th I just attended the four o'clock instead of two o'clock and I talked to Dr I call that two o'clock and said, Dr. I have a meeting at two o'clock with my team and that's only this week is it Okay, if I call you at four o'clock and attend to four o'clock group session, and he says yeah that's perfectly fine. So that's what I did. I called back at four o'clock and attended the photo club group session I don't know why he chose that I didn't attend. The group session on 15th because I did so, these are the teams that's frustrating that you know i'm I just have to call back and keep correcting director."
148.0,Provider,"OK, I will put in a message to your care navigator letting her know to change that no show to a cancellation, since you canceled with Dr Allen prior and confirm that you can do the 4pm group instead of the 2pm group, you did do a group with him at 4pm on tooth or on Friday right."
11928.0,Patient,I did I did yeah. I was there at 4pm.
148.0,Provider,yeah i'll send a message about that then i'm going to get that taken care of.
11928.0,Patient,"Thank you, I really appreciate it."
148.0,Provider,yeah um. Anything else I can support you today.
11928.0,Patient,"No, do you want to schedule a lot of next appointment."
148.0,Provider,"Yes, I do my calendar again here."
11928.0,Patient,"same day, two weeks. 130."
148.0,Provider,"And yes, so Tuesday November 2 I don't have 130 open I have 2pm open."

148.0,Provider,Tuesday November 2 at 2pm.
11928.0,Patient,Okay. Dr Ashley Tuesday November 2 2pm boom.
148.0,Provider,"Perfect um. Okay, oh man, I will. Again, I will send a message to eileen your care navigator about that no show coming up from Friday and get that fixed. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing really great i'm definitely work on taking more time for yourself and your self care, and you know the things that you need like spending more time with your family. Otherwise, it sounds like you're really stable in your recovery right now so Keep up the good work."
11928.0,Patient,Thank you. And I will thank you.
148.0,Provider,And I will see you in two weeks okay.
11928.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay, thank you."
