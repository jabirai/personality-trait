480.0,Provider,Hello. How are you.
14641.0,Patient,Good how are you.
480.0,Provider,"So okay little intro to therapy, have you been in therapy before. No okay so basically what we do an individual, the first session is just kind of like an overview of your history, whatever you want to tell me from like childhood, up until now that you think is going to be relevant. um and then at the end of this session today we'll kind of talk about goals for like what we want to work on an individual therapy, but my biggest thing is this time is for you. So whatever you feel like you need if ever we're talking about things and you're like that's not helpful just let me know because I want this to be productive for."
14641.0,Patient,You so um.
480.0,Provider,So let's start with like growing up childhood family dynamics tell me about that.
14641.0,Patient,"yeah so um I grew up with an older sister she was she's six years older than me so i'm the youngest. My parents, we lived in holly spring, when we were both little, and then we moved to pittsboro my parents. They built a house. On a bunch of land and we moved out there and then not like a long after that they did get a divorce. and me and my mom and my sister we all moved to raleigh."
480.0,Provider,"Okay. So, with all of this North Carolina. Okay."
14641.0,Patient,"Yes, I look back and pittsboro now. Oh God for through middle school and high school I live in raleigh. So. And then that's like where things started to go down for me."
480.0,Provider,Which maybe.
14641.0,Patient,"We add it's like because I was so young, we built that house and then I left all that behind don't really remember before that. Because I right so young, and then now i'm in raleigh and. Like I don't have my dad there my mom's trying to deal with two daughters single."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14641.0,Patient,Now my sister was six years older than me so she kind of was going crazy.
480.0,Provider,But she like middle school ish by the time he moved to raleigh.
14641.0,Patient,I think I was in middle school. So she was probably going going into high school. Or that.
480.0,Provider,I didn't really see your dad much after you moved.
14641.0,Patient,"No, I mean I saw him on the weekends, that was it and you know going back over there, it was just really awkward for me I didn't feel like I had a good relationship with my dad because I didn't have time right. away so soon."
480.0,Provider,And my teeth day at the House with all the land that they know okay.
14641.0,Patient,"yeah and you know so when we moved rolla you know I started make friends um you know we started there with school and stuff so on the weekends, he will come pick me up and take me back here, and it would be so awkward you know I wouldn't be around my friends. yeah my dad he didn't know what to do you know, but he made the best of it, you know when he would take us to the movies and buy a bunch of food and and me and my sister were doing that for a while, like."
480.0,Provider,To go back and forth.
14641.0,Patient,"yeah so. And then eventually she stopped coming on the weekends, because she was older."
480.0,Provider,And she didn't want to get friends yeah.
14641.0,Patient,"And I started to get that way to i'm like why don't want to either. I don't want to have on myself. And we really didn't have a good relationship with him because we were just so ya know we didn't have time to build that all the way up and they're middle school and. i'm okay. Thank you, honey. And then my mom remarried to a psycho person. And we hated him he hated us. So um. You know that happened my sister was going crazy going out and doing things and yeah you know, I was looking up to her she's because she's my older sister so i've always looked up to her. mm hmm and I started going crazy. huh and then my mom divorced that guy. He was crazy she's like he was mean to he was weird like. So my mom was like look my girls don't like you, you gotta go, you know, like."
480.0,Provider,"i'm glad she realized that I mean. Would it be helpful before she married him, but at least eventually she realized that."
14641.0,Patient,yeah and she was just trying to like. I don't know make a point or something to get remarried or you know. It was all of weird dramatic change. yeah oh.
480.0,Provider,"mom have a good relationship through most of this. Yes, okay."
14641.0,Patient,"i've always been really attached to my mom. Now me and my dad's relationship is better than ever I looked away from him I see him I see him more than I see my mouse. My son he loves his grandson and. my sister has two kids two but they're a little bit older, obviously. But yeah you have a good relationship now. So."
480.0,Provider,"So what's it like high school which, when you started getting into drugs and stuff was it."
14641.0,Patient,I didn't do any drugs for high school.
480.0,Provider,"Oh well, okay."
14641.0,Patient,"It was when I was. I eventually moved I eventually met I husband now. Not now, when I was 21 maybe 22 not 21. let's see I had my son, when I was 23, so I think I met him when I was like 22. wow that's crazy okay. I met him when I was 22 um and that's when it started like I think started. um you know I got. Somebody give me a pill or something and like after the first time it was fine, but like. After the second or third time I was oh. yeah just went down from there."
480.0,Provider,"what's your husband also using. Now, so you were hiding it from him."
14641.0,Patient,"Well, he did, using the beginning yeah. yeah so we're kind of both doing that. um. But he doesn't anymore."
480.0,Provider,Do you feel like he was ever addicted or he was more like a social user.
14641.0,Patient,He was probably addicted yeah.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
14641.0,Patient,I think we both were.
480.0,Provider,So then he got pregnant. Like a year later.
14641.0,Patient,Not even probably three months after I met them. I want to kiss.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, it was a conscious decision that's all yeah. And then, so you and your husband are still together. Yes, so did both and. try to get clean, at the same time, like have you tried before is this your first attempt."
14641.0,Patient,"We tried many, many times. Until Finally I don't know I just found this place right heart health and I was you know I called them they're like well it's going to take like 35 minutes to get all the Info and it's up to you, if you want to do it, and I was like. Oh, you know it's like God, what if it doesn't work out or you know what like I can't do it or get it, and then ended up working out like so fast and easy that it was too good to be true. yeah i'm you know, and I took took suboxone before you know, but like I didn't. treat yeah and I didn't like, for my. Friends mom and I never had enough, I never had enough and I said this isn't working if this doesn't work what's going to work, you know but it's because I was taking a little piece, at a time."
480.0,Provider,You know right you didn't know the random says and whatnot.
14641.0,Patient,"Well, I knew if I took more it would help, but I just couldn't. Wait me and him were both rationing it out to the two of us so. yeah you know um. yeah. So, ever since I started here a month in like a half ago I haven't done any posts. I know."
480.0,Provider,So awesome.
14641.0,Patient,"That doesn't mean that I don't want to, but. Now."
480.0,Provider,"But like we were talking about in group that will go away the wanting to the craving. And all of that, even just the thoughts of it will go away over time it's just your brain still trying to get back to some sense of normalcy."
14641.0,Patient,"yeah like cuz I was thinking i'm like do I have to take I don't want to take suboxone forever I don't even want to take it for. Three years at the most yeah yeah I don't or two years, I want to take it for six months and be done with it. yeah you know."
480.0,Provider,that's fair.
14641.0,Patient,Because that stuff's hard to get off of to.
480.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and that's something I like how Dr Marshall explains that it's. Not that you're addicted to suboxone but your body becomes dependent on it. And so, a lot of people don't like the idea of having to be dependent on something. And it's not a bad thing it's a personal choice you know what I mean, so I do know that she's pretty pretty strict on the whole, like don't even start tapering down until it's been at least six months. which I think is good, because that gives you enough time to mentally get stable into recovery and then. and start tapering down, but I like that you have that physical."
14641.0,Patient,hold on one second I think my son dumped the whole apple juice. What are you doing. Okay i'm sorry.
480.0,Provider,"that's fine I get three boys, so I remember. I do."
14641.0,Patient,My mine.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah it was fun I had So the first two are. 18 months apart and then the third was born a month and a half before the first turn three so I literally had 303.
14641.0,Patient,"Oh, my God I. Like seriously commend you for that. that's hard."
480.0,Provider,It was bad it was. A girl.
14641.0,Patient,"I mean boys. boys are the best, in my opinion, but they are a different breed."
480.0,Provider,"It well it's like what. you're saying it's just like they don't care about making message to them that's fun, so it was non stop just dump everything on the floor all the time, the like hitting the BAT pounding things on the wall it's just all. The energy."
14641.0,Patient,yeah yeah I know like he just pops up of apple juice overflowing to the top. and gave one to me and it's like. they're like sour patch kids he was like here mommy I made you some apple juice i'm like.
480.0,Provider,"guys, is he for you said he's for. yeah yeah that's a. fun age, I do actually miss like so I don't miss having three of them that age, but I do. Miss those toddler ages so. yeah. So how are you and your husband now like how's your relationship did it get rocky ever when you guys were using."
14641.0,Patient,yeah it's been up and down forever.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14641.0,Patient,"Now you know. He he has his own issues and he's constantly you know it will get into a rough patch and he'll constantly accuse me of cheating or just crazy stuff you know that's like making me pull away from him for real like I don't want like. If i'm if you're accusing me of cheating constantly that I might as well just get it, you know, like. I have never cheated on him, so I don't deserve that you know."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's The thing is a lot of times men like that, who are constantly accusing their partners of cheating, or like suspicious of that comes from deep insecurity and. That it just like you said it tends to push us away because we're drawn to men that are confident and secure and not only that, but like constantly hearing you're cheating you're cheating or cheating obviously shows he doesn't trust you and trust is. Yet, an important part of a relationship and even though his lack of trust has nothing to do with you because you haven't deserved it you haven't earned the lack of trust his insecurity is. Doing that which is the problem right because that's not something you can change or fix. So what do you do with. That like when he's accusing you of cheating, do you guys argue, do you kind of just. not talk for a while what's kind of the pattern."
14641.0,Patient,"Well, at first, you know we would argue, but now i'm just like okay that's what you want to think fine. Like i'm so tired of trying to defend myself. or nothing."
480.0,Provider,So.
14641.0,Patient,"I think coaches or not, and if it doesn't get better if you can't trust me if you can't like I mean it was getting to the point where he was calling me if I could leave the House in five minutes he would call me Where are you at what are you doing, are you live. Or if I go to the store, what are you doing, who are you like or and I come home with groceries. Who did you go see like. I wasn't gone for 30 minutes, how would I have gone to the grocery store gotta everything and then go into somebody's somebody's house and cheated on you. Mind you, we live in a small town where everything is at least 1515 minute drive away. yeah so it's like."
480.0,Provider,yeah it's not logical at all.
14641.0,Patient,"No, not logical sometimes tell him like. You know this just."
480.0,Provider,doesn't work like you. Think bond during the day. yeah okay. So is that helpful to kind of have space during the day. So things went on. are more sane less chaotic like you have a good routine with your son.
14641.0,Patient,"I mean it's Okay, for me, but my son doesn't listen to me like he listens to his dad. So he goes crazy insane and i'm constantly having to discipline them constantly having to. You know, be there when his dad's around you know he can take control and my son he just knows, not to act up like that you know. and You know so and that, but when he's around you know it's good for him my son, but it's bad for me, sometimes. Right yeah I want to be alone. And when he's not here it's bad for me, because my son doesn't listen. yeah so."
480.0,Provider,You ever get alone time like does he ever let you go take a day.
14641.0,Patient,yeah every I mean every day literally. You know if he gets home on time i'll go in my room. Good and just like take a bath or do my nails or just lay down.
480.0,Provider,And compression.
14641.0,Patient,yeah like I just want silence.
480.0,Provider,yeah yes.
14641.0,Patient,um and you know I babysit during the day to another little boy. wow yeah so I have them both with me all day. wow and and there's also three more kids that that I was a little boy siblings and they get home but they go to school and they get home later yeah.
480.0,Provider,So you have four kids half the day. Five five wow oh my God.
14641.0,Patient,"The end of the day, I have five kids. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Do. It at all, or is anyway okay."
14641.0,Patient,"I do you know at first for the longest time i'm like God, I really don't like it, and I still really don't like kids."
480.0,Provider,I get it.
14641.0,Patient,Like I really don't but they they're good kids i'm blessed because they are good kids and. You know they're smart and i'm making money. If I stayed home for four years. And didn't do anything.
480.0,Provider,"So now i'm finally being hard like on our self esteem as a mom because we don't get rewarded or. harmed or appreciated for doing stay at home mom stuff. So it's really hard like I had a phase where I was a stay at home mom and I was so desperate to get back to work, but financially it made more sense for me to stay home."
14641.0,Patient,"You know right yeah. But this way you know I can take call in with me. um I don't have to pay for childcare. it's right down, oh no not at your House. No, I go to her house."
480.0,Provider,She lives that's actually probably easier.
14641.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah yeah cuz i'm like I was desperate to get out of here. yeah man it felt like the walls were coming in, on me. yeah I felt like shit. couldn't be high all day. So I would only get them at night because. You know."
480.0,Provider,wow.
14641.0,Patient,I didn't have time to do it during the day. So. yeah it's better now get out of the House for a little bit.
480.0,Provider,How long have you been doing that.
14641.0,Patient,"i'm not very long, maybe like a month now. Maybe me three four weeks so and she pays me good money too so."
480.0,Provider,"that's helpful. And calling gets, along with other kids."
14641.0,Patient,"So you know he's been home with me for ever. So you know when he got over there and the boys he's a little bit younger than con so you know when we got there when the first thing whole thing started. When the whole thing started. Like it was really hard like he didn't get the concept of like sharing and you know playing together taking turns things like that. So it was really hard for me. And a little really good for him to learn that, because the."
480.0,Provider,"Later, you put that off, the harder it is for the kids to learn and adjust their behavior."
14641.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely that's why i'm like I was trying to get them into preschool like if he can even still be at preschool right now, while i'm over there, that would be awesome. Because he needs to be around kids you need somebody other than his mom disciplining him yeah telling him what to do. yeah and that's really hard on me because i'm like, but then he knows, but then again he'll do something mean or and he is me he is mean to the little boy. i'm like. Why, why do you have to be mean you know I know this is a big change you're having to learn to share and take turns and all that, but you know when you're being mean you know so and I don't allow that we're not going to be a bully you know. Ah, and the little boys like you know what the hell is going on three other siblings."
480.0,Provider,You know right and.
14641.0,Patient,"You know it's just hard it's just like a. Constant constant like he does not give a break, he is constantly and I don't know if it's because you know. He thinks i'm care he doesn't really understand the concept of i'm working i'm looking after this little boy, you know I think he thinks i'm taking you know i'm giving him more my attention which I don't. Read when I do give them attention you know he's probably like Why is. Your mom. holding him yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Such a totally natural for kids to do that because. that's something I used to have kids extra kids with me all the time when my kids were little and they all went through phases, where they'd be pissed about it. Like if I want to hold a baby they'd come over and start just completely acting out of character to get my attention because they were mad I was holding a baby."
14641.0,Patient,"yeah and I remember feeling like that to look at my mom did anything like with another child. I would. It would break my heart. yeah it would rip my heart out like. And, looking back i'm like I know she didn't love that child more than me so. No, you know."
480.0,Provider,"there's such a like kids can't understand that. When you have the ability to give a child back to their parents you tolerate a lot more right so that's the hard part for me with parenting is balancing. How I treat my kids versus how I treat neighborhood kids that come over right, because obviously i'm a lot nicer to the neighborhood kids I don't really. Discipline them because they're not my children that's not my job, you know, so my kids are finally at the age where they can. they're eight to 11 so they can understand that now. But it was really hard in the toddler years because they don't understand that concept, they don't know that like well, the only reason i'm tolerating all of this is because it's not my child and that's not my place to discipline, you know. So, when you say parenting currently is your biggest stressor just like trying to balance the boundaries and the discipline and all of that, or do you think relationship is more of a stressor for you."
14641.0,Patient,"um sometimes you know, at times, I feel like they're like head to head no like my relationship my parenting everything's gone oh shit you know. But right now, you know me and my husband he's he's trying to let off of me, you know, like give me my space trust me don't call me don't freak out don't. You know, and so you know given me a little less stress. So i'm more you know. i'm able to parent. you're. in bed, and you know focus on my son."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14641.0,Patient,"You know and i'm not so consumed with you know cheating on somebody or even know he makes things up in his head that I have a whole nother life I have a whole nother husband and family like no I don't even talk to another guy. yeah and i'm telling you, I have no reason to lie. Like."
480.0,Provider,Right disease yeah you're.
14641.0,Patient,"Like I. You know, I have no reason to like if I was like yeah I am you know cheating on him, you know so but he's constantly accusing me of cheating, but he doesn't know that i'm cheating on him yeah for real for real. I don't know if that makes sense, but you know that would be one thing, but i'm not right, you know."
480.0,Provider,Do you think he knows that this is all his own insecure party or do you think there's a part of him that actually believes that you're cheating.
14641.0,Patient,I think both probably.
480.0,Provider,"Okay cuz. Like he's just got like super anxious attachment style right so anytime you're not giving him reassurance or validation in the relationship. he's gonna like you said, create stories in his mind of why the relationship is not going to work and so that's a hard. Hard balance for. him his first he has to recognize that that's where it's coming from is the. stories in his head and then like the way you deal with that, like, if I were his therapist I would be saying Okay, you have to look at the evidence right so let's logically look at the evidence that shows that these stories can't be true. Which means they're from anxiety and that's the part that like i'm glad you can see that but eventually we need him to see that."
14641.0,Patient,Just harder yeah and I do think it. From a lot of his insecurity.
480.0,Provider,"yeah and he probably had some trauma growing up, he probably had some family dynamics that made him question whether or not he would be safe and loved because that's usually where that stuff comes from. But just perfectly understandable it's just at the same time he doesn't need to continue projecting that all on to you when there's no evidence that you're doing any of that."
14641.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I mean his parents his mom is like I mean he always told me he was like my dad he never taught me anything you never cared about me and my sister that's what he would say. So. I feel like he might have like thank you said, like yeah like my parents never done anything for me, I mean they literally live right next door and we don't see them ever. And they have a grandchild."
480.0,Provider,yeah I don't see ooh.
14641.0,Patient,because she got mad about something so she's staying her ass over there.
480.0,Provider,Oh wow. Now. In laws are the best.
14641.0,Patient,"know, since she Oh, she just passed."
480.0,Provider,"Oh man okay so. far it is. therapy focus for you, what do you think you want to focus on so just some ideas coping skills is a good one right a lot of people want to focus on coping skills parenting relationship stuff I know it doesn't sound like you have any major trauma but processing like. The divorce, because that was probably your most significant trauma right."
14641.0,Patient,"yeah and other things have happened to um but I, you know I know this doesn't go on for an hour so maybe we can talk about next time."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, like."
14641.0,Patient,I just don't even want to go into it right now.
480.0,Provider,"i'm not something to like in order to process trauma, you have to have good coping skills, because you don't want to bring up stuff that's going to re traumatize you and then leave the meeting and have all these. Emotions and then it's going to lead to wanting to use so like i'm okay with not getting super deep into trauma yet. Because we want to make sure you're safe when we process all the trauma."
14641.0,Patient,"yeah and you know I haven't really ever talked about it with anybody before, but like you know i'll tell you. Because I really like you i'm glad to have you to talk to."
480.0,Provider,i'm glad to.
14641.0,Patient,Like you.
480.0,Provider,"Well, good yeah and definitely like. i'm very. receptive to feedback like I said before, so i'm not going to push you to do anything you don't want to do i'm not gonna push you to talk about anything you don't want to talk about um. So, if ever. We start going in a direction you're like not ready for that just let me know i'm totally open to it."
14641.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"So what works for you as far as scheduling because we need to do at least two appointments a month for compliance for bright heart, I do have some people I see weekly, but at this point my schedules pretty bold. I know we have another appointment think it's the 26 right yeah so Tuesday the 26th at 11. We have another appointment."
14641.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"So then going from there, like what time do you go to. nanny at the other house."
14641.0,Patient,"Well i'm supposed to be there now. But I told her i'm like yesterday I couldn't be there until after my zoom so weekly group and then today, it was like backtrack she probably thinks i'm not flying out like crazy sorry."
480.0,Provider,that's terrifying.
14641.0,Patient,he's look he's scratched me he's still a kitten and.
480.0,Provider,He has.
14641.0,Patient,"He has his. You know, he hasn't been spayed yet so he's."
480.0,Provider,"Oh look in. Here, he is crazy so cute."
14641.0,Patient,Say hi.
480.0,Provider,See look at him he's fighting. And scratching I desperately want an orange cat. I can't do.
14641.0,Patient,"Oh, my God i've always wanted to a ginger cat."
480.0,Provider,"yeah I mean I do too I just, I have three dogs and a cat now, so I was like we gotta wait till some of them die and then we'll get more pets."
14641.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
480.0,Provider,"To my dogs are old, though, like 13 and 14 so. it's expected um okay so so like an 11 o'clock appointment does that mess with work or can you do it from her house."
14641.0,Patient,"um, I guess, I could do it from there, I mean it might be a little chaotic with the boys and I don't know how good her her Internet kind of sucks um is there any way you could do it earlier in the day earlier in the morning."
480.0,Provider,"mm hmm not Okay, so I can't do anything earlier on that day, what if we do this let's leave the 26 at 11 and just see how it goes like if it's a total shit show because of the kids then we just won't do anymore at 11 i'm."
14641.0,Patient,Okay that's fine.
480.0,Provider,"And then. yeah and then. Well, the November ones we. can definitely schedule for earlier does nine o'clock work that like what time you actually supposed to be there. Oh yeah see I can't do earlier than."
14641.0,Patient,Like no. that's too early for me anyway. cuz I gotta get ready and wake out.
480.0,Provider,"yeah well we feel 11 o'clock and see how it goes and then we'll wait and schedule November appointments after that appointment, so we know whether or not that time works."
14641.0,Patient,"Okay, and maybe if I sit outside with them and they fire something it'll be fine."
480.0,Provider,"And it's usually I mean most of the time for individual it's Okay, if you have other stuff going on right because. You have enough. Time to talk it's like having a conversation on a phone with a friend, like most. of my friends are moms. So I expect that they're not like giving me their full attention 100% of the time which is fine, you know. So i'm totally okay with that and just I don't know if you smoke, but just fyi for you individual therapy does not have the group rules, so you don't have to have headphones you can smoke you convey. You can do whatever I still know driving that's the only rule that applies to individual therapy as well."
