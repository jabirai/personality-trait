17294.0,Patient,"How often. I don't see her like. I don't see this. Last month, no this month I don't see her I because I need my new medications so they give me my new medications I don't see her that much."
324.0,Provider,For everything i'm asking you're only on five milligrams of the telephone and you've been on it for two months. and it's not helping. Your anxiety.
17294.0,Patient,"yeah it's not happy me, that much is helping me just little bit, and it goes away and they come back again so you guys you don't give meditation."
324.0,Provider,"Well, we do, but if you have someone that you're saying already. You can't have. I can prescribe medication, but I can't give you medication and then you have another."
17294.0,Patient,"Not the other. The other one I can make a cancel if you give me medication. I can make the tensor because i'm not happy, I don't see like babe getting better you know."
324.0,Provider,"Okay well that's why I was asking how often do you see the other provider. Because it seems like you need to make some changes. Because sitting at that dose is not helping your anxiety. Know you've been at five milligrams for two or three months. And it's not helping. Lou and you start when you increase the dose during party gets worse. Yes, so that means there needs to be some changes."
17294.0,Patient,"Changes right, especially when i'm driving. You know when i'm driving I feel more."
324.0,Provider,Okay. Have you ever ever ever put you on mute for all for your inciting use far.
17294.0,Patient,what's that.
324.0,Provider,anxiety.
17294.0,Patient,medication you mean. uh huh what's the knee. what's the those.
324.0,Provider,Are the starting dose this five milligram.
17294.0,Patient,Oh again five milligram.
324.0,Provider,"uh huh but you would increase it fine over is, it will be twice a day, five milligrams twice a day. For about a week, then 10 milligrams 15 usually most people are on 50 milligrams twice a day."
17294.0,Patient,This one they don't make you sleep correct.
324.0,Provider,"As one of the side effects, you might have a little sedation."
17294.0,Patient,"Okay. Because I I drive sometimes that's why. Because you saying this medication, you can take. in the morning and afternoon. Question if i'm going to be practice, I cannot take this medications on."
324.0,Provider,"Whether concern. Especially on the first time, are you currently pregnant or do you think that you might be."
17294.0,Patient,"Low we thinking to have wavy thinking, because we try this month because i'm because they told me, you should check anxiety medication it's not good correct."
324.0,Provider,I want to say you take the power from the category.
17294.0,Patient,Because. yeah.
324.0,Provider,"Okay yeah just like I was saying, the medication that you're on now is a category that is called risk category C and what that means is is not generally recommend it to take during pregnancy, especially in the early stages, the first trimester."
17294.0,Patient,So it's not good to take in when you when you're going to get pregnant huh.
324.0,Provider,No.
17294.0,Patient,No okay.
324.0,Provider,"America abuse, for all that I was just talking about is a category be. All the, although this is not generally recommend it and, quite honestly, it tends to be safer."
17294.0,Patient,So it's not good to check in.
324.0,Provider,"You know, really, no matter what medication. and Especially the antidepressants. they're generally going to be the same category it, you know they're all in the same category, no matter what. What it boils down to is what we call risk versus. benefit meaning. there's there's that risk there to the fetus but, overall. The risk, as far as your mental health. as well, so, is it more of a benefit for you to stay on it for your mental health. Is a beauty part. Is a site for medication. yeah. yeah. same. thing and. here's my thing. If you are. In the process, you know i'm working on trying to conceive. and assume that most of these risks are in the early stages of pregnancy, the first trimester which will be the first three months. I would, maybe even. Instead of maybe fire medication. see it, starting with the therapy first. would be helpful and learning, you know coping skills and because you know, both in your individual and you're. In the Group sessions we do a lot of. Teaching on anxiety. Coping skills we do meditation. You know if you feel panic attack some. Things to help combat. You know keeps you grounded grounding techniques before it gets out of control, you might want to consider that. versus medication since you're trying to get pregnant."
17294.0,Patient,"I can't hear me, what are you saying you."
324.0,Provider,"know as. I was saying, you might want to consider. Trying therapy therapy sessions first to help control your anxiety, since you are trying to get pregnant. Because if there's that small risk. Of. Potentially hurting the fetus. Is in that in the early stages. of pregnancy."
17294.0,Patient,would happen.
324.0,Provider,"I was saying, in the early stages of pregnancy is when there's the most potential for the harm to the baby in the first three months of pregnancy. Okay, with these medications."
17294.0,Patient,We didn't mind medication or a new medication.
324.0,Provider,any of them.
17294.0,Patient,Oh i'm.
324.0,Provider,"Yours the medication that you're on now, it is also a category is the medication."
17294.0,Patient,So it's not good progress.
324.0,Provider,Right.
17294.0,Patient,it's not good to taking.
324.0,Provider,"In the first trimester is recommended that you don't. But when I say that I also explained the risk of taking the medication. versus the benefit of taking it. Let me explain it this way. yeah Let me explain it a little bit differently um. If I have, if I have a female. that's may be experiencing. psychosis. and very suicidal. Okay. Even though there may be a risk of taking the medication. But the benefit. of her mental health, so that she doesn't kill herself hurt herself. You would have to take that chance on giving her that medication, so that those things don't happen. So that's what I mean when I say risk versus the benefit of actually taking it if there's a chance this person is going to hurt herself or her baby. Try to hurt somebody else, then it means she needs to be on the medication, so you have there's that possibility that it might hurt the baby, but is more important that her mental health is stable. Does that make sense."
17294.0,Patient,So you mean better if i'm gonna i'm gonna try to get pregnant better to not take this meditation correct.
324.0,Provider,bro.
17294.0,Patient,"If i'm going to take this medication, you said it's not good for the baby."
324.0,Provider,Right in the first stages for.
17294.0,Patient,"Then I need to have groups mental mental and mental health, you said correct."
324.0,Provider,I would also your other provider. So you think someone else I will also discuss get another opinion and see what you see with your other provider let's say about that to have the other discussion.
17294.0,Patient,What is it.
324.0,Provider,Have you had this discussion with your other.
17294.0,Patient,providers.
324.0,Provider,"Know okay Okay, so your next appointment discuss it with him or her. as well to get another opinion on it. For right now, since you are in the stages of trying to get pregnant, I would say, maybe start with therapy sessions with us."
17294.0,Patient,I see.
324.0,Provider,and work on coping skills and coping mechanisms to help you deal with your anxiety.
17294.0,Patient,that's why yeah yes. So what do you think you think. you're right anything right now.
324.0,Provider,"My thing Okay, because you're saying somebody else so that's why. Because we can't. Again I don't want to respond something somebody else's prescribing."
17294.0,Patient,"Something oh Nice, he is."
324.0,Provider,"So that's why I was saying, if."
17294.0,Patient,You think. You think I need to talk to her about this.
324.0,Provider,"I went out, I asked us to her opinion on that would give her opinion as well let's see what she thinks about it."
17294.0,Patient,Okay i'm gonna. Tell about that i'm going to tell her wall it's not like i'm taking two months already three months i'm going to tell her it's not like had to me that much you know. But she told me if you're going to get pregnant don't take it.
324.0,Provider,that's what she told you.
17294.0,Patient,She told me that.
324.0,Provider,So we're really saying we're saying. Okay i'm.
17294.0,Patient,"So that's why I want to do the groups, you know for mental health healthy, you know, like getting better. And maybe I don't know I don't know what I need to say. But you know i'm just like telling you like the. Like I have like a nurse problems nurse, you know, like when i'm driving you know, especially, I feel that you guys who don't give nurse problems medication something to get to come down."
324.0,Provider,"If I were to give you anything, right now, it would probably be the abuse bar, because it is safer. To use."
17294.0,Patient,Like what.
324.0,Provider,Okay you're not able to hear me.
17294.0,Patient,I cannot hear you you're cutting off.
324.0,Provider,The safest medication that I would recommend right now would be the abuse bar that we talked about earlier. Because it is a category B medication. is still safer. than what you're taking now.
