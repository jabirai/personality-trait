This is what I will tell you this, what I would suggest you to do right what I will tell you to do is they either get to an end of it out like when you when you turn into an hour and you see so many people there. My thing is is you can either have two options. You can either pull off to the side. And just kind of do some sales town. kind of talk yourself down.

740.0,Provider,"Mike and that's how I work and because my thing is, I see if there are resources to actually help you. and say, I know that your goal is to get off the medication, and so one of the things that I will say is that we have to be able to identify natural remedies that you can use so that you don't go into full blown panic over small things right, because if.

Okay, and so i'm going to go through my list i'm going to take my pain and i'm going to check off everything on my list. Before I head to the register i'm going to reject my list again before I hate to the register, so I can make sure I don't forget anything.
