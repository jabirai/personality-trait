I was able to one of my goals this vacation was to wash all the laundry and get it all put away and in total during this vacation I washed. I separate I went to the basement I separated everybody's laundry by person. Well then, that's a good way to do it, you know. yeah so it it, it was smaller loads so it took longer for me to do, but I was able to wash dry and fold everybody's laundry by the person. So I did everybody, so I did seven loads of people laundry and then a yeah and then on two loads of towels socks and underwear. So yeah so all together that's like nine loads of laundry I did, and they were like a lot of laundry so. wash dried and put away and loads of laundry and I got my room clean.
