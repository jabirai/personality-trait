480.0,Provider,Hello. Good what's new anything.
8045.0,Patient,"uh well just kind of waiting for the Court date on Thursday and i'm waiting to hear back for the other court date, so the one on Thursday is just the progress report, so I mean other than picking up my progress report tomorrow, there is should be nothing much to it. Other court date is basically to see if the. Child services case is closed."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah do you have a date for that one yet or no.
8045.0,Patient,The lawyer supposed to get back to me about that so that's why i'm waiting for his response.
480.0,Provider,"cool well that's exciting. And you're not super nervous about Thursday, because it should be pretty easy."
8045.0,Patient,"i'm always a little bit nervous but it's just kind of like. I worry too much. it's like Okay, I hope, nothing unusual happens I don't think anything, well, I hope, nothing unusual happens."
480.0,Provider,"So and you're overthinking mode, what have you. It for seeing could possibly happen."
8045.0,Patient,"uh. Basically, the judge changing his mind or the. Prosecution asking for something extra or something like that I don't know. Okay, I don't know how likely, that is to happen, but it's kind of like yeah I try to prepare myself mentally in case it does."
480.0,Provider,"Which is not a terrible thing actually knowing like worst case scenario, can be feel like a safety net yeah."
8045.0,Patient,"And so it's just a matter of. Making sure I don't think too much about it yeah yeah. yeah I mean for the most part that's pretty much it, I mean other than that. Today i've been a little bit more. No one calling, I guess, just because, like. I. I saw my kid sister day. And not like Logan got bored towards the end of it. Like the first I thought they had suggested paddleboarding or pedal boating. But I guess that was the their moms idea and so after like about 20 minutes out in the sun on the water. They weren't as into it and so. Well that's Okay, I mean it's just that. I would have wanted them to enjoy themselves more."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
8045.0,Patient,"So yeah I told him, you all, next time, if she suggests something, and you guys aren't sure just let me know we'll just go do something else."
480.0,Provider,So. Do you think they were receptive of that like do you think they would actually do that.
8045.0,Patient,I don't know. um I hope they would.
480.0,Provider,uh huh.
8045.0,Patient,But at least it kind of gives me an idea of the kind of things that they might not want to do as much.
480.0,Provider,"yeah yeah makes sense, so I have never heard of paddle boating there's paddleboarding. what's the difference."
8045.0,Patient,"Oh, I mean. Maybe it's pedal one boating I don't know but it's kind of like they attach the propellers to like bicycle pedals."
480.0,Provider,"Oh yeah oh yeah i've done that, before I just didn't know what it was called okay yeah."
8045.0,Patient,I mean it's not the kind of thing I would go out and do on my own because it's like oh that sounds like a lot of work.
480.0,Provider,It is a lot of work i've done it before.
8045.0,Patient,"And I don't feel like pulling in the water, so yeah it's not the usual kind of thing to do, but it's like I mean I thought, if they wanted to do it then yeah no problem, but it's like oh you guys didn't want to do it, she told me I didn't want to go."
480.0,Provider,hey yeah oh bummer.
8045.0,Patient,"So yeah no it's gonna like thinking Oh, I hope, like you know I hope the next time we do something they'll have a bit more fun. yeah so yeah that's something that's been on my mind."
480.0,Provider,Do you feel responsible in a way. To make sure they have fun.
8045.0,Patient,"I feel responsible for creating the opportunity for them to have fun. And so it's kind of like it felt a little bit like Oh, why didn't do as much as I could have, if I have number."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, and also you didn't know when there was no way for you. to know yeah there's no way to like prevent that from happening."
8045.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean that that's something that, like, I know I have to kind of work on like if I there's no way I could have no maybe I need to just let it go. yeah yeah that was that was one of the bigger challenges, when I was very awesome so."
480.0,Provider,Just letting things go.
8045.0,Patient,"Well, just letting go of the things that I couldn't have known about like dealing with that better."
480.0,Provider,"hmm. So now, where do you feel like you are on that process like are you able to let things go when you realize that you had no control over the outcome."
8045.0,Patient,not quite yet i'm still trying to work on just.
480.0,Provider,recognizing that what do you think it would take to get to that point. yeah.
8045.0,Patient,Just like with a lot of other stuff it's like. I need opportunities to practice. yeah I gotta beat myself over the head with it until I kind of gets sick and tired of that and then it's like then gradually i'll be able to do.
480.0,Provider,That make sense yeah for sure. What when you say you're feeling melancholy like what's different today versus a normal day feelings wise.
8045.0,Patient,it's just a sense. You know. That I wish just today could have gone better accompanied by a. bit of a tightness in my chest every time I think about that. yeah yeah I mean it took me most of yesterday and part of that this morning to kind of figure out why it was that I was kind of off.
480.0,Provider,When did you realize that.
8045.0,Patient,"Well, as soon as they took off it's like. You know, like I I. I don't feel like that sense of. contentment that I usually have after spending some time with the kids."
480.0,Provider,"And you think it was directly tied to their emotional state, not necessarily anything on your end."
8045.0,Patient,yeah I mean specifically was tied to Logan. You know kind of getting bored and. yeah that's pretty much it.
480.0,Provider,"yeah okay. So going forward the rest of the week. Realistically, do you think it's possible to kind of like put this situation in an imaginary box close it up and not revisit it. Or is it something you're going to be thinking about all week."
8045.0,Patient,um I will be trying to put it in that imaginary box I don't think not thinking about it is. it's likely like i'll go back and revisit it. On occasion kind of like take it out of the box and then examine it a bit and then put it back in the box. mm hmm and i'll probably do that a few times. For a while i'm not sure how long.
480.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. So pay attention to how many times you revisit it i'd be curious to know, because that's part of. Changing behavior right is the awareness of knowing how often it occurs and what's triggering that yeah so if there's something directly. Before you go revisit the situation, then you know that that's a trader, whether it be like a work stress, or like I don't know seeing a picture of the kids or something that triggers you to go revisit that. Or do you already know your triggers."
8045.0,Patient,um I don't know my triggers I know I would do that once in a while when i'm just sitting around or when a free moment from my mind to wonder yeah.
480.0,Provider,boredom is the trigger. Like idol being idols to trigger.
8045.0,Patient,yeah being idle can be a trigger yes.
480.0,Provider,yeah okay.
8045.0,Patient,"So, like all the people telling me too oh let's just take a break relax don't think about things it's like yeah sometimes that's The worst thing I can do."
480.0,Provider,yeah. Exactly because you're not taking a mental break you're taking physical break yeah but then that increases the mental. Oh space exhaustion hamster wheel whatever you want to call it.
8045.0,Patient,yeah pretty much.
480.0,Provider,"So last time we were talking and came up this idea that like you can never be happy. You don't believe that's possible for you to actually be happy. given your worldview and perspective on things so i'm wondering how this correlates then, because if you don't think it's possible for you to feel happiness or be happy, then. How do you translate that to your kids experiences because you're expecting they're gonna have fun and be happy when they're with you."
8045.0,Patient,I don't want them to be like me.
480.0,Provider,Oh interesting okay.
8045.0,Patient,I think.
480.0,Provider,"Because if they're like you, what would that mean."
8045.0,Patient,"They probably won't be I don't want them to go this goes through the same kind of misery that I do, I like them to be able to achieve success without that kind of stuff that I do. So it kinda like how I tried to not be like my parents, by improving on the things that they didn't do as well, I hope they do the same with me."
480.0,Provider,Okay.
8045.0,Patient,"So yeah I mean some of the stuff like I don't talk like specifically about depression or anything like that. But like i'll I will mention stuff like that, where it's like yeah the kind of stuff i'm telling you it's what I found works for me, but that doesn't mean it's a good solution. So I hope they don't just take my word or anyone else's word for it like they go and figure like if they think of something that might be better I hope they try it."
480.0,Provider,That makes sense. You said normally when you leave spending time with your kids you feel content does content equal happy in your mind.
8045.0,Patient,"yeah to some extent, I mean it's, not that I never feel happy it's more like. I have brief moments feeling happy and then I have to work for the next moment."
480.0,Provider,"So. The the state of being happy, is something that requires a lot of effort on your it. Yes, like it doesn't just come naturally you don't. ever imagine. You having like so a lot of people will say i'm generally. happy. and I have these stressful things going on, so your perspective would be i'm rarely happy, but occasionally it's possible yeah."
8045.0,Patient,"I mean yeah I met the people who are generally happy and they are a mystery to me. And I would ask them Okay, so what are you happy about it's like. Oh i'm just happy it's like oh yeah i'll know what that's like. So yeah it's like work for something and then you. Like there's some. Completion to it, or something with it, that I am that I am satisfied with and like i'll have the the."
480.0,Provider,So satisfaction is a big part of happiness for you.
8045.0,Patient,Part of it yeah.
480.0,Provider,"That makes sense because, like we've talked about before you're very outcome oriented."
8045.0,Patient,"Yes, yes I."
480.0,Provider,"know if something is successful, then that equates to happy like i'm Okay, because this thing was successful."
8045.0,Patient,yeah and. i'm the happiest when it's not just successful but is.
480.0,Provider,"It exceeds expectations, yes okay. hmm so translating that to time with your kids then if let's say you had this experience yesterday and they had been overjoyed like oh my gosh having so much fun. You would have left feeling happy."
8045.0,Patient,"yeah it's like oh I didn't want to go paddleboarding and whatever but it's like. You know what they really get a kick out of it, and it was all worth it yeah so and I would I would feel pretty happy with it."
480.0,Provider,i'm wondering if there's moments when you were paddleboarding with them of happiness or joy and if you can even remember or access them.
8045.0,Patient,"um. Their brief moments I guess the one that immediately comes to mind where that there were some geese and some duck swimming around we went to. cornell the park in San demas and so there's some you know, birds and stuff like that there and so it's like okay let's see if we can hit the ducks. So that's, like the other thing I tend to do, which is like. That one it's kind of like I knew we weren't going to be the ducks ducks were really that easy to go after like they would have gone extinct like I guess so it's like just the ludicrous thought is is is enjoyable to me."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and it almost sounds like having an element of competition helps to bring joy because a lot of the things you enjoy seem to have some element of competition or. A challenge."
8045.0,Patient,yeah yeah and. measurable results.
480.0,Provider,"Yes, measurable results is important yeah. Okay. hmm okay that makes a lot of sense So then, because with measurable results, because the kids weren't like overjoyed at the end of the day, that's what left you feeling pretty melancholy."
8045.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it wasn't even that they weren't overjoyed it's kind of like we're kind of done with this. So I mean another example is I count my I helped my mom buy a new phone and so, along with it, I got them the chromecast and like for me it's just like oh yeah This is like a useful thing to have if you if you have an android phone like. It makes doing certain things a whole lot easier and then after I set it up for my dad and I showed him how to use it, like the next time I went to visit he's like yeah, this is probably the greatest invention over me. yeah that was unexpected but. All right, that's fantastic."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, so other people feeling joy brings you joy yeah. Okay. So that's interesting because I would not have pegged you as a codependent type but that's like in essence codependency is caring about other people's feelings more than your out. yeah yeah."
8045.0,Patient,"yeah one my parenting class was a parenting or anger management, one of those be the kind of handed out some worksheets and kind of pointed that out to me."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah was that surprising to you to.
8045.0,Patient,it's more like I wouldn't have thought. I was some of those codependent but reading like their description and the way they explain it it's like oh yeah why I guess I am. yeah I never really thought about this.
480.0,Provider,"yeah which is interesting because a lot of people think codependency means you always want to be with somebody or people and that's not at all what it means is exactly what we said earlier it's like making sure other people's needs are met before your oh. yeah which is interesting because growing up in the society we grew up in it's kind of like that's the goal right there kind of preaching that that's how it should be, you should care about people more than yourself yeah."
8045.0,Patient,I hate that.
480.0,Provider,i'm exactly exactly.
8045.0,Patient,"Like I always feel like that's probably the reason why the world is in such a horrible state. You know lights from everything from you know climate change to people not wanting to wear masks or get vaccination shots and stuff like that. it's like all right, you know what you want to take that risk I don't, mind you go for it, but then you can't take the risk for all these other people around like you can't make that decision."
480.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. huh. interesting. Okay, so, then, here is my question and for you, it with the codependency thing in mind is do you even know what your needs are that you should be meeting before meeting other people."
8045.0,Patient,"Other than the. Other than the basic stuff like you know Do I need to stay alive. One of the exercises i've been asked to do by a lot of different people is to find hobbies and interests it's like. I mean that was fine hobbies and interests I can be passionate about like I think that's The key thing. Because like yeah I can find hobbies and interests it's like i'll just sit on my own goals and it's but then i'm like no just be passionate about it do it just because you want to do it, so I don't do that."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. Which is okay like I don't think that that's. A flaw that. You don't have hobbies that necessarily because, so what i'm hearing is for it to be a hobby for you, there has to be some sort of. Pride what am I trying to say like and game right so. Like it has to produce something that makes you feel good. Again, just be like i'm going to pay just to paint you have to like create something that feels valuable."
8045.0,Patient,"yeah. So it's like yeah like the hobby right now I guess the thing that comes closest is i'll watch like a documentaries and educational videos on YouTube and that the end of it, I don't expect to be an expert, but then it's like I getting a little bit more understanding something. yeah so yeah that sounds like."
480.0,Provider,that's a hobby. learning is a hobby. You have one. well.
8045.0,Patient,"Well, like I said. it's not finding a hobby it's this idea of finding something that can be passionate about it's like Okay, I learned something that's that's."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, but. here's The thing is, do you have to necessarily find that passion and what does passion me because passion can be subjective. Right, and I think part of the problem is when we say be passionate about something in your mind you're picturing like i'm going to be super excited and all into it and i'm going to feel almost like a high from doing whatever it is i'm passionate about. that's. That is another one of society's kind of social constructs his passion doesn't have to be tied to emotion."
8045.0,Patient,"Can I borrow you and, like tell other people. cuz I don't think they believe I see it."
480.0,Provider,"Like so I. Stand more from a personal I i've been in places in my life, where I felt like I don't have any passion for anything and I had to redefine what that meant because my idea of passion. used to be emotional excitement engagement like strong emotions towards something now I see passion is completely differently passion to me, is something that fulfills me. that's what passion means so working I know you've said this before my work is my passion. And a lot of people don't like that, but it is because helping people is what i'm passionate about connecting with people is what i'm passionate about. It doesn't mean when i'm sitting here on the computer i'm feeling like an emotionally intense high from that passion. But overall big picture that's what my passion and drive is is connecting with people, and I have people I connect with that I don't feel that with but that doesn't negate the fact that, like that, so my passion."
8045.0,Patient,You know what I mean.
480.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think that's something that's been really helpful for me and my healing journey is just redefining some of these like terms that people throw around a lot. because the problem is if i'm somebody who lacks passion, as the social construct then i'm going to feel like there's something wrong with me i'm inadequate i'm not valuable because I don't. feel the thing that everyone else feels but that's The difference is I don't know that other people that say they're passionate about like someone that's passionate about music I there's no. knowing whether or not they feel that intense emotional high when they're playing music, it could be more my definition, but nobody asks what your definition of passionate you know."
8045.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I enjoy. Learning things just because, like the excitement doesn't come from learning it that excitement comes like from the fact that I learned that because I think there's something useful to it, and then, when I finally find a use for it then that's usually, when i'm excited. when no one wants to hear about it."
480.0,Provider,"Well then, that means those people are just the wrong audience for your passionate discovery."
8045.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah that that's why like I don't talk much. And then people think i'm very pleased and then, once they start talking it's like you know. Where that came from."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. hmm interesting so yeah I don't think your void of passion, I think that maybe your definition is different than people."
8045.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean it's something I was thinking about."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
8045.0,Patient,"yeah. One of the things from last time that we spoke, and I think I told you that I was going to be thinking about a life. I would like to apologize for. surprising you what's the way, I think. I was talking about that red button."
480.0,Provider,"For your thoughts, this is not Okay, you have no control over your thoughts."
8045.0,Patient,"Well, I mean it was like oh yeah yeah I I I gave her an example, maybe that wasn't the best idea. I mean the entire thing for me after I said and I thought about it was yeah the whole key to it was that it was a hypothetical situation. And, unlike most people who treat hypothetical situations as they're both going to be real like if they're really dealing with it for me it's like oh hypothetical situation perfect I can do whatever I want and there's absolutely no consequences, so let me think of the. Like before, like most like let me push push that envelope, as far as like can."
480.0,Provider,"I get it, and I did not judge you or think anything different because of it, I promise like that is 100% honesty I didn't even. Think about it after the session because to me that's not alarming that's not a big deal I just I get it, I understand that that's you have a good imagination so part of that is. Your imagination at play right which is a good thing, because, like we were talking about in group the survival brain versus learning brain. survival brain you can't access that kind of imagination so somebody that's able to create those extreme hypotheticals that's not a bad thing, in my mind."
8045.0,Patient,Would you like to be my boss to bed.
480.0,Provider,What did you say to your boss.
8045.0,Patient,"Well, no, I mean it's just like. A vault office i've had, I mean the one I have right now is. pretty good all the past, while since i've had like I love the fact that in job interviews, especially back in the late 90s and early 2000s, the big in thing was looking for people who think outside the box. Yes, and the thing I learned from all those interviews and all that stuff is when they say they want to look for people who think outside the box. they're actually saying we want to look for people who say they think they are they think outside the box, but actually agrees with me, so I can feel like I think outside of the box. Yes, when I actually think outside the box everyone tends to be tends to be very unhappy."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
8045.0,Patient,Because you.
480.0,Provider,"Know then that's so true because, like you said people's idea of what's out of the box like there's a limit to their open mindedness right so it's like I want you to think outside the box, but I still want it to fit into my close minded view of how people should think or B hey yeah."
8045.0,Patient,"Maybe like a better way of putting it is think outside of someone else's box, but thinking outside of my box."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, or you can think outside of my box, as long as it's imaginable, and appropriate to me. yeah it's my worldview yeah."
8045.0,Patient,"So yeah i've gotten myself in not in trouble, but. um i've gotten a lot of raised eyebrows."
480.0,Provider,yeah we've gotten some extra attention.
8045.0,Patient,"Oh, you don't actually want me to think outside the box okay all right."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
8045.0,Patient,i'll save it for like. quite a long time me moments.
480.0,Provider,For therapy.
8045.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I even worry about that with therapy. Like you know we talked about the idea of codependency being like trump wanting to please someone else like I mean if, like being very honest like I I do that with YouTube."
480.0,Provider,Like yeah.
8045.0,Patient,"I want to make sure that you feel like you're not wasting your time with me that i'm you know i'm actively participating and all that stuff now whether it's like one on one like this, or like in the group sessions so like that becomes really important to me."
480.0,Provider,"hmm. that's something we should work on them is how do we. How do we disengage from that need to please people and just be yourself, because the only way. The only way to get to a point of not necessarily needing to please people is to understand that people are still going to think the same and respect you the same if you're unfiltered and raw which takes exposure and practice right yeah so like. I would suggest in your you know downtime when your brain likes to overthink thinking about what it is that the people pleasing is. Doing as far as keeping you safe. Because that's a need is for like safety and to be accepted accepted so. Where what's that element and what happens if it goes away."
8045.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I don't know what this is all because i'm still thinking about it, like constantly too, but I know a big part of it is like like even when I just see something group, and it seems like you know it's something that people are receptive to. No matter how much it helps or not. like that, like that is actually my main source of happiness."
480.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
8045.0,Patient,"Okay, like I, and I mean it's not even, just like in group, like even with my friends and stuff like that it's like. Oh, like I I did something whether it was the job or said something or whatever, and I see that it made them happy or made like it helped them same with my kids definitely with work it's like oh like watching. it's knowing that, like my efforts like. Help someone or meet them happier. yeah like that's like that is that means a lot to me."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, that makes sense that makes a lot of sense so, then the. The next question would be. If. You say things and people don't respond in a positive way. What does that do to your sense of self."
8045.0,Patient,"A time to go back and reevaluate think about how I could have. Like if there's something I could have said differently or set thought some thought of something differently to say. Sometimes there is a sense of inadequacy. Where it's like oh I couldn't I couldn't think of something to say like like my kryptonite, if you will, in those situations would be like if someone has a loss like. Like they lose a family member or something like that it's like. Like that's one of the situations where I I don't deal with very well. And it just always feels like anything I try and say or do it just feels very inadequate. yeah yeah and."
480.0,Provider,that's everyone dealing with that. Situation nobody knows what to say oh.
8045.0,Patient,"Well, and like my expectation for myself is I need to figure out what I can see what I can do. Okay yeah and then there's the one more for it's like I see or do something and they're actively upset. And that's easy when I. yeah and I beat myself up. yeah, with the exception of where I think they're being unreasonable and then I just get annoyed and upset with them."
480.0,Provider,"Well, so I think part of this is knowing that, and this is part of the codependency work, knowing that other people bring a whole bunch of triggers and experiences to your presence right. So, like let's say we're friends and we're meeting for coffee and you say something that upsets me there's a good possibility that i'm not upset because of you i'm upset because it triggered something that has nothing to do with you."
8045.0,Patient,"And like like intellectually, I know that, like but emotionally like. Like. Like yeah it's almost like I need some reassurance, but then, because the person is going through those emotions like I can't get it from them. So it's kind of like I did something and then my friends upset or my wife ex wife said it's like oh wasn't me it wasn't me it's like yeah and that's usually, when they get mad at me he's like look it's not always about me alone it's like I just need to know is the me."
480.0,Provider,Right yeah. So that's where you have to continuously remind yourself that's probably not you know it's just hard to do in the moment because it feels like it is you.
8045.0,Patient,"Well it's hard to do for me in the moment just because it's like actually in my back in my head it's like yeah But what if this is what this time is the exception, what if it really wasn't me this time and that's when I start freaking myself out."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense. So I do have to wrap up because I have someone else in the waiting room. Sure, do you want to schedule another session for October, do you want to wait till November, what do you think."
8045.0,Patient,"Either either way works for me. i'll see on a more selfish level, I always enjoy speaking with you. But like I think like that's. Different from like you know I keep doing the treatment and the third yeah."
480.0,Provider,yeah So what if we do. How early is too early for you remind me it's eight o'clock to early.
8045.0,Patient,Know eight o'clock is fine.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I have an eight o'clock on Monday, the 18th we can do, maybe two weeks. Sure okay let's do that, and then, if you don't mind I will actually schedule a year November. Do you want to do, eight or nine."
8045.0,Patient,I think either one would work for me.
