15239.0,Patient,Christmas.
462.0,Provider,you're. Sick do you have. God.
15239.0,Patient,I was excited about it and then my mom happy.
462.0,Provider,hmm what happened.
15239.0,Patient,"And just the preparations for. and is usually more prepared, and that is being a last minute rapper. And stress is already rubbing off on me. And the last couple weeks have already been hard. On my health. haven't been getting enough sleep he's. just been bad."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so stresses hi mom stresses hi it's rubbing off on you, impacting your physical health you're lacking sleep."
15239.0,Patient,"yeah. I miss the group yesterday because I was just sitting it make it or could they be zoning out and. I am I had food allergies, for a long time pretty severe was. I mean not like life threatening or anything but. They thought they were back and ate something that I just. know that that thing that gets to. sit there. With their arms crossed, and they have their heads back and they just kind of not off her. i'm not saying. That they're sleeping. They think that's kind of what happened, I miss group yesterday."
462.0,Provider,Okay.
15239.0,Patient,cuz I just can't stay awake.
462.0,Provider,Right that's a bit of a sign there for you that. overwhelmed too much.
15239.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay, can I ask what the topic was yesterday."
462.0,Provider,So the topic yesterday was actually just checking in about Christmas stress. So. So here we are.
15239.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah and I can tell you that you're not alone right now that there's a lot of people that are experiencing heightened stress levels, right now, because of the holidays and because of family members and. Something that you, you know or that we've been talking about is just this codependency with your mom so part of codependency is when. One person stress goes up that means yours automatically goes up and that's that's one of the most painful parts of codependency is because it's like another person is controlling your. feelings and your state of well being so, how do you think you can try to separate from that stress right now."
15239.0,Patient,I did a couple things he suggested I got. Somehow I managed to get to. dress. The package and I got a fun button up shirt actually for Christmas.
462.0,Provider,"whoa alright so that's two goals that we talked about exactly one was the poster and also using that poster not only to clean your own independent space, but to kind of. relate to and get a little bit of encouragement and strength from by looking at it so that's good and then you picked a shirt that you feel. Connected to and like you can express yourself to the world for. In a more authentic way rather than kind of wearing things that your mom wants you to right so that's great Those are two steps in the right direction. How about just things you can do to reduce your stress levels and get some sleep right now."
15239.0,Patient,"I think. I take so many pills, every day, I think I. going to stop taking one because it was making my stomach upset. And for some reason. it's pretty easy for me. To get knocked out with sleeping pills so i've been taking them for a long time and they've kind of stopped taking them it kind of makes me nervous. A dependent on them. So I stopped taking them. Know reading makes me sleepy."
462.0,Provider,So maybe picking up a book trying to get in bed early tonight and pick up a book to help you kind of doze off.
15239.0,Patient,"I need a story, though."
462.0,Provider,You don't have one right now.
15239.0,Patient,"So much I have more. Like information books. And that just just make a pre wire, you know."
462.0,Provider,Just yeah right yeah you need more of something relaxing there's there's a podcast to called a something sleepy time stories or bedtime stories or something where they tell stories in a way that's supposed to help you kind of go to sleep.
15239.0,Patient,and
462.0,Provider,Something to try to yeah. So how do you see yourself getting through this holiday and moving forward today.
15239.0,Patient,"don't know she just called me so. i've been. I didn't tell her what kind of outfit because I know she wants me to wear something sparkly and girly so i'm going to kind of hide it until we get there, I know she's gonna be like. You know. Show to spit at me the whole time. So i've been kind of looking for cargo pants he's helping me by cargo pants and. he's good about that she's good at trying to help me get what i've been trying to do. Other than that, just trying to get the House ready. I have it packed yet we're leaving Saturday. Which is a lot of time. So the Wednesday. mentally I don't. do well, living in the same space. Because, yesterday we were out there, you know. you'd like to feed the chickens together, you know it's a good bad relaxing day it was garbage days so she likes to come and kind of nitpick you know outside my room sake just has this look on her face and it just immediately said to me to being 10 years old. This, for me, part. So that just. Sit down. Yes, this is still treat me like a little girl. In those moments I just kind of. sink inside myself. This is."
462.0,Provider,You think would be an alternative reaction.
15239.0,Patient,I don't know Sometimes I get annoyed and she just snaps right back at me. know she just. Really doesn't care which you hurts my feelings. SIS really abrasive. supposed to a degree in my. younger days. because she could just never be wrong. Those parents who think that she shouldn't have to apologize her kids.
462.0,Provider,"kind of this ongoing pain for you really of being in this codependent relationship with your mother and like you said you're still treated as a child and it kind of flashes you back to being a child. So there's gotta be some way to build some emotional boundaries and barriers, maybe you can't physically separate you know you want to. Stay stay living there, but how do you think you can start building some emotional boundaries some emotional barriers so that you don't have to be constantly connected and hurt by this."
15239.0,Patient,They always say hurt people hurt people. easy target. asking myself that.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you feel like you're an easy target, but you don't have to be right, you can change it might not be easy, but you don't have to be stuck in this easy target position so. You know this can be kind of the broader question, right now, how can you step away from you know just kind of being the easy target or the victim and and build up a little bit of barriers and separate from this relationship. You know, whether it be on a day to day basis just kind of doing your own thing taking a step back from communicating calling texting. What have you. Are there were times, where you feel like you, are communicating and you don't need to be."
15239.0,Patient,Do text but it's supposed to be about how stuff. let's see about the animals in the House. Nothing really person.
462.0,Provider,When where does the attachment live for you.
15239.0,Patient,guess just the hope that i'll give.
462.0,Provider,And what's about.
15239.0,Patient,Close this close this. word is pronounced.
462.0,Provider,"So closeness that's something that you're the that's leaving you attached, there is just wanting to find and feel that closeness so. How do you think you can find that closeness and other ways, whether it be giving it to yourself or meeting new people creating new relationships that sort of thing."
15239.0,Patient,"This is just not the same miniature moon. Like it's going to be one of those things that happens, because it has. just said."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. Another thing that's helpful for a lot of people is a technique and process called re parenting so it's the idea of you re parenting yourself in a way that you never got. From your own parents, so it can start by you just finding a picture of yourself, when you were a kid and kind of taking some time to look at it and. start to think about yourself. As that kid not in a way that you regress back to acting like a child, but in a way that you affirm yourself right like oh what I ever treated child like this talk to. My little self like this right and just kind of reflect on that child that is within you and is within all of us, does that sound like something you could do, or that would be helpful for you."
15239.0,Patient,yeah I kind of did that. I was in a co a adult children of alcoholics. So it will pick I Eric I never went to a face to face meeting because they're kind of hard to find. kind of online meetings. it's kind of hard to work two steps i've never got a sponsor or anything but okay it didn't help a lot.
462.0,Provider,yeah so. How do you think you can continue that process of re parenting.
15239.0,Patient,Do what you suggested.
462.0,Provider,"So do that and then everything to can be just giving yourself like playtime again not doing that, as a child, but. or playing video games, I know you like to do that sometimes they're going outside going to a park walking around the park even swinging on a swing for a second right. kind of allowing yourself to just be free, because it sounds like there's a lot of constrictions from your mom and that she doesn't want you to. dress a certain way express your gender identity right.dot.so that can be another thing too is to just give yourself this kind of free play time to go out and just kind of be be free have fun enjoy the moment give that to yourself, without criticism."
15239.0,Patient,"yeah. She bragged about. where she me to wear dresses. Be. Fighting with her, since I was two to wear overalls know like. As soon as I was big enough to realize it I could pick my own clothes."
462.0,Provider,yeah and that's a another way to repair it and you're already doing it is by buying cargo pants in the shirt that you want things that you feel express your own individuality.
15239.0,Patient,didn't realize that she just keeps insisting.
462.0,Provider,"yeah and she may keep insisting forever, but it's a matter of again stepping away from that and affirming yourself."
15239.0,Patient,yeah i've known for a long time that this is. Who I am and what I would. not say. hear stories about people all the time coming out anyway. I see how they won riding with their parents God so brave.
462.0,Provider,what's your fear of what would happen.
15239.0,Patient,"I guess, this is that this. Because I know that. there's a lot of things that she doesn't like it. yeah she takes a while, for her to adjust and silly she it's over it."
462.0,Provider,yeah so. The disapproval that you're fearing it's more of an emotional lack of safety than the physical lack of safety in this circumstance.
15239.0,Patient,anywhere else to go.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so fear of losing your your home or your physical space."
15239.0,Patient,"yeah. I love California, but it's too expensive."
462.0,Provider,That it is.
15239.0,Patient,Really don't believe that I could make it on my own. 25 years.
462.0,Provider,So what changed.
15239.0,Patient,"Like I had tried so many things. failure. stuff tonight I. Barely graduated high school, I went to three different high schools, I finally graduated. They try college so many times so. Why bother trying again."
462.0,Provider,"So you've been kind of beaten down by all these experiences and perceived failures and probably led you, you know further and further even into this codependent relationship and this fear of disapproval and of losing your living space."
15239.0,Patient,"yeah the only person in my family doesn't have a college degree. and watch my mom go to college for 12 years. Everyone else is going back to college my cousin is good me. I don't know what the degree is but she's gonna get something and become a professor. Just feels great. Other uncle my. that lives up in napa you didn't go to college, but. You kind of works at home too young to both storage and. He didn't start working he kind of left with his mom until he was like 40. And that's that's why I liked him, he was kind of a homebody like me. Seemingly didn't do much. He was a coolest person ever."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so this kind of just connects back to. This other expectation like there's almost probably your mom's expectations of what's successful versus not successful and viewing yourself is failing but. there's a perfect example of the person you just described it's like such a great person, but had all these perceived failures, but who use these are who's creating this standard in your mind."
15239.0,Patient,"So, so my uncle know those kind of Christmas. Those family newsletters you get pictures of people, it says so, and so is doing this, and so it's. just got one yesterday. about my cousin going back to college my. aunt son goes back to college and even the three year old they're bragging about how smart she is."
462.0,Provider,So there's this standard that you're comparing yourself to.
15239.0,Patient,"Yes, kind of expected I guess. It was like you."
462.0,Provider,"know. So just kind of looping back around at one point, we talked about your values and you may be creating a value list were you ever able to get to that."
15239.0,Patient,"Yes, I kind of know in my heart. I just. I played I know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so diving into your own values could be a good start here, going back to that assignment of creating a written values list right like you're trying to live up to these values of your family of your mom but. That doesn't have to be the standard, you can create your own standard of what success and being a you know aligned person looks like. That doesn't have to include a degree."
15239.0,Patient,i'm sure no one else in my family can put up with my mom for 25 years. 30 years.
462.0,Provider,heard a dog.
15239.0,Patient,too good Mike.
462.0,Provider,So. you're having a tough week it's understandable and even just the tough week is. relating to these bigger themes that we've been talking about the codependence living others values rather than your own So what can you do just today to kind of make yourself feel better maybe getting to bed early trying to read beforehand to fall asleep what else.
15239.0,Patient,Is such a silly movie.
462.0,Provider,that's a great idea.
15239.0,Patient,At least silly I still watch pee wee's playhouse is it good.
462.0,Provider,To. be true yeah so that's a good good start and then you're leaving in on Saturday So where are you going and are you excited for this trip.
15239.0,Patient,yeah actually I am that's why it was such a bummer. Because yesterday I was all buzzed about it and then just went to the toilet and going to bakersfield fortunately. Out of four hour trip. And just going until Saturday morning because we have all these animals. In. kind of expected to be fun.
462.0,Provider,And you can let yourself enjoy that and he said you're going to kind of step outside your comfort zone and wear what you want.
15239.0,Patient,yeah good yeah I need to be in layers anyway because it's so damn cold here.
462.0,Provider,Good. So if the disapproval pops up. What can you do with it.
15239.0,Patient,"And well I know my uncle the like it, because it's it's a hawaiian shirt and it's got a Santa on it did you surfing. Very cute. So I see your shirt but i'm getting another one. Okay."
462.0,Provider,Let other people enjoy it How else can you try to work through the disapproval that might come up.
15239.0,Patient,But I like it.
462.0,Provider,"Good bring it back around. I like it, I like this, I feel good wearing this it doesn't matter if she feels good or bad habit you wear this I feel good wearing this right affirm yourself yeah."
15239.0,Patient,Just assert it's not a car to chat to you. Thank you.
462.0,Provider,So you've got some some ideas and stuff to can you continue working on what would you describe as your current goals for your treatment plan.
15239.0,Patient,be nice to be something better than just surviving. you're surviving or something like that.
462.0,Provider,"So, to be beyond surviving and what do you. What do you think will help you get there."
15239.0,Patient,I just need a were simpler. To this.
462.0,Provider,"So finding a way to more than survive and doing that, by finding more support. Definitely that's a good start where any ideas on where to find more support."
15239.0,Patient,up next if there is work groups out there.
462.0,Provider,hmm so maybe looking into if there's any more groups or in person support groups or anything like that.
15239.0,Patient,"and it's not really related, but I am still actively looking for a steady. pronouncing it right Judaism."
462.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
15239.0,Patient,And and. enjoy the Facebook group of course and. There is a. rabbi a guess it's a progressive one because it's a woman. And she's going to be teaching. classes on zoom.
462.0,Provider,"Well there's a great way to find more support and connection. Right, so that can be your working goal to more than survive do that by finding more support. Our group other support groups, as well as joining the sessions, with the rabbi. Okay anything else that's come up for you Jesse that you'd like to either process today asked me or add to your goals treatment plan."
15239.0,Patient,Right right yeah because it hours.
462.0,Provider,yeah that's okay we've processed through quite a bit so that might be a good place to leave it so then how about we schedule you for next month.
15239.0,Patient,"Next year, hopefully."
462.0,Provider,"Next year, yes. Are you available. On Wednesday, the 20th."
15239.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"And do you want to go for. 1:30pm would that work for you. Okay, so 130 on the 12th next year. We just add that one and we'll get a second one. And then. Do you want to get also in for the 26. let's see so that 1pm is taken are you available at 10am. So put you in for that, and then, if you feel like you need more support we can always schedule for that Wednesday in between, but we'll get these two in for sure now and kind of touch base with them."
15239.0,Patient,"So is there going to be breaks. Are the groups or anything, because if they."
462.0,Provider,"know because our group falls on a Tuesday we should be just rolling through each week it's not on any of the actual holidays, so we should be good. Of course, if you're going to be out of town and you can't make it to group. You can always let someone know that would be me show and tell or calling the virtual clinic. That you're canceling and because you're going to be, you know, out of town for the holidays or whatever, although being out of town, you can always just join from your phone in a private location."
15239.0,Patient,I see.
462.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, Jesse well yeah that's you're doing really good work it's hard stuff to really confront codependency and long lasting. cycles and patterns so make sure you're just taking care of yourself to getting your sleep getting your rest getting out with your chickens and nurturing yourself in this time. Alright well have an awesome Christmas holiday enjoy your trip and I will see you in group."
15239.0,Patient,yeah sure your Christmas to.
462.0,Provider,"Thank you take care, see you next time. bye. Okay, in the plan section of this patients note. First of all, actually there pronouns are they slash them, so if you could use that instead of she and her in their note. That would be great and then also in their treatment plan section, if you could write what they said as their goal, which was to more than survive and do that by building more support. joining our group joining other groups and getting on sessions, with a rabbi and their goal section Thank you so much."
