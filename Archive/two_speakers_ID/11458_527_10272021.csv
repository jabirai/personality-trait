527.0,Provider,hi this is Andrea it's an individual session for kiersten Malaysia. hey justin how are you yeah.
11458.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
527.0,Provider,i'm doing good doing good just finished up a group so. Oh exciting. How are you doing.
11458.0,Patient,i'm good I feel good.
527.0,Provider,Okay well well tell me tell me what all is going well.
11458.0,Patient,"um I just generally still feel good I think it's like we've already. talked about the adderall has been helping a lot um, although I did hit a little bit of a speed bump because I misread my prescription a couple weeks ago and didn't realize it was shorter than it was so I ran out like a couple days ago, but I have it again now so it's fine but. It was like a slightly stressful situation. Because I was like oh shit I don't know what's happening um so that was a little a little rough because I realized how much it is helping when I didn't."
527.0,Provider,have it.
11458.0,Patient,Because.
527.0,Provider,I don't any withdrawal symptoms or side effects or anything.
11458.0,Patient,"No um I luckily realized, it was going to run out like with enough time. to sort of. Rational a little bit so that I didn't have to like abruptly stopped taking it because I. sure that that would be worse. than just taking a little bit less. So I it the it got really, really fast, like, I asked for it on Monday and shauntel got it sent to the pharmacy and I picked it up yesterday so. perfect, it was really fast um and that was good, so I don't have to worry about that now because. I got the prescription things sorted out, because I think I ended up in the yellow because it will take me forever to muster up the motivation and energy in general, like mental wherewithal to go get blood work done, because I hate it. So I finally got it done and it was more complicated than I ever could have imagined. I just always it's always such a freakin chore for me to go get blood work, because I have like. I don't know how to describe like complicated veins like like deep deep rolling veins."
527.0,Provider,So autumn.
11458.0,Patient,"Is tells me so like whenever they. try to find one they can find it and then it can move, and then, once in my arms are too far away or whatever the Fuck I don't know how this works. So they like have to always get it out of my hand and then that wasn't really. working so I almost was going to have to come back like a different day and i'm like I really don't want to do that because I work during the week and I don't. write this to keep impacting like my medication, so it was like this whole ball of anxiety luckily all of the people at the clinic were really, really nice, but I was like I, this is just remind me how much I hate having to do this. that's the worst it's been ever I think because usually they can at least find a vein in my hand or something and. Then they just take whatever they need, but I apparently needed so many tests that it was just like they needed so much that I was like okay yeah, this is the most I think i've ever had to get done at once. So it's like a whole thing and then I came home with like three bandages like three like very visible bandages on. This is the weirdest experience."
527.0,Provider,that's horrible.
11458.0,Patient,"curious yeah it was. It was fine afterwards, because I was like okay well it's done now, I don't have to go back like I have blood work that its current, for once, because it's probably been years since I last had to get my blood drawn for anything. I was just like what an experience and that's phlebotomists for like make sure you drink water, I was like i'm drinking so much water. Better."
527.0,Provider,Oh shoot.
11458.0,Patient,"yeah that was like the one the one bump that i've had in the last couple of weeks was doing that and then, in my infinite wisdom I scheduled a flu shot for right after that, because my grandma wanted us to get our flu shots and was. Really really on our asses about it so. I will go get my flu shot after I do this and then that was like, not even a little bit bad I just had to wait for a while, with some very chatty older ladies who really. annoyed that it was. And I was like Oh, this is really fine they're busy there's only like three people and they're like. says okay and flu shots are like not bad so."
527.0,Provider,Yes.
11458.0,Patient,It was like whatever. yeah that was like a whole day and I was like. Not enough adderall and then was getting poked and prodded by needle.
527.0,Provider,"I hope we went and did something fun for yourself, or when, God."
11458.0,Patient,"I mean either side, actually I got a milkshake after that, because I was like you know what I deserve this is gonna say no kidding I need to treat myself after the day I would do. yeah we ended up going to my grandma's after that and I just played video games with my brothers for a little while, and that was fun. So it wasn't a bad day it's like a combination of things that I don't like because i'm not like i'm not anxious about them, but I don't i'm not a huge fan of needles. yeah like or getting my blood drawn, although once the needles in there i'm like oh yeah This is fine and i'll like watch it because somehow that makes me feel less anxious about it, even though i'm like that's kind of morbid like it's kind of a weird urge to. watch it, but it ended up being fine and now I don't have to go back and do that anytime soon so."
527.0,Provider,Good yeah.
11458.0,Patient,"yeah that's been like the only speed bump and then i'm going to see my best friend this weekend which i'm very excited about so we haven't seen each other in a few months. Now that we will, because before, when I lived cuz he's from where I went to college So when I met him I was living up there, full time for school. So we have to hang out like all time sure. And then live together for a little while at one point, and so now being two hours apart is like a lot for us because we're like both aware of it, but like painfully counter. So i'm excited to go see him but deeply anxious and feeling weird about meeting his girlfriend even though she seems like. Extremely Nice. Okay. She seems really, really sweet and we already have things in common and i've talked to her a little bit already. But i'm just like. I think I feel less anxious about it now that i've like sat down and tried to like mentally walk through some of the weird things that I was anxious about in the first place."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11458.0,Patient,"Which is just like and i'm like i'm aware that it's like the level of codependency we have, we need to work through more. But, also, that. It is the codependency of it all that's like making me feel weird because i'm like oh this person is going to take come in and take him away from me, which is not what's happening. But has felt like it has happened before so i'm like I have like latency anxiety about it okay like even feeling that way, we still talk every single day like. We text each other talk on the phone every day and it's like even when we don't talk i'm like oh yeah he's just busy and i'm like doing my own thing so it's like not a huge deal. So it's like it only ever comes up and feels like an issue in situations like this where i'm like Okay, this is a new person in your life, who you clearly care about a lot and I want them to also like me because. You know we've been friends, for I guess comparatively in the Grand scheme of like a whole life, not that long, but like almost five years show. And we're like the kind of friends were like constantly joking that we're like basically the same person, because we have like so much in common, and like think the same way and, just like generally have very similar like upbringings in a lot of ways okay. So we're like really close so it's just like i'm not sure how to like tackle the level of anxiety, I have luckily, it has worn off and we talked about it a little bit today, even before therapy, because I know. But it's like i'm not i'm not really sure how to tackle that problem to the point where it gets more i'm like not anxious about it at all ever again because I don't think that's realistic for me like I can't control what i'm anxious about."
527.0,Provider,sure.
11458.0,Patient,"So it's sort of trying to get to the place where like I am aware that this is not actually a problem, and my anxiety is making it a bigger problem, but it needs to be okay."
527.0,Provider,So let's just talk about like. How so How did this How did this friendship develop then kiersten like how did you guys come to be friends and in where you're at now.
11458.0,Patient,i'm weirdly cool maybe not weirdly but I was living with. Some of my friends from college my first semester of Grad school and.
527.0,Provider,well.
11458.0,Patient,"My best friend happened to be sort of casually dating one of my roommates friends that I was living with. Okay, and so we met when he came over to pick up my roommate for a date and we met and hit it off because I was playing overwatch, which is the game that we both really liked at the time. So I was playing it, and so we like bonded immediately over this shared interest. And then, after a certain point, like probably not that long afterwards, like maybe a couple weeks afterwards, like we were texting, because I was trying to help him navigate like the complicated person that might."
527.0,Provider,enhance of.
11458.0,Patient,"dating so it was already like we hit it off very fast and i'm I like to think that i'm a very friendly person, so I like to hope and like really do hope not that hard to make friends with me so. um so we started talking more regularly pretty fast, and we have like a lot of the same. shared interests in like video games and movies and books and stuff so like. We bonded pretty quick which eventually became a weird point of contention for me and my roommate which was not so. Well that's what I was wondering like."
527.0,Provider,"Where there were there more intense feelings there, or are there more intense feelings there then and is that part of the issue."
11458.0,Patient,"It could be, because I have a tendency and I like recognize this in myself as a person that like anytime anybody is nice to me I have like in appropriately more than Platonic feelings for them so i'm just like. it's like such a weird anxiety response from I think like childhood from. being bullied as a kid to like latch onto people's super hard when they're like really nice to me, and also my partner, and I even though we've been dating for a decade or whenever we're caught Fuck me feel so old um but. i've been dating for almost 10 years but we're also like not functionally monogamous even though neither of us are dating other people right now. So it's, just like in my brain and I have talked to will about this for and we've like parse this out where we like really love each other, a ton and like maybe it's like more than Platonic on both of our parts, but it's not at a point where we would ever do anything about it. So it's just like you're my best friend and I really love you, but like that that's that's it so yeah I think that that's definitely where some of the like weird anxiety stems from. But I also don't know like it hasn't been like after we kind of talked it out and this usually tends to be the case that, once we can talk about something and really try to hash it out together, it becomes a non issue. At that point, and we have both had a lot of therapy, so it has it's not that hard for us. To communicate like whatever we're feeling in any situation. So it's yeah we have kind of an intense relationship just in terms of like how."
527.0,Provider,yeah how close we are and we've.
11458.0,Patient,"been friends through like probably some of the most mentally taxing and like really fucked up parts of my life as a person so like. My parents getting a divorce, which was really traumatic for me because they've been together my whole life up until that point even that was actually not a good relationship and my dad is like really not a spectacular human being. But so he was there for that and then after that I started to really have like some intense more intense than I had ever experienced before mental health problems, because that was. Around the time that it became clear that I I hadn't been I didn't get diagnosed until probably like a year after or maybe like within a few like six months to a year after my parents got divorced, but like obviously i'm bipolar so like the. process of getting that diagnosis was like a lot of. Really fucking terrible. untreated mental health issues that I was having and like show, he was there for all of that, like took me to the er a couple times when I was having like really bad recital ideation and like really helped me process. A lot of that stuff and like get through a lot of those situations so like For those reasons, also, we have a really intense relationship because, like we are. A big part of each other support systems in a lot of ways. So it's like. I guess, if I had to like really sit down and think about it, I guess it's part of me is scared that like if somebody takes them away, then I don't have that support system."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay all right let's just take a breath on that right there for now.
11458.0,Patient,"Although he did reassure me today that that's not gonna happen and i'm like aware of that that's not going to happen, but it doesn't make it. easier for my anxiety to do."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah exactly that's yeah. yeah, so I think it's definitely an area probably that's going to require some some work and just some really. Maybe even just re establishing some boundaries for both of you. You know, so that. You know because I think for you it's that would that would help you to. not have that like. Now all or it's like all or nothing. Like more fear of abandonment or. And how to how do I manage that. yeah like yeah like where where do I draw the lines with this friendship. Because that's what I was you know part of me, it was wondering, you know, are the are the feelings between the two of you like, you said you know we're just not at a point to be together but but is that a place where you guys want to be together."
11458.0,Patient,"I don't even know because, like having known him as long as I have he's not a boy."
527.0,Provider,"Well, the other thing too is I mean. If you're if you're both dealing with codependency issues with each other, that would definitely need to be addressed if you guys were going to be together to."
11458.0,Patient,"Something that we individually trying to work on, but I don't know how successfully there must have been in trying to parse it out, because, like we know enough about that stuff to know that we're codependent but not necessarily know how to get out of being codependent. On each other and, like the. weirdly the only. Framework i've ever gotten for codependency in therapy has been related to substance abuse. And like codependent relationships with people who are suffering from substance abuse or like suffering with substance abuse issues which has not been my experience, so it can occasionally be kind of hard to differentiate like how that works functionally in a. relationship where that is not an issue because. Neither one of us is well, he was not spectacular with certain things when we first met. But that's probably one of the strongest boundaries that I have drawn is that, like when he gets really depressed or like when he's like really not feeling great he's like man, it would be really great if I was doing trucks again because he was. Doing like. That like he had a pill problem when I met him. And so that's like one of the biggest boundaries that i've drawn because my dad has really bad substance abuse issues. Where I have like very clearly been like look if you fall back into that pattern I love you so much, but we cannot be friends like we cannot have a relationship, if you are using I can't support you in that I can justify that so that's like my big effort at at setting a boundary."
527.0,Provider,"And what's his response to that, with you kiersten."
11458.0,Patient,"it's good it's it's usually good it's usually that he is aware that, like this is a feeling that's going to pass and like he doesn't want to actively like to get back into doing drugs I think it's just like he gets so overwhelmed with he's like it would be nice not to fulfill the ship. Sure um. But then, you know, usually after he can like articulate that he's fine and then I think he has a pretty good response to it, because he is like yeah no I don't want to. do anything to Fuck up our friendship, although he. In some of his worst different states, we have both done this to each other, where it's like you know I don't think i'm a very good friend for you like you know I don't know if i'm being the best friend, I could be so it's like this weird like that doesn't happen very."
527.0,Provider,Often okay.
11458.0,Patient,"But it has happened before. Okay, like we have to. Encourage each other, like remind each other that like shit happens and we're both like very aware of how. Okay, you know varying mental health. Issues can sort of impact relationships like very aware of the fact that we don't want to blow up our relationship, if we're both having like whatever mental health swing one way or the other."
527.0,Provider,Okay um.
11458.0,Patient,"So I I think it's good in that respect, and that we can recognize that, like even when. And I don't do this, that often at least I hope I don't often like lashing out at each other when we're in like bad mental health places to like give people an out I guess it's something that I know i've done before. And he does it to sometimes, but it really depends like we're usually. fairly steady in terms of like moods and mental health things and like we both go to therapy semi regularly, I think I go more regularly than he does, at this point. But we are both like actively you know in treatment to some extent, or the other, so I think that helps a lot to with. Sure, like things that maybe we don't feel like we can actively handle ourselves. In our relationship, because even the other day we were talking about something, and he asked me a question and I was like oh man dude I think that's a therapist problem and not a me like I think. I think that's something that only your therapists going to be able to help you with. So I guess in that respect I have more boundaries than I thought, because there are some things that I just don't feel like we I am. The best person to talk about them with. Okay, oh. sure some conversations we just don't have because i'm like I don't think I can actually help you solve this and I don't want to just sit here and have to tell you. shit you don't want to hear, or like sit here and not be able to help you with a problem because I don't know how. And i'm not qualified to do that and so we've definitely had probably more recently conversations where i'm like look I don't know if I can help you with this, and obviously I will support you, while you process this but, like maybe talk to your therapist."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, that is a better idea."
11458.0,Patient,"um which I have not always done, because I tend to be the kind of person who wants to fix everything for other people. Because it then makes it easier for me not to have to fix anything that i'm doing. which I have tried to work on and tend to do a little bit better with these days I think um, but I think that also just comes with having a lot of therapy and like actively trying to work on all the weird and bad shit I know that I do to try to cope with. life in general, and all of my. Various weird mental things that somehow seem to keep piling up that's a good."
527.0,Provider,Ah. Where do you where do you feel what or what do you feel like needs to be addressed going into this weekend first kiersten like like what's the weird you know what's the weird vibe you're getting with meeting the girlfriend.
11458.0,Patient,"I mean I don't even know if it's like a weird vibe because they seem really happy and they're both like. Like he has not to his, not that I know his girlfriend is aware of, but like his shared with me like texts. of theirs, and like because he's like okay I don't know if this is like a bad thing or not when they're having conversations and i'm like no she seems like she's really. willing to support you and help you process like things when you don't quite know how to do it and you're just like they have really good boundaries and they're like really good at communication which he has not traditionally been exceptional APP. So, like, I can see that there are a lot of like really positive really lovely things in this relationship that I like really want him to have because I feel like I have that with my partner, and I really want him to be able to experience that, because I know how great it is. So I think it's just I think I think it really boils down to just this weird anxiety about whether or not she's going to like."
527.0,Provider,"wow i'm wondering if part of it, too, is just it's your you're having some grief reactions to."
11458.0,Patient,"yeah. That could be it because I think it's I don't think I think rationally, I am like relatively capable of understanding that like I don't think, so this is going to be the same kind of relationship that like he has had with other people who stated in the past. As long as I have known him because in some of those situations we have virtually stopped talking, because he has just been so wrapped up in this other person so it's like I have a basis of knowledge that he does do this without really realizing it. And we can pull away from each other, pretty hard, depending on the circumstance. And we, you know we always figure it out, but like we don't fight about very much ever like we usually can talk about things pretty easily and pretty thoroughly. And we're not really shy about you know, expressing like hey you're being addicted we talk about this um so we're pretty good with that, but they're the couple of fights that we have had have been involved either one of us pulling away because of like. The way either my relationship is going or away one of his relationships is going, and I think in the in the time that I have known him this already feels like the healthiest relationship he's ever had okay um. So, for that reason I like also really want to make a good impression on here because I don't want it to be like oh man your best friend's a Dick I think your best friends like the worst person like I don't want that to happen, because I would feel really shitty. Okay, I don't I don't. Think, at least I feel relatively confident that's not going to happen and like I said we've talked a little bit already because he's been very excited to like facetime with me when they hang out so that I can talk to them both. And she's been very sweet and like we have a lot of things, but we're excited to talk about with each other, specifically that maybe will doesn't really. Like he likes it but not maybe to the level, but his girlfriend and I do like reading link we're really excited we're both huge reader so we have both recommended books to each other and bought those books. So far, so like that's already something that we're we have bonded over which is more than I have ever gotten from any of his other girlfriends so I was like Okay, so this is like you're really trying with me in a way that I haven't experienced yet so it's like. I get a weird vibe because of me, and not because of them because i'm actually very excited to be her I think she seems very great, and I think it will be a really cool weekend to get to. meet her and hang out with her in a way, I haven't been able to yet so like on that front i'm really excited so, which is part of the reason why i'm like Fuck I wish I didn't have. Any of this anxiety attached."
527.0,Provider,Okay well so let's talk let's talk through this a little bit and figure out like what you need going into because. I think it's also maybe going to be helpful for her to understand like. Where your. Where your limits and boundaries are with them because. I wonder if there's any part of her that feels like. she's the middle person.
11458.0,Patient,Maybe.
527.0,Provider,"And and and I so i'm so I went to kind of dissect this apart your sin because I don't. You know i'm not it's not about like pointing fingers or anything but let's look at like let's look at all these pieces like okay you're coming into the knowing. Knowing they're together, and so you you kind of feel like the outsider. But maybe she also kind of feels like the outsider coming in, because you guys know each other so well and so. How do you navigate that dynamic and so, in part of it is. Can you allow him to have a healthy relationship with it without you it meaning. You, you are the you are a friend and they are the relationship. Does that make sense. Because you have strong feelings for him and so. It kind of clarifying that are working on that codependency like are you still going to be able to meet your emotional needs. With. Within yourself and your relationship, as well as maintain a friendship, but have boundaries that he can develop his own. healthy relationship as well, like. I know, but I need you, I need you, I need you. Yes, you be okay to be okay. versus i've got other people that that contribute and help me be okay as as also I know i'm okay within myself like and and i'm confident and that and maybe that's the struggle is not feeling as confident in yourself like. To be okay, if he if there is a healthy distance between the two of you."
11458.0,Patient,yeah I definitely think that's something I need to work on. Although I do think it's actually.
527.0,Provider,"I mean it sounds like you're you have in ways, but really I mean I just the emotions that I see with you today, like it's definitely it's definitely a lot deeper for you like this is a, this is a deeply emotional relationship. mm hmm yeah."
11458.0,Patient,"I think this has been a better. At least i've I think i've had better luck with. Being separate from their relationship partially because i'm not there, like that helps that. i'm not up there, they don't live there anymore that it's not like. You can come see me every single day like yes we talk every day, but sometimes we don't like sometimes like this weekend we didn't talk very much at all, because his girlfriend was hanging out with him."
527.0,Provider,All weekend.
11458.0,Patient,"So, and that was fine like I just did whatever this weekend like I was doing stuff with my other friends like friends that I also physically don't live near but like like my I guess Internet friends and my partner, so I was like doing other things, so it felt fine the surprisingly um. Okay, not to. yeah not to talk to him as much, and I think it also helps that like becca his girlfriend also has a similar relationship with one of her very good friends like it will jokingly. has called her like becca's version of Houston like they're very, very close like they have like they're very similar people from what I understand and like they have a very close relationship and the way that we have a very close relationship so like I think. Maybe in some part of my brain it's nice to know that, like becca has that relationship, because then she might understand what our friendship is like."
527.0,Provider,yeah but also knowing. Where her boundaries are with that with you.
11458.0,Patient,"yeah even when. Even when will send me screenshots of like their text messages I, at one point was like hey is it okay with um."
527.0,Provider,yeah that's what I was whiners.
11458.0,Patient,"sending me these and he was like oh I didn't say anything I was like maybe you should tell her that you're sending me. screenshots of your text messages like Maybe she should know because I don't want to be weird about it, like I don't want to. I don't want to have an insight into your relationship that she wouldn't want me to have. flake right, so in that sense, I think i'm trying to be an adult about it. And like set boundaries, a little bit more than we usually do because it's usually the he shares that stuff with me when he's talking to somebody and he's like what the Fuck is going on, because the person descends a big so fucking weird like the conversation, and something just so. asinine that i'm like. What the Fuck is happening. But it hasn't been that with becca it's been him and obviously i'm not him, so I can't say for sure, but it does occasionally feel like he's just showing me that, like it's Okay, like their relationship is good. And that they're communicating in a way that he's usually like I said traditionally bad. um but. has been much better, much better with with becca than with anybody i've seen him within. The five years that we've known each other. So I think he's maybe part of it is just trying to like make it clear that he's like hey I have this really good thing and you're my best friend and I want to show you. So I I think I do have figured out how to set up a boundary there so i'm like yes, I appreciate that you want to tell me about this because it's very cute and I am very proud of you for like being. Being able to have these conversations, but also maybe your girlfriend should know because I don't want to feel like. I know too much about this person who I haven't even properly met yet. So that maybe is a boundary I need to put up in a way that I haven't done before, because we talked to each other about everything so it's just. Like maybe I have to have this have this one boundary for the sake of whatever relationship, I have with his girlfriend whatever friendship, I have with his girlfriend to be like hey this is your guys's thing you deserve to have private things that are just your. case and I don't need to be involved in."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, oh my thought is we, how was your. How was your partner with all of this is there any has there been any concern or question or conflict with. Like hey when I talk to me."
11458.0,Patient,"No, not in not in that sense. Well, in my partner, have a weird relationship, because they were friends initially when I met will and we dated and then, when. Will and my partner have had like a weird at some point, like a few years ago had like a weird blowing up so like for a while I didn't talk about them to each other, like I didn't talk to them about each other. Okay, so it was like this. This weird distance that I had to have and. Slowly but surely. They are getting over themselves and like growing up, I think, part of it is that they're both younger than me so i'm like how the Fuck on you guys like we just figure this out um. yeah and they both have, I think, part of the reason that they blew up so hard, is that they both have extremely similar personalities and they bought heads pretty easy. Because of them, and they also both have be PD so that is like another navigational thing that they both understand about each other, but also to pack. So it's like. They have done some growing up in that intervening period, and I don't feel so weird about talking to we to. them about each other, like it has become much easier and they don't get nearly as talking awkward about it come. And even yesterday on the phone I was telling will stories that I think i've already told him, but I was just like trying to like. comfort him because part of his anxiety about his girlfriend is that he thinks they he he has a lot of hangups on like societal expectations of the things that he does. Just because of like the, the environment, he grew up in so he has like this really. Deep set I don't know if it's paranoia or like deep said weirdness about the fact that, like they've only been dating a month, but they've told each other, they love each other, which i'm like you can fall in love with somebody like seven seconds students so it's like really not. It happens it's not weird it's completely normal thing, and if you feel that way, then you feel that way and so."
527.0,Provider,we've been having more and more conversations about.
11458.0,Patient,"My relationship with my partner, because we've been like I say that we've been dating for a decade but it hasn't been like a straight nine years of dating. Like we've broken up on and off we've had weird problems like at various points in our lives and just keep coming back to each player because, like that's the relationship that we want to try to make work in. Our respective live so like. I was explaining to him yesterday that like I told my partner I love them after i'd known them for three months. It was and we weren't even dating when I told them that I love them and then we didn't talk for three days, because neither one of us knew how to process that, so let me. um I was just explaining that to him and he thought it was funny and I was like yeah i'm just trying to like show you that this is not weird and like it was probably the most comfortable we've been talking about my partner with him and I think it's just like. Sometimes, he has this weird hang up where he doesn't I think he sometimes doesn't think my partner is good enough for me, but i'm like look dude i've known them longer than i've known you. I love them, they are not going anywhere in my life so like we're gonna have to figure this shit out because this is not changing like."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, which is."
11458.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, probably the drug use and then that is probably like my biggest boundary that I have with him is like I love you very much, but your opinion of my partner is not going to make me break up with my partner like. You need to figure your shit out because I think you are bringing something to the situation that like is probably more your baggage than mine that I can't sift through for you. yeah so like that's I guess our other. Our other big boundary that has been. Pretty consistently solid and. Still is solid, but like they are finally getting over whatever bullshit they were holding on to you. In terms of like their general annoyance with each other yeah. um so that was it was weird for a while, but it's it's significantly better now than it was. Okay um so yeah that's another like weird spot has been a weird spot in our friendship. And I was like a weirdly tense and I was already going through like a bunch of a bunch of. Mental health bullshit so like to add that, on top of it was. Like so much to do with, so I think i'm Finally, like in a place to process that and try to get them both to like deal with their shit so that I can have these two functionally important relationships in my life like be good. and not have to feel like I can't talk about them with the other person. Because that was really hard."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm wondering too if maybe just having a conversation at some point of. And, and this may be down the road to may take some time you know time for you to think through and figure out how you want to approach this but i'm wondering if at some point you guys need to sit down and have a conversation of. Can we both agree that there needs to be a shift and change in our relationship for us to. allow each other to have healthy emotional relationships with our partners. hmm and. That it doesn't interfere in those relationships like. yeah you know really clearly defining a friendship versus because it's kind of got like. yeah man, the mash."
11458.0,Patient,of multiple.
527.0,Provider,"yeah like a meshed with each other, like if I pull up if we. If we pull apart. We can be individuals and be okay and and we can be friends and in also have boundaries, where we may not share as much with each other and we both know that because we're sharing it in a healthy way with with our."
11458.0,Patient,"Partners yeah. Yes, yeah I think that actually yeah helpful conversation to have, I think. For me, it will be easier, as he is with becca longer because I think it's helping me to see that, like she really cares about him, and she seems to be very good for him in a way that I have not thought as partners were before which is like a very judgmental thing on my behalf, but like. You just not always the best people today like objectively."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, maybe say which may speak to how he feels about himself so care Stan. yeah you know so."
11458.0,Patient,"He is very superficial people usually and he dates them because they're pretty not because they're Nice or cool or if he has anything in common with them and, like I haven't. Between the two of us, I have the ability to think everybody i've ever seen this cute so like every time he shows me somebody where he's like I don't really know if they're that cute i'm like did you have eyes, like what. You see this, and so like becca is like the nicest sweetest person and she's adorable so it's like. This is, for once, and like he keeps telling me stories about things were like she's genuinely super interested in learning about things that he likes. And he's genuinely super interested in learning about things that she likes and i'm like this has never happened to you before please explore this. Please do this so. I think it will help a lot to know that he has a really good relationship which I have never felt like has been a thing before. Okay, and he's even admitted in like. The quote unquote best relationship, he has had since we've been friends, I use that in his terms now. um has mostly been he was really into this person because her family really liked him and he felt really comforted to like be in that environment. And so, then he was pretty fucked up when they broke up but i'm like I don't ever think that relationship was like healthy for either of you guys. Like it was her first boyfriend ever so like and he has issues when people are like immature about things and i'm like dude you. Are not dating people your age and then also we were in a lot of ways, because of like the weird shit that we've both grown up with more mature than the average person at our respective ages, so that has like a whole nother it's like a whole nother can of worms to. tackle so it's like we've both kind of processed and I guess grown up in a lot of ways as much as you can grow up and you're you know mid to late 20s or whatever i'm. Like yes or i've known him for most of my 20s like early to. late. So we're both trying to in increments do like our own little bits of growing up, and I think as that happens we. Have a little bit easier time setting boundaries like they're still not great like we still need to set a lot of boundaries that I don't think we have and don't have the words to like articulate at this. Point i'm. Sure, but I think we both know because we've definitely had conversations about like our codependency issues and how to get through them I just think we have a hard time pushing. Like I think we, we know that they're there, which I think is good, because I, I am not convinced that everybody who's ever been in a codependent relationship knows what it is and can. You know recognize it enough to want to do something about it, which i'm like yeah I am not even convinced that in five years, we will be living on the same continent, so we need to figure this shit out. And that's also like one of the conversations we have semi regularly is. He wants to move back in together and i'm like yeah that would be really great, but like we really need to nail that down like we really need to figure out a lot of details. Before either of us can do that because I don't know how long i'm going to still be in this country, and you don't know whether or not you even want to stay in the state so like we need to figure out a lot of things before we ever even attempt to do that, and so they did not happen. and So that's like one of the big random conversations that we have like semi regularly, although we haven't had in a while, which has been fine because i'm not in a position to move anywhere okay. And then his is always like Oh well, I could go to Grad school and such a such a place and i'm like dude you hate school, please stop trying to make yourself go to Grad school just finish your BA and then be done."
527.0,Provider,Yes.
11458.0,Patient,"Yes, is he yeah again he has this like weird conception about like what he feels like he quote unquote needs to do with his life, which is mostly like what he thinks his parents want him to do. So that's like a whole nother thing that we worked out, we have like a lot of emotional baggage with our families that we have a lot of conversations about and have bonded about which I think also is like. Both helps and hurts how codependent we are with each other, because, like Oh, you are a person who understands all of the like weird shit that goes on. With my family and like weird anxiety that I have, and like I can articulate it to you in a way that maybe. My partner my other friends wouldn't understand, although my partner does also understand because they have divorced parents, but their parents have been for since they were like four. So it's it hasn't been as much of a thing, although even their parents are like. My partner has told me stories about how, when they were younger like after a certain point, and their parents could barely stand up like be in the same room as each other, and now they are completely fine. i'm partly because I think my partner's dad is engaged to somebody else and has like a new function like a good, solid relationship. In his life and now it's in a position where he can. Be around my partner small like freaked the Fuck out um so it's just like I, I have a lot of examples of like what healthy relationships look like, so I just need to like really try to process, what are fucking Gordian knot of a relationship is um."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I was going to say you know, maybe a starting point to it is you just sitting down with your Journal and looking at where where are my co dependent pieces in this."
11458.0,Patient,"I think, is where we've got a better definition of what it is what it."
527.0,Provider,"Is yeah like. joy what emotional needs are getting met by this behavior or this behavior or this, and so what are, maybe then what are some alternatives of how to meet that emotional need within myself, maybe. yeah or."
11458.0,Patient,or even like.
527.0,Provider,My partner or yeah. Coping strategy.
11458.0,Patient,"yeah coping or even just trying to set boundaries around like what emotional needs we need for each other. yeah, so I think that might help I just I have a hard time with boundaries in general, because I feel like it makes me feel like i'm punishing the person that i'm setting a boundary with but like i'm not i'm just trying to take care of myself."
527.0,Provider,"yeah Well, yes and and the and for them to. Have that limit to to be to know how to be, I have a more respectful. relationship between the two of you, not that you're not it's disrespectful but. But a clear respectful healthy. Dynamic like. Yes, I know you have emotional needs that are unmet I I can support you in some of these other others it's your partner your therapist need a new work on that or you work on that just individually like. yeah, we have to be our own individual people to. yeah and I. think we are and be okay being our individual people."
11458.0,Patient,"Yes, I struggled with that. As somebody yes deep seated self esteem issues. yeah oh that's that's what i'm gathering to kiersten because what i'm what i'm wondering, is that."
527.0,Provider,"When I said grief is my thought is, are you feeling like oh i'm getting i'm getting replaced and now i'm out the door and and that's that that's that black or white thinking so is that going to trigger you to escalate unhealthy behaviors to grab on and no, no, no don't leave me when. Okay, realistically, yes, he needs to establish your rational mind says Yes, he needs to establish a healthy relationship. I I deserve a healthy relationship as well, and need to have that opportunity for myself, too, but know that it's going to change our dynamic is going to change and other there are going to be some losses of the relationship. To experience, and so I just to be aware of that, for yourself like i'm gonna. have some losses to grieve. yeah I can also have lots of things that we can gain by setting some clear boundaries and and taking care of myself."
11458.0,Patient,"yeah I think it will probably also help in just giving myself time to remember that, like. Even the changes aren't a bad thing, like people don't stay the same forever."
527.0,Provider,yeah. yeah yeah.
11458.0,Patient,"It will be a process, but I am. Hopefully, working on it slowly."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well, I think it, you know, for you to just even identify and say hey I need to work on this, this is a problem. I mean that's that's the first step to take, is okay like let's look at it a little bit further like how am I getting my needs met and where where did the boundaries, need to be drawn in that so that. You know that i'm not putting all my eggs in that basket and then, when he walks away like what am I left with. yeah."
11458.0,Patient,"yeah that's the struggle, I think this this weekend was a good. Surprisingly, good sign of the fact that, like we don't need to be in constant communication for me to be like, oh no what the Fuck is happening like I do still like somewhere in the back of my mind i'm like oh I haven't talked a little today that's a little weird but like. It doesn't. make me panic in the way that. Okay, it used to. Okay, which is good, but I think it's partially also thank you, at all because maybe it's a eat a lot easier for me to like function in a way that lets me reach out to my friends more regularly where I don't feel like i'm isolate myself so horribly. So i'm already talking like i'm talking to my partner and i'm talking to my. Other friends, we. were literally than I was before. Okay um. And like. yeah and processing things away from will that he has no idea about like that I just don't. feel anything else about not anything that he needs to be involved with so it's like."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, and on that front, I think I am."
11458.0,Patient,capable of. Drawing drawing boundaries and. natalie before.
527.0,Provider,Which after that.
11458.0,Patient,"And so I think yeah I think it's just both of us learning that, at the same time, is really the difficult part because i'm like Okay, I know that I am trying to do this, and now we should maybe wrangle you went to try to do this so that we're both working on this together, but separately. In our in our own ways, but I think. I managed to talk myself. out talk myself out of, I guess, a lot of my anxiety like rationalize a lot of it because I could understand why I was feeling that way and, like the experiences that we've had in our friendship before that has made me feel that way. So i'm like this is, this is not that this is not what's happening. And he's been he's been good about it, like reassuring me that, like that's not it's not going to impact our friendship like we're still going to be friends, no matter what his. relationship looks like."
527.0,Provider,yeah and the friendship may just look different and be different and but but that's okay it's. gonna it's going to shift and change as as you guys grow and develop closer relationships to your partners.
11458.0,Patient,"yeah. And if I don't have like a. frame of reference for this because, like there are people i've known since I was five like we're still like some of my best friends, sometimes we go months without talking and then, when we talk it's like we talked two seconds ago. Sure, so it's like i'm aware of what it feels like to have that relationship it's just a matter of like. getting out of the maybe even just getting out of the habit of knowing that this person talks to me, every day, so I start to rely on that, like I don't need to."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11458.0,Patient,"It will be a process, but I swear I try."
527.0,Provider,I hope that you have fun kiersten and. enjoy yourself.
11458.0,Patient,I think it will honestly be really fun and I feel better and even after several points of almost crying over this conversation um.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I definitely I mean there's definitely a lot of emotions there, so I think just being aware that that they're there right now and. And that's okay like you've you know you're you've clearly invested a lot of yourself in to this relationship, and so you know it feels uncomfortable trying to kind of real that back in because of. yeah and it's like oh I gotta look at all my junk now."
11458.0,Patient,"yeah I have to process all this stuff about myself that I don't. Think about would you probably also why i'm anxious about it. um but you know I working on myself as hard, but I know that it helps and that it's like. rewarding in the long run. So setting boundaries just really perpetual theme of my life, and one that I need to work on, which has been easier, with some people than others, it has been remarkably better with my dad than it has been. With will, although with my dad it mostly was blocking him so that he can't talk to me because that's what I need. yeah yeah and it's not at that level with well but. yeah yeah I at least know what boundaries feel like, even if I am occasionally bad it's."
527.0,Provider,Not let's not say bad at setting them. they're difficult. Their challenge yes for me.
11458.0,Patient,"I can do yeah but their challenge yeah yeah. I get there, eventually, so yeah. I guess they're just."
527.0,Provider,"They are yes i'm not i'm not gonna lie, they are hard so so I was looking to see we've got our next appointment then Pearson on. The 11th thrilled Member 11th tenants. Excuse me at 10 o'clock does that still work for you."
11458.0,Patient,"Yes, because I have the day off, so I should hopefully already be awake."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, and then do you want to go ahead and schedule the next one. yeah we can November."
11458.0,Patient,"um so nothing is the next one, the week of thanksgiving."
527.0,Provider,"It was Okay, yes. Okay, yes, so obviously i'm not working on thanksgiving but. Is there a day that week that is better for you."
11458.0,Patient,"um I think thanksgiving would really be the only day that I was actually doing anything, so I think any other day would be fine i'm sure i'll have to work during that week, but I do I get at least thanksgiving off. I have group on Monday, so any other day, but Monday and Thursday."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you want to shoot for Tuesday the 23rd."
