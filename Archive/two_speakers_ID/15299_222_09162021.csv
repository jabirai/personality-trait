222.0,Provider,"And then, what would you do."

15299.0,Patient,So that was my previous doctor my substance abuse doctor was ready for that.
222.0,Provider,"Okay, and how did you When did they start. You know the Eric purpose was actually an Anti psychotic so it's not typically something given for anxiety or depression, to start anyway so i'm kind of curious about that."
15299.0,Patient,I don't know he started it maybe a month ago.
222.0,Provider,"Oh, just a month ago."

15299.0,Patient,yeah okay.
222.0,Provider,"And how about brothers and sisters, that you have."
15299.0,Patient,Two sisters and they're both addicts.
222.0,Provider,um what what kind of drugs.
15299.0,Patient,"Typically, everything."
222.0,Provider,"Like opioids and alcohol. yeah okay. Before you started treatment, how much money would you say we're spending a week."
15299.0,Patient,A week. From we are more.
222.0,Provider,And was. was your boyfriend or where was it causing any relationship problems with anyone.
15299.0,Patient,not really. My parents.
222.0,Provider,"Okay, it were issues with your parents. Were you still getting any high at that point, or were you mostly using just not to be sick."
15299.0,Patient,Just not to be safe.
222.0,Provider,"Am I doing the math right are you 2425. Okay, so they had you do a depression screening, that we do you know, called the pH Q nine about kind of daily symptoms. Your score on that was 25, which is very high, like severe depression. And then your anxiety score was 13, which is also severe anxiety score do you think that sounds accurate to you. What you said right now, no current thoughts of suicide. Okay, so let me tell you something about bright health and kind of how we work so we're all telemedicine, you know you meet me the doctor this first visit. After that I see you weekly in a group session, where we have a therapist and myself, and then other members of the group they're all in. I think most of us have right now, are all North Carolina everyone has some opioid addiction history of you know, various kinds of drugs and street drugs, but all opioids and everyone is on medication, whether it's suboxone or somebody tag. But beyond that you know people might have their own other issues or different doses that part you know isn't it's more just unique to the individual. It is considered you know, a private group so when you're in session with me or with a therapist one on one you can kind of be how you are now, but in group, you have to have headphones so that. The other group members don't you know because somebody could be behind you that we can't see and they could hear what's going on. So you have to have headphones and grew up there's no substance use in group no smoking, either because some people trying to cut back on smoking or or or have quit as hard to watch somebody. We understand sometimes little kids running in or are around that's that's fine grown ups can't be around or in the room, you know adults actually like teenagers and etc. We do often mute people and that's not you could unmute yourself whenever you have to say anything will often mute people just to make sure everyone can hear the person who's talking. But we do encourage you to join in and. You know, offer support or advice to somebody if they're if they're talking just because you're muted doesn't mean you have to stay quiet. And, but sometimes there's like you know people of background fans are things that they don't realize that we can hear her so we just turn it off in between. The groups meet once a week and that's typically kind of our the way that we work once sometimes people if they're really not they're struggling and they're not coming to group. will actually require more will say you know you have to come to three groups or three times, we need to see you. Instead of discharging people out and sending them to a higher level of care. So, but if you make the groups, every week, then actually we have people move up to every two weeks I have people coming once a month, you know so eventually things. settle down if you're doing well, can have with the program the other part of it is one on one individual counseling and that's twice a month. it's the same counselor that will be in our group so you'll get to know her well she's really down to earth very good and she schedules those you know kind of around your schedule and those are usually about 30 minutes. So, and she gives you her email, but you set up the first appointment and usually then she sets up follow ups during your next visit so you're kind of scheduled out, and you know your schedule. And then, as far as our urine drug screens, so they may have talked to you already about getting an initial set of labs so they talk to you about that okay. So that when we asked for in the first one to two weeks after that you get a drug screen mailed to your House monthly. The important thing is to remember not to open it until you're in the virtual clinic like this in a zoom session they'll have you open it take it out up and then the you hold it up and they read it right there. Generally that's all we need sometimes there's discrepancies were some things there that you are not expecting and you're you were saying you didn't you know use anything. And then, sometimes we'll send you to the lab to confirm, if you told me, you were using and I knew it was going to be there, then I usually don't do that because I just. You already told me there's really no point i'm just talking to you about hey, what do you think's going on, how can we prevent this, what happened kind of thing. We don't kick people out for you know relapse or or returned to us that's not part of our program the main ways people get discharged are really if they're not showing up and. yeah so that's kind of the main way if we're really struggling with that um. So that's kind of the way we work, as far as the labs and the groups and then individuals so i'm not a psychiatrist i'm an internist and that's train and substance use. So I will treat people for some Depression and anxiety I generally don't treat bipolar I don't give stimulants for ADHD and this type of setting. So tip so i'm looking at what you're on it's certainly not what I would have started so i'm going to ask for the records and see if we can keep you on this, but if you're. worried if you're not doing well on these medications if your scores are kind of saying that hard and you're feeling that anxious and depressed. Then we might want to consider I can ask for referrals for separate for psychiatry you know out out of brain heart health. That way, you have someone that you're talking to you because, generally in groups, what happens is I go around to each person and just ask kind of how's your medication, how are you doing any substance use. And then the therapist goes and gives like a therapeutic session we focus on a topic, or if someone's had a really stressful week we focus on that. So it's sometimes not the greatest venue if you're feeling, you know if you're needing medication adjustments for depression, anxiety, like every few weeks. But i'll look over the records and you know we can do, you need refills on these yet or you have. To pay so. we'll kind of figure that out, as it goes and see about you know adjusting. If your score say that say that highest walks I don't want you to feel. That depressed or anxious every day it's you shouldn't you know you definitely shouldn't. So, as far as medication you're familiar with it, so the part I was going to talk about with subby talk is generally with medicaid. They I don't know if you've had to get prior offs before or yeah so usually every time I get a new provider, they have you do that again, do you have any documentation from like your pediatrician or the hospital that your baby is allergic."
15299.0,Patient,"I can probably get it, but."
222.0,Provider,"yeah that would probably be helpful for getting a prior off because i've had there's medicaid has been changing in the past few months there's been a lot of denials. For you know for approval for that so it's something that we do require now tell me about when you took suboxone in the past, like how did you physically take it, what did you do with it."
15299.0,Patient,put it under my phone.
222.0,Provider,"And then, what."
15299.0,Patient,Let it dissolve.
222.0,Provider,And then want.
15299.0,Patient,Those it.
222.0,Provider,"Okay, so I wonder if no one ever kind of talk you through how to actually use it. which we wouldn't do now, when you're breastfeeding, and your babies, but i'm worried, especially later when you're not breastfeeding it's going to be harder for us to justify staying on Sunday tech. So for suboxone you put that put it under your tongue like you were saying you wait till it dissolves 510 minutes or so. When it dissolves and basically nothing else is left all the saliva that's left in your mouth you spit that out. So people that are doing that were never told that and you're you're just letting that go down your throat and then you're swallowing it. that's usually what gives people the nausea and sometimes headaches it's the swallowed medication within the locks on in it. Going in the bloodstream usually people do well with that, as long as they do that so that's something for the future, so for you, your homework is to work on getting you know, a record of allergy to sub you tech for for your baby. And that way we can work on that for for prior approval approval to keep you on the justice up you tech instead of suboxone. So. To talk about it, though the buprenorphine medication. that's in suboxone and and stop you chuck is what works for opioid addiction it gets absorbed into the bloodstream like I said it's not absorbed through your stomach or intestines. And once it gets in the bloodstream and goes to the brain it attaches to all those opioid brain receptors That is where heroin would attach percocet morphine methadone any of the opiates would attach their. It doesn't activate it in the same way, so it works, a little differently when it attaches to those receptors and that's what allows the medication to work so. It stops through your cravings you know helps you feel normal it doesn't really doesn't give you a high and has much less you know, have a low withdrawal, as you know, if you don't get it for a day or two, you will feel like you're. Withdrawing and you won't feel good that doesn't mean you have any addiction to the medicine that's just the way the medicine works addiction means that you're you know spending lots of money or getting things and it's interfering with your life it's kind of the behavior part so. Sometimes you'll hear that from people, but I like to clarify like you're not actually. That you're dependent on this medicine, just like someone with high blood pressure would be taking a blood pressure, medicine. And I know you've been on it for several years, sometimes people start asking me like when can I come off of this. All the evidence that the longer you stay on it, the lower your risk of relapse or overdose so we don't push anyone to start weaning or tapering or or coming off of it. Certainly, while you're having big life changes like you're taking care of little babies and you know you're busy like that we don't encourage anyone to kind of start tapering down. But if you are interested in the future, we can you know talk about that, when you feel things are going well, sometimes people will go from the three that you're on and go down to like two at some point and kind of hang out there for a while. And some people stay on that for years and years, the one reason, some people do like to get to a slightly lower dose is because. Then that way if they ever need more pain medication if they're having say a dental procedure or a surgery, we can give you increase doses of yourself, you talk or suboxone. And you don't get into trouble with opioids and things, whereas when you're on three a day and we don't have too much room to go up but that's kind of just future talk I just like to mention it in case Those are questions that you might have or think about. suboxone and somebody Tucker controlled substances, you know they're written through controlled license by me. As such, you're required to keep track of the medicine if it's lost we don't replace it early. If it is stolen you, we have had people file a police report and then we can when we see that we can refill early, but obviously that can. can happen over and over it's your responsibility to keep track of the medicine, if you want to keep it away from children if they were to accidentally get into it, you want to call poison control. It generally has very low risk of overdose particularly compared to opiates and things, but it can be dangerous, you know and children or pets and can be dangerous if you. combine it even accidentally with downers like alcohol or fanzone Valley, you know all of those types of things sedatives like barbiturates any of those can be dangerous and combination. You always want to tell any doctors that you're on savvy tech, so that they know and they don't give you something that'll interact the wrong way. And that's that's mostly side effects like you said, some people get headaches or sweats those sometimes will go away for people in a few weeks, but some people do struggle with that. And then constipation just like opioids can be the other side effects so just making sure that you're having regular bowel movements, some people do take over the counter fiber supplement and if it's worse still just mentioned it to me, and we can talk about other things to do. Those are usually the main side effects people experience as far as our program so we usually start off by sending a week of. medication, at a time so every time after group I send your medication you pick it up, most people picking up the next day, and then they have it for the week. If you know show to a group or to therapy then your prescription, we never take medicine away we just make you go to the pharmacy more so your prescription would be like three or four days with a refill instead of the whole week. You can get down to every two days, basically, which is super annoying. But then also people as they're in the program you know for a few months they move up to every two weeks and they'll get two weeks on medication and eventually have some people getting also like a month of medication, at a time. And you'll hear me say to people like you're all in the green, which means like it's a green light you're good to go your chart is up to date and ready to go. yellow is that, like half prescription like the yellow light and then red light means like oh boy what's going on you've missed a lot of things, how can we help here. The group's. times I don't know if mornings. or after or sorry mornings or evenings work better, for you, we have to open on Tuesdays which are 7pm and 8:30pm at night, and then we have Wednesday is at 930 and I think the 11th a little full so probably 930 would be the one open."
15299.0,Patient,Probably do the Tuesday so 37% yes it is.
222.0,Provider,"Tuesday at seven i'll put you down for that one and that's Eastern time a bright our health is a California based company so just make sure whenever you're communicating you if they give you an appointment say is that North Carolina time because somebody. accidentally give you a California. But so 7pm is. Is on North Carolina time. And the group so they'll give you a zoom ID like this, you just go right to the group at 7pm on Tuesday. We start letting everyone in, and then we close it at 715 so don't leave before 715 if we haven't let you in. But also, if you show up after 715 like if you try to come in at 730 we have already closed the group and we can't let you in, and that does count as a no show now if you. email, you know the therapist or text bright heart health before that you're having something you know conflict of schedule, then it's marked as a cancellation and not a no show. And that's what affects that prescription obviously you can't just cancel cancel cancel or eventually. It doesn't work and we understand that people have you know. Things that come up and we try to like be accommodating um let's see so that's all about checking into the group i'm going to send you I don't know how familiar, you are working with zoom if you've done a lot. yeah you have what the other group Okay, do you know how to chat and everything. Yes, Okay, so in group I usually try to mention if you were to become pregnant or have some health issue that you didn't want to, for some reason, bring up in group, you can always chat that to me. A lot of people do bring things up and group, though, you know of course that are personal, but sometimes people feel uncomfortable at first so. That number that I just chatted to you can screenshot it that's the bright heart health text number, you can use that to just text the virtual clinic and ask them anything like hey. what's the zoom link I lost it or you know something like that that helps people avoid having to go to the virtual clinic sometimes because there is often a week in the virtual clinic so we try to help you out if you don't have to if you don't have to go to the virtual clinic. The other part that they may have told you about is the surveys, so you do surveys every week, one of them is a called the BAM BA and that's like a survey about your cravings and symptoms and substance use that once once a week. Then the ones that you did the pH Q nine and GA D for depression, anxiety or twice a month and then sometimes they'll send you other surveys, they usually will email it to you with a link whether it's a pain management survey or. How you're doing in daily life anything they send you just do basically we use that information to keep track of people scores and see how they're progressing in the Program. i'll try to mention it to you in group i'll say like hey did you do your surveys looks like they're overdue as a reminder, if you if you know if you're falling behind. Oh, and if you yeah I won't give you too much information how about so far I know i'm saying a lot, do you have any questions so far. No okay i'm nice to meet you me, pull up your.
