I didn't know I had to go to the virtual clinic first before and they're like well yeah you have to come here to let him know I said, well, we already had a time set so I just assumed. I would go on his you would know he would be there and they're like no, you have to come and confirm before you go i'm like alright, so that was my fault."

And or every other week for the meeting and it just I said he didn't come and I thought, maybe he had something else that you're doing or had to call off for a reason, so I just took screenshots show that I was there and."

14291.0,Patient,Honestly i'm not sure I want to say.
214.0,Provider,February of.
14291.0,Patient,As long as I thought so.
214.0,Provider,"Should you you're you're already past a year, I mean you're going on to when you think about it right."
14291.0,Patient,that's been about to be about a year and a half year. closing in on two.
214.0,Provider,"yup yup so i'm thinking, we need to change the frequency again. So i'm. January January December. November October. So, probably in October we're going to go down to one individual mean you stay with the to stay with the two groups per month."
14291.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"And then, in December or change it to one group, a month, and one with me so we'll do it even before you anniversary two years."
14291.0,Patient,Okay okay. So you want to so we'll do counseling once a month and group once a month.
214.0,Provider,"So when we need the next session in September, because we got to pull to off. will decide what we're going to do in October and then just roll that puppy out. i'll change it for October to be once and then in December i'll change it to be once again for group and then how however long you decide to stay. You know, in my chair I probably would consider it to put you like on a quarterly basis, I have people on currently only see him four times a year."
14291.0,Patient,Okay okay.
214.0,Provider,You know because I mean you know you're you're doing everything you need to do.
14291.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and. I have i've been to other places i've been to they have a. I live in Lancaster and Ohio and you know i've been to they have like a place here like a. it's an in house place but you don't stay there you just go for your groups for meetings, the snap recovery Center. Man when I first got on xbox and I started going there well they had that place was not house, I mean. They had so. just out of control there I just couldn't do it, you know i'd be at the groups and like people were being crazy and groups and like people getting arguments to start fighting and. So I left there, well then, I went to this place to get suboxone that where you go, but you have to go every week every Monday. And i'm not joking when I say this every Monday you sit there for about five to six hours just waiting to see the counselor. I went there one time, and when I saw the counselor this lady talked I counseled her. She talked about her son, the entire time and how her and her husband are split up and her son went to live with her husband and. she's got all these issues, and he doesn't trust her, and he doesn't want to be he doesn't want to see her, I mean she had so many issues over this. i'm not you need to take some time off or like and get work through this because, like. you're not helping anybody by them coming in here, and you just talk and talk and talking about your son, the whole time. And that's what she did us where do you she did she talked about her son, the whole time and how the dad did this did that, and you know, and now the sun's doing this and that josh."
214.0,Provider,"yeah no totally some states. Or the suboxone I mean I don't know Ohio seems to be really like main that that's a very particular because don't two states have a lot of restrictions like they're not letting people like flying their own they're really keeping everybody. Like again. You know and it's it's, I guess, we got nothing better to do, Sri but like when you try and have a family have a job go on vacation that just doesn't work."
14291.0,Patient,"Right and the thing is with that place, you have to pay like. I want to say it was like $125 every week every Monday. that's a car payment. A month counselor and then to see the."
214.0,Provider,"Right, because you can't get the medication without seeing the Council."
14291.0,Patient,"Yes, so they're making money, like all day every day and that's what it's about."
214.0,Provider,"At some. point it is. So I mean they have there's a big place he that has a methadone clinic I think they got 50,000 participants. it's you know, everybody has a scheduled day it takes you almost 18 months to get 14 bottles."
14291.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So, and then you got to come back with 14 bottles, God forbid, you don't come back with 14 bottles you done so, like. Forcing you to use the system. But it's like so where's my growth, where do you trust me how do I figure out I can do this and that's why I like Brian Brian has a very different outlook. And shoulders Dr Malik we both kind of see things the same, so I think this makes sense when we we know people are going to be responsible there's no reason, we need to see them all the time, we need to see the people long responsible, the time."
14291.0,Patient,"Right that's what I was getting to know you know, was that you know, then I came to buy her health and it's just like. Oh there's been like a lifesaver literally it's night and day because when I was struggling before it's like trying to get on track was impossible. Because things were so crazy and trying to get in somewhere and get the medicine and get counseling and this net and like learn things it was like off on off on. On constantly so I couldn't get things on track and then you know you you don't have your medicine and then you're wanting to use again, and this net and it just."
214.0,Provider,it's a nice. it's a nice it's.
14291.0,Patient,Just my life's gotten tenfold better since I came to bribe her.
214.0,Provider,"But here's The other thing too in all fairness you're making a decision. To do what's right to you can get what's right, and then you can do what's right so but. Right you're going to these other facilities, they don't really care you got an alternative plan, they need you to get there when you got to get there."
14291.0,Patient,Right yeah yeah.
214.0,Provider,"You know and and you know what you know 130 urine is like it, I know what people go to like it's it's just it's crazy man, the world is crazy so how's your depression you think you got any depression."
14291.0,Patient,"You know I I battled that for a long time um. You know i've always had depression my whole life more anxiety driven depression than anything but uh. I don't know, I think, like the last few years, like the last couple years i've it's you know i've it's funny you get older and you see you think. You know there's not more that you're going to change much more as far as who you are inside like this and that but, like, I still. realize things and learn things that I never even things that I knew, but I didn't look at in a different way. So i'm like still learning things all the time and, like oh so like the past couple years like since ever since i've been like 3940 like my life's just changed so much like the way I look at things changed so much, and you know my anxiety and my depression, has just been. Nothing like it used to be right, and I think being on suboxone regular and not having that where i'm on it then off and on and off it helps to because suboxone not just you know, to prevent from being on you know. Whatever drugs, you know heroin painkillers whatever for me, you know, like I said I battled anxiety bad anxiety my whole life just things that happened when I was child and stuff and it helps with anxiety like amazingly. Like I don't have. near the anxiety when I have my suboxone that I that I used to and it's not even like a relapse or a painkiller type thing it's like anxiety in general, like that I used to have like it just wipes it wipes it out like it's weird but."
214.0,Provider,"With it, listen, what if it's providing you that support, so be it, I mean really like you know the problem is that the anxiety, you know, can lead to the relapse than the depression friendly. Like all those things have they have different ways of messing things up, actually, so you know I don't see your carbon score is i'm looking. back in June, but they were very low, they were minimal, but you're saying you know you don't you don't it seems to be manageable today versus what it was in someone in the past."
14291.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,yeah okay.
14291.0,Patient,"I have to when you know when when Dr Malik left and Dr jamison came in, it was rough because. i'm not an advocate, and I think everybody at bright health knows that, because she just. I mean, she messed my prescription up over and over and over she would write the wrong prescription she wouldn't call it in. House you went on vacation and didn't call any of our prescriptions in and then she called it in for one week, and she was on vacation for two, so I had to go to the."
214.0,Provider,Virtual clinic.
14291.0,Patient,"grip different times wait four or five hours for them to get old because they only had one person at that time you know and Mary Jane and. Who was super super nice I love that lady she is just awesome but Dr jamison and then she would treat you like you know if you missed anything at all, or like you know. had any type of thing, she would talk to you and treat you like, you know how dare you kind of thing like a mess i'm going to lower you now or i'm going to do this and it's like I promise I have missed less meetings, then you have screwed up. My restrictions. I promise you do, you get punished."
214.0,Provider,Like come on like no you're right. you're right.
14291.0,Patient,"i'm not the only one, you know, there was like when I I finally got tired of it and brought it up in group one day and that there must have been five other people in that group that chimed in like I agree, you know I agree she's. Miss mine up. yeah you know it was just. That they said, Dr Malik was coming back, and I was like Oh, please, please, please. Just let me back Dr Malik please and they did so."
214.0,Provider,"it's been notes what I like to be able to do is we don't have anything set. For another September, we got to get another one in. So i'm hoping, you can do next week."
14291.0,Patient,That work.
