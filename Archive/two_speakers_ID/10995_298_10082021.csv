298.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're back with us, and how can I help you."
10995.0,Patient,"um well I. I was seeing Jesse for my appointments, but I got. Really busy with school and I have a really demanding. schedule right now. i'm in an accelerated graduate Program. So, which is why I it's been hard for me to to be consistent. But um. yeah I feel the need to like. Continue therapy, because not a lot has improved with my life situation it's actually worsened. And I definitely feel that I need support."
298.0,Provider,"Okay okay um are you. Are you in need of any medication how's your sleep, what are your moods like."
10995.0,Patient,um I definitely feel like something could help me i'm feeling very depressed. and jesse's been telling me that the emotion that i'm dealing with is grief.
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
10995.0,Patient,"And I just feel like. I just have moments, where I literally just feel like crying."
298.0,Provider,Right right. On so.
10995.0,Patient,"i'm like. i'm tired all the time um it's during my classes i'm falling asleep I like concentrate, I cannot concentrate. um. I have a very hard time retaining information. i'm just going through a really hard time and I know, last time that when I started therapy I didn't want to take medication, I just wanted to do talk therapy. I feel that. This time around um I definitely feel like the chemistry in the brain or I don't know is a definitely shifted."
298.0,Provider,Okay. So you're open this time to maybe replacing some of the serotonin that's getting depleted because of all the grief you're going through.
10995.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"And you know I want to tell you i'm a big proponent that you don't have to be on medication forever, you can be on it for six months, a year and see it, you know come off of it, but you need to give yourself a break and your brain a break from the the anxiety and depression."
10995.0,Patient,yeah um I don't see myself like being able to handle school and they handle all the demands that I. That i'm expected to um. To me with the way that i'm feeling lately.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
10995.0,Patient,"I don't want medication. that's going to make me tired, I really want something that's going to make me focus and be alert because. i'm falling asleep in my classes."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, but at the same time you're sad. And so uh you know. Would you like to look up what medicine at based on my recommendation, or would you like me to tell you about it and then make a decision."
10995.0,Patient,yeah you can tell me about it.
298.0,Provider,"Okay there's a medication out there, called the effexor effexor is unique in that it gives energy, which is usually like something like wellbutrin that's a dope amine one but don't effexor gives energy and it helps with anxiety and so. that's what makes it Nice is that it does, both those things. Normally antidepressants can give anxiety. But they can kind of come the body down too much in it takes away your. Energy because you're being calmed down the downside of effects, Sir, is that it is just so nice to get on and finally feel like I can get things done and focus. But when you start to come. off of it it's feels like it's hard you have to do it really slow because it's harder to come off of it, because it makes you feel like you get like little. brains Apps they're not hot they're harmless but I just want to let you know coming off of it is not the most fun and it takes time to get it. But it has been a lifesaver for a lot of people to get on it and get through a period of their life and they can work on counseling do those sort of things. there's always wellbutrin but wellbutrin could it'll give you focus it'll give you energy, but if you have anxiety problems. It might make your anxiety worse so. Tell me about your anxiety."
10995.0,Patient,yeah i've suffered with anxiety in the past and I definitely do have. Anxious episodes.
298.0,Provider,haha.
10995.0,Patient,I definitely don't want to do anything that's been a trigger that because I did go through panic disorder into any team.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah and that's what concerns me as i'd like to see how i'd like to kind of treat. The anxiety part of it and not trigger that. Okay um do do you want to do some research on it before I started, do you want to email me I like to make sure that patients don't feel like i'm pushing medication."
10995.0,Patient,"No, I mean if your expertise. is enough for me I don't know much about. medication Okay, though."
298.0,Provider,"I would be happy to give you some, and so I want to see you in group or one on one, but I just need to follow up with you to make sure that you've got the medicine that it's working for you and that you're not having side effects. Side X camp go ahead."
10995.0,Patient,I was going to ask you about. I would prefer individual because I know the group's me at a certain time certain days of the week. I literally have like a full time and then some job with school.
298.0,Provider,"I probably hear them these. So here's the deal, I can't take away groups completely, but what I can do for you is bump it down to once a month. I another words if you're going to be in our program I have to do at least once a month group. for you to stay in our program, and that is the bare minimum."
10995.0,Patient,"And then these groups, you do have availability on Fridays at all or."
298.0,Provider,"I do, but it's only in the morning from 8am to noon. One of noon, is the last one."
10995.0,Patient,"Okay, I would probably be able to do some Fridays."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, one Friday, a month."
10995.0,Patient,yeah sadly.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, if you don't then you're going to get into the same position that you were in before and I don't want you to do that."
10995.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's, not that I don't want to it's just I feel so tied down with my school I literally have no life outside of it."
298.0,Provider,"I know I, and I, and I wish I had a different program to offer you, but I don't. Do you want to continue."
10995.0,Patient,or MIA okay.
298.0,Provider,"I am doing that okay um if if this causes yourself to happen upset stomach just know that it'll go away it shouldn't be too bad, but that might be a side effect and i'll start you at a low dose and we'll go up slow to get to the dose that works best for you."
10995.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and if you ever need me you're welcome to. email me but I don't think you can write down my email address."
10995.0,Patient,No um. If you if you can. Are you able to email it to me.
298.0,Provider,"Next time, I see you i'll give it to you."
10995.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good yeah."
