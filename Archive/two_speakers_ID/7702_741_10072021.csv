7702.0,Patient,"um. it's a roller coaster I hate being pregnant. I always wanted to happen because i've that's been my like live Stream is to be a mom. mm hmm and I thought I would love being pregnant, but this first trimesters kicking my ass. mm hmm so."
741.0,Provider,gracie does me.
7702.0,Patient,"I haven't had too much morning sickness, but my mood swings are crazy and my fiance and I have like broken up once already because I just can't handle anything."
741.0,Provider,Is gonna have to be more. consider it.
7702.0,Patient,"Yes, he's working on it."
741.0,Provider,"and much more. understanding and. They don't realize it, but our hormones go buzzard boy."
7702.0,Patient,And he's actually been like. super sensitive to.
741.0,Provider,he's probably experiencing some level changes as well yeah.
7702.0,Patient,"yeah and he's not used to that at all so. One day, like he was really sad he's like I don't even know why i'm sad welcome to my life. You only have to deal with this very short amount of time. I have to do this for months."
741.0,Provider,"Well, and not only that, but we also deal with it once a month. From wrestle we're old. Right So yes, it's not um because even though. We have the baby, we still have the period every month. mm hmm and I don't know about you, but mine were crazy."
7702.0,Patient,yeah my I have endometriosis really bad. So minor. very painful very neurotic.
741.0,Provider,yeah so what what is the um I would imagine the with Dimitrios you've got. A lot of restrictions with this pregnancy.
7702.0,Patient,"Well, I haven't had my first doctor appointment yet so that's on say."
741.0,Provider,that's plan to say. yeah okay okay be prepared they're gonna they're they're going to. restrict your life.
7702.0,Patient,Really. yeah like what.
741.0,Provider,"Well, it just that there is with endometriosis as a hardening of the lining of your uterus so is going to be more difficult to keep the baby comfortable and say. huh okay so you're probably going to have some. Physical restrictions. And you're probably going they're probably going to insist that you get a whole lot more bedrest and you want. Okay, so just be prepared be prepared and and be willing to do whatever the doctor says. You know. Working there's probably going to be something that you might have to put on fat burner. So just just prepare your mindset okay. Okay, then i'm going to be flexible. Because that's what you got to be and it's just prepping you for when you actually become mom and have to deal with the stuff on a day to day basis. right because they make you be flexible. um alright, so what issues, if any, are you having with your recovery."
7702.0,Patient,"i'm with my recovery i'm praying I feel good about my recovery. With the pregnancy and the hormones, I have been wanting a drink. Just because me I think it's because I know I can't have one. or it's like you know, like people say that you can't like a glass of wine or whatever, but yeah."
741.0,Provider,Not when you're pregnant.
7702.0,Patient,"Right that's what I think too. But like knowing that I personally like cannot have one it's not a choice now. Right like it was before I thought that probably messing with my mind, a little bit um but late and they even say non alcoholic beers and stuff is not okay so i'm like I can't even like have a cheat like that even."
741.0,Provider,"So that I know, and the reason is. Because there is still a percentage a very small percentage, but there is a percentage of alcohol in the near beers."
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and because of that, it will affect the brain of the child. Right and the chances of fetal alcohol syndrome and any. on any level just not acceptable, and maybe if you can change your mindset I can't that to more of thinking about it, as far as what kind of damage could it possibly do to the baby. Right what what disabilities would that child have to end her. Because of my choice. Right um so that might help um when you think about everything that you consume drink eat breathe, everything is going into that child. and yeah there's a lot of stuff that our parents did. And we turned out okay. Maybe. I mean someone think about it. If your parents you. They set you up. may set you up and if they use like if mom used or dad used while she was carrying you. They set you up to be an added."
7702.0,Patient,"Even if dad uses to like my fiance stuff like stop drinking them own I got pregnant, but i'm."
741.0,Provider,"Like Well he can drink every wall so because it's not chemically it's the baby's not physically in his body. But the attitudes toward drinking D um. And anytime there is a genetic there's a genetic connection, so if he was an addict or an alcoholic and you're an addict or an alcoholic that baby's got a genetic strike on two sides. Right like just to give my son, unfortunately. What he's baton 1000. His father's a full blown addict never been in his life, and I was an addict full blown. And us, while I was carrying him. He doesn't have a prayer. So, yes he's an addict. hey and then on top of that me raised. So all the behaviors are there. So, if he didn't have a chance. i'm fortunately. He hasn't gone down a lot of the roads that i'm that I went down."
7702.0,Patient,that's good.
741.0,Provider,um he does smoke marijuana. And he does smoke it like an avid.
7702.0,Patient,hmm.
741.0,Provider,You know he's not one of those that smokes it takes a couple of hits and puts it down and goes on about his business.
7702.0,Patient,"Good I don't like that, with with pot like I would smoke if because I have all sort of colitis also so I for the pain that's not good for nausea but I don't smoke it like I don't enjoy it I don't enjoy getting as high as I can. And right like that's."
741.0,Provider,that's not becoming a vegetable.
7702.0,Patient,Right that's not fun for me like I get if I get if I smoke too much i'm that i'm not type that like I don't want to go anywhere like. Right walk to the kitchen to get something like i'm in bed watching TV and i'm bringing my food in first.
741.0,Provider,"couch potato couch potatoes julissa. Well, see that's what he that's what he does he is that a motivational syndrome, where he's not doing anything I mean literally nothing."
7702.0,Patient,Like you.
741.0,Provider,"said yeah he that. He does say frequently. That this like you know now he's had to stop because he has a he has a child of his own and. Financially, he can't afford it and physically he can't not be available for his daughter so i'm."
7702.0,Patient,"Like my fiance he's kind of like like not the couch potato type, but he smokes a lot like he doesn't smoke around me anymore, but he's like like if he's not working he's smoking and. Like if those pens now make it so easy when, but he is completely opposite of me like he's highly functional and I don't understand it, I don't get help some people can do that. Like he can get completely ripped and still be like working on cars and working like clean the House and, like, then I."
741.0,Provider,don't know I don't know how that happens.
7702.0,Patient,crazy.
741.0,Provider,But but yeah no i'm Am I son is a motorcycle mechanic for a living. But um I tell you what I don't want him there my machine if he's high. right because I don't know I don't trust that he'll do what's right. So you know um. But. We have to stop and think about what what what effect does this have on the child. And and that's. it's the most unselfish thinking that you can have.
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"But it's also the most rewarding because, when that little baby who relies on you for everything, and you can't imagine the love that you have for it. it's it's not even something I can describe or or help you comprehend that this. Brain I mean you're getting an idea of it, because you can actually feel the child growing."
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,um at least I could I mean.
7702.0,Patient,"I can feel myself expanding I can feel the child growing, but I can feel my body changing."
741.0,Provider,Moving yeah. yeah i'm the first week after I. I was 35 when I finally got pregnant.
7702.0,Patient,Now i'm 34.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have an idea of. First of all, it's a late pregnancy in terms of body. Okay, and age. um so yeah. it's a miracle, because you do have endometriosis. And because you are 34. years old. you're pregnant and, and this is a precious situation. And and i'm really happy for you. So amazing."
7702.0,Patient,hold many times that it probably wouldn't happen to me.
741.0,Provider,"I was told at 27 I would not ever have children. Really, and I went all of that time. From 20 i'll probably 25 actually 1035 without ever using any birth control."
7702.0,Patient,know I will years without having birth control and.
741.0,Provider,"All of a sudden 35. I was the guy and I was the next week, I was sick like so awful sick and then the woman, that I was hanging with at that particular point turned around looked at me and she said you pregnant. And when you are full of crap. was supposed to be able to get pregnant, we went and got Okay, and after one week you're not supposed to be able to detect it and she went and got. A couple of different ones from the store. And they were all positive."
7702.0,Patient,After a week.
741.0,Provider,"I even went to the. To the planned parenthood, and the little town that I lived in at the time, and they are like it's not going to show up. It hasn't been long no. And I went in and I did the test and it didn't even take the full amount of time to come through and say yes you're pregnant."
7702.0,Patient,Did you have twins.
741.0,Provider,"No God. Oh, the other lady that he got pregnant, the same guy got another lady pregnant, that the same time she was pregnant with twins. He walked out and he walked out on lives did not even look back and he was back in person. Before either one of us has gotten through the first trimester. wow so, but this other lady had to do with twins or skills."
7702.0,Patient,or girl.
741.0,Provider,"i'm just like Oh, that is awful."
7702.0,Patient,geez i'm hoping for twins just I can't I because I want to kids but I don't want to do this again. yeah I understand in front of my family and i've been a nanny for twins like my whole nanny career and so. Like at least one family that was the ending for had twins the whole time I was a nanny and so like my mom always thought like god's preparing you for twins like it runs in our family but it skipped me so your next in line.
741.0,Provider,I very well could happen.
7702.0,Patient,"And i'm already eight weeks so either I got a big boy in there, or it might be twins i'm kind of hoping, though."
741.0,Provider,yeah yeah. sounds like it i'm.
7702.0,Patient,already got names picked out and everything.
741.0,Provider,twins run and ran and his family and I was adopted and the family that I was adopted in twins run in but I don't have their genetic makeup. But um. But I was fine with just having one.
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"But yeah I mean immediately I knew, she was like I wouldn't really not feeling well and it was not normal I mean it was it was indifferent not feeling well, so I knew something was going on with my body. And when we. When she suggested that I was like she's slip. And then Sure enough, she was right."
7702.0,Patient,crazy.
741.0,Provider,Hours like.
7702.0,Patient,Is she one of those people that has like that or a sense like she could tell just by like.
741.0,Provider,I guess so she's an older Hispanic woman and she just. She just knew.
7702.0,Patient,I had some sort of like power like that. Some people have that they can just see it in you.
741.0,Provider,"yeah it is. So. So what kind of things okay we've talked about the the desire to drink, what kind of things, do you think will work for you to continue to abstain oh."
7702.0,Patient,"i'm i'm my fiance's going to set up my little arch in the studio and a partner apartment because I. crafts and stuff. Oh, I i've been recently i've been making bracelets and i've been. I used to make earrings a lot like that was my when I would like, if I was bored morning to go to something like that. or I go shopping."
741.0,Provider,Good yeah and let's not do that one not yet. Of course you're probably going to need clothes.
7702.0,Patient,"yeah but. i'm only i've always been like super tiny, so I don't know how much I want to grow, so I can I mean i'm only 98 pounds right now so."
741.0,Provider,i've gained.
7702.0,Patient,"Four pounds since being pregnant, but. i'd rather get close until my bit my belly gets big enough to actually get the queue maternity stuff."
741.0,Provider,Right right. I hear you on that one um. So.
7702.0,Patient,"I did, though, for pregnancy winter clothing, though, because I love layering it's going to be acute with the pregnancy sweaters and stuff i'm excited."
741.0,Provider,Right right. And where are you located.
7702.0,Patient,In Chico California.
741.0,Provider,Okay okay.
7702.0,Patient,Where are you at.
741.0,Provider,i'm in Texas. Okay yeah i'm in East Texas. fairly closely i'm like an hour away from Louisiana.
7702.0,Patient,Oh wow to wait.
741.0,Provider,yeah and hope okay. whoa. All are too loud katie. And so. Are there any other issues that you think I might be able to help you with her help you work through or. i'm. Taking your medicine right.
7702.0,Patient,"Yes, I haven't brain, though, and I want to even like I want to get off of suboxone by the baby, by the time the baby's born. Because I don't want the baby addicted to anything because it already has like you said already has a genetic makeup of fanatic, so I don't want born addicted as well. But I talked to Dr Escobar about it and i'm already down to a quarter of a strip. Okay, and so i'm going to do that for another like week or so. And then go, she said to try and not take any completely but i'm too scared to go from a quarter to nothing so i'm going to go down to an eight."
741.0,Provider,"i'm. Okay, I would also consider, I would also discuss that with your Ob."
7702.0,Patient,yeah i'm definitely going to.
741.0,Provider,"Because, because this could be putting undue pressure on the fetus and undue stress. hmm um i'm not usually one to advocate for staying on medication. But in this particular situation I would listen very carefully to my Ob. me hi because of your. Because of the endometriosis and because you are 34. Those two issues i'm already stressing the situation."
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"So getting completely off of suboxone may not be I mean it may be too much, it may be too stressful. Okay, and and you know because, like. Because your body is accustomed to having that and then you've got this little child. Pulling on your systems, it may be too much. To remove that and have this child pulling on your system piano Shannon i'm saying. and also the other option, the other part of that too is that once you have the baby you don't want to relax."
7702.0,Patient,"No, I do not."
741.0,Provider,"So I don't know if you're planning to breastfeed or not, but. The idea that. It is very stressful for the fetus as well. for you to come off of some oxygen."
7702.0,Patient,"Is I stay on it, and then the baby's addicted to it does it just like wean off with me through breast milk."
741.0,Provider,It will wean off with the breast milk and i'm not real sure how the pediatricians handle that with a winning the baby off i'm.
7702.0,Patient,going to get taken away from me if it's born addicted to something.
741.0,Provider,"No, not if it's born digital suboxone no, it will not if it is addicted to any other. Illegal substance, yes, it would. Like in this situation. No, it would not. Okay okay. But I would be very."
7702.0,Patient,Sad just thinking about.
741.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I know I know they're not gonna they're not gonna take them from you. If you're on suboxone you're doing what you need to do to make sure that you can be the best mom that you can be okay so that's not an i'm not telling you to stay on it, if that's not what you want to do okay. But when you're talking about. A pregnancy that's already kind of at risk. you're going to want to do everything you can to protect it. And um, so I would, I understand that um. That you want to you don't want your child to be addicted to anything but at the same time you want your child to live this pregnancy and come."
7702.0,Patient,out yes.
741.0,Provider,"Would you know and have the fighting chance that it needs, and so I would definitely talk to your Ob okay. And and get their input on it, you know i'm just be really upfront about your your history and all of that okay. Okay okay so and I support you, whatever you do okay. i'm here to support you, no matter what decision you make. hmm hey and I will help you work through whatever feelings you're having whatever fears are having okay. Okay, so that's I just want to make sure that you're aware. Of. All the parts. Right hey. um I. mean I would imagine that um you know for Schreiber would be aware of your endometriosis and stuff like that as well. So I mean. So she probably knows the is going to be okay, but I still I would suggest, making sure that you're very upfront and open your Ob. Okay, just. Just from what I know of of the situation. Right and, mind you i'm not a medical doctor. No chemical dependency counselor okay. i've had a little bit of life experience um. cuz i'm a grandma now."
7702.0,Patient,Oh Nice.
741.0,Provider,But oh.
7702.0,Patient,My mom can't wait she's so excited.
741.0,Provider,I bet I bet. yeah my my mom. Was not excited out first.
7702.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
741.0,Provider,"Oh yes, no my mom was adamant that I, my mom actually wanted me to abort my child, because I was not married."
7702.0,Patient,Oh wow.
741.0,Provider,And we had words.
7702.0,Patient,I bet.
741.0,Provider,"And then, and then she tried to convince me to give my baby up for adoption and effect, most of my family did, and my mom I my son was six months old before my mom met him. Oh really yeah. But after she met him I spent some time with him, she. thanked me for not listening to her."
7702.0,Patient,"Oh, I bet yeah."
741.0,Provider,"yeah she was she was very, very happy that I did not listen. And that he was such a blessing so. and So is there anything else that i'm giving you all of my two cents that you probably weren't wanting."
7702.0,Patient,Oh no it's okay i'm not sure do we have an hour today is a half hour.
741.0,Provider,"And I have an hour I don't know. I don't remember how long we were supposed to me, but I don't have anybody so. If you want to hang out, we can, if you don't want to, we cannot."
7702.0,Patient,"I just have to get ready to go, I can stay for another like. 1015 minutes, so I just have to get ready to go pick up my nanny kids. But I do suffer from anxiety and i've been I don't know if it's like a pregnancy depression or something but or maybe it's just fatigue that's getting the best of me i'm not sure what it is, but i'm constantly wanting to cry and sleep all day."
741.0,Provider,That has.
7702.0,Patient,been the pregnancy.
741.0,Provider,it's the pregnancy it's your hormones um they're gonna make you i'm very teary. And that's okay just cry. it's okay.
7702.0,Patient,I don't like crazy.
741.0,Provider,well. A lot of people don't like crying but the thing of it is just that tears are very healing.
7702.0,Patient,Better afterwards.
741.0,Provider,"Exactly. They will always make you feel better in the long run. it's not something that we enjoy doing, especially when we do the ugly guy. But. It does something for um for your spirit. You know. Why don't we want to admit it or not, we are three parts beings, we have a soul, we have a spirit and we have a physical body. and basically. We are spirits that that. have an experience in a physical body. and We have to take care of our spirit do."
7702.0,Patient,Maybe you can help me figure out how to do that.
741.0,Provider,"Okay um do you um. Well, let me ask you this, do you have any kind of idea regarding a supreme supreme being."
7702.0,Patient,My God. Yes.
741.0,Provider,yeah OK so. My suggestion is that you pray to that to God and whoever you choose that to be. um and that you actually develop a relationship. With God. um and how do you develop a relationship. With that person.
7702.0,Patient,I have one with him. But as far as like I guess i'm not understand like when you say that. Like taking care of your spirit I don't know.
741.0,Provider,"um one of the ways that we take care of our spirit is um through through prayer and meditation. um I actually do meditate every day. um and I do it in several different ways, some days, I have to actually do a guided meditation where I turn on music and I actually have to. go somewhere specific in my mind i'm like I have a special place that I go, especially if i'm really stressed out or i'm feeling really hurt. That, then, I go to this particular place because it's my safe place. um and I look at the scenery and the colors and and try to focus on that stuff and that's very healing for my spirit. Okay um. So maybe you want to work on developing a safe place that you can go in your mind when you're meditating and see if it works see if it helps."
7702.0,Patient,"i've tried to like do that, like go to a happy place. Like my brain is so active that like I think about other things, while it's while i'm trying to think about that or certain people mess it up, or like I, and I know it's my own thoughts coming into it's not actually those people mess it."
741.0,Provider,up my.
7702.0,Patient,Brain like I can't just block everything out and to be there.
741.0,Provider,"One of the things and that it takes a lot of practice and i'm not gonna tell you this easy Okay, it takes a lot of practice and what I have to do a lot of times is when I noticed that i'm drifting off somewhere else, I have to go back. always bring myself back. Okay Okay, and then I run off on this rabbit trail and I bring myself back it's a constant some days i'm lucky if I get two minutes, without being distracted other days I can sit there for five or 10 minutes. and not be distracted. But I didn't get there overnight, it took me, probably, I would say, probably four or five months. Like i'm not gonna lie, it took me that long."
7702.0,Patient,sick or. ha you listen to calming music.
741.0,Provider,"yeah actually I live when I listen to his. stuff like because i'm a nature type person I listened to stuff like running water, like little creeks or birds, or something along that line. Okay um I also have. Rain like thunderstorms. um that I listened to, sometimes too. Okay, so but it's pretty much. kind of what you want to listen to you, I also have one that's like i'm guitar picking. That is a very, very nice calming relaxing music um that that I use also so it's kind of whatever mood you're in I like guitar and I like piano without all the extra stuff."
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,So I listened to those and then I also like listening to nature sounds so.
7702.0,Patient,"Okay, the Ocean is my happy place so the real Ocean is really my happy place. Right."
741.0,Provider,I can listen to the waves wow.
7702.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7702.0,Patient,"I remember what i'm wearing oh sorry. I was just gonna say I remember one time, I went to Fort bragg and it was right after my uncle had passed away. And I we used to go to Fort bragg every year for fourth of July, and so I took one of his shirts with me and I sat on the set on the beach, and I said I didn't realize I sat there so long that I sunburned my eyes, looking at the ocean. And it like I was my mom out there for like three hours and didn't even seem like it. But i'm over summer your eyes it hurts so bad."
741.0,Provider,"I can only imagine i've got i've sunburn everything else, but my my eyes."
7702.0,Patient,yeah just the something to do with the reflection off the water and I didn't have sunglasses on like I it hurt to keep my eyes open for more than like five seconds I was constantly blinking it was terrible.
741.0,Provider,"Oh, I bet oh. Right yeah I if you were to find some and if you could probably find it on spotify or iTunes or one of those even probably on YouTube yeah that she could find. Some. ocean wave. That. would help."
7702.0,Patient,Without i'll try that once in our next two weeks until our next week or I forget one or.
741.0,Provider,"Two weeks, I think, because I don't think we're supposed to me, except for every like every two months or something. yeah so but yeah that will work. give it a shot yeah it's um yeah we meet again on the 21st so. i'm. At the same time, so. um and if, for some reason i'm running just a couple of minutes late is because I have a group right before this. Okay, so um and I can tell that this group is going to be that's a bunch of newcomers."
7702.0,Patient,Are.
741.0,Provider,"just starting, so they have lots of questions and. i'm still trying to figure out zoom in."
7702.0,Patient,On the inner conflicts are not sure how that how it works.
741.0,Provider,"um yeah. So i'm not Okay, because i'm still learning to well I haven't I haven't been with bright heart for very long. yeah i've done my art for about a month now, I guess. But I have been counseling for like 10 years oh. Nice so um. So um and the other thing that i'll let you know to is that I won't ask you to do anything that I haven't already done."
7702.0,Patient,What do you mean.
741.0,Provider,Well i'm recovering at it.
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"So if i'm going to ask you to do something i'm not going to do something i'm not willing to do. gotcha like I mean, why would I. Right, so if I if it's something that that I suggest, or that I asked you to try it because i've tried it. Okay, and it's sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean it's not going to work for you. right because we're each individual's and everybody's recovery is different. And the one question that I do have for you is do you have do you attend support groups."
7702.0,Patient,Other than braveheart no.
741.0,Provider,Have you tried any of them.
7702.0,Patient,"I have tried, a couple here in Chico but they scared me more than helped me."
741.0,Provider,Okay um the other option that that I want to suggest. is doing them online.
7702.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,You can find them where they're on either Facebook on Facebook Facebook groups or zoom platform groups. Like if you Google like a or an A or or smart recovery or one of those. hmm and you will find groups listed and just check them out check out one a week and until you find one that feels comfortable. Because definitely if they scare you you don't feel safe there.
7702.0,Patient,Was people scared me.
741.0,Provider,Thank you.
7702.0,Patient,"and You got you could tell they weren't clean people like they were, I mean it, though yeah the two I went to it was. yeah they. There was no."
741.0,Provider,yeah that was more people still use and then clean.
7702.0,Patient,"Yes, very."
741.0,Provider,Good okay.
7702.0,Patient,it's almost like you could smell it when you walked in. Well yeah.
741.0,Provider,yeah I don't like that um.
7702.0,Patient,And it was inside of church too.
741.0,Provider,"yeah well that's that's typical churches, will allow. 12 step programs to rent their room like a room inside their building to have their meetings and. that's what one of that that's why I think that this platform, as a whole lot better for meetings than in person, because. That only draw for this platform, as if you're really clean. Because in person you've got a draw. I can go connect."
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"Whereas this place, you know you could be talking to somebody across the country. Right, so the chances of finding a connection are a lot slimmer. Those who are motivated to find online or are motivated toward recovery, more so than. Trying to connect for drugs."
7702.0,Patient,"Right, I see a change yeah."
741.0,Provider,"um The other thing is when you do go to those in person um. there's always a core group of people who are clean. they're the ones running the. um if they're not clean they're not going to be consistent. And the meetings going to fall apart. gotcha um so for for meetings to consistently. be there, then it requires a core group of people who are clean and sober."
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"and mass the people that you want to find and you want to talk to you and you want to hang out with if you go to one in person, but like I said. Online is probably a better platform for finding recovery and I suggest that you look for groups that are going to talk about solutions they're going to talk about the stats they're going to talk about positive things and ways that you can handle situations, without music. And that's those are the places that you're going to find the support that you need."
7702.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,And I realized that you've got a fiance and you got support there. mm hmm um but. Like he said he's already got thrown up his hands once.
7702.0,Patient,Oh no I. I threw up my hands.
741.0,Provider,"Well okay. yeah rub your hands and said okay i'm done, you know um. Sometimes the people that we love the most and that we live with are too close to actually give us the support we need. So um. They it's a little more difficult for them to be honest and show you what you look like you know. Right it's more difficult for them to do that."
7702.0,Patient,Because they don't want to hurt our feelings.
741.0,Provider,That and we don't want to listen.
7702.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,"We don't want to hear it from them. We want to hear how wonderful, we are not how you know how our master not. i'm so For that reason, a lot of times it's good if we can find you know it's best if we find as females women who can support us. mm hmm so. i'm. Sorry, maybe if between now and the next time I see try meditation and you go to one meeting. Whether it's online or in person or however you're comfortable."
7702.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay, all right."
741.0,Provider,"i'll try all right all right, and I can give you. I can email you a. worksheet that Scott, like some stuff some like guided meditations on them. So um i'll email it to you okay."
7702.0,Patient,Okay awesome Thank you.
741.0,Provider,"All right. Well, you have a good couple of weeks, and look forward to hearing the report from Ob."
