383.0,Provider,"I just wanted to just to voice that you know I kind of have a sense that. That it's something that's hard for you to talk about and that maybe you feel some shame around it, or I don't know, I just wanted to voice that. If if you want to speak to that at all, or just talk, you know, in whatever way I don't."
4221.0,Patient,"Oh. um. yeah I can talk about it, oh okay. It was. um. yeah two weeks ago um that I wish admitted before then um. yeah before then I. had been doing a lot of studying it had been going well um. But um. You know, I was making a lot of runs to the coffee shops. I was drinking a lot of caffeine and smoking a lot of nicotine. Are or tobacco. um I was had a lot of energy. um I think that put me over the edge a little bit with. That. The. With you know breaking things. um. And when my mom came she saw and she you know kind of require that I go to an Inpatient facility. i'm."
383.0,Provider,"The queue argue with her about that if you feel that was. Unfair at the time, or how did you feel about her wanting you to do that."
4221.0,Patient,"yeah I thought I was doing fine you know I felt good I felt happy. um. But she insisted, and she ended up calling the police. and I agreed with her at that point. And when to the Inpatient facility."
383.0,Provider,"Well, how long has it been that you had been breaking things or was that was that that particular day that you had been breaking things that she saw or Had that been happening a few times and then she saw you know a few things that had been broken."
4221.0,Patient,yeah I had been breaking things.
383.0,Provider,"So she sort of saw some things that had happened over time. What is it what are you feeling now like just this moment, as you you're sharing the story."
4221.0,Patient,yeah I don't know. Okay don't go in patient again.
383.0,Provider,"yeah I imagine lots of deeply distressing events you know, having your mom calm having the police. being transported. And all of the different things that you go through you know, to go and patient. I kind of want to ask a couple other questions do you mind oh. Okay, so this individual. Roger just. stopped abruptly the session and. Doing this for groups as well. I don't think we even had 16 minutes so. I think we should still write a note, but of course it's not going to be a billable note, but I think that it's important to write that note i'm going to. Keep the zoom open and then actually maybe call him. But I am going to pause the recording right now."
