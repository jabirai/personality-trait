16506.0,Patient,"i'm good thanks, how are you doing."
760.0,Provider,Doing pretty good. A little while since we saw. I saw you.
16506.0,Patient,yeah and I missed a group to I ended up you know they they told me the pattern and I ended up switching them for you. i'll definitely make the next group.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so which book, are you going to now which what time and what day."
16506.0,Patient,"So it's on, I believe, on Monday yeah. My next one is on the 27th at 9am."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right So how have you been."
16506.0,Patient,"i've been okay difficult spots, first, I was going to tell you that. had some insight since the last time because of some of the things you said it's interesting how you do things and you honestly don't see them, I remember when. I got the job as a counselor eat up boys ranch the director telling me a big job of what we do is be a reflection to the to the boys. it's in this by saying. We need to tell us that there's something between our teeth, you know you don't see it some time so um whenever I do get. anxiety and I go on a scale of one to 10 and I go to 11 I used vocally say nothing goes with for me, you know I were you know i'm like the whole world is out to get me, and I know that's true."
760.0,Provider,and suitable.
16506.0,Patient,"To my coping skills to vocally say Alan you know that's not true and and I think that's helped a little bit. The other one was you know, I was interested I can't I don't know everything that I told you in 2007 I became disabled. And we were forced and I couldn't work, we were forced to sell our House, which was in a way kind of a blessing because had we have done it a year later, we wouldn't got anything out of it, whereas was we got it will be grand out of it. And we lived on that money for a little while and then you know we became virtually hope homeless. All all of our kids were farmed out. To their friends and then Patrice and I went and lived in Las Vegas. With friends, and it was I mean our lives pretty much stopped. hated it hated being away from my kids I had no money we had no money to do anything my kids were all struggling at the time. And, and the economy was really bad because you know, like I said in 508 the housing market crash. uh huh there's just a couple years after that we had to move to Vegas and so. We finally got to come back to Vegas which seen you know which was just amazing I was so grateful come back, but I didn't realize for a little while just held from traumatic it had been because my anxiety went from one. expressing itself in one way to another my son both my sons have anxiety disorder. One of my sons notice that, when he was really young and I just didn't understand it at all I didn't I didn't even know I had anxiety disorder. introvert and he would not answer the phone there's certain things he would not do, and I deal with it, I you know i'm a little while I was getting angry with him and trying to force him to do these things."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16506.0,Patient,"And again, I didn't even know I had anxiety disorder and so when we came back to Vegas. And I was just the county health program was so awful really was a nightmare, I think the county did more harm than good. So I finally got insurance and that's when I was able to you know go see somebody that wasn't just out of college and needed. Some experience."
760.0,Provider,All right.
16506.0,Patient,"i'm sorry but I just I just was well, I think I told you, they I will I had developed insomnia, and I went in there and they sent me over mental health and he prescribed me either ambien or at a van and then they just took me off of the cold Turkey which you in. fact only instead of going to mental health, as well, let me just go to the doctors at county and Sure enough, I went in there and instead of sending me to mental health, they they started giving me ambien and then. They cut me off cold Turkey and there was all these other medications but all they thought is that I wanted to get opiates. There was there was some reason for that, I mean I had doctors shop opiates. In 2007 2008. Terrible when I never really. escalated I just would take a lot of opiates."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16506.0,Patient,"So, but you know, like I said I was never to the point, really, I had to go somewhere else, and once I got."
760.0,Provider,cut off.
16506.0,Patient,"I didn't know anybody now I wouldn't know who to go to unfortunately because i'm this that so I started self medicating I started drinking alcohol. that's when everything went bad and that's when I realized just how traumatic Vegas had been and I always saw my mission as a catalyst, but not. in and of itself for matty and we see that and i've done a lot of thinking on that since then just just how much and how much you know resentment I don't think I realized just how much I resent the church until recently. Okay, all music. resentment, because you know, since what happened to my sister brought I don't know if it was child services, I don't I think it was just it was child services, it was through the mormon church. I about that, and I think that it had it done through you know family court or whoever Judy takes that kind of stuff I think things would have been quite a bit different I mean considering how serious what happened to my sister was. I came in, with a letter back in the House and then. I had to go to we had to go to family therapy and they didn't really want to hear about you know what else is going on. There were okay getting my father back into the House and I love, my father, but I wanted something to change."
760.0,Provider,And you wanted some improvement in your family.
16506.0,Patient,And I think the. church has a tendency to cover things up.
760.0,Provider,"yeah. sorry that you had. That you had that experience. And seems like you've struggled with a lot of things. So your focus today after you know we've talked a lot about what's happened in your past. How do you think you're doing as far as your mental health you what what are some of the strengths, that you have in those areas and and then maybe what are some of the areas that you think you need to work on. With your mental health."
16506.0,Patient,"that's a great question um my perception today is quite different than, obviously, the first time I met you I was on a six five or six week long. mania episode I recognize that now, but there was some amazing breakthroughs I did I did quit tobacco I did quit cannabis."
760.0,Provider,that's great.
16506.0,Patient,"Then doing my morning routine regularly, even when I get depressed."
760.0,Provider,What is your morning routine.
16506.0,Patient,"I straighten up my desk I make my bed, I take a shower and get dressed. And I just like chores and self care kind of stuff. yeah That was the first set of tools that was ever given to. me when I set up my own apart."
760.0,Provider,Okay. hi. That gives you some kind of. Peace or structure.
16506.0,Patient,"yeah it helps me saying to my life is circling out of control, I have control over something or something that I can control. yeah it does help, and it was hugely helpful when I first got that because I just felt I had no control of my life I was, I was being. managed by sex addiction, but now I think i'm doing really well i'm really glad what happened on October 23. But and even at the time I knew that if there was a good chance that it wasn't as great as I had hoped it would be, but I, I take the good with the bad, but I did have a really bad week and a half. and watch the video I shouldn't have I stay off Facebook, because there's so many animal videos. And I was on YouTube and I saw when I clicked on it, it was supposed to be a story with a happy ending I thought it was ambiguous. And it was one of those for I just basically crawled into the bed, and I was mad at myself for watching that video. But I think i'm doing really well at with with doing the mindfulness not I don't do the mindfulness as often as they do the. My morning chores my morning team, and my evening routine I have chores in the House, you know, like taking out the trash and washing dishes on certain days. And sometimes I just don't want to do it, but I am able to do that just before you know I met you I was calling my. provider and say listening my life is circling down the drain i've been here before and i'm whereas now I don't feel that, but I am I experienced some depression, but I done what i'm supposed to I you know my support group my wife and my kids. I taught. And you know, try to do things that would help me get through it. What was funny is the day that it rained it was such a incredible great day for me I woke up to the sound of the rain and I I don't know why the hell, I live in the mojave desert. I I lived in Laguna niguel for a while and I just love the rain I would love to move to Washington Oregon. I love it it's beautiful. And, and especially in the wintertime but there's just not enough rain, but I just had a. day and I thought oh good this this depression is passed, and I had a wonderful day that day I went down to see my primary position had. picked up some food my wife and I had a really good mail and I just thought to depression was over, and then in the next day or two I don't always recognize myself is depressed I first noticed that i'm frustrated and agitated."
760.0,Provider,"And then I start okay so that's the that's, the first thing you notice depression and agitation. And then you notice the onset of depression."
16506.0,Patient,"Yes, and then I realized yesterday because I was that depression was sadness and morose and sometimes it is, but more it's anger agitation. feel. World you know i've always said, if the world to just arrange his affairs around me i'd be okay. Do it."
760.0,Provider,yeah Probably not. yeah.
16506.0,Patient,"Not gonna happen, I have to plan ahead of time and I have to do it and. You know, there are times i'm not prepared for something and it's going to happen and I get upset so one of the things that I do really well recently because of the holidays and stuff there's always these family tensions regarding dinners and getting together and toys and or not toys."
760.0,Provider,"Well, things have passed."
16506.0,Patient,"yeah breath. And so, sometimes somebody will you know I react, I have a very reactive mind at times and and, and so I react, but instead of lashing out or getting into an argument I really, and this is what I really one of my takeaways from Carson a treatment Center. was taking a timeout you know you can leave you don't have to stay there, you can go someplace you can tell people I just need some time yeah."
760.0,Provider,"I need a break, I need to calm down."
16506.0,Patient,"I usually. I get mad Oh, this is so ironic, or I don't know but I get mad knowing in that moment that in a half an hour or an hour i'm not gonna be mad at them anymore, and I want to be mad at them. You know, it gives us something sometimes when things go bad and we can say woe is me and oh look what they did to me, but I really like how a taught me that my emotions are my. And so I don't I don't if it doesn't matter if you know who caused it, I mean to control my own emotions, and so I think I. Think, I have the tools, but i'm just not going to be forever pure."
760.0,Provider,"well. We all struggle with good days and bad days it's not really realistic to think that i'm going to be on point. With all these coping skills and new ways of thinking and new ways of being it's not really realistic to think that it's going to be 100% perfect because you know. Life and even recoveries there's ups and downs, and as long as you're generally on the road and and staying focused then you're good."
16506.0,Patient,agreed.
760.0,Provider,"that's very good so so yeah you have to cut yourself some slack because. You know it's harder to to apply those tools when you're feeling depressed or anxious or angry it's harder. But you do the best you can in the moment and then, when you make a. mistake, you make amends and and you correct it as best you can and go forward. But you mentioned mindfulness. Tell me. How how or how are you able to find mindfulness or or do you struggle with that or what's your relationship with that."
16506.0,Patient,"Well mindfulness is something that that works for me, but sometimes I feel that I have to be in a certain place to do mindfulness and sometimes I struggle with it i'll sit there, and my. mindfulness to me is letting my mind wander but not wander into thinking of things i've got to do later in the day. But it's it's kind of a free flow I like Susan black Mars. How she goes about it, or how she recommends that I focus on around me. I have to be aware that i'm aware, because until we are aware, you always think well if i'm aware now what was a few seconds ago. We were our conscience we're focusing on our awareness and so the deficit attention deficit goes away we start seeing things as they actually are rather than. What our brain is just replaying my head."
760.0,Provider,"I think I think we can yeah like you said, we can be stuck in our story. Yes, and and because we're stepping into the two parts with mindfulness don't forget the non judgmental. part because when I get stuck in my story, and maybe i'm feeling angry or anxious then there's some part of me that's judging that that's fighting against that. yeah that's the part. that's you know it's the hardest, one of the hardest things to let go up but that's the part that's like the most. You know upsetting for our emotional in our mental health if we can just experience the depression or anxiety or the anger without judgment, it just kind of flow just let it wash in wash out. So."
16506.0,Patient,"You said about living our story that's what you would say before they got me to thinking that these words we use reinforce bad behavior. But they can. reinforce good behavior. Yes, so that was it helped me when you said that before and i'm particularly. I don't know if you're familiar with the Professor Dan Dan it mm hmm philosopher he talks about. That we live in a Cartesian theater we're just a few moments, not moments fractions of a second in the past and our brain takes all of the incoming data rationalizes it and then creates a narrative for us, so we are literally the the protagonists in our own story. and Sometimes we have to get control of that because it can go in bad places quickly we get narcissistic and we're not on others when we're just living in our own world and."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and we're and we're reinforcing our well when we're stuck we're reinforcing our our our pains our depressions our anxieties those kinds of things. yeah and you're right we we do get a tremendous amount of stimulus, you know each each second but we're really only capable of focusing on a few of the things and that's where the story the narrative comes in."
16506.0,Patient,"You know and that's how we passed on all of our history and our our morals, you know we close it and that's why we love story so much."
760.0,Provider,yeah well we like. Order yeah.
16506.0,Patient,"So sometimes. cells to live a different story tell a different narrative because sometimes we tell ourselves lies. Okay, one of those, but I think you know I just I didn't want to you know before this session I didn't want to make one point also. One thing that I do believe that came from October 23 was a significant advancement in letting go of my ego I think that's why I can take breaks now and be quiet. And a few minutes later i'm okay and i'm not mad at anybody, because my I don't think that I obviously out, I have an ego and I always will you never. But if you can let go of your ego if you can see yourself I just love doctrines. selfish gene because he explains that we exist for other people back before civilizations rent people live long enough to get the children out their grandchildren out. And then, when we need it anymore, the body starts breaking away because we are social creatures and and a lot of our meaning comes from interacting with other people to exist in somebody else's mind."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16506.0,Patient,gives us meaning. That was my answer to me be me so suppose I don't know if you ever tackled the sisters problem.
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16506.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,I know.
16506.0,Patient,"i'm actually i'm heavily into philosophy, so I apologize, but, but just basically the gods the fates they condemned him that every day had to push a rock up the Hill and then he goes to bed, and the next morning the rock."
760.0,Provider,roll back down.
16506.0,Patient,"And he has to push it back up well, I mean these guys that wrote, these were such geniuses because it really was a metaphor online so much of life is. And how do you redeem Sisyphus is his someday he's going to die, and that rock rolling mean anything, well, if you are doing. Something that is. Contributing to society, no matter how doll or mundane it is if you're cleaning pots and pans or toilets, you are contributing to society, therefore, our lives have meaning, because we now. Are are contributing to that group. Okay, I try to see those things, and I think I have, I think what happens to other people is is ultimately more important than my own ego now but i'm human."
760.0,Provider,And i'm okay. you're evolving you're evolving. So you're letting go of that needs to be right.
16506.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,About whatever happens so that's really positive.
16506.0,Patient,"Yes, you always have to be right now I always had Desi the last word."
760.0,Provider,"So that's been a slow evolution, then."
16506.0,Patient,"Except for my know my sister. I could never get the last word on them. It was stubborn and they would just you know that story, it was by was probably sometime in the last year or two people were at a gas station and. They wouldn't let either person by nobody would give up. And so gas station order, because one of them was leaving and one of them was coming in. And so they were both pigheaded and they call the COPs the COPs came in. And they talked to them and then people still wouldn't back down and the officer said well you'll have to trust past them and then we can arrest them if they don't leave and the guy goes I don't want to rest on sides i'm closing soon, let him stay up all night. I mean that's me that was me that I know i've never been zapped they get it, but that's how they get it are. You relate my mother, my sister oh my gosh you know they would they would have to take it to the very worst case scenario, you know, like if we were going on vacation and those two got into a big fight. We would end up not going on vacation."
760.0,Provider,So throwing everything out just just need to be right.
16506.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and in the end there's really freedom to. letting go of your ego and we're taught that I mean Christ said that you know he, like you, his greatest among you let him be your servant. yeah and, of course, the eastern philosophers dealt with that a lot there, and you know if you look at maslow's theory of hierarchy. yeah your own personal needs but at some point when you turn yourself to others in the Community, you can become self actualize now I don't think I don't know if I am or ever will be self actualize, but I have made progress, and I think that's awesome."
760.0,Provider,"yeah well being part of the Community is a basic need of like every human being, and you know if we can't find meaning in our relationships and our socialization then we can't we really not taking care of ourselves."
16506.0,Patient,"Right, I agree."
760.0,Provider,You know. it's a very painful place to be.
16506.0,Patient,"I feel bad for these people who are you know. As long as they have some sense of empathy those without empathy doesn't matter they're. they're incapable caring about anything by themselves, but those who do, and they let their ego ruin their relationships and make their own lives miserable and they are a slave to their ego there is it's very liberating to start seeing other people i'm putting them first."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good for you, you made a lot of progress."
16506.0,Patient,I have and i'm sure. i'm going.
760.0,Provider,"Well, and you will learn from that because, like I said it's not a straight line up you know you've got your peaks and valleys and but, but the main trajectory is. climbing up that hill."
16506.0,Patient,"yeah agreed agreed, and I really enjoy you being there, it helps me focus, I think you know what what are my goals, where Should I be. Next time I go to group and talk to people a group, but if i'm asked you know how i'm coming along or if I meet with you, so I want to really say that I appreciate that I don't know you know, every time I get into therapy I. I don't always stay with therapy at some point I want. And I have no plans for that now and I but anyway, the important thing is this is really important to me, right now, and I really appreciate you click."
760.0,Provider,To keep working to keep working through it that's really great so. So how are your groups fine.
16506.0,Patient,well.
760.0,Provider,For you.
16506.0,Patient,"I missed the last one, but the first tool we're we're pretty good I was still manny when in my first meet. and was one of those instances when it was over with. That I analyzed everything that I said and regretted. And kind of got a little bit agitated and frustrated from that, but the next one went really, really well and, ultimately, you know when it's done it's nice for me to be able to speak and share my feelings, but I really enjoy hearing other people sharing. know I think sometimes we think Oh, you know we're. This is only happening to us but to hear other people with slightly different. Things that are going on in their lives and a. different perception of the world. it's really enlightening right, I really enjoy crew okay good."
760.0,Provider,So um so you said you quit you quit the cannabis use as a team. And how. How long has How long have you been off those two substances.
16506.0,Patient,"October 23. Oh, and I haven't touched them at all trust me. I did have when my kids came over. Recently I can't remember exactly what, for it was since thanksgiving we all got together and my son was smoking cannabis. And my. And then the other two would go outside for a cigarette. I feel a lot of guilt for that, because they had both quit and I was still smoking and I don't know if it's how much I contribute to them to starting again. But they're well anyway, but they claim to not be smoking a lot and I think they are but anyway it definitely triggered me. I definitely want this, I definitely wanted a cigarette I dreamt about it that night and the next night and my brain actually started, you know that well, you can have one, you know you can always ask somebody you know when you're out and about age, you have a cigarette or something and. You know, you can have nationalizing yes i'm good at it."
760.0,Provider,All star.
16506.0,Patient,So I yeah I overcame that I know that's bs.
760.0,Provider,And how did you overcome that.
16506.0,Patient,"Well, I definitely talked to my wife and the kids about it always turned to my core group they're they're very important to me and part of it, you know, I do have a certain amount of fear, I mean. What I went through under alcohol was you know, in the end was really, really bad and I just don't want that to come back and you know I didn't start smoking until. not exactly sure 456 years ago and it wasn't heavy never has been really heavy and I just thought it was really stupid that I had on my whole life not smoking and now the worst times you got coven and all of you. Have a circulation and i'm smoking so. there's something that i'm very happy and very proud of and. As long as i'm not overconfident."
760.0,Provider,"Then I am yes again it comes back to balance. yeah back to balance not you know you don't got this because, as I said earlier, we have our our strong days, we have our weekdays and you know if you get triggered on one of those weekdays it gets harder to. Fight the urge now with. The holidays coming up. Do you anticipate your kids coming and. Smoking nicotine and marijuana and, if so, how do you think you can handle it differently."
16506.0,Patient,"Well, I definitely will talk to me. i'd like it if they don't smoke cannabis when i'm in the room Okay, they understand that because, especially my son when he could quit smoking, he did not want me smoking around me, so I think he will Okay, and I don't mind so much if they go outside. I you know, at some point, I remember my. what's the person that helps you through a. response monster yeah. I was telling him well, we were supposed to go to Vegas and I was just worried and concerned, and this was almost before I stopped going day. And he told me says, you know I can sit down with my wife and she can have a glass of alcohol and i'm okay you worked all of your steps. Make sure you're with somebody all the time don't let yourself feel on but be with somebody knows what the problem has. And I did exactly that either I was with my wife, the entire time we were in Vegas or one of the children and that worked really well, so I have no doubt that it's going to trigger me a little bit, but you know that's gonna happen in life, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Make sure you played the consequences of that all the way through, because. You know you're opening the door to those substances once you've closed it I know it's not maybe marijuana and they all they have their their special problems, but to go back into that is opening a door. Yes, and it affects your functioning of your brain your rational your ability to rationalize and to make decisions, making it all the more easy to pick up the thing that. Really caused you the hard thing which was probably i'm guessing your drug of choice i'll call."
16506.0,Patient,Right yes.
760.0,Provider,"So. You know that's that's the danger for you, with those things."
16506.0,Patient,"greed and. I you know, I think that, through as the triggers."
760.0,Provider,"Come just remind yourself I don't want to open the doorway to those substance abuse and and you know and you're standing there as a shining example for your for your kids somebody who had who they know struggled with those things, and you can kind of show them. That and hopefully. You know it's not in your it's not in your circle of control, of course, but. You know you it is within your circle of controls. Control to be that example."
16506.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,Right.
16506.0,Patient,And I want to do that. yeah and i've got lots of examples my my brother in law to his life recently. He said the I mean the reason why.
760.0,Provider,Is your sister. Your your wife's brother or what.
16506.0,Patient,It was my sister's.
760.0,Provider,sister's husband and.
16506.0,Patient,"They were divorced at the time, but he. has always been really close to them, he was an amazing. character, you would have to meeting to understand he was really but. He could never how he explained it he never felt like he could get enough oxygen he would be good, have pure oxygen going in through his nostrils. And he felt like he could never catch his breath and I just am it felt like you know he's being tortured every day, and there was no end to it. So I could understand that, but I that really hit me. And you know he smoked his entire life but still every doctor i've ever talked to has been like no amount of smoking is okay. No i'm not we can't predict how much is going to hurt any George burns smoke cigars, so it was 100."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, yes I don't know I don't remember I know he he passed, but I don't remember. If it affected probably did affect his health right but still. He went a lot longer than any what would have thought."
16506.0,Patient,"yeah What about sexual reproduction we scramble up those genes so much and humans are so varied you know. You have some people that can drink and smoke all their lives and never look like it, then you have some people who drink and smoke and early in their life they they look 1020 years older wrinkles and. You know just really hit, some people are."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16506.0,Patient,"But yeah there's very good consequences to remember especially alcohol, I never got any enjoyment from X I couldn't remember it the next day what's the point i'm sure I had a good time I was going on with bro I know I could have been being tortured also."
760.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know sometimes some people sometimes people drink and they they get angry, or they get upset and they don't have a good experience, especially if they have an addiction problem it's you know the angry drunk is kind of a relatively common thing."
16506.0,Patient,"And that's what I was turning into I mean I had. After my wife told me, you know 10 years ago that I was verbally abusive and I stopped therapy, I have regressed after the alcohol I started out just you know really friendly fun drunk but towards the end I was abusive. Putting my wife through hell and that's what my daughter just didn't want the team to do with me for a while. So yeah it's like. it's not doing any good why don't we quit but then i'm. Fortunately, just recently my brother who lived with us for a year and a half to get dry and sober and I took him to a he went back to utah he's back on the streets and now he's in the math so I just worried. I want to say anything but you know I don't know what to do, I can't see the Nice guy just started talking to him, I can out. yeah."
760.0,Provider,"We you don't want to enable but you can't. You know, they have to choose that."
16506.0,Patient,Is.
760.0,Provider,That that's really a hard thing for you do you do contact him often are you just out there and you're not sure.
16506.0,Patient,"No, well, I have been talking to me, we were non communicative communicated for a while, because he was out on the streets lost everything lost his phone and just and got beat up and broken clavicle. Finally, reconnected with my mother gave me a call and now he and I have been speaking on and off probably once every week or once every other week. Somewhere and i'm and but you know he's always oh bro it's i'm okay don't worry about me i'm Okay, and I don't know if it's true or not, but. I just said, all I can do is give them good advice and called me one night I didn't was really late, he was in the shelter and he had missed his bed. And so you know, I was talking to him and I just thinking oh how awful it was all be fine i'll be fine and so hung up and I thought, why didn't I offer to get him a hotel room that night. So I called him the next day and i've heard is maybe why called see if I would you know pick up on it and say, let me get your tail, and so my mother was helping him again, but he he is in the shelter she wants me to be in the shelter for a while. my sister was in a homeless shelter for two years until she got her own home utah has a wonderful program for that. hmm I think it's a really good example of just how. The problem of poverty and dysfunction and addictions my my father didn't drink or take any drugs, my father or my mother, did we didn't have that problem we had the abuse and just about everybody in my family has suffered you know my father, he was the only one that my grandmother. didn't treat the way she should have and he was wasn't financially successful all of the others one was the CEO of an oil company he hasn't one was the university professor. The other one was a general contractor, they were all really successful except for my father, and in my family, the only. The only in the immediate family you've got kids and grandchildren, the only grandchild that ever turned out to have middle class life was my sister's daughter, who was she is her daughter was adopted at birth. And she's fine she you know she was raised by wealthy parents advantaged and she's probably the most successful all the grandchildren. And I could get I think that's one of the things that when I started going from conservative. Liberal, I was really a staunch conservative. Just how pernicious already and."
760.0,Provider,"yeah because it sets the way kind of going back to it sets the way we think about ourselves, so if your father. Was not treated properly. Then oftentimes people in that situation feel less than they feel and capable and so you know we talked to so they don't see the opportunities. They don't see the things they need to do, and it just. continues and then you know. And then he has kids and makes. Mistakes like horrendous mistakes that cause suffering and it's just kind of like a cycle. yeah so yeah you're right so that's that's. that's the beauty of the healing to to to because you can't control what was done to you in childhood. And you can't control what the mistakes, you made previously, when you were younger, but here today, you know, speaking about mindfulness being here in the moment, right now, today, you can work on yourself and be a better version of you. You know, and then, when you slip you just remind yourself i'm still learning to be a better version of you. And you learn from those mistakes."
16506.0,Patient,"As long as possible. And there was a time I really did think that i'm just not going to be any further than I am now i'm at my desk I just got to accept it. And I know why I don't feel that way, I felt it for a long time, and I, you know I think October 23 was the time when I really thought no I can really have. A different life, and it was it was just before that that I started looking at at my life from when I first started studying. philosophy and psychology and was part of the professional group discussing these issues. And I didn't realize the long time i've been picking up all of these ideas and internalizing them without even realizing it. And so just just before that that I was getting ready to tell you, whatever is going to be was gonna be my therapist but. i'm starting to see things now that I didn't realize before and how far I have come and how far I could be dumb and 23rd seemed to be the nail on the head that I woke up with a different point of view, now, it was Romania, but which is powerful dahlia it's opiates or alcohol. I don't know if you've ever experienced mania but Superman fits really good maybe."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16506.0,Patient,it's good you just think nothing can go wrong and.
760.0,Provider,everything's always going to be wonderful.
16506.0,Patient,"Oh yeah mania but and I don't mind me, I mean obviously don't mind it in the moment. But it, you know if it turns into a little bit of frustration and just a little bit of depression, I don't mind it it's when. And it seems like when I i've had really deep manic episodes that I fall back the farthest and and it seemed like I guess, since I was manic for five six weeks, which I didn't even know was possible. That you know, there was like a reckoning come do, and I think I went through that beginning two weeks ago. I got through it i'm certainly not as bad as I was, I feel a lot better right now. yeah so but yeah I do mania is wonderful, but it often leads."
760.0,Provider,"To bad things yeah when with this, you know, life is about. Extreme extremes, is the right word but. opposites. it's like. You know, we with the happiness comes the sadness. You know so just kind of seems like that's a, for whatever reason, and truthfully I think it's through the the difficulty that we have the opportunity, should we take it to grow and heal and and, as you discussed with maslow's hierarchy of needs that self actualization. You have that opportunity to reach towards that a little bit more. Because I do notice when people don't have things that they struggle with sometimes we get kind of complacent and. We just uncomfortable and we just sit there, so perhaps that's one thing you can say you can. feel grateful for the all the different lessons that you've learned and. That wouldn't have been possible without. You know my father used to tell me, you are the sum of. All your experiences good bad and otherwise. And so you know. Being grateful for. What you've learned and what you've attained is is. is an important part, and you could tell yourself that. When you're when you're struggling with the depression."
16506.0,Patient,And the lower moments in.
760.0,Provider,Your life.
16506.0,Patient,I percent.
760.0,Provider,"So. That would just be one one way to look at it, one other coping skill and this is going to pass and this gets better and and then you will."
16506.0,Patient,"is okay, if I share with you one more quote."
760.0,Provider,Sure sure.
16506.0,Patient,"I believe it was a Hindu. But it was. back. About 300 years before Christ, and he said that happiness or his term which was more like marijuana was a neutral sense of well being is an empty cup that was once filled with sorrow suffering and greed. and But it's also an empty cup that once held joy Ecstasy pleasure, and it will again. which goes really well with the Buddhist version of the one you know we hedonist people who think that they're going to have a great life by. Lots of sex, so now with all access. Most of them. Have unhappy lives."
760.0,Provider,"that's because what they're doing is they're they're running from they're using that compulsive behavior that compulsive drinking or sex whatever it is, and trying to cover something up and we can't can't run away from ourselves, we can't run away from our suffering. We have you know we have to give ourselves the space and time to process what we feel about that in a safe place in a safe way. Not in a destructive way. And then it can get better. So."
16506.0,Patient,"Thank you, thank you very much."
760.0,Provider,"Oh, he seemed to be coming a long way."
16506.0,Patient,"Well, thank you, I appreciate that."
760.0,Provider,"I do want to submit one suggestion to you if you don't mind. Try. Some simple mindfulness adding to your morning routine. Like be in the moment of just just a little mind exercise, if you will, like when you're making your bed. you're you're going to be in the moment, making the bed you're going to notice the touch of the sheets in the blankets and the pillows. you're going to you just use the concept of mindfulness as you're doing the morning routine that I know it's already working for you had that little bit."
16506.0,Patient,"I hadn't thought of that you know I kind of I used to do that when I would put myself asleep would be to be in the moment and concentrate on the feelings of the sheets and everything. I had never thought I could I could do that to my morning, yes, wonderful Thank you."
760.0,Provider,"A lot of people think mindfulness Oh, I have to sit and meditate and meditation is a really good way to practice mindfulness, but you can also add it to the other parts of your day."
16506.0,Patient,I will.
760.0,Provider,"You know it, you know, make a make a mind exercise out of it and just anything that you're doing that's constructive unhealthy, you know even mine, I mean i've even got some books that described like mindful eating, you know eat an orange and and be mindful, with the."
16506.0,Patient,way the sweetness or a lemon you know what whatever it is an.
760.0,Provider,"Eating whatever but probably make it healthy but. You know those kinds of things. So just start to look for little ways to incorporate it you don't have to be complicated so much. Because mindfulness is a practice and it starts out usually going to start out. Small because we're not used to thinking that way, so the more you can remember to do it, I think that will further you along even more."
16506.0,Patient,"I think that's wonderful I think a lot of times now, now that you said that and I understand a little bit more about that we do often put ourselves on autopilot. And I don't know if you saw that Adam sandler movie about click it but they had a fast. Yes, yes. Yes, so he missed a lot of his life, and I really internalize that and I do believe, a lot of times. You know i'm i'm sorry that I reference code or use cultural references."
760.0,Provider,Within know that that you. This is how you relate it's descriptive um and.
16506.0,Patient,Then I think.
760.0,Provider,ideas and it's it yeah it helps you process and helps me understand so you're good.
16506.0,Patient,"Okay, so this was and I don't have the exact quote it does a number of manic spam just thinking about the whole package I don't know if you read any bukowski."
760.0,Provider,know.
16506.0,Patient,If you don't don't do a drunk.
760.0,Provider,"No, I don't think so."
16506.0,Patient,"feel depressed the hell, it is so we'll need che. He can his later works were much less depressing, but he talks about the thing that he notices he sees the world around him people in the world as zombies going through that rat race not realizing not thinking that they're part of this society and how they're contributing. And so i'm I, and this is great, because this is how I catalog my ideas and connect them further ideas and what you said is really. wrong because sometimes we know things we just don't internalize and the serenity prayer i'm not in my whole life and it wasn't until I actually was at the point where i'm like okay. i'm at my very worst. I have to change the things that I can and accept those things. Forgive me for being emotional, but this has been a."
760.0,Provider,"Little that's good you're you're. Processing that's good. Thanks good you don't have to say, forgive me, as you know. you're supposed to process your emotions here, whatever they may be, as long as you're doing it in a an assertive way you're good. Good so don't worry. yeah well you're awesome to your your your processing really well and I kind of want you kind of made me think too like there was a. symbolism for healing is like recovery and healing is kind of like an onion. You start with this big outer layer and then you kind of peel away a little bit at a time, and you get to deeper understandings, especially when you're philosophical and a deep thinker, I think that can be really helpful."
16506.0,Patient,I love metaphor and that's a beautiful one.
