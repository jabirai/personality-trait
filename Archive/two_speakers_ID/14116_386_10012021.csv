386.0,Provider,"And then, how about the adderall when's the last time you utilize that medication today, and then I only have the last dose today so i'm just that half remaining okay. And I currently have you utilizing the adderall it's 20 milligrams at one and a half per day total. So one in the morning and a half in the afternoon, yes okay. um any I know it's odd question any symptoms of withdrawal from any of these medication or side effects and know. Any recent relapse on any use of opioids. Any recent relapse on any other illicit substances know. And are you currently feel like you would that be considered to be suicidal no. You don't plan on harming anybody else as well know. Her already so i'm reviewing your chart what it looks like here is they have you enrolled in the program for opioid use disorder, but they do have the notation that. bright heart health is providing medication management, treatment and psych meds only for you and so. With That said, we have the notation to not schedule for group therapy individual therapy drug screening and then reaching out to the care manager regarding any type of lab orders or results for like urine drug screening or anything like that, so there is high. It looks like you're highly being followed here and so Sharon sets is the nurse practitioner in charge of your particular case were you able to complete out all of your surveys that the triage department would have ended up wanting you to complete out a perfect okay. Just pulled it up real quick here that we make that notation. Perfect it looks like here I got the band seven and the questionnaire the electronic technology questionnaire the pH humanized so and the looks like you also completed out the compliance video questionnaire, so thank you for that. Right now, because your last appointment was was on the first of Sep Sep tember it's been over 30 it's been at that 30 day mark, where we would. reasonably say, are we going to continue treatment or we're going to discharge and so. What i'm going to do is i'm going to send the message over to I know you have an appointment lined up on the 14th for a MED follow up. With Sharon sets nurse practitioner, and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to send a message over to Sharon and requesting for the medication renewal, to get done for you, for all three of these medications letting her know that you're where you're at and dosing. And so what she'll do is she will follow up with you in regards to either send the prescription over and asked me to follow up with you or she'll follow up with you personally just let you know the scripts have been sent in, and I have your phone number at 949-427-1887 Is that correct. Just like so bad, with the phone numbers I don't blame me, I am too, I think it changed the hallway no that's not right here."
14116.0,Patient,"Oh yeah it did change, so the my phone number can we update it."
386.0,Provider,"You got it updated from number on both profiles that we have here for ya. Let me get a message sent over to Sharon stats and then what because it is 1130 1140 I should have received some type of notification back within three hours time. And so I should be able to get back to you and i'll call you on your phone and to let you know that your prescriptions been sent to me okay um I didn't realize how low I was running and just like God really under the weather this. And, but I definitely like want to stay with her, I don't with you, having a follow up already scheduled, I do not think discharge is even in mind right now i'm just so to peace of mind. It just what I do highly recommend is just making sure because right now I believe what let me look at the last note here. So with sharing um there was just a missed appointment, but with. That said, so when she did the agent p. See how often she wanted to see ya. She most likely is going to want to see you at least, I would say, probably minimum of twice a month just about every 15 days, just to just to make sure that everything has stabilized okay. But other than that, I mean it's been it's been 40 days since they did your care intensity and so and that's where it says current medical appointment frequency is twice a month, and then it says current group is none, and then individual therapy is being managed outside of. Outside with an outside provider, so you should be good to go I don't foresee there being any issues, let me get a message over to her, and then I will reach back out to you, once we have some type of directive okay much I really appreciate it absolutely not a problem. Sorry i'm sorry you're calling the phone yep i'm going to give you a phone call on that on that telephone number that you just provided I have 94987639001. And I will give you a phone call back once I have some type of directive from her wonderful Thank you so much, I really appreciate it absolutely not a problem best of luck for you, and then I will speak to you shortly."
