528.0,Provider,"So what do you want to start with today, I know, last time we focus a lot on the history and you did a great job of telling me about all that so. And I know I think we said you were gonna try to increase your insurance week. So yeah tell me how that one I guess."
8267.0,Patient,"I could not do that, so we were talking about having an issue with the nights before I go to work. yeah and the days that I didn't have four meals. The thing is, I couldn't do it, I tried at once, but I wake up like an hour and a half or an hour before my work. Near my house, so I have, I have a tea. Before I go to work. i'm traditional TV so it's not it's it's caffeine, so how I get my energy, but you still keep like you have some tea, but you keep adding water whenever you're done. So I was having my tea, as every morning, and when I was done, I had the nuts and the insurance and they're all at this team like less than an hour and maybe not. I could not breathe and in like my stomach started hurting because I had the tna had then surely had the nuts in less than one hour and It made me uncomfortable at work. And I couldn't do it, but I increase my NUTS intake like I started having like a very like good amount of notes and they started like also adding notes to other meals. I just created myself, and I am I wait 112 and then I know I didn't gain to bounce. Back but it's still like better than going down. As three times I was losing weight that I started with one with 112, then I went down to 1110, and this is like the first time I actually went myself and i'm."
528.0,Provider,so glad.
8267.0,Patient,time I weighed myself would give me. more accurate measurement if I gained any weight. yeah um but yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so can you just go through. What your day looks like now that you've made some changes so just tell me what you had yesterday as an example."
8267.0,Patient,"Yesterday had work, so I woke up and I had a good ball, with some pistachios some characters some hazel Nice and some. chestnuts i'm not sure if i'm pronouncing this right, so it was a good amount of nights like very good, so I had them all and. I want to work, I had to ensure."

8267.0,Patient,"And I have to ensure. As my lunchtime, and when I got home, I had a flatter route. And I usually have them with with some cucumbers and some prunes and some nuts. Okay, and my last meal was. In green. With. nectarines. And with set with with also like. Some pretzels that like peanut butter pretzels and a whole granola bar."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so you had the NUTS i'm Sorry, I want to go back, but like the first like handful of nuts that you had with the insurer was around what time in the day."
8267.0,Patient,i'm 3945.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, and then you had the ensure around what time. OK, and then in between you didn't have anything that was Is that correct Okay, and then, when did you have the floor floor up."

528.0,Provider,"Okay anything else. Okay, how about to drink, besides the tea."
8267.0,Patient,Just water.
528.0,Provider,"Just water okay. Okay, so that you've been doing, like, for the past week or so."
8267.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"mm hmm Okay, and tell me about like he said you were eating the nuts and ensuring you couldn't breathe like do you mean that you were like really fall is that is that why you can breathe or tell me more about that."
8267.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, in general, I do have shortness of breath I just struggle with breathing but um whenever I eat. But this time, the other day I couldn't read because I had a lot of things, I was very fun."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so that was after eating like tell me exactly what you had."
8267.0,Patient,"I had the team. And I had the nurse, and I have to ensure. Okay they're very different like the tea is kind of better and doesn't have any sugar. And I have like some a lot of because I cannot wake up, without it, and to ensure is usually made me sick I don't enjoy it or I don't enjoy it after me because it doesn't make me feel good I. don't like it, so I believe, like the tea and to ensure, at the same half hour, it was just kind of made me nauseous it's. better than being physically fit. about it they're good taste wise just was good."
528.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. All right, um So what do you want to focus on today i'm curious."
8267.0,Patient,"I. Honestly, have no idea, so I did not get a chance to do the blood work I said. i'm trying to do it next week, the thing is, I only have two days without work, and there was day and Mondays. And under and these two days I have classes between 1230 and 330. And so it's not a matter and do a do not have a flexible schedule, because probably before and after I have appointments with you guys, because my only window so i'm trying to get the appointment, but it's not that easy some. Another week or something. yeah."
528.0,Provider,"All right, and then I know I mentioned going to get. A door, I just want to remind you i'm assuming you haven't done this yet, but like just to get that maybe see like a gastroenterologist you know."
8267.0,Patient,yeah today I today I have an appointment that for with my case manager as course she's going to help me transfer my my. My callback so I can start seeing a doctor.
528.0,Provider,Oh great okay.
8267.0,Patient,about having some difficulties during that too. as well.
528.0,Provider,i'm okay. Sorry.
8267.0,Patient,And I still haven't haven't gotten my brilliant.
528.0,Provider,"Well that's gonna come a time, I think you know with. You know I think what we can focus on right now is improving your nutrition, you know, with time with your weight regain and getting better nutrition your period should probably come back. So, would you want to talk about that today."
8267.0,Patient,And I honestly I would rather see what you what you think I should focus on and i'm not sure really last. I don't know.
528.0,Provider,"yeah Well, I do think we should focus on improving your nutrition, which means like basically increasing your intake right because you're not going to gain weight or get your period back without more energy right so that's how your body functions like. You know, right now, your body's prioritizing keeping your heart beating keeping your lungs working your brain like. Right and so it's not prioritizing your reproductive system right so in order for there to be enough, energy, so you do get your period back. it's going to take repeating basically or renourishment okay um which you're familiar with, if I recall right because you you mean a few months ago, you were eating more food or were you eating much more food or like it was about the same or is."
8267.0,Patient,"It the same it was the same since I started the real i've been having. The maximum think i'm, not increase it more, but before I moved here, I was at a stable weight and my period was okay. which took a lot of time, I mean it took me. Eight months to gain like. Nine or eight pounds."
528.0,Provider,yeah yeah okay well good sorry.
8267.0,Patient,"Oh yeah so right now, like i'm taking i'm eating a lot, like, I know that i'm eating a lot I would. be like more than happy to start taking pictures of my meal or something i'm not sure like i'm not sure how to increase my intake more than this it's."
528.0,Provider,"All right, well, we can talk about that I don't think I think that there's definitely room for improvement, you know because. Your breakfast is basically like a handful of nuts and accountable ensure okay so um and then you're in lunch is just a bottle wait so you're doing to ensure the day or one. One okay so actually, then I I so it's actually just the nuts in the morning right and not that i'm not okay. My mistake okay so NUTS a handful of nuts is not really considered a breakfast it's it's more like a snack I would say. So we could talk about ways to you know add more to your plate, you know more to your breakfast if that would be okay. If you're having well yeah so that's one thing and then same with lunch, you know, a can of ensure and I don't know if you get do you get the regular ensures that the like plus ensure plus Okay, so I forgot, I think that has maybe. 300 calories or something right. yeah so um you know again that's not really going to be enough for a meal, so we I would definitely recommend we talk about adding things to that as well. And then you know I mean it seems to me you're having like kind of one like actual meal a day like the meat of the falafel wrap with the cucumbers and the. Like prunes and not like that looks like a like a like a meal to me Okay, because you've got some you have a variety of fruits and vegetables, you have. Some fats, you have protein, you have everything so that's like that's what we want to go for like you know at least three times a day is something that looks like that. Where there's more food at the at the meal um so I mean I don't know I can show you what Just to give you an example, would it be helpful to look that."
8267.0,Patient,"up. I mean yeah i'm mostly pretty familiar with them. I was just like my schedule was this because I couldn't do more. For like my third meal I wouldn't be hungry at all, it would be like i'm very full after when I used to eat like three times within sure so whenever I don't have school I would eat a meal at my breakfast like right now, for example, I had. two pieces of bread with feta cheese and peanut butter and I had with that fruit, as some foods, but um and some prunes. But when I used to when I use what I used to do that my third meal, I would have I wouldn't be hungry, or would be very full after one insurance two meals, so the only thing was possible for me to eat was. Was the snacks that i'm having. I mean, maybe I can add some. Some oatmeal at my last meal, but I cannot look at a real food if that's if that's very. I mean, I know that the breakfast I can try to eat some peanut butter with the NUTS um I do not have the time to eat full meal, because I do have I do. need a lot of time to eat unfortunately i'll add I mean I increase the NUTS that i'm having, but I also will add maybe some bread with peanut butter and, like, I think I can do that's pretty. um but for my second meal at work. I wouldn't be able to have anything other than ensure because I do where prices. and to eat I need to take them off and eat and brush my teeth and they only have 30 minutes lunch. Okay, and makes it very difficult for me to do that. So me, maybe adding the oatmeal at my last meal or. Not or and adding the peanut butter at my purpose that be something that."
528.0,Provider,"would get that's definitely I mean that's. that's steps in the right direction for sure you know yeah and and when I say all this, you know I want to be super clear that you know it's not like you have to do all this by next week, you know so even just adding. I think that sounds like a good plan, if you can just add the peanut butter on the bread breakfast and then add the. oatmeal and when you say the last meal, did you mean the meal look at."
8267.0,Patient,145 yeah.
528.0,Provider,yeah so I mean any addition to what you're currently doing will be helpful absolutely you know.
8267.0,Patient,"I mean it's very it's very hard, because I wake up every day at 9am and I work almost like nine hours, and when I get home to to have my main lunch, you know, the only like the only proper meal that I can get. I would want it, I can't eat before like four or five hours, because that would be pretty full, so I would have to stay up to like to eat and eat. Which. sucks but right now I mean i'm gonna i'm dealing with this so probably that also I mean being. Like waking up nine til 2am every day it's not like the healthiest thing for me to do but also like the only thing that I can do to eat and my mom that's another thing my mom is sending me food. And these two days, so I will be having. Different for them falafel rabbits are probably going to be high on salaries and mobile ad and more protein. yeah that's that."
528.0,Provider,"yeah so wait, I just want to understand this a little bit better. So you're saying that you stay up like till two in the morning, just so you can eat your meal is that is that did I hear that right."
8267.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I try to eat it by like 1232 one. Okay cuz I usually have my my meal after I get from more and if i'm closing that would be at 830 and I would finish at nine or if i'm not closing I would that would be at 730 and like we've done at eight. times I do need at least four hours to eat the amount that I eat at night. which will, which makes me see have more than I want to stay up definitely."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
8267.0,Patient,I would be. would be done with my eating around like 30. Every day.
528.0,Provider,"For him, would you want to go to bed, if you could."
8267.0,Patient,If I could I would want it around 12.
528.0,Provider,"That would be the ideal time for you to go to bed, but you're kind of staying up because you feel like you have to eat another meal. yeah okay. um I wonder if we could maybe think about other ways that you can do that, because your sleep is really important to. You know and. um, and so I wonder if there's I don't know. I mean, I get I understand that you're like work schedule, it sounds like you work eight hours or nine hours and like you got a half an hour break. You have the issue you know the concern with the braces. What else can we come up with because. I don't know I part of me just feels like that that seems you know, like it's you I guess you're choosing, it seems like you're choosing you know food oversleep but they're both important So how could we kind of. help you to get both of what you need."
8267.0,Patient,"yeah this is, I guess, this is my question."
528.0,Provider,"um. I mean, is there, is it possible for you to ask your work, or like talk to them about you know kind of what your maybe you don't have to tell them everything, but you know, maybe request a longer lunch break like an hour."
8267.0,Patient,"Oh, actually, I was the 30 minutes break, so I can get 30 minutes earlier. um for me, I do not have time. And my day I do need the 30 minutes. And I would want to work around everything around my breakfast and the last two meals, other than working on adding something during my work, because I do not like eating at work. To be honest. I would be more flexible to do things around the ensure at work, and I would add things. or whatever, but at work, I I honestly feel very comfortable doing what i'm doing right now and I wouldn't want to eat at work."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, what tell me more about that."
8267.0,Patient,"Well, because I usually at work. i'm pretty quiet person comparison, so I work at among so usually out my lunch, I would go down to my car and just relax for a little bit and and I have my ensure there. and Honestly, like taken off and on the prices and eating it's just a lot of time and I just want to rely on my lunch and I usually after food I I don't feel so comfortable. I do not like, for example, because of my shirt is a further because I don't know because of my. overgrowth bacteria or whatever, that is, I would feel the need to burn consistently after I eat which. Well, not shouldn't worry about fashion it's not something that I want to do when i'm out, and I do not feel the best after I eat and it is stressful and does give me an existing and I don't feel the best after it, to be honest."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so you you feel like you're in a verb that like your does your stomach feel blow, are you bloated Is that what you mean or."
8267.0,Patient,i'm floated too young.
528.0,Provider,"So okay so but but um I guess what i'm thinking of is, if you had a longer lunch break like. You know that would give you more time to eat something else, this is just i'm just talking about this i'm not saying you have to do this, but like. You know let's say you had an hour, then you can eat a little bit more food at lunch, you know, along with the ensure and then have time to like relax and brush your teeth. So that's one thing, maybe or the other thing is. Like What if you were to have another ensure at some point during your work shift."
8267.0,Patient,So I would be having the breakfast which is nuts and peanut butter and ensure another ensure and another meal and another meal.
528.0,Provider,"So you would do the nuts and the NUTS or peanut butter and. And bread and then. You would have basically you'd go to work and spend some at some like. cuz you're gonna work a long time, too, and that's The other thing is you, you know really your body needs fuel during that time. More than what you're giving it so, but if you were to do to ensure that work. Rather than just one and then come home and have your regular meal that you've been doing and then have you know, like we talked about i'm just trying to figure out a way for you to get a little more food in like during the day. And then I mean we could even talk about the possibility and this might be a lot of changes, so we can kind of space this out over time if if this even sounds good, to you, but. You know, we can kind of shift like that last meal, because I think if you're eating, even if you haven't ensure during the day, and maybe have a bigger like meal, when you come home at 830. That could kind of make up for what you're eating like at 12 one one o'clock in the morning and then that way, if you wanted to go to bed earlier you wouldn't feel like you had to stay up to eat type of thing does does that make sense."
8267.0,Patient,"It does, but I do retry maximum when i'm eating my meal after yeah. I do not think it's possible for me to eat more. And I could try having to ensures the day. But I cannot eat more of my second my my main meal. Not."
528.0,Provider,"So um I mean, and again I realized that it could be a lot of changes I mean it sounds like you're willing to at least add the peanut butter and the. tone and the bread in the morning and then you think you could add like oatmeal at night right and then even like a third or like a second ensure during the day, does that feel like something or like do you want to try to do all those things."
8267.0,Patient,"Oh, all of them together, I mean. If I eat I eat like, if I have another ensure during the day I still need to have them oatmeal and my last meal."
528.0,Provider,"You know I would say, we could just leave it off for now let's just try those two changes because that that is I mean that is. Like three changes, you know so i'm Okay, with just doing two of those So if you want to try to ensure during the day and bread, with the peanut butter and then just keep everything else, the same, we could, I think that would be fine."
8267.0,Patient,yeah yeah. I think we can do that.
528.0,Provider,"Okay perfect. What he is there anything that you feel, can you imagine anything that might be hard about doing that."
8267.0,Patient,honestly. Everything is gonna be hard about doing this. And i'll do it.
528.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay um i'm. All right, anything else. You did mention that you you'd be you you're open to taking pictures I think that's what I heard you say, if you want to do that, I think that would be a great idea to. um there's actually In fact I didn't get a chance to talk to you about it last time, but are you familiar with recovery record, do you know. Okay, so um. I use this with all my patients and basically it's an APP that you can just download on your phone and it's free and. You can actually track your food there like but it's you know there's no numbers it's not about calories or anything like that it's just you can either take pictures and upload it to the APP or you can also list what you ate. It also gives you I mean it's actually a really great tool for you to kind of check in with feelings and thoughts and how your body feels and things like that. You don't have to do any of that if you just want to upload the picture there that i'm fine with that and then you know, with time, we can kind of explore some of the other parts of that um but the good thing about that too is that you know we can actually link together so. I cannot hear your pictures, you know, without you having to send it to me or anything like that it's pretty easy."
8267.0,Patient,it's called recovery records. Okay i'll download that that's awesome.
528.0,Provider,"yeah and I can give you i'll give you my code so. it's like a five digit number. And when you're ready, I can give it to you."
8267.0,Patient,"um i'm ready. Okay 657-946-5794. Yes, okay perfect."
528.0,Provider,"So that will just once, I once you there's a place that gets usually at the bottom, it says like connect clint excuse me connect it to clinician if you click that it will say what's your clinicians name or number and then that's the type that in and then we'll be connected."
8267.0,Patient,"I like that um. If we if we are. Like a for enough today is that okay to finish the session earlier, I."
528.0,Provider,"yeah that's no problem um, let me say next week. I don't have any I know you said Wednesday is. Is that the only day you can do."
8267.0,Patient,"I mean, I do have Mondays as well i'm assuming that you don't work on Sundays."
528.0,Provider,yeah no.
8267.0,Patient,No. it's either Monday or Wednesday.
528.0,Provider,You want to try Monday at one.

8267.0,Patient,"Is it possible to schedule another appointment for the following week, so it can be later than nine because, like Wednesday is my only day that I might get a little more sleep than I usually. Maybe, like, for the following week if that's possible."
528.0,Provider,"yeah sorry right like after September my wednesday's won't be as crazy, I have a training in the afternoon that's why so it's like all my appointments are but um but yeah we can go ahead and book the 29th and and just do want to do 11 o'clock. On the 29."
