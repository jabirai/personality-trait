323.0,Provider,Individual session with selena craver began. hi.
5075.0,Patient,How are you.
323.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you today."
5075.0,Patient,"And i'm good burning up, but just now, like a goofball all day long the neighbor across the road has. He he had a big tree and as middle of this front yard. yeah so he was having it professionally removed. They started it, I think, seven o'clock this morning, and it was loud, so I got up. wow like a dummy I listened to this all day coming in my windows. And they just left a little bit ago and. The this huge i'm talking huge. log that they took down when rolling. And they had part the way they parked or truck. If they're it hit a. Light pole a big cake my cable and electric pole. Oh, and it split it in the middle it didn't break it completely down but it split it in the middle and if. That if it hadn't hit that and their truck had been sitting there, it would have been in my front yard literally. yeah his whole yard is is down the Hill, I mean literally. So no sooner than name left the electric whole company came. And I was like well i'm burning up I gotta turn my oven on because i'm working on Christmas crafts and I found a new cramped and I wanted to try and i've got a big get up and now."
323.0,Provider,Now you're facing.
5075.0,Patient,"Reality why usually always do like if, during my fabric ones and stuff when I put my coffee mixture like my coffee and vanilla I usually brush that on, and then I end up putting it in the oven for like 15 minutes."
323.0,Provider,Either yeah yeah.
5075.0,Patient,"i'm burning up and I dry it that way, and then it gets it a. more of an age, I get. A look so I seen this lady I actually sold a couple sets of my pumpkin and candy corn. things and not really boosted my spirits a lot so she said, I told her, I was getting ready to start my Christmas crafts and she was like please send me pictures when you do. And I said Okay, I said, what do you kind of like and she said dumb I do usually snowman so I already had some pretty cute remnant of like snowman excuse now I my teeth, then I had one single tooth right here. That was loose and all my gosh yesterday they told me to login that compliance and I I couldn't even get to it because I couldn't talk it every time I talked it was so lose it would hit my lips would hit the tooth while Finally, thank God it come out yesterday."
323.0,Provider,Oh wow.
5075.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I didn't put my my plate my. tenure at temporary, but my partials. In but anyways I seen this lady make what she called a rustic primitive rusty rustic snowman hat and instead of using stiffener she mixes. One thing of the small helmers glue and one waters, you know it's one in one and then she adds a copy next year to it, and she dips her material in it like like i've got some friends. made here, and once I Benes the hat part get them so, then you mix it you put it now and bring it out real good and then you put it in an oven you stop them with oil, so they don't flat. And you stop them and you bake them when and then, when they're done they're still there, you know, instead of using that expensive stiffener that's I guess the whole home remedy of how to make things still. wow. So i'm going on yeah I know I didn't know that so i'm working on a couple of snowman hats and then i've got one set of little preeminence now man, I still got a pain on with my coffee mixture, and all that, so I got got to get them done but."
323.0,Provider,The idea is thanksgiving.
5075.0,Patient,"I sold yeah making anything for. thanksgiving other than my fall pumpkins and south. mm hmm so pretty much so that's what they use, do you know, and I didn't really decorate for like Halloween this year I just done my one primitive tree. And I made a witch's hat for it and some other little things that's all I put on it, and then, when that comes off cool i'll put my ball step back on it and till almost November, then all decorated in my Christmas. A song a couple sets of my Halloween stuff and then are not calling fall pumpkins."
323.0,Provider,yeah you showed me was pretty cool.
5075.0,Patient,"yeah and then she wanted why sold her the three square foot scarecrow heads and I had made, I think I showed you those. yeah and she wanted a larger. So, with the three small one, so I work two days. And made her a bigger one, and she got it yesterday, and she texts rpm to me, and she was like I got my package, she was like I absolutely love it. Good so. But so far, she was my only buyer but you know."
323.0,Provider,You got somewhere. Here yeah.
5075.0,Patient,"If they don't sell i'll have them already ready ready for next year. Right and that's why i'm starting now on Christmas because honestly I got started a little late you really want to get them priced and out there before people even start putting it out. That way they see it, they buy it because they know they're going to be decorated."
323.0,Provider,My room already stuff out in the stores.
5075.0,Patient,All I know.
323.0,Provider,Even get for Halloween and stuff is on the.
5075.0,Patient,"dollar tree he's got Christmas stuff. out already cousin I seen her do this little lady that done the snowman has she done a Santa hat and it was really cute and. She put it on a. Excuse me, she stopped it and then she put it, a bottom cut out a circle and put on the bottom, but she started on a kindle stakeholder and that was really cute so. i'm waiting for the dollar tree to put out. Some of the Santa hat, so I can grab a couple of them to redo and you know decorate so but and. Athens bound, it said you're burning up all day and I thought Why am I doing this when i've got. It all right. I gotta turn the air on that closed on windows down, I was like I ain't sweat no more because I got turned on actual I oh."
323.0,Provider,yeah that would make it way too hot too.
5075.0,Patient,"Exactly but i'm actually grew blank good. I think, Dr sell over wrote down again."
323.0,Provider,"She was going to go in and change it, because she had the saving ability. To be changed in the chart I told her I couldn't I could put it in but it wouldn't save so she said she was going to do it for us, so I hope."
5075.0,Patient,"Well, I think that she tried, but it wouldn't let her either so yeah but she said that it was documented very well."
323.0,Provider,She yeah cuz I wrote it and i'm sure she wrote it and hopefully they're reading the notes.
5075.0,Patient,yeah and then they reach out to me about my insurance which. They can really tell me anything and I understand because i'm not actually. On medicare yet.
323.0,Provider,Right.
5075.0,Patient,"And I think what i'm going to do is not reach out to medicare Come on, I absolutely know, I have to, which is what 62 or 60 whatever it is. Right, so I think i'll just kind of leave things as is because nobody's ever said anything to me so security's number right out and said hey you need to be you know signing up for medicare. Right job and families never said to me hey you need to sign up for medicare and I just literally done my medicaid recertification, so I think that if it was if it was mandatory they would have already said, some. To Ray like hey you need to sign up for this, and nobody so bad when I told the little girl when I logged into birch wines like well I said why don't we just leave it alone, for now, because nothing's actually changed, excuse me, and I had united healthcare for. Several years now, and I don't plan on changing you know my carriers, so I said we'll just kind of leave it alone, for now, and you know go just leave it alone, and she said okay so that's kind of what we're going to do."
323.0,Provider,"um it's interesting since we last talked i've been seeing more and more commercials about the settlement, like the trials that are going on."
5075.0,Patient,"Have you I see, I have it."
323.0,Provider,Where I didn't see him before we have that. You don't know you're in attention but it wouldn't hit me because that's the population I work with but.
5075.0,Patient,"Have you ever notice if you're on Facebook. OK let's say you're on Google. And you are Amazon, and you Google. 32 inch tire. And then, when you get back on Facebook. All the comments yeah."
323.0,Provider,"i'm going to tell you something a little bit even scarier than that that i've noticed. Well i'm having a conversation about something like we were talking about flying like to Arizona or something, and all of a sudden, I got on Facebook and there were ads about flying I was talking, I was searching on my phone."
5075.0,Patient,Okay i'm looking right.
323.0,Provider,"Listening to you and I believe that, with all my heart, and I believe it's apple."

323.0,Provider,The group smaller.
5075.0,Patient,"yeah it seems to be a little bit smaller yeah. Which is no big you know but. It does seem to be you know, like. And I can see. Someone literally. Every time you seen him alive, he knew, you know you knew they were like telling lies like crazy. and"
323.0,Provider,"1212 not all about that you know, after a while if you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing she's like you need a higher level of care were discharging."
5075.0,Patient,"dad oh exactly he. likes to keep pretty small so. yeah well that's what I was going to say because. They had talked about that you know, said that we lost some, you know as much as we read, write it, you know, we had to put them in a higher care. Because there was a Mexican girl I forget her first name every time she was on there was online got my drug screen all day send it here, or they sent, and this was every flippin nine, but then to turn around and ask about. Well, when, am I going to get. yeah my face and my drift, you know what. I don't have to go back for so maybe I am thinking. Are you serious you just ask them. Do what you're supposed to do and it will happen. But I seen that quite a bit, so I knew we were going to log lose several on those ones are gone so, but you know if you're not serious about it. How hard is this program yeah there's times I don't feel like logging on. yeah but. I don't have to leave my house."
323.0,Provider,I mean it can't be any easier than.
5075.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean exactly I go to the pharmacy you want to mind now on every three months on drug screening um I just gotta log in four times a month, you know. Right, even if it is a bad. mom and my dad."
323.0,Provider,The biggest problem is remembering now.
5075.0,Patient,yeah that's my issue that's. that's the true. yeah but i'm doing better because you know i've been writing down in here and then also with a new iPhone.
323.0,Provider,Suddenly alarm or.
5075.0,Patient,"My I want my. Watch my apple watch. yeah it'll go off on my own and where i'm at now and they miss it on my phone. Right, but I know when it goes off on my watch yeah Oh, I see it, so I know to grab this and I wouldn't see what's going on, but I don't understand you know. A mother that just blatantly. Not doing what you're supposed to be doing but. Because even when I first started my recovery, and I was going to heal a place called healing heart. yeah there. I was, I was happening to me there four to five days. A week."
323.0,Provider,Later walk about the long waits.
5075.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, I was in there one day, one day, eight hours. Getting my script. Literally. Eight hours, and then I had to do nine hours of op or whatever that's called repo whatever it's called."
323.0,Provider,yeah i'll patient yeah.
5075.0,Patient,"I had to do nine hours, so that was three hours that evening. three nights a week. Then they weren't allowed to schedule doctor visits on the day. So that made it for days and then normally. If you have counseling that night that took up the day. Right, and you know that was quite much you know, especially. For people who didn't have transportation, or whatever that I can see where that would be really hard. But that was in the beginning of of my alcohol recovery, I guess, I should say cuz i'd already been long done with drug the drug part of it, so it was my alcohol part, so, in all honesty, yes, that helped me. Because it kept me accountable. eat fray and I needed that for for in the beginning. But after about eight months of that, as I know, or you know. And plus. I got thought said during one of the meetings one night and I don't remember now what happened. i'm done I left there and bought a six pack and. Gone long during it. that's when I made my decision then. i'm done with that place because. We found out that the owner His name was the one and he was married to major which was this why but I I had been hearing rumors that he was. approaching people and giving them money at the go get him crack and all that and."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
5075.0,Patient,"I think he was almost working up to ask me because I had a bad tire on my jeep at the time, and he seen it. And it was bald and don't get me wrong i'm appreciating very much for what he does, but he came out to me, and he was like I noticed that tire on eugene take this $50 and go straight and get a tire for your g. hmm and, as I know, was like the way night I don't know when I could pay back and he goes I don't want to pay back it's a gift. When I found out later that that's how you know real people and."
323.0,Provider,Different to.
5075.0,Patient,"Like the odium. Yes, and it was right after that that. Somebody had done something one of the counselors while Oh, I know what it was I had reported a counselor was actually having sex with one of the girls. In his office, and she came to me and said I don't know what to do, and she sent me the pictures."
323.0,Provider,Of them.
5075.0,Patient,You know. In his office and you could clearly see it was his office and that's what that's when I ended up buying a six pack and drinking because I had went and told.
323.0,Provider,ya know.
5075.0,Patient,"And then, it probably got brought up in group. or something you know. and She went and supposed to know that I was the one that told about it, his conversation was directed right at me and I just got up and I said see yeah you know and i'm on my way home I stopped guys six pack and. When I woke up the next morning I was like you know what. I can't be going to that place. yeah mike's going on. If I don't get out of there i'm going to be drinking or using all over again and that's when I left there oh so there was so many things going on, you know and it's sad because in the beginning, it helped me, you know that accountability. But as time went on it just got bad and. I still am."
323.0,Provider,"Bad players like that, and you know. it's going to go down hill."
5075.0,Patient,wow and especially. One of the counselors died of an overdose while I was there. i'm the one of the counselor was by what is it no. No one of the counselors was. Buying okay. And you know that stuff starts getting around.
323.0,Provider,yeah yeah absolutely.
5075.0,Patient,"Well, it just went right for me after a while, and I was like you know what now I gotta get out of here and."
323.0,Provider,"glad you did yeah absolutely that will catch up, I mean then that's exploitation anyway, which is no. good thing miss you so. Many people. Exactly."
5075.0,Patient,And then. You kind of. big new mindset.
323.0,Provider,abuse them all over again.
5075.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. that's when I went to on that you know does my doctor before I come here. You know i'm. not like it was just though the way you bring them. You know, like during the whole colby. situation he sat behind your screen. But he had 20 people out the way me."
323.0,Provider,Right.
5075.0,Patient,"You know, and you know, I was thinking you don't care, and I wish my one friend, you know I wish she had the correct insurance, where she could get swayed. because she hates it, I mean she hates it and now."
323.0,Provider,She told me last time she called us.
5075.0,Patient,um it's been a while.
323.0,Provider,She probably should try to call again because we're always working with different insurance companies to try to get on their panels.
5075.0,Patient,will see she works works for walmart so her insurance us through walmart and I don't know what that is. But i'll mention it.
323.0,Provider,Just to call a check and see if anything's changed. Because it could be.
5075.0,Patient,"yeah and. I know she said now what they're trying to do is. Do the script elements. Inside right at the doctor's office, and now that word you see the doctor and you go in another room and you deal with a pharmacist next in the same building, but she said, for now i'm not going to do that she said, because his office is screwed so much on up already. In the past, she goes i'm i'm dare find to use them because, like a couple people she knew that done it. They went over a week without their medicines."
323.0,Provider,Oh no.
5075.0,Patient,"yeah and she was like you know that would send me right over the edge, you know, and so you know I can't see that working out too well, because it just the way everything's ran."
