527.0,Provider,"hi this is Andrea, this is an individual session for doll Parker. hey Johnny how are you."
11857.0,Patient,What are you doing.
527.0,Provider,i'm doing all right now right.
11857.0,Patient,"Sorry i'm a couple minutes late, there was some I got held up in traffic more than I anticipated to get to the office. With my cannot they evidently I was paying the wrong copay and they needed to collect more money."
527.0,Provider,So no.
11857.0,Patient,Was it was it okay.
527.0,Provider,yeah okay well how's things going.
11857.0,Patient,"pretty good. i'm you know. i've been thinking about a lot about what I was going to talk to you about this morning and uh. You know i've been hearing really for the last five years, a lot of people say whenever something happens in your life, like a divorce or maybe somebody very close to you passes away. People always say, well, this is a time for you to work on yourself. And you know I don't really feel like i've been doing that up until recently. Okay, like, I am now so that's a good thing, I feel like. i'm changing for the better. Sure, no, I want to."
527.0,Provider,What do you think's been the biggest change so far.
11857.0,Patient,"Ah. Well, one thing I would say that I don't want to do anymore is I don't want to push people away from me people that are important to me, you know I understand about boundaries and all. That, I think he I don't think I know that my attitude has come off in the past as being arrogant and I don't like it. Okay, and I started thinking about this Andrea and I, you know I don't know. For sure where this drives from, but I really think it is about the way that I felt about myself, much of the time. and You know. I. I think I come off as arrogant, as I look back and I, you know, and especially when I talked to my cousin Lisa. Okay she's been really. kind of my life coach or my therapist side of therapy. yeah and she was she pointed it out to me a while back, and I know we've talked about it, some and I just don't want to be that way anymore I don't. I don't want to be unhappy. I don't want to feel like i'm not good enough, because I think this is the kind of behavior that leads to that. arrogance that can come out. and often it comes out in the form of ignoring people. Okay, not making people feel important. Okay, and. I don't want to be that way, especially with people that are important to me."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm winter into do you think it was just your kind of Defense mechanism like if you kind of look at it now like that was something that kind of helped protect you and, like make you, you know kind of. feel more confident than you really were and not necessarily intentional either, but that's just kind of how it came up came about, for you."
11857.0,Patient,"Totally it's a Defense mechanism it's what I revert back to that's where my comfort zone is you know I think i've spoken you some about this. By when I was a kid I was going from school to school to school, I was often the new kid ah shy quiet and picked on often relentlessly you know here's here I am growing up in southern California and. You know, I have long hair I were bands I were op shorts with my Boxer shorts that stick out and all my mom says we're moving to Oklahoma and boy That was one hell of an experience so."
527.0,Provider,I would have been picked on.
11857.0,Patient,"You know i'm not a victim, by any means a lot of kids dealt with that stuff especially back then, but I was bullied so when you say Defense mechanism yeah. Now now i'm in I don't want to be so much where I prove them prove them wrong screw those guys. Yes, much like that to where. I feel like I need to overcompensate to say that i'm good enough and I think part of that overcompensating can be can be construed as arrogance and I don't want to show you that way."
527.0,Provider,hasn't shown its ugly head recently is that.
11857.0,Patient,Totally i'm cycling women like playing cards. And I don't want a.
527.0,Provider,anymore okay.
11857.0,Patient,"I don't want to do that and also, I want to have better relationships with the people that are my friends and family. Okay, you know I want to expand those relationships and have more. Sure abundance of."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm so what was lisa's feedback for you, because I know you generally you know trust her you know, honesty and feedback."
11857.0,Patient,A she basically said that it's good that I acknowledge it.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11857.0,Patient,"And i'm cognitive of it, because the only way, you can really change behavior is to acknowledge it and do try to really work on doing something about it be more conscious in the moment. Shannon could happen subconsciously. You know if your if your conscience conscious of it in the moment. You know, you can you can react differently."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11857.0,Patient,So she thinks it's good that I acknowledge it. I do. I I don't want to be lonely anymore.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11857.0,Patient,"So, and I don't want people. To think that I think that i'm better than them because i'm not better than anybody. Okay okay I don't I don't I don't feel that way I don't want people to think, I think that way yeah."
527.0,Provider,Because if they really knew how you felt.
11857.0,Patient,"They would know that it's different than that yeah. So you know I think about experiences in high school and their grueling experiences, I mean I remember when I was a junior in high school being the new kid. I, this is the third high school that I went to being the new kid I was a junior and I was transferred in the middle of the year, which even makes it worse."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah exactly.
11857.0,Patient,"I was in this, I was in this metal shop class I used to always I took metal shop every year in high. School a lot of guys do I, I took metal shop wood shop in gym as much as I could. bye is in this class and there was it was just guys in the class or were no females in the class. But we had this teacher and he was just he was an older guy and he was so dumb I mean he would leave the class for the almost the entire time of the class much at the time, and that is absolutely foolish to leave. You know 15 1617 year olds in a class. full of full of metal pipes and equipment and all kinds of. You know shit. Just an idea Well he did it all the time and there was this guy in there His name was Stan pace and he was a real asshole he was he was much bigger than me was a senior and East to pick on me relentlessly and I remember."
527.0,Provider,I was scared to death yeah.
11857.0,Patient,He spit in my face in front of every other kid in that classroom.
527.0,Provider,How how degrading.
11857.0,Patient,"So I was the new kid. And I told him I said I didn't want to. I didn't want to get into a fight in school because I didn't want to get kicked out of school. Sure, and also, he was he was a semi professional Boxer. um you know he probably would have kicked my ass real good. Sure, but you know the reason why I ended up in that school is because I went to go live with my aunt and uncle my mom and I had a falling out and I went to live with my aunt and uncle, on the other side of town. And what ended up happening was. The stand pace ended up finding out that my cousin was darryl Parker we shared the same last name. Okay, that cousin was a State champion wrestler in the state of Oklahoma. Okay, so he backed off pretty quick darryl ended up calling and talking to his brother and he never messed with me anymore. And that wasn't good, but that was just one experience. yeah so. You know I can list others that were like that."
527.0,Provider,"Well, as well, what was the reaction from the rest of it kids in the class."
11857.0,Patient,laugh okay laugh.
527.0,Provider,Like nobody stood up or.
11857.0,Patient,"Not at all. No, he was the bully of the entire class wow I mean he was the bully of the class and here's the new kid coming from the other side of town he's shy and quiet yeah. So I think about that night, you know part of me. The world I think it's different now I mean my my son tells me that he there's team never sees that in high school anymore and i'm glad that the world's changed. As that shit was just horrible."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11857.0,Patient,yeah that was probably the worst one. Andrea because that one was the most embarrassing. yeah it was just. It was horrible so you know.
527.0,Provider,Talk about crossing boundaries personal boundaries wow. yeah Sam sorry that happened to me. that's that's horrific.
11857.0,Patient,"yeah it was it was hard, and you know I always avoided fights I really did it ever wanted to fight. yeah and you know, to this day, I still haven't been in a fight, since I think I was a sophomore in high school. I mean, I would never want to do that and I always avoided it and I think the reason why is because, when I was young. My aunt janine you know another one of my nipples that I live with other than the one I just described. They also lived in Oklahoma city. And you know she loved my father very much that was her brother in law, and they were very close and you know my mom really didn't never really talked to me much about my dad. talk to me. And she's always discouraged me from getting into getting into fights you know. Sure, and the reason why is because what happened to my father. When I was in the fourth grade what really prompted her to do this is because I did something when I live with him, I was I live with them when I was in fourth grade. And there were some kids down the street from you in fact one of them is is my good friend on Facebook. Okay, so i've known him for shit. You know 45. and very Goodman and a kid across the street named Scott Patterson I used to go down there and play with them Scott was one year ahead of us and. Mary was in the same year. As me so Barry and I were in the fourth grade and Scott, was in the fifth grade and we're just the neighborhood kids. Sure, and kids are kids we used to I used to go down there and race hot wheels. And I left one of my hot wheels at the House, and one of those kids put superglue in it, and I was pissed off and the will. glue in the wheels, and it just screwed it up and I ended up getting my heart will back, and it was all screwed up. And I ended no fight and I ended up taking both of the rass at the same time in my and. I gave Barry a black guy have a. sign off oh my aunt saw back and. You know we all had to pay lay that the Scott and berries parents came down to our House and we all had a conversation and there's Barry over there with the black guy. Ah. And you know, we had that conversation, and they laughed and my aunt told me that you know to always avoid confrontation like that, so I really did I never want to fight that you're when you're growing up and redneck Oklahoma. Is see I lived there in the fourth grade, and then I moved back to California. And then. went back right about the right about the I think I was in the seventh grade."
527.0,Provider,Eight I.
11857.0,Patient,"was in the Eighth grade I went back to Oklahoma so those kids are different, you know they were just brutally redneck and it was racist and. You can just imagine. That it was it was all the things that. It was they were just you know assholes and I was picked on quite a bit going from school to school to school. So you know getting back to the Defense mechanism yeah This is where my comfort levels been you know yeah. And I think it can come off as being arrogant and naughty. I don't I don't want to be that way I don't want to talk that way or that way. I just want to be sincere and authentic okay."
527.0,Provider,"So where's your aunt share, about your bed."
11857.0,Patient,"A that my dad. was a good man. And he was a hothead and my dad I don't know if i've ever shared the story, I told you my dad died when I was a little boy. He died from. From an event when he was in the military, it was an altercation with another GI. Okay, and we don't know the whole story of what happened, but we know that my father ended up dying in this event. My father was about to be decommissioned from the military's his term was almost stover. You know, I was born in in Alaska fairbanks on a military army base. And when I was about three weeks old four weeks old. My mom ended up flying back to Oklahoma and taking me with her my dad stayed there, he was going to be there, I think, through the end of April or the beginning of May. And I was born on on January 17 and my father passed away in the middle of March and an altercation with another soldier. What they told us what they told our family, the military. Was they said that my father. was a you can imagine, like the barracks Okay, you know where everyone goes and there's bunk beds. And what the military told our family was that my father was shining his shoes on the top bunk. And a soldier walked in to the barracks they were the only ones in there and and they said that they had a verbal altercation earlier in the day, so i'm assuming this soldier came back looking for my father. Sir, I don't know he may have accidentally just walked in there, but my father's shining his shoes now remember there's only two people in the in the room, and they they said that when my father. He ended up putting he ended up dropping the shoeshine that was in his that was in his hand and jumping off the top bunk and he slipped his foot slipped on the on the shoe Polish. And he hit his head. on the back of the bunk now the evidence did indicate that this could have happened. So there was no effort, because the military did a full on investigation and they basically they didn't tell us the other party's name, for you know, for obvious reasons. But uh they they you know they they they they basically said that this is how you know, Donald Donald died he and what happened was uh. He was on his back and they said, what is it called when your fluids starts to build up when you're unconscious and you actually kind of lose auction he kind of drowned in your own."
527.0,Provider,Okay yep.
11857.0,Patient,"One of those things, and if the guy would have just turned my father over it probably would have been a okay. But. You know, he didn't know and yeah that's just something you know, we should all they should teach that in school, if someone passes out and they're you know they're in trouble breathing flip them over."
527.0,Provider,I think you're supposed to lay him on your on their side.
11857.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, yes, absolutely i'm on their side that they can breathe and uh. You know. My and my father had been in fights quite a bit. In high school, he was a hothead and he's emotional dude obviously great looking dude to I mean just a really good looking guy had a little waist and taper chest and. It was smaller than me, though, and the way I know that it's kind of weird because now, I have this high school Ray and his wedding ring. And I can barely get them on my pinky. My dad was you know, he was smaller than me. share so. yeah but that's the reason why my had that conversation you want that to happen to me. This is all donnie. I don't want you to end up like your father. She loved me so much. She taught me good things to really good things in fact. I think some of the best things that I learned I learned from my angie. You know. don't steal don't lie because lies just lead to more lies, and then you forget your lies, and then you."
527.0,Provider,Just like more.
11857.0,Patient,"Right yeah. don't don't ever hit a girl. And you know things like that they were really important and I stuck with them and I taught my children enough to you know my children know there's there's one thing we don't ever do is strike a woman to hurt her in any way. And we don't allow that in our presence either. So I owe those things to my engineering, she was a really. Important part of my my youth, she was great I got to see her at my grandmother's 98th birthday party and I hadn't seen. And it was so good. yeah I am seeing her we you know we talked on the phone but i'm seeing her in my shit. 30 years 30 plus years. So. i'm glad I got to see her because she ended up passing away a few years after that. But she her in my uncle ended up getting a divorce. My uncle was it was a cheater. and She ended up marrying another man and I ended up meeting her new husband, he was a nice man and, ironically, my uncle was there, too, and I think that's the first time, those two had been. Many, many years to. Share they weren't today didn't talk to each other, but you know it was kind of a neat thing that we were all there, I mean at my grandmother's 98th birthday party, they were probably 150 people there, my grandmother had nine children. So."
527.0,Provider,Imagine yeah.
11857.0,Patient,"I have, I have first cousins. So that's a lot. yeah so there were a lot of a stair That was a really great moment i'm sorry i'm getting emotional i'm just thinking about these things, and you know."
527.0,Provider,"i'm talking, I was gonna say what. What kind of things have you just been reflecting on for yourself donny that. I mean, I think it's good that you're able to like allow yourself to connect to that that emotional piece and reflect."
11857.0,Patient,"Well, I think what I really want what's bringing this all to a head is, I want to change my life. I want to, I want to meet be my meet my potential in my career and my personal life my family, I want to get out of the emotional bullshit hole that i've been in for a long time. You know, since my divorce, I want to grow, I want to be a better person."
527.0,Provider,You know you feel like you're stuck.
11857.0,Patient,"I think i've been stopped by being pissed off and i'm you know angry about what's happened. And that bitterness eats people alive, it really does it's not good. and You know."
527.0,Provider,Is this showing is it showing more in your dating.
11857.0,Patient,"I think it has been absolutely I think it has been i've come off as arrogant. And a lot of it is. You know. Not intentional, but some of it has been. Okay, I want to be either one of those things you know I think about like the woman that I met Kathleen. She was out in palm desert and she saw you know you're a bad communicator. she's right, I have been a bad communicator. Okay now with that said don't get me wrong because she showed me a lot of red flags. That said, that that was not going to be a good situation. Sound at all. But uh she was right about died, you know. And I think about that time when we walked out of the restaurant. I probably would have been better, instead of just walking away from her insane you're an unhappy person if it would have been better for for me and for her. For me to say you know what I think we should be just friends uh I think and just walked over and gave her a hug and just pointed out. You know you can't push me out of your life by by being rude or or by us talking to each other in a bad way. I just want you to know you're not going to push me out of your life that easy let's be friends, we can go for hikes we can we can go to concerts we both love music. You know that would have been a better way to do it versus just sitting there listening to her bitch to me for 20 minutes and what she was bitching about was a cry out for help. And I didn't even know I didn't even see that, when it was happening remember what I said, Andrea I want to be more I want to be more aware of what's happening when it's happening. Often, I look at these things and I second guessed some later and i'm thinking donny you handled that wrong, and this is clearly a situation where I handled it wrong, she was crying out for help, she she was long she's a lonely person her whole family died. yeah you know and she's all by herself, and this is her Defense mechanism."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
11857.0,Patient,I want to be more aware of those kind of situations when they're happening so I can be a better person at that time.
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah and I think sometimes you get wrapped up in you, you you specifically, but sometimes we get we get wrapped up in the emotional piece of it, and so, then we kind of lose perspective of things too. So sometimes it is having to just kind of take a step back and go wait a minute what's you know what's the what's the full picture here like yes there's a lot of emotions going on, but really what's needed in this moment. And so you know and sometimes it's just we just react to you know because, because when people are emotional you're like I just need to I just need to stop this."
11857.0,Patient,mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,You know and and she was struggling to stop it herself.
11857.0,Patient,"I asked her I said, do you consider me your friend. No. No. And right, then I should have said okay you're not going to push me out of your life so easy and gave her a big hug and said let's be friends let's start over as friends. And just take it from there yeah because that's what she needs. To be better in those in those moments. Andrea I want to be better when i'm in that moment, you know."
527.0,Provider,"What typically do you feel in that moment, are you kind of feeling like. Anxious on the inside, like okay."
11857.0,Patient,"And it's just instinctual words that are coming out and it ends with me saying you know you're a miserable person I hope you find your happiness and walking away. be bigger be better donnie be the bigger, better person, instead of just doing it for you donny do it for her. because she she she needed it right, then she needed something different than what she's been dealing with with men for years. You know."
527.0,Provider,"And, and your response was i'm going to show you kind of that i'm better you know i'm better than that."
11857.0,Patient,"Bingo Bingo and I think that that's the reason why she ultimately called me out on my communication because she probably. You know, was used to communicating with guys that were constantly texting her, and you know validating her and I wasn't doing that at all. And that's not the that isn't how you build a relationship. If you want a relationship you don't do it that way. You provide I mean you. Women and men need validation."
527.0,Provider,"rideshare yes, yes, definitely."
11857.0,Patient,"So I realized that, now more than ever."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So what happened recently, because I know you were had some plans and some dates lined up."
11857.0,Patient,yeah well I did meet a woman that lives there always from San Diego. Actually her name is Carla spelled with the sea. And you know my ex wife's name is CARA de.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11857.0,Patient,"she's a German immigrant Turner Turner Turner has her ex husband immigrated here. He has an MBA and he went to work for Amazon and he's a big time executive down in San Diego, and this is so common he ended up having an affair, they ended up getting a divorce she's an intellectual and wow this is really, really kind of different from me. She said she actually be a professor at Berkeley, of all places the classical liberal, which I kind of consider myself to be a classic liberal. i'm open minded I don't i'm not down with all this woke stuff. On that she's definitely with me on that and. that's good, but you know. we've been talking for a while and we've been facetime and we met last weekend. and We had a lot of fun she's a fun girl, I mean it's just something different, and any other woman that i've ever did. It. I mean she's the she's the German immigrant who has an American made tesla and i'm the American boy who has a German made BMW."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11857.0,Patient,"But she lives in del mar down in San Diego. Okay, so i'm gonna go down there this weekend and spend the weekend, with her. we'll see what happens, I mean. there's a lot of things that i'm attracted about her. You know, other than her lux she's attractive. But she's also plays classical piano. She speaks three languages. and She knows how to make Indian food and. she's just a. smarty pants on another level, for me, I mean I don't even i'm just short it, I went back to school and I didn't mean complete my associates degree, you know i'm that close, but every got my associates degree in you know she's back in school right now to get her PhD."
527.0,Provider,"So what's your plan to kind of. kind of check yourself during this weekend like what do you feel like you, we need to kind of focus on and direct kind of help you recognize and redirect yourself."
11857.0,Patient,"I think that just being cognitive of it being aware of it and thinking about it, and instead of yanking yanking. In other words, instead of my impulse and instinct say to do this, and this might come off as provocative. do the opposite. Okay, so."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and I think just just kind of evaluating your emotions your emotions to like regulating those more like if you start feeling like that anxiety kind of fueling then. Okay lets you know what do I need to do right now, maybe I just need to like. You know, take a couple deep breaths you know she doesn't have to know i'm doing this, but just kind of like. All right, let's like kind of calm myself down here, and you know clear some space to think a little more rationally like if I notice or. You know let's you know i'm gonna i'm gonna go walk outside or you know let's take a walk first you know if it's feeling like too intense and you need to move or do something that would help like just kind of checking in every so often with your like your emotional gauge."
11857.0,Patient,Do you think that this is the primary reason why people meditate what you just described is to keep themselves in that type of balance or homeostasis.
527.0,Provider,"yeah probably probably. And just kind of keep themselves in the present moment you know being very mindful, in the present instead of like, especially with ADHD die, like the thoughts are like. And then, like thing you know you've got these like offs and then you're like. Oh crap what did I just do you know so. yeah so part of that is like just trying to kind of keep themselves and check a little bit like okay. i'm getting a little obnoxious right now. Or you know or or like. is so anxious i'm shutting down i'm because I know that these these Spikes are going to start flying out here, and so i'm going to porcupine or."
11857.0,Patient,Right right So do you think that my ADHD is hereditary or do you think it's a result of my experiences or a combination of both.
527.0,Provider,um I would. I don't know.
11857.0,Patient,No one really knows for sure we don't know completely about.
527.0,Provider,"it's you know it's so hard to turn because there's so many people that get diagnosed as adults and it's really kind of been. But it's been masked you know they've they've been able to you use substances to manage it, you know early on, you know a lot of kids you know that's. that's where a lot of substance use starts, you know in in middle school high school is because it's maybe. it's not uncommon I shouldn't say it always happens, but it's it's very common that you know kids start using substances, because. That is a way to kind of slow their thoughts down and not get them into so much trouble, but then they but then that addict you know, then there's addiction in the family, and so, then that you know that just accumulates and complicates things with addiction so yeah. yeah i'm sure there's probably you know some hereditary traits to it, I think that's probably accurate as well. yeah I think things, and it was probably hard as many times that you change schools donnie it wasn't you know you probably weren't in enough stable situation that kind of see those repetitive behaviors year after year, you probably kind of got by year from year, and so it, you know."
11857.0,Patient,"I want to cover this kind of floating through that. Sharing I don't want to flow through life like that anymore Okay, so I feel like i'm still doing that and I don't want to do that anymore, I want to be more cognitive. more aware of what's going on at the time. And where I can really shine and be a better person at that moment, and it, you know I I i've been you know I just described the the the the incident with Kathleen you know in pond out in palm desert. That is a perfect example."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so what's your plan for the weekend, like are you guys doing things are you going to have some downtime just to have some conversation."
11857.0,Patient,"Well i'm taking my bikes down there i've got a MW that actually the seats full down it's kind of a hatchback it's called it's called a grand poop so I can put both of my bikes in the back, she likes to ride bikes. So we're going to ride around mission day on Saturday and then Saturday evening we're probably going to go out to dinner. hang out downtown San Diego which is like. I don't know, maybe 20 miles south of del mar. And, and you know just have a great weekend and. Okay i'm home on Sunday, I think i'm going up there on set on Friday evening."
527.0,Provider,"So one of the things I want you to maybe try practicing and working on for yourself is is trying to be more mindful in the moment, so if you're having a conversation with her. I want you to like really focus in on the conversation, and if you find yourself like getting distracted like bring yourself like hold on, let me real that thought in what's you know. What she's saying what do I need to clarify that I missed because I went I went out here for a little bit like just try to see if you can keep bringing yourself back to the moment and focus on.
