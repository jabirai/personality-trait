226.0,Provider,"Okay, great okay cool so um. just give me a little bit of background like what brought you to bret Hart and why you're seeking services right now."
6940.0,Patient,"um Okay, well, I want to say. I grew up kind of like rough um you know I know like people have more issues than me, obviously, but. I just have issues kind of building or maintaining relationships with people, I have a lot of anxiety, I have depression and there's a lot of drug abuse in my family and so there's been abuse physical abuse, sexual abuse. And I just I didn't know how to deal with it, when I was growing up, I acted out I lashed out um I I mean my mom had a very crazy relationship I ended up. leaving the House and committing crimes and then I started going to Jill and I was like 13. And I just continued like literally I think about it, like had somebody just sat me down and like just been like and people tried, but they just didn't know what to say to me, you know. How they just sat me down like girl if you don't stop this you're just going to make your life so much worth. It but just saying that it's not enough like saying like you know, like if you commit crimes you're going to have a record you're not going to be able to get a job. you're going to be on hold your you think you're suffering now you're going to suffer so much more if you don't get your shit together, but no nobody really like you know I mean who's going to tell you right so it's i've just been like a train wreck. For these year. and on top of everything like I started self medicating with like drugs and alcohol luckily today i'm not on heavy drugs but I literally can't be around people that do drugs because i'm just i'm still tempted to do it, and I have like occasionally done some stuff. But it's not like. Like I was when I was younger I like call people are just hanging out with people to get the drugs, I took I literally don't. And I met somebody lives like right across the street, for me, like parties all the time party house drugs like all kinds of stuff I could just walk right across the street. and get. High you know, and I look at the House every day and not like i'm not like, I want to be in that life, you know but i'm just like sometimes i'm like i'm just going to like. i'm just going to get cracked out right now, you know but luckily I did do it once but luckily I it's been over a year since i've gone over there and done anything but um so basically, I have a hard time keeping a job. Maintaining my my family relationships even really she was was my neighbors I have anger issues, I mean, besides the drugs and alcohol and my criminal behavior my my. mind. hold on. Have a roommate he's leaving tomorrow so hope he doesn't need to know but he's gonna hear stuff anyways i'm not only has my drug and alcohol i'm. affecting my life negatively and stopped me from having children getting married maintaining a job exchange school, but I have this nasty temper. When insane like i'm, just like the Hulk when I get upset. And I got upset like about a week ago, and did some property damage. And I think I was on on video camera, and I was. sort of blocking out the. sort of. Wanting to cause mayhem onto an innocent person. That i'm just like angry and i'm causing harm, and I can tell you it's pretty much about every single day of my life, I want to hurt somebody I want to do something to people, because I want them to suffer as much as i'm suffering. I mean that's awful right like what's wrong I literally. I don't think i'm okay I don't think that i'm safe. To myself or others, I think that I need to I think I need to get help before I seriously hurt myself or others anymore than I already have, and then I need to get some sort of. tools inside, you know to deal with. My emotions with behaviors with addictions, like the list goes on, you know it's just like hey so."
226.0,Provider,Do you feel like you're um do you feel like you're a danger to yourself right now.
6940.0,Patient,"No, not right now i'm not. i'm no."
226.0,Provider,Do you have like any kind of suicidal ideation.
6940.0,Patient,"No, I I do think about. Okay, I do think about dying often and I don't want to be here, but let me tell you, like last time I felt like that probably all know there's been a couple of times, but right before the pandemic, I was in San Francisco and I was on the bridge. And I was like i'm just gonna do it i'm just gonna fucking do it. i'm like i'm just going to do it, I was like once you do it you're already done you're done you don't have to there's no, you know you're just done at that point and. Then I started looking up like, and you know, I was like well, let me make sure I actually really died because to me what would be worse would be like getting stuck in like a vegetable state. When I was like like looking up like ways to kill yourself like guaranteed and then like. And then, and then they were saying on the San Francisco bridge, you might not die if you don't jump in headfirst. You know, you could end up just paralyzed or even by the fishes slowly or slowly done this or that and i'm like this is not how I want to die, and then you know i'm just like looking like. different ways to die, and sometimes that makes me feel better because i'm like nope not doing that not doing that not doing that. I mean you know what I give up this is too hard, like it's not a guaranteed, so I don't think that's like an issue for me, but you know when I get. When I in fact I have a knife, I have a knife Max gave me it's like one of those. Like flips out is a very beautiful like decals on and whatever. And when, and when I was like holding and I, and once the i'm like drunk and i'm like just fucking do it just do it just stab yourself right in the fucking good multiple sucking times. And just you know, I was like and nobody and you're not going to call from help and nobody's going to save you you just gonna fucking bleed out slowly and your fucking room and I don't know what stopped me from seven myself, but I literally need to get rid of that shit any ago. Its protection for for me. But I it's just dangerous I needed i've had to after I get off the phone with you i'm gonna go on with throwing trash before that ever happens again because."
226.0,Provider,"So, so I know alright, so I mean thoughts, you know thoughts are different than an actual plan and intense, so you don't have you don't have intention so here's here's The thing is that. you've had opportunities, where you could have you know really hurt yourself and you didn't so what that shows me is that you have enough life force inside of you, you have enough will to live. Inside of you, even though things get rough and even though you still have a lot of hurt and anger inside so. yeah it's really like low low risk for suicide no suicidal ideation no plan like no intent okay so here's. here's also let me explain something to you, too, is that. When any when anybody goes through childhood trauma any kind of sexual abuse physical abuse. Neglect you're going to have anger you're going to have a 10 anger and everybody's going to react differently to that you're going to have depression you're going to having side so it's really about, you know working through some of that trauma you do it at your own pace. You do it as you're ready to do it, you take it one one little step at a time, so let me ask you are, you are, are you on any kind of medications right now. No Okay, are you wanting to get on medications. No okay so you're really wanting, just like group and individual counseling."
6940.0,Patient,"yeah The thing is that I was on medication, when I was little and like there was, like so many I was like overmedicated I missed like a semester school and I was kind of zombie doubt, and I really don't remember any of it, and when I stopped medicating myself, I felt like nothing was fixed. And i'm not responsible enough to take. meds every day like. that's why I don't take the pill, you know because I voted to take it i'm just not like that, like i'm like all over the place right, so I don't want to medicate myself, I want to like heal myself from the inside, where where i'm going to be like aware of my my progress. Like i'm like oh Okay, because I don't personally for me I don't think that meds will do it and plus I got my blood ran. And he said that in my liver might have a little damage, I have to call my doctor gets. Seen into that because that's that's what i've done to myself, so not really killed myself, but I know that when I drink and I do drugs and I smoke that i'm hurting myself, and I could potentially die young, I know what i'm doing. And i'm still doing it because i'm like I don't want to be here like forever I really don't in fact like I feel like i'm just here to fucking suffer like I don't want to be here like but i'm not gonna do anything about it, no i'm just gonna fucking complained about it, like."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Okay, so when when you were using what was your drug of choice, what were you alcohol."
6940.0,Patient,"No, I would say the I wasn't picky um. I did meth and cocaine. And we need an alcohol all kind of at the same time, I know, like a lot of potheads don't like math and a lot of methods don't like pop it's not really something that like intertwined but. I would get so high up I needed to kind of get down and then I would and I kind of like it's weird I like the uppers and downers at the same time, so."
226.0,Provider,"You know that that creates confusion in your mind your body. Your body can't figure out what the hell's going on Okay, so when you say you started using drugs to set out like what, in your teenage early teens. yeah what were you using."
6940.0,Patient,"I went in heavy right away um I would say that I, that I was doing math weed and alcohol, I was doing it on a daily basis by the time I was 16. math wasn't like a real issue until I got into my 20s. And then we'd also wasn't like a real issue until I got into my 20s so it was it was mostly alcohol that's been consistent. that's the time that I started medic self medicating."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and when was the last time you drank alcohol."
6940.0,Patient,i'm probably about 48 hours ago.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and how much did you drink when you when you train how much."
6940.0,Patient,"um I went to visit okay. I was on a binge. For this, so I believe I started off with my favorite is the three pack tall cans and middle which I think that's that's probably like. One talk hands like two. beers so it was like six. beers and then I called my friend at three he came to pick me up he had a bottle of malibu and what I did was I poured the malibu into a water bottles, so that he wouldn't know that I was drinking, so much so, I like he takes me home I finished the water bottle this size. malibu and then i'm like i'm not i'm not buzzed enough yet and I go to the store. And I get six more tokens."
226.0,Provider,huh mm hmm.
6940.0,Patient,"I don't even know how much I drink it was just like a binge. Where. You know, to me that the liquor store people see me and they're like again. Like like this is what i'm talking about like people literally are always telling me like I have an issue so again, and I was like yeah well I need to sleep and i'm going to tell you that two days later, I still feel drunk my stomach feels yucky I don't feel good. I feel like shit. I look like shit I look pale I feel awful awful of them dying. From my pores. And I can't even drink this coffee, because with alcohol coffee like you know, whatever so."
226.0,Provider,Right okay. and Have you ever been on medications to not know tracks on it helps to not you know crave that alcohol.
6940.0,Patient,"um he prescribed it to me doctor was a hacker. yeah hacker he prescribed me some something like that he said, to promote the cravings and it's up a CBS right now waiting for me to pick up, so I have not tried that but I have it, if I want to, but. You know, for me, it's not like to me cigarettes are like what I crave alcohol is more like triggered alcohols like. If i'm upset about something i'm like I just want to black out i'm like blackout time and that's half of me, and then I like drink up, it depends on my mood sometimes i'll get a whole bottle of jack and try to target sometimes like taking it eating like with a bottle of wine. So i'm like triggered or like fun, we got a party or an event or stay in there's. A lot of alcohol and people are like giving it to me. But see I don't know stop I do not know how to stop it's not just like one or two drinks like i'm like i'm not going to leave until i've dreamed in everything. I don't care if i'm on the floor wasted and you're kicking me out like i'm going to take one last bottle i'm not sure if you try to kick me out i'm going to be even worse. i'm going to get the bottle and i'm going to run out of here drinking and hopefully blackout, and hopefully not remember any of the bs I just did so yeah i'm not okay. I don't crave alcohol, in fact, you know when I get when i'm like oh it's bedtime and I. really need some watching TV, but I watched TV and then everybody's drinking all right on the TV shows all the time, the seals and the penthouse. office, and they have their little Bourbon whiskey set up and they're just drinking right during their lunch meetings or drinking afterwards, but. they're not doing that all the CEOs you know our military million years how often Are they really drinking that's not even realistic like and then you're like they're at parties are drinking whatever. So, and then like or if you're celebrating their drinking so then like when i'm celebrating a monk Oh, maybe I should get like a little glass, that would be like really nice like sit here, and you know, like watch YouTube videos the glass of wine that's not how it works out for me."
226.0,Provider,Like before I know it didn't know tracks on will help you like so it's not necessarily like. Like like a trigger I mean you drink So if you take that then you're not gonna you know you're not going to train.
6940.0,Patient,"It I mean I could give it a try and then, if I do drink it makes me feel like bad. yeah, but I feel like I already feel bad when I drink cuz my livers messed up, and I still drink."
226.0,Provider,"Well that's up to you, so if you want to take it, you can take it um alright So what about are you working right now."
6940.0,Patient,i'm a full time student.
226.0,Provider,Where are you going to school.
6940.0,Patient,"Right now i'm only going to Community college, because I didn't do good in school and I don't have money and. So I just I know that if you go to school, like two years at a Community college, you have your associates, you can get into like a university. yeah so at the end of the year i'm getting my associates and then next year I plan, if all goes well, to start going to a university. Maybe i'm going to have to because i'm a felon and multiple felony so I have to, I have to go into a school that. That is just I know Dominguez hills is like accepting like people 70% acceptance rate but that's what i'm looking for I want I don't want to have a downer like I want it like to be able to get in get a degree and get a job."
226.0,Provider,"Yes. What party California, are you."
6940.0,Patient,I live in Huntington beach.
226.0,Provider,"Okay So what about my family, because the family contact with them."
6940.0,Patient,"My mom was a black sheep of the family, she made a lot of bad decisions she's not a drug addict or alcoholic she just like me dumb ass decisions and she married somebody that was molesting my sister."
226.0,Provider,my sister was.
6940.0,Patient,"With the right my mom is completely ignorant um. When I got a boyfriend she like threw me out of the House would lock me out like pretty much made me homeless was a teenager and. pretty much right now, at this moment i'm not getting along with my sisters, either because of my alcoholism my older sister, the one that was molested um. She she thinks that i'm acting like a victim. And my little sister is, I feel is like cold hearted because she doesn't understand she wasn't around when all the abuse was happening, and she kind of my mom kind of figured it out by the time she came along in life so she. She lives with her sugar Daddy right now she just got a boob job she hasn't pay any rent she's never worked a day in her life she's 24 years old and. Looking at the world like differently, like she's just like what is wrong, like, why are you suffering life is so easy, so I can't talk to her, I can't talk to you I can't talk to you. I can't maintain any friendships I can't retain relations, I kept my 10 anywhere from girlfriends and you know I just. i'm always surprised when people want to be my friend. Because i'm like this is going to go horribly wrong, you know i'm just like i'm going to get drunk i'm going to do something stupid and you're not going to talk to me good."
226.0,Provider,"So what are some things that you want to work on like in counseling, what do you think would be helpful."
6940.0,Patient,"I think definitely my anger learning how to maintain relationships um. My emotions i'm very emotional very sensitive person I cry like every single day. I yell every other day I am constantly thinking negative maybe like a can learn some tools to like switch all of that around because. i'm scared to go to work because I already know, like i'm going to be yelling at somebody i'm going to be crying at work i'm going to give somebody attitude, or something like that, because I just don't I don't know how to deal with people."
226.0,Provider,"So, have you ever been on medication for mood stabilizers like what will you take the jury Member."
6940.0,Patient,"They had me on so love Deborah code and something else I can't remember but. depakote was the one I think that I really messed me up because I don't even know what I said I was like little I was little over 13. A little bit of mine, I don't know what I said, but some reason, I think that they said that I was like hearing voices or something I don't know why I was on that medication, because I don't hear voices my older sister actually hears voices not me but um. And so they put me on that and I was like in a coma Leo was like a zombie for months."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, any other addictions, it could be like gambling could be shopping could be eating Internet."

Somebody that gives me a joint on Saturday one small teeny tiny little joint and I make it last pretty much like all Saturday. My ex gave me some edibles I eat a few of them before bed. Which is like. really good because I used to just smoke and drink all day long. And now I hardly do that so."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so really it sounds like it's the alcohol use that needs to be reined in."
6940.0,Patient,"I quit smoking cigarettes last week, but then. I don't know what made me start again I really don't I went. I feel like shit I feel like shit I don't feel good I don't like it, I don't want to do it and I keep. Finding myself doing these things hurt myself."
226.0,Provider,Did you talk to Dr proctor about he could prescribe something for to stop smoking.
6940.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
226.0,Provider,yeah so that's something that you can talk to him about in group on Friday.
6940.0,Patient,that'd be wonderful.
226.0,Provider,yeah so that might be something that would be helpful for you um I honestly I would pick up that medication that he prescribed give it a try. just give it a try like you keep saying you feel awful you feel sick you drink it do things you drink to excess like nothing good comes from it to try something different.
6940.0,Patient,"Right i'll go pick it up today, right after we get off the phone with you."
226.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so any any legal issues, right now, like actively any cases that you've got going on."

6940.0,Patient,"Here, at my house in the alley."
226.0,Provider,"So did you what did you what property damage, but what."
6940.0,Patient,"But I can't get in trouble telling you that stuff right. um what's my roommates listening and tells me but um. There was a car. Oh i'm going to tell you what um my boyfriend ex boyfriend lives next door and I did that on purpose, because i'm kind of a recluse I don't like living leaving my house um so he lives in store he's he's younger than me he's he's like a skater and he likes. hanging out with his friends and drinking and smoking stuff whatever that's fine but. Ever since we broke up he's been like inviting like all these people like stay at his house and like like they're just sitting there, and like party and there's like these, who cheese running around and booty shorts with no browse online. Just like drinking smoking, so they parked in the alley and they're not supposed to park there and you're not supposed to have them traffic, it also has to be loud monkey music in the middle of the night like you know this is like a residential neighborhood like shut up. and Sabrina and other people here well. um I don't know I just I saw car and I got upset. I wasn't sure if it was one of theirs or somebody else's or any or I don't know I just was like well they're going to learn not to park here and not be here and I stopped the tire. With sharp object until and. I feel awful about it because it was not anybody related to him. And when it comes, you know when it comes out it's gonna be like. What if it is one of my neighbors and I was gonna be like what the hell is wrong with you. You know, like, why did you do that and i'm just gonna be like i'm just an angry jealous crazy bitch I was drunk I don't know like why I did that. Knowing that my life was going good right now ish you know better than it's ever been and i'm over here committing something that could possibly get me. It you're fine thrown in jail looks bad on with my neighbors because i'm actually believe it or not, like a member of the neighborhood watch. Exactly exactly i'm just like idiots."
226.0,Provider,"So okay So what about. Okay, any like financial issues, right now, that you're struggling with."
6940.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i've struggled financially my whole life I grew up very poor House very or I did not have my needs met or fridge was always empty. I had. When I when I actually ended up one of my crimes and I was like 13 whenever I ended up committing crimes running away from home I got put in juvie. When they. took me to juvie um they I refused to go home because things were so bad at my house that they ended up putting me in a group home. And when they put me in a group home that's when they started medicating me and they looked at my nails and they noticed that I had an iron deficiency I don't know if you've ever seen it, but my nails were like all spotted."
226.0,Provider,Like why i'm.
6940.0,Patient,"You know, like and I didn't know I just thought that was like normal whatever, but they had to give me iron pills for for for a long time it took for that to go away. And you know, basically, I remember not having clothes my mom like not combing my hair being like dirty I was like a dirty little ugly little child and. So grew up very poor digital my worth. didn't take care of myself. um you know I wish I was I wish my mom would have told me when I was like 15 or 16 like go get a job. Like I can't take care of you like voto work, but no she never said any of that to me in fact more than more than that, I mean I feel like my mom would probably be more like go to school, but. I didn't realize like I won't be able to get she didn't. She she's like Oh well, you know that's going to be hard I don't know does that really what you want to like is certainly encouraging me and I could probably be a vet right now but, whatever the hell. i'm that didn't work out and then she kicked me out as a teenager right committing crimes for money, once again, never really knew what a good income was. And then started committing the crimes and getting the felonies and going to jail and not having a home and never really had money never really had money like really literally like I have lived on the streets and it's sad because I live on the streets like picking food out of trash. Like I had. learned about dumpster diving behind grocery stores i've done food bank stuff and i'm kind I steal for grocery stores to get food. that's how I. And because at the time I had gotten a drug charge or wasn't even getting like I think I was getting food stamps but I wasn't getting like the money and. Just really, really struggle and because i've been homeless it's it's a constant fear every single thing. That i'm going. To be homeless again and i'm going to be a streets exposed and hurt and people are going to hurt me and i'm going to be in the trash again looking for food. And nobody's gonna help me because nobody. frickin helped me. In fact. we'll just use and abused me and oh Come on, you can stay here the night in the molesting me the whole freakin time don't let me sleep don't let me rest don't give me food don't help me better myself, so I have the constant fear right now I have. 1500 dollars so was to get another 800 for my school. And my rent is. 1900 dollars and I need to figure out how i'm going to pay my next not October, but november's right. So I have a month."
226.0,Provider,"You know, deep do you get so are you getting some kind of financial aid, like fafsa for school."
6940.0,Patient,"I am getting the financial aid so they're pretty much going to pay if I save every single dollar. And don't and i'm not buying it I don't even have a car, because I can't afford it, if I pay every single dollar, I will be able to pay my rent. Hopefully, because I keep getting like scholarship and stuff because I have good grades they're going to give me money to pay for my school up until December. But that's if I don't buy. anything at all, that means i'm you know I wanted to buy a flannel for fall, I wanted to you know have Halloween decorations like no life whatsoever forgetful forget the holidays forget, you know. Forget anything that I had thought even like right now, like, I wanted to get a camera stand, because I was going to do, like only fans or something like that, like. To try to make. Money because they're making like $2,000 a week like I need that to pay my rent so like i'm like okay i'm going to. invest and i'm gonna with my last dollar i'm going to get an x phone and i'm gonna get a camera sin and then like I don't even have money to get a canvas tag is there, like $100. And i'm just like. You know, like that's it like I unless i've come up with some money, I cannot buy. Anything I can't even buy myself a flannel shirt right now, no flannel shirt for me i'm wearing the same flannel shirts i've been wearing for three years. I have no money you know, but one time, I went to work and then you know I don't even know how it came up, but he is my coworkers like will you look like you're wearing last season's clothes. yeah Well, this is the same outfit i've been working for five years, because I have no money, thank you for pointing it out to me like."
226.0,Provider,"So is there anything like any kind of job that you could do like part. Time like I mean not right now, like let's let's kind of get you where you want to be um. But you know, have you thought about something you could do just part time to have some extra money coming in."
