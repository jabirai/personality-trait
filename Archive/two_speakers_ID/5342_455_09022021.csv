ID actually stopped my medication. And I went into withdrawals in my blood pressure was Skype and I started getting real dizzy and we right side gun whoo whoo into the hospital, they said I was having a. stroke stroke. So, since i've been building my right side, though it was closed by that I mean abrupt withdrawals to this Russian limits addictive is anything you know. i'm kind of scared oh. I told the doctor my doctor will exclude he says that you guys have to prescribe the pain medication that they can't do it, you can only for scribe like two days worth of the riaa. let's go back every two days and get another prescription for pain medication it's a it's pretty rough here the people with chronic pain. I got. To this slipping my spring quarter, we did. Is. They they were offering they weren't operating years gone I would let them know, is it prison in it's a it's a real dangerous operation you're going to catch you throw it up here move everything to the side and then. So the yeah I was gonna put it off till I got out of prison but. it's this is, I started to save doctors, I had when I was in prison here. So so everybody thinks you're a drug addict no because of the chronic pain is. What i've been. The medication for years. I get cluster headaches and then. I would take the. It plans or whatever. Then, then, so I prefer to be in this box in the future, no, I notice. To be honest, I notice, problems with the. With the dependency addiction. Depression. situational depression, the. I go through. Virtual changes with will have been stabilized on pain medication that's going on and off of it. is really screwed up."
