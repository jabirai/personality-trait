510.0,Provider,"i'm hanging in mm hmm. I I can't believe this is going to be our final session I had to like. I was like oh wow. I was like. And I think you were. If I looked at the calendar, so I think you were in group last week and I was out unexpectedly so i'm sorry I missed you in group. And a family issue, I had to to be away so hopefully it was okay I don't get to see much so i'm like oh man i'm not going to salmon group, and this is definitely gonna be my last. session so let's take advantage, what would you like to talk about today."
12373.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't know I feel like it's more about you today because it's like no i'm gonna miss you. And it's a it's been such a great journey, so I don't even really know what to talk about but i'm excited for whatever. chapter by chapter brings."
510.0,Provider,that's so sweet of you.
12373.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"But one thing, while you're thinking about that. I know you do group once a month, if you wanted to attend to the last week, because that will be my last week and I am sharing with my groups this week i'm doing, I wanted to do something fun and not that group isn't fun, but you know it's we're talking about emotional things we're. Talking about tough things right. So I wanted to sort of be a little paradoxical do something fun and that way people could remember you know change is not changes inevitable, as you know, but change doesn't have to be sad doesn't have to be awful. So I asked everyone, and hopefully they'll participate we'll see. i'm asking everyone to do show and tell so you can bring like a video you can bring a poem you can bring your animal you can bring artwork like I you're such an artist like. And you have to kind of show and tell okay we'll see i'll have obviously a couple things I always have a backup plan you know if. People aren't going to participate, I think there'll be a few, but if you wanted to come on the 28th you're welcome to, and I would love for you to do show and tell with us, but. I know you're on a monthly."
12373.0,Patient,"So that sounds awesome ladies look at the 28th real quick, because that does sound."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, yes, the 28th 1pm. Is your group."
12373.0,Patient,yeah i'd love to join or i'm gonna put in my calendar 1pm you said.
510.0,Provider,"yeah now there's anything you want me to screen share, as you know, I kind of screen share stuff if that would be easier, I can give you my bright heart email account my work account and that way i'm just i'm keeping things. kind of per group i'm so. We have a couple weeks about to think about but i'll i'll put in the chat. My email my work email I would love for you to showcase severe artwork and. Talk about that. yeah. There you go."
12373.0,Patient,See here with show and tell with Tara at. bright heart. group here. group therapy and that's going to be at 1pm. yep on the Tuesday the 28 Sep tember 20.
510.0,Provider,"yeah oh good, then I will see you and. I yeah I wanted to just do something a little different because I am a little different way."
12373.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
510.0,Provider,"going against the grain, a little bit. Well i'm not sure what to talk about I guess one thing we could part of our work together, we can just sort of look back on. yeah since we've worked together and kind of where you started and kind of what your initial goals were kind of where you're at now. I am able to share with you, I do have a name I don't know much about her yet and actually since you're going to be coming to group, it sounds like she will be attending the first time that group for show, and tell so she'll be introduced i'll be able to introduce her at sounds like. But her name is Karen Clark I don't have I just have the name and i'm being told, those that are in my 1pm and 2pm group they'll be assigned to her, and you are in that category so i'm still waiting on new other assignments that I can share that name with you."
12373.0,Patient,Okay.
510.0,Provider,"yeah i'm so for our work together yeah I mean think back I know it seems like Oh, I see is longer than it has been but about five months. And the initial goals that you had and. I remember, there was one talking about the trauma talking about kind of what happened to you as a kiddo. But if you think about those initial goals kind of what the work we've done, do you feel you've gotten the support you need it, do you feel like. you've made the progression, do you feel like you know I haven't really addressed that goal as much as I wanted to So what are your yeah just sort of reflect back on when you initially started and where you're at now."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah definitely thanks for bringing all that up because it's been such a long not long, but like just we've been through a lot together, and I feel like. When I first started i'm in a totally different place now and. yeah I think you know when I first found bright heart, I was like you know really nervous, I was like I don't know like. You know i'm looking into this company, because I like the website and I like how the therapist present themselves and it looks like they're really serious about. Going into like personal history, but I wasn't sure, because it was like there it's looks it looks like bright. bright heart health mostly focuses on addictions, I was like well you know, maybe I could have like a porn addiction I don't know or or at least I could be vulnerable enough to say that that's something that bothers me. I very nervously. You know, had a conversation with one of the clinicians. Over the phone about my situation, and it was like it was kind of challenging but I was like well at least I took a step to at least getting a therapist and. Then bright hearth bright heart health like exceeded my expectations, because for one like you're just such a great therapist and you just given me so much attention on like my issues that I just felt like I didn't expect that you know, sometimes when you get a therapist. The chemistry just isn't there, like you, don't really feel like you're talking you're agreeing on the same situations that you should be talking about so but that's not the case with you like, I feel like I really connected and. I felt like whatever I brought two bright hearth it was given back so like i'm really glad that I opened up quickly and made myself vulnerable because I felt like I got more out of the Program. Because of that, you know. Just coming being direct just saying everything right up front like this is what's bothering me so. And you know when I first had my first conversation with you, I received my second Madonna dose and."
510.0,Provider,"I remember that. And yeah making chicken soup, I remember."
12373.0,Patient,"I was like yeah like you know my my half brother lorenzen he was traumatized by CSA and i'm also having feelings of guilt and shame whenever I do watch pornography so like. I just I have all these feelings, but I don't really know what to do with them, or how to address them, maybe a therapist can help me and then that's when you that's when you started using this language like you know, maybe there doesn't have to be judgment. You know, maybe you could focus on you and if something comes out of that with. With Lorenzo and and you can move forward with that. My approach to like overcoming that first hurdle was like well, maybe I could write a letter either to myself or to my family that just really goes into explicit detail about how I feel about the situation i'm in in relation to my family. So I feel like that's where a lot of the initial kind of damage was done. And then, how does that show up in my daily life now. And I think partly the way that it shows up is that. i'm more and more of a place of acceptance about shame and guilt around our sexual or sexuality as a shared kind of phenomenon, however, it doesn't have to be so dramatic. and And the other thing was that with Lorenzo and when I met with him about a month ago, when I was seeing my mom you know he's just his own person if he has the strength to open up. By all means i'm a wonderful person to listen to him, but we don't know how the universe, is going to play out, but I think ultimately i'm just glad that I took steps on myself. So that I am in a place of you know, receiving I can receive whatever lorenzen has to give me if that's what you choose to do."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and what a powerful life lesson, you are, you have embraced it truly thank you recognize, because I know, there was a lot of hurt and shame and guilt, which is the key said, and so much compassion you're having for him and wanting to make it right for him on some level. But I think you finally realize. Well, I can't fix it for him, but I can work on me and be in a better place to provide time and space to him when he's ready because he's on his own journey. And I remember you sharing some letters that you had written that word just my goodness, I mean completely authentic love and compassion and what. What a journey, what a step, you have taken and you even took further steps with I think deepening your awareness and especially around mindfulness and present moment awareness with. Edgar totally which we do share a huge interest in him i've always been a huge follower of him and and and not that he wants to be a guru but those practices those teachings. you've really deepened your your insight so it's been a marvel and an honor to witness yeah and in the short time that's sort of the beauty. there's no timetable with therapy right, sometimes we can do leaps and bounds and very short periods of time and then sometimes it takes longer we might feel like we plateau a little bit, but. You have truly taken huge huge steps, I hope, you're able to see that I certainly want to provide that feedback to you."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah, I think, overall, looking back it seems like the best things that are around the corner often are scary at first, because they're just such a huge change. And you know I didn't know anything about bright hearth by heart health it just looked like an addiction Center and and I was, but I think, maybe that's what. attracted me is because that's the level of urgency that I felt with myself, is that I, I wanted to address this urgently and I wanted to go deeply into it. So it was a little scary at first so i'm glad that maybe that. Maybe that will inspire me or motivate me to. make other big changes if that's something that comes up in the future."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, what do you think besides just, I think, making that initial call to bright heart, you described as a little scary is is sort of tough through once he were enrolled and bright heart, and I know you're going to be continuing but just up into this point that's our reflection. doing together. What do you think has been the most challenging part for you is there been. Something that just really stands out it's been a real struggle. And I might not be i'm just sort of curious giving you a chance to to reflect."
12373.0,Patient,"Well, I I don't know if there's something that's the most challenging but when I go back to the feeling of what it felt like when I first called them. It was like well I don't I don't necessarily know that I identify as someone who's addicted I don't necessarily identify as someone who was hurt however i'm i'm being challenged by the inner conflict about. what's showing up in my daily life so and. And maybe I could address some issues, I guess, if I go all the way back if it felt like the biggest challenge was you know what is my responsibility, what Should I be doing. But then we kind of changed the language, a little bit sorry it was like. Instead of should like maybe there's possibility within myself, maybe there's possibility within relationships so. Maybe just initially feeling like feeling the judgment feeling the like I should do something was kind of a weight and then, as we started doing therapy, the language changed and the weight started to lift a little bit. So, but in term in regards to bright heart health as a agency I don't necessarily know that anything was particularly challenging or enjoyed the. group yeah I enjoyed the personal sessions with you."
510.0,Provider,"What um, what do you think is your biggest takeaway I know you've had a bunch that you reference, but what do you think your biggest takeaway from our work together that hopefully you'll kind of always. You know, carry as a life lesson or something that you have to take away, something you really like hey this helps me."
12373.0,Patient,"I think one is that I, I feel like i'm kind of naturally receptive and naturally good at listening, I naturally enjoy. Being in the groups and hearing other people's stories and I like being the space for other people, so I feel like there's kind of a kinship with other therapists it's like well that could be another door for me in the future, like or just. Being being that role or figure of someone who's has that open space for someone maybe not necessarily a therapist maybe a spiritual teacher, but like I feel like that's just an appropriate role or activity for me. And then number two is that. Already forgot what I was gonna say."
510.0,Provider,Okay circle back to you.
12373.0,Patient,"yeah but yeah I. Oh, I remember. And just usually, when I come to therapy i'm kind of pleasantly surprised. To hear other people's feedback, because that I learned things I didn't consider, for example, like. You just happen to know this yoga breath and I continue to that 555 every day now and I when I learned it from me, I was like maybe i'll use it, maybe I won't but it ended up being a big tool for me, so I used it today, you know so. So, like I enjoy I guess my biggest takeaway from breitbart health is that it's a good resource to have because I don't really know. i'm kind of pleasantly surprised by other people like whatever they suggest to me another example was the the wellness coach she suggested all these things to me that could happen in my daily routine that. never even considered before and they definitely did have an impact, a big impact, when I took action on them."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, not yeah I remember, you said that in the last session oh good good, what do you think you want, and obviously you're going to be establishing a new therapeutic working relationship with Karen. What do you think you want to continue to work on, or if there may be some new calls and just sort of curious have you started to reflect on that for yourself."
12373.0,Patient,"I haven't quite thought that far ahead i'm also a little bit anticipating possibly not having health insurance for a little while and not having access to a therapist. Part of me says that's Okay, because you know there's ups and downs to not working enough to. Have health insurance one is that. I have more time to work on my artwork and also it just gives me more time to reflect, which I feel like. i'm being generous to myself when I when i'm giving myself time away from work. But the downside is like well you won't have health insurance for six months, and you won't have access to a therapist for six months so it's like is that worth it, I don't know so it's a big decision that i'm kind of winging right now. And I kind of have to. I have to kind of act on that within by October, I guess, but but i'll still have bright heart health through. October and November, I believe. Okay, but i'll let i'll let the clinicians know that you know i'll probably make a decision soon about what I need to do. But yeah if I mean maybe I will decide to keep the health insurance and i'll continue with bright heart but within the two months that I do have it i'm not sure what all what i'll be talking about with that person yeah."
510.0,Provider,"And that's Okay, that really is okay, you did mention that in the last session i'm okay okay. what's what's happening at home on the homefront I am sort of curious to get sort of a newer update because. You did a really good job I know it was tough but you really sort of how to to have a pretty candid conversation and assertive conversation with your grandmother How are things going between the two of you."
12373.0,Patient,"i'm good I feels like we're a well oiled and mechanized again, you know we're working together again. yeah I feel I still feel like I can see myself living here for quite some time. Because I feel like at the end of the day, there's just less financial pressure on me because I don't have to pay rent. And it's just it's such a huge. aspect of me feeling kind of. generous to myself it's like well you know, at the end of the day, all you don't really have to worry about anything you have food on the table, you have a roof over your head so it's like it's nothing, nothing urgent is pressing down. You know, but. And you know my mental health and her mental health, they kind of fluctuate so it's like i'm trying to just be patient with both of us, but overall, I feel like it's been fairly good."
510.0,Provider,"Oh good it sounds like things are settling down because I know there were some Spikes. And really having to kind of have those conversations, but good Okay, and it sounds like you are working are things going okay with work and. Then steps relationships, I know there were many women who were interested and you are kind of considering but yeah."
12373.0,Patient,"it's that's one thing that's i've never been totally. Like romantic relationships is not something that i'm inclined to like pursue like with. Like a high on the priority list it's always something that I just kind of put back on the back burner like. yeah maybe it'll be in a relationship, maybe not but maybe it's because i'm just so comfortable being single that I just don't really. that's just my comfort zone so but part of me wants to like maybe take a risk and like invite someone on a picnic or something or just like you know just do something like that I don't know."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"But overall at work. it's. I had a really fun day, the other day we did 70s day. So I I picked out my my hair into like a huge Afro and like."
510.0,Provider,"I love it Oh, my goodness bell bottoms did he have the bell bottoms."
12373.0,Patient,"so hard to find here in northern California, so I. So I did a color scheme of. You know, like that 70s, like Beige Brown and gold."
510.0,Provider,The brow yeah yeah.
12373.0,Patient,Like the gold chains and the chest hair and. A half row and everyone was just like yes.
510.0,Provider,Ted Dan I always think of the headband right.
12373.0,Patient,I didn't.
510.0,Provider,"It wasn't that long ago I was born in the 70s. i'm Laura the 80s girl. retro but certainly the 80s or my thing but. Yes, oh I love it love it love it. Did you were you all playing 70s, like Funk music. hippie."
12373.0,Patient,"hippie well you know it is still coven time so I feel like the there's an undercurrent of depression just all throughout so. The few brave of us who the few of us were brave enough to do it, it was only like five people who actually did it. They were applauded. So it was it was funny for those who did it. I think I probably won the contest i'm not sure i'd have to check tomorrow but. um my managers loved it and yeah it was just a fun activity i'm glad I did it."
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"And in terms of the moving forward with. becoming part of the sign team. i'm there's a lot of chess pieces moving around it in the workplace right now we're you know we're losing we're getting new managers and there's a new store opening that's near so like a lot of pieces are shifting around so. it's kind of hard for me to get a word in in terms of like you know what can I do here so like i'm just waiting for things to kind of settle down a little bit, so I can kind of step in, but today, while I was doing some yard work for my grandma I thought of a good. proposal, which is that I can help organize and color Code, the. Some of the chalkboard signs, so that we can save time and energy with that so maybe I could just propose that, as a small entry level projects so that I can at least get some attention. With what i'm doing yeah."
510.0,Provider,Okay nice yeah sounds like things are going pretty well at work.
12373.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"What would you say are your biggest stressors right now, because I think before it was sort of the home environment just sort of kind of. getting things sort of settled, so your grandmother knew kind of where you were coming from, but what at this point in your life compared to when you first started bright her what do you think your biggest stressors are at this point."
12373.0,Patient,I would say just navigating where my grandmother is that emotionally every.
510.0,Provider,Day mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"So so that's a challenge and then also just kind of wondering what my financial situation could be you know because I. Because I have like 31,000 in student loan debt, but I haven't really touched and i'm kind of wondering, could I be doing more to address that situation because i'm I think pretty soon going to be paying pretty large payments towards that because i'm in a good financial situation here. So i'm just kind of wondering, you know what my financial situation could look like for the future, so probably grandma and the financial situation."
510.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, do you feel confident and being able to have the skills to to navigate do you. Think, so too yeah I definitely like I just i've seen the evolution like even in the short time I think your confidence level. has really I just been able to see it more. and finding your voice and that's a big part of what I like to try to help people do is find their voice, whether it's from a prior trauma whether it's asserting themselves with boundaries and feeling like they're kind of being pushed around a little bit. there's lots of ways we find our voice and that's always something I hope comes to light in therapy and you are definitely someone I have seen finding your voice and a stronger, more assertive way so good so glad to hear that you agree with that. yeah. i'm going to really miss chatting with you. yeah happy."
12373.0,Patient,"it's been an ideal therapy session i'm not expecting all therapists to be like this, so I got a good."
510.0,Provider,"I know it's and but The thing is, with therapists there's there's so many different ones out there, everyone has a different style and just I always tell people give. Give yourself a few sessions, though, because you might initially being like i'm not quite sure, and if that's the case that's okay just give give them at least a couple sessions, because it sometimes takes a little bit of time. There are times when people just immediately connect I get that I definitely get that but sometimes the rapport building takes a little time um so yeah cuz remind me I don't think you'd ever been in therapy is that right."
12373.0,Patient,Had a therapist once.
510.0,Provider,"Years ago, you did okay."
12373.0,Patient,"Okay, not not nearly as it was an under under performing underwhelming experience kind of a disappointing experience there wasn't some slight some slight help there, but just totally different time in my life totally different mindset. yeah that during that time of my life I probably wasn't even aware of how many resources at my disposal I just I just noticed that there was a therapy clinic near my home. In and just propose to get a therapist but didn't really have any particular goals in mind, but when I entered in bright heart, I did my homework I I."
510.0,Provider,knew are ready.
12373.0,Patient,intention. And a very specific intention.
510.0,Provider,He did.
12373.0,Patient,"And I you know I took some time browsing therapists on the. What is it called Blue Shield website, or whatever."
510.0,Provider,yeah. The provider Finder yeah. that's a good place to start uh huh.
12373.0,Patient,"Right, so I was just browsing and looking at different therapists but yeah I just totally different approach, this time, so."
510.0,Provider,"And that's a really good point, there are people who like as adolescents, they were shuttled to therapy right they're not looking to be. Like mom dad caregiver like you need to be in therapy. And I often would see those teams and then sometimes I would work with young adults. For the first time, when they were young adults and they're all and I would ask about their history and they're like oh yeah I was made to go to therapy, but that was a complete waste of time like they weren't wanting it right and it's."
12373.0,Patient,Tough.
510.0,Provider,"it's really tough parents are trying to like do the right thing by their kids. But that's what I was sort of thinking for you like you were in a different mindset different developmental time period not sure what you wanted to do, but this time around, you had very clear intentions. You see the difference right when you are really. You made the decision you have the goal, you made the intention way different what you put into it and what you get out of it. So it's a It is amazing, you tell people that they're like you know, but you really you're living proof you're a perfect example of that. yeah for sure good good i'm really glad that we've had the time. and know what else would you like to we can do a meditation I can I did a a loving kindness meditation in my groups, this week, just because I love meditation that's a big part of what I like to do but. I can take you through that. We can do what we can talk about if there, I mean I sort of feel like you're in a really sort of good place so i'm not sure. about any concern or stress, or you want to talk through but i'm i'm always happy to give you that time to."
12373.0,Patient,Know i'm totally totally open to a meditation.
510.0,Provider,"All right, this is personally one of my favorite so since you're not in group it's perfect I can bring it to you, so let me pull it up. We talked about self compassion this week and self compassion, is one of those things definitely knows really hard, we can. Often, be really impact that compassion to others, but we are asked to do it for ourselves. Even myself like Sometimes this is really hard to be kind and compassionate to oneself, so this is a loving kindness meditation So if you want you continue, you can continue to sit just sort of get comfortable. Go ahead and take two or three like inhalation breaths just to sort of get centered kind of loosen your shoulders and if you feel comfortable, you of course are welcome to close your eyes that you do not have to if you don't want to. And the purpose of this meditation is just to bring warmth and goodwill into your life and. Go ahead and take those two inhales and i'm going to do the same. All right now go ahead and put your hands over your heart to remind yourself that you are bringing not only attention but loving attention to your experience. feel the warmth of your hands the gentle pressure of your hands and feel how your chest rises and falls beneath your hands with every breath. It might feel like a while, but i'm going to give us about 30 seconds, and I just want you to kind of pay attention to this feeling the sensation high your chest rises and falls with each breath. Now I want you to bring a person or another living being, who naturally makes you smile. So bring to mind a person or other living being, who naturally makes you smile, this can be a child your grandmother your cat your dog whomever naturally brings happiness to your heart. Let yourself feel what it's like to be in that beings presence. allow yourself to enjoy the good company. now recognize how vulnerable this loved one is just like you, subject to sickness aging and even death. Also, this being wishes to be happy and free from suffering, just like you and every other living being. repeat softly and gently feeling the importance of your words and you're welcome to Sam out loud it's fine may be safe. may be peaceful. may be healthy. May you live with ease. If you notice that your mind has wander just gently return to the words and the image of the loved one you have in mind. savor any warm feelings that may arise. Go slow. may be safe. Maybe peaceful. Maybe healthy may you live with ease. Now I want you to add yourself to the circle of goodwill. continue to put keep your hand over your heart just continue to feel the warmth and gentle pressure of your hand. and say. May you and I be safe. May you and I be peaceful. May you and I be healthy. May you and I live with ease. Now I want you to visualize your whole body in your mind's eye. notice any stress or uneasiness that may be lingering within you. and offer kindness to yourself. May I be safe. May I be peaceful. May I be healthy. May I live with AIDS. Know take a few breaths and just rest quietly in your own body savoring the goodwill and compassion that flows naturally from your own heart. know that you can return to the phrases anytime you wish. May I be safe. May I be peaceful. Man be healthy. Man live with ease. And when you're ready you're welcome to open your eyes, can I rejoin our session. that's one of my favorite favorite meditations. What are your what are your thoughts were you able to settle in okay What was your experience like Jeffrey."
12373.0,Patient,Thank you for that that space.
510.0,Provider,yeah. looks like you got pretty relaxed pretty quickly.
12373.0,Patient,mm hmm. yeah there was a great grounding and. I needed that I missed it makes me miss doing that I would do groundings for my anti racist work. I haven't been involved in the anti racist groups for quite some time but that's one probably one of the biggest things I miss about it as being able to do the groundings.
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah when you do work like that you really. it's good that they would incorporate that because you really do need to sort of feel grounded, because sometimes it just yeah there's a lot of chaos and a lot of saw a lot of emotion and different things at play with that sort of work for sure."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah It makes me wonder i'm like I wonder, it feels like that could be. Something that can be in my daily life, like in a group setting. I wonder if someone some other people would be interested in just doing groundings maybe once a week or something."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah it's I mean it seems so simple that when we do that we're well we're immediately brought into the present moment which we know is. Excellent and so we're not you know lost in thought ahead of ourselves or kind of separating about our past and things that we can no longer you know change but yeah yeah. Do you feel comfortable sharing was there a particular person or entity that you. That just to your mind.
12373.0,Patient,I just for some reason I spontaneously thought of the deer that Rome this area just kind of a deer like a baby doe kind of wandering into.
510.0,Provider,yeah.
12373.0,Patient,And I have done some exploring in the area and sometimes i'll just wander off. into the woods and there's lots of deer you know just kind of watching me watching them and. You know just really gentle creatures just kind of minding their own business it's really beautiful.
510.0,Provider,"yeah I love that you were in nature, because nature is such an excellent point of contact for meditation and kind of being connected and grounded so that's great that that's sort of where you, you went. Nice yeah. You always have this meditation yeah this. Is the beautiful part of meditation is now with the digital media world, I mean you truly can find so many different. resources, which I think of when I was first trained and introduced to it. I mean the Internet didn't really exist. Like it's just amazing now. The level of availabilities so yeah so yeah I hope that you do think about that you seem to really settle in quite naturally and comfortably to. I know it's hard for people to sit still that you really have a calmness anything you recognize the power of stillness and that it's really important. Whereas some people they panic when they sit still don't like because they're so used to vibrating and I need to be moving if i'm not moving it's like a shark you know, a shark has to move because it dies. And people literally they're vibrating, so I think you're able to get still and there's a comfortable illness to that for you and i'm so glad you have that yeah. So continue to practice and hone that yeah."
12373.0,Patient,"Totally and I think and even for people who are inclined to do that when I get still in front of other people, it can be embarrassing, but I tell myself, you know accept accept that you're embarrassed that you're being still accept that this is not. socially acceptable accept that this is not mainstream and let that bring you deeper you know."
510.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely and honestly with the world and all the different things that are going on. i'm sure you've been around people that are somewhat chaotic and they're just like whoa you can just almost feel the energy of just chaos and they're just really distressed. When you are that piece, and you are that still nights you emanate that right, and so it becomes I really believe in energy, and I hope this is not too hokey for you, but I believe in energy, and so, if you emanate that. People will respond and so, if you emanate chaos guess what it will feed into chaos and then you have more chaos, so when you are when you are that piece, and you are that stillness it's a gift because hopefully then others can be like oh. So, good for you, yes it's just a thought about the embarrassment it doesn't even necessarily need to be true right we know it's a judgment thoughts and just you do what you do. yeah I."
12373.0,Patient,"really appreciate you bringing me into that space and. yeah I definitely feels like something that could it's like something that I need that I could. Take seize the opportunity to do. To help me stay engaged with you know stillness and presence, you know, maybe I could start like a grounding session once a week with some people I don't know."
