10.0,Provider,hi Lawrence. Sorry i'm late. How are you doing. yeah. What brings you to bright heart and how can I be of service.
15991.0,Patient,I need to stop drinking. quite a bit to. overcome to do that. Depression. My wife has been. My biggest problem like. My biggest problem now.
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so you got depression you got anxiety you're grieving your wife, which is the biggest issue and you need to stop drinking."
15991.0,Patient,yeah.
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so tell me a little bit about your drinking like when did you start and how."
15991.0,Patient,"A little bit, but when. You go to. Happy hour with you ever today. i've been in the hospital. Two or three times for. These. what's this."
10.0,Provider,Okay.
15991.0,Patient,And friend of mine recommended you guys.
10.0,Provider,yeah it looks like you've been you were seeing doctor Allah Dag. And she had started some medication for you is that right. yeah and was the medication helping you.
15991.0,Patient,"whoa. out and started drinking again. i've. been trying to get. Things organized, so I don't miss meeting, but I guess I missed a couple of appointments."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so. when's the last time you drank. You haven't drank for two days. No and are you feeling shaky. Let me see your hand, can you put your hand out. But it, so I can see it. Okay. So here's the deal, I think that I can help you once you get through the initial detox. But you if you've already been to the hospital two times for dts. i'm concerned that you might need a little bit of a more attention, while you're going through the initial detox, what do you think."
15991.0,Patient,well. I would open up the hospital again. kind of embarrassing.
10.0,Provider,"I understand, and you know what I think. With this is self compassion you're doing the best you can I know it's challenging to go to the emergency room and there's a lot of stigma and whatnot. But you know you're you're. you're doing the right thing you know you're asking for help to get off the alcohol. So I think if you haven't drank for to two days, and it seems like you're pretty shaky right now, you might be headed into some significant alcohol withdrawal."
15991.0,Patient,well.
10.0,Provider,"So. I mean you, you have kind of some options, you know you could go to the emergency room and have them treat you for the acute alcohol withdrawal and then come out and then we can work together here bright heart. or another option would be to consider going into more of a residential program initially."
15991.0,Patient,I can't afford to do that one.
10.0,Provider,You don't have any insurance.
15991.0,Patient,Not a cow.
10.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean they should have some. Some detox available. covered by medicare where do you live."
15991.0,Patient,I live in. California.
10.0,Provider,"I can have someone call you to figure out what kind of options, you have for a residential program it's covered by medicare. In your county or like I said, you can go to emergency have them taper you off they'll probably give you some medication to help wean off the alcohol. and control your withdrawal and then, once you get out we be i'd be happy to work with you give you more medication and help get to the root of the issue, which is. You know clearly about your your mood your anxiety you're grieving and there's probably other things underneath that need to be addressed."
15991.0,Patient,Oh.
10.0,Provider,But I think right now it's it's hard for me to. To provide adequate care over the Internet for you. Does that make sense.
15991.0,Patient,yeah.
10.0,Provider,"yeah so. i'm encouraging you to stay away from the alcohol, but you need to get a little bit more. close follow up right now, during this transition. Do you live alone. know who do you live with."
15991.0,Patient,son. Here in my house and then I have my daughter and. In another house on my property and a. My one of my son axes and another house on about the.
10.0,Provider,yeah i'm concerned that that might not be. The best environment for the type of care that you need right now. What do you think.
15991.0,Patient,"I can drink a glass of water, without filling it on me now and. So i'm. just going to go as long as I can, without going to the hospital. well."
10.0,Provider,"The concern is that if you if you wait too long, you might start having seizures."
15991.0,Patient,yeah I understand that you.
10.0,Provider,Had that before.
15991.0,Patient,"i've never happened before, no."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, when you say dts what What do you mean."
15991.0,Patient,couldn't stop taking. A. really great thing. Like I said I couldn't drink a glass of water drive a lot of cigarette and break them.
10.0,Provider,"yeah. Lawrence I really suggest that you go to the hospital and get taken care of through the detox because it could be dangerous, you can actually die from alcohol withdrawal. So I admire you wanting to try to do it on your own, but this is something that medically you need you need more support."
15991.0,Patient,Okay.
10.0,Provider,"So. Would you be willing to go to the hospital this one last time and then, when you get out. i'd be happy to work with you and help you stay sober."
15991.0,Patient,"Or, without going to the floor. it's. It was on with you when I really got real bad. and The last period I hadn't been drinking whiskey I was drinking beer and."
10.0,Provider,"How much beer, are you drinking."
15991.0,Patient,Drinking coke. Or the 30 day.
10.0,Provider,24 beers. Okay yeah so Lawrence even though you think you can do it on your own I strongly discouraged you to try that because. You could be in really serious danger.
15991.0,Patient,"Well, I feel like I get to that point."
10.0,Provider,"yeah but i'm what i'm saying is it might be too late, if you wait. If you start going into severe alcohol withdrawal and you have a seizure and I don't know who's around there to keep an eye on you and you'd have to you know, to call an ambulance and wait for an ambulance to get there and then try to get you to the hospital. That doesn't sound like a safe plant. Okay, as long as you understand that you're going against what i'm recommending for you. Are you. Do you know where you are right now."
15991.0,Patient,My office in my house.
10.0,Provider,"Okay, and what's your full name. what's your date of birth. What year are we in."
15991.0,Patient,one.
10.0,Provider,"Okay. well. I mean it sounds like you're you're competent to make your own decisions and all I can say is that I I don't. I don't think it's safe for you to try this on your own I will send some medication some more gather penton. Just to. You know minimize any harm. But. Again, my strong recommendation is that you go to the hospital to. To get treatment right now. I am sending the medicine to. Okay. and The rite aid on East as."
