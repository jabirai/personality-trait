480.0,Provider,At least paying for it all.
15690.0,Patient,"um I don't think so. Well um she says she's gonna vote for that and then he says she's gonna try and see if the front if they can like demolish the front and fix it, I guess, I don't know how that works."
480.0,Provider,But have you only demolish the front of the House.
15690.0,Patient,"I do not know that she said, unless i'm wrong, but she says she's just going to see if she can get the front of the House right she can get the front of the House right then she possibly, but I just I don't think that's gonna happen because of the whole House shifted. How would it still be what. exactly like what integrity like."
480.0,Provider,It wouldn't have all it seems like there would be a foundational issue with the whole how shifted they'd have to redo the whole foundation you can't do that with just taking off like the front of the House.
15690.0,Patient,dancer I was thinking. going to give her my hopes probably.
480.0,Provider,"Go ahead, has it been. Like extra stress having her live with you, or is it helpful to have an extra adult."
15690.0,Patient,"Oh no it's fine she's fine. she's so she wakes up and the first thing she does is for breakfast so is stuff like that, let me probably. I think I remember telling you I forgot what session until June, but that whole I know what it is now it's called karasu MIA. MIA. That condition the whole smell thing."
480.0,Provider,"Oh Oh, do you still have that going on."
15690.0,Patient,yeah it's gotten it's gotten worse.
480.0,Provider,So you've alone now at all.
15690.0,Patient,"No, I have smell like i'm not sure okay so like I did the research and then I just found out what it was i'm like when you got coven some people when they got coven they lost their senses they gained their senses and then for a lot of people, not a lot, but of large group of people. When they lost the census and regains it there, how do you say the olfactory thing right here smell. The neurons or whatever their homes got messed up so after like maybe two months of you, having your smell back things start to smell distorted so like were you smell cooking hamburger I will smell Burke garbage. Because it's um it just destroyed all those neurons up there, the nurse nurse or something like that. yeah so I have to like they there's really no cure for it. and They said what else they say you could you can only just try to do olfactory senses training."
480.0,Provider,So pretty old they're not going to like rebuild themselves.
15690.0,Patient,They then. It can the nerves can like rebuild and stuff but you what you can do to speed up the proper process is try to like sent training.
480.0,Provider,"And what is that, just like smelling random things."
15690.0,Patient,"yeah smelling random things, but they also say use essential oils like. essential oils for like a couple seconds in the daytime in the morning and then the same thing at night for like two three months you use the same smells. Then, if you haven't seen any progress try another sense, and this continued process until you smell is back and everybody has their different home remedy treatments and stuff like that, but that treatment, I saw for a loss doctor and stuff but it's gotten very it's gotten worse."
480.0,Provider,Like really bad hard to eat since you're having all these weird cells.
15690.0,Patient,"is very hard to eat on a lot of people say us know slugs but then it's hard to eat, then, and they want to take off the nose plug I all of a sudden get a wolf have all of that smell. That I just ate because you know it's on my mouth and then my hands and everything, so I end up almost throwing that up so. Either I don't know how you guys do it what it keep the thing on and then go brush my teeth and have to do all that and then it's like eating with sickness, because you can't you can't breathe. It has gotten worse now that and when people start to cook or even when I took since I can't really taste the food I can't like you can only go off of memory like this is how you. And when I was cooking chicken, the other day Oh, my goodness, I was like smells rotten might as well, throw it away let's just. It smells good as I just throw it away like a whole House I wake up grandma's cooking and i'm just like oh like I can't do this, and this guy i've lost I was at 256 and now i'm at 239 within a week and a half, because of it."
480.0,Provider,Oh no.
15690.0,Patient,"it's, not only because of that, like, I went also to the doctors and i'm going to colleges. And i've been trying to lose weight for a minute now, but I was like I was one time, I was like heavy into like eating good out and everything. And i'm just like Why am I not losing weight like this is so weird so I find those are going to college is a gynecologist tells me that I possibly have PCs."
480.0,Provider,Oh now.
15690.0,Patient,"Though I um they did the arm internal ultrasound and everything was fine no sister anything on it, but I still. Like a few of the other symptoms so she was like i'm so treat you for it to see if we can get it down and then you'll be fine. I started taking metformin the medicine they prescribe to me and metformin it says there's triggering foods and the only eight are the triggering foods. So it's like."
480.0,Provider,Oh no.
15690.0,Patient,"What in the world, I can't eat spicy food off of it but spicy foods are pretty much the only thing I can eat on what with the pros MIA. and it's been hard."
480.0,Provider,"Can you do sorry, can you do like meal replacement shakes or anything or those do the same thing."
15690.0,Patient,"that's exactly what i'm going to do i'm pretty sure that some of them are probably going to taste bad, but I figure, if I can just drink something down real quick just to make sure that i'm eating healthy then. You know it's just gonna have to be smoothies and meal shakes for a good time, so my back or something stops or something or I don't have to take metformin anymore."
480.0,Provider,How long do you have to take that did she give you any idea.
15690.0,Patient,"she's gonna have another appointment in eight weeks. Okay, so she's gonna see if i'm because she said, my testosterone with a little high. And that's why she gave it to me. Everything we're good check out fine she's like everything down his spine is perfect, but since that you, since you have these other symptoms we're still going to try and treat for it. But yeah it's like really hard."
480.0,Provider,"That is really hard so are you feeling like Okay, so when I think of people not able to eat normally the symptoms associated with not eating like do you get headaches, are you feeling weak and fatigued all of that."
15690.0,Patient,"Here um. I eat but very little, and what I do eat is like rice and hot sauce. Okay, or eggs, I can eat eggs or bread it's like I get you the starch."
480.0,Provider,"So things that don't have a lot of for Labor anyways. Yes, yeah. Oh, my gosh."
15690.0,Patient,"yep it definitely is, and I mean it's everything I smelt perfumes smell bad they don't smell good now if it has a hint of vanilla in it, I could smell the vanilla, hence the essential oils, so I think that essential oils will work. But it's really sad because it's literally had the overwhelm the other day I was just like everything's kind of sucking right now and i'm feeling a little bit. depressed and sad because it's overwhelming that I was just like everything around me it's just feels like not very not liking it."
480.0,Provider,"yeah for sure So then, when you get days like that, where you're depressed and overwhelmed, how do you cope with that."
15690.0,Patient,"i'm past couple times, the other day, while my sister was sleeping or sister my kids were in their living room and my boyfriend was gone I pretty much stayed in bed and cried. went back to bed. yeah. It helps out a release. i'm."
480.0,Provider,Really.
15690.0,Patient,"Oh, I just I really want to get in shape one thing. And if. i'm trying to fix it. it's like i'm trying to do them at forum, and so I can lose the weight is one of the things it's the PCs causes, this is hard for you to lose weight."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I didn't know that okay."
15690.0,Patient,"And then I am losing weight, but the wrong way. So it's just like. I don't know. I don't know. But I guess I can just go smoothies eat smoothies so i'm forced to eat healthy and you. don't know well, and the reason I was thinking some sort of meal replacement like that is, if you use a straw, then."
480.0,Provider,Your taste buds like if you put the straw towards the back of your mouth you're not tasting it as much right.
15690.0,Patient,"Well it's not in the taste the property is nothing with the taste, is to smell. The smell like that's why they say when you cover, like the other day, probably two days ago I was door dashing and I was like oh so."
480.0,Provider,Your door dashing to.
15690.0,Patient,"write a whole so hungry, I went to this place is Chinese place it so really good egg rolls so I got to egg rolls and I was like come on it's just cabbage and you know and stuff like that it should be fine. is worse with me so should be fine Oh, my goodness, did I do it to myself so i'm like well have to eat so screw it, so I held my know like this and easy moment I let go and I smelt it, I was like."
480.0,Provider,Oh no sorry you actually throwing up when that happens.
15690.0,Patient,yeah throw throw food because it smells like rotten poop.
480.0,Provider,Just so bad.
15690.0,Patient,"Someone else, it can be something smells but all it's all bad. yeah."
480.0,Provider,yeah so it's not like you have an egg roll that smells like a sugar cookie like it's all bad bad bad now.
15690.0,Patient,"it's all bad smells. Like justin are going to talk and just put for me and. Then you'll see all the people will just pop up. Like Kobe after Kobe what is like, and some people are like depressed and. A some people use an old plugs but I said I use an old phone for that time it felt like I was sick, so it feels like a chore to eat now. yeah oh no."
480.0,Provider,"that's so weird huh. Okay, so let's think of some coping skills, you can use in the coming weeks, when you start to feel depressed because I imagine, especially around the holidays it's not fun feeling sick and not being able to eat. yeah So what are some coping skills that work for you, aside from just like crawling and Brendan and crying because that's a good one. And also. Sometimes that's not super effective."
15690.0,Patient,it's not at all I just or just go to sleep that way don't think about it.
480.0,Provider,"So actually i'm a big fan of sleeping as a coping skill, because a lot of times when you go to sleep, if you have some sort of emotional experience that's really intense, by the time you wake up, at least the intensity is gone right. So I don't think that's a terrible coping skills sleep can be one of them. But what are some other ones that maybe we can try out."
15690.0,Patient,"Only other thing that suits me or calms me. Watch something like I love, a lot of fantasy shows. Okay me out of where i'm at right now. into that one thing."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so in the coming weeks, when you're feeling sad or stressed you're going to escape by either sleeping or watching some sort of fantasy show."
15690.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,that's a good goal.
15690.0,Patient,Are you.
480.0,Provider,ready for Christmas.
15690.0,Patient,yeah ish. was ever really ready. I don't even think the rich people who have it all together they don't got it all but you'd have the money to get it together God is together.
480.0,Provider,yeah no no i'm Scott together.
15690.0,Patient,No.
480.0,Provider,"No, no Christmas morning is when everything finally you're like okay i'm ready because i'm out of time."
15690.0,Patient,yep. yep. But we'll have it ready by then that's usually how it happens.
480.0,Provider,You see your boys at all.
15690.0,Patient,No. know they only want me to send letters. Which is fine.
480.0,Provider,Have you been doing that regularly.
15690.0,Patient,"I told my boyfriend I sent them I haven't doing it regularly, but this past month i've been writing notes, I have like a little bucket of like for notes now. That i'm."
480.0,Provider,I.
15690.0,Patient,Just was like are they reading or they're just throwing it away. Am I sounding. And i'm just like an over thinker.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and it's vulnerable to be sending letters like that, and like you said you don't know if they're reading them you don't know what they're thinking because it's not like a conversation."
15690.0,Patient,No i'm not getting anything back.
480.0,Provider,that's gonna be so hard. huh okay so something that might be an idea for if you're feeling really anxious about that is write a response you would want to get so like basically writing to yourself. As if they were responding to you.
15690.0,Patient,"Okay. i'm pretty sure that's gonna make me cry to. Actually, writing, what I want them to say or hoping, they would say or thinking, they were saying."
480.0,Provider,"it's okay to cry because it's a sad situation. But also the days when you're already stressed and overwhelmed or not, the times to do that. Okay, because that's like divot digging up trauma, because this is a source of trauma so. that's something that once like life is kind of settled you're regularly using coping skills, then that's when we kind of get into doing that. yeah. Okay, so as far as appointments going forward I believe our next one is next Monday already right at 11. yeah yes Okay, so I do want to schedule january's just because. I have a new planner that's January. Okay, so 11 o'clock next Monday. And then. i'm not working, the following week so, then we could do Monday, the third and Monday the 17th. And I don't have any appointment scheduled anytime those days, yet so you pretty much have your pick do you want to keep it at 11 to 1130 later earlier."
15690.0,Patient,Oh no that's fine 1130 is fine.
480.0,Provider,"So the third and the 17th and 1130. Yes, perfect. And then. everything's good medication wise right heart wise. yeah okay cool. All right, well, I hope that you have a good week. And i'm going to research, some of that. spell it for me real quick."
15690.0,Patient,um PA R O s MIA MIA.
480.0,Provider,Okay got it. i'm going to research that. and sounds miserable i'm so sorry.
15690.0,Patient,I know it sucks.
480.0,Provider,"i'll try to enjoy your week and I will see you at group. Already oh wow that's tomorrow. All right, take care i'll see you soon. bye. Okay, so for a short term goals, please put. utilize saline and TV as coping skills. Also, continue to write letters to children. and write a letter to herself, as if it were a response from her children, so what she would want them to say back to her. And I think that's it Okay, thank you."
