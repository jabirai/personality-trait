5998.0,Patient,"My old doctor for brighter house Dr. Jill oh my gosh she was cool yeah Dr Craig yeah she told me I stopped, I know I can't sign it no i'm talking to and that's it, you know if you have to go to medical records in actually serious. So um yeah the question just so they will like how much time it takes. Like the mobile medical and the other agencies, you know it takes time for."
724.0,Provider,"It oh yeah Of course I would imagine that that those people that work in medical records know how long this type of stuff takes. Like you know a lot of times it has to be cleared through insurance, like the whole medical process is super time consuming and bureaucratic it takes forever nothing happens on a timeframe that you would expect. A normal thing that it just doesn't know what I mean like so you have one thing to get signed but there might be like 50 people before you that they just had one thing that needed to be signed, and that happens every day, you know, then you like they're. You know these doctors here there are facilitating groups are writing prescriptions for hundreds of people across different state, you know what I mean it's as i'm sure everybody's been."
5998.0,Patient,"One paper that's all I have it right here so. I had to even write a letter to go to the job site, you know I wrote a letter and I don't know do fasting shit so I want you to fedex, and I mean and I got all this shit done by myself and wow. it's a habit right here. yeah it's right here, mobile medical it's a yeah it's one signature on the bottom that's all take a look at it wow one signature director and all it is, is that I mean counseling. Another piece of work, people test is that the first one, I gave him everything i'm came up multiple medical my whole history of heart health they don't some private information and that guys to do, he goes, you went beyond he goes yeah he will shoot we're gonna creep you know."
724.0,Provider,This.
5998.0,Patient,"This paper here that's it does get assigned and he says yeah it's going to take a couple days, he told me he told me this yesterday."
724.0,Provider,"And it's like business it's not like. yeah it's not like oh. I never when it comes when it comes to dealing with like medical paperwork and all kinds of stuff like that I don't expect anything to happen in a timely fashion, it just doesn't know it's across the board everywhere that you go just the life."
5998.0,Patient,"Of the contract i'm working for like, then I have to sit down with the safety people. what's all of them and have me with them and then they're going to look at me drug test, like all the time yeah no."

Sound taking drug test right now man, I took one yesterday. I don't like him clean yeah and then the box him taking yeah you know which."
724.0,Provider,"Which are which are prescribed so you don't have to worry about you know about them thinking that you're taking stuff illicitly you have documentation and you will have continued documentation that shows that you're prescribing medication so. yeah it's a see. The bureaucracy part of it, and the you know, the lack of. You know expedition on a lot of stuff that we want it just doesn't happen like like in the medical field everything takes forever, nothing is in a timely fashion, nothing is ever on our time. You know, it takes, you know takes me months to get appointments sometimes like be like okay I got this thing that I need to get worked on. Like Okay, and the next point that I have is in November literally even for my daughter who's not attached to the va.

724.0,Provider,"yeah it'll populate that for a little bit because, like I said earlier, it's new like you've never done anything like that, before so your body isn't acclimated to it, yet, but over time, it will you know what I mean it'll just the more you do it, the more your body will adjust to it."
5998.0,Patient,"I think they told me, I was in time, your body will adjust but it's not that Ben he told me that they're diving in he touched a shark like big ass fucking white Great White ship. The great white sharks. and dolphins. dolphins comes up to them, you know they play with him, you know."

5998.0,Patient,yeah I like. That cost a lot of learning to do this year bro yeah. You know I mean a cheap.
724.0,Provider,"Well, I think, once you have all your equipment, you know what I mean like that that cost is pretty much done and, if you have somebody with you all the time. Like you don't have to pay to go to like to go dive you know. stuff like that, like if you're certified and you have the equipment and you can do whatever you want, but it's important that you have somebody with you so like probably the hardest thing for you would be. Finding somebody that you go dive with like all the time, or like recreationally you'd have to make connections with people where you're at now the setup like like dive meats, or you know little trips and stuff like that weekend trips."
5998.0,Patient,"it's all the diving in Santa Rosa it's pretty man its water so clear if and if you're in your wetsuit and it feels a little bit cold, but other than that oh man you're good."
724.0,Provider,Is there anywhere else to dive where you're at other than the whole.

What the divers had to like wear and then how they got the kids like through these like camera and so like. Completely Brown and black out situations where they couldn't see so that like literally moving like a weird thing like it's so claustrophobic and it was just nuts and i'm shocked that more people didn't die during the race. what's that."
