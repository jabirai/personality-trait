But for the most part, if you were to tell me something. i'm not going to remember. What you owe me, depending on how focus I am on you. So you directly, and I keep contact on on you and I, I listen closely. I get. Remember what you're saying, but for the most part, somebody will tell me something and then automatically it feels like I didn't hear them correctly. And all i'll ask them to repeat themselves so when they do that name some people usually tend to get aggravated so the repeated to me again and then i'll still forget, for some reason, I still forget what they told me exactly. and I are getting into one of those modes, where I feel like. anxiety and TIM in this not a heavy anxiety, but some. small amount of anxiety, where I feel like oh man i'm going to get in trouble if I go back and ask them again what they said but I don't.

17628.0,Patient,Yes.
324.0,Provider,"I need the calls that were supposed to be put in the dryer. listening. So that's that's my criteria there in the DSM five. And that's the criteria to diagnose ADHD and you identify with 12345. Yes, i've invited all my movies. So here's my thing. I would. really, really, really like you go ahead and have left. Okay, done. um if you do not have a monitor to monitor your blood pressure, I know Amazon has had some. pharmacies will have one yeah I think Amazon likely 20 foot. Okay um. Because I do want you to keep an eye on two things your blood pressure in your heart rate. Because the medications will be asking what's can cause an increase so there's you know there's a concern there. So let me. kind of go over the. medications and what what how they work in and what's going on, so you have to chemicals in your brain don't mean i'm not going to turn this into science class but don't be an order never. um. So these are chemicals that two messages different parts of the brain and the body with the medications do. They help improve your attention and our focus i'm fine helping these brain chemicals work better. And the medications. target these two brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine. And these are the chemicals that affect. A person's attention and concentration and focus. um. You have ADHD this. Combined up a combination of inattentiveness. And hyperactivity. Or you have you can have just have a problem in attention or focus because i'll have people just say look i'm having problems with focusing I can't concentrate, but they don't really have the issue with being hyper or visiting. So it. kind of depends, do you find yourself, because you did say you say here, do you think it's a combination."
17628.0,Patient,yeah I think it's a combination.
324.0,Provider,of being able to steal.

You know, I find it hard to sit down sometimes the only time I actually sit down is when i'm playing video games, you know cuz, I guess, maybe because i'm fidgeting in that time you know. Most part yeah constantly move around."
324.0,Provider,"let's see what. Looking at and i'ma tell you that sometimes it takes trial and error. and by that I mean to find a combination that works for you. starting off. Let me say this, you have. different classes of medications you're. You know, you have the means, and then you have a little bit of. The permission to work. When I say work better, but they're more happy more effective, because they target both the domain and the corporate different enterprise. where's the mental dinner dates. nothing wrong they work. With target just the. don't for me. Usually those tend to be more first choice in like children analysis. started ghost would be. five milligrams. twice a day. And it can be increased weekly. again. everyone's a little different um I recommend start, not on the immediate release there's an option to switch over to an extended release release last an average of 10 to 12 hours. per day. Side effects. could be insomnia headaches for decreased appetite. abdominal pain weight loss. Possible agitation."
17628.0,Patient,So just look out for those things.
324.0,Provider,"Definitely. notice yourself feeling more jewelry. Effects 5% to resolve. Maybe something that's initial you might experience, but again. it's not common but possible, I mentioned the heart rate and increase in heart rate. increases blood pressure.

17628.0,Patient,"I can have 20. that's right, it was almost 60 seconds."
324.0,Provider,"let's try that again. Okay, and. Okay 123 star. So you like to say you're going to want to you know, keep an eye on your heart rate. If you're noticing that it's starting to. purchase is your rather than anything right now for the next couple days. kind of drop date, remember, let me see what my heart rate is. That when you kind of. have an idea of what your heart rate is now versus when you start."
17628.0,Patient,That it actually shows your heart rate plus your oxygen level.
324.0,Provider,Oh postdocs okay yeah it definitely does that too okay.
17628.0,Patient,Does it show me as a blood pressure.
324.0,Provider,Okay.
17628.0,Patient,All right.
324.0,Provider,"Now the other thing as far as. That might be could be an issue. or something sometimes insurance into a hard time. And they. require a report card authorization, so what you will do is when I send the prescription automatically. Say hey I just sent this new prescription and we might be a product that was bullying. and tackle it. i'm. Like I say, if you can. see if we can get an appointment."
17628.0,Patient,that's. When once. resentments.
324.0,Provider,"and go ahead and have those done that way I can kind of see you know, take a look at my lab work, and this is the like your basic. cholesterol level by level a CDC Akin panel thyroid. If there's anything abnormal their. Program. And shira is fearful on our care navigators she's gonna come to them. Okay, she she's actually. Okay, so I need to. know. What we're discussing here um so the structure of the Program. They explained, like the individual therapy sessions and the group therapy sessions. that are required. within a month ago, so you."
17628.0,Patient,Know i'm not sure.
324.0,Provider,"OK OK individual therapy is twice a month, the group therapy sessions or weekly. My groups are all on Tuesdays. So, think about a time that that would work for you. Not 9am 11am or PM and 6pm."
17628.0,Patient,To 11am. Usually last.
324.0,Provider,About 15 minutes.
17628.0,Patient,50 or 50.
324.0,Provider,"050. All right, but. But no more than 50. i'm. A lover night, you know. Do you have like. here's your archive that."
17628.0,Patient,yeah I actually. I was going to do this meeting from my computer my wife just sent me up on the phone. Okay now.
324.0,Provider,"For the individuals like with me today you don't have earphones on best perfectly that's okay before the group's because there are other Members, President for confidentiality and all that. bright heart is made for requirements that you have to have some type of fear that. or they'll you know, ask you to leave i'm not driving during any appointments. And for the live sessions when you're in your individual I say. it's up to you, if you have others around. You okay with that before the group sessions we do ask that you try to be like in a row, when you don't have. You know others in the room, with you. Again, for confidentiality. Okay, so let's see tuesday's 11. um what the plan would be is, if I can have. Some laughs and by then. We can go ahead and get started, and it would be like I say. takes trying different those to see will work with you, but the start anytime you start any medication you start off on a lower so so definitely be the five milligrams twice a day. And then, after a week, you can increase it in five milligram increments we can have up to 10 1520. and see how are you doing. Like I say the goal would be to have some laughs but to say that we're looking for him, you know it started."
17628.0,Patient,"Today, about or they walk in or do you actually have to set up an appointment."
324.0,Provider,i'm.
17628.0,Patient,Because I have an eight yet so I mean i'm so technically fasting okay.
