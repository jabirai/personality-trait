And we all slept like crap because we left, we were going to leave Friday, but we just had a lot going on, we weren't packed I was out all day with my neighbor shopping with my daughter, and her daughter. So we love Saturday, and we were going to set the nicer hotel, but everything was packed because. They have the apple festival back home, where we went we went to Vancouver Ohio which is like right by like indiana Ohio border. i'm so we went with a cheaper hotel and then bed sucked so. I woke up josh and I was like crying in my sleep all night, and I remember waking up at like seven in the morning in my back for. so bad, but I don't think my back, I even was crying because it hurts so bad, so I sat out against the headboard and it really helped my back the lot better, but when I woke up I woke up a couple hours later, it was like 10 because we had to check out Sunday morning. I just had this really bad headache and it was just like how the back of my head and usually, when I get a headache like that I don't know if it was like a migraine maybe, but I just feel like really hot in my face and like right here, I kind of feel like I get a fever, maybe i'm. too easy, by the time I went to bed last night and it's like back again today.

It was crazy i've never seen anything like it, the kids were pretty excited excellent. yeah it was cool. And then Saturday night. The original reason we were going is because. josh had went to this school there that was built in the 1700s it was actually a church. For the priests in the nuns they went there, well then, in the 1800s they chopped it down from a three story building to a two story building and they opened it up as a school. Well josh his mom that went there when she was little and then josh went there from I think you said, like kindergarten a third grade. and it's been closed for a long time, but I guess they do like. paranormal investigations there, and so, because it's haunted so this guy was so nice he came over he met us. It was around five and we all wait in the school which my daughter did not want to go in, but she did. So the first floor like you know it's been sitting empty for so long, like. The walls are kind of messed up, you know that type of thing you know it's just creepy you know well, the first four wasn't so bad, but when we got up to the second floor. I just felt real and easy like I got it just feel like there was like a breakout ice laying across my arm in one of the rooms and then in another room I my chest felt like really heavy. It was weird so after we went upstairs me and Leah and josh is break bromo went outside and josh and Liam and curtis and his mom went down in the basement. So they were doing the basement and. His mom felt like someone was standing behind her, she thought it was one of the kids nobody was standing behind her and. The dude had turned on like a voice box and they heard so in saying hello and held it was so crazy and then they heard they thought we had came back in the building and they heard a door slam and they heard but slack footsteps and they got scared game outside. They were like did you guys come back here and i'm like no, we were like. So it was creepy. I was like i'm glad I wasn't in there for that, because I probably would have. peed myself or something oh yeah. Oh."

She said that there was like creepers crawling on the wall like basically like a bad spirit type thing and i'm just like and that's the room that my my chest like felt really heavy and it i'm like oh i'm getting the hell out of the school.

Oh fabulous. moments on I know it was nice and then my oldest stop by. I think it was it was Thursday night. He came by to let me know to go see my dad. I guess, he was just over there recently, so you know, like when Y2K was going to happen and they thought like we weren't going to have electricity and all that crap a long time ago. yeah well I dad got a whole bunch of barrels and some of them had gas in it, and some of it had watering and then he, like stocked up on like. Like ready meals and like vegetables and like canned goods and all that. well. James had went over there to help them mtl the water barrels because he wanted to get rid of him. he's like mom he's like your dad is just like skin and bones he's not doing good he's like I don't know if you've talked at Nikki because he's the one that lives with my sister. he's like but you should go and see your dad in. Just hearing that I was just like oh my God that's not a good, so I was going to go see on Friday. But so after school well in the mornings, and then after school. One of our neighbors little girl is really close with Liam. So I take them to the bus stop she'll drop her daughter off and then i'll take him to the bus stop and then I pick them up after school and they come here and so her mom gets offers for dad or whatever. So she picked me up Friday morning and her daughter, and then Leah we all went shopping so Healy said, we were going to bath and body works and raw so i'm like Okay, I have plenty of time to go see my dad and stuff and then I was going to come home and Pack and we're going to leave. Well, she had us out until like six o'clock at night so i'm like well we're not leaving tonight, so, but then I was going to go see my dad and I was just like it's late so. I go over there today and see how he's doing yeah."
540.0,Provider,Are you gonna end up getting the kids bringing them or just what do you.
9916.0,Patient,"See I just I don't know if I should I just don't know. I don't think my dad would be mad about it, I don't know. But then again i'm just like well you know I don't want to scare them with toby and you know yeah no. But I mean I I would my you know wouldn't mind taking them because you don't really get to see my youngest three so. I don't know I think I should just go see him first. yeah yeah let me."
540.0,Provider,see him. And then.
9916.0,Patient,"But that's The thing is, like my sister don't even tell me how my dad is in which I know I should be responsible for that, too, I just feel. I just feel out of place when I go there ever since my dad got with Kelly my step mom it's just doesn't like feel like home anymore it's not like. You know, a childhood home when you grow up in the home, you can go back and your parents are there, and you know you can stay a weekend, or you know, whatever it's just not that way I don't know that. I know my dad's always nice, you know he's cool but. I don't know. we've always had kind of like. A rough relationship. yeah. It more so was after my mom died, you know I don't he just He threw himself into work, he was a Barber during the day and then he had night jobs, all the time it like warehouses and stuff so really wasn't around a lot and then he got into martial arts. Just to keep himself busy, which I understand now you know I think that's his way of coping through it to know. And I wasn't the best teenagers, you know I wasn't I didn't listen I you know, I was the hard headed one it's just I remember, at a point where I had to live with my dad and just for a couple months. And I had my oldest to have my third oldest and then I had like four is it my course oldest my daughter my other daughter, and my dad let me stay in his garage which is like he turned it into like an apartment or whatever. It was just hard living there, it just was not my step mom was like. Making up shit to piss my dad off and always down his bag, like all they need to go and it's not like. And then I remember going in the House, one day. And my dad was like well I just don't have time for you and Nikki shit no more, I have a new family. And I just feel like after that. You know, he knows he's never been to see my apartments or houses wherever i've lived he doesn't call, which I know you should call your parents, you should be the one to call your berridge I get that but then again i've heard."
540.0,Provider,both ways.
9916.0,Patient,"So yeah I feel like. Parents to call their kids too, because I call my my kids like all the time I bought them like hey what's going on, or you know, even if they don't respond i'm still in their ass trying to get Ahold of them. You know just to see how they're doing. But I don't know he just I know he has his own thing going on but. Have you."
540.0,Provider,"talked to him, since he said that like he started his like new like."
9916.0,Patient,"Family oh. No, that was some years ago that was years ago but. And then we went through a period of where we didn't talk, because when I was living there at that time my husband, who I was waiting. stole my mom's camera I didn't know he did it he stole her camera and pawned it, I guess, like, I found this out like after we broke up and all that stuff well my dad's like well i'm gonna disown you and this matt and it's just been. it's been really rocky with my dad so then it's like some points to me like I dread going over there to see him, but then again, I know that I need to go see you. I don't know it, so I know."
540.0,Provider,"And I think it's hard, because you have a complex dynamic with your dad versus it's not it's not the relationship that obviously you probably want. But. I mean, maybe seeing how it is and then."
9916.0,Patient,yeah. Will.
540.0,Provider,You had done it if you could have done if yeah.
9916.0,Patient,"I just feel like. I just caught myself like i'm my own person, maybe him and my sister my older sister do have a better relationship and that's fine if that's how it is i'll continue to be the black sheep, because my brother has been basically the same way, his whole life, you know. More of like this, you know sits in the shadow type of deal, you know. And i'm fine with that i'm okay with it. But I just need to make sure that I go to see him more often. Just for my own good, too, because you only get one dad you only get one mom and I don't know how much longer he's going to be here. that's how I look at it that's how I try to just need to tell myself every day just get over there and see him. what's the worst can happen is Kelly she's not there, but he's always there. I just don't like dealing with my step mom either she's. she's funny."
540.0,Provider,"I mean, sometimes, unfortunately, we also doing things not like out of obligation but knowing that like played the tape out so say something does happen to your dad you weren't able to get there. Even at your relationships, not the best thing at least you did that one thing of going there even being uncomfortable."
9916.0,Patient,I know. But.
540.0,Provider,It doesn't take away from that uncomfortable feeling.
9916.0,Patient,"A cash, just like so uncomfortable like like once I get there and I talked to him, you know we start chit chatting I feel a lot better you know, like. I think it's just my nerves like going there and getting this sucks because it's like when my dad first got sick, we were all going over there, a lot, you know we all were involved, but then it's like me and Nikki fell out and I got busy with the kids with the whole cogan thing and. I didn't want to you know get my dad sick or take a chance of getting my dad six so you know I kind of fell back from going over there, a lot. You know just build on top of all over again damn it. Oh, I."
540.0,Provider,Both.
9916.0,Patient,"Man, but I know it he's not gonna live forever so. I just need to suck it up to me."
