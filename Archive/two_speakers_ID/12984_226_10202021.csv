226.0,Provider,Oh no what's happening.
12984.0,Patient,"I went to my last appointment this morning and it took two hours normal and me and rain came back home they walk in and my whole house is flooded. Working on box or whatever, and I go to them, and he said, did you guys turn my power off. yeah we did the whole neighborhood the old subdivision and i'm like for how long and they're like oh to like five i'm like no way you guys didn't notify us. And all my fish are dying. Why did the House because there was no power, so there was no there was no way to put the water back up there was nothing like so all my flooded me house."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, my God, are you serious."
12984.0,Patient,"dying, so I like sitting in my car with my son when he fell three times We walked into my house and there's water every friggin were and they can even use the shop back to look at it like I don't know if you can see it but. Look at me fish are dying and there's nothing. Big teeth like I finally got it to stop the water to stop coming out, I was able to stop the water from flowing. That doesn't fix the problem that the whole House is already flooded. And it doesn't fix the problem that my fish are dying because they have no oxygen and that's thousands, I mean thousands and thousands of dollars of fish like thousands it's not like a few thousand it's like over $10,000. We have that we bought."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, my God is there any way they can turn your power back on."
12984.0,Patient,"them, I came out say I brought them in my house, I told them look at this mess look it friend stop it. I said, look at that, like my house is flooded they're like Oh well, we're just a contractor i'm sorry we don't we don't know and i'm like. Like can you turn the power backup gun and they're like they start out here called supervisor after supervisor and. Then they told me, yes, they said okay we'll work on getting it turned on it will take us like 30 minutes i'm like okay great then he comes back he's like i'm sorry my my boss's boss said. declined his his he asked my boss asked his boss, and he said no we're like we really wanted to help you and do this for you and reschedule it we were already working on rescheduling it and sending out emails or rescheduling. And then we got a call from the main boss, and they said no, they said that you should have received a notice and that they will provide you with documentation that you received a notice and if they'd failed on that part, then you can file a claim for damages. But that still doesn't stop rain, please, I said, but that still doesn't help meet my situation now like there's thousands of gallons of water in my house right now that I cannot get out. No rain stop I have no way of getting it out at this point like unless they take towels."
226.0,Provider,"And know you have you have to call do you have like what's it called. I can't think of the name, but like they come in and actually like clean. slate clean out that kind of stuff like clean out water like get like you know have pumps that will do that. I, I would ask one of those those workers if they're around like."
12984.0,Patient,"me they gave me a number to a claims person and they said call him and ask him if he can send someone to help you clean up the water. He said it might not be soon, but at least you'll get some help. So I have to still call him, but this literally I drove up at 1130 I was like oh perfect timing or get rain changed him his lunch and then you know have my appointment and we walk in. it's Okay, when we walk in and it's just dismiss and they're outside cutting a Bush to get to the frickin thing and I asked him how long has it been turned off and they said for 30 minutes. i'm like i've been in tears, for the last almost our know, since 1130 and marks at work he can't leave he can't he can't like. He works with a jail, who that are short staffed like they weren't. If he leaves it's a wall and he get in trouble for that so he can't he's like. he's like on the phone he's like i'm so sorry he's like all we've if you're going to leave, but you know what happens if I leave like I could get into serious trouble and lose my job and i'm like well no don't leave like just stay like what can you do and. So he is at work all upset he's like feel so sorry for me, because he can't be here and i'm like there's nothing I can't even really do anything I have a two year old that i'm watching like how am I supposed to do anything."
226.0,Provider,"My God i'm savannah let's Okay, so I think if there's any way that you can. Like make that call where you've got it you got to file that claim, but what I would also do start calling around for people to come out and try and get this water out of your place okay and it's like do you have like a rotor rooter it's not like a rotor rooter it's like. They have these industrial cleaners that will. You know what i'm talking about."
12984.0,Patient,"Like something up because I don't I don't think we have like me know that I know of like. The guy said, the only thing we know people doing that get damaged like this is filing a claim well like emergency service for them to come to me like we'll probably have to pay out of pocket which we don't have you know so. Like it just. it's just crazy I don't know i'm gonna call that guy and see if maybe he could send somebody out."

But that means. That, I have to clean up all the water first then drain all the rest of their water put new water in all well rains pooped hasn't eat lunch like i'm just frustrated I just don't even want to deal with this right now."
