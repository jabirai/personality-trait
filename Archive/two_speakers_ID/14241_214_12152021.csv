I made a payment I doing everything i'm supposed to do so it's better than last time, so, but at least i'm clear till July and i'm trying i'm just gonna do my best."
214.0,Provider,"I think if you continue with that outlook and not get too. Heavy about it. it'll be fine. Right, but if you worry your body you're going to miss something and blah blah blah okay."
14241.0,Patient,"And I have been boring but i'm just trying not to your right, but it's the holidays, and I know it's. Not like yeah i'm not I haven't done drugs I haven't done anything illegal it's just it's always like i'm distress in my mind, you know stresses going on but i'm handling i'm handling it, though."

I would say you call the virtual clinic and say listen I need to fully you my last because I was just on one manny. And they're not in there and i'm looking to get on there by tomorrow."
14241.0,Patient,"Okay, but also when I was at last thursday's group when you weren't there um Dr herself she she said that she she saw I went to the clinic and she said, thank you or she said she saw. I went to the lab she thanked me that I comply but um but yes, I will definitely do that, though, if you're not seeing it, but I know. Okay, no problem i'll do that regardless."
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so. swing for this, the blue dots. just want to take a look at these last surveys."
14241.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I. mean i'm honest with all when it says, you know, am I worrying more than one like you know that kind of stuff but."
214.0,Provider,They still worry yeah I think I think you need to ask answer that honestly.
14241.0,Patient,Well yeah. You know yeah.
214.0,Provider,"what's going on with a hiccup in the system, I think. Any documents. Alright, so that's going to be a bust, but where do you think your depression is because of the situation."
14241.0,Patient,"i'm depression oh i'm like on the scale one to 10 being the highest it's just like a two so it's not bad it's just I still worry, though, because. I always know the back of my mind I can come get me at any point, because I dealing with this for a couple years now and it's socks, but um I don't have I don't really have like. depression, otherwise I mean it's not necessarily depression it's more like a like a fear you know. go to jail, with my fear, just like It disrupts everything I mean it. it's embarrassing it's humiliating it's degrading it's shameful it's you know, although so yeah I do deal with that lot like heavily but. I mean, I can manage it well."
214.0,Provider,"And, and when we manage it is it creating any cravings and urges or just like who gives a shit or no."
14241.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I definitely give a shit but um no, it does not, it does not develop any kind of cravings or once but it does um I have trouble sleeping so i've been taking over the counter better draw alot so I know that's not you know that's frowned upon by i'm being honest about that yeah."
214.0,Provider,"I think, by mid July is safe. Okay, please do not having any underlining issues but. I know is sleeping."
14241.0,Patient,"Yes, i've always had trouble sleeping and I used to take ambien and other narcotics, which I refused to take now and I haven't taken them now, but um but yeah i've always had trouble sleeping but benadryl seems to be working so as long as that's okay i've been taking that."
214.0,Provider,And hasn't provided you with the support you need to get more sleep.
14241.0,Patient,"i'm absolutely yes, it does it helps me fall asleep I have trouble falling asleep it's not staying asleep it's the falling asleep part that sucks and i'm i've been i've been falling asleep so that yeah it does help. So hope it's okay."
214.0,Provider,"No, it is, I mean listen, I know I mean it, although it's an over the counter. medication, you know, we need to be careful that it doesn't. We don't have any adverse reactions to it we're not abusing it thinking, we need to take more to get more. right because benadryl benadryl is a sedation it's. Great Okay, so it looks like you're on suboxone eight milligrams I can't figure out how long of a script she gave you that you give you four day would have refill what is she wind up doing."
14241.0,Patient,"was a rebel yeah so i'll be do for refill tomorrow. No, I last week I got four more than i'll need you know, a refill tomorrow."
214.0,Provider,"So try it again, but I don't think the system is working, maybe we got lucky."
14241.0,Patient,"What can you like I don't want to screw it up, can you repeat one more time what you need me to do after this call, who now or the compliance and he."
214.0,Provider,"i'd like you to call the compliance. Listen, I just got on with many he went to review my labs. huh but the results are not in there."
14241.0,Patient,"Where should I go ahead, if you want to email on my results, I mean there's I."
214.0,Provider,"Would I would I would i'd like you to do is say listen, I can email them to now, can you get them in. If they say no don't worry about it don't know that. My concern is. When we go to look at them and we say hey you say you didn't but we don't have them it's already taken care of because you told somebody. I can't give them to you, you don't want them and bill no bad then us all I wanted to do is keep you in the clear I can't help if they don't want them, but I know when Dr so looks in there she's going to look for them results they're not in there."
14241.0,Patient,"Right and but like I like I said, the last Thursday, she didn't mention they were in there, and she did thank me for going Maybe she just went on my word I don't know but."
214.0,Provider,"But yeah she went on your word. She went on the word because one it doesn't look like it's filled. And that's okay. But I know every time we go to group, especially when I work with other doctors would like you said you want, we don't see him."
14241.0,Patient,we're trying to get ahead of that curve me and you yeah it's important yeah but yeah definitely outline but yeah i'll definitely um.
214.0,Provider,"Right now, just to give you an idea. So this is your depression score, the last one, you did. It comes up with a five it's mild. So, considering what you're going through this is a good number, it could it could be 20 right."
14241.0,Patient,Oh OK OK.
214.0,Provider,"and your anxiety is seven it's a little high, but I think this is situational I think yeah you know you feel like when's the other shoe gonna drop type of thing."
14241.0,Patient,"Yes, and I think I hate to cut you off, I know I told you this like, if you remember, like my first meeting I am i'm diagnosed ADHD which I took adderall again for years and years i'm not on the anymore, but that also you know it in flux or reflects my anxiety so i'm always."
214.0,Provider,Remember that. Seven isn't an indicator for anxiety. Okay 1725.
14241.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"that's my point you're. You know, sometimes we say I feel this way, and then we take this assessment and the assessment. says you're feeling it but you're not indicating it so. it's actually the mindset and and it doesn't mean you have a bad mindset it just means you may be more, and I think i'm really anxious but you're really not but you feel it."
14241.0,Patient,Correct yeah I like that yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Like when people say I think i'm coming down with something. Well, you either have something or you."
14241.0,Patient,don't like but.
214.0,Provider,We start to believe it in there. Then it takes off okay so has the medication been last thing all 24 hours.
14241.0,Patient,"It has um i've been i'm like right now I haven't even taken it, yet I got up at nine drink my object my coffee, you know. I try to take it as a way, as long as possible to take it, because I was having trouble if I wake up at six or seven I would take it at six or seven in the morning and. I would not be feeling well again by like five in the afternoon, so I take it as late as possible, like today i'll tell you when I get off the phone with you but um but yeah it's been laughing all day that that way."
214.0,Provider,"Right, so a good reflection is some people get up super early. They take it right away. And then, by three four o'clock they're like holy crap I feel terrible."
14241.0,Patient,yep.
214.0,Provider,"And they got to take it again, the problem is, then, by the time they go to sleep they go into withdrawals again so sometimes you have to play with the clock, so I always tell people 910 o'clock your next dose should be like seven eight o'clock."
14241.0,Patient,And then.
214.0,Provider,"It goes around and that's the whole idea to utilize the 24 hours. Say with the medications and sometimes people take instead of taking eight don't take a 4444. They just play with it, so they don't feel like terrible."
14241.0,Patient,"person right well right now i'm taking the one eight is late, like around 10 or 11 seems to be working So yes, so that's good Thank you."
214.0,Provider,"yeah okay great great I know we talked about this last time, what about employment how's that been going."
14241.0,Patient,"Well i've been out for about two weeks now i'm being the holidays and stuff okay that's a bad picture I have but um. I haven't looked into sign up and we're active I redid my resume I think I told you that I put it out there, I applied at this candle shop right by me, which is walking distance I can't die right now my license suspended until February okay so um. I have an interview not till after holiday so agile after its third, I believe, to interview so yeah something i'm happy."
214.0,Provider,And that's what I want to be reflective it's not thinking. you're not getting a job you're still trying to get a job just remember you're trying.
14241.0,Patient,"Right yes and i'm a quote we all need money i'm not saying that I have paper towels before but. At least i'm in a place where I don't know I don't need money you know, I have a good life I have a good boyfriend stuff who takes care of me and helps me out but um. But mostly I want to work to get out of the House, you know I need to work to have like my own self confidence or you know. But yeah I need to work."
214.0,Provider,But the self confidence should be to that i'm trying.
14241.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,I could not be trying and then I would understand why you have nothing going on. But as long as we keep trying. We can say hey listen may not get this one may not get that one I gotta keep doing something right and. yeah and that should build up some. Self esteem as well.
14241.0,Patient,"Right, yes, I agree alright."
214.0,Provider,"So let's go back to this chart alright so. Alright, so to get back on track is going to be difficult for now, but as long as you're attending and we set up your next appointment, does it any day really work for you."
14241.0,Patient,"Any day yes. I prefer like less time or later, but um but yeah anything or time is fine, though. I want to play so yeah I don't think going on."
214.0,Provider,What are your thoughts about new year's Eve.
14241.0,Patient,Okay yeah I don't think I mean I don't do we don't do anything um what time we looking at.

14241.0,Patient,But it feels good to take them when you know you're gonna pass.
214.0,Provider,"For certain into it, listen it's a good thing to have accountability, you may feel uncomfortable but the reality is. When when people are utilizing them and they don't have to worry about it doesn't become a big thing it becomes a big thing when people are still floundering saying no I got it to me the weekend and then you're right I get that so. I respect that you're Okay, and you would do it all the time that's a great thing because your commitment in your sobriety."
14241.0,Patient,"And that's. What we're doing i'm not a drinker because she just like Dr so I was talking a lot about drinking your own the holidays, and you know, trying to do it as oh. I don't have to worry about that and i've been like a social or you know once in a while drinker I just don't like to do it so yeah I got a pretty good handle on it.
