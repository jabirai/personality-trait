11363.0,Patient,"um you know I still like to try and gaslight myself over my my state constantly but i'm grateful to have experience now differentiating between like. horrible fatigue and terrible pain and depression, so I don't actually think i'm depressed but i'm always paranoid that it's like encroaching all the time. So it's you know i'm hanging in there, but i'm dealing with a lot of shit all the time and working with my therapist with ptsd shit and so that's really uncomfortable because dealing with it means it's like on the surface, all the time. So."
298.0,Provider,"So true always on the surface, he on, if I remember correctly, did you put off going to master school or doctorate school or."
11363.0,Patient,"Is it just yeah yeah yeah good memory, I decided to cut off applying. This application cycle. I can barely be on a computer for more than 45 minutes at a time and if I do it more than like a few hours a day like I suffer for like the next 24 hours i'm like it's. not tenable. Which is so humbling and frustrating. But um yeah that's just like where i'm at. So. Like the health is gradually improving, but it's like it's like by improving I mean like i'm healthy enough to be bored now but not healthy enough to like. pee on my computer to distract myself so listening to lots of audiobooks well resting and stretching and trying to take care of myself. And I got another group appointment or group therapy assignment. um so I appreciate everyone being accommodating about that and. Still meeting monthly was Sean i'm. yeah that's kinda kind of what's going on."

298.0,Provider,"Like yeah I have a boss, who is an avid reader. And I. meet with him on. Friday mornings, and I pick his brain so."
11363.0,Patient,"Do it cuz I had a really discouraging meeting with the the pain management specialist i've been trying to see for like months and they're like. yeah like just keep you know, cognitive behavioral therapy and and Oh, do you have current there's a question, do you have like cognitive behavioral therapist on staff because. I don't want to stop seeing my wonderful therapist who i've been seeing for six months, which is the longest relationship with a therapist i've had in like 15 years. But both the pain management specialist and the acupuncturist are recommending specifically cognitive behavioral therapy to treat the physical symptoms. You know samantha size blah blah blah because of the pto he and i'm like. I have spent hours on the phone being transferred amongst various insurance company entities being like how do I work this system to get you to pay. For this very specific form of therapy, in addition to my regular therapist to treat this physical pain and it just it doesn't exist in this reality, so if anyone knows of any creative hoop jumping to get me to see a cognitive behavioral therapist to treat my physical pain. You know, because i've made a number of impact quote unquote impossible health insurance things happen this year, so now, I think I can do."
298.0,Provider,"I don't have the answer for you, but maybe I will get it."
11363.0,Patient,"I just I don't you know. I very little hope but i'm just. throwing it out there, you know i'm talking to like insurance coordinators and other offices that I can you ever heard of this biggest thing. Because I think it should be a thing, because I can't possibly be the only person that's ever had this. You know. particular issue. And I think I deserve this treatment to treat my thing. that's my yeah that's it basically."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I will catch you later."
11363.0,Patient,"All right, thank you so much chantelle. Another a follow up in a month. And yeah that'll be that."
