79.0,Provider,Okay yeah let's let's kind of talk about that for sure.
14689.0,Patient,"yeah well cuz I didn't talk to my dad about it, the last time. So i'm kind of like. I feel like in gaining weight not like a time but i'm trying to like call my phone down and not feel like. And it's easier in the winter. I think, because i'm not super hyper focused on like I don't know."
79.0,Provider,Just yeah.
14689.0,Patient,"You know, with the big coach and everything. I mean i've been. Good my body is starting to regulate not having like crazy side effects anymore, I mean here and there, but i've been like incomes and trying to like. limit the coffee and hydrate more and. Try to keep it regulated um. So yeah."
79.0,Provider,"Anyway, yeah yeah so well, I always want to ask you know, a couple questions before i'm like Okay, this is kind of what your weights doing but um what what are you most afraid of what is the like fear threat going on."
14689.0,Patient,"um well I talked it Andrea about it yesterday, and I think. I have been really lucky with like my dietitians and that like trusting men and. I don't know I just had like really good experience with like you and amanda and that you guys have really tried to hone it in me and my mom's registered dietitian that like. You guys aren't trying to make me. gain like hundreds and hundreds of pounds. or anything like that or even like my heavy is just to make sure everything that I do it, and so I feel like i'm very well accepting that but I guess that's my really that's my biggest fear is. Getting back to like my heavy is a thing."
79.0,Provider,That you don't want to go to where to where you were at your heaviest.
14689.0,Patient,yeah okay.
79.0,Provider,And what what would cause you to go to your heaviest.
14689.0,Patient,"Just like I think just getting out of control. and Just. I mean. It was really unhealthy and how I. didn't really I mean really during that time or did I wasn't taking care of myself or anything like that it was coping with food, like the transitional part of my life. And so I guess just getting to that point of like. really like Beijing."
79.0,Provider,So you're you're kind of scared then because i'm going to draw the i'm going to put the point to the point. I can't escape it.
14689.0,Patient,"That i'm gonna go on. To because I I did really kind of. The eating disorder started out with more purging and then kind of switched over to like restriction, so I guess i'm kind of scared of it, turning into like."
79.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah, and so I mean what that is is you're afraid you're going to stop taking care of yourself, not necessarily lose control right."
14689.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
79.0,Provider,And what would motivate you to stop taking care of yourself and to stop paying attention to. You know what feels good for you what doesn't feel good for you.
14689.0,Patient,I think I don't know I am. Maybe just having like a falling out with myself I don't know just kind of giving up.
79.0,Provider,"And that's what would cause that to happen again, if you did."
14689.0,Patient,"Maybe. kind of thought, maybe this like falling into like a depressive state navy."
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm. How likely, do you think that has to happen."
14689.0,Patient,"No, I don't get that likely. At least I know, but who knows. i'm predicting."
79.0,Provider,"But, but at the same time, like you say you're unpredictable and, yes, I would say you have I mean you have a darling personality right that has you know some spontaneity anyway it's it's lovely but your people like your people that you spend time with what are they like to you."
14689.0,Patient,"Well, and I guess that's The thing is i'm in a different place with my relationship with them like my almost really like the time the darkest time in my life, where happened, and when. I get it have a support system or I was like rebelling against my support system, and now I have a much better like positive relationship with them and more positive people in my life that I didn't have. yeah."
79.0,Provider,"yeah so you've answered yourself I don't know if you you if you don't hear it like I hear it, but i'm like oh my gosh like you have nothing to be afraid of."
14689.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"Like you want to take care of yourself, you have people in your life, who teach you and encourage you to take care of yourself, so why would you do that, next that would be weird. Or you know it'd be like whoa."
14689.0,Patient,They are.
79.0,Provider,The universe just flipped or something.
14689.0,Patient,"yeah I think yeah I don't know I guess I I don't think i'm like necessarily worried that that's going to happen, I think i'm just. Of. The possibility of it happening because I have experienced that and I know that feeling and it's a scary thing to think of though I think it's more like. I don't know worst case scenario, maybe."
79.0,Provider,"yeah which I mean it's true it's there's still a possibility of course um, but it would really take you rejecting."
14689.0,Patient,yeah people in your life.
79.0,Provider,And I just at least I can't see that happening. I think you you're too you've grown to wise. You know you just when you have grown that wise you don't you're like stupid.
14689.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,They do that.
14689.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"So. yeah but anyway, as far as your weight goes so it's so what happened, basically, with your weight, where you came into the Program. and your your weight just you know you start here and your way kind of did a little bit of this and then it went and and now you're back to where when you first came into program you're almost exactly the same. You know I don't know how that sits with you."
14689.0,Patient,know that makes me feel better.
79.0,Provider,And it's not it's not a. we're talking little.
14689.0,Patient,"Amounts yeah. yeah so no, but I think i'm moving in the right direction. mm hmm yeah."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and my perspective of your recovery, you know is very much not on the weight focus, but it is a piece and body image is a piece here, you want to. You know heal that relationship really be able to walk walk the talk right like be able to just be really like you know what whenever my body is going to be when I am honoring hunger and fullness that's what it is and who am I to fight that like I was born That way, you know. But do do tell me a little bit like the. The hyper focusing can cause kind of some irrational thoughts right, I do want to hear some of those like what what is, what does it sound like in your head when you're like. I think i've gained like 10 pounds, which of course you haven't."
14689.0,Patient,um. I mean that really that's just this like. I don't know i'm just. Like i'm never like if I start gaining my not gonna stop or like. Just kind of like nitpicking like on my Facebook so bloated today.
79.0,Provider,Okay yeah the hyper focus. On the face yeah.
14689.0,Patient,"yeah and, like other parts, like my stomach is it was a pretty big one, and I didn't really insecure about um. yeah just. kind of thinking about reflecting on it and then trying to like push it away. Trying to cope with it with. Most the time at work, sometimes you know it does get yeah."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and do you know what situations it's worse like where you can't even though you, you know you're having that thought and a time before you've been able to say wait that's irrational that's not true. I reject that."
14689.0,Patient,yeah probably when i'm not using my support when i'm kind of isolating. Well i'm. I know a lot better but kind of in almost in those times when like my parents aren't home they're like out doing something. And if I just don't feel like talking to anybody i'm kind of in like a down mood.
79.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's really, really there's so much wisdom there. yeah and one thing that I would love this isn't really for nutrition, but if you feel like it, you know talk to Andrea about that you know what is it, why do sometimes I go and block myself off. Why do I why don't have that little stubbornness and what what's that about. For me. To understand yourself a little bit better."
14689.0,Patient,We talked about that. And i'm just as. lost for why. figure it out.
79.0,Provider,"Well, I mean you definitely have a strong like you have a strong drive like it's easy to sense that, and you probably have some some real little and maybe there's part of you, that is. You know nervous that somebody's going to try and shut you down not let you be polite you know."
14689.0,Patient,What.
79.0,Provider,I don't know who knows. But sounds like you're on it with him so that's good i'm. Just gonna look at your nutrition assignments I can't remember it is it the self compassion one so right.
14689.0,Patient,yeah she wanted me.
79.0,Provider,To.
14689.0,Patient,Do the same one from last week.
79.0,Provider,Okay yeah what are your thoughts about that.
14689.0,Patient,"Myself more self compassion. And I thought about it and I just. don't know how. I feel for, which is why she told me that I could do it again and. I need to learn how and i'm just like I think I might be but."
79.0,Provider,I. don't like the jedi training in the Star Wars. Young pat one.
14689.0,Patient,As.
79.0,Provider,"Well yeah. yeah, what do you think is self compassion."
14689.0,Patient,"Oh, when I talked to her about it. I. I think so. Okay, so the original email was that. Okay, well, it was like that, like. turning the words around like instead of I can't do this I can't do this yet."
79.0,Provider,or something like sorry yeah.
14689.0,Patient,"And I talked about an anomaly it's cheesy it's like. I don't know. If this doesn't seem like genuine or natural. And so, she said try thinking about how you would. Speak to a friend or family member who is struggling with or eating. And I think that's a little bit easier for me to do. Like a little bit more natural than like I can do this yet. seems so like. i'm weird to me but. yeah I mean, I think that the. The thing is, is like I would never. Like I definitely thought back to like how I would react, because when my sister was struggling with her eating disorder I didn't really understand it like it, and then. I still free to, and so I didn't really like see like oh. But like if. If she is I was like how I am now, and she was like struggling with that now. I I kind of thought about it like that, like what I would say or credits."
79.0,Provider,Perfect yeah.
14689.0,Patient,You now that i'm you know. wiser monitor.
79.0,Provider,Right.
14689.0,Patient,"So I mean that helps, especially since my sister, not just a good friend, or something, but like. So I guess I. I i'm more of like a realist that's why I think I find it a little bit more. cheesy and it's hard, but I think. In my I think my mom kind of similar so I just try to like think about the things that she says to me. Like. you're not the you'd like separating yourself from the eating disorder. My. You know not characterizing your. Like attributes and trace and stuff with. That but like what you've done without it's."
79.0,Provider,kind of saying and.
14689.0,Patient,"i'm just kind of trying to I think my thing, especially lately have been like trying to keep my momentum going because i'm afraid i'm going to like. Have a dip or something in it again. Within said well. But. Right me about oh I don't know."
79.0,Provider,"If she was if she had said some of the things you said, like you know I I look in the mirror and i'm I feel like my faces puffy or you know what would you say if she was going oh my gosh my face like I know i've been bait look at my face."
14689.0,Patient,"I would like slacker me like this stupid. You know, like I I think I wanted to be more like lighthearted."
79.0,Provider,That yeah.
14689.0,Patient,"I love that I struggle with like my emotions. And being emotional I just don't want to take anything like too seriously. And just. Even if it even if you have like who cares right doesn't matter it. doesn't mean you're a bad person it. doesn't change the way people think about you, and if it does, then you're not worth it."
79.0,Provider,"yeah so is that self compassion, if you turned it to you."
14689.0,Patient,I think.
79.0,Provider,It totally is yeah I agree like just to go like if you're analyzing go just stop it.
14689.0,Patient,It doesn't matter.
79.0,Provider,"Do something else you know it, because a non self compassionate thought would be. Oh, my gosh I can't believe you're doing that again like you were never going to get better, you know that would be like the shaming like never or just you know being drawn and suck yourself deeper into yeah like it is it's happening like you know and just kind of that negative and. vicki."
14689.0,Patient,"I mean I, personally, I mean we're like toughest critics and so obviously like. All the negative things that I say to myself, I would never say like my test or anything. like that, but it's like Why am I so hard on myself when I wouldn't even think about saying that to somebody else. You know."
79.0,Provider,"yeah it's true. boy yeah and one thing to, I think, to me, made a difference and I don't know if that'll make a difference for you, but I learned that the more you stay self critical. The more that's going to overflow like if you learn in a sense it they're gonna feel it and they're going to feel criticism from you, even though you would think I would never do that to somebody else. Well they're still going to the longer you become you are that type where you're just self critical. it's going to naturally overflow. So, to me it was more motivating to be like Okay, I want to cut it out, then I do not want to have my kids do like they're criticized all the time or."
14689.0,Patient,most interesting. It kind of makes you think about the people in your life.
79.0,Provider,"yeah it's true. yeah. Okay, that sounds good if you just want to even share that you know i'm just I it may not sound like what are you guys maybe do it, but I am going to be on my self compassionate voice is like a snap out of it doesn't matter and that's still self compassion, it is even. Like oh my gosh no you're beautiful."
14689.0,Patient,"I love, I say."
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. mm hmm good, and do you need any help like how's it going with your your dad in the meals who's doing what like describe it."
14689.0,Patient,"it's going good it's kind of been more like 5050 with him, making my meals and we making them for myself, but still like overseas from a distance tell me a little bit more freedom here and there. So it's uh yeah I mean it's been going really well getting pretty much the same thing. As last time they've been making like my mom. puts all these like recipes girl enjoyed making for dinner, and like saving for like the leftovers, and everything will have that the. kind of like meal prepping my goodness."
79.0,Provider,yeah cool.
14689.0,Patient,What helps you know just not think too hard about it. yeah.
79.0,Provider,Thanks anything. yeah anything with your boyfriend like is he playing a role in this at all.
14689.0,Patient,"seen him that much I see him normally like i'll go and spend the night in once you like, once or twice a day, but I mean he's been. Well, again i'm. Just the same old simply support and trying to like. He does a lot of the tough love to like. might even think about it. snap out of it."
79.0,Provider,The rational. as great as.
14689.0,Patient,"He does it I think he's just like is annoyed by it right now, which is good, I think, wasting our time, together with you know the boys and everything so. yeah he's been great."
79.0,Provider,yeah and and there will be a time where you're going to look back and go did I really think that way.
14689.0,Patient,"I mean, I still yeah I mean, I still do like. Okay, good and he said, but. i'm like this person that I like trust and love, is telling you this so it kind of put it in perspective it."
