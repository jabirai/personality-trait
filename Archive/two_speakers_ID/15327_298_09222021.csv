But you do need to go to group therapy group therapy is once a week for the first month after one month, you can go down to twice. A week if you've kept your appointments and you make that request what group therapy is is one hour on zoom that I am there at the there a therapist is there and. And then there are other people there, the therapist will bring a conversation topic like boundaries shame, whatever it is that they wanted to talk about. And then I come on and I meet with people to see if you need refills that's how our program works anytime you want to make a one on one appointment with me, you can do that, in addition to the group therapy, you only need to see our therapist once every three months. And because you already have an outside therapist if you didn't, then you would see our therapist a lot more often."
