12241.0,Patient,i'm well how are you.
416.0,Provider,i'm doing okay. Coming toward the end of my day. Right yeah. So how have things been since the last time we talked.
12241.0,Patient,"um things have been good, I actually. i'm sorry oh yeah. i've had to take notes um. I actually got an email. This morning, from my advisor. That they're gonna let me do the withdrawal from the class. quaintness yeah um so that's good um and then I start school tomorrow morning."
416.0,Provider,Oh wow I came up fast.
12241.0,Patient,and fast.
416.0,Provider,"and fast. wow really fast so um how are you are you feeling ready, are you organized, because I know that was a big goal of yours, was to kind of start to get everything."
12241.0,Patient,um I do feel like i've got no lot done in the last couple of weeks um as far as like just getting life organize um I i'm just feeling like a little stress so for work. We got accepted to sell at the I don't know if you know outside lands in San Francisco.
416.0,Provider,well.
12241.0,Patient,Are you are you going.
416.0,Provider,"No i'm not I i'm not going to big concerts but i've been many, many times yeah."
12241.0,Patient,"Okay i've never actually been to music festivals because. With like the sensory thing I was always really afraid that it would overwhelm me and then I think I told you that we went to Chicago. For the music festival, and I did okay there so. We found out like two weeks ago that we got accepted to sell there. And so, like the deal my boss, and I kind of have is that she pays the she pays for everything, and I just don't get a salary, when I go, so I get to sell like my own designs that I make. At our booth and then she doesn't pay me like my wages that I typically make."
416.0,Provider,Do you usually pretty well.
12241.0,Patient,"I did really well in Chicago which was so Chicago was, I want to say 15,000 people and outside lands is 200,000, so I would say."
416.0,Provider,"I finances 200,000 wow."
12241.0,Patient,"um yeah, so I am looking forward to that and also Tony ended up buying a ticket to the festival so she's going to come with me, which is. cool yeah. And so we're doing i'm doing that and then. So that's it for Halloween and then we have another festival, the second week of November and then. And then for thanksgiving i'm going to New York. I originally just wanted to like leave la for thanksgiving because I don't really have any family or friends here and tony's gonna have her kids that whole week. And so I didn't really want to be like sitting around the city by myself. Just because, like with my mom like ever since she passed away I don't the holidays are a little weird so I booked the trip and then. I actually turned it into a work trip, so we have a boutique in brooklyn that sells our lingerie so actually my boss, is going to come with me for two days and we're going to do a pop up there for small business Saturday."
416.0,Provider,cool.
12241.0,Patient,"yeah and then I like took some meetings for work as well, so I actually just ended up being able to like also get paid well in there, which is nice."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
12241.0,Patient,"And then, like 10 days after that is my birthday and then tony's best friend's birthday, is the same week as mine, and he had booked a trip to Vegas so they like invited us so we're going, and so I just feel a lot. And then we. Will and i'm going to have to be like extremely rigid. With my schedule, I also I did have orientation yesterday. and I didn't realize this, but my program there are only 12 of us that got accepted to the program and. They only do those classes and each specific quarter, so our core classes are only because they only start the program once every two years, so."
416.0,Provider,We say yours is going to get extended since you've had to withdraw.
12241.0,Patient,"know so I only took the the like the the program doesn't actually start until now, I was taking gen ED classes early. thinking that finish early I didn't realize that you have to do your core classes in order in those specific quarters. So, like she was saying, she was like don't feel pressured to take five classes, you can build up your gen ED classes and extend your program by a quarter and just do all of your dental classes in one quarter at the end. So. Okay um that actually take some pressure off. yeah my end up just dropping one of the gen ED classes, I took."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So, then, that would bring you down to how many classes this year or the Semester quarter sorry. For for. Okay that's better."
12241.0,Patient,yeah for is typical that's like full time.
416.0,Provider,yeah. But you're also working full time so it's a lot.
12241.0,Patient,"um so that just made me feel a little better about, not because I was thinking like Oh, I want to take as many classes, I can to graduate early and like I didn't realize that that's not how the program is structured. So that makes me feel better about. That. Having to pressure myself to take a million glasses."
416.0,Provider,"Good good okay so that's a tiny bit of pressure off and you built up all these trips, on top of it, but their trips that are during breaks right for the most part. I know."
12241.0,Patient,"Oh Halloween no so i'll be gone Thursday, Friday Saturday Sunday, so I will just have to. Either have all of my assignments finished before I leave or I will have to work long gone. And then for thanksgiving that will be break on break. And then my birthday trip will be during finals um but we're only going Saturday night so we're leaving here in the morning staying Saturday night and coming back Sunday afternoon so it's not. Really, a huge deal."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
12241.0,Patient,"So yeah, I think, as long as I stick to like i'm going to be like very strict with taking my Admiral at the same time, every day. I also wanted to ask and i'm not sure if you would know or if, like Maybe I should ask Mary but i'm wondering if Maybe I should cut my adderall and half and take half in the morning and half in the afternoon."
416.0,Provider,Definitely a married question.
12241.0,Patient,Okay cool.
416.0,Provider,"Nada Julie question I wish I could help you, but I know nothing about it."
12241.0,Patient,Okay cool um yeah I just think and i've i've been training myself to wake up at like six or 630. So yeah i'm just trying to be like really strict with my schedule.
416.0,Provider,yeah I mean we could even say structured with your schedule which for an ADHD brain is your brain will thrive with that structure. mm hmm and actually if you are diagnosed with autism or even you know even a very mild version again structure is one of the the critical components of treatment.
12241.0,Patient,"um yeah I did talk to Mary about that, and she said that I would have to contact my like health care provider or whatever."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah she mentioned it to me and I was like I don't know, are you qualified to do it, and she was like I don't think so so she's I think that your your general practitioner, whoever that is would be better qualified."
12241.0,Patient,"Honestly i've done a lot of research about getting a diagnosis, as an adult and there aren't very many people in the country who are technically qualified to diagnose adults."
416.0,Provider,Interesting I know that.
12241.0,Patient,"yeah, so I think I think like you still, can I just think there are people who are more qualified and there's not that many of them."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah there are like I wonder if anything if your school has like a behavioral health Center or something or if you get any coverage medical coverage, through your school that might be worth exploring to because they do have. They do have resources at schools, often for any kind of like neuro divergence."
12241.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"I don't I know that that's trillion true and like public universities, I don't know what the deal is with. Private."
12241.0,Patient,"Okay i've been a little nervous to like mention it to them, because I don't I didn't want to be like treated differently, I guess um. But now that i'm like in the program and have already gotten one degree there um, I guess, I feel slightly more comfortable. What about it. um so yeah maybe i'll do that when I go on campus tomorrow."
416.0,Provider,"yeah that might be good, I mean it's worth just knowing right."
12241.0,Patient,yeah. So yeah i'm a little. I guess nervous i'm tony's teaching eight classes this semester.
416.0,Provider,wow that's crazy pants.
12241.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,That is a lot. Is that normal for her.
12241.0,Patient,"She normally does more than she has to do, but this quarter or this semester, she took over two classes for someone in her department, who went on maternity leave. um."
416.0,Provider,"Hopefully they're not classes, she has to create like new curriculum for each time."
12241.0,Patient,"um but. yeah so i'm just feeling I feel like we're going into like a time that's going to kind of. be a test of like. Are we going to be okay doing this because, like, I feel like it's going to be a lot of especially. Her her ex wife is being. more difficult than normal."
416.0,Provider,And yeah you mentioned that that was starting to happen.
12241.0,Patient,yeah and it's gotten worse and so like meeting the kids is just like not an option at the moment and. I I guess it's like i'm just thinking it's probably going to be a little bit difficult to like see each other. because she lives in orange orange county and I live in downtown la and. I can't see her on the days that she has the kids. yeah so i'm a little not like nervous just I feel like it might be kind of difficult I guess.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is where the anxiety comes in right."
12241.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"it's like well. This is coming up, I don't know how it's going to be and then your brain will tend to kind of jump toward the. The scariest possible outcome. Right me if I may not happening yeah yeah. So this is where we've been talking about a lot about cognitive distortions like that's that's what that is that's a. it's it's somewhat natural because it's natural just sort of like want to emotionally prepare for the worst case scenario. But that's not really how it ends up working out right because we can't really be emotionally prepared for the worst case scenario, you know it just like that just doesn't work, and so what it does instead is caused us a bunch of grief in the moment. And stress in the moment in anticipation of something that may or may not ever happen or might work out totally differently yeah. yeah so Is there something that you might be able to kind of, say, to yourself or think about differently, that would have that that might help."
12241.0,Patient,"I think I just try and tell myself that like it's not first of all it's like not forever and she keeps saying to me she's like you know. These are because we've talked about at a certain point, like moving in together sometime next year um. And she's like you know you should enjoy like living in La and like having Saturday night free every now and again, and like doing these things that like you're going to move to orange county and Miss doing. So I try and think about that I also. I think for like the first time I feel like I live in a space that is my own that i've like created for myself and i'm trying to like enjoy. That as well. You know we've kind of talked about like. In life like we both would like to like save money and buy a house, and so our plan was kind of we will move in together into the apartment that she currently lives in to save money for like a year um. And so I guess I just i'm trying to tell myself to like enjoy the space, I have now because I won't ever have that same space ever again."
416.0,Provider,"yeah that's a great counter statement for the whole thing. yeah I love it, and so this is my time I am going to enjoy this time I might miss her but also like okay it's gonna be all right."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah and I definitely don't feel like. i'm like things aren't okay when we're not together, I just I think it's I think it's a lot of things, but it's a lot of frustration as well at the situation that there's like such strict boundaries because of something that neither one of us can control. And yeah really frustrating."
416.0,Provider,Really frustrating.
12241.0,Patient,yeah. it's also really frustrating to. Like the person that you love and care about is being spoken to in such a terrible way that makes them feel terrible.
416.0,Provider,uh huh.
12241.0,Patient,"And I have never had to like navigate that situation before I know that that is a common for a lot of date. You know, someone who has been divorced, and has children and things weren't pretty. But I just. You know that's like a difficult thing to watch the person that you care about be so upset over something someone saying things that are really ugly and terrible."
416.0,Provider,"It is really hard, how are you coping with that. Because it's hard not like it's one of those things that you have to observe, without having any controller influence over right."
12241.0,Patient,"And that's what like you know if she asks me because sometimes she'll say hey do you think this is an okay thing to say, or like she'll ask for my opinion about like do you think i'm being unreasonable or. Things like that, but mostly I just try and like remind her like you don't have to stoop to her level you don't have to say ugly things like you should think before you say things. and very much like. Helping not helping because we both try and say like we're not responsible for the other person's emotions. But, just like today saying you know, like maybe you should talk to your therapist about a coping mechanism to like bring you back to earth before you respond to those types of things. So that you don't say something equally as ugly as she does."
416.0,Provider,"Well, and maybe, making it a policy to. Making it a policy to not respond right away to have somebody else read it right like there's maybe you're not the person to read it, I don't know, but because it puts you in a weird position, but like she has her best friend who she trusts or something."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah well and that I think that's the other hard thing is that her best friend, is also the person who fathered their children. She tries, not to involve him because. She. was guilty that like he helped them have kids and now the situation has gone badly."
416.0,Provider,yeah that's tricky so maybe her therapist just the best person for therapist is willing to do that.
12241.0,Patient,"yeah um, but I think. I think I was actually thinking today it's so strange the feeling not not in like a bad way but of being with someone where there's like no problems there's like nothing going wrong there's nothing to like fight or argue about every day like we're just like."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, some people would thrive with that, and some people need a little like like a little more drama."
12241.0,Patient,"know what I am I very much enjoy that we can just live life, it just is. it's weird because sometimes like I miss Antonio but I don't miss him I don't miss our relationship. I certainly don't miss walking on eggshells 24 seven or being afraid that i'm saying or doing the wrong things constantly I also don't really even know that I liked him as a person, very much, and so I wonder like. If those sensations are like you know staying with his family during code like made me feel very like safe and secure wonder if, maybe that's more of like. Not that I don't feel that now, I think, maybe I just feel sad about losing that other thing."
416.0,Provider,"Well, given your background your history finding a place where you feel safe within the context of a family is a pretty unusual thing for you it's a pretty big deal right yeah. So. yeah and you've kind of said this, since the beginning, like it's that that was probably the hardest thing to give up, even though your relationship with Antonia wasn't very healthy and didn't feel very good to you. I mean, I think that thrill."
12241.0,Patient,"And Tony asked me today, she was like didn't like didn't his parents ever see him treating you that way, and like they never said anything and and i've thought about that actually a lot recently like. You know, like because, if it had been my family and like she said that like she was saying, if it had been her family, like her parents would have been like whoa this isn't cool like you can't treat her that way. But I mean."
416.0,Provider,"not today, not see it was one of those people who kind of did it mostly in the background or."
12241.0,Patient,"No, I mean. He there were times, where he was extremely mean to me in front of them. or where he liked through a fit or through tantrum. I guess maybe I got the feeling that, like it's just how he was and i'm."
416.0,Provider,guessing i'm wondering if. Does he do the same thing to them.
12241.0,Patient,"I mean, he never did that to them in front of me. But like also there was the language barrier of his mom not speaking very good English."
416.0,Provider,"Of what what language, do they speak."
12241.0,Patient,Well they're from Mexico.
416.0,Provider,You don't speak Spanish.
12241.0,Patient,"Not very well, and she didn't speak English super well his dad spoke English really well but, and you know they're like very well off and he still is, you know, on the family payroll basically. And Jeff oh I don't know but. I guess. I guess I think about those things, and I think like when you break up with someone you tend to see things so much better than they actually were. that's probably just what it is, is not. not seeing things the way that they actually were."
416.0,Provider,"And you're I mean you're missing the big picture right the context the family, because now you're connected to to Tony who is wonderful like individually, but she comes with a challenging situation. And that's yeah and Antonio was like kind of the opposite right he was challenging but. But you were really felt really close to his family."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I think like her family is really great like we face time with them and stuff like her mom and her brothers and. Like we do like family game nights and stuff with them, sometimes, but so like her daughter is in girl scouts and. At at the store that like we have a store friend at work and we sell like hair clips and stuff, and so we had all these hair clips that we're going to get thrown out, and so I like portion to them off for her to give to like her girl scout troop. I like had gotten her son some sunglasses from the store just to like so he didn't feel left out, and then, when they took them home on Saturday. Tony got like these ugly messages that were definitely stemmed from the fact that, like I had given the kids things. And so. that's it's also like how to. How to navigate that because. I don't want to be the reason that they feel are also there was as so I have pet rats to pet rats and. They are very attached to me so when I stay here I bring them with me and like we bought like a cage and stuff here for them. And so, apparently her ex had come in the apartment which she doesn't do that often to pick them up and saw the cage and asked oh like are you getting pets and Tony was like no. And she said her ex kept pressing her about it and the little girl finally was like mom it's just for fun and like lied about it. because she knows what the cages cages for and so that makes me sad because it's like she already is like emotionally managing her mom and I don't want to be the reason that she has to do that ever. But I all grow up."
416.0,Provider,know that you can control that.
12241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I mean. If it weren't you if it isn't you it's going to be somebody else with Tony eventually who. is in an awkward position but you're not the one creating this situation you're in the you're in the position to respond to it right and even even with that you're you only. have room for kind of a limited response to this situation there isn't a whole lot you can control or do about it so it's not like you are putting them in any kind of position their mom is putting them in this position. And if they if you break up with, I mean at some point, if you end up leaving Tony if that doesn't work out then Tony will eventually find somebody else and they'll still be in the same position, whether whether or not it's you I guess that's what i'm saying. And that is entirely on their mom who's putting them in that position, it is not on, you guys because you're simply not right, giving children a gift of some breaths for their girl scout troop or like that's. yeah yeah. You know what I mean like there's nothing. That should not results in a in a dramatic situation."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah it's very frustrating, I guess, I also spoke like a child when dealing with these situations, I don't know why I feel like. i'm not equipped to like make this decision, but i'm 32 like i'm not a child, but sometimes I feel like when i'm making these decisions I forget that i'm 32 and not 22."
416.0,Provider,"Well, and tony's a bit older than you right."
12241.0,Patient,yeah she's 44.
416.0,Provider,"Right so. I mean. yeah, and this is your first time in a relationship that feels like or that where you are involved with kids right and kind of have to balance all of that, so this is, I mean it can be, you can feel really young when. When when you. When you're trying to its new right, and this is uncharted territory for you."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah um. But. I mean, I guess, this is kind of like a big subject change, but I am. I have also been like not in contact with my own mother."
416.0,Provider,We were talking about that last time I was wondering about because you had mentioned one of your goals is to actually have a bigger discussion with her.
12241.0,Patient,"yeah and honestly i've just been avoiding it because I just don't expect her to respond well, and so I just haven't spoken to her at all and I guess she's written off the fact that, like I don't want to talk to her. And in my opinion it's like if you. Are her age, I guess, maybe she's almost 60 and your adult child doesn't want to talk to you, maybe your first response shouldn't be what's their problem, it should probably be what have I done something to warrant this. And I don't like she has those like inner reflections at all."
416.0,Provider,"Well, she doesn't have a whole lot of experience actually being a mom to you know."
12241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So I don't think she's gonna respond and kind of those ways isn't there, there are all of those responses are related to the original reasons that she didn't raise you. Right she's never had the healthiest ways of walking through the world."
12241.0,Patient,I guess that's also. Something i've been thinking about is like do I want to bring up that subject like.
416.0,Provider,"What do I, which subject."
12241.0,Patient,"Of like her, because I think i've told you, she didn't tell me who my dad was until I was 18 uh huh. And not only that, but she lied about."
416.0,Provider,"I didn't know that she lied about that, but I knew that she didn't tell you who your dad actually was until he was a turn tell you right."
12241.0,Patient,yeah so I grew up thinking someone else was my dad. um so I grew up actually being a part of that person's family like spending summers with him and his wife and his kids and.
416.0,Provider,And did he think that you are his biological child too.
12241.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,i'm your mom knew the whole time that you were not.
12241.0,Patient,"So when she told everyone this. Actually, he so the guy that I thought was my dad he went to prison. I think I was like 13 maybe he was in the marines and he got drafted to go to Afghanistan and he was out celebrating with friends and had a couple beers and drove gone to a car accident and a person he hit died. And so, he went to prison for."
416.0,Provider,I want to say slaughter.
12241.0,Patient,"I nears yeah. Oh wow and his wife, who he's been with since I was two she had actually just gotten pregnant. With their first kid together. So I think lily was like six months or a year when he went to prison. And she stayed with him Sarah did. And they now have like another child. and When I found out, I had to drive to Texas, where he was in prison and go there and tell him."
416.0,Provider,i'm really sorry you've had to go through all of us.
12241.0,Patient,yeah so I just don't know if that's like something I want like I just I know that you shouldn't like. I. predict people's responses to things but also I just feel like I know her well enough to know that she will never take responsibility for those things. yeah so I don't know if it's like a situation where I just continue to have relationship with her. And like make peace with those things for myself or. If those things. will be the reason that I don't ever have a relationship with her.
416.0,Provider,"So I think that. I think that she's done a lot that some people would find pretty unforgivable. And that it's really in in individual. and What you decide to forgive and what you don't. And and forgiveness not, meaning that you excuse the behavior but that you are ready to move on, for from it, but forgiveness doesn't mean that you have an ongoing relationship necessarily so, those are sort of two separate issues right it's like. But if you do too, so if you forgiveness, is for you, not for her if you do decide to forgive her and you're able to do that, we can certainly talk more about that. And then the question is, do I want an ongoing relationship with her and it sounds like you do, to some extent the question, it sounds like is on the table is like to what extent. Does she is she going to be involved in my life and in my relationship and am I going to be vulnerable and open up and trust her with things that are important to me. yeah. So. I mean there's really no one who can answer that except for you and. But. It is probably important for you to think about like what is the level of trust that you have in her."
12241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,And what does. I mean we all have boundaries with our parents or whether we have a super healthy relationship with them or not right there's some level of boundary that's needed because we're adults. yeah so what that boundary is probably going to look and look different. for you than it would for somebody who's had a really healthy relationship with their parents yeah.
12241.0,Patient,yeah well.
416.0,Provider,"So. I mean yeah it tell her don't tell her, I mean yeah it's really up to you, but I think whatever decision you make it has to be one that supports your mental health. In the best possible way."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah and I think it's like. she's very like she calls me like four times a day. And if I don't answer the phone she sends me a text immediately. I mean, she probably had also has like an anxious attachment style."
416.0,Provider,sounds like it yeah.
12241.0,Patient,"But also, I can't like I have a life I can't be the person that she calls four times a day."
416.0,Provider,"Also she's your mom not your daughter. yeah so it's not your responsibility to make her feel better. Right it's that this is where like it's probably healthy for you to think through what kind of a like if I look down the road in five years 10 years 20 years. And I think about what my relationship is with my mom what do I need it to look like like what would healthy look like for me with her knowing with an understanding of her limitations, because we can't change her yeah she's if she is you know deeply. enmeshed in the idea that homosexuality is a sin and she's never going to get past that then we can't look five years down the road and think she's going to be past it because she's that's not likely."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah I I also so I want to say that maybe the day after we had our last session my dad kept calling, and I was not ready to talk to him, so I didn't pick up and he sent me an ugly message saying like I pay your phone bill pick up the phone blah blah blah. So I sent him a message just saying like I am currently in therapy for the things that you have done, and I cannot communicate with you."
416.0,Provider,nicely done.
12241.0,Patient,"yeah I just felt like he was going to continue to call and so he sent a message back saying like. I don't know something like i'm sorry whatever he said I think there's some things we need to iron out, could you call me for 10 minutes and I actually had planned to call him the day got very busy that day and I never did and. He sent me a message saying Okay, well, I guess you're not going to call. I hope, everything goes well, or I don't know some something like that. So he does actually currently pay my cell phone bill."
416.0,Provider,uh huh.
12241.0,Patient,"And i'm trying to decide if i'm just going to let him continue to pay it or if i'm going to get off of his cell phone plan. I mean my mentality is like. Like Tony was very like if he pays for something he has some semblance of control over you and I don't think you should let him do that, but then I was like you know what like I have money, so if he cut my cell phone off I could go get a new cell phone plan, the same day it's like. yeah it's not feel like. um. So I think for now i'm just gonna let him continue to pay it."
416.0,Provider,"I think if you don't buy into the he has control over me. Then he doesn't have control over it. Right, he tried. He tried and you were like uh huh anyway, moving on."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah it's kind of like my mom so she when I went to Louisiana she used her points on her credit card to buy my plane ticket. And when kind of one of the things that like I was just getting fed up with her and then she likes said this. She had called me after the hurricane there and honestly I had been drinking, so I probably shouldn't have even answered the call and I was with my boss, and I put her on speaker phone and. Because, sometimes I wonder, am I crazy or is she actually fucking crazy, and so I put her on speakerphone and my boss, and I are really close so she knows the whole situation, and she said. She she said something about they weren't going to have power for like two months, and I was like well why don't you come stay in my apartment like you're working remotely I can go stay with a friend for like a month you just stay my apartment and. She was like we can't afford the plane tickets, which is just ridiculous, because I know how much money she makes and she whatever. But she was like we used all of our points to bring you to Louisiana like throwing it in my face and my boss was like you need like this is ridiculous like. For her to throw this in your face um but I guess I kind of feel like i'm at the point in life, where like I I don't feel that like I don't feel bad for you, you saying that doesn't make me feel bad for you, that was a life choice you made. But I agree and I guess that's The thing is, like she's also tried to do that is like and like he makes those comments to like you only call me when you need money but it's like. I mean, I know that that's not accurate, but like it's that's the narrative that you want to have for yourself then fine. And I think he."
416.0,Provider,said can't control their narrative.
12241.0,Patient,know and she says those things lot to like you only call when you need something and it's like will I feel like you just tell yourself that I feel Sometimes I feel like she just enjoy sitting in her own misery.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
12241.0,Patient,I don't understand what.
416.0,Provider,"I mean, and you may never because it is what it is."
12241.0,Patient,yeah. I. wonder now if there is because they don't talk and so now I kind of wonder if she's reached out to him and that's why he was calling me so much. Because he doesn't typically do that.
416.0,Provider,Maybe.
12241.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know yeah I i'm not ready to like i'm definitely not ready to have a conversation with him, but I don't think i'm ready to have a conversation with her, but I also worry if I let it go for too long, is that worse."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean. When you say, have a conversation with your meaning the big conversations. Or are you meaning. kind of just a regular everyday conversation."
12241.0,Patient,"No, because I don't think a regular everyday conversation can be had at this point."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so. What is it you need to get out of. Either both of those conversations like what are you hoping to get from those. Emotionally."
12241.0,Patient,"I mean, I guess, from him like I don't really care if I ever have a relationship with him it's more you know my sisters yeah I feel like my the oldest is going to college. And so I feel like it, that will make it easier to have a relationship with her. Because she'll be in college next year. But the. The other sister she's only. So, and he made a comment, the other day. When he was like well, I guess, a couple months ago, when he sort of said some mean things to me, but he was talking about his relationship with them, and he made just like a an offhand comment comment about. Julia, which is the youngest saying, well, I have a good relationship with my other kids and then he stopped himself and said, well, I guess Julian I have an okay relationship and it just kind of makes me. I guess in the back of my mind, I always wonder has he done that to them. But I. don't know if I can make that my responsibility."
416.0,Provider,"it's not your responsibility. I mean, so the person who worked for CPS in me for a really long time. will say to you that you could. Contact child protective services where he lives and let them know. That he did things to you, and that you he has access to young children and you're very concerned about them. I don't know whether or not they would do anything about that, because without any evidence that he's you know done anything to them directly, they may not open it or investigate. Unless they already have information or already had concerns on him and then that might kind of tip it over the edge so that's always an option. But yeah I hear how important it is for you to. To stay connected to your sisters, do you think that he's gonna object, so if you were to say to him, something like because of our history, I don't feel like I can stay connected with you. But my sisters are important to me they are so my sisters and i'd like to stay connected to them, I don't want hostility between us, but I don't really care to have like a serious ongoing relationship with you."
12241.0,Patient,know I don't feel like that's an option.
416.0,Provider,"So, how would they react with that."
12241.0,Patient,"I think he would just say no, I think, honestly. I think, honestly, he would be."
416.0,Provider,A smoke detector.
12241.0,Patient,"yeah it is she's in there cooking dinner, and it goes off of him go so. I think, honestly, he would be afraid that I would say something to them, so I think his reaction would be no because he wouldn't want. I think, especially if something has happened to them, he would be terrified that we would all maybe talk about it i'm not sure."
416.0,Provider,"yeah, so this is where the emotional blackmail lives right that you would have to stay connected to him and not bring up the big ugly thing. In order to stay connected to your sisters, is that what i'm hearing yeah."
12241.0,Patient,"And I think that's why I haven't ever said anything to him. Also, his wife. When when we met his wife was like 32 or 33. So she was extremely young, I mean I was 18 so she wasn't you know that much older than me. and So she's still quite young. and I guess she also is one of those women who, she was very happy. To stay home and not work anymore, which i'm not no judgment to her, but she's very suburban she's like i'm Clichy mom person and she will protect her lifestyle. Over anything and so she is not a girls girl. She would choose not to believe those things, and I would be almost willing to bet that she would try her best to not see anything else that might be going on with her kids just to protect her lifestyle."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
12241.0,Patient,So I don't I think there would be like. Very much disdain towards me and. Like she would definitely take the stance of like she's a liar kind of thing.
416.0,Provider,"How about this, the the youngest again. The youngest just 15. yeah so only three more years and she's up to. I mean it doesn't leave you with any really wonderful choices."
12241.0,Patient,"yeah so I just kind of thought you know, like i'm my the oldest lauren she's 17 and we're friends on social media and I thought you know when she moves out and goes to college i'll probably send her a message and try and have a relationship with her yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah and then you can connect with the the I mean it's only a matter of time before they're they're all out right. So you'll have that opportunity and then whether or not you stay, I mean you can keep your data to an arm's length and then whether or not you stay in touch with him and his wife after that is up to you, but fortunately it's only for a couple more years."
12241.0,Patient,yeah and I think it's it's also really weird because I have so many siblings but I was never raised with any of them. uh huh oh. I don't feel connected to any of them.
416.0,Provider,You know where I just realized something can I put him on hold for one second i'm just having a panic moment for one just realized that my fiance needs to go pick up my child before five and I don't think he knows that. Speaking of neglectful parents okay i'll be right back. I got all wrapped up in our conversation that I was like oh my God the time.
12241.0,Patient,"Okay, I understand those things kind of now."
416.0,Provider,My bad also how you can forget your own child my bad.
12241.0,Patient,"Yes. You know. We have that it also I kind of worry like. Tony has made a few comments never negatively. Always kind of laughing but she is extremely emotionally intelligent, so I do know that there is some truth behind the laughter type thing of. You know my mom before she passed away and I were very, very, very close and Tony has made jokes about like you know you're gonna have to put the baby down when you have a baby you're gonna have to let the baby be its own person. and"
416.0,Provider,I.
12241.0,Patient,"wonder about those things because. Because of the way my mom and I were super close and, on top of losing my mom."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
12241.0,Patient,"I worry about. How I will how people with anxious attachment deal with having children because, clearly, my biological mother did does not deal with that very well."
416.0,Provider,"So. I think it's worth exploring maybe before you kind of get too much in your head about this, what she really means by that. Because. Yes, it can be challenging for people with anxious attachment to. Just like kids be kids all of that, but you're working on all of that. and The baby, I mean when they're really babies you don't have to put them down that's they need you like, they need a lot of you there's also a way, a lot of different parenting styles, you know, like they're. Your you being really close to your adoptive mom and. there's a lot of ways to keep kids close. And, have you know prioritize your relationship with them without. Really feeding into that anxious attachment right."
12241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"there's a lot of ways to do that, but I think you can cross that bridge when you come to it, you are such an introspective person I, I know that you will. be questioning your every move when you have children. yeah and probably talking it over and I don't see you just sort of blindly stumbling forward around this."
12241.0,Patient,yeah. yeah um. I definitely already think a lot about it so. yeah sure i'm sure I will read 500 books about it.
416.0,Provider,yeah. I don't think you have to worry about it quite yet.
12241.0,Patient,No Definitely not.
416.0,Provider,"So miss Sarah we are out of time, and I, my my goal for you, if I can give you some homework is to really start paying attention more on the future tripping that you're doing. it's causing you a lot of lot of stress."
12241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And so, working on trying to counter some of those statements for you."
12241.0,Patient,yeah no I agree.
416.0,Provider,"and good luck with school we're already scheduled on the 19th, so we should be all set. yeah and yeah."
12241.0,Patient,I like to put it in my calendar before so that I don't. miss it okay 4pm right.
