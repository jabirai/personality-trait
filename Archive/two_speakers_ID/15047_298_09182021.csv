Or you can come on board with our program and we are a mental health program so I get to know you a lot better. So what that means is. You go to therapy once every other week and that's done on zoom. and Then you go to group therapy that's done once a week for the first month and after the first month if you keep all your appointments, you can request to go down to twice a month it's one hour long it's done on zoom in the therapist and myself are both there it's not really a time to. it's not really a time to talk about a lot of personal things as much as it's a time for skill building whatever topic the therapist brings to the group and then of course you can make appointments with me for medication, if you so choose so. there's option.
