16322.0,Patient,"i'm the reason for my treatments. This year I I lost a family member my brother. it's been very, very hard for me. i'm also going through some symptoms, with my eye my right eye, I had two surgeries. You know it's it's constantly watering and I think that's what gets me anxiety because I I feel like the pressure of the water in my eye, you know it's really hard for me to read something or you know just to focus and. Just with the family to my family's going through a really hard time with the loss of my brother his kids. You know, there are adults but there's been a lot of misunderstandings and it's just it's just been overwhelming, for me, for his last two and dealing with my I situation i'm taking care of it through kick hospital. i've had two surgeries out out of the two surgeries my right eyes watering constantly and it just really it's really aggravates me. i'm sorry my sister's calm calling me, can you see that."
148.0,Provider,"No, it just it took off your video that."
16322.0,Patient,I know i'm. I don't want to lose you.
148.0,Provider,that's okay yeah i'm.
16322.0,Patient,"Are you there. Yes, good idea."
148.0,Provider,"So i'm very, very sorry for your loss of your brother. We can talk more about you know your grieving process around that."
16322.0,Patient,Sorry i'm good no. that's okay oh sorry no during the holidays its own Horn.
148.0,Provider,Right yes. that's okay.
16322.0,Patient,"No problem. We had some issues with his kids you know they can accept that their dad is gone they're very edgy with talking, you know it's you have. We had a meeting last week and we kind of like solve there was a misunderstanding of who said what and pointing fingers, you know because of my brother's loss and the way. With the pandemic and everything you know the way he passed away he just all the sudden you know with a fall, he was. He just. Was that made it to the hospital, he was diabetic going for dialysis and you know, he was just very tired with dialysis and in his separation, with his wife, you know he had to come and live with my sister and. And things just change with his kids of the way he was his living situation you know, he was very happy being there with at my mom's house with my sister and. and His kids were like very edgy of you know, the way he didn't just he just stopped caring for himself, he was tired, you know he went through a depression, because of the loss of his daughter, I mean of his wife. So it just created a lot of issues with his kids and their father, and you know it was like walking on eggshells, with them, because we had to be very careful what we said because they got very offended you know, so it was, but we took care of the meeting that sweet, we had a family. meeting at my mom or my mom and my dad has been deceased for many years, but my sister's living there was living there with my brother. But to make a long story short, it, it was terrible the way he was just with a fall, you know he just went he deteriorated. and actually you know, he was put in a nursing home on the floor with pandemic. People. I say he was on the floor with the. People that. Get like he was like in a in an elderly home where they come from, like a hospital and it was back in March, when my brother passed away this year and. Just the way this whole process the hospital and everything I mean the kids were very angry and I understand you know because they couldn't go in to see him we had to do like a video chat like this at the hospital and it was really hard for them for all of us and. He was just he just left to quick, it was just all of a sudden happen and then going through my surgeries with my eyes and now you know i'm still dealing with the tearing and i'm taking care of that and so. i'm going back to my doctor at cat I went back last week, and she wants to do. She says what she wanted to do botox was one of the options, which is, I totally refuse because it's not guaranteed, and it could cause drooping in my I just a lot of. I don't want to go that route, but like she said, you know we may want to do and third surgery on your wife right I to stop the may be, it can like she said that their time may be a charm because what I have is my tear ducts their clock. and causes my water on my eyes to feel and i'm constantly with a tissue and it's just like I could be anywhere in my I just starts running like i'm crying on my right side. And it really gets very. irritating because sometimes I met somewhere where you know i'm just all of a sudden, I have to reach in for a tissue and it's just you know. I don't know it's just very frustrating for me it's getting I mean I can't it's not guaranteed with what the doctor said, with the botox but I don't want to go that route because of that and getting injections every six months and. And then she she wanted she also offered another surgery or they could put a stent in my eye, and you know leave it there permanently, but it may require to do several surgeries for that. And she says, I hardly wouldn't recommend that because also too it's not guarantee she says it also is something that goes with age, you know and and. The watering you know if you want you could just live with it, but I i'm not like throughout the day it just fills up with water even like when i'm reading a piece of paper you know it's just very hard for me to. frustrating it's yeah."
148.0,Provider,it's frustrating contributing to the depression.
16322.0,Patient,"yeah and and that's what i'm thinking to you know, can it be something like my depression, you know my my I don't know my I get out and I get like I say irritated. and see because you know I can sometimes I can't read something or i'm doing something in the tearing just starts where like if i'm doing gardening there goes the watering oh my I you know it's just it's very irritating and it's."

16322.0,Patient,Especially if.
148.0,Provider,"you're feeling frustrated right when you feel the watering happen, you know, maybe try taking some deep breaths. And really calming yourself down because any stress and frustration coming up that that makes. Stress can make any physical symptoms worse right."
16322.0,Patient,"Right and I started that excuse me, I thought you know i've been trying me and my sister go walking at least like three times a week and you know she's retired so i'm like. we're helping each other to cope with the loss of my brother by. Doing this and it does release. A lot of tension, you know we walk in We talked it it's like she's like my my therapy to you know she's yeah. She we we help each other."

148.0,Provider,"hey yeah, this is a safe space for you to be able to you know process these emotions in without these emotions because there's a lot of pain underneath everything right now that you're feeling a lot. And there's no time frame for healing right."
16322.0,Patient,"No, there is a."
148.0,Provider,make it a time.

148.0,Provider,"hear that yeah anything that you can do for yourself, right now, that is, therapeutic and you know allows you to release some of you know, these strong emotions going on inside your body is as important that's powerful. Yes, so I hear you're doing that, through your walking getting support from your sister and your son, especially doing the gardening I would love to see you and start to incorporate some deep breathing throughout the day. Just a couple minutes here and there, just a couple you know few deep breaths to really let out the stress toxins in your body that you hold on so deeply throughout the day and release them in that tension that you feel. Yes, but I think that you're doing a lot of great things right now."
16322.0,Patient,"yeah you to you, I did see you know, as I walked I walked at the nearby park here is the city park and they have a senior Center there um I even thought a baby joining yoga is that i've never done it."
