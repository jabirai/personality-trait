760.0,Provider,hi. here. hi Nancy. How are you.
13487.0,Patient,I am good i'm really good I just woke up from a nap so i'm pretty good.
760.0,Provider,Okay So how have things been since the last time we spoke.
13487.0,Patient,"Better we went home last Saturday from when I was with my parents my husband's parents my mom wasn't here that helps that kind of helped my anxiety that she was in here um she hasn't been here since unfortunately she actually got coven that last weekend. Okay, but. i've been taking care of herself, I have been talking to her so that's that's a good thing you know it's been civil i'll. I did tell her yesterday over the phone because she's like she's very concerned about my daughter, because my daughter ended up getting bronchitis so. I was at the pharmacy yesterday, so I was telling my mom look like tell you before so he was going on with my daughter. I need to set some boundaries with you, you as a mother from mother to mother, I cannot have you tell me how to mother, my kid like if we're going to have a relationship of. any sort on a relationship with me or your granddaughter we need. grace, so I told her I gave her an ultimatum like, if you want a relationship with me and no fighting you know, we want to get along with each other, you need to stop telling me what to do as a month, you can tell me what to do, as you know me being your child. But as being a mother, please stop mom just stop i'm going to mother, my kid my own way and you're going to Mother me your own way and that's that."
760.0,Provider,And it's a different thing mothering and adult woman versus mothering that. Child a completely different thing.
13487.0,Patient,"I you know, I was like."
760.0,Provider,I was trying to show you put you put some good boundaries down.
13487.0,Patient,"I did. It Okay, so I hope she stays sticks to that Okay, so I feel I feel better that I told her that and we're really about it, there was no casino there was, it was very civil conversation, so I hope she sticks to her word that she's gonna you know, keep her grounds."
760.0,Provider,"So everything seems like you have. put up a good boundary and so far, so good, the way."
13487.0,Patient,"For now. For now it's just since right now she's ill she can't really come and she know she can't because of the coven but i'm thinking after I want to set some boundaries, where she doesn't come and visit us so often so that's my next step."
760.0,Provider,"yeah because you know she's giving you that space you're you're paying some even if it's a small amount of rent there may be some laws about that you might want to check into. yeah because my understanding, if there's any amount of money you're paying, even if it's below market value. That might be. There, but you want to have some legal rights to that so. Great you know if you use, you should have the right to your own enjoyment of your own home."
13487.0,Patient,"You know, for yourself is."
760.0,Provider,"your daughter, and that so so I feel pretty pleased that you were able to set up those good boundaries."
13487.0,Patient,me too. me too.
760.0,Provider,Okay that's good so so the anxieties that really that is much better now.
13487.0,Patient,For now yeah it's been good it's been calm yes yay mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,And what are some of the things that you are using doing to cope like.
13487.0,Patient,"i'm packing up some stuff that's been really keeping me busy and kind of like how motivation, I guess it's like a motivation kind of thing so packing up my stuff I kind of list looks like bare minimum stuff for my room to just use."
760.0,Provider,Oh you're contemplating finding another home and yes.
13487.0,Patient,There is yes. So that's been helping that's been helping.
760.0,Provider,"All right, so what else has been happening, let me see. Have you been able to get out and take walks like we talked about and."
13487.0,Patient,"um I have been going out more with my kid I take her. Maybe not so much walks but like aaron's I do run a lot of errands with her. mm hmm like driving wise so maybe not walks but just running errands like in the car going to stores. Today I was planning to take her to the mall when she wakes up, so I was trying to do something with her, because my husband's here, it says one day off. So we're just trying to have a family day today, but other than that no I haven't done the walks but I had been out of my house to go do things but specifically walks no okay."
760.0,Provider,Is that still something that you want to work parts. Like to manage yeah well it's not for the purpose of. Mental health for the purpose of burning energy.
13487.0,Patient,"Yes, I am I. feeling better at that."
760.0,Provider,yeah cuz I know you're keeping busy with the. With the. packing.
13487.0,Patient,Inside yes and.
760.0,Provider,Preparing yeah but it's good to get out get out of the House and. Is and burn some of that okay So how are things with your husband.
13487.0,Patient,we're pretty good we're pretty good we haven't thought this whole thing with me and my mom has kind of kept us me and him strong so that's that's a good thing.
760.0,Provider,So you've been you've been leaning upon one another and supporting one another.
13487.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. Very well, to."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, okay Okay, so how about the weed smoking, how was that."
13487.0,Patient,"I still do it it's just I I cut back, like how you said to try to like buy another hobby so I but i've been trying to find other hobbies because I know like once I move out. i'm not going to have like that freedom, where I could just like smoke whatever I want so i'm gonna have to like it used to like cutting back so i've been cutting back I. kind of want to get back into our crew shane I used to love, I still love blankets, when I was younger so i'm trying to get back into that. Okay, so yeah I mean, I feel I feel pretty proud of myself like cutting back. Okay."
760.0,Provider,Good So what are some of the other things that you've been working on fencing.
13487.0,Patient,"um. You see, mostly like. Mostly was like the home mom thing the whole movie now um. I every day. Not like not like anxiety, but, like every day I get. Like a swamp panic attack only because but it's minor only because, like I can't find anything to like move out to like even I was even told that section eight homes are like hard to be putting on a waiting list so like it's all that."
760.0,Provider,"For the stress of. Yes, finding something."
13487.0,Patient,"Suitable yes that's that's a little stress, for me, because my friend is like on the same boat and I put myself not not that i'm putting myself in her position but. She makes a little bit more money than my husband and she kind of has the same boat, where i'm not working so her her baby Father isn't working so there's like. So it's kind of like the same Bush and they're homeless they're more homeless than I am yeah I still have my mom's house to live and she doesn't and she has a better job you know she works for Kaiser and. Right now she's on pain for hotels and stuff you know, to live with her kid. And i'm like shoot like and I thinking my husband like he works for the cheesecake factory it's not as well as Kaiser and yet you know if we will be out on the streets, we would struggle, even more, because he doesn't have like really well well paid job so it's like. it's a lot to take in it's lots of process, I was like shoots. And she makes more money than he does like and there's No two incomes like how there isn't what those will I personally i'm choosing not to work right now for my own mental my mental sanity for right now but. I just have a lot to think of I think that about a lot so i'm an. Over thinker I overanalyze everything."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's kind of a catch 22 you want to be you want to take time to be a mom and you want to take time to work on yourself and your mental health, but at the same time there's a trade off with that, because of the income."
13487.0,Patient,that you have the earnings yes.
760.0,Provider,"So talk to me Francine about what are any long maybe long term goals you have with that. As far as employment, do you."
13487.0,Patient,"Employment um. I, for now, since the most part, I don't want my mom babysitting it's only me, so I don't want Anyone watching my kid but me um I was thinking long term part time job when. Because my husband right now he's not like asking me for like to get jobs, so if he's willing to do it right now, like by himself. And you know even with us moving out maybe long term wise once we're stable, we have a little place of our own what whatever it is, you know studio apartment whatever it is that we call home um. And I can see, you know his schedule working around you know, like in time, maybe like when she's like three or four. Like when she goes to school, I was thinking like more like what she started like school a little bit like three times a week I can like I was looking into a part time job. Because I was a full time I was a full time employee and I loved it I love being a full time employee dishes. It became overwhelming, I guess, because me being full time, but I also wanted to be a full time mother and me juggling both of those and also coming home to clean my house, it took a lot out of me. I was literally from I was. A full time employee from February to October I enjoyed it i've been a worker, since I was 16 i'm not trying to be lazy and I get a job it's not that is just I don't trust, a lot of people with my kids."
760.0,Provider,And I know I know. Well that's asking about the long term. yeah.
13487.0,Patient,part time when she may be has when she's going to school. That that's what i'm thinking okay for now. yeah I can have something to do.
760.0,Provider,"And what do you think has changed with your mental health to get you to a place where you feel ready, you know once your daughters in school, and all that, but what. kinds of changes for your mental health, do you. Put you in a place where you're going to feel ready to take on that extra."
13487.0,Patient,"One place in my own piece of somewhere where you know, I have a stable relationship with my mother, where where she knows boundaries like she knows more than to call me before. Now me, I want to be mentally like mentally ready to like because I had a lot of mental breakdowns at work."
760.0,Provider,And I want to see you again okay.
13487.0,Patient,"yeah I had to have my director send me home a couple times, it was very embarrassing but um. That, I think that has a lot to do with it, I think I need to be in my little piece in my own place with me my husband and my daughter, where I know I could come home to a clean house, I can come home to my husband, taking care of my daughter, and not someone else I taking care of her. um and I know that I can wake up go to work and outwork have the mentality of being at work and not having to think like oh who's taking care of my kid or or having so many things I worked, because that's with me like when i'm at work. I let my no. issues affect me and."
760.0,Provider,I don't want a.
13487.0,Patient,"job and I was doing that with my old job I was letting a lot of my personal phone issues and I was bringing them to work and it wasn't healthy for me, it was not healthy."
760.0,Provider,So what can you do to keep yourself from. Bringing your personal issues to your job.
13487.0,Patient,It would always been like that.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
13487.0,Patient,"To even it was on when I had my first job as at in and out in and out burger. I was like that too. I would become, and I would get very emotional I would think of something that's happening like. In the moment of like like my life but i'm at work, and I would just start getting crying or whatever the circumstances, and then i'm gonna have to ask my boss to let me go and depending on circumstances, they would in or they would."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds like an area that might be a barrier for you to have work with you know, even if we just don't even consider childcare issues. With your daughter So what are some things that that you would like is that something you would like to work on like quieting your mind ruminating of your mind."
13487.0,Patient,your mind.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so I would like to talk to you about some mindfulness Okay, and we talked about mindfulness before."
13487.0,Patient,I don't think so.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, do what you can you tell me what you know about mindfulness."
13487.0,Patient,"No, no i'm gonna i'm gonna shoot a plank with this, but now."
760.0,Provider,That you don't know what it is.
13487.0,Patient,"I feel like I do like in my own way, maybe with like I feel like i'm going to just tell you like I don't want to confuse the way I don't know like in my own words being mindful, to me, is. Like. i'm thinking. I honestly Doc i'm sorry, no."
760.0,Provider,"No, you don't mind."
13487.0,Patient,"No, no."
760.0,Provider,"I just want to know what your understanding is because a lot of people get confused with with the principle that's why I kind of asked you that question. Okay, it is a state of mind and a practice so typically when people try to implement mindfulness into their lives, it takes a little bit of time to get used to. Because it's. very different from the way we think most of the time. there's two parts two main parts to mindfulness number one is present moment awareness. Meaning i'm not worried about what happened in the past and i'm not like projecting and stressing about what's what's going to happen in the future be here in the moment exactly where we are right now. And then the other concept behind that or the other part of it would be. working towards taking a step back from judging the situation kind of stepping back and observing it not trying to fix it not trying to change it kind of accepting it in place doesn't mean you have to like it. But just kind of an acceptance of it and so that's it's a little bit confusing because there's those two parts, do you have any questions."
13487.0,Patient,"For you, that good, no, no, I don't but now, now that you made me realize what it means the first part, where I have to accept it know."
760.0,Provider,"That it's not. it's a practice, and so the language, the language, I have to kind of like nope that's not mindfulness. Okay it's. Because mindfulness is accepting it so if i'm struggling with the concept of mindfulness then i'm. gonna have to accept that i'm struggling with the concept of mindfulness. it's it's it's the way we view things it's this you know this rumination. Okay don't worry. Going you know, on and on and on."
13487.0,Patient,I think that's how you describe my anxiety that's that's what I am I that's what I do all day.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, so. it's. So it's it's a practice trying to be in the present moment and making an effort. to let go of judgment and if I can't let go of judgment then i'm just going to say okay I seem to be judging this right now I seem to be anxious about this, let me just take a step back and like kind of watch myself observe myself, being aware of my thinking. Being where my emotions and then also making a special time to pay attention to my other senses, what are the things in the moment that I see right now, what are some of the you know. What right hearing. What ours, you know what is my right now i'm sitting at a desk and I can feel the wood on my desk that you know that kind of thing just to kind of slow down the mind a little bit does that make some kind of sense."
13487.0,Patient,"Or does. It does, and I think I think I have issues with mindfulness because. I my mind is like maybe running like 100 miles per hour so like the way the way you described it is like wow that would be for me almost impossible, but obviously it is possible, because I have to not i'm Sorry, I have to, but I would um. have to exercise my brain to not be such an over analyzer I think that's my problem. I overthink everything."
760.0,Provider,Everything okay.
13487.0,Patient,"So you're it's annoying it's annoying so for you to try to help me to not do that, then yeah I greatly I would take it, because it is frustrating and it gets overwhelming make."
760.0,Provider,"overthink everything think in terms of baby steps you know your daughter when she learned how to walk you know when you were a little baby, you know we have to go through all this, these developmental."
13487.0,Patient,"mile rides and we do this, little by little by little."
760.0,Provider,"And mindfulness is a lot like that you're going to take a little baby step from where you are today with your with your rumination and your worry and start making movements in this other direction, a little by little. make sense. Yes, that. would be really bad yes Okay, so one way to do baby steps. You could start with some of the more simplistic exercises like the five senses and if you wanted to, we could we could practice we could practice, the five senses right now. Okay five senses let's let's kind of take turns with this. But before we do that can you kind of rank for me on a scale of one to 10 where do you find your anxiety right now."
13487.0,Patient,i'm like a two.
760.0,Provider,"A two. Well let's let's go ahead and practice, the five senses, even though your anxiety is kind of low. Okay, so, so I will take turns i'll start and i'm going to look around my little Office here and i'm going to name five things in my office that I see or in your case you'll do it whatever room you're in."
13487.0,Patient,So.
760.0,Provider,"I see I see I see your face on my computer screen, I see a sign or a picture above my computer, I see the paint on the wall, I see my printer and my mouse."
13487.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"I think that was five things. It was buildings yeah, so why don't you take a turn in the game five things you see in your in your."
13487.0,Patient,"OK. I see my daughter's minnie mouse. house play house i'm. In my storage three storage unit boxes i'm the window to the outside just nice view. Your roles paintings. Okay, and one last thing. On my daughter's dresser my daughter."
760.0,Provider,Okay next we're gonna move on to things that we hear so i'm going to say that I hear the sound of my own voice speaking right now. I feel I hear like this home I don't know if it's coming through my. ear things. I hear a dog barking in the neighborhood and kids playing next door.
13487.0,Patient,Oh that's gonna be a tough one um i'm going to have to I can't have five because I.
760.0,Provider,Literally and or things that.
13487.0,Patient,Fourth.
760.0,Provider,And one thing you can hear.
13487.0,Patient,"Okay cuz yeah I hear nothing but quietness mean you talking like us. I do hear the train, even with the door with the window closed I do get to go to train. And an occasional dog, yes, even with the window closed and it's really well toes I do your dogs So yes, for okay."
760.0,Provider,"So the next thing i'm going to move into three things I feel, and when I use the word feel i'm not talking about your emotions i'm talking about physical kinds of sensations I feel the warmth of my sweater I feel the. The cushion of my chair, I feel the flatness of the floor under my feet. And I guess that was it because it was three."
13487.0,Patient,Okay um I feel the hardwood floors I will it's actually carpet because i'm sitting on the floor i'm I feel the fuzziness of those socks and i'm wearing because it's freezing in my house and I feel the warmth of my sweater because again it's freezing in my house. So those are the things I feel.
760.0,Provider,"Maybe you feel a combination of the one of the sweater but then the coolness in other places, maybe on your face."
13487.0,Patient,"Yes, my face is pretty cold guess cuz house is freezing."
760.0,Provider,just see so so paying attention. yeah so it's it's about it's to focus your energy away from all this rumination on more present moment stuff. Okay.
13487.0,Patient,And then say okay.
760.0,Provider,"One thing I smell. Which is my air freshener in the room, and then one thing I taste, which is. I guess i've been drinking water, so I kind of taste they'll have like a water taste in my mouth."
13487.0,Patient,Moving but smells like nothing but it's Nice because it doesn't smell nasty in here um. and taste. Maybe the last thing I did was brush my teeth so maybe like the minty part of the toothbrush I mean that's right to face to face.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right there we go so that's that's the five senses. Okay, so that can be used anytime you find your your anxiety hit a six on that scale or go higher. mindfulness can also be you, you can do like an actual meditation and there's online there's all kinds of places to observe meditations and things online."
13487.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"You could do that just go on YouTube or what have you. Or you could do mindful activity, mindful walk or perhaps if you're if you're packing if you're packing, for instance, because he said. isn't packing you could do mindful packing you could you know notice the sensation of every object the smoothness or the fabric, or how it feels how it smells that the census as your. package being in the moment. And, and maybe setting up a time to practice mindfulness for a short period of time, even as little as one minute, but maybe tried to make it at least five minutes like. Three times a day would be a baby step towards turning down that rumination."
13487.0,Patient,anything to stop overanalyzing So yes. i'll do that i'll try to do that five minutes three dining.
760.0,Provider,morning sometime in the afternoon and then maybe towards the.
13487.0,Patient,Before like before.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, before, that is fine too yeah. Does that sound like a good plan."
13487.0,Patient,"Yes, I need to you need to try."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you tried that experiment. Over the next couple of weeks before we meet next time. Okay okay."
13487.0,Patient,that's fine yeah definitely.
760.0,Provider,Is there anything else that you that you've that's been that you need to work on or want to talk about or.
13487.0,Patient,um no actually i've been pretty content. so far.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
13487.0,Patient,"yeah i've been i've been on I feel fine, I feel I feel happy, I feel like Okay, you know I like."
760.0,Provider,"You did a really good job with the boundaries with your mom and so. So that in and of itself, you can you can tell yourself by your make you're making progress and she probably will try to push back because she's used to you know, we want to fall back into our comfortable normal habits. So you know it tried to practice this mindfulness to help you cope with that and then continue to set the boundaries with her. Because. it's it's important it's important for your mental health and you're just not going to be able to sustain a relationship with her it's probably gonna be all bad for everybody."
13487.0,Patient,It is.
760.0,Provider,"You know, we can set some we can work on setting some boundaries and other ways to so. Did you ever get a chance to call the legal."
13487.0,Patient,"I did I did she actually presented me with thumb to civic codes that I can tell my mom she happened to be a mother of five so she was like trying to tell me like you know i'm telling you this was mom. Maybe her you telling her that you're leaving she didn't take it well you know and she's kind of like. The abandonment issue isn't taking she's not taking that well so she kind of explained to me like Okay, maybe that's why she's doing that, but she's coming in, as a mom Madeleine board so. Really, you need to you know you need to tell her that you know as even as a daughter, you have rights as a tenant so she sent me some codes that I can present to my mom in writing, you know, just in case my mom doesn't comply or whatever. I have something in writing, and you know, God forbid, have to call the COPs or. But yes, I do have."
760.0,Provider,You have some tools to us to practice some.
