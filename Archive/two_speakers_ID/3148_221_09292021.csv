221.0,Provider,In your car living in your car and being so. yeah.
3148.0,Patient,"Oh yeah um it was horrible. yeah was awful it was just like you know how it is and just like that anxiety and like stretching and not wanting. I was like seeing as you can see commercials. Really yeah to just like get some kind of help, because I was just getting worse, you know worse and worse and worse and then finally planning, my friend showed up and. and yeah and I got some and and they've been on like my pretty much my regular dose since then."
