It could contribute to the overall loan okay. it's like a copy of your labs on make sure that you get them in order to facilitate to your primary care provider i'm overall, this time numbers are a little off, but overall good report. i'd like to ask you about the occurrence of some signs and symptoms. If you're experiencing any of them currently are most recently I, like you to tell me it's a really long list i'll start at the head and kind of work, my way down to the toes okay.

17955.0,Patient,"Sometimes I do feel like I don't. I don't know if this is for sure, but sometimes I feel like my hearing is not as good as it used to be, but that might just be like a placebo effect. Because, sometimes I have trouble hearing people clearly."
498.0,Provider,"And, have you informed your primary care provider about the difficulty with regard to you."
17955.0,Patient,"know I mean I never thought serious, but then again like. i'm not like. My reference point is just like myself, like, I sometimes I just attributed to me not paying attention so that could also be the problem."

17955.0,Patient,"No, I don't think I have a problem with no, you know those just a one time so."

17955.0,Patient,"I say yes, I get frequent headaches. When when they happen i'm not really sure sometimes they'll be just when i'm at home or sometimes they'll be. Like usually happens like in the mornings, and sometimes it happens, like at night. And as for the dizziness I think that's only occurred when that one time and then. that's that should be about it as for like loss of control or what would you say coordination. I think I have like trouble like cornelius up if you notice I kind of walked funny but at the same time, sometimes I just attributed to my my foot my left foot, which is a flat."
498.0,Provider,Okay.

17955.0,Patient,i'm not really besides acne.
498.0,Provider,"and How do you feel about. Moving forward and participating in. Individual and group therapy, Mr Chavez and individual therapy will give you an opportunity to explore some of the difficulties that have been plaguing us for the last 10 years that are causing difficulty with regards to management of your mood attention difficulty with sleeping. group will give you a chance to check in with both myself and your therapist in between your visits and then, if you like. You could start you on a low dose in a depressant today, along with a low dose in a histamine in order to prove improve your. sleep quality and ability to fall asleep. And it has to me, while also assist with management of anxiety and then it could remain in place until things in therapy provide you with some overall. reinforcement towards management of your symptoms right now and then we can plan to take you off of the medication. Or you can just start with therapy and see how that goes medication is not and it's not. mandated at this point."
17955.0,Patient,"I think. i've been wanting to try therapy for a while, like actual therapy, because I never really got the chance. And I want to give it a shot, but at the same time, you know that might take a while and. As for that the presence of antidepressants. i'm not sure if that would be the best call I mean i'm not a doctor, so I would you know. it's just I think I have something underlying because i've had good days, and then I have bad days and like it sort of goes like up and down where it's. Like i'll have like i'll just stay in a good mood for a long time and then all sudden like those sort of drop, and then you know. And I don't think the antidepressants so like i'm not sure if they'll help or not, I think. I want to get diagnosed, or like see diagnosis, to see if I have ADHD."
498.0,Provider,"I like to go back to something that you mentioned, you mentioned that you have good days, and you have bad days and earlier when I asked you about get days, you said that they last those good episodes last about a day at a time, tell me about what you characterizing is good days."
17955.0,Patient,"i'd say just like when I wake up and i'm like i'm in a good mood I mean not even really in a good mood, just like a like as a positive mood, I guess, I would say we're. Because I can't really describe it, but. Like i'll have times, where it seems like my mood it can't be really changed. Because i'll just be like. How do you say like if something bad happens at work like it won't really put me down as much versus like if i'm having a bad day and i'm my you know my mind is like in a very negative state and it ends up like just dropping you know, like. So I got become very irritable on a bad day and like I can't really like focus on what i'm doing versus a good day, where I feel like I can focus on what i'm doing and."
498.0,Provider,"So. The thing about your mood is that. Though it appears to be present and. Only gauge your emotion. I think many of us. I think many of us take for granted, how much of an overall affect our mood can have on us. If our mood is off and it causes us. increasing variety and difficulty with attention and concentration in the neck spills over to cause us with difficulty to sleep, it has a compounding effect. And then, something that you just mentioned, like you just said when you're having not those on those days aren't low your attention and ability to concentrate is okay. So one way to possibly correct. Your attention and concentration is to also improve your mood improving your mood can happen. and positive domino effect on lowering your anxiety. Improving your ability to sleep. and improving your ability to concentrate and focus. And so it's just. One consideration of a strategy in in, let me also say that nothing is permanent. Determining best steps in order to manage your overall mental health or take some strategy and then some revision of some strategy and then some further revision of strategy. So there were able to determine what works best for you, based on your presentation, so the recommendation of antidepressant. is just something that will start with it's not something that you'll be mandated to remain with and again it's not something that you have to start today's just something that i'd like for you to consider. And we will also. continue to re evaluate you for. ADHD. Management of other moves that you report as well, what it sounds like you're reporting right now is a combination of. Chronic low mood based on the symptoms that you report and some exciting incident difficulty sleeping."
17955.0,Patient,"Okay um. yeah I mean. I think, to start with therapy, I mean how effective is therapy, because it just seems like it would be someone talking to me, but the thing is like if people had talked to like I talked to my dad and I talked to my friends, but then like. Like so i'm not sure if don't do anything really different because, obviously, like they can recommend be like you know, to stop maybe eating so much, but I feel like there's something like bigger at the room. Because i've always sort of been like that, like even since I was a kid I had trouble focusing my guy I always like used to daydream ally and I always used to like to sleep my seat. You know, and obviously like that sort of stuff is supposed to go away like once you become a I guess like adolescent but, like, I feel like. it's hard to explain, but I still have that problem where i'm like always daydreaming and I don't know if that's like normal, because I know everyone like daydreams once a while and everyone like loses focus, but I feel like I lose focus to easily. Where my mind, is just like. A latches onto one thought and and never liked stops that train of thought until like I realized like oh yeah I had to be doing something."
498.0,Provider,"will continue to assess for that, but I have to tell you that I believe psychotherapy is very powerful when. it's when it's engaged in regularly. it's it's it is for lack of a better term just talk therapy, but it's not like talking to a parent or a friend, because it's a completely free space that's non biased. And you're free to dive into any topic any subject matter without concern for how the other person is going to perceive it especially someone in close proximity to you because there are some things that may or may not include them in you may find yourself. Trying to discuss things in a way that. protects them from. The perception of the conversation therapy allows your complete completely free space in order to explore whatever it is that concerns you that's a car team. And then find in explore ways for you to perceive how that's affecting you presently you know things as far back as childhood so psychotherapy is very, very powerful and, in my opinion it's the basis of all. Mental health improvement, the medication helps with the symptoms, the cycle therapy helps you explore and resolve the origin."
17955.0,Patient,yeah definitely i'll give it a shot them.
498.0,Provider,And will you be interested and would you be interested and available to engage in therapy twice a month and then individual their individual to be twice a month and then in group therapy twice a month.
17955.0,Patient,"group therapy. I mean sounds interesting but um I mean I don't know how comfortable, I am just sharing, like all my. All my problems with a bunch of people."
498.0,Provider,"Well, how do you feel about group therapy will give you a chance to check in with me, should you change your mind about medication management, however, you can do individual therapy three times a month in group therapy once a month until. you're comfortable with progressing forward group therapy is a space where you can participate at a level that's comfortable for you it's not like a personal session where you'll be expected to share your innermost thoughts, you can share in a space that you're okay with.
