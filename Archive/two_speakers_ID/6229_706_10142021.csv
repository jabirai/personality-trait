706.0,Provider,Elliot no show for bpm. There we go.
6229.0,Patient,"Finally, figured it out Hello."
706.0,Provider,Well zoom is sometimes a little finicky.
6229.0,Patient,"yeah it seemed I seen where you sent me the request, and I said okay so allow it, and it still did it yeah. it's just weird sometimes. you'll have to excuse me i'm sorry i'm super sick right now."
706.0,Provider,"No that's okay that's that's okay there's a lot of people super sick right now, because everybody took their masks off and so now everything's floating around."
6229.0,Patient,I you know I actually went to walmart earlier and I feel like I was maybe I may be seen to people with their mouse going uh huh.
706.0,Provider,"yeah nobody's really wearing them anymore so and even people that have had their vaccination, they can still get coven it just isn't as bad, but the. You know, carry other things and carry coven, for that matter, too, so it's just."
6229.0,Patient,"Well, I actually I went and got tested two days ago me and my one year old son and we both came back negative so. So I don't really know if. they're getting negative in the beginning."
706.0,Provider,"yeah but that doesn't necessarily mean you don't have it, though, because what they're finding is that people sometimes aren't subsiding and then they'll go back and get like retested and then they test positive. Right yeah so. went and was tested and he came back negative, but he had, like all the symptoms and the doctor said we're just going to treat you like you have it, because in three days it could come back that you're passive so we'll just treat you like that you know quarantine blah blah blah so."
6229.0,Patient,You know they gave me they gave me like a cough suppress it like a cough syrup so that was it.
706.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah it's viral they can't really do much so well that's not good that you're not feeling well i'm looks like what we need to do today is your bps because we never actually got that completed. Okay, so."
6229.0,Patient,it's just a bunch of questions.
706.0,Provider,"it's background on you for. Treatment purposes. So you've been with braveheart for a while now, but what brought you to write heart."
6229.0,Patient,"Well, I had had my first kid and they prescribed me percocet and I was like Okay, you know I, and I would totally. I used to be totally against me up and then. It started to make me feel good I started to you know it's almost as if I started to maybe focus, I have, I definitely have anxiety, but I don't treat my anxiety and I think that is that's where my downfall is. And then I just wasn't able to get them so, then I ended up getting with someone he did suboxone I started off taking like you know little pieces and then it just progressed from there. So I really it's just gone from pills, you know to suboxone, which is still a pill, but I have never been like a full fledge you know I am an addict but I mean I I haven't done heroin or anything."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm so.
6229.0,Patient,No doesn't make me any better than anybody.
706.0,Provider,anyways but um when you said that they gave it to you when you had your son um did you have like a C section or something that they gave it to you.
6229.0,Patient,"I didn't. I didn't um. He gave me one give me one, and then I you know I kind of milked it a little bit, and I was like Okay, you know, let me get another and then. I one of my friends was like Oh well, I can get those all the time and I just it was a downward spiral, I mean I just kept my item by item, until I couldn't anymore."
706.0,Provider,"i'm pretty terrible when you giving birth, they give you percocet because. yeah um it's definitely not needed, I mean i'm open and tylenol alternating is just as good, and it has obviously no side effects of you know, becoming dependent on it so. But. that's."
6229.0,Patient,"I was in complete denial about it, I mean. I. I still to this day hide everything from my mom or you know I haven't I haven't been very open at all so that's why i'm kind of quiet and group and i'm kind of reserved, because I feel like i'm still on the stage to where i'm like Well, I can admit it on here, so you guys but. i'm worried about what everyone else thinks."
706.0,Provider,"So that's a pretty common thing there's a lot of guilt and shame that goes along with becoming dependent on any kind of a substance. And you have to do everything in your own time, but the one thing I do tell all my patients is that until you come head to head with what happened and a very open about it and don't hide it anymore. that's when you have the power back, but as long as you're still hiding it that substance has power over you."
6229.0,Patient,"I feel like i've you know i'm my mom's youngest child and i'm the only girl. And i've seen her you know she struggled with it long ago, you know when she was pregnant with me and she takes pride in the fact that she was able to. To overcome everything and i've always taken pride in being her child that that was more level headed than the other two mm hmm. it's it's almost as if I have to put on a full facade or i'm acting like someone that i'm not and it's getting. So much."
706.0,Provider,in the way of you have a disease and you treated your disease. So. we'll shouldn't look down on you for that if you had a disease and you were just letting it run rampant that's different because really well why aren't you trying to do anything to help it.
6229.0,Patient,"Right, but you."
706.0,Provider,"Have a disease and you're treating your disease you're doing exactly what you need to do for the best quality of life that you can have um and so that's that's the difference between choosing to be that choosing. An addict is is different than having a substance use disorder, so people call themselves addicts addicts are the people that aren't getting help. addicts other people that are just living that life, they still have a substance use disorder, but they're not actively treating it now, when you have a substance use disorder and you're actively treating it that's different because now you are medicating your disease."
6229.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,To get it into remission. So.
6229.0,Patient,"The box on is definitely. it's helped me in a lot of ways, I mean, as far as you know, I don't feel like i'm scrambling around and wondered, where I find my next pill or. But i'd be lying if I said that I didn't have some sort of shame, you know, like that comes with it it's like well."
706.0,Provider,Yes.
6229.0,Patient,"or no, I feel I feel like i'm doing good, but I want to do better, I want better for sure absolutely."
706.0,Provider,So um is that the only time that you've ever had any issues with substance use did you drink or use any other drugs at all.
6229.0,Patient,"um when I was a teenager I used to you know I used to drink all the time i've done cocaine before. actually used to do it a lot, you know when I was like 1718 years old, but no not really I haven't. Luckily yeah."
706.0,Provider,So you didn't have.
6229.0,Patient,too far down the path.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm so you used it more I guess recreationally there really wasn't a dependence on it.
6229.0,Patient,"yeah until I started to have kids so I always go back to the you know, to the fact that. You know them prescribing percocet for all three of my kids just was bad for me uh huh that's."
706.0,Provider,"I mean that's the difference, though, where you're at more i'm if i'm an iowa and i'm and they don't even when you have a C section they don't even give you a percocet than unless."
6229.0,Patient,"Either pick. unbearable I doctor I have a pretty well known, Dr around here. I honestly i've i've had the same doctor, since I was like 15 years old, so i've been seeing him for years and years and years and. Like he's he's probably one of the only doctors in Ohio that actually prescribe like. The stuff that people take for losing weight out of packs or. yeah he's like one of the only doctors around here that will prescribe that or. I don't know I don't wanna I don't want to call it shady. But I feel like if you say that you're sick or that. he's easily taken advantage of I feel like uh huh."
706.0,Provider,"And he might have ulterior motives to I mean we don't know I don't know about that ad packs or whatever that weight loss drivers I don't know about that, but i'm sure it's probably something like the. phentermine or whatever that was out like a long time ago that was helping people with weight loss. But like with any any drug that you take you have to work with it, whether it be. You have to change the way that you think whether you have like a weight loss drug that you're taking you still have to change your lifestyle he stopped to. eat better ice exercise. was as easy as popping a pill everybody would do it."
6229.0,Patient,"Right well it used to be that you know people in Ohio we're traveling to Kentucky to get out of pets. And I feel like he's the only provider in Ohio which i'm sure that you have to like model, you know, like take a little bit out of time and then he'll stop you, and then you know it's got to be legal somehow but."
706.0,Provider,i've never even heard of it.
6229.0,Patient,I don't know if it's like an Ohio thing but it's really popular around here it's what everybody taking huh.
706.0,Provider,"If it's a miracle drug and you don't have to use anything with it then probably not good, it probably not good for you probably will have adverse effects on your heart eventually."
6229.0,Patient,"yeah I I refused it so. I was like well, I was like I don't want my body to melt like butter anyways so."
706.0,Provider,"Well yeah and if you're a very large person and you lose. muscle. You know yeah I don't know. How the people that are taking it like how large they are but typically to get a weight loss drug, you have to have a certain level of. Like BMI, it has to be so high, before you can."
6229.0,Patient,Even qualify for it. Typically.
706.0,Provider,"doesn't pay for it unless there's significant health issues, and if you lose all that weight fast and you'd be somebody that's very large that loses weight super fast and they're not building any muscle or anything like that you're gonna have a lot of hanging skin you're going to have. you're actually worse about yourself when it's all said and done, because you didn't do it the right way and then you're going to want to have plastic surgery because you're going to want to get rid of all the skin, and I mean it's just much better to do it the right way um but."
6229.0,Patient,My mom always says that fat don't crack.
706.0,Provider,"So um so really but, though, through your history there hasn't been really any kind of a dependence until you started taking opioids after you had your children."
6229.0,Patient,And then it yet kind of.
706.0,Provider,So I wouldn't. You know drinking as a teenager experimenting with some drugs early in late in your teens early in your 20s not that uncommon but it's not something that.
6229.0,Patient,wreck with you.
706.0,Provider,um do you currently drink or do anything like that.
6229.0,Patient,"You know now when I drink I get super sick, so no."
706.0,Provider,yeah it's probably due to the medication.
6229.0,Patient,doesn't play I yeah it'll I can take one drink a beer and either have to throw up or use the restroom or it's just not a fun time for me.
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it doesn't play well with others, and I think that. that's one of those I guess side effects that's actually a benefit because you do have people that have alcohol use disorders, also in addition to an opioid use disorder and it kind of deters them from using either so. That i'm actually you know, sometimes as a benefit um how many years, would you say that you have had a substance use disorder."
6229.0,Patient,"Well, my daughter is seven so without me here yeah."
706.0,Provider,"And during that seven years, did you have any periods of like sobriety where you weren't taking anything."
6229.0,Patient,i'm. not really.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
6229.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean, but if it if it wasn't a pill, you know I smoke some weed or or drink or. it's always chasing this this. This feeling, you know yeah then we do it, you feel like crap anyway so you're like."
706.0,Provider,"you're chasing the euphoric feeling. Basically, that that mine altering feeling that feeling of like being numb or you know, having euphoria or whatever it may be. Just not feeling what you want, that what you're supposed to be feeling and not rest ultimately what substances do they make you feel they help you not to feel the things you should be feeling, whether it be physical pain emotional pain, whatever it may be. that's just that's what they do, but that also causes issues, obviously, because then, when you become sober all those things are still there, and now you have to deal with them and it's a lot."
6229.0,Patient,easier to go with them when you're sober.
706.0,Provider,So. What about. What was that.
6229.0,Patient,I said it's it's it's just insane um I feel a lot of it is. I don't know if you've ever been to Ohio but the area that i'm from. it's like everyone. People that you wouldn't even think.
706.0,Provider,"yeah. Ohio is the state that I know of that has the most. Like a book about it, or something talks about how the doctors there and the drug cartels like. kind of like made a deal yeah it's very it's very sad. it's very sad. that's why we have."
6229.0,Patient,A higher it's weird cuz you know that there's a sense of normal out there mm hmm but where you're from is is not normal.
706.0,Provider,This is.
6229.0,Patient,This isn't supposed to be how life. Is no.
706.0,Provider,"No and it's very prevalent out there, I mean we have several Ohio groups, you know there's not just one, there are several."
6229.0,Patient,"You know I never. I never thought when I had kids that i'd be like driving by a place or explaining why. People were sleeping sitting up or. yeah you. can't go anywhere and not see it, so you have to. You have to just shake your head or her you have around here that won't help, but they will record it and post it online like."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well and you don't want to normalize it for the kids either, because then they just think that that's okay. You definitely want to have that very upfront conversation of you know they're nodding out because they're using such and such."
6229.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"it'll eventually kill them, you know, like and it's scary that you have to talk to your kids like that, but you really do because there's so much stuff on social media that glamorizes things that."
6229.0,Patient,Absolutely.
706.0,Provider,"Well, it makes it really difficult to."
6229.0,Patient,And in my area of the. there's so many people that have died from. it's been all that's really big around here. But yeah.
706.0,Provider,"They put fentanyl and everything. Not just heroin they put it in xanax pills they put it, and cocaine they put it in we they put it in just about anything over here."
6229.0,Patient,"I know, and you can't I mean it's even if you did want to go do something out of the box, you can even try it even if you did know there's a scene there's machines that you can press pills and stamp make it look like the real thing and yeah there's no dead."
706.0,Provider,yeah we actually have a harm reduction coalition here in iowa that. gives out kits to test for final on pill other drugs yeah that's harm reduction if you're going to use you've already made that choice you're going to use we're just trying. To make sure you don't die from it from using one time. wow yeah.
6229.0,Patient,"You know, I think that would be something that would be helpful helpful for people around here, but I don't really know where those resources come from or if they want to stop it anyways so."
706.0,Provider,"it's definitely a nonprofit and I don't even know necessarily where it came from, but iowa is very much a harm reduction type state. I have a very much harm reduction type philosophy, you know do do the least amount of harm to yourself, as you can you know."
6229.0,Patient,Right and so.
706.0,Provider,"It definitely makes a difference, looking at from that perspective, and then the strength perspective as well you know they you know just because you have maybe you have like three months in recovery, and you have a slip up I, I believe."
6229.0,Patient,Might.
706.0,Provider,"lose that three months because you still have that three months, as long as you get back on your track and keep on going that's a bump in the road so. It just depends on the philosophies that people have in treatment. Right so. So beside your substance use. As far as Is this the only treatment program that you've been in have you been to like a detox anything like that."
6229.0,Patient,"um. No, I have not. I haven't attempted um. i've done like some counseling sessions, but that's nothing, as you know, as far as detox goes. On and. Talk to someone."
706.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, what about like an A or a meetings."
6229.0,Patient,I have not.
706.0,Provider,"um. What about any mental health diagnosis, I know that you had mentioned anxiety."
6229.0,Patient,So my first time sitting down with this lady she could you know everything that just was explaining she was like well you know you definitely have anxiety. And then I never went back. scared. It literally scared the heck out of me I was like um.
706.0,Provider,"Well, she is psychiatrist. Yes, okay. So um. I would say that. I mean you probably do have anxiety, I mean to be quite honest, everybody. Has a wall of anxiety."
6229.0,Patient,"It just had the older that I get the more that I don't want to be. My boyfriend hates this about me, but I just don't like to be around people anymore. i'm fed up with everyone or."
706.0,Provider,You feel.
6229.0,Patient,feeling like a big ball of anger and i'm not enjoyable to be around like.
706.0,Provider,"So tell me what that looks like is it that you are constantly questioning people like are they talking about you are you, you know that kind of thing is it more so that you're just edgy all the time, and you just feel at any moment, you could snap."
6229.0,Patient,it's both.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. it's probably might be a good idea, because doctors, is it Dr sal that you see."
6229.0,Patient,"No, I see I say accrues."
706.0,Provider,Isaiah okay i'm getting confused because it has been out for so long that Dr song has been filling in so now the only. meshing together offer.
6229.0,Patient,She did offer. To take me under her little wing so she said that we would talk about it or she would talk about it with Isaiah. But I don't mind either way I like I like them both so.
706.0,Provider,But you definitely probably want to try something for anxiety and anxiety medication is could be something as simple as ideas around that you take every day that it just.
6229.0,Patient,"builds my mom. My mom actually takes anxiety medicine and she has for since she was a teenager I forget what it's called, but I know it's one of the more popular names, but she lives, I mean there's not a."
706.0,Provider,"lot of people there's a lot of people that need it, you know. We typically don't give up lenses because obviously there's there's something you can form a dependence on as well, but there's a RAD anxiety medications."
6229.0,Patient,"Out there and that's not what it's called that she's on, I want to say it starts with a Z but maybe i'm wrong."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well and there's I mean there's just a lot of them out there, so though you know they can talk to you about what the options are but that might definitely help you with that edgy kind of you know snappy feeling that you have um, so I would."
6229.0,Patient,My boyfriend even tells me he's like you you're so negative i'm just negative anymore it's it's like I don't see the bright side anymore. mm hmm and even if it is something that's good i'm like well what if. What if yeah and he's like you have to stop thinking like that i'm like well.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
6229.0,Patient,When you know that you're getting on your own nerves.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm well think about though the fact that opioids have they have affected your brain so. That friendship affects your frontal lobe your frontal lobe is your ability to make decisions your judgment your impulsivity so you have a hard time processing probably through something so you just automatically go to the to the worst case scenario.
6229.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,Looking through and seeing all sides is very challenging and yet would be something you've always struggled with that could be something that has there's an effect on because of all the years that you used it's hard to say.
6229.0,Patient,"But that's. Something that I definitely have always struggled with. i'm pretty good at going through traumatic things in. playing a poker face and i've been doing it for so many years, you know, taking something from here and putting it all the way back in my head that. it's like I live in fantasy land sometimes like that stuff never even happened just and then you think about it and you're like. Where the hell did this go, you know, like I haven't thought about this in five years, so I am I thinking about it now mm hmm it's like I want, I want to take things and lock it in a box and make it go away forever mm hmm and all that it's doing is building the boxes. And now. You know I just turned 26 years old, and I feel like I have nothing to show for it and. i'm pissed off at myself."
706.0,Provider,"is a difference between fairly quickly within you know, a couple weeks to a month, you should feel that difference, and so I would definitely have that conversation with Dr sal or Isaiah or whomever."
6229.0,Patient,"yeah i'm definitely open to. To getting my mental health under control i'm my biological dad he is actually he's like 55 now but he's in a home, and he has paranoid schizophrenia, and I don't want to wake up one day and. I don't want to wake up one day or my kids wake up, one day, and remember me as the angry mom you know."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm no absolutely yep absolutely.
6229.0,Patient,"And I cared about everything anymore, I mean my kids are river near water and i'm like, no, no, no, no. I don't want to be like that, for them, but I also want them to understand that i'm coming from. A good place, but I feel like i'm also taking from them too mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no that's completely understandable um so you really don't have a history of any kind of mental health treatment you're just starting to kind of explore that now. Yes, Okay, and what about a history of suicidal ideation."
6229.0,Patient,No i'm.
706.0,Provider,So history of homicidal ideation Have you ever wanted to hurt other people.
6229.0,Patient,yeah but not. Not like I want to kill you way now yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Okay gotcha um What about self injurious behaviors did you ever burn anything like that. Okay, and you've not taken any kind of psychiatric medications as of yet."
6229.0,Patient,"One time my doctor prescribed me. An antidepressant I don't remember the name I took it for two days felt like shit and stop taking it Okay, so no not really. Okay, and that was postpartum."
706.0,Provider,"Okay postpartum depression typically they give you Prozac for postpartum depression, but I mean it could have been something different."
6229.0,Patient,I don't remember the name but that might have been it.
706.0,Provider,"So the medical medications when you first start taking them, you have to give them at least a two week period to even start work. Because typically they have half lives so typically you know medication is 100% into your system, but by 30 days it's built up, and then, if you take it for so long and then let's say you miss a few days you don't feel like a huge difference right away because there's that half life. But you really any of those medications you want to really try and take consistently the same time, every day, you know, and so it builds in your system, so you have that consistency."
6229.0,Patient,"that's when medication, with the best. Okay."
706.0,Provider,So just just for two days it really wasn't doing anything so if you felt crappy it's just because you felt crappy it wasn't the.
6229.0,Patient,Case yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So, like."
6229.0,Patient,I feel like I needed something to blame it on or that I didn't want to eat on something else.
706.0,Provider,"You know yeah no, I understand that so like if it's a stomach upset or you know something like that that can be from the medication, because you could be having an adverse effect, but if you just overall just don't. Just feel crappy like before you even took it let's just because it hasn't started working at because it's not a miracle, you know, and you don't just pop in and be like oh and it's not happy pills like like."
6229.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,Right so. i'm.
6229.0,Patient,pretty much takes like the edge off and just. Know levels.
706.0,Provider,"Depending on what your diagnosis, so if you if you have you may have anxiety and depression and so maybe you need to take something for Depression and anxiety because Depression and anxiety are very similar and they have very similar symptoms. You know, extreme you know, like major depressive is very different, I mean because you get really, really low where you don't want to get out of bed things like that, but just a diagnosis of. Depression and generalized anxiety those two a lot of times have very similar symptoms, so a lot of times they're diagnosed together and then they're also treated together, so you might get like an Anti anxiety that also has you know, an antidepressant piece of it as well."
6229.0,Patient,But you know.
706.0,Provider,"A lot of people will take like Prozac and view sperone together because one's an antidepressant one's more of an anti anxiety, with a little."
6229.0,Patient,marker Prozac is what my mom takes.
706.0,Provider,yeah so those two together sometimes are perfect and they just kind of level you out you're like you know what I know feel like I want to rip people's heads off anymore that's awesome.
6229.0,Patient,yeah I definitely meet them.
706.0,Provider,"So. That would definitely be a good stuff in your treatment. So you talked about your mom she has a mental health stuff he said some anxiety some depression. yeah and then you talked about your dad and he had schizophrenia. Yes, um is there any other mental health issues within your family."
6229.0,Patient,"I mean there's a long line of mental health on both sides. Okay we're talking grandmas moms of grandmas. Okay, so."
706.0,Provider,there's a lot there in your within your within your family.
6229.0,Patient,"And, and what I said about you know growing up with you know just never remembering your mom being happy and stuff my mom has said that to me before. Not saying hey I don't want you to be that person, but hey my mother was this to me don't be this person. yeah yeah."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and with their being on both sides long lines of mental health that typically is something that can be hereditary so you definitely want to treat it sooner rather than later."
6229.0,Patient,"And both of my brothers are on antidepressants now to as of this year. I don't know if it's like the times that is hitting us so hard or. For for all getting to that age to where we're like. To where we're like fed up and it's hey we do something about it, are we living on happy life now."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and for you, I mean for seven years, you are taking something to alter you know that altered you so you don't even know how you really feel because you were altered all the time. Right, you know um, but it could be, I mean in the last year and a half the the mental health. of people have declined, I mean because we weren't a pandemic and people were locked up at home with people they may or may not have liked you know, like you, you love your husband you love your kids love them, but you can be around them 24 seven for like eight months. You know. it's just it's crazy."
6229.0,Patient,"I feel like what what i'm lacking anymore is. My purpose, I just want to know what i'm doing, and when i'm going to do it and how i'm going to do it. But my mind. Sets me back, I mean I am my worst I am like my worst enemy."
706.0,Provider,"So that comes from a lot of that anxiety depression like because, because the way that you think is altered. So I mean one of those and that's that's a really, really good thing to tackle in therapy is what are your goals, how do you achieve those those goals and then the steps to get there. Right you're going to get there, if you don't start and the starting part, especially for people that have high anxiety is the worst part it's just like taking that first step because it's like well what if I fail."
6229.0,Patient,What if it doesn't work right.
706.0,Provider,What if I can't do that so we're just going to wash all that away and come up with a plan so that will be sounds like that needs to be one of life and major goals in therapy for you is to find your purpose and then get a plan to get you there.
6229.0,Patient,You ain't you know what i'm glad that you said that because I feel like what I do to myself is i'm like well if I just keep it bad then it's just bad.
706.0,Provider,"Well yeah then, then you have no accountability for it it's like well it's. Right, but if you try something and then you fail, then you have to take accountability and you failed. Right, a lot of people because of that will set themselves up for failure that's where the plan comes in, because you're not going to go from you know, being a couch potato, for instance, to running a marathon. And bright, they just it just isn't possible it's the same thing, like you, can't go from having everything kind of in your life uprooted to having this like perfect little happy picket fence. over here, it takes time and it takes work and it takes planning to get there."
6229.0,Patient,"You know, and I do the same thing, like even with even with my dating history, I mean i've tried I don't even know how I found my two the two babies fathers that I have but I couldn't have picked a worse option. Seriously, I don't know why I felt the need that I needed to fix somebody or. or it's just like well they're bad so all that I can expect is bad and then i'm unhappy because it's bad."
706.0,Provider,"set the bar low That way, you know. You can't fail in that either."
6229.0,Patient,"Because I I truly don't know how I would react to somebody who truly left me, and I know that that is a messed up thought, but it's how I feel."
706.0,Provider,"I think that has a lot to do with self esteem, if I was to guess, I would say your self esteem, is very low."
6229.0,Patient,"Oh yeah very much so now, I used to. I used to be literally a bombshell when I started having kids and then I started dating me stupid men and I don't know I I lost myself somewhere."
706.0,Provider,yeah well and even even when you were saying like I used to be a bombshell you may have had still low self esteem you just didn't realize that you. were so focused on external rather than internal.
6229.0,Patient,"yeah. it's been a long, long time."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm so um. So what substance use any substance use within your family on either side.
6229.0,Patient,um. My dad was addicted to speed i'm not too sure specifically what but. I know that he's ruined his life chasing a high so. well.
706.0,Provider,"He Well he has schizophrenia which can either could have he could have been self medicating or it could have damaged his brain and then exacerbated the symptoms, he already had it's hard today."
6229.0,Patient,"He not a whole ride to play like professional baseball stuff like that, and he ruined it, I mean he ruined it for drugs and then he started doing crazy stuff because of drugs and then."
706.0,Provider,"it's just hard to say you know, did the chicken before the egg the egg come before the chicken and."
6229.0,Patient,"I found out that he was my dad and the weirdest way so. My brothers, I have two older brothers. My mom told me that she was testing me for lead in the water, one day, and I don't know if you know what that is but it's like a it's a swab that they. fit you know, then you send it in, and it says hey blah blah blah, you have led my mom was like yeah I did it I don't have it, but the school wants to make sure blah blah blah mm hmm it actually was a DNA test. Okay. I had garden 13 years. thinking that I have the same data as my brothers, you know the weird thing is, I actually look like him."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6229.0,Patient,"Still in my life, I still call him dad."
706.0,Provider,But it's there's nothing wrong with that.
6229.0,Patient,"You know my mom she I don't feel like she takes really accountability for that, but that's really when everything just started to. just get weird and go South for me."
706.0,Provider,"Well here's your identity is questioned at that point, and at that young of an age or question who you are and where you belong that's huge."
6229.0,Patient,"And literally still to this day, my mom says, well, I had no clue. I didn't you know he took her to court because he wanted to get you know, like visitation and his girlfriend at the time was like hey you know Sierra has green eyes and you know she short stubby and none of your other kids are, and you know just pointing out differences in us and. My mom still swears up and down that she didn't know but I don't know how you don't know you know."
706.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's a challenging thing you know, but I mean like I said questioning like your identity, who you are where you belong all of those things at a young age can definitely cause some people in your life um. So how is your relationship with your family now."
6229.0,Patient,"um. So I talked to not my biological dad but. dad mm hmm. it's okay he's pretty distant, it has to be more me reaching out than anything i'm very close to his wife, though she lives, like a block away she helps me with anything and everything that I need."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so mom and dad are divorced and dad's remarried."
6229.0,Patient,yeah they they were never married.
706.0,Provider,"Oh, they were never made okay. Okay."
6229.0,Patient,"She actually she had my brothers when she was 13 and 14 so it's a long line of gosh yeah so she was 13 and 14 she was pregnant when she was 12 had Kevin at 13 had Calvin and then five years later, got pregnant with me and my dad at the time was 19. You know knew better had no business being with someone that young mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,wow that's quite that is a family history.
6229.0,Patient,it's a Jerry Springer story. i've told people my whole life i'm like you don't even want to know about me I got I got some issues.
706.0,Provider,um. Medical stuff is there anything major medical in your family.
6229.0,Patient,"Yes, cancer runs in my family. My mom has diabetes. I have pre hypertension. it's really about it, like my grandparents on my dad's side. diabetic one died of a heart attack. that's about it i'm actually have some issues going on with myself right now. I have they found like pre cancerous cells."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6229.0,Patient,"And I just got elite surgery done not too long ago to like take them out, and then I go for a follow up here in two weeks to see. How it's been progressing and stuff like that, but not only do they tell me that, but they said that I have a strain of like HPV that causes cervical cancer so."
706.0,Provider,yeah the high risk yeah.
6229.0,Patient,"You would think that I would be jumping on the gun, but it terrifies me so much that i'm like I don't care. And I pushed it off for years and then I went in and they were like well, they said you're literally the last stage before you have cancer like you should probably be taking this serious and yeah."
706.0,Provider,"Well, you did that whole if I don't think about it it'll go away. i'm. With cancer it doesn't work that way."
6229.0,Patient,"it's literally that train of thought is not working for me. No, no aspect of my life doesn't work."
706.0,Provider,"So the best way to say is, if you keep doing the same thing over and over and you get the same result it's time to make a change."
6229.0,Patient,yeah absolutely.
706.0,Provider,So.
6229.0,Patient,I feel like that's why i'm walking around so angry lately it's just. And then I i'm with someone who is just. Not the person for me.
706.0,Provider,"So if you are with somebody and you're not happy, and especially if it's a toxic relationship, the best thing that you can do for you. is to decide hey are we going Is this something that can be worked on, to make it so it is healthy, or is it something that I need to cut my losses and go, because you before you can be happy with anybody else you have to be happy with you."
6229.0,Patient,that's why.
706.0,Provider,"out these guys that aren't right for you, that don't treat you well all of these things, because you feel that way about yourself."
6229.0,Patient,"Yes, like a whole bunch of kids mothers and like seven kids. mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,"So one more thing to work on in therapy is self esteem and realizing what you're worth as and then not rounding those edges, just because you don't want to be alone."
6229.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,have to be able to be happy alone with yourself before you can be happy with somebody else.
6229.0,Patient,"yeah and I totally I totally agree with that, but now, here I am three years in. I have a child, with him and it's like."
706.0,Provider,that's what we call codependency.
6229.0,Patient,yeah it's insane.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
6229.0,Patient,"cuz I went I went from one horrible option to a more horrible option, though. yeah."
706.0,Provider,"So, then, we just see figure out why, why do you do that now another thing that therapy will will dig into is figuring out why you do those things um so are you currently living with the boyfriend then. Yes, okay and. You guys live in Ohio. Yes, okay um in your childhood, did you have any experiences of any abuse, sexual physical verbal."
6229.0,Patient,"Well, definitely verbal for sure. You know, as far as the sexual abuse goes, I remember. And this is again, you know when things happen and I locked away in the back of my head, I remember telling my grandma that you know, I was being touched inappropriately blah blah blah, and she was like no you're not like. Just completely blew it off."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6229.0,Patient,"In a sense, I blew it off and I forgot about it but. Really growing up, I remember being I remember, being a sexual kid like I remember knowing about sex early I remember craving sex, I remember, being a teenager and sleeping with different guys and I know that that sounds horrible but."
706.0,Provider,"No, because you were searching for unconditional love morning on lightly, because you had. You didn't have a dad I mean there's so many there's like so many different components like I said, these are all things. That you should have been in therapy for years ago but it's good that you're doing it now, because once these things are sorted out once you talk about all of these things. You are going to feel like this huge weight just lifted off your shoulders and you're going to be able to figure out who Sierra is then."
6229.0,Patient,yeah I need to because I don't remember.
706.0,Provider,"yeah who you are, what do you want, what are your goals you know all of those things um. You know, and then your as everything changes you're going to start being the person that you want to be, you know. yeah physically mentally spiritually everything as a whole person. And that's what you know you need to do and that's what your kids deserve because those kids you know they look up to you and depend on you for everything and so. When you say I don't want to be this person anymore that's great because they probably are having those thoughts as and this isn't really my mom like this isn't really how my mom is."
6229.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"You know, and so you know, making those changes is going to be. Very you know."
6229.0,Patient,"It hopefully if I change it from here on out, you know, out of when is seven it's like mm hmm is she got to remember you know."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and you also don't want your kids thinking that the kind of relationship that you have with your boyfriend is a healthy relationship and that's the norm, because then they're going to grow up and they're going to go find unhealthy relationships. And jump into them and think that that's Okay, because that's all they saw."
6229.0,Patient,"Well, not only do I not like him, but he doesn't like me either you know so it's like."
706.0,Provider,that's codependency. it's like I hate you don't leave me.
6229.0,Patient,Literally.
706.0,Provider,yep yep.
6229.0,Patient,But I want to get to the point to where i'm like go literally just go.
706.0,Provider,"yeah there's actually a book called that I hate you don't leave me. Really talks about codependency as well as like borderline personality which you might have a certain piece of that too, like I said, you really need to have a psych evaluation done to be truly diagnosed with everything that's going on with you, so that it can be properly treated. Right um so possible sexual abuse definitely verbal abuse which would explain low self esteem from a young age."
6229.0,Patient,"Oh no I. I have i'm really close to my mom I i've always. I talked to her literally every single day, but my mom is very. Toxic for my mental health. Okay, instead of being supportive she she'll say everything under the sun. yeah everything that's negative and then it'll be well i'm just you know, trying to give you tough love or whatever, but that does not work with me, I completely I shut down instead of that's not encouraging to me. I don't. You know, instead of being like hey I feel like you're doing things wrong should be like well you're a piece of shit mom and you're you're this and you're this and blah blah blah blah blah."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and I think that, as you figure out. What your your needs are what your goals are the things that you want to change you'll also going to figure out ways of communicating that that's not okay to your mom."
6229.0,Patient,And right appropriate.
706.0,Provider,"way that's you know and it's not that you can't have a relationship with your mom, but you have the right to be like you know mom i'm telling you this because i'm looking for support and you're really making me feel worse, so I really don't want to talk about this with you anymore."
6229.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,And being and being okay to walk away.
6229.0,Patient,"But she's, to the point to where she doesn't want to talk about it at all."
706.0,Provider,anymore.
6229.0,Patient,"So she's kind of done the same thing with me, but I could I could go on for days and tell her all the things that I think about her or all the wrong things that she did when I was a child, but what is the point yeah."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and you need them that's that's what therapy for you need to process all that and therapy processing it with her is one thing, but it's but especially if she isn't isn't going to be open to those conversations processing. That they're getting and getting kind of some closure that way for you is really important, because right those emotions come out and directly to your mom because you haven't processed them yeah."
6229.0,Patient,"She does she doesn't understand what it feels like to be 16 years old skipping school and stuff but you're letting me because your boyfriend doesn't want me and my brother, to be there, you know so us. You know him having to almost raise me like she she doesn't get how angry, I am at her mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,"yep, and these are all things that you need to kind of process through these are all things that have been sitting inside you just festering for years and years and years and that's why, when you took something that made you feel good you're like oh my gosh all that just went away."
6229.0,Patient,This is the green sheet.
706.0,Provider,For her.
6229.0,Patient,She Let me move out when I was 16 you know she was done raising kids she was like to the age to where she was like okay i've been raising kids since I was 13 so go on and do your thing but. result that I didn't graduate high school I didn't like uh huh I don't know I just needed her to be a different person.
706.0,Provider,"Did you get your ged. I did it so that might be one of those short term goals is getting your ged because that's fairly easy to do, and that will also make you feel a lot better about yourself."
6229.0,Patient,Open up your door through.
706.0,Provider,"Employment potentially could go to school, if you had any desire to go back to school, a ged can get you into college."
6229.0,Patient,I definitely want to do that for sure.
706.0,Provider,um yeah so I mean those things right there are going to boost your self esteem like instantly because you have accomplished something that you feel like you should have accomplished years ago. Right um are you working currently.
6229.0,Patient,"I am not I do start a new job next week, though it's doing like a home health aide type. So I just turned in the last of my paperwork yesterday so. Sometime next week that will get the ball rolling with orientation okay."
706.0,Provider,So you like working in the health field.
6229.0,Patient,I do yeah okay.
706.0,Provider,So yeah so ged to a two year nursing degree would open up so many doors for you.
6229.0,Patient,Oh yeah absolutely.
706.0,Provider,"So um do you have any legal history any charges or anything from like the gold stuff drugs anything like that. No Okay, so no legal history at all."
6229.0,Patient,"No, I don't have any felonies nothing."
706.0,Provider,"Great great so yeah you shouldn't have any issues with getting into the medical field at all, because you don't have any background things. So what do you like to do for you, for like happy self care what makes you happy that you can do for you."
6229.0,Patient,it's been so long that I don't even know.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
6229.0,Patient,"I don't do anything for myself, I feel like if it's not the baby it's my son or it's my daughter or my boyfriend something or mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
6229.0,Patient,"So, think about me anymore yeah."
706.0,Provider,"big thing is self care is needed self care is needed, you need to take time, every day, where you just are like nope self care self care."
6229.0,Patient,I am going and getting my hair done Saturday.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's good and that's self care, you know I have, I have two kids I have a two and a half year old and a 13 year old, so my whole world is all hectic all the time."
6229.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"You know my husband knows, though between work and picking up our son from daycare I go to the gym that's my self care time i'm not giving it up i'm not going to miss it unless it absolutely have to because that's my self care time I go to the gym."
6229.0,Patient,"You have more of more of that for me like I used to go like tanning and stuff and even that gives me time to. You know, and then at the end you're like okay well i'm Brown and I look good and."
706.0,Provider,"feel better about yourself. Absolutely and. Even you're not even though you get artificial vitamin D from a tanning bed that warmth in that light boost your mood because a lot of. Especially during this time of year they lose their vitamin D, because you don't have as much sun time and that can change your mood that's why some people."
6229.0,Patient,Take vitamin D in the winter.
706.0,Provider,To keep that mood up.
6229.0,Patient,So i'm definitely going to look into doing that Saturday as well just. yeah baby right and not only. For myself.
706.0,Provider,"You need to schedule it so. If we friends around, then you know, and if you too, I mean. You you're the only two that can decide if you need to stay together you guys need to separate from you know because that's better than you need to separate but. Right I. need to tap into your natural supports like."
6229.0,Patient,"We both we both say that all the time, but then. it's like will say so much hurt pull stuff to each other and then it's like at the end of the day, we're still laying in the same bed or mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,"yeah, but is it healthy."
6229.0,Patient,"it's not healthy, he is. he's cheated, like so many times and I have. I don't know I just I can't forgive that I feel like it's just something that I don't even want to work on forgetting."
706.0,Provider,yeah so you're you're in that hole and hate you don't need me I don't want to be alone so just stay here till I find somebody to take your place. yeah so that's and that's not a healthy way to be you need to be able to say I deserve better than this kick them to the curb and work on you.
6229.0,Patient,"Right that's exactly what I need to do more and I have a tad bit of I don't want to be with you, but I don't want them to have you either."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm well yeah because what if he's better with them, what if he becomes the guy that you always wanted him to be but it's with them, then you're sitting back here watching."
6229.0,Patient,"him before. The people that he always goes back to are the people that he has kids. So I don't think that their relationships are any better, the only difference between me and them is. There more passive than I am they're more like hey you can use my car and you can sleep with whoever as long as you're coming home and i'm not that person."
706.0,Provider,"don't be that person if he wants to be that person, let him go back and be that person with them."
6229.0,Patient,"And he doesn't even get how disrespectful most of the stuff is like, for instance, last week, he needed gas money or we were going to a son's football game well the first person that he called you know, to get help to go there was. His kids his mom mm hmm Joe is claims oh I hate you and blah blah blah but she's always there for him at the drop of a dime."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
6229.0,Patient,it's odd to me.
706.0,Provider,"Yes, no, I mean. I think you just have to make the decision, what are you going to do what is going to be best for you for your kids and then make a plan and stick with that."
6229.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
706.0,Provider,"that's going to help with their self esteem issues sounds like your stress levels are really high because you've got all this stuff going on. You know, major stressor is going on, you know you've got the relationship that's not working that's not healthy you've got some mental health stuff that's not addressed you've got. stuff with your mom that weighs on you, because that communications not there, and those are all things to work on and it sounds like you wanted to start working on you to you know, like you know, like feeling better about yourself just how you look it sounds like you're not happy with. And so you know and also it sounds like inside you're not happy with who you are so you know all of those things are things that can be changed. Over time, but if you put yourself in a in a constant state of i'm not good enough, I don't deserve any better I can't get any better all of that, then that's not going to change because you're just staying in the same place you're basically running. Around the wheel going nowhere. Right so um. So yeah I mean those are all things that therapy will help with because they just help you examine all of those areas. You know and and make those changes, you know little bit at a time, but eventually all the little changes add up to big changes."
6229.0,Patient,I agree so.
706.0,Provider,"Well, we got through the bps so that's good we finally got that done um do you have any questions for me."
6229.0,Patient,"I don't besides a doctor so only gave me. A prescription until today, is there any way that someone can send her a message or."
706.0,Provider,"um it's probably be to make sure you did your bps because you've missed so many appointments to do. So I did messaged her and let her know that you did come to your bps. Okay um she will be you know, taking care of that but that's what we're doing because it's so important to get the therapy piece of treatment, as you can tell today there's so much that you need to work on and talk about yeah."
6229.0,Patient,"I mean, I even feel better than now that I even talked about."
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
6229.0,Patient,But I feel a little bit of weight is like.
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm and you'll feel that more and more and that's why it's so important to get into that to go to therapy and talk about those things, because you started using for a reason you have to figure out what that reason is before you can say to yourself i'm never going to do it again. Right, you know, like I don't want that anymore, because right now, if something traumatic happened in your world, the first thing you're going to do is go back to what you know that's comforting because you don't have any other tools to use."
6229.0,Patient,"Now, do I have to talk to Isaiah like when he gets back about getting the antidepressants or is that something."
706.0,Provider,"You can talk to Dr sal and see what she says. Okay he's not going to be back until at least beginning of November. So I would say, you know definitely. Talk to Dr song and see."
6229.0,Patient,What she thinks. Now what's the best way to get Ahold of her like schedule an appointment with her or just wait until um.
706.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you can definitely try and schedule a medical appointment with her, I don't know how far she's booked. out, would you uh can go to the BC and they'll be able to help you with that otherwise group on Monday she'll be there."
6229.0,Patient,"Alright, I will definitely do that."
706.0,Provider,"Okay sounds great, so I will see you in group on Monday done."
6229.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
706.0,Provider,you're welcome have a good weekend.
6229.0,Patient,You too.
