8228.0,Patient,"He he plays games, but he played at fortnight and stuff he'll run. stuff like that. But it's always something for some of them to do here. Is."
206.0,Provider,Why. Some of it all depends on the interest and just nurture that interest. things going with you and your medical stuff.
8228.0,Patient,um. that's really good I haven't gotten any. Any new like. was to know like you know how I got go and stuff like that I haven't got any new cases so. i'm good just regular checkups and. Maintaining this stuff already got.

8228.0,Patient,"Oh, I mean. I don't think so."
206.0,Provider,"Not. happy. With the surgery, so how ready they think you are so along with that part."
8228.0,Patient,"i'm waiting for the surgery, but I just feel like like I really don't understand what cigarettes have to do with it like you know I feel like you know when you got something major like that going on hell, you need a cigarette you know the commoners and stuff."
206.0,Provider,"Okay, but i'm sure that may be may cause additional harm a few were to. Have like."
8228.0,Patient,"What they say it was it a the healing process. It makes sense longer. Okay, what I feel like if that's The only problem then irregularly take six weeks and minds is like nine weeks because i'm smoking. hey I should be able to be like i'm the one that's going to have to take the weeks to to heal. it's not like it's going to stop the healing process is going to slow it down which the doctors, you know they know what they know they say what they say I can't explain that to them like that so saying saying hi phil is really irrelevant, but. No, I haven't i'm i'm actually 100% ready to move on with the surgery, the only thing is the cigarettes."
206.0,Provider,And that's the step back for several months now.
8228.0,Patient,"yeah I would say, several."
206.0,Provider,Since we started.
8228.0,Patient,"hey only been in this this this. date for about five months, four months. From like there, how long i've. been in."
206.0,Provider,"we're looking at least oh man i've seen already February, some noise modern February so that's like yeah i'm not i'm not tell you, when you started. But. I know what you send in terms of these ages, because of the healing but sometimes they may not want to take that on our lab if they for that it would could trigger this other issue when it comes to your healing so that's why we why the focus and trying to get to the back. Before the DEMO for you started wow. The start date is. December 2020 so going into a year now. I know they start talking. He was cool so February, but so yeah you've been there for a bit now. For yeah. Pushing towards the sun."
8228.0,Patient,Only thing about that is that that lets me know i've been on probation for a little over a year they're.
206.0,Provider,actually getting close to get off. yeah okay.
8228.0,Patient,"Usually on probation when you do everything you need to do like I got three years but. If ever like I pay all my files and stay out of trouble and do whatever classes, they want me to do. Then I. I could get awesome like a year. Back year something like that. What the stupid cove it is mess him up everything because she told me there's two classes, they want me to do. It ain't like no drug classes like one of them is like a life class. But. I have to do those before I can graduate probation. and doing any classes, right now, because it coven."
206.0,Provider,So damon transition to virtual either. Because most places so anyway doing.
8228.0,Patient,"I don't think so last time I talked to her, which was like. Like three four meetings ago when I when I see which is probably like last month, sometimes she said, they still wasn't taken anybody, but she didn't say men about virtual."
206.0,Provider,"Okay, but then some went What happened was those people that I posed to be off probation to just sit and wait."
8228.0,Patient,"I guess, so I mean. Once your time is up, if you get like, for instance, if I got if I was on three years and I was like a month away but cove it was still a strong. I don't think you know, three years, three years they can't hold me cuz. If they didn't get the class I."
206.0,Provider,don't make sense yeah.
8228.0,Patient,The people that's ready to get off of Dame done it they you know.
206.0,Provider,Because he wasn't available to them.
8228.0,Patient,All right.
206.0,Provider,Why. At least we have something to look forward so if you continue with all your. Maintaining the probation and making sure you're not testing positive for anything.
8228.0,Patient,"And I plan to. have made it on probation once before, so."
206.0,Provider,"And why would keep you out of going back into probation from now on, once this is all."
8228.0,Patient,Going back in like getting in trouble again.
206.0,Provider,yeah Why would prevent you from getting into that type of situation again.
8228.0,Patient,there's a lot of things like starting by not not doing the certain stuff that I was doing.
206.0,Provider,"So, was that probation was a job later."
8228.0,Patient,"You know it. Where I guess is everywhere, you know, everybody got certain situations, but you know, once the case is done and overweight. They like to not talk about it because, like when I was. Getting sentence and I told the judge, I was like you know, a what did I say I said uh. I said something like honestly. I shouldn't even have that or something they railroaded me something, and he was like what do you want to plead not guilty and I was like no because I already got the deal on the table and I already accepted the deal. Like midway through my case I had one case and then midway through my case they tried to go another case. Right, but I really couldn't fight it, because then the other Kate the initial case that I was on. They would have tried to bring somebody else into it. which I had already got the other person off, so I wasn't trying to bring them back into it. So I really feel like I got railroaded because my lawyer told me I couldn't beat the. case, but if I beat the case, they would have been mad, and they would have came back after where the person is my mom dad came back after my mom. Oh."
206.0,Provider,I see you're trying to protect her in that sense. Right and get involved with that.
8228.0,Patient,"Oh me, you know, even if they came back and got her. They will it. And then initially dropping later when my mom she's been through a lot changed in like in church or that."
206.0,Provider,And the last.
8228.0,Patient,"One is for her face to be plastered on that Facebook stuff for know all the church people gossiping about her and all that. thing I want, so I just took it on the chin and. They would have had to do it was my fault for involvement her anyway."
206.0,Provider,"So you took down responsibility for your part in that situation. Right, so how did mountain about you, accepting that part, even though you pull up for the in involved in a way."
8228.0,Patient,"mom is definitely a writer, and she sometimes she loves us too much. You know I. I don't really know because at the end of the day, you do whatever for your kids and my mom done did two years in jail, she changed her life order. Talk about the last thing she want to do is go back to prison but that day she was ready to go to prison."
206.0,Provider,For you.
8228.0,Patient,"Basically, for her for her to do what she did yeah, and I mean we're going to court and stuff. I told her I my world, they said, you know they could come back on you, if I fight it. And she was like well. You know don't worry about me, you know the lawyer said he helped me if they do right and I was like yeah but I only want to pitch you today."
206.0,Provider,that's bad.
8228.0,Patient,"Right, she was she was willing for me to fight it and if they came back for her, she was willing to you know go."
206.0,Provider,To accept.
8228.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm like nah take it on the chin I do what I gotta do. And at the end of it, I do my probation and we are."
206.0,Provider,"Like I had mentioned before, why would be Defense wants to get off probation this time, so you won't be facing any situation where either your other family member has to be may be tackled legal issue."
8228.0,Patient,I don't know.
206.0,Provider,Think about some time people change behavior because they been monitors on once that's done. You go back to it so that's the thing.
8228.0,Patient,"Right, I mean at the end of the day, you can stop doing crimes or together. You can. do things smarter. You can move a different way, but at the end of the day, the only thing you can say is stop doing what would stop doing any crime for you."
206.0,Provider,"Yes, and that's always a option, so is that an option for you."
8228.0,Patient,I mean. Of course yeah I don't never do I don't think nobody plans to do a crime until it happens.
206.0,Provider,"That depends, because sometimes you know you're in such a situation that could lead to some type of you know, legal stuff coming down so if you avoid certain things you will be less likely to be involved. But."
8228.0,Patient,"Of course i'm not gonna. Go out there, looking for problems or nothing like that. You know stuff can happen."
206.0,Provider,Either with other people you associate with some time that become an issue. And you know.
8228.0,Patient,"I don't associate with nobody I mean. Honestly, with this way and the way things is like the friends, I grew up with like we don't hang out with each other, no more like honestly on a daily basis, I probably don't know no none of my friends, I literally don't see none of my friends, I grew up with on a daily basis. I might see. A girl that i'm dealing with or I might see my kids or my wife or. One of my family members, but other than that I really don't do much. hey nobody know like that so that's not gonna be a problem."
206.0,Provider,"I want, then you know you're saying that it's really you and."
8228.0,Patient,"me I definitely was the problem yeah. yeah I wasn't a problem any case I call it was because of me it wasn't my environment or who are hung around or not unlike that it was a drug case, so it had to be me. You know we're in the situation where somebody do something in my car I was with somebody and it was based stuff you know, it was a know situations like that."
206.0,Provider,"So do you feel that you're in a better position that you can avoid any type of cases with substance issues involving substance because that's part of you know, the growth as well, because if you. You know, not knowing exactly what's your own was a legal issue, but if it's anything that has to do with possession anything like that, so that means you have to."
8228.0,Patient,Be.
206.0,Provider,"away from all that, all together."
8228.0,Patient,yeah it wasn't the drug that i'm here with y'all for. was not the same drug that I was caught.
206.0,Provider,up.
8228.0,Patient,"You know. Right, so, in a sense it wouldn't be. My diction that I will change get me in trouble. Okay i'm i'm i'm uh i'm so far from the pills, and all that that. I wouldn't you know I wouldn't."
206.0,Provider,"So wouldn't be a case of like you relapse and now we have substance which you. operate so either way it's going to be you're maintaining that control of the situation. So, for whatever. Because you guys still have to remember the pros and the cons and what can happen if you were to go back to that routes. Right and then you i'm sure you know if they gel it already that it's not gonna be as easy from the first time, so it's you wouldn't want to be having a certain situation where you really have to go away from forget."
8228.0,Patient,"Well, actually this. This is my second time, so it definitely wouldn't be that easy again."
206.0,Provider,mm hmm So these are all these things you know I would hope that you think about before even involving yourself and those type of situation where.
8228.0,Patient,My mom tell me all the time. I know that will give you probation again this time you.
206.0,Provider,"Prison uh huh yeah so that should be a deterrence, because you want your freedom, and you know your kids your family needs your run so you can help out the door you open the one. And like I said you've been managing with that that so just gonna have to figure out some other ways to make make sure you don't have that same mistake again."
8228.0,Patient,yeah.
206.0,Provider,"Well, besides that i'm just more to was looking for quincy looks like no you've been trying to stay on top of things, but it show me that you may be missing some stuff. The php nine survey is over, though. Right even tell me when was the last time you dead."
8228.0,Patient,"or alive. cuz I remember, I was just a monthly thing right."
206.0,Provider,"yeah i'm doesn't say which one could sometimes could be monthly sometime it's. Bi monthly twice a month, so i'm not saying, but interesting it's overdue, so we already almost mid October so that's probably why a Sean overdue, and the next thing is the drug screen that's do now, at the moment. The last one was September writing so definitely did you get the new one year. Okay. So that's the other main two things we have to make sure you take care, oh so you don't have to be gone back to a virtual clinic."
8228.0,Patient,"Well sure I still gotta see baby they be slipping up now, I said the pH scale and instead of drug screen, but equally. server yet racing in about that."
206.0,Provider,"The band. Is that well Fuck yeah. and satisfaction, the one thing i'm not saying is like the frequency, but we do have the patient satisfaction survey. And bm the BAM survey as well, but the one that's super overdue is the p HQ night, which is. definitely needs to get done right away. But overall, you been maintaining common you know to all your appointments bouncy anything, since the. beginning of September so you've been on it with that that's well good so that can help in terms of the intensity and. Looking at one November comes around so i'll check to see if we need to kind of. scale back. And i'll see when Julie says so on and so uh How often is your prescription now. How long is the suspicion that should get."
8228.0,Patient,Is 28.
206.0,Provider,And there hasn't been any issues with just screen in any positive stuff besides what supposed to be in there.
8228.0,Patient,"No, nobody said to me. You know they don't tell you the. results, but no I don't I never got no dirty we are."
206.0,Provider,"efforts on if there's an issue definitely would be but up but sometime we not know early on, so that's why X if anybody discuss that with you. want again you making. Good progress with the profile, so you just have to keep doing what you're doing."
8228.0,Patient,Your. Best to.
206.0,Provider,So any update with your and the wife.
8228.0,Patient,"um. No. I told her after the last time we talked I told her I said i'll talk to my therapist therapist say that you shouldn't put all this extra shit on me and artist know that we really were we supposed to be a. She keep trying. Basically. Oh no like she I keep telling her like you know I need more whatever she saying, she trying, but I don't think she really trying like I just don't feel like she trying like i'm like you know, like, I wanted to, for one, you know. You I feel like you still talking to do even though him and and Jay jail, right now, but I feel like you're talking to because I be X and my youngest even though you can't really believe when my younger son be saying, but he say."
206.0,Provider,He said that mom is talking to this person.
8228.0,Patient,Oh no he said he'd be upstairs so oh no we just.
206.0,Provider,end up in a house or here in. This person was in there was. My son be upstairs and he'll stop here conversation.
8228.0,Patient,yeah but that's why I said you can't really believe.
206.0,Provider,way yeah.
8228.0,Patient,You know. For him to say that.
206.0,Provider,"Okay, how does that sound decision event side are you pull in ham trying to figure out what's."
8228.0,Patient,"gonna be like i'll be like heavy too because, like I said the youngest. Is his son so i'll be like wow I never said, you talk to your dad i've been i've talked to Jason and he'd be like you know, and then I have you have your mom and she'd be like yeah and then i'd be like. Well, you know. I you know."
206.0,Provider,uh huh.
8228.0,Patient,"You know, he never really could give me a good answer but."
206.0,Provider,"Like you always say can be a reliable source so. We can't forget that. And you know at face value, maybe she's not talking to Maybe she is young, because."
8228.0,Patient,"But when I bring it to her, she don't seven like like when i'd be like how you supposed to be moving, for me, you still talking to him, she never say she don't talk to him, and she never say she do. She just be like I am trying to move forward something like that she don't never answered the question, though. Just like the other day I was like you can't live two people or whatever, and she was like I know that and I was like so you say you love me I don't believe you love me. And I was like you know each other, she loved him and then like down to the conversation I was like see what i'm saying you never said that you didn't love him and then she'd go on with the more of the conversation, but she wants against do that and say she don't love it. So I don't know if she she knows she's missing the question, or if she just purpose, you know I don't know."
206.0,Provider,Maybe she needs to define what she means with the word love.
8228.0,Patient,Right.
206.0,Provider,"So, but again, you know she can still maintain if she needs to maintain relationship, but you said if he's not involved with the kids really certain relationship may not be really needed for to maintain but."
8228.0,Patient,Right.
206.0,Provider,And that's what i'm.
8228.0,Patient,"Trying to tell her that. she's not you know she she saying like she'd be like well, that is my baby dad or whatever, but you know yourself he don't you don't. You don't care about the kids you don't that's not what the end like I told her I said them kids baby so well because, obviously, if you're talking the whole time you're not talking about babies you're talking about Joel or whatever."
206.0,Provider,"Well yeah So what is she he's helping out with. place on an exam is it financial. Yes, and so well."
8228.0,Patient,"So know. Her. that's what I try to tell her he don't help out at the end of the day, he'd be used in her but that's how I that's why I say you love him because, why would you let a person use you steal from you cheat on you all types of stuff and you still be trying to deal with him. Especially, especially when you know you got. A a wonderful man that's trying to be with you, but yet you still choose him at the day. I feel like you feel like you love him if you if you can't get over him. To be with demand that you say you love and you say you, you want to be with and spend your life, whether you want your family back you know i'm a good, do you know i'm a better choice all today. I mean, honestly, the only thing that he could probably ever be beaten me in is probably. Sex wise maybe and uh I wouldn't say looks because i'm i'm on my hands and big do but he's smaller than me then the only two things that he could ever be probably beating me."
206.0,Provider,"But everything out all you need to know relationship. So if she's still not getting you know, especially if he had several kids and she's not getting any assistance or somebody that's there with her to make sure you know everything is okay, with the household those are important as well to be really be supportive but."
8228.0,Patient,"You would think you would think that a person would. Oh. I don't know how to cuz Okay, you know, on one hand, it could be looked at as us, but me personally, if I was a woman, and I have five kids. Three kids on on one hand, this man helped me raise three kids he's a great Father he's a great provider here love me to death he'll be there shit forever properly, on the other hand, I got this bum in and out of jail. He looked good he probably got some good sex and he can make babies, other than that. me personally, as a woman i'm going with the other dude that's a great Father great provided the one that's been there for me or that. You didn't had your fun being to being kids and an adult you know, had your fun you party you've been with different man whatever you should be with 37 years old, what more do you need like and that's what I understand that's what lets me know that. You know she she she has been trying to know she cook some tell me, she could you know she calls me every day now you know shit like that you know, but if you can't cut that man off totally. and use. ties to him now if it was a different subject, and I could trust you to not mess, with him, then I can understand the Co parent thing, but he doesn't want a Co parent."
206.0,Provider,Right so there's no reason.
8228.0,Patient,"Why, if he can't have the sex and have you like being his girl or a sideline he doesn't want he wants it all or nothing."
206.0,Provider,"that's something she really needs to know what's. Keep it. keep going back to him all the time because it's such a difficult time, letting go and that has to be something she needs to figure out. what's wrong that's all and."
8228.0,Patient,"Even if you're not with me, you still for yourself for them kids you need to figure out what's what what that situation is because. He didn't already bring you down he stole money from you, he didn't he didn't so like when she got her income tax he stole like thousands of like two $3,000 from her. And, none of this she gets back he didn't stoller car or that so at the end of the day, the guys have been the only thing he could do for you is bring you a hard date or disease and, at the end of the day. I don't understand you got you got five kids that they need to be raised up brought up even if you're not with me why would you pick them your kids hate them they don't like them. Even his own son don't like. I don't understand why, would you put them in that predicament. You say you hate, why would you wear I don't understand it."
206.0,Provider,"So yeah again, this is something she needs to work on, so be able to let go of that situation, otherwise any like even if it's not true, like you said it's still going to create a show in any relationship that she's in because this person is like always in the middle, in a way, so."
8228.0,Patient,Right. And like I told her you made it to where he feels like he got some authority.
206.0,Provider,"He can come in, whenever I feel like it, but cut it up."
8228.0,Patient,"He pulled up on you, he stopped you or that. He only do it cuz let him. If he would have never went with him and we were still living with each other and all that you think he would just pull up on you and pull up on us like that no. Because, at the end of the day, you didn't let him in like that, but now that you let him and you let him in your House your body order so now he feel like and not to mention you're still talking to him so now he feel like oh that's mine like I couldn't. You know you don't care about the wife husband thing obviously he's not going to respect it if you don't respect it."
206.0,Provider,"Right and you're not in the home and so. she's single person. But again, it. sounds like she's making a little bit of effort, but."
8228.0,Patient,madness.
206.0,Provider,"You need to see it, a lot more efficient when it comes to that at a price tension so figure out what what's the relationship or put some boundaries, if he does have to talk. Because, for the sake of the kids if that's the case they still need to be punctual there's no reason for this person to be on coming up to your House, at any time, whenever they feel like it based on to respect your home with godless you know if you're doing corporate on."
8228.0,Patient,"That day that's a whole different story, but that dude and he got he got other kids he not thinking about them kids May. know. That the soulless gc that this I mean she used as an excuse to, so why wouldn't he."
206.0,Provider,"Do you feel that situation is. You know, making your life more anxious or depressed."
8228.0,Patient,"Oh, sometimes it gets to me but i've really i've really you know, like I said i've been pad I pass that to where I get angry all the time, and all that. You know, right now, the only thing that really gets to me, is when she lied to me and I can't really tell her true from her life, it pisses me off, that a person can say this and say that, and you know she may mean to her, she may meaning. But to me or bullshit."
206.0,Provider,"Okay, so because of the history of mistrust, so you can always accept. What she is so she says as mature bed. Again, if she's trying to make an effort, you can always. push it back on her and then she's not going to go feel what's the point, because every time i'm telling you the truth, now you think is is alive. Unless you give your reason. for you to or you have actual prove that she's line I wouldn't just you know outright. not accept what she says, because, again I know it is difficult because if you've been betrayed but issues, making a point you have to. make some effort on your answer because it's hot and she really have to make after work a little bit harder to build that trust, but. She has to be willing to put the work in certain things needs to be like done shoe certain things you can't go back to doing the things that will be able to, otherwise you know there's not you know we're working towards a goal that you're trying to have."
8228.0,Patient,Right.
206.0,Provider,"So, but what are you doing to take care of yourself, because this is, you know this, been an ongoing and I don't want that so really hold you back in terms of August, you need to make will stop so. You know, not only do we cover it to be healthy as well."
8228.0,Patient,"Like I said I don't you know I don't sit there and wait for her her lies or her true for wait to see how it's gonna go at the end of the day, you know she may not feel like it, but. I still do me so you know, sometimes I tell her like you know, like what like she came to my house to one day she popped up over there cuz I I think I didn't answer the phone or something. And I would hear whatever she's like I called you i'm like so you pop up on my one these days you're going to pop up a summary going to be in here, and you film like so."
206.0,Provider,So what was she doing in.
8228.0,Patient,"yeah that's true like you know you pop up think he said oh sweet in order like like you good like we're not really a couple for real we married. So technically you're together. But you said that the numerous amount of time we not even together we've been together in a year, so you, you know i'm just giving you some of your medicine we're not together. You know, you were with me and then the next day, we are back with him and shit so you can't just pop up here and think that you know if you do pop up here and it's a woman here don't don't be surprised, like."
206.0,Provider,"Yes, she can. Because it sounds like you guys live in different different life so she. might come up and then. We act like you know. What you guys not. fully in a relationship."
8228.0,Patient,"Right, just because her situation is locked up don't mean that. You know i'm poster just automatically cuz you give me a little us you. cook me a couple of dinners you give me a couple conversations and you think that everything all good when I feel you know that I feel like if he came home today you'd probably be with him tonight so. i'm not going to just start what I do and it's not to the point to where I could just pull up on my wife and just. You know I gotta wait to you the day you off and all that stuff and all the extra stuff when she man God needs so like I said, you know i'm a woman, so I don't know, but then you know there's you still call it X for stuff like. And that's difficult for me because I don't got no problem, giving you what you need but. i'm the type of person that. You know Okay, if he gone for six months and i'm giving you stuff for six months, and then. After six months, he get out and you just go back fucking with him now I lost everything I didn't gave you thinking we was building."
206.0,Provider,That should never be the.
8228.0,Patient,"I feel like you shouldn't ask me for nothing, until we 100% secure like she feel she gonna say like she'd be like Oh well, my bad that you always took care of me and you're the only one that I got well obviously not because. You make it to where i'm not the only one, you got. I mean like she said, I always took care of her and I never had a problem of it, but I got a problem now because I feel like you're not my woman. me personally, I tell her all the time you another man's woman. When he went you went to jail you was his woman."
206.0,Provider,"Usually, if I went to jail."
8228.0,Patient,Right so so.
206.0,Provider,What makes you think that is so gonna sister then i'll go back time it's things why.
8228.0,Patient,"Every time he got out she did for the last, since all this happened, I don't know year year and a half, you know what. times already, she didn't came to me he went to jail three times, she came to me about 10 times and told me, she was done every time she said she was done, I fall for bring her back with open arms, two, three days later, say right, but every time they argue she had told me they done."
206.0,Provider,"So now, you know you're just gonna have to stay where you are the way you guys are monitored and if he does is he scheduled come on anytime soon."
8228.0,Patient,"I don't I don't know he in the face, so they didn't really give him he she's don't even know what he engineer for so. No."
206.0,Provider,No again. She needs to decide what she wants with herself with her life with our.
8228.0,Patient,"relationship, what are we."
206.0,Provider,"can have ever put people on hold to figure out what you want, so."
8228.0,Patient,Back stuff.
206.0,Provider,"yeah and again like I said last time, if you allow just continue to do so, sometimes you may have to make that choice Okay, this is, this is it. On this until you know use new filly you fully feel that she's ready to commit and that she's kind of done with that other part of her life. Was been causing problems for your relationship. Because if you always feel that okay at any point she's gonna run back for this person, then. you're always going to have that reservation, so you wouldn't fully commit or so her being with us also."
8228.0,Patient,And then obviously it don't know that. I I take care of her still because that's just going to let her feel like well.
206.0,Provider,He takes care of me so can buy still wanna deal with it.
8228.0,Patient,"right but. She had feel like i'm still going to do it, even though she doing wrong. So basically I need to tell her no."
206.0,Provider,No. So what's preventing you from saying no.
8228.0,Patient,"Oh no baby. i'm you i'm used to giving her wish you want. I wouldn't say if I ever if I didn't give her what she wanted I don't think she will go nowhere, but I don't know Maybe she. she's never really had to live a hard life, you know some of these girls and projects and all these babies, you know they got a struggle, they got. They got a scratch and call for what they want, she never had to do that, and you know a lot of people I got a best friend best friends with her sister. And she always tell me like you know she never had to struggle, let her struggle and it's funny because even the dude with me and to do you still argue and stuff. here because he was like man, he was like don't save her he was are you always come to our rescue don't save her letter fighter own battles."
