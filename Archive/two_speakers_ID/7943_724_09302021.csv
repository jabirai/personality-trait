But I will contain a monitor her and attendance. For transcription Oscar checked into the virtual clinic and is now in the session now."
7943.0,Patient,"hello, sir."
724.0,Provider,"what's up Oscar. I can't complain, how are you doing."
7943.0,Patient,"i'm doing pretty good i'm doing pretty good I appreciate it. i'm a i'm taking my lunch in order to do this meeting so i'm just pulling out of the hospital parking that I know we're not supposed to be driving during our meeting so. i'm just going to pull out of a driving light and into the shade but. yeah i'm doing well, I would say. I would say My only complaint would be. That it seems to be seems to be a hassle every month, trying to get the medication fulfilled from bright heart it's it's always something and I don't know why it has to be that way, and why it can't just be like on autopilot but. yeah it's always something and so. This month, it was that. It looked like I was going to be uncomplaining because I had my meeting with you on the last day of the month, and because i'm my UAE wasn't done until the 29th which was yesterday. But I called ahead of time and I let them know look like I i'm working every day i'm working 12 hour shifts and these days i'm working going to be working 16 hour shifts so. I start working before compliance opens and. When I get home compliance is closed, so I will do my test on the 29th and I let them know that like I don't know two weeks back. And so, for whatever reason, that message wasn't absorbed and they didn't they didn't take into account that mean you mean your meeting was still going to be. Within the month. Because when you talked on Tuesday I call them to let them know hey I actually got a meeting set and we'll be meeting on the 30th anyways long story short, they wanted to put me in yellow, even though I I hadn't come out of components yet. Right and then, once they once they situated that and I was like okay with them. I had to switch my pharmacies just because I moved to her said, I mentioned that before and. I was previously living and in San Juan Bautista really close to gilroy so I was picking my medications up and gilroy and. I switched out to CVs here in verse ED and chantelle put the medications in I was like man, this is great I call CVs and CSS like oh. My medications is not covered do my insurance which i'm used to so i'll use the good rx and I call to let them know that, like you know this is. This medication is not covered through my insurance so i'll be using the rx that's how I do it and Gary and the ladies like Oh, we don't we don't discount any country. And they do it in gilroy and she was like yeah it's it's per pharmacy it's up to the pharmacist, whether or not they want to do that and i'm good on do that here and i'm like I mean I don't know I don't know anything about rules and regulations for pharmacy so. weird but whatever like How much is it gonna cost and she was like well the medication will be a little over $400 and I can't afford that i'm like there's no way i'm not going to pay for."
724.0,Provider,All your your audio keeps cutting out.
7943.0,Patient,dead.
724.0,Provider,How your your audio keeps cutting out. Are you going to park system or.
7943.0,Patient,"yeah sorry it's just they were doing roadwork there, so it kind of drew me out for like a half a mile sorry about that um yeah no so. Then switching I was just like i'll just switch it back to go away, which is like an hour and 15 minutes on any given day and to do that. I contact shauntel to let her know what the situation is, but then I got a call Brian heart and get it straight with our pharmacy team. Then they reach out to shauntel as well and it's just this big huge process and i'm like, if I had that much free time because it's not anything that you can take care of within like a half an hour it's it's it's always over an hour dealing with like virtual clinic and. going to have that kind of time, you know I mean like I wish I did, but I just don't and so. gasol and. Luckily, my. The game here at the in the emergency room was crazy as it's been so I was able to sit in the charting room and take care of it. And Sure enough, it took over. It took over an hour and a half to get it straight with shontelle virtual clinic and the pharmacy team. She switched it over and the nice thing was is that the CDS and good right they knew me, and so I call it down there and the lady was like I can have it ready for you and a half an hour and i'm like that's great, but I won't be able to pick it up until tomorrow. And i'm not going to be the one to grab it my fiance will grab it for me and she's like that's okay so it's been a."
724.0,Provider,it's been kind of rough because you.
7943.0,Patient,"You started taking the medication and then you run out and you have this like laughs you know now for me it's been like seven days, so your mood kind of goes like this, you know it just. It just really freaking sucks like you just trying to get on track and just stay like a steady kind of even and. we're just really hard."
724.0,Provider,On take it as prescribed and the inconsistency is is not do your body's. Natural homeostasis any kind of benefit.
7943.0,Patient,Right right.
724.0,Provider,Do you and your your significant significant other only have one car is that the deal.
7943.0,Patient,"No, no, we have two vehicles, but like so she's also with bright heart today is her regular scheduled group meeting she meets at noon. And then we also had an appointment, where I had a technician coming out to my house. And he was there for like a good three hours, the plan was like eight o'clock and and he didn't leave until excuse me didn't leave until right before her group so. I knew, she was gonna be busy with that and she was going to be busy with the group. And then come, you know come one o'clock like right now i'm not gonna ask her to get on the road and head down there traffic's already starting it's kind of one of those things where it's best to go in the morning. or a little bit after the morning to traffic heads that way in the morning, so like if you leave around nine you can get down there and hour and a half, if you leave early in the morning, or in the afternoon you're looking at about two hours a little over two hours so. I know, and then, and then the right back and she has my son so it's like our son, excuse me. So it's just a hassle you know I mean and then offer offer stuff that I should be able to like take care of here, you know, like that has nothing to do with bright heart why CBS is doing that, but like. You know it's like what the heck man like they honor the good rx there why don't they do it here and it's just as drastic change it's not like it's either 40 bucks there and 60 bucks here, I would have paid the extra 20 it's like a whole $400 more. And i'm not going to say that, like that's I don't have the phone number one number two I mean who would do that when you know you know when you're used to getting it for like you know under 30 bucks so anyways."
724.0,Provider,"yeah could could it be like like a like an insurance issue or like that, like the company like the insurance company doesn't like dealing with or they don't have contracts with the other place. Because I mean you work in the hospital seat like like you know that the insurance really dictates level of care in this country right like it's like."
7943.0,Patient,yeah totally.
724.0,Provider,wider or you want to be what's in their best interest it's like. You know the insurance is like nope we're not going to cover that we don't cover this but they don't cover a lot of things shockingly like that that you would expect them to cover in a hospital unless it's an emergency and they don't have a choice. But even that there's like a lot of like push back so i'm you know patients that I dealt with.
7943.0,Patient,and actually having got.
724.0,Provider,Good.
7943.0,Patient,"I actually haven't had my benefits kicked in yet like I just thought on full time and so i'm considered full time now, as far as like ours go, but my benefits don't kick in until October 1 so. This is all like through medical. And so you're kind of covers the suboxone but they don't cover the second my second medication. And so what's. The adderall. Okay, and so, and so. I was getting it through the good rx and it literally cost me like $22 she just adjusted it, so I was expecting it to go up a little bit, but it literally went from 22 to I believe the lady said it was gonna cost me 41. And whenever that's not a big deal, but when I called the CVs here they're like we don't have to get our act so it's going to you're going to pay out of pocket it's going to be 442 books and i'm just not going to do that that's just ridiculous, I mean I don't have it, you know."
724.0,Provider,I don't have it and most people. don't.
7943.0,Patient,Like that that's obscene yeah. But yeah other than that things have been going really well i'm glad I finally got a chance to talk to you like just kind of one on one. Some things came up here that I really didn't feel comfortable talking about in group. So you mind if I share or.
724.0,Provider,"that's all like the group. Do you get like feedback for like how you we can span and stuff like that from your peers, the the engine individual therapy is like where you can like talk with. Like with with anonymity were like you can unload all your stuff is this is kind of like were you supposed to like really like like like bigger so sometimes So this is the route, not so much like so it's okay to not. Be 100% forthright and then group. Some people gab and sometimes in the feedback that you're looking for is not what you're going to get from a bunch of different people it's can be very confusing sometimes So if you got something you want to get off your chest, by all means, this is the place to do it."
7943.0,Patient,"yeah totally so. So we moved here TIM said August 7 before that I was I had been unemployed for a little over a year I lost my job. And we had been living in my travel trailer for approximately two years, up until. Up until I got my place here and reset even when I moved to my side we moved in the travel trailer and I was staying in chowchilla. At the at their rv Park, because the rv park here and there, said is kind of really crappy and I just it soon as I pull them just to check it out. I was like i'm gonna get robbed here, you know just just the vibe that I got so I found one in chowchilla That was really nice. And it's about 20 miles out of out of my shed, but it was fine it wasn't a big deal and then, and there was a month to month deal and blah blah blah so. Here we're here to work out for us, and we really only ended up staying there for about two weeks before I found my my house I moved into my house, things are are going really well my relationship is pretty solid. I don't really have any complaints, as far as my relationship goes we're both in recovery and. I don't know i've been in love with with her, for a very long time. We understand each other and things are pretty solid as far as that goes. But. A couple of weeks ago I started to notice this is gonna sound really crazy I don't want you to think that i'm like a limited so a couple of weeks ago I started to notice that there was some stuff going on in the House and I wasn't hallucinating i'm not on drugs. I started to notice that there was things going on, it made me feel like someone is breaking into the House, the reason why I say that is because a few years back. There was the same class stuff happening at my mom's house, I was going visiting my grandmother's I was renting from my grandmother, and I would be visiting my mother, like every other weekend. I had a very bad relationship with a business partner of mine, when we had a business together it ended poorly she was an old high school friend of mine like one of my best friends actually and. She was I don't have any proof of this, but. She was like breaking in to my vehicle she had gotten into my mom's House had left like. Was was kind of silly but like writing shit on the mirrors and then like I would take a shower and it would fog up and you would see these messages on the frickin mirror. And at the time it was like I was going through a lot my mom was going through a lot with my dad and my mom had actually my mom had actually been had started the divorce, with my dad then she's just kind of finishing it up now. But you know, he was seeing another Gal so my mom was under the impression that this woman was the one doing the stuff and it was hard to try and convince her that it wasn't this woman, you know that I had fears that it was my ex business partner. And it was kind of this kind of targeting me, you know i'm nothing was stolen from the House, nothing was taken, nothing was taken from me. So, like I I was always afraid to tell somebody because i'm like this is gonna sound completely insane like and I don't want to sound insane I just. You know and shifts happening it's obvious that it's happening, and you know it's like it's hard to think that people are just going up and believe you like, I even even saying it to you now, it sounds crazy and."
724.0,Provider,It sounds like you're being you're accurate or you're thinking paranoid right.
7943.0,Patient,"yeah right totally and totally man and I, and I see that 100% I don't i'm not like a super paranoid person I just noticed things I see things. And so i'm one of the things that that goes on, is they draw like a cross on all this shit and i'm not hallucinating like it's there. I showed my my girlfriend like do you, what do you see right hand she's like I kind of looks like a tea or a cross and i'm like okay so it's there it's it's not that it's not there and i'm not just seeing it all over the frickin place it's specifically like in my vehicle or. On items at my house. And when it started happening here and. I fucking really fly flashback to when it started happening at at my grandmother's house and, more specifically, at my mom's house in roseville. So my explosive business partner, she lives in Los banos which is like I don't know 40 or 50 miles from our said, and I know she has friends here and Mercedes and so. I will be at work, my my wife would be or my fiance would be home, I mean it would be cool my fiance were take off for an appointment like to the bay area be gone all day i'd get home that night and there'd be like there would be these little signs. either on the frickin table or etched into the refrigerator. It really started to fucking scare me because I was like I don't know I don't know how someone's gained access to my house and I thought about i'm like shit the garage door opener. is sitting right here on my advisor I kept my house keys in my backpack and my backpack is in the front seat, and you know here I am parking in employee parking thinking that everything's all good. But really someone could break into my car and then they would have access to my house and so, then I thought well it's too late it's too late now because they have. If they made copies of the keys then that's probably how they're getting in so then i'm starting to be really cautious with my keys I started to be really cautious with the garage door opener. I explained in my life, what was my fiance what was going on, and she was like okay I don't want you to be paranoid, you know i'm here, most of the time, so I don't want to think you know somebody breaking in, but when i'm gone, you know I kind of have no control over it, and I know she doesn't. But just don't feel safe my new place and that's freaking ridiculous man and I don't want to feel that way I don't want to come off as being paranoid or crazy. And I also don't want to run to the police and give them the story and it sounds fucking crazy, you know what I mean something like what what do I do man like I I don't want to be driven to this like state of insanity. So um I got some I got some terms and some don't flood lights and then the House has already set up with adt but it just it wasn't turned on. And I had every intention of doing that so like I called and got that all set up and that was a service guy that was there today carrying on everything and getting it going. And then i'm buying new locks for everything to switch out the mocks because i'm really not apparently person I really don't. have anything bad coming to me I didn't steal from her it just the relationship ended poorly and we lost the business um and I feel like she has always kind of blamed me for it, I haven't had any contact with her, I don't know how to get in contact with her. And I can't even tell you 100% that it is her it's just the only person that comes to mind if you were to say hey do you, you know."
724.0,Provider,Have kind of these are.
7943.0,Patient,"People that right exactly she would be the own she would be the only one. And, and so, and so now that some of these things have changed, they got the ATT hooked up and I got the cams and we're going to put them all up, and I know that i'm going to be switching locks out and stuff like that. it's kind of calms me down because it was hard for me to even sleep like I got my son in the House, I got my wife in the House, I don't want to hurt nobody but i'll be damned if someone is going to come into my home and and hurt us, you know what I mean and so. it's kind of calmed me down, and I feel like you know what I mean like will be okay, I actually talked to my neighbors and I was like hey. just keep a watch out this this and that I feel has has been going on, and my buddy was like we've had a few break ins here in the neighborhood he actually has cameras up my other next door neighbor has cameras up and so. I really just haven't been able to tell anybody you're like the only person that i've been able to tell and. That also makes me feel unsafe because i'm like what if something happens to me, people are going to think that it's completely random. People are going to think that I got into some random act of violence or something and boom, I was taken out when really that's not the case, and so being able to get it off my chest is one thing. The other thing too is like I know i'm not hallucinating I know i'm not seeing stuff. And I want to be able to talk about it openly and I want to be able to come to us solution, you know you know, want to be able to resolve it some some and. And so you know, being able to talk to you about it and seek your guidance and hear hear from you is really important to me. Because I don't want to be crazy, you know I don't I don't want to be crazy I don't want to talk nonsense. And I don't want to be worried all the time, like I don't have a common man I help people out on a day to day basis i'm a pretty good person as far as you know, regular life is concerned. I don't have in common, you know I mean, and so I don't want to live like i'm on the edge, you know what I mean and I don't do drugs anymore I don't drink. um you know I don't have regular hallucinate hallucinations you know I mean I know this stuff is is regular, for me, you know what I mean. So you know just being able to talk about it and kind of work through, it is very important for me because I don't I don't I don't want to deal with this shit by myself, you know what I mean."
724.0,Provider,yeah what are some of the things that you're finding inside the House.
7943.0,Patient,"Okay, so, for instance, the the the cross. All of a sudden on the tag of mine on the type of my towel at home there's like 15 or 20 little crosses on their arm on my on my shirts it's kind of like scratched in like as if you were just to take like a something sharp and just kind of press down on it. And it was scratched into a few of my shirts. The back of my car um it was scratch it's it was stretched into the plastic back there. Just just that just that, like I said nothing was stolen, nothing was taken. And you know, of course, it made me paranoid i'm thinking well Fuck It is like the food poisoning now or something like did they get in my refrigerator and they're like poisoning my food, but we haven't gotten sick from anything that we've eaten at home or cooked. And so, you know that kind of chilled me out too because i'm like all right well you know it'd be obvious, I would be sick I would have some kind of symptoms."
724.0,Provider,But people in your House would be not really well so.
7943.0,Patient,"right that doesn't that's not going on, you know a lot. alive, but like that hasn't happened um but yeah that's kind of that's kind of the long and short of it, I know it sounds crazy chuck and I don't want you to think like losing it like i'm i'm not losing it man like it's it's it's obvious it's there. But like yeah it's just I just want it to come to an end, I wanted to stop."
724.0,Provider,You know how often do you are you finding these things.
7943.0,Patient,"Whenever one of us is not in the House. So it's like i'm going to work all the time, but like if my fiance leaves. Sure enough, when I get home that night I will find it somewhere. On the floor on the floor like on the floor you'll see it like records or someone took. Baby oil or something and just on their finger and then boom put it on the floor, and so you catch it in the glare on my sliding glass door. right around my son's height my son doesn't know how to draw the the costs or letters or anything it's he's two and a half, so he says jibberish it's screw. and his and his hand prints you'll see his handprint certain places. it's not a print, but right about right around my son's high on my sliding glass door about four or five times those across boom boom boom. She saw that as well you know I asked her like I didn't tell her what it was I said, do you see anything here and she's all yeah it looks like a cross, you know how did that get there, I my son didn't do that. I didn't do that."
724.0,Provider,"But maybe maybe your son did and it's not like intentional, but maybe just over time, you know, like like oil stains in your hands like. Especially I got kids and no matter how often I wipe my windows down i'll come back and just a different points of the day, or whatever it is it's it's a mess right. But it's not uncommon for them to to drag their hands across and running me and if things are drying in. different points of the day, it is possible that patterns will emerge out of that that's incoherent or just by random chance that these things start showing up there's you can't rule that out, you know what I mean you can't be like you can't. Totally dismiss that because it is, I can you know what I mean so. I would, I can't you're absolutely right yeah I would try to make records of these things that you're seeing and the other thing too is like. You are a little nervous right and paranoia is a strong word. Based on your history, so you got you know your reporting previous experience with this type of stuff so part of you could be looking for these things to."
7943.0,Patient,You might be.
724.0,Provider,"Like I am anxious already so you might be looking for things and in discovering things, and if you try hard enough you'll find whatever it is that you think you're looking for things that might be out of place. So if you're seeking it, you will find it, you know what I mean like you will find things that necessarily don't make any sense or shouldn't line up, but then we're going to attach a value system to it and then it's like they do it in studies it's called like. Something bias like shit I can't even that right there on. It but it's a bias, essentially, which means like the study is invalid because you've already gone in to this thing with a pre determined outcome so. right but flawed right."
7943.0,Patient,"No you're absolutely right, because i'll get into this mode. When I get home to where i'm at i'm looking for it. Right and I look and I look and I look until I until I find it, I find it somewhere, you know what I mean so you're absolutely right, with it, and the other day I caught myself doing that and I was like. What the Hawk like Why am I looking so hard for it, the oh The other thing is like my medication my my suboxone the strips so I it's that's how it started, so it started with. My wife pulled out a pack of baby wipes and you know baby wipes come into white plastic. And you could see the freakin slash marks in the in the baby wipes and I was like what the hell is this, and she looked and she's like I don't know she's like I don't know what that is. But you can see it, it was like almost done with like a knife or a sharp end he doesn't play with Nice he's not you know. sloshing around on stuff but there was like a tone of them on the baby wipes and that's what started this whole thing I was like oh shit not again, and so the same thing was happening on my soapbox and like. i'd open the suboxone and I know that foil it I know it crinkles up very easily, but these are clear like cross marks and it's clearly like indented with something it doesn't come out of the box that way. And so that's when I was like fucking somebody excuse my language, somebody in my house somebody's been in my house and somebody is doing this, you know what I mean. And so I stopped like trying to look for it now i'm just like on this mode where like. If this is really going on, get to a solution, find a solution, but don't go down the crazy train and that's not what I want to do. So a stop like being so paranoid about it and be tried to like think like a like you know, like a smart person would think and like. A process of elimination like what can I do to put this to an end, you know i'm number one to stop so who, if someone is coming into my house to stop them from coming into my house. make my neighbors aware, so there, they are all their eyes are also up and looking you know, make sure that I get my cams up and get get the alarm system going on, and you know, once all this happens and, once this is all in place. and seeing if i'm still thinking that i'm finding something, then yeah I probably would say that you know. You probably need to talk to somebody about that you know what I mean because it's it's clearly probably going on in my mind I don't see how somebody could jump through that many hoops. To you know just leave some marks behind I don't I know i'm not i'm not stupid i'm not crazy I. know that probably wouldn't happen, you know what I mean so. So i'm okay with number one not driving myself crazy number two trying to find a solution and number three being open to help if if I still feel like it's going on, after all this stuff you know that i'm trying to put it to an end. You know so that's where i'm at with it, and the last couple of days I just kind of been calming down and i've been feeling. A little bit more comfortable, because I know that there's a resolution, I know that there's a way to be able to stop these kinds of things from happening, if they're happening and. And I also know that if I continue to see this stuff after I have an alarm after I have cameras, you know after outside monitoring going on, then I have to be open to some some medical help. You know I I really scares the shit out of me because. Because I don't want to be like. I don't want to be crazy, you know what I mean I feel like it's I feel like it's going on. But if it's not going on and i'm losing eating, then I need to get help you know."
724.0,Provider,"Well, something that nobody else can see but yourself, so if you're if you're pointing things out and then your girlfriend's like. yeah I can see how that that looks like what you're saying, or what you think or you know what I mean again like if you're you have to add, or you obsessive compulsive anything like that. yeah honestly good now. it's a framing thing and like I said look like you're this is occurring because potentially in the past you've had a traumatic event it's lingered with you and now you're seeing that pattern emerge again but you've associated things like this with that experience. And ruled out other things already that by just by random chance, like the kids making a mess or anything else you've already ruled out that kind of because to you it's like, here we go again and you're working up you're reliving the event right it's trauma. So hallucinations by and large, is an individual experience like No two people are going to lose say the same thing if they do, then, is there something else going on right."
7943.0,Patient,Maybe right right.
724.0,Provider,"Maybe it's an alien invasion, or whatever it is. right but typically it's a it's an individual sport. So yeah you see. Things that are similar to what you're describing, then you can take some some assurances that you're not completely off base but you might be so obsessive that you're seeking these things out now because you've been triggered and now your brand's gone into like a fight or flight. trauma and now you're looking for it, and when you're looking for things. You don't become very objective when you're fixated like that. concerns. You know there's a lot of stuff going on right have you, is there a history of hallucinations like in your family have you had hallucinations in the past auditory visual."
7943.0,Patient,"Okay, no Sir."
724.0,Provider,No drugs no Sir. cocaine use or anything like that.
7943.0,Patient,"I I used to cocaine previously, yes, Sir, and I abused it, yes, sir. But um but yeah but I, I never I mean i'm not gonna lie to you when I was when I was using cocaine, you know I used it heavily and i'd be up for days on in at a time where I mean it wasn't. To say that. yeah sure isn't. To say that you that you. yeah that you weren't that I wasn't crazy because of the cocaine yeah for sure for sure I was, but I have not, but I have not used on cocaine and years and and a half and I don't have regular hallucinations I didn't have any hallucinations prior to the cocaine. And nothing like that in my family."
724.0,Provider,"So how old, are you. i'm 4343 i'm. yeah I mean if you're looking if it gets the point where, if you can't get it under control and you feel like you need an evaluation, you know, we have the people here that can do an evaluation for you. chantelle is your she's a nurse practitioner of the highest you know, education, you know that so she could help you, you know point in the right direction on this fixation that you have again if you can't. start there. stop looking for symbols, I mean I could look around right now in my my little Office here, and if i'm looking for crosses eventually my brains going to start making crosses if i'm looking for triangles i'm a vision to start finding triangles right. That doesn't mean that i'm paranoid it just means that i'm fixated."
7943.0,Patient,Like okay.
724.0,Provider,"You can't you can't pretend, though, that you know abusing cocaine, did you smoke it your snort it would you do. cocaine and do psychosis makes people do things that they don't recall, and especially if they're sleep deprived. But we can't pretend that there isn't some potential war long term impact or damage that that's caused your brain. or your body right and that doesn't mean that you won't be prone to potential flashbacks or experiences, or maybe a hiccup you know your medication was delayed all kinds of things, who could play into effect. So if you're honest with that as like a possibility. It will help maybe explain away some of the things that you might be going through does that make sense."
7943.0,Patient,yeah totally.
724.0,Provider,"If you reality is your reality like if you lose grips on reality, then obviously you have a problem that's why auditory and visual hallucinations or. You know, from a practitioner standpoint it's easy to start identifying it right. Because yeah you're seeing and your and hearing things that I can't see or hear but that's not your problem necessarily you're not getting the auditory hallucination. And you're seeing things that are clearly there because you have a witness to the fact Okay, so not crazy, you know what I mean don't ever think that, like in a sense, like like crazy is subjective that's not that's Not a word, you should use, but you are looking for things. Maybe in indirectly you're looking for things and they can be a compulsive issue there right and that that creates paranoia to. Your work up you know what I mean so. If you have that in your history that's a consideration okay that there might be a little bit maybe some cognitive. delay or cognitive damage but it's not it's not impairing your day to day ability to live all right, you know so there's like no biological free launch anything that we do anything we put our body we could potentially pay for further down the road but. You know the answer that we take in the beginning, so. You know, stop looking for patterns, you know I mean. But if you feel compelled to and you keep finding him that I would tell you like talk to chantelle maybe they can calibrate medication and maybe there's an assessment, they can do, maybe there's something else going on, but right now, as you and I talk it doesn't seem. unreasonable no because you have witness testimony that supports what you think you're seeing and you are probably seeing these things but they're probably not what you think they are you're probably. Because the previous trauma and you're associating these things with that experience it's very common you know, like somebody is in a car accident. And you know they think they're over and then five years down the road they witness a car accident brings them right back you know what I mean the."
7943.0,Patient,Right yeah.
724.0,Provider,The process that you haven't gotten over it.
7943.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"I mean so right, I mean this is the first time you and i've talked we haven't been able to unpack like some of your history, but you know as of right now. The way I see is there, you get some pre existing drug use that could have impacted cognition long term there might be some things where you're feeling compulsive. Those things might be there, or they might not be there in the context that you think they are but you're taking steps you know security system is always a good thing to have in your House, when you have kids So even if it's not for what you think it's going to be still a benefit okay."
7943.0,Patient,"Right, no."
724.0,Provider,"it's not impairing your or impeding your ability to work you work in a hospital setting. Okay. So all these things are going on. I would monitor it. be honest with yourself if you feel like it's getting. unbearable or starts to impair your ability to perform day to day activities like anything else you know now suppose I talk to chantelle let her know what's going on, and she she's she's a peep sight prn right or PM or NP she knows her shit. she's been there, I mean so she's managing all kinds of stuff. she's an asset that we have, and I would utilize."
7943.0,Patient,Okay.
