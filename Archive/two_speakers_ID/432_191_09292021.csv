And I used to see a foot doctor who said they can do surgery where they can look at El behind your ankle depending how I did it but. Honestly, I would I only see that doctor anymore, it was probably seven years ago, how many years ago, one team that doctor and he just told me about a surgery, so they can do, but. You never put me on like a plane or not, in my family doctor at the time, my head she's wanting to send me to the specialist but. They didn't do anything, this has given me. My medication really."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, this makes this makes perfect sense. Well, with what you're saying you had this tarsus tarsus tonto How long have you had this pain."
432.0,Patient,"I want to say um I didn't get that where I had to do close doctor nice thing. About seven years ago, I would say, was why I why I brought it up with the doctor, because I was starting to have more. And when not constant that's when I thought, like goes on all my feeder comes in for me to have painted it. So ongoing for centers is the pain getting better or worse or the same. Well, I have medication, it seems like it's more stable decreases the pain don't take it away of a heart. But it makes like it more manageable."

432.0,Patient,And the. ankle.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, I want you to always. I want you to look at the bottom of your feet every day and wear shoes when you walk around Okay, I want you to cover and reason I say that anytime I people have any nerve damage to the feed or. Any torso terminal anything concerning with the nerves to defeat always want you to make a point to look at your feet look between your toes look at your feet. Because the feet are so easy to neglect, you know the hands, we look at them all the time, if we get some stuck on our hands will see. Our arms, the same way, but the feet, you can get something stuck on the bottom or your foot some stuff in your foot. And people will go and won't even look at the feet, so I want you to make a habit just looking at your feet touching them to see if they're warm do they feel warm day feel cold. That lets you know about circulation potentially okay what's the color what's the color your feet. If your feet are looking blue that's usually not a good sign, I had a person just call me out it wasn't in my patient she said her toes return and blue so you need to get that checked out she had basketball problems. there's a lot, you can tell about feet and hands and your body just got to look and see if there, how it feels see. What color it is when you pressure toe is red and you let go does that, and it goes white and you release it does the blood go back in quickly we'll go over that again. Look at the bottom of your foot i'm looking at mine, as we talk and go all the way from the bottom, all the way down to your heel and take your fan and run over your feet, too, so you know what normal feels like for you okay. But i've had people come to my office with nerve damage to your foot and they've had things stuck in their foot they pay cuts on your foot and. They couldn't even fill it so just make a point to Pamper your feet okay."
432.0,Patient,"Actually, I think, over a month ago, or maybe two months i'm my insurance, a person to my house to a check. What is it a year off the Z. So that like that, like."
191.0,Provider,"That model filament test. yeah that mana filament test they do a little like a little prick on your foot yeah. So you definitely want to. check and rub your feet, so the next time you and I meet be prepared for foot check Okay, and remind me. Put your foot up to the screen will check for circulation and everything okay."
432.0,Patient,"you're not supposed to. From my helpers work to do, the assessment."
191.0,Provider,"I tell you what, if I can get that full assessment, I think that will be great let's get the full assessment. Now right and. yeah so we'll get that food assessment, I think that's a great idea because it has something. So foot assessment from insurance company because that's great It gives me a baseline to work with, and let me see here definitely and let me ask you this, let me grab a pen sorry any thoughts so plans of harming yourself or anyone else. Okay, seeing or hearing anything that's not there. No okay any chest pain shortness of breath. Okay, any stomach pain nausea vomiting diarrhea constipation. Okay, any any changing medicines. Right any recent er visits."
432.0,Patient,No. Okay.

You just feel free to join us, and if there's something that time you want to share, about your feet. Because we take the time to learn from each other, some people have like nerve damage in the hand, some people have the chronic back pain, a lot of back pain, so you be new with the foot, we have a person with the. amputation, so we try to. learn how each person copes but we strengthen each other okay.
