12762.0,Patient,I believe this was an intake appointment. Before I seen Julie and then I don't have julie's take me back on or not there. um kind of confused about the whole situation it's been a huge run around for about the past month.
540.0,Provider,Could you write in the chat what your pharmacy is. Did you send up.
12762.0,Patient,"Yes, I was trying to look up the number here."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so I just love to carry knives now so hopefully they can see if Julie can just call you in the script until you can. I think that you do have a group assignment. So you have a group assignment and it's Tuesdays. I think it's the group that you were in before. And I think it's the eighth time."
12762.0,Patient,Okay.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so just make sure you make it to that. This tomorrow, I guess, so tomorrow at 8pm. Eastern time um. Alright, and that's your phone number."

540.0,Provider,"i'm gonna write that down. So, Chris since you've been out of treatment, have you had any issues or troubles with any like type like homicidal or suicidal ideation."
12762.0,Patient,"No. Non aggression wise or anything i've been kind of depressed here lately, but I mean given everything that's going on and holidays, it was kind of given figure it'll pass, but no. No, not at all nah homicidal."
540.0,Provider,"Well, so with the depression there's obvious things that we can like start to work on as, as you can like have this space to really like vent to me and talk with me. um but if it starts to continue Where are you think medication may help Julie just talking with Julie, about the depression, especially like in your initial session with her on one on one she can try out and prescribed medication for the depression, too."
12762.0,Patient,OK. I know i've tried some in the past and haven't had any luck with them so i'm kind of reluctant on depression medication honestly okay.
540.0,Provider,Well we're the ones that you've tried.
12762.0,Patient,I want to say is oh loft and then I can't remember what the other ones were i've tried two or three.
540.0,Provider,"Well, maybe that's something that we can make it to be for us to start working on in therapy, at least to try to help with the depression and I know that you don't have the kids so much and you don't have everybody in the House so. What is your normal routine i'm getting home like what What do you do you try to pick up the kids or."
12762.0,Patient,"um I was but i'm a foreman on a construction crew i've got a crew of like five to 10 guys and. i'm wrapping up one job i'm at this job this week i'll be back down at the other job next week, I mean i've got two jobs going on at one time running an active job and finishing up this job here. So i'm bouncing between being four hours away from home and being two hours away from home and I don't mind driving the two hours are about an hour and 45 minutes, really. But it is it's so hard to do something after getting out of here after 10 hour day and driving you know hour and 45 minutes to two hours home kind of hard to do anything throughout the week yeah."
540.0,Provider,"i'm sure you're exhausted to being a foreman alone. what's your work schedule like is it Monday through Friday, or do you."
12762.0,Patient,"I try to keep it Monday through Friday. Try to set goals for the week and we are going and. Maybe a little early on Thursday, or something but yeah it's usually no later than Monday through Friday okay try to keep it about 40 hours. So."
540.0,Provider,"Over time, you said."
12762.0,Patient,Since everything.
540.0,Provider,going on.
12762.0,Patient,been on overtime for about past three months actually putting in about 50 to 60 hours a week.
540.0,Provider,"to feel like financially, you need it now that you have to do you have to provide like what finances do you have to provide for your ex girlfriend or ex wife."
12762.0,Patient,"I buy all the diapers all the clothes all the wives anything she needs for him right there. help her out with a little bit of money for cigarettes and stuff. Just simple little thing, but no, I really don't need to work, the overtime I just I need it for something to do."
540.0,Provider,Mental aspect of just buying the time.
12762.0,Patient,yeah but I make darn good money I just I need something.
540.0,Provider,"Have you thought about so obviously is getting re engaged in treatment, have you thought about maybe even putting time like going to the gym doing something that you can give you like the physical escape mental escape."
12762.0,Patient,i've actually a gym right across from my house and I don't know how people do it before and after work I have no idea. Was they don't work hard enough if they can. Go to the gym before after work.
540.0,Provider,"yeah well your I mean your works, a lot hands on so yeah maybe we'll make this a goal I don't want your phone to die, and I did give them a message to see if you don't hear anything today just go to group tomorrow okay. Can you hear me. And I just have to express so since you were discharged and the discharge was not just the finance, but it was getting two appointments. And then so like group and individual therapy, because it was a bit inconsistent, we need it like vital that you need to be compliant with it. And usually what happens is it's going to be the first 60 days, where it's kind of like a probationary period, or you have to make sure you're making it to everything and doing everything you need for therapy and letting us know if there's barriers that we have to help with you on okay."
12762.0,Patient,"My only barriers are my work schedule at this point and. If i'm here at North bend then i'm home by i'll write about seven o'clock or so and do anything, after seven o'clock in the evening, if i'm over the road. i'd probably get back to the hotel by about six in the evening or so."
540.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, and know that."
12762.0,Patient,i'm a little more flexible than what I was.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, good all right. and know that if say one week said so say you miss out on an appointment on Tuesday for group. Julie has multiple group sessions throughout the week that you can be like hey can I please make up this week on a different time but just making sure that you make it up, so that you don't have those no shows that you don't have that just inconsistency with getting treatment okay."
12762.0,Patient,"I know she's got another one, like, I want to say seven o'clock on Thursday that i've hit a couple of times they're just because of my work schedule so yeah i'll keep up with that for right now, what are we going to do counseling wise and group requirement wise on everything."
540.0,Provider,"So, right now, so i'd say the first month or two months we're gonna have to do like twice a month therapy and then it's weekly groups."
12762.0,Patient,Okay.
540.0,Provider,"All right, and then so after that, like probationary period, then we'll start talking about so groups, you have to I believe it's like three months of consistency that you have then they can start spacing you out. But individual wise after two months, we can start doing it monthly. But as long as you just make it to your appointments and i'm not going to hold you forever So if you don't have a lot to talk about that you want to talk about. i'm never going to be that counselor that holds you for 60 minutes to talk nonsense and waste your time. But it's we do have to have to check ins to just see what's going on, if you want to talk for the hour great if you only wanted to talk for 30 minutes that's fine but it's just more of seeing you and just getting that that part of treatment in as well okay."
12762.0,Patient,"yeah honestly i'm not really a major open communicator i'm more of an introvert than an extrovert i'm not real big on sharing a lot all the time, but I mean I figured if I search on so you probably won't get an hour out of me to have i'll tell you that ahead of time."
540.0,Provider,"And i'm fine with that it's whatever and that's The thing is, some some people need the 60 minutes, some people need. It depends on the person i'm not going to pull your teeth out, I just want us to be able to kind of work on that aspect and most times it is. introverts and it's hard. therapies hard to just get to know someone so just making it there that's our goal for you and I right now is just making our therapy what we talked about is just going to be more free um but just let's get into compliance and just make sure that that's a priority to. And then your medicaid. Getting stable on the meds. Okay alright so i'm going to work on seeing if we can get meds for you today, if not just make it to group tomorrow. The 8pm okay. Okay."
12762.0,Patient,"All right, all right, I appreciate it and. You enjoy the rest of your day."
540.0,Provider,"Always you too, Chris and you want to make our appointment for our one more appointment for this month."
12762.0,Patient,Oh sure okay. usually have later evening appointments.
540.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah I have, are you Eastern time right. Yes, yeah I have 8pm 9pm 10pm even 11pm."
12762.0,Patient,Okay let's go for I don't know 8pm okay.
540.0,Provider,"All right, let me."
12762.0,Patient,And usually. Mondays are probably gonna be the worst days to schedule something for me on that's usually one of the longer days I have so. yeah if it's a PM anywhere else throughout the week I should be fun.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. And the only thing we can't do is like group days, so we can shoot for. Why don't we do Thursday the 27th. At 8pm."
12762.0,Patient,Did you say that.
540.0,Provider,"yeah. Alright, so yeah just make sure. whenever they said, like snow surveys are in group asked for them, but just do the surveys and be on top of those co pays and all your treatment needs counseling group counseling all right. yeah okay all right, so I will see you on the 27th."
12762.0,Patient,"Alright, that sounds like a plan, thank you."
540.0,Provider,"Perfect alright have a good day Chris. For transcription That was my bio sex social at Christopher duvall um. I am just contacting provider Julie, right now, so i'm going to just let her know that i've I was very clear with him on the expectations of being an in treatment and doing a probationary period of 60 days, making sure that he stays on top of everything and. So i'm just going to type to her right now in the background. Alright, for transcription and I just spoke with Julie and provider it's his provider with bh age. So she's going to be calling him in a script she does have concerns with the financial and compliance issues with Chris the last time he was here, and that was why he was discharged from our program and. She is going to call the rx in and try to get him into see her as soon as possible, I told her that I spoke with him multiple times throughout the session started off the session with it ended with the vital miss of compliance with all treatment efforts. And I said that I laid out the financial survey is uds individual and group therapy. Really treatment planning that's going to be our short term goals at this point in time for Chris. and his reengagement in therapy is just to be able to get him compliant and stable and treatment. I let her know about the financial aspect that on he stated, we were double charging him, so I don't really know that part of anything i'm counseling wise it's not my. area of expertise here. So I just let her know to expect him for group tomorrow. Other than that, nothing else for this bio sake social. He stated his substance abuse and he's had it surrounding him as well, no. No suicidal ideation homicidal ideation he has been experiencing depression, along with the things that have been going on in his life and the holidays, so will continue to monitor the depression. He had relapsed since he's been in treatment, so no taking that as well, other than that nothing for transcription."
