5921.0,Patient,yeah I was pretty out of it.
298.0,Provider,"Why don't we go down to two milligrams and let me give you something for the sweating it. at two milligrams at least it's still working on depression. that's what I love, even at two milligrams it's still doing it. And then there's a thing called could Jensen that helps with the excessive sweating and the side effects of. emptiness that abilify can have."

5921.0,Patient,denton okay.
298.0,Provider,"And it's also called benzo tripping and I really don't know what it takes more dosage wise. For a person so i'm going to write the prescription and a one milligram but i'm going to say take two tabs but, if one tab does it then good you just need one, and the next time you see me then you can tell me, it took one tab or two tablets to get it. To to. To be ID so you can take it twice a day as needed. sweating. restlessness. So it can kind of dry you up so make sure your drink lots of fluids with it."
