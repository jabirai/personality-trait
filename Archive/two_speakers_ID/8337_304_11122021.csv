Yes, yes, so yeah I wasn't expecting all of those new people I didn't know that they had already started because Dr Oliver you know sees everybody first. Like for the MED EVAL but yeah I wasn't expecting. So many new people, and so I you know appreciate, and I know you probably appreciate to it's like yeah let you guys, who are, he said, you know, let you go let you old guys go first, who has been a. yeah some of these the women I don't know the women especially. The new ladies are just not quite there yet, and they needed a lot of information and education Program. yeah yeah."

So."
8337.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
304.0,Provider,"there's a couple of. No, no, I appreciate your patience, yes. we'll see I think I think probably in joey's group, since those people are so new they're going to be coming every week. Though they'll be there. You know, in the next group as well, so. yeah. we'll try and take care if they will they'll stay, if not, you know I I wouldn't be too surprised either so."
8337.0,Patient,The groups coming back next week yeah.
304.0,Provider,And I hope enough it if it does get really because what gosh we had what 10 people yesterday um. So yeah really 10 even you know eight I really don't like to have more than eight because we ran over to about 15 minutes on i'm sorry anyway yeah I think we'll just we'll see if we get if these ladies end up staying and and don't drop out maybe we'll have to even set up another.
8337.0,Patient,their livers your church Doc.
304.0,Provider,"You know 10 people it is kind of what they recommend is the limit but then like it's hard for like the doctor and I like we would just have to find more more hours in the day, you know we have to find like another time to do another group. So, but we'll see if they yeah I think I I think i'll give them a chance to see if they're going to stick around and if they don't drop out. Well we'll maybe have to think about another group times that works for everybody, so."
8337.0,Patient,"All those people paying really they don't have to pay, I mean."
304.0,Provider,I think. The on medicaid.

304.0,Provider,"yeah but still yeah I think you know I think there is, I see some clients with insurance or you right they have to pay, you know, maybe a copay or a personal and I do just see you know, like anything if you have to pay for it, it, it means a little more to you."
8337.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. If they would have to do that, they would they would see but they wouldn't come with a big problem for them."
304.0,Provider,Great. yeah.

304.0,Provider,"Be how they behave the next couple of weeks, but. You know, definitely I think it's it's just only fair that yeah you don't really have to sit through all that and and listen to all about."
8337.0,Patient,Like.
304.0,Provider,"helpful. yeah well good to see you Richard i'm I won't keep you from getting some rest um so yeah we think, and then I think that's also why next week might be kind of pat.

8337.0,Patient,"No, I got it."
304.0,Provider,Okay yeah cuz you've been in the program long enough. That yeah I think he's fine you know it's a couple weeks out yeah because normally you'd come back to group. In two weeks thanksgiving.
8337.0,Patient,"What was your girl's name it had been doing a class for work and she had commerce to you towards your week kind of heavy shirt girl. she's still doing it, she had to go to class for. Group."

8337.0,Patient,done. you're doing.
304.0,Provider,"yeah. i've been hearing about her so yeah maybe you know, maybe she'll hopefully be back soon when she's finished training and maybe some of these other people are going to filter out, I have a feeling so."
