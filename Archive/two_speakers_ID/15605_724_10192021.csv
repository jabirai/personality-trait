724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah I can't complain it definitely has its perks. I don't have to leave or drive or deal with traffic or anything like that. yeah save money by not spending on gas and eating out all the time, so. yeah it's definitely the future, you know what I mean like that's probably what. A lot of jobs, going to turn into her soon enough. Things as. Well yeah those be supplying the man takes a while to get done but."
15605.0,Patient,i'm pretty sure people are about to get paid to do nothing is what it's looking like it's popping. Up enough for robots to do the Labor now. yeah so people are just going to get like 2000 bucks as long as they comply with stuff.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean it's been happy if covert taught us anything it's kind of been like a trial run for you know what I mean like people that were. forced to. stay home and not go to work, they were getting supplemented income yeah so anything, it seems like it might have been like a direct trial trial trial and error kind of thing so."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it didn't seem very well planned out because the whole supply chain, seems to be collapsing."
724.0,Provider,Which is something that has been bothering me.
15605.0,Patient,"A lot I mean I feel pretty. stressed, always a good way to put it, but like nervous I guess fearful in a way i'm just anxious about. The fact that we might run out of food and water here soon, and nobody is preparing for that, like we're not getting that situated we're just hearing on the news a little 10 minute story about oh yeah and. You might be able to you know you might not be able to buy what you want, at the grocery store next year, you might have to just get like rice and beans and people just don't even like. Listening to the implications behind that story I. don't know they just. keep doing it and we're still doing we're if we're like we're just going down a hole and it's making me more and more anxious every day, and I feel like with this looming court case I can't do anything about it until it's done. And so i'm just sitting here being anxious whole day, and so, hopefully, when this case is done I can finally move and get my hands on the situation and, like try to. do something about it because right now, it just feels hopeless and kind of nerve wracking."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it definitely is. You know the person that's allegedly in charge of the transportation is out on maternity leave that pete bootleg guy he's out on. Three months maternity leave, meanwhile there's like a major crisis going on and consciousness wars. You know, so it all compounds right so it's like there aren't enough people to work so there's not enough people operating kranz is not enough. People at the docks on load the supplies and all the ships are like backed up and every time I every day that goes by, and like like like a cargo ship is backed up and weighing it see to offload. You know material is diminishing. It is it sorts of compound like like."
15605.0,Patient,"me like because that one's clogged up that means the next two are going to be clogged up and that too is going to be six clogged up. Right and. I can live without my iPhone I can live without bullshit that I don't need, but I want food and also like the clean water supply. they're like hinting that in California it's just running out not going to have it in five years, we just have to make drastic changes and they just float those stories in and like. don't expand upon it and don't have a plan for it there's like we're running out of water."
724.0,Provider,"And the deaf, I don't."
15605.0,Patient,I just clap and then i'm sitting here 24 I want to have a kid eventually someday and I just can't like I said. I can't do that to the kid right now.
724.0,Provider,"It is nerve racking. I mean, as far as like people should always prepare for like a environmental you know strategy, especially like out there in California, you know you guys are sauce or vulnerable to earthquakes and I can really be disruptive."
15605.0,Patient,To the drought that is giving us like we're out of water and. California visitors coming out of like good farmland and all that good stuff and also the air quality in. fucking horrible right now I my mom. was like. I couldn't I don't even want to visit right there and she's just living in it and it's just the swamp smoke.
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah a lot of the patients that I talked to the fire so yeah I California for an environmental standpoint isn't a real tough place.
15605.0,Patient,"Luckily i'm out of. The ocean kind of blows the smoke away, but I have family that's in the thick of it and also like thinking about moving locally and, like the rest of my life, it definitely affects that because I want to get out of here now right."
724.0,Provider,"Now, oh. Where are you at with the the Court stuff how much more time, do you have to."
15605.0,Patient,"You have done. you're supposed to have it done by now, but they added a stipulation still doesn't i'm they had to push it out another two weeks, which is. what's today the 19th it's in two days. You know I sent a pretty long emailed my lawyer about how this thing is really fucking up my life and just like. I don't know her in the prosecutor i'm making like a unique kind of deal, and this is a new situation. And I was just asking her i'm like you guys, please figured out i've done everything we've asked for like four or five months now. And i'm just terrain and money, I need this shit to be settled, so I basically Center that and then i've been doing everything that they asked me to do as best as I can. In two days I mean i'm really trying I think everybody can see that and also the girl that call the COPs in the first place she's she's ready for it to be over she never wanted me to have any of this so."
724.0,Provider,So the the state is pursuing it versus her.
15605.0,Patient,"Will that's how it's always been she's really immature and she didn't know what she was doing. And I am not good with self control and I didn't know the consequences of what I was doing. And she didn't think about what was going to happen when she called the COPs she was just like this guy won't stop texting me, and you know she could have done it on her own she could have just a little bit. Man, the man, as you say just by talking stuff out and all that, but she didn't she just brought the lion and the log really took it from there and kind of. pursued me on her behalf, and she took a step back at first and then at this point she's been more on my side she's been like. repealing this the restraining orders, so that we can talk again and then we've been hanging out and she's made it clear that she doesn't want this anymore. She wants me to be able to move and move on with my life and, to be honest it's affecting her too because her decision to not handle it surely the whole, the whole thing is holding me back a lot and that's like guilt, on her and. I mean I don't know it feels like nobody wants this anymore, we all just want me to be able to be better and more healthy which isn't going to be in jail, I mean, obviously, I think that, but I think that it's pretty."
724.0,Provider,yeah it's pretty obvious that you know jail is the. is the best solution. To improve people don't have like a really solid.
15605.0,Patient,"plan in my head once I get it done and i'm also talking to people like you, so I now have a professional support network. And you know I don't see any benefit of throwing me wolves you know and just making more of a burden on our criminal system, it seems like I should just be able to move on, hopefully, after these two days."
724.0,Provider,Right you don't have any previous legal issues correct.
15605.0,Patient,"No, this is my first thing and i've been super respectful with the judge and the judge seems like a stand up guy. i've watched him handle a bunch of cases by now, because I have to sit there, and he seems like. He seems like the kind of guy that I want to be a judge it seems like he's looking out for the people versus like just trying to make money for the system, or whatever you know, or like some judges seem like a bias and they want to put some people behind you know bars or whatever, but. I watched this guy handle case after case and he seems to be trying to do what's best for people so that gives me hope."
724.0,Provider,"fair and objective, impartial that's kind of what they're supposed to do."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah it's more like there's so many laws now and the people's mental state is so fucked up that everybody's committing crimes right now and they're not like. Crimes because you're a bad person it's crimes because of a fucked up situation, for example, I watched a dude I think he took a gun off of a shelf at a store and like threatened to kill himself or something with it. So things like that, and I just watched the judge he's like you're not going to get anything from jail, you know here's some community service and think about what you did, and I hope you he is like sincerely saying I hope you get better and all that."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
15605.0,Patient,Even that with me to with the prosecutor and the judge they're all.
724.0,Provider,Your audios muffled.
15605.0,Patient,"The prosecutor and judge them to be decent people that don't just want to Fuck me up, which is good."
724.0,Provider,So you said they added a another stipulation of what is that.
15605.0,Patient,"The therapist has to give updates on my mental health now every 60 days which maybe you would be willing to do, what do you be willing to do that."
724.0,Provider,Do they have a therapist appointed i've got a mental health therapist substance.
15605.0,Patient,yeah yeah um I wouldn't have to ask if they need like a licensed therapist I think honestly I think you'll do fine I think they just get somebody who's like profession.
724.0,Provider,They. Do they have to be licensed. If they wanted like a chemical dependency update it has to be like I could do that but that's outside of my like my scope technically.
15605.0,Patient,But yeah.
724.0,Provider,But we have no workers here.
15605.0,Patient,"And so I had to because I talked to my therapist and he basically. He was a he was kind of a day by day, I called him. And he just didn't answer he didn't reply to me like I left a message for him and then so two to three days later, I stopped by I left the same message that I needed to get Ahold of him. Because my court case was coming up, and he just didn't get he just didn't reply, and so I called him a third time and they're like Oh, he wants to talk to you, your next appointment, which was another few days away but finally get into talk to him he's like yeah I don't want to do that. So we just turned me around for like a week."
724.0,Provider,Just so.
15605.0,Patient,"He doesn't want to do that and i'm like dude this is times, then, to do, and so I have to drop him and find a whole new therapists within like a week and so it's been. actor, but I think. It all situated."
724.0,Provider,"So, is he was a court appointed or no."
15605.0,Patient,"No, there is only one court appointed dude the Court basically tells me to go find people like you guys are court appointed technically because i'm. like somebody like I needed some kind of alcohol. treatment, so they told me I need therapy alcohol treatment and. mets like mid management. And i'm taking care of all this."
724.0,Provider,"So we'll kind of bed recommendation, so they want."
15605.0,Patient,"um well I talked to some people, the person at dhhs that I talked to I had one appointment with one hour. And she tried to dig into my whole history within like an hour and so she had no idea who I was he just asked the worst parts of my mental health and that's it she didn't ask about my coping mechanisms or. How i'm able to deal with it naturally solution, basically, is like you're pretty fucked up and I want to put you on a ton of meds and I was like I don't want that. I want to be able to handle it naturally I think I can handle it naturally, and so we decided on as needed anti anxiety medication, they just picked up today."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and what did what did they prescribe."
15605.0,Patient,You don't. know how. I draw. As needed. yeah i'll probably have to talk to a doctor of gaba. Just let her know about that.
724.0,Provider,For sure you're not taking anything else low just this.
15605.0,Patient,"You know, this is the first I just picked it up today, so this is brand new okay."
724.0,Provider,yeah definitely let her know that you're being prescribed this that's prn so it's as needed. The. The other component for the mental health counseling have you found someone that you think you want to look into or.
15605.0,Patient,"it's been all over the place i've been like I said I tried with that guy and before that it was, at the same place and that guy just ended up dropping all of his plans for personal reasons. Now i'm seeing some Indian dude on zoom that I just saw yesterday. I don't know if that's going to work at home, he typed out a report, I think, so I think he typed on my first report for the core i'm gonna go check that in my emails. So he might be the one that's able to type out reports for me. And then, is in terms of like an actual. Referring therapist I mean it's been difficult to find one, so I think i'm gonna just tell the courts i've been trying my best, and I can show them that and then keep going from there and collect my money."
724.0,Provider,Are you self pay or the US insurance.
15605.0,Patient,"i'm self pay and i'm been burning like I burned all my money and that's Another thing I put in the email is like The longer this drags out the worst my State is in, and so it's kind of ironic this mental health thing is starting to take a huge toll on moment."
724.0,Provider,"Well, maybe I maybe I can find somebody that's tool licensed within this agency that you could get it seems like like the mental health thing is the priority of a secondary is alcohol and there. there's overlap between the two of them. So if I agree yeah So if I can find a provider that that does mental health first and. substance use second were there do license and you would only have to see them."
15605.0,Patient,You know it'd be awesome. yeah I would always save.
724.0,Provider,"You some money, so why don't we why don't we do that, and we do have licensed mental health counselors and. and actually somebody that that that works in the same state that I do as a potential, but we have those you know we have those qualified professionals with."
15605.0,Patient,"Great yeah if I could tell them that and it's all licensed. I mean look i'm pretty sure that would look even better, and then it would make it. A lot easier on me right now I feel like i'm spread out doing the same thing, three times and burning and kind of money so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah, so why why don't I focus on getting you like that support on. yeah that's something I could do for probably pretty. yeah oh so yeah why don't we. Let me start reaching out. To the management, like my supervisors pretty good about moving people over. So we'll get the ball rolling on that any interest is there anything that you need. Other next i'm going to give them an update on what specifically what you're working on so you're working on a court case that requires a level of mental health counseling secondary to."
15605.0,Patient,"such as this here's this specifics this specifics, is going to be. some kind of alcohol treatment, but with my state I don't need the whole MED treatment I just need the mental health counseling part of it. I mean that's my diagnosis self diagnosis, I don't you know I haven't heard that from anyone else but i'm pretty sure i'm not like a severe case I could just have the therapy side of alcohol treatment, and then a. Regular therapy, I think, is one of them. Probably every two weeks, something like that okay."
724.0,Provider,"I can't which yeah which you would get with a mental health provider you'd get like like complete wraparound service look at health counselor and I was licensed of chemical dependency. It would it would just be the same thing, like we would just be addressing the overlapping issues at the same time."
15605.0,Patient,"And then the third one is the meds which I just took care of myself um but with the therapy they added on that every 60 days they want a two or three, paragraph update. or like notes or something like that and that's the part that my therapist wasn't cool with so that's the specific thing is. With the therapy in the alcohol treatment would be 60 day updates for the Court like a quick letter. and asked specifically I was like do you need something in depth and. My lawyer said just a quick letter."
724.0,Provider,"Which which which we do, we have like like I have people on my caseload that are wrapped up in drug court, and I have to send weekly reports to their probation so let's talk about the Agency, you can do to like we have we're equipped to do all those things."
15605.0,Patient,"that's awesome because I talked to the guy the guy I talked to yesterday was not. Okay, with he was I don't even know if he spoke, that great of English, but he basically said that's not something that's even possible or whatever So hopefully you know if you took care of me, better than these guys man that would be awesome."
724.0,Provider,"yeah i'll. You know i'll get this thing kind of sorted out for what's the. what's the case in particular, what are you looking at if if it goes South what's what's the penalty."
15605.0,Patient,"Oh, the worst possible scenario is prison time but that's the thing with this charges it's one of those charges that goes anywhere from a $2,000 fine to prison time so it's like."
724.0,Provider,what's the charge what's the. Legal charge.
15605.0,Patient,it's called it's labeled stop talking.
724.0,Provider,"And i'll be able to elaborate like the situation, based on what you told me."
15605.0,Patient,was more the harassment side of stalking I don't think that there's like a I think that just falls under the same thing.
724.0,Provider,Okay yeah yeah so what i'll do is i'm going to send an email request to my clinical supervisor about placing you with the qualified gradually qualified professional. And a lot of times of mental health counseling they can do both right that's like a master's level clinician.
15605.0,Patient,yeah that would be great yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So i'll do that for. Because I mean the goal is to get you like complete wraparound service it's like that's the whole point have medical provider, you know therapy all that kind of stuff so."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah honestly that sounds like something that would make. Not only the judge happier but also be actually better for not just my case, but my mental health in general, like somebody that I actually keep seeing versus some Indian doctor who asked me these generic questions rates it on a note and then sends it to the. Judge every two months, which is what i'm doing now, I guess, I don't know."
724.0,Provider,yeah if the people's defenses though some of the best doctors are from like packs they had stuff like.
15605.0,Patient,That and not make it like that's the issue it's just he didn't really understand me he didn't know I need. To spell words out for him that's why it was like great at English and it was also on zoom. So that's kind of why yeah the miscommunication. I was like trying to explain my whole situation in a few minutes to this guy who was like hardly understanding it.
724.0,Provider,"All right, okay so that's what I want to do for event i'll i'll reach out to my boss that will start getting this process grown. And then i'll let her know that whoever takes you on to contact you or the schedule a like a follow up soon, maybe in the next week or so, or maybe even this week just kind of touch base and see. What you might need it, probably because you said you have your court, a couple days."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah i'll know better, within two days. Okay i've done everything I can but it's still not really situated, so I don't know if they're going to grant me it for sure we'll see what happens."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I can be there for you alright, so let me work on that. And then we'll have somebody contact you and schedule a follow up probably I would. Probably shoot for like early next week because you'll have post court information god's just more to work with."
15605.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,It wouldn't make it to have somebody try to snatch you have a talk to you next day or two because you're not gonna have all the information currently so let's do that so that's going to be the game plan. So just sit tight and i'll you should be hearing from us all right.
15605.0,Patient,"Right, are you going to do an email."
724.0,Provider,"yeah they'll contact he wants he wants to switch happens they'll contact you and then schedule an appointment, but i'll follow up i'll make sure that something others saying i'll know more about it here shortly. And then, once the therapist gets assigned to you then i'll just remind them to schedule an appointment with you. Pretty easily."
15605.0,Patient,"I just gotta say like I appreciate this lot i've talked to a ton of people having to deal with this, and nobody really. took care of me like you did just know or just in general talk to me like a normal person I feel like i'm talking to a bunch of robots over here and jumping through hoops and stuff, so this is real. This just makes me feel human you know, thank you."
724.0,Provider,"that's the whole point man, I try to have real conversations with real people, because we all suffer from the same bullshit, and I mean it's just at different points."
15605.0,Patient,I can't tell you what it means to me.
724.0,Provider,"yeah well no worries man, I do this because I generally want to help people, so I appreciate you so i'll let you know here shortly what's going to happen and then we'll go from there alright."
15605.0,Patient,"Alright, thank you."
724.0,Provider,"Are man you keep it up be good. For transcription. Edward is requiring a licensed professional. That can work it on that can work on is dual diagnosis somebody more qualified than myself because he's required legal intervention. So our contact Catherine my supervisor, to see if I can I haven't placed on a social worker or a mental health counselor license type. caseload that way they can work with both is dual diagnosis, through his core what's that kind of stuff his primary needs is more mental health, that it is substance abuse is definitely secondary. So i'm going to get in place, accordingly, thank you."
