The foot and she was like. She was like well if you.

I was like Why would you put your family my business like that wasn't just your business to put them in by you telling me. What you're going through you, you you open the door for them being a machine to I didn't want them in my sheet and she's like Okay, I understand that was that was wrong on my part, but I just need somebody to vent to outside of you, because we've seen I said I mean."

Because it's just a higher risk of me getting pulled over I was driving a car, we had a little agreement I ended up giving them $100 a week, just to help out around that bits and stuff and. She was just every time we get an argument should just start taking the keys of my key chain right like i'm a child of something you're saying.

Man, you should have my bet you should have my they still couldn't find the backpack and I knew there was looking for the best pet when I was still in there, but I was so like frozen I say nothing. Like i'm not gonna say me I got is turned on my leg I got a GPS on my leg i'm out on bond Loki got a warrant out in the next county. A misdemeanor one but still this rubbish one and all the time, like I don't get the time to put myself in this ship they not asking me know i'm not saying they even if they do ask me know and i'm not gonna say me because i'm going to do it so i'm not gonna volunteer."

It was like 12 police's inside that House I wasn't gonna vote in my situation I wasn't gonna volunteer the fact that. I knew were her personal is a person, she was looking for I was just so quiet man, so it wants to see call me later like you should have my becky lynch go to my she is a girl. I know he went through your stuff that's a grown ass man like he going to do he's going to do, and if he would have did in front of me I would have stopped doing like. I did when I found out you're stuck with me so where's my stuff I said looking to dress she found a just like okay why you as a name that's a good. time for you or your sisters games like like I do have your back a hedge your bet even when we want to eat, because that morning we was on we went on good terms either I say you know saying like. Why, why would I let somebody do you like that you know, a sense of boom you found your stuff. I say, but why would you tell them people to tell me the slot Why would you even let your people call it a pony show anyways like you know my situation, and you know I got this or like you just know. Already, how to do you like what's your first and last name and it wasn't it wasn't me just being in contact with the police is a violation of my release my conditional release I can't even get pulled over. If I did have a valid driver's license just content, which is a violation, why would you do it. You know, essentially, I wasn't thinking about it, like Danny I thought she was mad at me so he was just letting him do whatever I say then you're really known you know, a sense so. I end up going back, because what if it was like a will, and so I will dance is already rough from there and that's what she was talking about when she was like a. And I told him I was like Why would you tell them to tell me to go if I hadn't introduced you like I didn't you know say my sister called the police on him and. And, and we in column on us, I know about you, but I have it on camera because I just got ptsd like that I record everything, so it was a face it, nobody had my phone facing down, but like. The camera was facing not like i've got the part where the police, like a buddy you got to go to like you know police don't whisper. And he was right there in the kitchen, I was sitting on the couch on living room like y'all heard that. It was a sheila Oh, I heard I swear to God, I was too busy looking for my stuff I say great you heard I swear on my door and do it, you know how Narcissus do. Oh, you, you really gonna think i'm allowing my daughter, for you is you serious i'm like well you on on the phone, I say that, but in my head i'm like you, is, though. Because I know way you a didn't call them on me, too, because they not just got appointed Somebody tell them to leave without you saying you want to both of them going into. You ain't gonna be standing right done, and you know your sister hurt than me and tell me to leave Oh, I thought you just live. On your own because the situation was a you know, two instances, and now I would have I let I let her bank fade into that sheep. But mental note cuz I I just needed some would be so own it will tell us are already kind of rough from there from my standpoint but she thinks i'm buying in all of that, but really i'm kind of sad about it. But i'm still trying to make the most of it, because this must miss my predicament and. that's when she goes fast forward to the night, where I live in the morning, the night of the. She goes like that don't sound right bro like look to her phone and look at the doorbell camera then and all. see what it was that she said to the police outside and see what she said to the police after you left. Because don't trust, if something doesn't sound right, then you know you know it sucks and I was like you know what I. I smart as up, I believe I you know I never thought about that, I mean good luck i'm gonna do just that you're saying and on. whisper endorse the middle of the night live on, and then I say some more things but just venting straight Vinci, I never like. trash and or tap way you know, a sense so she wake up next morning on to wake up wake me up like Oh, I heard everything he's she's telling you look through my phone i'm not alicia alicia like. Tom Tom finish, and she was like oh again trying to take the keys, I mean I got an interview tripping well i'll take us in Australia so. On mo mo words get done around and our last show my non because you like yeah you do need to go, I say a bit, so I grab all my stuff and i'll put it in my car. And she's like a if you leave it on nima nima husky off your chain, so I asked, I left it on the account. And I peeled off no Sam appeared off, and that was dead I don't got time everything but rather me wrong like. I still I never really told you how I went to jail, but you know, saying that was a people, but we was getting the argument you don't call Joe brother in law over that. You claim you call them over there, because you wanted him to take me home but it's like you so drama. You so john when you bring anybody everybody in our business bro knowing you ain't gonna leave me so. Why are you doing on it, you know, save you ain't gonna leave me why you go to the extent of like bringing people involved they don't get tired of US coming to say the day when you don't want to be safe route. You brought him over and look I ended up you know i'm saying, then he knew I stayed at so you know saying my house got broken into some we got two TVs got to you know saying, and you know I stayed in Rochester hills, so I was in jail and my house got broken to, of course, so on. He. ain't played it, you know they kicked my ass right out, you know saying and all my furniture, everything was a put on the curve, you know saying no by putting in those stores and then. So only thing i'll say before she went back and say from you, which was a duffel bag for the clothes, maybe a couple extra trash bags from the crowd you know saying and. That was that so it's crazy, how should sit there and say man, I did I did these days for you, she did, though I went to her bank statement not added up all the phone call she spent like $885. In 40 days on phone calls and then on she spent like our money, money to get my core out of on empower and then my bond was 500 so I added all day Oh, I gave a 1600 and some change. When I got up like I gave it right back to to the team, you know say even arrived rounded it up, you know get all their money back you know say I did appreciate it, because she asked fishy unexpected with. She holds."
207.0,Provider,"But. My question to you is. In reviewing. In reviewing the. Just everything that you've been saying about just the issues that you had even with your. Your friend is looking at. What are you going to do in terms of reevaluating the people that you're hanging out with and seeing. What do they mean you any good, are they helping you to me a goal that you set out for yourself and where do you want to go because right now the position that you're in is that you stopped by yourself."
10603.0,Patient,"Oh, my bro I just hate the fact that it is cold like I am used to being alone, I am alone I don't like folks like this shit Of course they hurt because I love the girl no Sam but. i've been here before you know saying this is not too different you know, Sam from the girl that brought me up her and ended up leaving to go back home. Like i'm not i'm not tripping because i'll get over in due time, like i'm not i'm straight on it like i'm really straight on it like I could deal without friends, I promise you, I can. And I could be single to like i'm not tripping I just I hate when I feel like my down first done been betrayed when I handed out, please. I don't hand this shit out like friends that I got I don't have for us like I don't have no new friends item made within the last 123 or four years they've been like. they've been lifelong friends or the ones that i've kit that are more recent I met in prison and that's a bond that you really can't break so it's like you know saying. I don't i'm not i'm not sure average Joe like I don't care for that she I prefer to be alone, you know saying just the way the world settle it's not no no he's worked like that, but it's like I just really hate it because I just know."
207.0,Provider,"My. end of the day, you still you still have to think about where do you go from here i'm not telling you you're saying that you're you're fine with being alone, but then it's one thing to be okay with being alone but it's another. To being forced by the hands of someone else to being alone or to be placed in a position. In the position that you're in."
10603.0,Patient,"See the city FC to sit there. And play these games with her at my expense, or just keep it pushing you know saying I got to keep you pushing because I feel like is there any longer. For that you know saying I got my license is suspended i'm not opposed to be in no car so every time I do turn this bitch on and go from point A to Point B are risky and pulled over going to jail. I got one i'm out on bond I got to go to a fucking kroger's every night. And a lot myself in the bathroom for three hours because every 24 hours like your your GPS tether has a life span of 24 hours. Then you got to charge it for at least three before it's fully charged so i'm in a bit, so I gotta I gotta do you're saying put headphones on because all you hear is people banging down the door Tom it got a piston shit. I just don't say nothing know what is there to say no i'm saying I mean there's been some lightning here i'm closing bill. And i'm charging my lady, you know how to do that every damn nice night, you know saying its own sunrise is at 8am sunset is at 530 is barely night my headlight out which risks me getting pulled over so I only do drive in the daytime so it's like. i'd be yo I watch something on our own a red I got my little toiletries I went to the dollar store and i'm not me a toothbrush deodorant toothpaste, a rag some flows so so I dude I gotta doing that so at go every day I swear i've been going and. As far as food like. i'm trying to Brian worry buddy you know say it's just my main concern out here right not use this code and I know I opposed to be in his car alone with the damn car own, but this call always stays on cuz. it's cold no i'm saying I got no blanket you got no damn pillow ship on the cats they got food they got water they got all they got a little bit. They got a little box back here on the flow know saying we are good we good we just i'm just trying to make it the fluid so. i'm not worried about the one that I got because it's a misdemeanor one they know they don't extradite in Florida for misdemeanors you just can't come back for real. or on i'm just worried, I just want to get done with this felony case because I don't want that top of one over my head so after that."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know I hear what you're saying in terms of you know not wanting to sit and you know. pretty much been a position where you feel like you're you're sucking up or. or whatever, but i'm not talking about. Her specifically i'm talking about you, at some point in time it's for you to come to a place of recognizing. The that it's not just the decisions that you make, but the people that you surround yourself with to help you to move to the next phase of your life. Like you, you are stuck in this you're on this hamster wheel and you think you're getting off, but the reality is you're not getting off because we are you today, you are in a position where you are. you're you're you're now living out of your car and you don't know the face of what that is going to look like. And what the face of what that's going to possibly look like is either you stay in your car for the next few weeks until you go to court or. You go to a shelter or you decide for you both petition makeup and then at least you have some place to stay until. You can figure out your court stuff and you can do with all of your legal stuff and then leave Michigan and come back to Florida. But even so, as we talked about you also need to have an effective plan, if you come back to Florida, because all you're doing is either jumping states jumping county. The problems is going to follow you Everywhere you go, because when it's all said and done, Adam needs to change his mindset Adam needs to re evaluate how am I going about the things that I do and who am I having in my circle even, no matter how small you want that circle. You still have to re evaluate who am I going to have this inner circle that's going to help me and lead me. Now i'm going to give you this credit in all the time that we've ever met you have your your your your the passion, or the intensity or just how your anger has come across it's like. i'm not fighting with you but okay that's how you've always been and surprisingly, how you are some what mellowed and you're like you know i'm just angry and i'm like oh wow that's that's a different look of anger with Adam because usually, when he's angry, he is angry."
10603.0,Patient,it's more of like a tire defeated feeling not show it.
207.0,Provider,"You know, Sam but like to be definitely. Let me take it, let me tell you this when. you're tired and defeated, but you haven't really gotten so tired and defeated that you have gotten to that point of sitting back and really truly re evaluating the company you keep your friend that you were talking to yes, she came to. But in the end you got to charge the in the midst of it. you're with this person."
10603.0,Patient,"This shirt is it I don't know if i'm a long story, but it's like. I don't know if I long for this, but it's like she always do like remind me of what she definitely when I was in jail, I mean forget the fact that I paid it back i'm talking about the time just the principle of what she did you know."
207.0,Provider,"Before you, you have a lifetime. Or you embedded for her for a lifetime."

That you're absolutely right, you can't put all of the responsibility on them, because you play a hand in it, but just like you just said. You knocked over the first domino you knocked over the first domino and so now, it became a ripple effect, yes, I have to take responsibility. In how I allow my emotions my anger to to get the best of me, and what I have done to me in the position but at some point in time, in your life. it's you know, taking a harder look at the people you need to be a be a little bit more wise in the people that you associate yourself with because at the end of the day, the people who you associate yourself with they bring out the worst in you."
