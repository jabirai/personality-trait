148.0,Provider,Good i'm glad to hear that yeah it's a. much healthier choice than to take. The opiate for pain. yeah yeah.
13637.0,Patient,"There were so many times that i'm either I would accidentally overdose or I will be in withdrawal and my kids would have to see it they'd have to. A couple times or several times scout. i've got a kit and that's not learning the rules of the road here. There were a few times when you know paramedics came took me to the hospital and I just had gotten, to the point where. I thought I my kid i'm not going to make them live through this anymore, you know, above and beyond, for me, i'm this isn't right that they have to see their mom and that. kind of condition. is really there was just July 21 I made a turnaround and I said no more, this is it i'm going on suboxone and i'm committed to this and we're not going to do anymore opiates we're not going to do anymore. You know. risky you know is that too much is that gonna run out too fast."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah you're constantly thinking and having those concerns to. When you're taking that because it. just get a hold on you huh. yeah.
13637.0,Patient,"So let's go stay seated okay. So anyway that's, the only thing i'm kind of reading about is i've got to get the insurance now because I don't want them. I won't miss out on sticking with this program."
148.0,Provider,"Good good good good i'm glad and we you know brain hurt does except so many insurances. um are you working with the virtual clinic to get that sorted out, are you trying to get your insurance figured out first."
13637.0,Patient,"I talked to them about the different things that we were trying and. Their response was, let us know whenever. You you know what is going to take place as far as insurance. So i'm just trying to. work overtime, because I didn't know it had lapsed until just a few days ago and um. let's see this is Thursday, I think it was Tuesday I knew and I just like panic thinking oh my God I can't. You know my situation right don't have access to. staying with us, you know so i'm working overtime on it."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good good i'm glad to hear that I know that can be stressful so deep breath through the process."
13637.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,and What else is going on with you anything else How are things at home.
13637.0,Patient,"Thanks i'm we're good um I have. I had kind of sweated our landlord had a wanted to do a walk through because our Lisa come up, and you know you're always concerned because you hear in the news that there are. billions of people looking for homes to rent and not enough Rentals and we like this House, and so I was really kind of stressing. Oh, what you know what's going to happen and they came through and they were very pleased and said we'd like you to stay, and so I was like who, you know that was another really."
148.0,Provider,yeah I love them good news lately. Good i'm glad to hear that.
13637.0,Patient,"yeah and my daughter. she's 25 I think she just turned she just turned just turned 26 but she's. A really I mean she probably was 98 pounds she's really tiny she's beautiful really long her. But she's very much to be very cautious and very tuned in to. Like the dangers of human trafficking sex trafficking that kind of stuff. It alarmed me she came to me a few months ago, and said that she had been. On this dating website. And this guy had wanted to come to town to meet her, and I just like I mean i'm the old school, you know i'm sorry but i'm. i'm not you guys that are younger I know that's normal I know a lot of people have success with it, but I just had this red flag that that I don't like this. But he came to town and he never once he didn't come to the door didn't meet any of my three sons and my husband's kind of he and I are kind of just. cohabitation because. You know if it weren't for financial reasons, we would be divorced, but i'm. three sons are my the men in my life, and so this guy he never once asked to meet her brothers he didn't ask to enter you know i'd like to introduce myself and let them know who's taking you to the zoo for the day so anyway, I let her do it um. And she came back, and you know she was safe and everything had gone well, but then. He had come from. His family was from North Carolina he had been married, but he said that his wife was an alcoholic and a druggie it had two little girls together, but he had almost full custody, he said that his mom and dad were both. alcoholics and drug addicts, so he had moved from North Carolina to the state of Washington. This is all in the span of six months, and then by the time that he came here to visit her he had moved from the state of Washington to Texas. Now I yeah I don't know if you're a mom or not, but for a mom, especially when i'm with kids my age i'm just too tuned anything I don't like the sound of this too much too much moving around too much you know I don't even know the guy. He had he got home to Texas, and like within a couple weeks, he wanted her to come visit him in Texas. And then she bought the tickets. without knowing without me knowing and I went to her, and I said I will I can't let you do this, and this is not safe i'm sorry. i'm your mom and I know legally, you can do it if you want, you can walk out that door, but you do not have the support of your brothers are I and so anyway, it was. Quite tumultuous um but she ended up canceling it and it. was quite a rough because then he was upset because you know he had had plans for her to come visit and now the only way she could go was if he came back here and met the family, so he did that."
148.0,Provider,Oh wow.
13637.0,Patient,"He only did it he did it for one day he spoke to the southern line that's the one that I trust the most he's in training to be a cop, and he asked, he was talking to him for maximum. Five seven minutes and the guy looked at him and he said how many more questions do you have ring. And that just my son just said in his mind, he said no that's it, this is not, I do not accept this, and so. The guy went home he flew back to Texas my daughter started making arrangements again Okay, you know he met your requirements. and We came, we had a joint meeting like an intervention with her and we said Alexis, this is not, this is, this is just ridiculous. yeah this. does not say. yeah you're wanting to leave San Diego and fly to Texas, and this guy doesn't even have five minutes to talk to your brother without gnostic so anyway, to make a long story short, she bought the tickets and she went to Texas."
148.0,Provider,Is she there now.
13637.0,Patient,"she's not there now she was there for five days when she got there, this is the weird weird part when she like every moms worst nightmare when she got to Texas. He it was time for his little daughters, to come back to him the mom has a report of the summer in North Carolina and then it was time for them to come back to him in Texas. She the mom was supposed to fly the little girls to him in Texas within 24 hours of my daughter touching down in Texas. She caught. Her ex husband said I can't drive to the airport that far so you're gonna have to drive to Alabama and pick them up so within 24 hours of my daughter landing. He put her in a car drove her to Texas Kentucky Illinois and Alabama. And my son's wore out of their head."
148.0,Provider,"We had as you, as you know everything that was going on."
13637.0,Patient,"She kept in contact with us. You know. play um we demanded to know license plate year everything of the color of the car the make the model, the year, yes, full name has the dress his social security number. Everything we just said you're going to keep driving where we need to know this or we're calling Ohio patrol um so she gave me the information thankfully. They picked a little girls up they made it back to Texas she had two days left there she came home, but thank God within three weeks of her coming home. He broke up with her. Because he said, the time there's two hours time difference and he said, the time difference and the. mile distance I don't think I can deal with. So he what he wanted was for her to come to Texas, he wanted to be engaged get engaged and get married and have her just move there."
148.0,Provider,And this is after knowing each other for just a few weeks.
13637.0,Patient,"No, they had been communicating for a while and by this time at the end of the relationship it had been about six months total. She came to me, but not quite five months into it, and she said i'm talking to this guy online and I said Alexis we go to a huge massive church and it's got all kinds of youth groups and and every age group and. I mean they meet every need whether it's divorce drug abuse. Group for every single age group, you want, and I said, why would you go online to somebody that you don't you don't know if he's telling you the truth. And so, anyway, she came back from a trip thankful all in one piece."
148.0,Provider,That yeah.
13637.0,Patient,"You know I said I mean I got real with her, and I said you're taking you're walking out my door. And I don't know if i'm going to find that you've been found branded you know how they get them and they brand them and they literally stick a prod in them to mark them and I said I don't want to get a package in the mail with your finger. I don't want something to happen to you, I mean wake up. yeah like thankfully, you know she thought she was in love and she thought he was a good guy and now she her eyes are open and so all this stuff my son's biopsy the. What was the other thing I mentioned Oh, the walkthrough in the rental. And in her breaking up with him all this is taking place in a matter of like three weeks, so I am just so relieved and so thankful. wow The last thing I want to do is get off track with with this suboxone and brighter thing so."
148.0,Provider,"isn't it funny how usually things come in threes too. But wow what a story i'm so glad that she's okay there's definitely yeah very, very scary very scary what's out there now with the online dating and you know lots of stranger stranger danger it's very."
13637.0,Patient,"And the weird thing is she is she's the worst about telling me i'm you know mom watch out you look over there, looks you know kind of sketchy if we're at a shopping Center or something or whatever she's the worst about being so tuned in. This just totally blew me away, and the fact that she got there. She arrived in Texas at midnight and he had her in his car within two hours headed to Alabama. And I said what more perfect scenario for human sex traffickers, then get somebody get them in a strange place middle of the night they're disoriented. They don't know where they're at they're not sure what state they've never even been to that state that the driving through they don't know where they're going. it's not familiar to them and they're just at the mercy of the person behind the wheel, you know it was just it was like a horse movie. So."
148.0,Provider,I can't even imagine the stress and the fear that you must have been feeling in that moment.
13637.0,Patient,yeah we were definitely up online and um. You know I mean. chase is he is that we're both two of my three boys of wanting to get into law enforcement chase has gone the farthest he's second in line to be hired next.
148.0,Provider,At.
13637.0,Patient,"A police department in San Diego here um he's more kind of be. he's very strong but very. kind of quiet and. he's very well spoken and presents himself, but he's not. A hothead um my oldest son is the kind that I mean he heard about it, and he was ready to. Get in the car and. drive to Alabama himself, you know I mean he was just like okay we're gonna go get him, you know so thankfully in I have. A balance to kind of you know okay let's just keep in touch with her chance to check in with us every hour just to tell us where she's at. We have to hear his voice in the background. You know, and thank God it turned out well."
148.0,Provider,And she she was able to do that.
13637.0,Patient,yeah she was able to do it.
148.0,Provider,Okay wow.

13637.0,Patient,"chase kept telling me is he's the youngest us, though I have my youngest to are trends and he is the youngest of the twin by one minute and. He kept saying to me mom just take a deep breath just you know, in your post out through your mouth just you know we're going to take care of it we're on top of it we're keeping with her. you're saying hey you know we're all. So."
148.0,Provider,"Important to stay grounded like that, because automatically your mind is going to going to want to go to the worst case scenario possible right. Oh well, I am really glad to hear that you are doing well, your son is doing well at your daughter's doing well and oh gosh yeah."
13637.0,Patient,"Thankfully, she has seen this guy for what he is. yeah she's her all her plans of you know i'm going to get engaged and move to Texas and get married and all that is out the door and we don't have to wonder about him anymore, because his stories just never point added up. yeah everything. Is kind of sketchy and the one thing that just that just sealed the deal for chase was to look at him. Five less than 10 minutes into the conversation and say how many more questions do you have for me. that's not what you say to you want to marry this girl. brother has just now met you and you don't you don't say that to the family."
148.0,Provider,So he only saw her the three times total when he came here twice and then she went there once.
13637.0,Patient,"um yeah he came here once we never saw him there couldn't didn't even know to look like. up in a. Car to the corner and she went out and got in, and that was it. yeah then he came back. unhappily yeah because he wanted to meet him first and that's when the little conversation took place with chase. yeah and then import chase the whole time he's going through this he he is in the middle of facing they've done the first endoscopy and they have found the spot. And now they're going to go in and do put him completely under and find out what it is and find out if it's cancer and he's dealing with that fear and the fear of his sister, and so you know he's a pretty tough kid you know the 20. You know."
