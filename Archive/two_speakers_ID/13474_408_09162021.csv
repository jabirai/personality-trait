13474.0,Patient,hi Hello.
408.0,Provider,Good to see good so. let's pick right up with our treatment protocol. you're going to select a mood log that you prefer and start recording on the CB team mood log and that was going to provide the data that we were going to pick up with at this session.
13474.0,Patient,Correct so I chose. A daily moods log that was created by David burns md.
408.0,Provider,very familiar with it.
13474.0,Patient,"Okay, so that's the one I created or. decided to use. So i've been keeping up with it, even though. Even though we missed our appointment on the 11th I missed the appointment. But. Where would you like me to start."
408.0,Provider,"So start where you started recording. And, or you can start with any patterns that you've observed now you've been keeping the log for a little bit for a while."
13474.0,Patient,"There okay so i'm. Really, no patterns, I would say, and. For the most part, most of my feelings have been. Out of anxiety and frustration, maybe. Specifically, because I lost my Internet. makes a big difference in how. How things go um. So let's go I guess i'll just go with the first week. So the 30th was a particularly frustrating day for me because that's the day I lost the Internet. So he has. cognitive distortions that he. Yes, he put in his. log its front and back so. I went ahead and I added some cognitive distortions that were positive as well. So he has can I added number 11 self worthiness. And that there is a Gray area, nothing is not necessarily ever black or white. I don't need to be perfect. That i'm hopeful and i'm helpful."
408.0,Provider,"So that would actually not be a distortion then would it. Right now be a positive belief system yeah or, in some cases, if it's a small self statement you could call it an affirmation. Sure track."
13474.0,Patient,"Number number two i'll just call it number two now i'm. Is that i'm content with my environment that it's adequate worthwhile and i'm conscious of my feelings um and then the third one is mindful and relaxed that I added that I have rational thinking that i'm worthy I make a difference, I take my time and I do it right, the first time. Okay."
408.0,Provider,"Oh wow if you do it right, the first time that's exceptional well. Most of us can't claim that."
13474.0,Patient,"Oh no but I try my work at it. um so. Going back to the date the 30th um my my positive thoughts were that I cannot control my actions of my environments, with the Internet company and that I contacted the Internet company. And they were going to try and restore and you're."
408.0,Provider,"Good so that I would have been the action so to use that cognitive behavioral conceptual theoretical framework, you would have the triggering context, which would have been the Internet breakdown. Then you would have a negative thought that would be associated with the frustration and. articulate the negative thought, what would that be."
13474.0,Patient,"um. Well, definitely that I was anxious because I thought well how am I going to. continue with my therapy."
408.0,Provider,"And I so you would then write that down as the thought that was linked to the situation that then could affect your mood adversely right we did so imagine feelings of frustration, so the thought that, oh no how am I going to do my therapy without Internet. For in terms of the cognitive distortion paradigm. You could. categorize that as disaster rising. Okay, or overgeneralization probably more disaster rising."
13474.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,"I did. The positive counter active state will be the one you just said. Exactly, and then the behavior then flowed from the positive restructuring of your attitude belief about the situation which led to the positive step, which was the solution to the problem right contacting the Internet company. Instead of leading to no solution other than a mood negative mood effect from the negative belief system with a cognitive distortion. mm hmm so that's how that mood log works to cue you to what some of the patterns might be that linked together right the triggering situation with the negative thoughts or distortion or belief system with a counter active restructuring thought or affirmation and then behavior."
13474.0,Patient,Right. Okay. um. So. Around.
408.0,Provider,"That time frame, what was the time frame, how many seconds, did you perhaps spend with the oh no disaster thought, and then the frustration, how would How would you estimate that time."
13474.0,Patient,"It was probably. Well, if it lasted the entire week."
408.0,Provider,"So make a note of that so for the mood log the timeframes important so that had an effect on your mood for the week and then, if you can rate, the level of the mood. On some kind of scale that's helpful. To so how frustrated worried."
13474.0,Patient,He has a percentage.
408.0,Provider,yeah.
13474.0,Patient,That wine as pretty pretty high 100% I was pretty frustrated.
408.0,Provider,So note that also with his percentage system since that's the mood log.
13474.0,Patient,"Okay, that you're using right and then my belief my percentage of belief, after. I rated about maybe 10%. After I recognized, you know what's what's causing this feeling of anxiety frustration little bit of anger, I guess, to. The so. yeah."
408.0,Provider,"And, and the Act on the action of substituting a more reasonable or positive thought and restructuring so cognitive restructuring right reduce the hundred percent, but it still kind of lasted for the week so then."
13474.0,Patient,"Lingering frustration well almost for two weeks, well, it was for two."
408.0,Provider,Okay.
13474.0,Patient,Because I had no wi fi no no Internet so.
408.0,Provider,"So that's important to make a note of, because then that gives us some. arrows or red flags in terms of what to work on. For for moving into the future, so, even though the actual context, meaning okay there's no Internet for two weeks. doesn't continue to negatively. to affect your mood negatively for the entire period of time."
13474.0,Patient,Right right.
408.0,Provider,See how that. points to setting some goals and strategies.
13474.0,Patient,"Yes, I like that okay okay um. That That was the first week. So the second week I I basically, I had a pretty pretty productive week they there was a. blurb on the seventh of September, because I missed my group, ladies group appointment and that of course increase the frustration in the in the anxiety. But that's an actual triggering event, just like the loss of the Internet."
408.0,Provider,"So you note that as the triggering context. So, in other words it's important. When we're looking for patterns, to which to develop and apply strategies to note trigger the type of trigger sometimes they can be an internal Pew like pain. Okay, sometimes it can be an external event. missing an appointment and then you look at Okay, so what was the cause of the external event, if I can figure out a cause so in this case, what was the cause of missing the appointment."
13474.0,Patient,It was not having the Internet.
408.0,Provider,"There you go so then once you write that down, then you say Okay, so this has a feedback loop. That yeah. When I first lost the Internet."
13474.0,Patient,"Yes. Definitely. i'm just writing some notes down. Yes, me, I mean."
408.0,Provider,"that's what the process is exactly. So then, if you realize that there's starting to be a pattern here. In terms of causality or, of course, in your field medical field we call it etiology right. yep so that's the pattern so cool so can we brainstorm options for problem solutions to the pattern. Right and, in this case, it was an external trigger it was a life of that with an external trigger and if. You and I have. touched on this before and sometimes there is no but solution. But let's touch on it again so when you realize, you have a connectivity problem of which you are oh very, very aware."
13474.0,Patient,very aware.
408.0,Provider,"yeah what what are your options, if you know you have an appointment coming up by Tele health. What could be some options, if you know you don't have current connectivity where you are."
13474.0,Patient,um well I did I did definitely call and and.
408.0,Provider,cancel number one.
13474.0,Patient,And I continue with mine my cvt logs because I think that's important.
408.0,Provider,continue your work right because again much of therapy work is what you're doing.
13474.0,Patient,Right right.
408.0,Provider,"And what. Is there a different location, you could try to go to to brainstorm where there might be better connectivity."
13474.0,Patient,"and Possibly yes, I get, I guess, I could have driven up to. think the dunkin donuts has. Has wi fi so I I could have done that."
408.0,Provider,"That is what some bright heart health patients clients do is they, particularly in rural areas, like the one you're in is they figure out where the hotspots and they actually drive to the hotspot when they have a problem, and they do their session from the car."
13474.0,Patient,uh huh.
408.0,Provider,"Now you don't want you driving during recession, but if you're parked yeah you can do it from the car, as long as you have privacy."
13474.0,Patient,Okay okay so that's a good problem.
408.0,Provider,But option one option.
13474.0,Patient,I didn't really think about that until now. That I I probably could have done that.
408.0,Provider,"So that's part of this pattern pattern recognition process with cpt that we get used with the evidence from the mood law. So that if you do see any kind of pattern either in solutions or or triggers right life event triggers or patterns in the nature of belief systems or cognitive distortions that drive. Negative mood right. Yes, and then we're coming up with more and more effective tools to deal with the recurring patterns. dunkin donuts yeah write that down."
13474.0,Patient,You gotta grab a pop. or I guess.
408.0,Provider,"Well, this is likely to be a recurring theme Now the question is, do you have to inside dunkin donuts or can you sit in your car in the parking spot."
13474.0,Patient,I can I don't know I.
408.0,Provider,"will try it out. try it out. because, obviously, if you. can't access connectivity unless you're indoors, then you can't do that because there's no privacy. Exactly, but in many cases wi fi, for example, from a public library. And I suspect from dunkin donuts does extend to the immediate parking lot."
13474.0,Patient,"I would, I would suspect that it does."
408.0,Provider,"So try it out so that would be homework. Okay, you know drive out to dunkin donut sometime and test it out before the next group session. So there's the homework for the week. Now other options are there other hotspots around your area like the public library."
13474.0,Patient,"up there is a public library, I have not been to it um but it's it's close enough to where I could get to it. should be Internet go out, you know, suddenly, or something so i'll check that out as well."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, I know that nationwide many public libraries. checked with during a covert shutdowns when they the inside of the library was actually shut down and they were only doing curbside delivery and pickup. They checked to make sure that their wi fi was available in the parking lot and they actually put big signs out and say you can still use our wi fi in the parking lot, which is. a wonderful I love public libraries right it's a wonderful community service."
13474.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely."
408.0,Provider,yeah there is.
13474.0,Patient,A library yay for the library.
408.0,Provider,i'm having my moment of gratitude for public libraries right.
13474.0,Patient,"Exactly. Exactly. Okay, so that'll be part of my homework too i'll make a little tour of the tour of the town. and see."
408.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah finding the other brainstorming option is what would you do if you had something happens and you can't anticipate soon enough to get to drive out to the hotspot or your translate to transportation is unavailable, for whatever reason."
13474.0,Patient,"i'm. that's a good question I go back to you know, making a call to let someone know."
408.0,Provider,yeah. yeah.
13474.0,Patient,Okay. Good okay.
408.0,Provider,"Good and. Are there any other brainstorming options in terms of how soon you would know ahead of time about the connectivity, so you would have time to drive to a hotspot if you lose the Internet, where you are."
13474.0,Patient,Sure i'm checking in well ahead of my appointment time I think would be a good option.
408.0,Provider,Good so what driving time are we allowing.
13474.0,Patient,"Oh, goodness, it takes me a half an hour to get to town. Where i'm at."
408.0,Provider,which would include both the library and the dunkin donuts.
13474.0,Patient,"Yes, they're pretty close to each other."
408.0,Provider,So you need to probably check your Internet productivity 45 minutes ahead of an appointment.
13474.0,Patient,"Maybe, yes, which I did today. yay yay. For our I have I just mowed an acre and a half of my yard so. Congratulations, thank you."
408.0,Provider,"You had your time out in the sun. Light yet in your retinas which we know it, the UV light hitting the retina I usually it's more effective earlier in the day, so before noon your time does have a measurable effect on sleep quality. Absolutely advice and we've known that for a while. But the fun part is now we've had an accumulation of robust studies that have demonstrated that. incense interrupted sleep and insomnia, and poor sleep latency tends to go along with Depression and anxiety it's important to know that."
13474.0,Patient,"Yes, which is why I always encourage my patients to make sure that they go outside and take a walk outside and i'm because I thought it would help."
408.0,Provider,"And you are quite correct the evidence isn't as and, as proven you right and also we found more interestingly to in terms of a nuance to that is the newer research is testing whether, for example, for, say nursing home patients. Whether wheeling them to a window. That has good morning sunlight exposure will. be equally effective so far, the preliminary studies are suggesting yes."
13474.0,Patient,hi.
408.0,Provider,So if you can't get outside get to a window.
13474.0,Patient,In a window.
408.0,Provider,"uh huh and the other point I like to underscore to is horticultural therapy is a real thing as far as an adjunct uncomplimentary intervention. that used to be primarily the domain of occupational therapists but now psychotherapists all have enough evidence based age started to use adapted protocols. The gardener's among us have a little advantage in terms of wellness. Exactly and that appears to be part of it is a. Physical ability, but part of it seems to be the sunlight."
13474.0,Patient,"Sure, I I totally feel better. Once i've been out and have mowed the yard I my husband made wanted to buy one of those zero turn mowers and I kind of balked at that for a while, but."
408.0,Provider,uh huh.
13474.0,Patient,"When it was taking me, six, seven hours. To mow the yard. I said I finally gave in, but I still hand mo and I liked the exercise that it gives me. As well as you know, the ability. To I so yeah that's."
408.0,Provider,"know, like so many complimentary and adjunct interventions that are now being studied for to tease out the mechanism of effect. And we're finding that horticultural therapy like say yoga or TAI Chi appears to have Multifactorial. Mechanisms right like you're just saying so, one is the physical activity, so the so exercise has been known for a long time to have benefits for Depression and anxiety, the other peers, to be now be the light. Exposure, particularly since gardeners like to go out in the morning before it gets hot. Exactly turns out to be the ideal time. To get sunlight on your retina. And then there also appears to be, and this is not as strongly supported yet by the evidence, but there appears to be an independent. effect for the variable of nature exposure whether this has to do with something about oxygenation even if we're not physically active whether it has to do with aesthetics something calling about. visually or a factory or auditory early you see and i'm saying taking in the nick that the traits are the characteristics of outdoors. is not yet clear but that's very interesting."
13474.0,Patient,"I I would firmly believe that. Being outdoors I mean, I know I feel a sense of calm when I can go outdoors or at least go to a window see my birds. feeding. The hummingbirds specifically."
408.0,Provider,they're beautiful.
13474.0,Patient,They just they and they make me laugh they they let me know when they're feeders are empty they come to the window and.
408.0,Provider,and saying hi.
13474.0,Patient,"And they they say. Hello and. chirp at me so i'm that and. I take my dogs for box back in the woods, so not only am I hearing the birds i'm hearing the wind blowing through the pine trees i'm hearing. The sounds of possibly other animals i'm looking for. searching for signs of deer and other animals flying out, so I think that that certainly is. A great deal of therapy."
408.0,Provider,And what's what are you smelling on those walks.
13474.0,Patient,"Oh, goodness the ball some smell and the smell of the woods and it is it's all very positive to me."
408.0,Provider,"And there's probably in some some days, depending on the word probably an earthy smell."
13474.0,Patient,"yeah yeah bossy birthday. Right boss mafia and, yes, definitely. yeah."
408.0,Provider,"So yes, so, as you probably know, we do guided visualizations for relaxation exercises that do just that, a walk through the forest and the imaginary multi sensory. perceptions right of the walk. Through the forest."
13474.0,Patient,hmm. I have that way.
408.0,Provider,"There you go good good good so if it's a rainy day or you know, whatever whether you can do it through your imagination and it lights up the same areas of the brain."
13474.0,Patient,Very cool.
408.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13474.0,Patient,I like that a lot. So okay.
408.0,Provider,Good good now one of the other triggers that you said that was internal and i'm wondering if you happen to have any of these occur that were reported on your mood log was sometimes internal negative thoughts about someone you're interacting with or having a relationship with.
13474.0,Patient,"I was that so you're on in the week, and it would have been the day prior to. Our originally scheduled meeting. My husband was. Well okay let's see without going into a lot of detail, he was taking a seat eloping and he winked he weaned off of it. As he was having problems with anxiety as well. Maybe a little depression for. me he he left his he retired from his position as an airline pilot which he had done for. 3032 years."
408.0,Provider,wow big big change.
13474.0,Patient,"big change big change in life. positively, but also the negative. portion applying so anyway."
408.0,Provider,And these aviators love to fly. Oh yashin with these folks.
13474.0,Patient,"It certainly is and we have a little plant, not a little plane, we have a Cessna. yeah I when he the reason that he was. coming off of the seat of low pram is because the FAA says, you cannot have medical clearance unless you."
408.0,Provider,Ryan.
13474.0,Patient,"For off of certain medications. And he was feeling frustrated angry sad maybe I don't i'm not sure exactly what his feelings were at the time, but when I was most when I had mode last week. He yelled at me for for something i'm not yelled but was like whoa that was kind of a dumb thing to have done."
408.0,Provider,He was he was.
13474.0,Patient,"very quick and he he's definitely a very critical person as you might imagine a pilot would be. uh huh and very OCD so. I. should have stick. Yes, yes, very much so so um you know my emotional reasoning kicked in I feel stupid about this i'm sorry I must be stupid and. Maybe I should have done it a different way or auto have done it a different way and. labeling instead of saying hey look I make made a mistake i'm i'm totally you know, a loser are totally stupid, you know."
408.0,Provider,So the cognitive distortion was easily identified as labeling.
13474.0,Patient,"Absolutely absolutely labeling should have. emotional reason, but my positive thoughts were hey the lawn looks beautiful. I was able to get on this new tractor and most straight lines, so I defy you to go ahead and do that the first time. And that you know everyone makes mistakes."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so these were. cognitive reframing using realistic self statements, even though some of them are a little angry."
13474.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,or defensive.
13474.0,Patient,defensive maybe yes.
408.0,Provider,"Right. But endeavor reasonable you're pointing out contradictions, to the criticism that were objective objective measurable another strategy that for these internal thoughts obviously thought stopping for the labeling. For the negative, you know internalizing the criticism into labeling so imagine a big red stop sign. You know, stop. This is another person's statement that's an evaluation. it's simply a reflection of their view, not mine."
13474.0,Patient,got it.
408.0,Provider,"So that means you're taking a step back your distancing and saying Okay, this is feedback. It wasn't delivered in a very helpful way, but it is feedback and I can consider it as such. Okay, which. means when I consider it, I have the power to. dismiss it as not correct. Which is some of what you did with your contradiction self statements or I could say, maybe there's a grain of something in there, that would be useful."
13474.0,Patient,mm hmm.
408.0,Provider,Okay i'm going to take the useful grain. and decide to ignore the rest are set aside the rest and not allow it to affect my well being.
13474.0,Patient,got it.
408.0,Provider,I have the power to do that.
13474.0,Patient,Like that's good. stuff okay.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, good good good. Not that it's easy right now that is easy."
13474.0,Patient,"it's it's not easy and. I used to be pretty good at that and and. Okay, I just I just was so. beat down that I let him get away with speaking to me, you know you're acting upon his thoughts and thinking that he appeared here, you know. that's that's good."
408.0,Provider,"And it's also a very useful. retrospective observation that this is a set of skills that actually in the past, you have pretty highly developed how to deal with criticism so um you know what that looks like and feels like which will help you. bounce back to that level."
13474.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay that's good. Okay, and then. me as well get to this one. This this site, I really need some help where i'm so. Given the St the low pram and so forth. So he he every year every year of an airplane has to go through annual inspection. The annual inspection had to be done down in another town about a half an hour's drive for me, but about a 10 minute flight for him, so he flew the airplane. down to the to the inspector, and this was on Sunday this past Sunday and I drove well when I got to him well, even before I got to him, he called me and said look I I had an accident with the plane."
408.0,Provider,Oh no.
13474.0,Patient,"At a crosswind now when he says, I had an accident with the plane, of course, i'm thinking, the worst case scenario. feel very anxious and. You know automatically anxious worried. so forth."
408.0,Provider,How would you put that into a thought statement.
13474.0,Patient,"um my thought was. i'm. Oh, my God. What happened and. My negative thought was oh my God i'm thinking, the worst that could happen is he hurt."
408.0,Provider,Okay. Okay. And how much did you believe it was likely that he was hurt at that.
13474.0,Patient,About. Maybe 5%.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so you weren't. told me, it was a. doctor, he was."
13474.0,Patient,He was able to. call me and talk to me so when you.
408.0,Provider,counted like he sounded like himself.
13474.0,Patient,"He he sounded very worried. Ah, very. worried very anxious because he was afraid that the plane was. And he did damage. Saying this, he did damage to light on the runway."
408.0,Provider,"Dear. Yes, and let's go back to your negative thought and one of the strategies we use and cvt is the downward arrow. Okay right so that is done to dig underneath the surface thought to see what lies beneath whether there might be some kind of belief system or worldview that fuels the intensity of the negative thought or the disaster is them. Okay, so that negative thought oh my God. He might be hurt he's hurt. underneath that. What, what do you identify when you think about that."
13474.0,Patient,i'm. In.
408.0,Provider,Your beliefs about flying planes your husband. Anything for general.
13474.0,Patient,"Okay, so in a more general way, I know that as a. As a pilot the possible things and the ripple effect that this could have. For him so. Could it mess up you know. Could could it cause him to have problems later on. Re rethinking the whole scenario, and how does that impact me and in his behavior how is his behavior going to impact me."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, and what's underneath that."
13474.0,Patient,what's underneath that. is like.
408.0,Provider,Other assumptions about. ways that his behavior might affect you in that case or their assumptions. or worldviews okay go ahead with those.
13474.0,Patient,"So there's assumptions that he's going to be. How do I say this, and that his mood will be. distorted and you know feeling. Negative that he's he's scored a negative."
408.0,Provider,and assumptions about how that would affect you.
13474.0,Patient,And it's going to make me feel anxious. hopeless frustrated. Maybe even inferior.
408.0,Provider,what's underneath that.
13474.0,Patient,kind of inadequate and unable to be. help to him. That feeling feeling unable to help him. I guess that's the way I was looking at that.
408.0,Provider,So is there an underlying belief system that you own other people's feelings.
13474.0,Patient,"No. No, but. Do I impact them. negatively, by how I react to his be papier. Maybe is how I was feeling. And my claws. As my behavior causing his behavior to become worse."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, you mean related to all those stress transition stresses that you all are undergoing okay."
13474.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. Yes. So. That that leads me to. worrying about him. And worried about how. he's going to feel. And my response to him after after I had gotten him home and we had talked about things and. rehashed the whole situation."
408.0,Provider,"May I ask you to back up a minute here, I think I lost something in the train of events. So what happened to the inspection appointment."
13474.0,Patient,"Oh well. Basically, he was just dropping the plane off so. There was no one there at the time. So he did call the inspector and let him know you know what happened. So they didn't get to take a look at the plane until the next day. So when they did take a look at the plane he of course he's doing all of these things like Dreading the outcome of. What he might have done to the plane, how much it's going to cost to fix it should be fix it should we should we sell the plane, should we, you know all of these are going through his mind and i'm thinking well. You know a lot of that I I can't control how he feels but my suggestion to him was after discussing it for a while, was. You know you seem really down and depressed by this even into the next day. Would it be something to consider to go back on the seat of low Program. and"
408.0,Provider,Or does he have as a retiree does he have employee assistance program benefits that he could just process this with a therapist.
13474.0,Patient,"Well, he does have that, but he comes from the belief system that, even though I he encouraged me to get therapy for my issues he doesn't believe in therapy for himself so."
408.0,Provider,"Well it's not exactly a belief system, it is a an intervention that has scientific evidence to support."
13474.0,Patient,"hey. He doesn't think that that's, something that would help him and so."
408.0,Provider,"Even if it is, is there a pilot's union or professional organization."
13474.0,Patient,therapist there's.
408.0,Provider,"I thought so. So I wonder if for retirees they might have some kind of class or mentoring or group or something that wouldn't sound like therapy that sounds like a here's how you make a transition to still being able to fly in retirement as you age, you see what i'm saying."
13474.0,Patient,yeah I did.
408.0,Provider,"which really is there, but Okay, you know. Right, maybe not with a trained therapist but at least maybe it would be peer you know, like peer mutual support or something like that. yeah would you go Would he be more likely to go for that."
13474.0,Patient,"He would be more likely to go for that and, of course, he has. Millions millions, but multiple. pilot. crowing."
408.0,Provider,"buddy sure, but he's not likely to want to. share it off disclosure yes about that, whereas a bit more formal program was strangers he might feel less inhibited about self disclosure."
13474.0,Patient,"Certainly, certainly, and I I would think that. This event. I with. him, he would probably be more prone to generalize it as hey I know this person who had this accident or this occurrence, with their airplane. Well, you know yeah yeah. Absolutely."
408.0,Provider,that's just my. Actually doesn't work but OK.
13474.0,Patient,So. I I suspect that would be the way he would handle something like that.
408.0,Provider,"Or, there may even be if they have some kind of. Like online class or whatever it might even be that he's simply he could take the stance that he's proactively. Wanting to inform themselves about what to do in case something like this happens. or two or something you know what i'm saying a hypothetical hypothetical not my friend did this, but an actual i'm taking this class proactively."
13474.0,Patient,mm hmm so. Maybe I could have suggested. That he get on the Internet and. Look at what happened. Study some case studies that caused the same occurrence with someone else and. So that he. Not beating himself up.
408.0,Provider,"basic right first he probably should go on his professional associations website and look under retirees and see if there's some kind of class or group that talks about transitioning because this may only be the first such events or challenge. not the last. are not the only so i'm not sure a case study approaches. I mean, I understand where you're coming from by suggesting that but he might be diluting himself if he starts with that."
13474.0,Patient,that's a good point that's a very good point okay.
408.0,Provider,"Because this is a live stage transition. yeah around a set of very high level occupational skills. Yes, exactly now transitioning to as a hobby."
13474.0,Patient,"mm hmm yes exactly no longer an occupation, but a hobby. Yes, and what was. What was really kind of a downer to was. We were able. couple days prior to that maybe three or four days prior to that we were able to get both dogs into the plane. And we flew for probably an hour with the dogs in the plane and they were so well behaved and we were thinking Well now, we can now we're not tied down, we can take the dogs with us. uh huh he."
408.0,Provider,"is interesting it's interesting this me Kelly. i'll share with you one thought I had when you set up the scenario and I knew it had been some kind of negative event and you said, and I was driving. And my immediate thought, but I didn't actually say it yet was, I wonder if you took one of the dogs you both the dogs in the car with you, because this is likely to be a stressful situation for your spouse. Yes, so in future that that might be your support system."
13474.0,Patient,And they are they're huge support system. So yeah so.
408.0,Provider,When when bad things might happen with your spouse about something about a something that means so much to him and there's so loaded for him. it's a tough one.
13474.0,Patient,"yeah this is this was pretty this was very big for him, but um we found out that there's no damage to the plane."
408.0,Provider,Oh wow yes.
13474.0,Patient,"amazing how he was able to roll. The plane, with the wind gusts blowing the wing up and. able to not cause any damage to the plane so."
408.0,Provider,It was possible to hit a light.
13474.0,Patient,Well it's just he just nicked it. With the edge of the wing. So I it's it's hard for me to. describe it is flying and flying and flying in and the the gust of wind hit him he had a crosswind so this end of the Wayne just tipped that. That light. wow look at it.
408.0,Provider,And it didn't even leave a scratch on the wing.
13474.0,Patient,It left a small scratch.
408.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13474.0,Patient,"All right, okay."
408.0,Provider,That makes more sense. But wow. yeah without missing a bullet.
13474.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely definitely so we've discussed. Things that he can do to avoid accidents like this happening again. One would be. not flying into. A situation where there are cross wins. Making sure that whether favor of. Your own and probably landing on a grass strip instead of the paper so."
408.0,Provider,Okay did that seem to help.
13474.0,Patient,"Yes, it helped tremendously."
408.0,Provider,"Oh good good good. yeah good. Very good, well it's time for us to wrap up this session and set our next appointment. And of course I think we've already discussed some of the. Actions, you can take practice strategies and to use explore optional solutions to triggering events, between now and our next session in a couple of weeks. So um."
13474.0,Patient,I actually have an appointment set with you on the 30th.
408.0,Provider,"Yes. Good we're good to go, then. All right."
13474.0,Patient,All right.
408.0,Provider,good job.
13474.0,Patient,"Thank you. All right, you too."
