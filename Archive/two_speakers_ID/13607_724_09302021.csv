ID,Role,Message
724.0,Provider,hey Veronica. That was that was. dicey.
13607.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. I wasn't sure if I was in the right one cuz. I remember it said something about Charles on the. email, but then on your thing it says check. yep some like my in the wrong one, no, no that's me I go bye bye goodbye chuck. yep well."
724.0,Provider,"I apologize for that that. Sometimes, like sessions like that will unpack some stuff that that we're not necessarily ready to do in an hour time frame and then it gets it gets dicey so."
13607.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"I reached out to the care of and I don't know if they got back to you, but I was like hey i'm wrapping the session up but it might be like a few more minutes and. Okay."
13607.0,Patient,"I just wasn't sure I was in the right spot, so I was like what do I do so I can work. there's nothing else I was like i'll just go back to that one see what happens."
724.0,Provider,"Good i'm glad because I would have felt like. trash about that. alright. So well you look better. Yes, did you get the medication all that kind of stuff yeah."
13607.0,Patient,"All right, good yeah for the most part yeah medication she she got on it, and I was able to get it so. doing better yeah it's crazy how. That stuff not having it messes you up."
724.0,Provider,"No oh good oh. Did they respond like quickly was there, did you have to wait too much longer or did you get to."
13607.0,Patient,"watch the next day. And no I actually had to wait a little bit, but um. I don't know it was it was just like shanteau finally put me in that group, so I started on Friday. Having the group meetings. And she said, maybe, that was an issue. That I didn't have a group to be in so she could be prescribing me i'm the medication and."
724.0,Provider,that's a problem.
13607.0,Patient,"And then the pharmacy, of course. yeah so we'll see what happens now, but so far i'm okay yeah."
724.0,Provider,"So so typically now like now that you're in the group. During the group setting chantelle because I do two groups with her on Tuesday. And every providers different so every group is going to have a therapist in it and a provider either a medical doctor or a nurse practitioner and that's what chantelle is so she's a psych nurse practitioner, which is awesome but. I don't want to say the shockers aren't good but I i've worked with psych. nurse practitioners and PS and they're awesome. Because they start out at like. You know ground level. trenches they've worked their way up and she's very experienced he's been doing this for a long time and she's worked in. All types of settings I think she's like one of the medical directors over at. crossroads, which is in. California to so she knows her, she knows her stuff. yeah she's good and so during this session, initially, like in the beginning. she'll be like yeah if you have medication stuff shoot me like a private chat so make sure like there's like the chat box in here, you know the bottom of the screen there's a drop down box, make sure you send it to chantelle and not to like everybody else in the group."
13607.0,Patient,People do that oh yeah.
724.0,Provider,And she'll get your medication like squared away and she sends it off to like the pharmacy like then so she's she's pretty thorough. And yeah she's good so.
13607.0,Patient,"i'm glad that's good. yeah yeah it's a new thing I did I was not able to function, I was like oh my God, what is this, it was."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, not to say that you looked her up, but I can tell you were like. You were struggling to keep it."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Well that's good i'm glad that worked out for you, because I didn't get an email, so I assume that everything had. yeah so no I mean it was gonna be out of your control anyway."
13607.0,Patient,"Because of the pharmacy they were going to get the medication until later that afternoon. Okay, well then yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Okay. Now I know, last time we talked we we talked about potentially spacing. Those is. out, just in case there's you know any kind of issues moving forward in pharmacies, there are issues, there are issues always would supply student with supply chain and stuff not being up to date, or one number being off event. You know yeah vs doesn't want to fill it like. They have all the they have their regulations we have ours, and then you know you and I were all stuck in the middle of. yeah so. On your end I just advocate that. If you're super disciplined where you're like nope I wake up, I take it, and then at 12 I take it, regardless if I need it or not, so I just tell people to. don't take the second dose or the third though some people aren't like three times of day space them out long enough to take them when you when you physically feel like you'd be that."
13607.0,Patient,Not yeah based on your schedule and of time.
724.0,Provider,"Right, we really don't necessarily need it right now, but on my clock, I have to do it so just space it out, because eventually like over time you'll start accumulating like little extras that's like a nice little cushion in case you. Yes, i'll just buy you a little bit of time in case there is a delay, for whatever reason."
13607.0,Patient,what's your experience on. on how people could do that just windows. A day or two things.
724.0,Provider,Like coming off of a dose or.
13607.0,Patient,"yeah Well, no, no, like like like spacing it out."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so people's discomfort level is always going to be subjective right so like your threshold. discomfort might be more or less than the next person so it's always hard to tell, so what I encourage people is one keep a journal. And just keep track of like how much really it's like for the daily journal should be like how much sleep did I get how much water did I just today. And what did I eat because those three factors are really important for how your body's going to respond okay. Those things are really, really important to deal with with opiates it's important that you hydrate gatorade water pedialyte that kind of stuff because opiates pull water away and D. Which is why people get constipated so it's really important that you're hydrating. A little bit more than normal. sleep is super important obviously. Which is hard to do in your case because you got. But sleep is very important. and certain days. You might feel better than others, just because you got adequate sleep versus all there, so you can't be like today, I feel like straight shit is like wise like On top of that, I only slept for hours and it's like."
13607.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Exactly your heads, going to be in the right place all so those little details and have what you ate you know eating healthy or healthy as possible. is important because the carb heavy foods starches your body is going to be dragging."
13607.0,Patient,You down again.
724.0,Provider,you'll feel lethargic anyways and the medication tends to make people feel lethargic anyway so that's not a good metric so sleep water and food.
13607.0,Patient,Keep that job at a time.
724.0,Provider,"So I take my first those whatever the milligram is 2468 whatever it is. And then i'll wait so say I dose twice a day theoretically you'd want to take one dose for 12 hours of your second dose would cover the other 12 hours that we have 24 hours of coverage right. Maybe maybe that works. But maybe you take that first dose and then at the 12 hour, mark you still feel pretty good. necessarily need it, but i'm getting tired so maybe I should take and get my coverage so then at that point, I would be like when you wake up. wait a little bit longer until you need it."
13607.0,Patient,mm hmm.
724.0,Provider,"Start experiencing some onset of withdrawal symptoms and not not like the second that your skin gets itchy or you get a little flustered. i'd add 30 minutes to that because the onset like the the mental game is like oh scrambled Tom idea that i'm starting to feel like crap I needed I needed i'd wait about 15 to 30 minutes because it's going to take about 15 to 30 to kick in. So start challenging your body, a little bit. she's eventually the goal should be to come off of this stuff you. start getting use of minor discomfort anyways. yeah what a practice now. And just get a ratchet starts training, the body of all so that's what I would do I would push it out until I started to feel like okay I should probably take it now right not not not the initial but okay I played it long enough i'm going to take it, and then write down the time. and, eventually, you might get into like like a rhythm to where it's like. You know 10 and 10 is easier to manage because i'd be like oh i'll stay up another hour and then i'll take it, and then. i've been turned to the 12 and 12 now you're now you're looking at. stretching at first those out for 14 to 16 hours. yeah if you have to set an alarm to wake. up briefly to take it to fall back asleep that's fine too, but eventually you get to the point to where it's like i'm good for 24 hours on a single dose. and Just do the same thing again. Cut that dose in half, and then space it out, you know, some people are like they absolutely need to dose up heavy. The first half of the day, and then, when they get home and relax it kick your feet up and not too worried about it and then they'll dose light at the end of the night know some people work. Jobs and then they're like I absolutely need to be able to function, I work 12 hours a day. High stress environment, I need to dose heavy somewhat heavier so I haven't coverage for my shift, at least so you get the medications to play around a little bit with it to see where you're at and the journal helps you keep track of those things. So that's always my recommendation. it's been my experience in the past, dealing with people that are coming off of the methadone medication and then, when we transfer them to the suboxone they normally exit the program completely within like three to six months. You know they're not right now. In that that setting they get a lot more practice with coping skills, we have a lot more time, especially when they're on methadone to make sure that they're working you know environmental factors so. Good relationships good coping skills good support network. they're working they're not couchsurfing you know they got stable resident everything is going pretty good for them. they're not acting like the behavior anymore have somebody. who's completely dependent they're just they got their life back on track and they're just maintenance and it's just i'm back to being a being a human being. You know i'm not hanging out those those circles anymore i'm. Just keeping it moving. yeah suboxone the interactions decrease, you know with the the therapist and the groups, all that kind of stuff they check in once a. week and they're just like regular people you would never be able to tell right that's like the goal yeah lots of people on all kinds of medication and sometimes you can't tell. And that's the point. So they're pretty good, and it will start tapering off doing exactly what I what I recommend it, though they'll play with their dose and then figure out where they're at where they need to put it. it's like a little bit of a science fair project for them and then they get to a point where they're managing and and then they decrease to do over again, and then they decrease and typically when people get down to like two milligrams or four milligrams they just walked off. You know it's i've done it was like nice to meet you good to like i'll deal with a minor withdrawal symptoms for the next two days but i'm."
13607.0,Patient,Like I don't want to come back and do this much.
724.0,Provider,More. So yeah it's like a lot of those people never hit zero. You know 12 can a 642 1.5 and never got to that point like I would see people walk off anywhere from two to four milligrams so just like the i'm good.
13607.0,Patient,Oh wow i'll do it feeling like crap for two hours.
724.0,Provider,For the next.
13607.0,Patient,My main thing is like anxiety. Is read like it readable that I can't control my anger that's where I it's hard for me more than. Just chill cold sweat I still deal with a bit. But the irritability and. anxiety.
724.0,Provider,"So be anxiety comes from a place, especially when it comes to medication. is like a control thing we feel safe, because we have it's like the phone like you ever like leave your House and, like go to the store and not. Doing. This we're conditioned to have it all the time it's the same thing with the medicaid same thing with everything right. And don't have that it's going to create anxiety so that's not an abnormal response it's a conditioned response because we rely on these things right."
13607.0,Patient,Because the.
724.0,Provider,"But if I took this phone and I just put it someplace for an hour out of sight out of mind i'm starting to train my body to not always my phone with my phone. I mean little things like that and that's why, when you start. Managing your medication, you probably not going to have a lot of anxiety and why, would you right. Yes, it would be minor. But it's additional yourself to manage that, through developing coping skills."
13607.0,Patient,How do you miss.
724.0,Provider,"I don't deal with not having my phone for an hour, you know, for five minutes, but I wish it was my father my is over there i'm over it, I got anxious for a moment identified it, but I moved on. and eventually you won't have excited about walking off on medication, or you know not taking any more because you're already training yourself to live without it. Okay incremental and then over time, thanks, a lot, you know. The first day is it's hard but three weeks later i'm putting my phone away for an hour I put it away for four hours now it's like whatever."
13607.0,Patient,Like it's like I don't need yeah.
724.0,Provider,"twice a day now it's not a big deal right it doesn't want to go to bed I make. Sure, the zombie apocalypse hasn't. hasn't started with my day my day and then i'm good to go so that's what you that's what we're doing we're working on developing coping strategies and skills by minor soldier tasks. Minor challenges right so that's that the irritability those are physical symptoms and then again, those are going to be responses to not having the thing. But you've already started to train yourself to not have that thing so that to goes away right."
13607.0,Patient,So.
724.0,Provider,As a symptom of. You know.
13607.0,Patient,The hot and cold flashes I.
724.0,Provider,can't control that you know what I mean like. yeah you just take a hot shower which are drink some gate array and take a tylenol for the fever and then you know manage that you know you keep you keep. The mental game is what we what we work hard on and that takes a little bit of practice and the only way to practice is to practice so torture yourself just a little bit every day.
13607.0,Patient,And it gets.
724.0,Provider,"easier, every day, just like progression of us, you know, most people didn't start out shooting heroin into their into their neck, you know when they became an opiate dependence attic right she started out small it took all kill it took a pill and a half, two pills. To me so there's a progression. So just like you're walking up. You know walk back down."
13607.0,Patient,And it's not.
724.0,Provider,"you're not jumping off Everest it takes a while to get the average it takes the same amount of time to get back down, you can just like okay i'm here good."
13607.0,Patient,yeah. Right so yeah.
724.0,Provider,"It takes time and you just have to challenge yourself a little bit every day, and then, when you you look at it as a cumulative mass it's a lot. You know, every six months of torture yourself for 30 minutes, every day, like do the math you know that's."
13607.0,Patient,That turns into days which.
724.0,Provider,"is often routine now and an ability to enter and all that kind of good stuff so. So boxes beautiful because it's your program to manage. yeah that's what I liked about it it's like, if you take your meds like yeah i'm like are you taking it as prescribed and like yeah I was like Okay, how do you feel like good I take it, sometimes I miss Jones i'm like whatever i'm not desperate not freaking out about too much. I get home from work and I. Take it on good."
13607.0,Patient,So yeah.
724.0,Provider,So you're acting like an adult right. yeah perfect you know I mean like it's it's your protocol and we don't. Agencies don't get on your case about what times are taking it do they like the doctor is not being like hey what time you take your.
13607.0,Patient,First yeah and then your second those.
724.0,Provider,"You know it's not like like the. methadone program was like you've got four hours to get your ass here take your dough so that we. We check off with time, every day, so like when they don't show up at 930 it's like we're all they. Are they all doing bad or they hurt."
13607.0,Patient,And yeah.
724.0,Provider,deal but.
13607.0,Patient,I knew that was like that bad like the methadone was like hardcore like that.
724.0,Provider,"it's pretty hardcore but. That that population needs that kind of stability, they need that accountability, they need to be there every day because there is active addiction, a lot of people still use it, excuse me. On methadone so suboxone is for the people that really have their shit together. that's What matters, you know what I mean like that's what matters not everybody qualifies for suboxone um."
13607.0,Patient,How do you guys. decide.
724.0,Provider,"yeah exactly what we do you know people call and we screen and then. You know if we just we feel like their environmental factors are stable like we don't want to give them a controlled substance of they're going to turn around and sell on the street and help pay for rent or pay for their high speed cars and all that kind of stuff. yeah like and. When we screen people that my previous clinic and the screening process i'm sure similar here i'm not part of that department, but. it's standardized within the career field that if they don't meet certain checkpoints like they just don't qualify for this level of care, you know it's like you know if you're not super stable you're homeless in and out of jail you're in and out of the hospital. So actively using you don't want to stop. And it's like well you don't qualify for this level of care, you need care like that that's how it works it doesn't start this is again. I say it all the time, the lowest level of care, which means that you're not receiving the lowest level of care for bus it's the least amount of oversight and structure that we have over the patient."
13607.0,Patient,Like we're not used. To use.
724.0,Provider,"Realistically, most people that shot man like yourself you're responsible for six sessions a month is typically 30 days in the month so six hours out of the molecule responsible to meet with somebody and it's probably less than six hours. Was don't beat for the full hour all the time."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,You got a handful of surveys that you're going to do to 410 surveys roughly a month. And they take about 10 minutes. You know I mean so it's like.
13607.0,Patient,yeah so much.
724.0,Provider,"We don't ask a lot, you know you're not here for it for three hours in a group or we're just hammering you hammer and. yeah, this is the level of care, because the individual qualified for us because they're doing I got patients now where i'm just like. What I meet with them and talk with them, I do their their assessment i'm like yeah they probably don't belong here, and then I type it up and i'm like they need higher level of care man. Like they're not showing up. they're still using it's like they need something more and we're not going to take responsibility for his they're not taking responsibility for their own."
13607.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
724.0,Provider,"When they're ready to come back we'll never say no, like if we never turn our door. or never shut our doors and somebody it's like come back when you're ready."
13607.0,Patient,like this one yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Well, anyway, these these programs are nationwide like I used to be like if. My job is every day when I meet with you and my other patients is to put myself, out of a job. That makes sense. Like yes, we want people to stop. using drugs I want them to get their lives back on track, I want them to start paying their taxes, you know I mean like I want them to. Speak yep back and be a good civilian and it's like so literally I put myself, out of a job, every time I talk to somebody but business is booming all the time, so it's like."
13607.0,Patient,yeah yeah it's crazy how much medication it's like really messing people I mean I never realized what it did to me until. It really hit me hard and and honestly for for as much as I was using and and and to get to the point where I was at I was like yeah this is. Some stop.
724.0,Provider,takes. It takes a lot of cars to do it um.
13607.0,Patient,"But see I never thought I could because I would try to do it like cold Turkey myself and oh my gosh the withdrawals, they just made you go back pretty much. So there was no way if I wouldn't have went to hospital I don't think I would have been able to do it on my own honestly I honestly don't know how people do it cold Turkey. Just."
724.0,Provider,"I do, what I don't right so. I empathize with people that have to do so when I worked in the Florida, and my very first coulson job, and this was like almost 10 years ago. The patients were court ordered into the program so they with a drug court, and they were given a choice right, so they were actively using. on a Thursday night and Friday morning, whatever it was the COPs came and took them away so it's not like they were trying to quit using drugs they were just like oh shit I got caught. yeah so. They present in front of the judge and I, like you know they're all whacked out. So you got to spend the next. 364 days in jail."
13607.0,Patient,Now.
724.0,Provider,"The difference between jail and prison is 364 days and then anything over that is prison right so and it's a misdemeanor for. possession so it's like 364 days in jail or you can go to a nine month program where it's six months in patient with three months after care, and if you complete that we're going to wipe this arrest away. What do you think people chose well they chose to go to the program because it like I don't want to stay."
13607.0,Patient,"Here, this already yeah."
724.0,Provider,But the caveat was in order to get to my program and we had two or three they're very similar to the area they had to be completely detoxed now.
13607.0,Patient,Oh wow.
724.0,Provider,"Florida Florida is very hardcore. So when he got to the jail, they were given a puke bucket and their bed matt, which is about this big and they were told the F off. Go to your cell I don't want to use planing we're not going to give you anything you're gonna puke and crap yourself and sweat hope that you're bulking doesn't beat the crap out of you for me. So they're like good luck, good luck there like if you purely out here on the floor you're cleaning it up, if you crap out here on the floor you're cleaning it up, so the guards like I don't want to hear it. i'm not a doctor. You know, occasionally like like the you know the the infirmary nurse would give them some tylenol no but it's not the game suboxone or and they were just like."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,They had to be 100% abstinent space they could not be on any medication when they came to us so they're like good luck so. And I would drive the Van to the jail pick a mosque. And they would come out like a walking dead like.
13607.0,Patient,Say man. Just yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Just you couldn't really have conversations with them because they're just like. So overwhelmed and everything, but they did it they detox in the correctional setting, which is probably the most difficult thing to do, but they did it, which means that the the will to endure and the human spirit is strong enough to do it in certain situations. it's 100% probably impossible to detox when you're in your own house. But that setting it is doable, so I would tell people be like. You can do it you're not likely going to die from opiate detox as far as I know it doesn't kill you unless you have like an underlying like heart condition. it's not like alcohol alcohol for sure can and will kill people with a cold Turkey it without medical intervention benzodiazepines same thing."
13607.0,Patient,It can really.
724.0,Provider,"kill you. You know if you've medically cold Turkey that or if you cold Turkey that without medical supervision, you can die and it's not because. yep oh alcohol is a huge killer. If you're a chemically dependent alcohol it's like people are chemically dependent opiates. It can kill you, because what happens is, you have a seizure and you collapse in your shoes and you hit your head and nobody finds you, and then you die."
13607.0,Patient,Okay okay.
724.0,Provider,"ben's those are very similar people will have seizures they will collapse into their shoes and there'll be will find them if they hit their head, they will it will bleed out and die on that doesn't happen with opiates. it's just the worst possible foot feels like you want to die."
13607.0,Patient,"Skinner and. run even know what to do, run away."
724.0,Provider,And it's all.
13607.0,Patient,I never thought I could do it like I really thought I can. On my own I kidding that's that's for sure.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it breaks people mentally it'll break you. Right so yeah there's nothing more difficult that somebody can enter in something like that, especially if they have like low resiliency anyway so it's. yeah. And you're sensitive, because your. Your pain receptors are maxed out, which means everything hurts now when it really. is always like the end of the world and it shouldn't be that to the pain receptors you're very sensitive. So yeah it's it's a mess. I had a patient one time in the methadone clinic and he was abusing benz's and he came to me, he was like hey i'm going to cold Turkey this stuff and I was like. don't do that. don't do that he's like yeah you know after you i'm going to do it no worries I was like okay. And then I saw him like it came in my office like. Like a week and a half later, you look great. I was like holy crap man. I was like I hadn't seen you for a while I was, I was like I thought bad things man, and I was like i'm glad to see you and we had like a really good conversation we stood up, we went into the hallway."
13607.0,Patient,And I was like.
724.0,Provider,"All right man I can't you're out and then he turned his head to this like through his shoulder to shoulder, and he just started doing circles like pirouettes and I was like."
13607.0,Patient,At first I was.
724.0,Provider,"playing games with me and I was like what. collapse into issues and he had a grand mal seizure and he was shaking so like I had like I caught him as he was going down. And I put it in what they call it a seat belt grips I put one on over here, and this hand slipped on there and I grabbed his his arm like T REX them, so I gave him like baby arms."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Well into the ground and I held up, we tried biting me spit on me puked on names of."
13607.0,Patient,melon like.
724.0,Provider,shaking so bad like like a shorts came off.
13607.0,Patient,bad shape out of nowhere.
724.0,Provider,"People were just walking by the right hey and I was like. hey can you call one one of. My supervisor can fly like my mentor. And he was like shocked what the hell, and I was like. A seizure, he was like oh my God what I was like thank you, Sir, and. And we essentially like save his life. Stop because we got them into the hospital setting. So that type of stuff is common and then he didn't remember any of it, and when I saw him I was like how you feeling like like weeks later. I was like okay cool you don't remember that day dude he's like not at all, I was, like all right well. you're welcome and you should feel bad that your pants fall off that. So."
13607.0,Patient,My God.
724.0,Provider,"it's very dangerous, but that doesn't happen with opiates it's just. It feels like it's not all but. that's what's beautiful about two boxes you. don't have to deal with any of that stuff so."
13607.0,Patient,"that's it so then what's the differences of boxing because. I as soon as I take it i'm so much better and i'm able to function like a normal human being. But how is it that that is not as addicting or whatever it is that, like the opiates but, again, it gives you the same feeling kind of you know."
724.0,Provider,"it's what they would call like. A partial agonist which means so picture and I always do this as a doctor explained it to me pain receptors like they they almost look like like champagne glasses right. So they're like this right. And we all have them get like a line across the bottom it's like your pain system alert system so like you know the difference between being like injured and being hurt right somebody told you like oh that sucks, but you can study tell them breaker toe and it's a different."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"you're like Oh, which I did two weeks ago I broke my toe twice now like the past two weeks so that he's breaking."
13607.0,Patient,I okay.
724.0,Provider,My my kids stroller and I was like oh.
13607.0,Patient,My gosh.
724.0,Provider,"I broken your soul so many times it's ridiculous. And I dragged my foot across like a rug to that, like the flat or rug out and the total like went this way that was like up there, it is again still."
13607.0,Patient,Looking at everything.
724.0,Provider,"yep so i'm trying to take it easy now, so the champagne Cup is like this. As Foreign. Chemicals come in, like opiates they feel that cup up and when it overflows and falls into the blood, the blood brain barrier zone right. And that's where you you the euphoria that's where you're like oh hell yeah this feels awesome right. Broken leg. So you have more of a separate have to be built, because the brain and the body knows that there's something still wrong and we can't be walking on the broken leg you're going to make things worse, so they build more receptors that's why. For to get high."
13607.0,Patient,Every time you. Talk to the markups and our.
724.0,Provider,"Customer accounts and eventually you Max out there's no more cups and then, when people use they don't get high anymore, they don't feel that euphoria that they want felt they just do it because they don't want to crap their pants no."
13607.0,Patient,yeah you know.
724.0,Provider,"Maintaining so. that's a full and full agonist right so narcotics are full so, which means helicopter and pour all over the. up as a partial it just fills the Cup. It tricks, the body into thinking that there is no real issue but there's no euphoria so you're not chasing it. And there's no doesn't exist because they're not breaking down. So you're just back to baseline almost you still have any more separation, you should, but the but the body and the brain are on the same page of this like Okay, things are good now this. is why we have a whole bunch of easy for our baseline I."
13607.0,Patient,guess.
724.0,Provider,"But there's no euphoric village right so that's why it's a partial partial agonist right. narcan is a full blown antagonists, which means that if you have narc handful around. Which is in the suboxone and then elicit opiates come in it blows everything out. it's like nope it's like goldline football de France it comes in and knock this one out and knock everything out of the system and that's why people go into full blown withdrawals, because now it's it's not everything out right."
13607.0,Patient,"So he said, if people use medication with the suboxone or the opiates with the suboxone it'll throw you off back."
724.0,Provider,"yep yep so no. Not a good look it's not a good feeling. So they call precipitated withdrawal yeah. Okay, so."
13607.0,Patient,Then that's when. it's okay.
724.0,Provider,"So it's a built in return, you know it discourages people from. Using illicit opiates on top of it."
13607.0,Patient,Okay that's good I mean that's good. yeah.
724.0,Provider,don't don't don't cheat the system.
13607.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no for sure. yeah yeah I was always curious about that, like How is it that. This helps you, but yet it's not like the other stuff because it's like i'm getting out of one stuff to get to another step and he explained it so."
724.0,Provider,They bought a full. Partial so that's how.
13607.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"explain to me i'm probably screwed up but I always look like a cop. And then you know full being like we're gonna fill it up and then poured over the partial to see it right to where it should be, when you drink gator it I don't want anything all over the place, so. that's how."
13607.0,Patient,"So, but why, why is it that the doctors prescribe this stuff and then I mean, is it there negligence or is it is it like and i'm not i'm not talking about my doctor i'm talking doctors in general, you know that they giving medications."
724.0,Provider,Like pain.
13607.0,Patient,mm hmm.
724.0,Provider,"Well, back in the early 2000s of big pharma. The pharmacology push oxy cotton, to the doctors and that there's like tons of videos you can watch on YouTube about how oxy cotton became like the number one thing and really like the catalyst for the opiate epidemic in this country. For many reasons. A lot of it's going. to convince these doctors, that it was not habit forming and you can find like old 2000 infomercials of oxy cotton or it's like try this new pain reliever it's not habit forming and."
13607.0,Patient,Rather than just giving them out give it a try. That they.
724.0,Provider,"All of it and it turns out that it isn't quite habit forming young people if you become dependent on it very. And there was no government oversight, which means that, like. If you had a license. to prescribe medication, you could just prescribed this medication. And people saw commercials and patients will come and be like hey I saw this video about this thing called oxy cotton, but oh yeah there is this thing and doctors are getting bonuses for prescribing a medication. So in Florida. I forget what year it was but 80% of all the prescription that was written for oxy cotton came out of one county in Florida, so I live in which city, do you live in."
13607.0,Patient,California and fresno county.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and there's a bunch of counties right and. Then entire yes so imagine. fresno county. A handful of people in fresno county road 80% of all the countries oxy cotton prescriptions you. know that the epicenter right. yeah Florida was Florida was the epicenter of it, because you had a population that was made up of old people, which means that they all had chronic pain."
13607.0,Patient,So for sure the.
724.0,Provider,"audience of oxy cotton there that's that right Florida has like the second or third largest population in the country they have like the largest population of. People like 55 and older and older so there's a huge amount of farming pharmacology going on. And there was no oversight so anybody can do pain management clinics popped up and everybody was giving it to everybody and you could walk into one get a bagful walk into like duffel bags full of this stuff. Well there's a. huge market for money so, is it was a YouTube video called the oxy cotton express. New shows that people are going to provide county getting it and then running it up to the tri state areas Ohio and just dispersing it and then eventually it just made its way everywhere right. So just like anything, the government does. In the beginning when they don't care enough or have enough oversight, the pendulum swings way to the other side, and now they have too much oversight, you know it's like put a date on a gunshot wound you like oh we'll fix this right now."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"They make it nearly impossible for providers to even in hospital settings to give out pain medication, the second that they that a doctor writes a prescription for anything, even in the House in the er on. That that providers flagged they're probably under a microscope they're only allowed to provide a certain amount of narcotics, in a certain period of a month. yep it gets really, really hard to get pain medication out in the hospital, which is the complete opposite because it's somewhere in the middle, there is room for that stuff right."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"We have more of an understanding we know how to like we should be able to know how to taper people if they are on that medication, not on a tape from getting prepared, but they didn't they just they used to give everybody everything, and then they. Just not. So then, people who were all sudden chemically dependent on the medication they weren't educated on the risks and now they don't get any more, and now they're dope happens they go back to the thing that's always been around. So if you. I used to ask patients to I was like how did you start and they'd be like pills pills are easy to clean."
13607.0,Patient,super again.
724.0,Provider,"Two pills he. says, I don't have to go down to like a shady alley and talk to a guy with a single string. of events like. And that's how it all started, and I would be like, if you could go back to your that first time and if I told you you'd be sticking needles like in between your toes or into your neck to get high What would you say that, like I wouldn't have believed, you and I. was going to be the case, getting into those pills I wouldn't have done it and I met all kinds of people like that and. yeah that's that's the state of the the opiate epidemic in this country. Change. Because fentanyl and heroin is coming over."
13607.0,Patient,"That fan laws hitting pretty hard everywhere, especially you know. it's coming on it overdoses. kids overdosing."
724.0,Provider,Coming up. it's coming into comics boxes from from overseas it's coming from a northern border it's too late.
13607.0,Patient,"So it's really sad and scary, for I can't yeah."
724.0,Provider,"And like I had patients that they were getting things that they thought they're getting it turns out, had fennel in it and it's killing them off cocaine had federal in it, killing them. People are you serious. People are smoking weed and we would test them and they would composite for finally realized what was like cross contamination, so if i'm a dealer and i'm sorry all kinds of shit there's a good chance that i'm probably not cleaning my equipment and just just the dust. particles shown on your stop killing them so it's like yeah man, so the universal precautions that I tell people is like, if you are we are doing coke or wherever your poison is you know pick pick it it's probably got fennel in it. If you just see everything is fennel on it should discourage more people but it doesn't it doesn't discards him. up, I have a high tolerance, so when you see people that overdose if one person overdoses there's a good chance that within that Community if they use that same dealer. there'll be multiple more overdoses because they're like oh shit john odd you know yeah I did, and we got the same supplier and they're like well john's tolerance isn't my tours. I want to go yeah that's because I mean I don't want to try and we would find people like we could have ODS come to the hospital 1234 at a time and you're like oh they're all they all know each other, they all hang. Was brain dead now and probably not going to make it. that's all."
13607.0,Patient,That is that is scary. Because I mean I could. Like tell my kids you know one them like don't even start to share because it's like like you're saying now animals everywhere and before I remember when we was just weed you didn't have to ask for purple or black. lead. Lead was leaning and now they have. All these kinds of different things it's like what.
724.0,Provider,"And it's still probably the safest thing if you get them from like. One California, because it's legal it's probably really easy now you don't have to worry about. straining Rhode island."
13607.0,Patient,Oh wow you're far away yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's decriminalized in my state, which means like you can travel with it, you just can't buy it legally and if you get caught with it, as long as it's under a certain volume like they don't bust your chops about it. They really it might as well be legal here there's just nowhere to buy it. The COPs they don't waste our time with it they're just like whatever."
13607.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,You got bigger and more important things to worry about then just weed.
13607.0,Patient,But yeah.
724.0,Provider,That sounds good.
13607.0,Patient,That is crazy. yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah that's your your psycho education for the night see you for sure right.
13607.0,Patient,That is crazy i'm still like in shock with everything you telling me it's like.
724.0,Provider,"watching go on YouTube because it's the only place, I can find it, but the oxy cotton express."
13607.0,Patient,And it's.
724.0,Provider,super informative it's interesting and it's shocking in so many ways you're just like wow that's crazy.
13607.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean just with the trauma alone it's like when I remember when I got into the ice pregnant and Stephen laden do make a big deal out of it or anything and then same thing, but I wasn't on the dose time I was taking afterwards, you know, like you said I I build a tolerance and. Warren Warren Warren."
724.0,Provider,"me the definition for chemical dependency or the criteria for chemical dependency as me like two things three things. There has to be a progression of use, which means that you take more and more to achieve a desired effect, there has to be a tolerance which comes from progression because it takes more and more to use."
13607.0,Patient,"And then, when you."
724.0,Provider,"stop using there has to be physical withdrawal symptoms not mental assent on because you can drink caffeine or no caffeine, will give you physical symptoms to. I think we doesn't give you any physical symptom maybe headaches, but that's typically not the case. So you can't be chemically dependent on we don't think on what cocaine, you can caffeine, you can nicotine, which is the most effective so."
13607.0,Patient,"It is, I mean people like that i'm cooking because I know a lot of people that are on stuff like that you know, like, how can I help them. realize that this stuff is real this fan out there, like would you just told me it's like."
724.0,Provider,"They probably know, and if you care about, and you can just tell me like I don't like that you do this, you know you gotta be careful because people are getting fat and all instead of cocaine sometimes are just a little bit mixed in their speed belong and dying. But people are ready to quit. doing the things that are bad for them when they're ready. You can't force them you can't grab it by the neck and drag them into a reality just there'll be resistant, and I mean people are ready when you're ready, you know and then people that want help ask for help you don't. You can't force help someone."
13607.0,Patient,that's true.
724.0,Provider,"So that's the sad part so yeah so those that's the criteria progression tolerance and then physical withdrawal symptoms if you've got all three if you check all those boxes, you have a chemical dependency problem."
13607.0,Patient,That was. It with. me.
724.0,Provider,it's unfortunate but. You think it's breaking.
13607.0,Patient,up now some matter now isn't getting help now compared to how it was.
724.0,Provider,yeah and that's all that matters that first step is the hardest.
13607.0,Patient,yeah cuz it's really bad it was really bad like.
724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah yep sounds like a cliche, but it is it's. Taking that initial step it's tough but it's not nearly as tough as what you're going through this is easy now once once you're once you're on like a maintenance dose you really get to like focus on all the other stuff that you neglected in the past. Years and you tighten up."
13607.0,Patient,"yeah you feel emotions like now, now I actually have like an emotional now, before I was like dad I was like zombie mode like I didn't feel I was like numb attain them and emotions. Like I felt. Like literally he would tell me that I had my heart that I was like damn sight and this and that but I didn't see it to me, I was like i'm just not like that i'm on I never realized that it was a medication. No, no, see me and now it's now I feel like a was always crying have all these different things and."
724.0,Provider,"that's your body's self regulating and getting back on track, like you should feel emotions and now it's all flooding and it's all coming back so it's. it's like a like a snowball you know so it's just going to get bigger and bigger and eventually it'll crash, and then you'd be like Okay, this is when I supposed to upset or This is where i'm supposed to cry and the sad movies i'm just not crying like. for no reason be like. i'm not i'm not crazy I promise. So yeah."
13607.0,Patient,"yeah thanks. I can talk and education right, then I think it's crazy."
724.0,Provider,"crazy. But it was not nice talking to you will follow up in like two weeks. Again, you have my email So if you run into any issues just email me."
13607.0,Patient,"Do you do I set up the next appointment, or are you going to send me an email or."
724.0,Provider,"I can set it up now, to see what I got. what's today, Wednesday. My that Wednesday filled up fast. Do you want to do a piano again."

13607.0,Patient,"Can you shoot me an email, so I can save it."
