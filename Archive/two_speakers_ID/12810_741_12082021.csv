12810.0,Patient,You are breaking up and you froze right is Sir.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, what i'm saying what I said was when things aren't going the way you want them to. But that's kind of when lots of things, not just one or two, but when lots of things. are not going the way you want them to. You focus on that. And, and that causes you. To get in that negative mindset right. Is that pretty accurate. Okay, so. i'm going to say. Thank you thinking about. Things. In the wrong bucket. So one of those things. Okay, what are some of the other things, I think. From what i've seen of your behavior so far is that you have. An energy drain. Like you don't. You don't have the energy. To get up. To do what you gotta do is that accurate. Okay. What else, what else have you noticed that. You experience, but right before you or or as you're going into that frame of mind where you want to hurt. hi panic. What are you panicking about."
12810.0,Patient,Being alone.
741.0,Provider,Okay. Right.
12810.0,Patient,To be a little.

12810.0,Patient,"Just because it's so easy to get. ready so hard to stay sober. I was always high. You know. have been so over. What why so this time like. To stay sober I just with things get bad, the first thing I want to do. Is the first day there was one. Okay."

12810.0,Patient,"I don't want to go back right. My gosh I don't know. I don't know. Because I don't because I really don't want to that's, the first thing that's a level is for status, I had."
741.0,Provider,"Typical I mean that's normal for an addict. and Being an addict is. it's normal to you what's abnormal is not using. Okay, so that's part of the reason why it's difficult. Depending on. Your significant attachments. As the people who are in your life are using, then you want to be with them and do that. If they're not then you don't want to be around it. You don't want to do it. Because. People congregate with people who are doing the same things."
12810.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,But have you ever noticed that when you started using after a while. It was like. You didn't want anybody around you that wasn't. didn't associate with anybody who didn't get high. So what are some things that that you can do. and internal coping strategies can make sure to take your mind off of your problems without contacting somebody. else like. Deep breathing when you start feeling that panic. or going for a bike ride is one of the things you said you did right. i'm sure that was a chilling. Experience and not something that you can do all the time.
12810.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,Maybe is there an exercise. or something that you can do in the House that would make you feel better.
12810.0,Patient,"There isn't much of it as easy as that i've been able to do. Because of my kids or because of somebody else like I just don't know how to deal with my emotions, I guess, because. I don't know. I just I don't know I took a bike ride. Not to call myself down but found out that he did call plays, so I got a little bike ride to start shit of honestly. Because I don't drive it was too late at night freebie take me anywhere. But I I realized that I did called down a lot."

741.0,Provider,"Okay well. I have an idea. um. I believe that you would benefit from working the steps. But for really, really working the 12."
12810.0,Patient,steps.
741.0,Provider,"I mean you know. That you're addicted and that you don't have. But. Do you know it in your heart. I think you're aware of it. I have no doubt about that. But, are you still planning in your head when. You could could talk or attempt to control it."

That will also be something I mean if you take it write it out you're mad then rip it up. That will release some of that anger. Okay. Have you tried ripping it up. Like in a little pieces. Okay, so let's try that. and trying to figure out another coping strategy, of course. This is gonna sound really stupid and it's really, really hard. But make a list of the things you're grateful for. I know it sounds ridiculous, how can that help and it's hard to find those. Things when you're angry. And you're wanting to hurt other people. or your mouth, I mean where you feel like he's got to be right. But when you. It will help you shift. If you will sit down and write out 10 things which are grateful for. That something you're willing to do. Okay. cuz I mean I, I understand that some of this stuff sounds really hokey and how can it possibly work but, believe it or not, it does work i've done it. I used to get so. i'm not one because people. There are people out there who use, am I don't experience of the consequences that I do. semi sorry my kid is trying to climb the tree."
12810.0,Patient,"Well, you see, like crazy cat yesterday. leave me alone all day yesterday."
741.0,Provider,Because he knew something was up. They are very in tune with what's going on with their owner.
12810.0,Patient,"And just kick was our guy here, he was every time he opens his computers, they would it be."
741.0,Provider,"On the keyboard. Okay. and I need a list of three people or three social settings that provide distraction. Like. If you've tried the things that you have, and that we have listed, which is going for a walk or bike ride or something. some type of exercises or journaling and writing and then whipping up the letter. or making a list of the 10 things that you're still grateful that you're grateful for and you're still feel like harming yourself or someone else.

741.0,Provider,"So, is he using right now."
12810.0,Patient,I would have to assume.

12810.0,Patient,"That that to hide yeah that's me I know that's basically what it is, but. hide what he's doing to themselves too late. As he will. Because he does, does it mean. To do anything I don't want to, if you want, what I want for being so he leaves that's where the trust comes into play. Like at all that he says."
741.0,Provider,"Okay now you've got tunnel vision, because there's got to be other people in your life and other places, that you can go to distract you from all of this mass."

I don't but I know there's a lot of them online okay. And, and because you have the responsibility of the children as laughter like online is probably. This the other part of it, too, is it's because you do have the anxiety and the trust issues. If you've got a barrier there between you and the other person. So right now that's a best option for you. But I want you to start attending. At least one. So, between now, the next time well actually I see you on Friday. yeah you have you have a couple of days to find several meetings online you don't necessarily have to attend them i'd like for you to attend one, but you don't have to.

Love me enough to stick around. So that through that option of dealing with garbage. That I didn't want to deal with out the window, because I didn't want to do that to him.

12810.0,Patient,kids.
741.0,Provider,"you realize that. it's. abandon them. As much as you want to. Okay, so, are you willing to start working the 12 steps.

We gotta stop the isolation. Though alleviate some of the fear. Okay. Can you speak that so that. So that transcriptionist can hear you. Yes, okay. All right, well that's kind of what i'm thinking now, we can do for treatment plan right now is to start working the 12."

12810.0,Patient,You know I deal with that a lot every year but.
741.0,Provider,"yeah this time of years really. really hard, because you have your own job but. That life was stolen at you. But you also have. All the expectations of Christmas as kind of like what is actually what Julie, said that expectations. are an invitation for a resentment. They really are. I tend to believe. and honestly as an addict I can't afford to have."
12810.0,Patient,resentment.
741.0,Provider,"They will get me high. quicker than anything else. So I have if i'm carrying around a grudge against somebody or something. Then i'm i'm walking on. thin ice, because that resentment can get me wasted. I don't really understand why I just know that that's the ladies. So um but what I did was I started working the steps. And it made changes in my mind, and in my in my life. And if there's any possible way that you can either. Like get. A kindle version of the big book or purchase a big book like a secondhand bookstore something they usually have on and and start reading."
