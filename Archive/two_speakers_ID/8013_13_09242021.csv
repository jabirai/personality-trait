13.0,Provider,Do you feel like you have better pulmonary function.
8013.0,Patient,nope. Which is. Sad stuff.
13.0,Provider,yeah.
8013.0,Patient,i've determined it's just fat. fat.
13.0,Provider,it's a strain that you know that but.
8013.0,Patient,"You know that. And I don't want it to be a strain anymore, and so i'm just redoubling and. Quality quadrupling my efforts. So that's where I am. Did you."
13.0,Provider,Are you in the House alone.
8013.0,Patient,"Right now, I have no Sir judson his room."
13.0,Provider,Oh so has he started classes.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah he just started a couple weeks ago, like last week or something."
13.0,Provider,So he drives back and forth.
8013.0,Patient,he's um he's still in that school in Minnesota.
13.0,Provider,"Oh, I see i'm sorry I thought he was going to albuquerque."
8013.0,Patient,"yeah he wants to go there next year. Okay, and he'll definitely be moving."
13.0,Provider,And how are things going with you to.
8013.0,Patient,"You know I get freaked out once in a while, because he's just not taking care of himself very well, but then I just try not to say anything and mostly it goes okay. He doesn't he doesn't really want to do anything so let's see I just tried to get him out for jeopardy come on out and watch jeopardy with me so then i'll come out. And hang out for like 45 minutes or something, but for the most part he's just in his. i've been trying to get him to get back on the meds he was taking, so I think he has started like won't tell me but. I think he started taking them again and that has changed, how much energy he has during the day, which is better. But um you know he's. I mean the signs that I see are like completely sunken in you know depression and not doing anything. Like he doesn't have an active prescription for. insulin and I don't know if he's taking care of it and i'm just like don't freak out don't freak out don't freak out. yeah. But i'm freaked out internally, you know. Just not freaking out on him."
13.0,Provider,"yeah. it's really unfortunate that. You know, because his prefrontal cortex is not yet fully online. He doesn't get the cause and effect. He asked him he does he but but experientially he's going to have to get really scared and end up in the hospital before he can connect the dots."
8013.0,Patient,"I think we're all like that, though I mean you know, I was going along happily eating bagels and whatever and I got my bloodwork back and it scared the shit out of me, you know, and I was just like look you knew this last time you got your blood work done it wasn't as bad it's like. I mean I don't know, sometimes I guess you just need that extra push if you're stuck in you're stuck in your whatever it is. So. yeah I mean, I hope that he you know, because it is extremely dangerous for him, I mean he could literally die easily you know you could just go into a coma. And I wouldn't hear that. I wouldn't you know, unless unless my brain said get up and go check him which I can't actually trust my brain that much with that because i'm so used to checking on him right, you know I wouldn't know. Until my sleep or dies."
13.0,Provider,off in a dorm.
8013.0,Patient,"No, I wouldn't. At least now I can lay. sneakily open His door and make sure that he's breathing."
13.0,Provider,yeah right right.
8013.0,Patient,"You know, but um yeah I was, I was really hoping, you know he went to see a new doctor and. i'm because his old doctor retired from the practice. So human to see the new doctor. And he came home and said she was really nice and he really liked her, but then he won't get his blood work done, he won't. He won't go back you know you won't make an appointment now he doesn't like her. You know and i'm like okay well there's a lot of doctors in albuquerque and he doesn't I don't want to drive two hours and i'm like. You know I didn't I didn't argue with him, I was just like Oh, you know cuz. I don't ever go to albuquerque if I can help it because I just have nobody there and no reason and nothing to do. But he has all of his friends with her, you know so for me I didn't you know I didn't think it would be like that big of a deal i'd be like yeah so then he'll go play frisbee afterwards and. hang out with his friends and stay overnight and come back the next day, you know, for me, like thinking he could go to albuquerque for unemployment wasn't like. drive there an hour and then drive back in our but that's how he saw it, you know so i'm trying not to argue with them i'm trying not to get into that space where he has a reason to you know. it's hard it's really hard because."
13.0,Provider,"Yes, it is."
8013.0,Patient,"He doesn't do the things he says he's going to do you know he's like okay well i'm going to. You know i'm going to make a phone call and then he doesn't make the phone call or i'm going to. You know, do something, and he just he forgets he gets wrapped up in his games or goes to sleep. So you know. Anyway, I have to just mind my own business. I saw you in July. yeah so I was doing really well, I just want you to know that I did I did I grew boundaries. and I was doing really well until I got stressed out. And then I caved in to my brother wanting to bring his daughter here. Even though. I had told her no multiple times I told him no multiple times, he just caught me in a moment of weakness, where it's really stressed. And he was crying, and all this shit. fucking attic bullshit anyway, so that was a lot of fun, I told her, she could she couldn't come unless she was vaccinated and. Then she's standing in the kitchen she's going. i've never gotten any vaccine, so why should I get that when i've never even gotten measles vaccine and then two days later, she texts me that she's that she's positive and I got it to so and eventually Andy got it. So I was pretty pissed off. That was really, really sick, I mean I went and got."
13.0,Provider,i've been talking Member know we talked multiple times yeah.
8013.0,Patient,"So I you know, I was pretty upset because, while I was sitting there like struggling for my life, you know, like not wanting to go to the hospital and get on a ventilator you know he's he's like I have to put my daughter up in a hotel because she doesn't feel welcomed by you. And i'm just like, can I just kill you now like you know, can I, if I could get up off the SOFA I would maybe come in here, you know. So. He got really sick to. I sent him to the hospital from third to get evaluated for monoclonal antibodies and they wouldn't give it to them, which made me think that he must have been using because there was. No other I couldn't think of any other reason they wouldn't give it to him he's like i'm too young i'm like you have hepatitis and you're a lifelong smoker those are like. You know, those are two good reasons for you to have been eligible for it but anyway, I didn't fight with them, but so like a week or so after that he finally he he goes, can I talk to you and i'm like I don't know. Because. Honestly, he was not communicating you know for like four weeks and. And then I was like well, what is it and he's like well, I just want to say i'm really sorry like okay well that's maybe a first time ever. So she's gone now apparently. she's supposedly."
13.0,Provider,buried what I learned.
8013.0,Patient,not to let down my boundaries. My boundaries are good for good for a reason.
13.0,Provider,They are good for a reason they're good for. Good for me yeah yeah and when when he's crying. You you don't have to take it on like it's something you have to solve.
8013.0,Patient,"I don't. It was just a moment of weakness is stupid moment of weakness I just you know. And it's, not that I have to be strong, all the time, you know I know that, like the whole reason i'm looking for a house and a space of my own that's like has my own doors and. You know where he's not in there is because you know I want it, I want to start over on that you know, like I want my space clearly defined with locks on the doors and nobody touches my stuff and you know what I mean it's just like."
13.0,Provider,yeah sure should none of that will change until you change it now you got to change all of that now.
8013.0,Patient,Well i'm working on it now.
13.0,Provider,"No, I mean I know you are and, and this was like it just doesn't get any clearer right backing off and letting someone be in your House that you know, is using and laughs in your face about not being vaccinated that."
8013.0,Patient,"That was her she's not there. That was stupid. can even learn our lesson, she was just like Oh well too bad not so bad she just had sniffles you know. Right, I think, I think that she's honestly, I think that she's got some pretty serious mental illness but that's just my unprofessional opinion but, honestly, she signs very serious mental illness."
13.0,Provider,"yeah you know, the fact that she couldn't generate any empathy for making to you know older people ill is. scary."
8013.0,Patient,That is scary that's that's like psychopath stuff. So anyway she's gone i'm glad to welcome in my house anymore.
13.0,Provider,So houses up.
8013.0,Patient,"I think, mostly just my health stuff you know I mean i'm doing okay I just. You know it's like I don't I don't want to just keep getting worse and worse. bloodwork and you know, every time get freaked out and, like, I have to do something I have to do something, so I have been doing stuff i'm back on my exercise plan and back eating better you know. I find it very hard you know and i've been kind of instead of. Instead of just eating i'm going like well why do you want to eat right now, because you just had breakfast and it seems to me like you're full so what's really going on here so i'm kind of like really. asking myself the right questions, instead of just indulging. And that's been helpful because it's just making me see you know, like I know i've been unhappy at my job for a long time, but I didn't really understand why I mean Besides that, I want to do something else but the other part of it is that i'm just bored like. You know I I learned new stuff all the time uh you know with my work, but nobody else's interested, you know, especially when I say, nobody else I mean my boss. My boss isn't interested some of my colleagues are you know and i'm like well, I really need this and we need to do as a team, we need to do that and it just gets kind of overseeing and overlooked, and I feel overseeing and overlooked. Because that's not these really super important factors aren't being integrated into our you know everyday ordinary work life, and so, then it's just boring. Then it's just back to the back to the you know. Whatever it's called. And, and you know going every day and work and then. I get up on Monday and i'm like Fuck it's Monday and on and on Tuesday i'm like two more days and on Wednesday i'm like yay. Tomorrow is my weekend, you know, like tomorrow my is my Friday and then on Thursday i'm like yay oh my God, I have to go back oh my God, you know my Friday is going too fast there's not enough weekend. Like and and i'm trying to you know, like I don't allow my brain to like go crazy with that kind of stuff, but these are thoughts they come up on their own, where I just go like okay that's a real thing, and you need to look at that and you want to address that and."
13.0,Provider,yeah.
8013.0,Patient,"You know, and I haven't really found a way to address it, that that works for me, yet you know I don't want to just go get another job and at a worst place you know where it's even more like looking at your fingers all the time, or whatever. And I hate fundraising whether or not i'm good at it, I don't I don't enjoy it so. So yeah I kind of have just been you know, looking at those kind of things I last have been doing a lot more creative work i've been doing a lot more writing and started a book and. My computer died. My laptop died and my work computer both died. She knew it was pretty tricky at my work computer I could kind of get it to work well enough to keep working on it for just basic things, but my laptop died completely. They had to replace the motherboard and then, so the last backup I had done was in May, so I lost three months I lost all the writing like even the program I had purchased to do the writing scribner was not on not on the backup and i'm like. Because if it had been I would have had at least the start, you know, but it was it was not there, so whatever poems and whatever journals and whatever whatever writing I did on the book and it was probably you know quite a bit, it was quite a bit all of that is gone."
13.0,Provider,that's so painful.
8013.0,Patient,"It was pretty painful it was pretty painful, but you know i've had this happen, a couple times in my life, where i've just like lost all of my writing, and you know, every time I just think like the world's going to end the world's going to end but I haven't died from it, so you know."
13.0,Provider,It sounds like you also haven't gone and bought an external hard drives and made backups automatic.
8013.0,Patient,"I have three of them I have 333 hard drives I have a two terabyte hard drive, which is the first thing I did when I got my computer back is instead of an image, I did file backup and. So yeah that's definitely and The thing is, is that I thought that a solid state drive was safe from anything and my solid state drive. had one of those errors an internal error or something forgot what it was. And so my my my solid state drive, which I thought was protecting me against everything in the world. And, and I just didn't I just didn't do my homework I didn't I didn't look further to go like are you sure. You know, and I was backing up, I was doing regular regular images, but like only about once a month, and then I got for some reason I got distracted and I didn't do it. And then that's when it happened, so I, it was only back to me, so I only lost three months and stuff I could have been years you know but. Anyway, yeah. I definitely learned that I have to back up more and better. And I also need to I don't I still don't think the computers working so I have to do a second backup just to make sure I have everything in two places and then. yeah because that was that was really sad, I thought that that was really sad. Like I said i've lost I lost all of my I had two boxes of one was of papers and one was of journals that I left in Germany, I mean journals going back to when I was. 18. And they're gone. and So all of my German journals which would have been very interesting."
13.0,Provider,yeah.
8013.0,Patient,"But it's it's okay I probably just wrote a bunch of whining. Like I don't have any money I don't know what to do. It seems to be like my universal thing in life, you know so. i'm sure it's fine, so I don't know what else is going on, I think I think what's going on is that i'm trying to figure out how to how to move forward with my life and how to move my life into something that is. more exciting not not more exciting that's not the terminology. that's more me centric. You know, and then what happens is because I can't find anything that will work for me is that I just start looking at things that aren't like practical like I found this beautiful house and mendocino is just perfect it's the perfect house for me. And it's it's like it's only like 1.6 million so. You said on."
13.0,Provider,you've got that is.
8013.0,Patient,"That in the in the agenda damn. Right yeah yep. So, but I also I it's not like I haven't been looking i've been going to look at houses and I had, I actually put a contract in on one I you know I had a contract and i'm wanting them when we got the inspection, it was a little bit too if he it was a lot to if he. It just required like upfront work that just to be safe. And you know, I have to be able to at least move in if it needs work I at least have to be safe living there. yeah and then I can do the work when I save some money you know. And i've looked at a lot of houses already but there's not a lot of my price range, although they they are coming down. And, most of them most of the ones in my price range don't have any land like nothing like not even nice yards. That was the reason I like that one because it had this big beautiful, it was a corner live, so I had this big beautiful yard. And when I went back to look at it wasn't quite as big as I had thought, but, but it was um it was a nice it was nice yard and it had this nice back part. And it, you know and it had it was it was like three bedrooms but one of them was super tiny like it would have like basically my desk would fit in there. But it had two other bedrooms it didn't you know I don't need a lot of space and it was a small house, but it was just too much needed too much up front. So and that's that's. And I looked at another House I looked I looked at two houses that had like the insides of the houses were great, but then they had like this much yard. Like just not enough to do any I couldn't even put my greenhouse back there they were that small yeah. So, then, I looked at another one which I really like I looked at the yard and I was like oh my God, this is just perfect, but the House again it was just should. You can see like maybe 15 pieces of evidence, I mean like in looking at the ceiling you saw evidence of a roof leaks, like in 10 or 15 places and the floors have were like. They weren't the floors weren't they were just what do you call that at that would that like that you usually cover with something."
13.0,Provider,Like five.
8013.0,Patient,"Know it's, just like the under part of a floor it needed it needed flooring and it was just like Okay, and then the anyway. You can't I can't move into a place like that I have friends who could move into a place like that. Like they're the kind of people who can like do all the rewiring and you know put beautiful things on the walls and make it into like this beautiful house, my friends did that around the corner here. But that's not who I am I can't even get up off the floor, so how am I going to get down on the floor to you know, to do all this kind of stuff yeah. So it has to be something that I can move into so that's kind of where i've been centering my energies like really kind of focusing on finding something and. And so i've been putting a lot of energy into that go into looking places and and i'm you know trying not to too often go off into that land of the perfect houses that are only 1.6 million. Because that the places I want here, you know, on i'm West alameda same thing you know the land is 1.3 million and there's a house there that's about 400. You know, which is also over my budget so. yeah and just. You know, doing doing the internal work, you know, like okay my boundaries are good, I understand my my boundaries are there, my boundaries are really good at protecting me and if I don't. You know, like doing that work just recognizing every time something here happens that there's a corresponding recognition to it, where i'm going yep that's why that's why it's a good thing you know. And just. doing the work. Then there's days like today, where it's like hey I haven't but I really just want to like go eat anything even things I don't like like pizza yeah that sounds good, and I mean like pizza that much you know have your really good pizza for me to like it."
13.0,Provider,And that's from the boredom.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know if it's boredom yeah I think it's I think it's I think it's like an interim thing you know it's like. i'm not quite here and i'm not quite there, for I am here but it's not satisfactory and i'm kind of like making you know i'm working on it, you know i'm doing lots of. i'm doing clearing in small batches which is better than no clearing at all, which you can see, if you look at my get my show this is like. This is like my standard everything like piles. hate it it's like that everywhere in my house, so I started I started the Marie kondo method i've been watching her on netflix and I was like Okay, I can do this I pulled all my clothes out of the closet and then I nearly died because it's so much work, I was just like. I have a lot of problems with my hip right now so. Anyway, so just in small batches i've been doing it, since that first big batch i've been doing them like one drawer a day. So, but it's pretty cool you know getting rid of stuff and clearing, this is going to be a big one, this my office here because it's got lots of stuff in it from other people. So we're all this stuff is from my mom and my sister and. And some of that stuff I want to keep I don't want to let go of all of it. Anyway, so. What do you think."
13.0,Provider,"Well i'll tell you one thing that has worked for me and, and that is the mantra of. you're doing great every time I do even one tiny little thing i'll have the idea, you know i'd really like to just sit down and eat a bunch of ice cream. I will say and you're doing great you're doing great and there's something about that constant reinforcement that comes from inside me that makes it possible to then. go forward go on. And if I spend any time feeling deprived. Then I start cycling down."
8013.0,Patient,"That is the cycle isn't it it's a feeling of like it's like this, it is a feeling of like lack. yeah not enough and."
13.0,Provider,"Exactly, which is a negative space. yeah and it's all connected to all the other negative stuff we've solved already stuff we've already made sense of but it's still all connected, so it just feels so big but those those you know every few minutes saying you're doing great you're doing great and. it's made. An impact on."
8013.0,Patient,Opening to put signs all over my house again.
13.0,Provider,You might.
8013.0,Patient,"think you know I think we talked about this because I seem to remember printing something up that I actually never cut apart and put on my walls. But they were all things like you're doing you know this you're doing great this is amazing, or whatever I don't remember what it was, but um I remember printing them out. Or the guy saved the fire."
13.0,Provider,But that's something that's easy to do.
8013.0,Patient,And maybe already got. That.
13.0,Provider,power that self talk is everything right it's everything.
8013.0,Patient,"For the first time in like six years I took stuff off of my walls. Because usually I do my meditation is facing this way, but I got this new mattress and I don't want it to get sag down on one side, so i've been like rotating where it's fit. And so i've been doing my meditations, on the other side and there's this you know there's these three posters that i've had up there, for years, six years, one of them is a vision board from. And I kept it up because, like kind of my goals are still the same you know it's like get a farm going, and you know lose the rest of your weight and dance and. You know it's like you know, the thing it's technically very good to good vision board, and I was like Okay, you can just keep it up, but now i'm like you know there were two other things and i'm a very word oriented person so, even though I do vision boards there's a lot of words and. So these other ones were like. You know. They were just telling me to do things like you don't like your job quit and if you're looking for the love of your life stop start doing the things that you love and the love of your life will show up which I kind of really believe that. And, and things like that, but anyway, I just felt like I need my walls to stop telling me what to do. So I pulled them down and and my friend, is a is a jeweler and she's having a sale and she had this one ring. And it was really expensive and it didn't actually match me like it's not not like my colors or anything, and it was gold was silver accents and she usually only does silver. And and but I was just like the write up about it, you know was because it was Ruby and diamond these like teeny teeny tiny things and. And it was just like all about the Queen and I was like I really I really need to celebrate the Queen and not. And not keep telling like the Queen doesn't let her walls tell her what to do the Queen I I am the Queen and i've been kind of saying that for a while. You know, like you know, like I jokingly said it to my house cleaners, because they used to do like spend all their time in my mom's room and i'm like. Oh she's not the Queen in this House, I am you know, but it was kind of like jokingly but you know I mean I meant it seriously that they needed to spend way more time in the rest of the House and my mom's part because Fuck that shit um and and. And somebody bought the ring, so I didn't get it. But it's the end of that story, but um no, I think that it made me aware that the this clean energy is really calling to me, and you know I turned 60 and all everything everything right now is kind of all comes back to that you know it's like. How do I situate myself for the rest of my life, this is the Queen, you know, like the Queen the crone the crone time of my life like how do I sit situate myself, so that I can like relax into that phase and be you know, like. I don't know what I need to be, but just just to have that energy have this space where that energy is really tops. Like you, like you're you are, and you definitely have the Queen space you're like this is my house, and this is how I This is like the Queen, like you, you have your Royal castle."
13.0,Provider,yeah and.
8013.0,Patient,And I think about that.
13.0,Provider,I want to. I don't work too much. yeah I get to play. yeah yeah. And I think our next slide.
8013.0,Patient,"Please King yeah being able to create that space also allowed for a partner to come in, you know it's like I I recognize I recognize that, like. Your I have other friends who have that same thing so it's like but I recognize that this is this is where like my all of my yearning is is like geared to that. You know, having chickens or not having chickens, you know, like having a garden or not having a garden like just just having the space where i'm the one that's deciding what i'm having and what i'm not having an and that's particularly geared towards. The crone energy that I feel really, really strongly. When write a book write a book go ahead. You know, you want to learn how to do some art take a class, you can do that, you know you don't know how to do something, but let's go find out how to do it, you know. yeah well, I want to do a writing class I don't I don't know if I want to do one on YouTube but i'm. Just that that is where that's where all of my energy is geared towards and so. i'm kind of dancing after it going how, how do I do it."
13.0,Provider,"yeah because if. there's a rub there's a funny thing about. it's the visualization that's very important, and then the self talk that says i'm becoming. yeah is unfolding in front of me, and then, when when the small steps. present themselves. you've got the energy to do them, whereas when there's that self talk of lack. there's no energy left to."
8013.0,Patient,Actually.
13.0,Provider,Take the steps toward the dream.
8013.0,Patient,"You can't there's nothing you can't do it, it has and, and so I do I do affirmations and I, you know i'm pretty careful about my wording. Although I have to see I wrote out a whole list of affirmations to create a CD or create an MP3 so that I haven't played 24 seven and I sent it to a to an acquaintance of mine who's a hypnotherapist. And, and she was like okay well let's just revise those a little bit. yeah it was really good that I did it because she. The wording is great, so I did a recording of that and Sergio put it to behind me or. Put not behind it, and so I have now that have that playing 24 seven now nice but it's all like really positive things you know not like i'm losing weight now."
13.0,Provider,Right.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah cuz that's not. that's not really helpful and and I haven't you know I haven't said, like i'm losing weight as a mantra that's like you know i'm I see I do everything in my power to to. achieve my my ultra you know my optimal health."
13.0,Provider,yeah that's it i'm getting healthier and healthier.
8013.0,Patient,yeah so. yeah so that's going 24 seven I do think that. that's helping.
13.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8013.0,Patient,"Because i'm i'm bluish like that, but I think it helps you know it because I listened to it when i'm sleeping and and it and it plays, even when i'm not there and so there's always this energy of me kind of backing myself up with these positive and helpful, you know affirmations. So minute eating I do like a little bit something sweet after I eat, so I made my date my deep treats but I haven't been eating, you know, sugar and mostly not eating carbs like. The only kind of carbs i'm I am eating carbs but i'm eating extremely few. My body doesn't actually do good without any so i've just been like let's not eat bread, if you know, like let's just do one small portion of carbs a day. You know not like limiting myself but kind of like as a guideline so for breakfast I had like you know, a quarter of a cup of brown rice, with some rifai beans and eggs like that, for me is this great breakfast and. And then you know the other night I, and I may be great Soups so i'm a big soup person. Is you know so i've been making Soups to eat, and so there are you know I don't like white potatoes, but I do eat sweet potatoes and those have a lot of carbs and and but they're really super healthy for you, so I feel like you know, like just focus on the healthy things and yeah. yeah and then the other night I was like oh i'm just so hungry and I was like well you know you've been. Reducing how much you eat that's normal for you to be healthy, and you can have something more, if you want, so I had some I had some. what's that guy's name Dave dave's well actually was trader joe's but like Dave super bread, you know their little slices died two little slices and that was perfect and then the next day I wasn't hungry anymore so. I don't know. Trying to do everything right. But also trying not to regulate you know, like. yeah every that crazy diet, I did it was so effective I lost 80 pounds, it was so good, but I would I would never do that again."
13.0,Provider,yeah I don't I don't think it's healthy personally.
8013.0,Patient,"No, it didn't it would I don't think it was healthy because it didn't encourage me to you know, like adopt those adopt those guidelines as a way to live. Right and that's why i'm like so out of it like you know i'm not i'm just not gonna. i'm not going to do it, I know enough, I really know enough, I could be a dietitian like I really know enough about food and and health, you know. I don't I don't need I don't need that like that's not that's not helpful what's helpful is like hey i'm doing really well eating Soups I love eating Soups and if I put butternut squash and and sweet potatoes in there yeah and that's an awesome soup. And i'm not. i'm not hungry after I eat that soup. You know. kind of things like that that encourages me to make that more of a lifestyle choice than a than a, this is a diet."
13.0,Provider,Right right again it's that mindset of deprivation. That will come back and bite us in the butt.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I did I did do really well on that diet, but I what I did never really dealt with was like the stress, you know how stress affects my eating and how. You know, like when when I when I am not listening to myself, and when I don't have good boundaries and when i'm not making myself the Center of attention that causes huge amounts of stress to me. And I don't handle stress very well and the way I go is I just like yes, food, a lot of it stuffing down, you know, like a lot a lot like way more than I even need to eat. So."
13.0,Provider,Pretty common you're not alone.
8013.0,Patient,"Now I don't think I am alone. Fortunately. I am in a lot of pain lot of pain and body is not unhappy, even though i'm doing good things my hip is out, and I can't get a doctor's appointment for a couple months, and that means like even if. Even if I were to get it approved I probably wouldn't be able to get surgery until next year and then i'd have to pay it and. I can't I can't quite figure that part out but it's frustrating because i've been you know, like back on my bike every I was only off because of code, but i'm back on my bike every day and. You know, exercising working with weights again to really like, but then i'd like to take a. You know. A w lk and. With the with the with the pub. Night it hurts so much I can just barely do it. So. I wish that I I wish that that wasn't an issue. But, again, I think the way it's causing it not causing it, but at least after beating it."
13.0,Provider,"Oh yeah it, it has to be. it's just a strain."
8013.0,Patient,"yeah I had a friend once in Germany, I don't know if I told you this story or not and i'm and I was like. I don't know, I think, maybe 20 pounds overweight pretty much my whole life but I mean like 20 pounds like it was never really it was never more than that. You know, it was just I had a little bit of extra, but it was you know just how I was, and she she said something one time she goes Oh, you should lose some weight and I was like Fuck you first of all. And, and I was like i'm not i'm not overweight and she's like maybe just a little, and I said okay so it's maybe 20 pounds and she goes. You know what you should do is put 20 pounds of rock and rocks in a backpack and carry that you know and and that made an impression on me, I was like yeah that's really true actually pick up something for 20 pounds it's quite a bit I have way more I five times that much you know."
13.0,Provider,One time oprah I didn't watch much oprah but one time I happen to catch part of the show where she had been with a personal trainer and a dietitian course you know she could have someone cooking for her and always the perfect food and she brought in a wheelbarrow.
8013.0,Patient,full of.
13.0,Provider,"fat right, yes, of what she had lost."
8013.0,Patient,"She you know what she did is she went on a liquid diet for that. And I would I didn't see that show, but I saw repeated that show, and she had gone on this liquid diet and so for like a couple months you hadn't eaten any solid food she just had these like. You know weird shakes they weren't shakes that she put in the mixer, but they were like this weird shakes and so she lost all that all that way as you brought out that was like a wagon. yeah he pulled out the wagon on stage, just like you know she owns weight watchers now right."
13.0,Provider,She guys she owns it.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah it's pretty interesting anyway, but they actually weight watchers has a better program now I use it to just catalog what i'm eating, but they have a it's a much better program than it used to be, but anyway. yeah and then she she gained it all back because, like me, she didn't deal with your stress."
13.0,Provider,Like like most of us.
8013.0,Patient,yeah probably.
13.0,Provider,"You know. And then there's the whole I mean, on the one hand, I know that my extra weight puts a strain on my back and my knees and my hips. And the other part of me knows that. itself soon I use food. yeah and it's really tough itself sue's with carrots."
8013.0,Patient,"it's so hard. it's so hard character so hard to eat. I bought some hummus and I was like no put that back because you're not buying crackers and I was like. Oh yeah i'm not hmm, but I can eat hummus with celery and have I is them has been opened. No."
13.0,Provider,"Well, let me I put a mustard and hummus. together and dip my carrots in that."
8013.0,Patient,I can't eat carrots they're really actually I really can't eat no curious because there's just so hard for my deed. yeah but but I can't eat celery and I like celery celery is good for your brain and everything with the brain is good. i've been do I signed up for that brain brain HQ.
13.0,Provider,I don't know right yeah.
8013.0,Patient,"And I started doing it and I actually noticed a difference, like, I noticed the difference actually pretty immediately, and then I I think I got busy with something and I stopped doing it so now i've been noticing how i'm like it feels a little five year. So I feel like I should keep doing that. It did help but they're hard that's not like that's not like gaming you know enough not like pleasurable. You know, like words or whatever. I play scrabble with my friends."
13.0,Provider,What what are you doing it's fun besides scrabble with your friends.
8013.0,Patient,"i'm not doing a lot that's fun, but I do meet up with my boggle group we meet up every two weeks. But we changed it so we were meeting we were meeting every every week, which was really nice during the during the heat of the pandemic, you know we we met every week online and we played bhagwan line. And that was, you know that and I keep we have a thread on our texts we had like a text right and so there's four of us and we're pretty we're pretty in touch with each other all the time, so. Like I don't feel any kind of isolation or anything like that and that's pretty much my fun, I think I take the dog out to the park when it's not too hot I really like it, I take her to the dog park over at the end of. it's over by the humane society they have these these single user dog parks and so I just let her in and I don't have to have her on a leash. And it's so much fun because it's like this it's this open space, and so I can walk and she can run and I can throw the ball, for her and yesterday, I saw a little rattlesnake and otherwise it's really nice out there. didn't like Hello rattlesnake I mean it didn't bother me didn't do anything I just went up oh. And it just kept it to think didn't care what I was saying it just kept wailing away. But not little ones are dangerous."
13.0,Provider,yeah they are there more dangerous than the big ones.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah because they don't know how to you don't know how to. Anyway, I don't know how to be cautious, so I wasn't so thrilled about that, but it's the first time i've seen when there. And, otherwise I really like it, because it's it's on the South side, where there's like there's no, you know the humane societies there but that's like the only thing you don't see anything else and it's just you and sky and ground and I missed those kind of walks. So I think that's about it that I do for fun. I was writing a book that was fun. yeah it got too dark, though. yeah God too dark."
13.0,Provider,"Well, maybe that was the universe's way of saying."
8013.0,Patient,That through dark that's what I said that wasn't working.
13.0,Provider,What would you write about now.
8013.0,Patient,"You know what I really wanted I I really want to write a romance but. I think that there's value in what i've learned in life, and I just don't know how to put that into like a. format, you know, like I don't know if you've ever read mark NICO."
13.0,Provider,"Again, oh yes yeah yeah."
8013.0,Patient,"I love mark NICO he's so amazing I love stuff like that, and I would love to write like that, but. I don't know. I don't I don't i'm not sure that I actually have it, you know, or it may be needs a little bit more work. But I really like I really like that style you know it's it's reflective and it's it's not like, because I was reading through some of my blogs from a very long time ago. Like 13 years ago and I had a blog and I just thought I knew everything and I, and I, you know was just so out there. Saying that this is how we had to do things or whatever and. um. And now I look at that and I go you knew nothing. But there's you know there's still some good stuff in there and I thought, maybe if I took some of those things that I wrote about and just like added on you know the last 1314 years of of shifting from that 14 kind of energy to the crone energy maybe. yeah it would come out a little bit differently, and maybe it would be you know, maybe I could be more introspective instead of telling people I know everything or whatever. Because when you finally had to be a crone you realize you knew nothing."
13.0,Provider,"it's quite humbling. yeah I had a patient today, who was telling me that his father died at a very old age, and I said how old was he."
8013.0,Patient,And he said 6160 oh my God.
13.0,Provider,"anyway. And i'm reading a new author now, who I think is absolutely fabulous her name is Louise penny."
8013.0,Patient,uh huh What did she write.
13.0,Provider,"they're they're kind of mystery. novels but the her storyline and her character development is exquisite. Beautiful writing lovely stories, a lot of compassion and caring and. i've just. she's got a series and I accidentally read the last one of the series and thought this is one of the best books ever written."
8013.0,Patient,"So, then you gotta start reading them all."
13.0,Provider,that's okay yeah that was fine it's lovely to have a nice author.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah I yeah I think I could maybe you know focus on more fun, but. not exactly sure how. Everything costs money, you know the things like i'd love to go take some classes can really would like to go take some classes, like some beginner painting classes, or you know writing classes, or whatever, but I haven't it's pretty expensive."
13.0,Provider,"And even even at it, because of your income they would don't think."
8013.0,Patient,"Why make more money now. I sold have very little money but. I make more I met you know, like in two years or three years i've increased my income."
13.0,Provider,Good.
8013.0,Patient,It is a good.
13.0,Provider,Save but. yeah so.
8013.0,Patient,"right here. i'm still paying off debt but i'm getting like I have you know, not so much debt left you know which before. You know, it was like I couldn't have debt, because I had no way to pay it and I was living hand to mouth and the last week of the month, like, I still I still have a lot of money in my account but that's also because your photos me when he hasn't gotten his pay. So. i'm trying not to remind him 16 times to deal with. So far, it's only three. yeah anyway. So I don't think I get a discount at school."
13.0,Provider,yeah if you make too much money they don't they won't let you they don't give you a break.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah and you can do some classes like non credit classes, but even those are pretty expensive, especially the painting ones like out of even out the College, it was like a lot of money. And I was like you're a Community college just because I mean just because it's an artist town doesn't mean you should be charging like outrageous prices for like one day courses or six day courses."
13.0,Provider,yeah.
8013.0,Patient,"It was quite quite expensive it was prohibitive yeah. So, then, I was like Oh well, you should just do that whole series with that guy Bob this is named Bob the PBS guy."
13.0,Provider,I think so yeah.
8013.0,Patient,"yeah because somebody told me that he's actually you know if you watch them all in order. he's actually an excellent teacher. But it's like I haven't found the energy to do that. yeah, I guess, maybe I should focus on fun. And you're doing great."
13.0,Provider,yeah yeah we only have one minute left so. yeah those two things just increase the fun by some small factor and get those in print out whatever it is. i'm amazing you're doing great something that will catch your ice you're doing it a lot.
8013.0,Patient,"Okay, all right i'm going to work on that i'm going to print them out and work on it. i'll do that today."
13.0,Provider,"All right, it was nice seeing you."
8013.0,Patient,"nice to see you. I think what I wanted to point, it was because I was worried I wasn't gonna be able to do this, get this weight off."
13.0,Provider,You will.
8013.0,Patient,"I will, I have no doubt that's also a mantra on my. that's on my on my altar actually."
13.0,Provider,"yeah that's a problem, though you cuz you can't have a negative in there."
8013.0,Patient,I know.
13.0,Provider,I have confidence.
8013.0,Patient,Oh yeah I have competence is.
13.0,Provider,that confidence is building more and more.
8013.0,Patient,"With it well, when you say, I have no doubt it means you have no doubt. So, with the opposite of no doubt."
13.0,Provider,"i'm sure you're sure. i'm becoming more sure, so you don't have to tell a lie. Because that that works against us confident thing ever born well. Right right."
8013.0,Patient,yeah maybe not.
13.0,Provider,"But i'm becoming confident, it puts it in the positive, because your brain hears doubt it doesn't here they're not."
8013.0,Patient,"haha yeah. Okay. i'll work on that one should I call him back, though. I feel like I should call. call back up my insurance."
13.0,Provider,You probably want to talk to someone in finance. Okay okay.
8013.0,Patient,"All right. Well, thank you very."
13.0,Provider,"Much here, let me know when you want another one."
8013.0,Patient,I will talk to you soon.
13.0,Provider,"bye bye. All right, I started a chart on her she'd be pretty simple put a session note in there. Thank you very much indeed dictation."
