3320.0,Patient,"yeah we can't act like that ever I don't think. she's she was. She was acting like really immature. And it all started with her daughter she smashed her daughter a buyer here because I guess she wasn't standing still why she just woke up in the heat. You know I mean she grabbed by your hair color all the way across the hotel room I fucking hate you right now is what she told me. I hate Rana sit down and I mean she dragged across the room buyer here instead around the check. And the girl sitting there Christ tells you need shut up quick crying she's like i'm hungry said no you're not going to eat your noggin cuz you wouldn't let me brush your hair. I was like no you can't tell it that you can do that, so I gave her my honey, but I have already went to the front and I got you know, a banana and. I was eating a banana so I gave her the hummingbird well after that I set her up to eat it, I went outside and I went got my girlfriend up late. I come back, no, thank you, I got you so I don't want it i'm not fucking hungry or the dam and we can have a bad day and she turned around and got my face tell me you better shut the Fuck up it's like booster with my head until she sat down, I mean yeah I almost fully headbutted."
105.0,Provider,Oh no sorry to that.
3320.0,Patient,It was.
105.0,Provider,Is this the first time you've seen that type of parenting from her.
3320.0,Patient,"No, no, the way she doesn't think bothers me a lot and I don't say nothing because it's her daughter, but there's just some shit i'm not gonna make go if that was my daughter I would be there at. You know what I mean i'm just being honest you're not country. that's what i'm saying, she wants me to step in and step Daddy but she doesn't like you, whenever i'm telling her. That she's not she you know. She doesn't seem shit they were babies that they treat their daughters, no more than a pet you know to me that's their property, you know what I mean. she's not a child and sort of the same you can sit there and tell five year old that you are, that you make them right now, they literally think that you. They can't decide that they don't know that you're just talking out of anger, you know what I mean like you there's a difference between discipline addition spec sheet. And then I guess it didn't take until she called my mom and my mom had to make her son and she wasn't act. Then she started telling me she sorry. For her anger, like you, don't have an anger problem that looks like somebody."
105.0,Provider,That looks like someone who's what say the last part.
3320.0,Patient,coming off drugs.
105.0,Provider,I see.
3320.0,Patient,You know what I mean.
105.0,Provider,yeah you're still suspicious of that.
3320.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i've been me, I mean just little things like that just. It just points for today and. So I don't know if it's not the drugs. I don't know I don't know if I. I might be able to go my shit."
105.0,Provider,well. i'm curious about that that does say something that you haven't taken your things back what do you think that says.
3320.0,Patient,I want to leave without.
105.0,Provider,Know tell me more. Because you're without a car here without your car.
3320.0,Patient,"yeah I know. Her suburban she she didn't maintain you know if it was fucking up before I go I did the best that I could, but at the end of the day, it's more than I know have to you know what I mean. mm hmm and so i've been telling her she's been she's been relying on you know the explorer. Which explorers in both of our names, but because of that fight, she tried to sit there and tell me that she wants the money that you put into it i'm like what did you put into it, I spent 3200 cash on the. only thing you did is rich furniture. i'm confused. And i'm just i'm not. Like she apologized for all that I just can't release you to sit there and try to rush it my face, and you know what I mean. When I told her, she texted me after I left and said i'm going to use the explorer. I was like go ahead, but you need to get your spirit in. him suicide and get it fixed because I want my quarterback he's like what really I was like yeah. I bought it. it's like Oh well, that's whisper saying, she wants this bag bag, is that nothing and you're delusional. I don't know if she was confusing me with one brother taxes. But he was accused me i'm never happy."
105.0,Provider,"Do you truly trust your perception of what's going on, do you use is there some doubt that what you're seeing is unacceptable, this is unhealthy behavior are you not trusting yourself."
3320.0,Patient,"around her. yeah i'm telling you, it was like that, and just from all my time being in prison approached me like. You i'm telling you I blacked out I literally came to my senses on my knees and I had already pushed on it, you know what I mean that's what i'm seeing with that. I told her day. With Eric he said that. on a regular basis. We can argue, we can talk about whatever we want. But just that right there, I mean being in prison that's. something that happens in your mind I don't I don't know how to explain it ptsd when when somebody does something like that it's instant reaction don't know how to stop it, I don't know what causes it but it's like I disappeared. yeah."
105.0,Provider,So you have a dissociative response I understand.
3320.0,Patient,I get that.
105.0,Provider,"I. You know I got the sense, a moment ago you started, I think it could be wrong, I think you may have said, I tried to tell iris if it gets. Where i'm violent and I start to do this angry dissociative thing, then why like I don't know, did you already draw a line and you were just starting to date her."
3320.0,Patient,"know the last time we got into an argument it got kind of stupid, I told her every gets this stupid again. I can't do it, I can't go to jail I can't go back to prison. And now was the time they should sit there delete best."
105.0,Provider,"There was no consequence, I didn't hear what the consequences be if we get this stupid again, then, what will happen to the relationship I didn't hear what would happen. i'll leave Okay, and you are left now."
3320.0,Patient,never talk to me again that's what i'm known for.
105.0,Provider,"that's what you're known for. When you are done you're really done when you've really made up your mind you're done. And i'm asking no one's listening, have you made up your mind about iris."
3320.0,Patient,I don't know it's still.
105.0,Provider,"that's a no if it isn't a yes, then it's a no I don't think you've made up your mind is left, because you don't want it to be stupid. you're still deciding it sounds like you're deciding."
3320.0,Patient,"But there's a lot more to it, I have. No money at all my stuff's over there kind of got my family pushing you're trying to make it right with your if I can. say all over."
105.0,Provider,"Well, what do you want, for me, you can have any version you want. there's some trappings was sharing opinion. That isn't comfortable, these are incredibly difficult decisions to make, and you are hearing everyone say. Make the relationship work and I don't know that you too. Can you tell me if this is the direction you want. I don't know that you to have enough self awareness enough coping skills enough sobriety again i'm ignorant night let's leave room for that okay. to navigate what is already difficult for people. That don't have a trauma history don't have incarceration don't have attachment ruptured attachment. shock trauma drug use. it's already hard relationships are already hard. And you have these additional challenges, and you have pressure to just stay together because it looks good she's lovely she has a child it's a perfect little family unit how great is that well it's not great."
3320.0,Patient,This is home for the most part we get along.
105.0,Provider,"You are onto something. period I. believe you there is something off and it doesn't matter what it is, and I know that one's a little probably harder to take in. You sticking with there's something off is going to be hard enough you're going to have your mother saying just work it out, but what do we do with this thing that you have had for a while to suspecting. So matthew's or something you're suspecting something, and you. However, you've been managing it just. you're going to watch and investigate and now you know I don't know how you're doing it, but you have felt there is something or sometime now. If someone said, if I ever said to you there's something off, and I want to rule out whether it's drug use, would you go get a drug screen and say look i'm going to test positive for buprenorphine for. thc. But yes, I would eventually you might balk at it and feel like doubted not like it, but eventually would you go. Would you get a drug screen for."
3320.0,Patient,"You guys send them to them, so he sees those results."
105.0,Provider,Just answer my question.
3320.0,Patient,I don't know.
105.0,Provider,Okay. Well it's hypothetical I just proposed a hypothetical scenario.
3320.0,Patient,I don't think that I look.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, because you're proud."
3320.0,Patient,"yeah I mean unless they volunteered to do and to like type scenario, you know to me."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, well then there there's some negotiation in there, fine we'll go do it together. Well let's go. yeah my pride and if you had the ability. To be okay, with the fact that that's who you are, you might be able to say well i'm a little too proud to do that kind of feel like like a kid or something you know, but if we both did it. I might be amenable to that so there's a little bit of wiggle room you're not so insulted by it, that it's a no it's just well let's both go do it, so I don't feel insulted. Okay, all right. If you presented it to her and said, if I can't figure out this behavior this anger this aggression, the way you treat your daughter, the way he treated me. looks like what i've seen in myself through drug use or the people that i've hung out with. I to go back in to this relationship, want to put it out of my head that drug uses any part of it, I need to get it out of my head, I need to rule it out, would you be willing to go, what do you think she might say."
3320.0,Patient,"she's offered to go and take one more. Okay, but I would never. You never. You know I just because i'm not done i'm not done that, over the years, pretty spot on when it comes to people that I hang around with and i'm trying to hide it, you know what I mean. i'm 99%. Always. All of these descriptors that I had it. sitting there saying that they weren't yeah everybody convinced that I was. thinking that they're using their back in jail possession and stuff like that they've been. given to me."
105.0,Provider,"So, remember, I asked you do you trust you may have misunderstood, but mask it again, do you trust your intuition about iris. you're trying to convince me notice the second one is I was right, I was right, I was right and I hear you, I know I actually do already started today with I already believe you I believe you. You don't. You question it and you're doubting it is what you're seeing real. What you saw is either acceptable or unacceptable it doesn't matter why whether it was drug induced or poor home training on poor anger management it doesn't matter what you saw as you sit in this hotel room away. from her what you saw is real it's enough to get you to leave I believe you. Do you need to have that behavior fixed and changed in order to be in that relationship. or yeah so you immediately started shaking your head, yes, so there's some clarity there there's behavior that's acceptable and there's behavior that's not. And you may have just run into it. You may have found a line a hard line that it's inconvenient because she's beautiful and intelligent fine and all these great things. And it's inconvenient. that she needs to do something she needs to heal address we don't know what it is that this behavior is a hard stop. Have you communicated that. not sure why, which is different because your style is this, you know I can't you know I can't because of my history now. that's what's motivating you for speaking don't do that one right it's this that's a hard know that behavior I can't be around it, I can't be in this relationship, until that behavior. is addressed. And I don't know where it's coming from and I don't want to guess i'm not the one doing it i'm doing my own thing i'm seeing a therapist and I don't especially like talking to her so sometimes. it's a pain in the ass, whatever your truth is, I want to hang up on most of the times, she makes me feel like shit brings up show and talk about show up anyway. and whatever levels of truth there's levels of truth that you want tell me, maybe you'll tell her Okay, I already know. That you guys have stuff and don't you know share with me, so what, but you can say. i'm working on my my anger i'm working on this thing with with getting defensive and i'm looking at it and I hate it. But i'm doing it, and I, in order to be in this relationship, I can't see I don't know what they are, for you Jay but if they are, I cannot see you be violent towards your daughter I can't can't see it towards me can't see it towards you don't want that violence. No mass don't want it can't have it i've already told you why i'm not going to go into that you know already is, you know why can't and then we put the responsibility where it belongs, on her shoulders, which is what is your plan to address this violence, if you get a response of. Your fucking crazy i'm not violent. You have your answer. there's not even taking influence or taking feedback there's no awareness that what's happening now why whether it's drug induced or not. is none of your business that's not for you to figure out. You knowing what you can tolerate or not, that it's enough to manage that, because we end up blurring it with the romantic love and lust and fantasies of forever love story stuff it's hard enough to hold on to your own boundary. But you found one and it might be violence, you were raised with violence, you violence, violence, violence, violence, you might just be done with it. And if she can't even see and have the humility and she can be crying throwing up when she says it, but if she can't say I cannot believe that I was violent to my daughter grabbing a child's hair is violent. It doesn't matter why. And if I keep hearing it i'm a mandated reporter and i'm going to report her. And i'm tempted to do so it's not okay you're right it's not and there are laws of finally the the. it's not acceptable, has risen to the point that there are laws to say it's not okay that little girl need not grow up with violence and this gets passed on another generation. That somehow this is acceptable and justified because of drug use, because you were in a bad mood it's not okay. it's not. All she's learning is to be violent or to be small."
3320.0,Patient,"My stepson remember the one Damien i've been telling you about. yeah I was talking to him about it, yes, you said."
105.0,Provider,Yes.
3320.0,Patient,"Oh, you broke up he's 17 yeah he's 17 and he was telling me because his mom acts, the same way that I respected that day that's how he is my Max so he's like yeah he doesn't like me that's my boy, you know I mean yeah I agree, I. used to you know I went to prison for wants to fly a call them all the time, you know to be there to talk. Anyway, he knows. But she's gonna she's gonna end up growing up in the same stuff exactly now. You know I mean it's gonna be the same situation. You don't get it like."
105.0,Provider,"That is also not her fault this didn't come out of the blue air. Finnair this comes from our prior generation she's not taught another way to be. And it's difficult thing to do for you to represent. Where you say it's not Okay, and you stick with it it's not okay it's not Okay, I have was treated this way it's not okay that other people to this way, no. let's find out new information about how to manage our frustration. or disappointment that turns out their substance use iris it's going to be damn near impossible for you to learn anything new, but that is still your issue to work out, I will be watching to see if there's violence now how you did it was it drug use or not, but is the violence. Violence was interesting I watched you iris go in the other room and take a deep breath I watched you say I need a few minutes to take a walk you put cold water on your face, you said sweetheart give me a background i'm losing my shit. I watched you iris you weren't violent you did these other things where'd you learn that i'm doing this i'm doing that, now that is tangible stuff we can go huh that's different. But convincing you that there's no violence. Now you're having to question your own reality and that's gaslighting and that's unhealthy. Not okay not trying to make you crazy. Yes, you have issues to you've got some learning to do and the things that I ask are hard. But you're being able to set a limit is something Maybe she needs to learn how to do too, and I don't know where that is for her so i've been talking a lot tell me what you're thinking about tell me what's happening to you as you're listening."
3320.0,Patient,"This whole time i've been. You know kinda like how you were saying. You know, drawing the line. That was. And at this point I just don't know that I tell her that oh."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
3320.0,Patient,Not not rude.
105.0,Provider,yeah.
3320.0,Patient,that's what i'm trying to do you want me to talk last night i'm like oh.
105.0,Provider,yeah.
3320.0,Patient,"And I I almost went out and spent $100 on a little beater car, but it runs. As they're. Just so that I give my suburban from my experiment. me just trying to. I just don't know how to eat it. that's not okay it's not I don't care if she's not my daughter. know what I mean."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
3320.0,Patient,I don't know I haven't seen.
105.0,Provider,"think the hope J and it's for most people is that we will be able, with our words. to persuade. Oh look what i've been through. to persuade you know, to convince someone right The hope is if I say it, if I talk about what it did to be and and and Look how angry I get and I might go to jail. No, we want it to work. What you do do the line that you're saying you're drawing and that's the leaving. And that's hard for you, because it sounds it means you might lose the relationship. But you're going to get some self respect that talking that you're worth being respected won't do either you actually protecting your body and your emotional space. By not letting people try to gaslight you. or being around violence is a testament so much more powerful than an empty promise I won't do it again. But you say no. i'm not going to I I am deserving no more or less than anyone else, but of being treated kindly. doing it has a lot more credibility than talking about it. And I know or, I imagine, I know how hard it is to do that, because you want the good things that come from a romantic relationship and you guys wanted to house and I get the fantasy there was starting to brew your. And if this is just an opportunity for you to say there were signs that I ignored I won't ignore them again and just get back out there. And it's no different than some of the other conversations, which is. The pool is a little smaller it's a smaller town, you know that but it's still worth it, this is your sanity this is your peace of mind this is your life. This is your freedom that's at stake. So I also will support you and be here, you want to go in again sometimes people do they say well i'm not too sure, maybe I still can't trust my gut. i'm asking too much i'd rather test it out and see if she really gets it this time I scared her I pulled away now she's really scared to lose me. i'll still be here. Okay i'll support you if you want to work on communication skills with iris i'm here. Okay, these are hard choices and hope, by no means, am I saying oh just say goodbye go find someone else it's not that easy. it's really hard you have love invested in us."
3320.0,Patient,Everything everything that i've got going on.
105.0,Provider,"And that's not her fault. You participated in that, and so it's just a moment of reflection right to say well. it's just."
3320.0,Patient,"crazy that feels something that. that's. If I even told you to stop for you. I tried, I tried and that's that's. that's why i'm having the hardest time. All time. yeah yeah slamming my mom's dorie Clark i'm issues."
105.0,Provider,"Well she's not emotionally regulating herself the effect is you feel disrespectful, but this is a woman who's not able to manage her impulses. Yes, drugs do that I don't know anything else about her accept your suspicion, but she's not managing impulses that needs to be addressed right away. Saying i'm sorry doesn't work you've got to see evidence that she's managing her impulses the same way, you would want to be measured, the same way right. i'm catching myself saying it's getting hot if you keep provoking I can feel it i'm gonna just violent solution is going to come up in me. And you go walk you go leave go manage your own impulses. We have to manage our own. And you gave her an opportunity to be helpful to offer a reminder."
3320.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"ouch painful moment. Can we shift the thinking a little bit of my check and see what you're actually doing with your minutes in the day, what are you doing. As you're moving through this difficult conflict with her, what are you doing throughout the day, what are you doing to turn your attention to other things that are productive."
3320.0,Patient,"My first my first night here I locked three keys in my room, I had to go and buy two extras I was, I was last last. next day to I didn't get much sleep. that's why a group I was. Barely yesterday today i'm. starting to feel at least last year. that's what i'm waiting for that to kind of live by go talk to. ya know. Talking on straightening motion."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
3320.0,Patient,"She she hurt my feelings. Because you're in I mean, so I want to go ahead. You know I mean, I want to give you the facts facts on one play no games around the bush. That are no, we should not okay. If you're not have. You will know. And that's why I can't be you're not going to change the beginning. and ending on I don't know I don't. i'm still."
105.0,Provider,it's still a little fuzzy on what you're what you're asking for from our do you notice that in yourself.
3320.0,Patient,yeah yeah. She made me feel like. I mean.
105.0,Provider,Can I. Can I can I remind.
3320.0,Patient,talk. Go ahead.
105.0,Provider,"There is an interruption in our connection is not perfect, sometimes I don't catch everything you say. Do you remember me saying that again we have to caveat kind of put in brackets possible substance use so it's there. that's the unknown factor, but in general, when we're desperate we you see me do this, we show we show people that we're having an emotion and we actually get this other person to feel like we do so if we use that theory and we say well if i'm feeling this big like a piece of shit. iris. What do you think of you. Because it's very possible she is feeling that small."
3320.0,Patient,"that's what. She said, I want to feel like i've."
105.0,Provider,"got nothing to do with make so that's where you guys go and that's, if I may. I don't want to offend you I can't afford to offend you because you'll disappear on me so. If you can hold that and don't go any further from it and just say I get it, you want me to feel like you feel. Tell me more How is it that you feel small. How is it you felt small before you grabbed her hair, will you feeling that small. So do you see the difference of what I can do when i'm not offended I can keep asking questions I in it physically it's a leaning in oh hmm I want to understand more because i'm now i'm not guarded up and now i'm like I want to understand that what happened. i'm just curious about it. She doesn't know what's going on with her, she has about the the the awareness of self as a child does just like her daughter no awareness of it she's just passing that along she doesn't know. she's making you feel it maybe you'll know and you'll tell her This is how the unconscious works it's slick. But we do want an answer, we want to know, we want to have agency, in a sense of control or mind. We want it it's just really hard. it's the anger and the fear that gets in the way, so when you say, I want to take some time minutes days to get out of my reptilian brain so that I can have access. To my prefrontal cortex and I can be thinking about the consequences of actions and inactions into the future, a smart part of your brain and it's a great idea. it's a great idea what that other part of the brain did for you is get you out of there so i'm grateful to it, and now there's time and that's what you need some time to think about it. knowing what you want, not leveraging hoping that your motivation is the same as hers and what I mean by that is. i'm going to get violent on up in jail you hope that that will motivate her to stop. it's not going to work. Well, could work for you is being really clear and taking these days or minutes I don't know how long you're going to take and thinking about the question I asked that you're having trouble with, which is what you want to see. You say this little phrase get help. Well, I got I got help that's all she has to say that oh I got it I got it I got my help. i'm fine i'll never happen again. Is that what you're looking for. Do you want to see. hmm what does help look like when you said you need to get some help iris What do you mean what do you want to actually see."
3320.0,Patient,It tells me. She told me she.
105.0,Provider,"going to take my pen. What do you want, what do you want sorry. Probably not hearing each other again iris if you do this, and this, it will say to me you're getting the help with this violence, what is it that you want to see."
3320.0,Patient,"I don't want to see that. So i'm gonna tell you what she could do, but there's not just one thing you can do it, you know."
105.0,Provider,One well at least pick one what's something you would like to see read. One more time.
3320.0,Patient,Talk to a therapist I don't.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so it might be hey in order to continue even talking about whether we're going to be together, I need to know who you called to try and schedule an appointment. that's the start that says to me you're taking seriously what what the gravity of what's happening right now period and the and the interesting thing is you don't have to explain why. that's the beauty of really being centered in a boundary I don't have to explain i've gotten very clear over these days staying in this hotel, I know I know where my line is, I cannot hear. i'm sorry, with no action there's safety issues going on here there's freedom issues going on here what i'm looking for is like to hear the names of the people and what appointments are available and. that'll show me that's a start that's number one number two is probably going to be that you went or you drug my ass with you, I don't know, maybe I don't trust you for a hot second maybe you take me with you. I don't know, but that would work that starts to feel like there's something tangible that I can measure and see you're taking this seriously. These empty apologies are just that they're empty. So that's what I was getting at is this tangible. And i'm I was sort of imagining for you how difficult that would be to ask someone to do something like that."
3320.0,Patient,"that's where i'm at the point where, if they can't if they can't seek it for themselves."
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
3320.0,Patient,Then I mean I can't force somebody just like people couldn't force me to get off drugs just by putting me. just go so.
105.0,Provider,"So and hold on to that and don't well let's stay with this show you really see that what your therapist just now did. was set a boundary it was not. Telling someone what to do, i'm going to do it again because there's a an important distinction. i'm sharing if i'm you i'm saying iris. i've taken a lot of time to think about this. i'm very tempted to believe that the. apology means."
3320.0,Patient,insight.
105.0,Provider,"And then. All of a sudden, you have new skills on how to manage your frustration. But i'm realistic. I need. To not be around you until. I see that you are taking action you're going to decide whether to do it or not, but that's what i'm going to be looking for that's what i'm going to be measuring so see the difference. I have a right to look at what I want to look at they have a right to do it or not do it in how i'm saying it. This is how I measuring she has every right to come back and say, well, I don't want to do that, but here's. Would this work for you would this look like it was a tangible evidence of taking this seriously if I left my daughter was said it so and so and I went to blah blah blah blah blah blah. I don't know she might have an idea, and you might think. Well, I don't hate that I kind of like that too that's. Pretty cool idea I like that yeah. follow through with that. I might start to trust you might might start to believe. That you're taking this seriously, she may have an even better idea. If you stay open to it. But the my whole point is just because I. say this is what I want it's not a directive. It it's not me bossing. iris around it, saying. This is what I would need to see. it's up to them, she wants to do it, she may say well you're trippin. i'm not doing it okay that's certainly you're right but i've spent these days, thinking about how do I enter back into this relationship, I want some confidence, and I think my confidence might come from you getting professional help. Because I don't trust you. And yes, she has a choice to do it or not, and it sucks but being direct like this, where we lay it out right out there's no ambiguity, which means fuzzy about what help looks like it's right out here. Well, this is what I would be looking she may have an even better idea, you might say, I might well how about how about it's this you might go from last night I could start to trust if I saw a little bit of that too. You can stay open. But it's a start start to say, these are the things I need to see. Because what you've been operating on before is the hope that your pain and suffering is enough to motivate her to not hurt you. We wish that would work and this way you tell her look what I could be imprisoned don't you don't you love me don't let it get this bad I might I might be violent. alright. yeah it's it's a subtle difference. But it's I think it's important, especially with you that it is really clear, this is not a demand. She still has the right to do whatever she wants to put this a consequence, it means you may not trust her and you may not enter back into the relationship, the way it was before she has a choice. She can say i'm not ready to do that I don't wanna Okay, but you, you were clear you did the best you could to be as clear and we did that today we got clear. You went from get some help to go to a therapist that specific. i'm going to need to see it. to feel more comfortable to feel safe around you. And i'll be looking for, and this is me not you i'll be looking for, remember, I was saying, for about evidence that there are healthy skills being learned, I will see you. Maybe being frustrated or impatient and i'll see you doing some things that are healthy ways to cope with frustration and anger. And I will move closer and trust you more I will be moving this way, but right now i'm watching. I need to draw a line i'm scared i'm scared i'll be violent i'm scared all her to schedule hurt me i'm scared to be back at barisan. i'm working on this stuff myself. This is if that's your truth obviously i'm making this all up but."
3320.0,Patient,or.
105.0,Provider,"Tough tough stuff. I hope she loves herself enough to take in. What you have to say. I hope you love yourself enough to stand up for your right for safety. She don't have to explain it, this is a kind of a God given thing or a you know if you believe in God I just like the phrase. Born born given. Okay anything more here at the end to process. Okay, I wish I could make it easier for you. Can hard the hard one. All right, um we have one two how about. Right now, I have."
