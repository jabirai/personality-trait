726.0,Provider,For Sean McDonald. hey.
5797.0,Patient,My fault Hello.
726.0,Provider,hi how are you.
5797.0,Patient,i'm hanging in there. i'm doing good today.
726.0,Provider,How is how has your week been.
5797.0,Patient,"i'm a challenge well actually we saw each other, last Friday."
726.0,Provider,So so far it's.
5797.0,Patient,"it's been a challenge, I guess. yeah i'm. To be honest, just really trying to do the assignment. And really just trying to think. And so I wrote something down, but then. It just kind of got me to really thinking um."
726.0,Provider,Let me just pull it up real.
5797.0,Patient,"Quick just because. I think that was what my challenge was was based around that. So what I basically said was like I titled it where do I feel safe. I was trying to meditate on it think about it all of that, and what I wrote was thinking about if and where I have felt safe, it was hard for me to think about. Because I realized i've never truly felt safe so it's hard to say where I felt safe before. um and I came to that conclusion, I said that, last night I type that out last night. um is because, through the week through the weekend I basically just started going backwards, you know, like think about in my 30s think about in my 20s think about situations in my life, and then I started to try to say ages, you know. Like Okay, you know 10 what was going on, when I was 10 and I just kept feeling like no there was no real safe area space, I went to like five six. No, I never really trusted people so, and so it just brought me back to a whole like. It came I came to the realization or the I realized. That and. My loss of trust in adults and people. started very young. Okay, so because of that, and where I came to that conclusion is I can remember it was interesting because I was actually watching a show that might sound funny, but it really I like it, because it. brings up subjects that. You could put in your day to day life it's. Marriage boot camp. And I you know, and I watch I like those types of shows, and so I want. The Hollywood the hip hop version. And that is what triggered me thinking about this."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, that."
5797.0,Patient,"at a very young age, I stopped trusting. Because there was the subject matter or one of the can. You know, one of the contestants little mo I don't know if you know who she is, but I know her father so because her father's a famous rapper of my era. You know I. and her father's Kool moe Dee so I don't know if you know who he is I. Think so he's a rapper in the 80s. Like he you know big Daddy kane and biggie. smalls and puff Daddy and like that genre."
726.0,Provider,"That era Okay, you know."
5797.0,Patient,"What that error so because I know her father, I know her she's more of a younger hip hop rapper girl right. So it was just interesting because there was a subject where they were talking about how your childhood experiences will affect you or your childhood traumas can affect you in your relationships when you're an adult. Especially in romantic relationships. And so they were doing little things you know they had his color stuff and all that, but it hit me because, when she said to explain her, she was like my father was my number one fan like he was my road dog, but I was scared of what he might do. To someone that has hurt me so one of the things was he had been touched as a young girl, but she was too afraid to tell her father, because she she knew her father would kill them. You know, like."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
5797.0,Patient,was like that's my baby girl.
726.0,Provider,You know.
5797.0,Patient,"Like if she was on the playground, and she got hit by a boy push down in the playground her father, would be the one to come and be like you know and so."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5797.0,Patient,"He realize, even though he was in her corner, she was scared to tell him about anything that has happened to her and her mother was very nonchalant like shit happens things happen like get over it like you're repeating it you're going too far you're exaggerating kind of thing. yeah when she said that. I started crying. And that. Because that's exactly how my childhood was. My mom was very nonchalant about everything. anything and everything that happened to me and my father was very. He scared me it."
726.0,Provider,"And it made me so, then I pulled back out my phone and I looked at."
5797.0,Patient,"The question again. And I said wow. I just realized that at a very young age, due to the trauma that I went through when I was in second grade, so I was about maybe six seven ish around that. Second grade. And the response that my father did. I didn't realize it traumatized me like I didn't realize that it. Was that fear of. I can't tell my dad is boy called me ugly you know, or like. yeah in your mind you're thinking you know I can't tell my my dad that this girl stepped on my toe and in class. yeah my go and hurt her. Because it's interpretation of a child, not as an adult's. there's no opening there. yeah so it just really got me to realize I don't think i've ever truly felt safe. And then I asked my myself why like what was going on, that you never felt safe and. I felt comfortable in some places, but I never felt relaxed or safe in the sense of like something's not going to happen to me. yeah I remember being startled awake like nobody ever gently woke me up. It was lights on bells whistling screaming get your ass up like. startled awake so I can never fully relax and go to sleep. You know, and then, as I got older I started having kids young so, then I had children that I couldn't really relax and sleep in. So it's one of those where it's like wow I don't remember like i'm sure I was. yeah I just don't remember like was I so young, that it is not in my conscious mind. Do you know kind of what i'm saying like. yeah I can remember about five six ish of kind of like you know, like people would be like come here, you know it's okay i'm not going to hurt you as soon as I hear those words i'm not going to hurt you or everything's okay you're safe I instantly with backup."
726.0,Provider,Like a red flag for you.
5797.0,Patient,"I get not knowing it, not realizing it. You know what i'm saying like when I was young it's not like I say oh you're not safe, because you said those words know as an adult. Thinking about it, reflecting on it, saying I that must have been a trigger word for me or state. or me. Because I couldn't remember meeting people. And that was the generation everybody, you know you hug everyone that's your uncle hug them, you know. On their laps all that kind of stuff and I never was a kid that felt comfortable doing that."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, all."
5797.0,Patient,"I remember, being a daddy's girl, I was always with my dad everywhere, up until that incident. That was."
726.0,Provider,me.
5797.0,Patient,"It really changed to be um. I was OK, so I was on school bus and the school bus that we had is the you know the yellow buses. So you can, if you know the yellow buses, you know how the seats are. yeah okay um and it's you know so it's very different than city buses, but i'm in second grade they were fifth graders on my bus so."
726.0,Provider,"Of course, I went to."
5797.0,Patient,"elementary school that had preschool all the way up to sixth grade okay so i'm on the bus and there was like two boys and front. two boys behind. i'm sitting in the middle seat, and one of the boys who's sitting next to me so i'm by the window. Okay, and they all just. tore my you know tore my. soul to me. And I got off the bus I just kind of like. I didn't really know what. happened to me I just knew that I. Was uncomfortable and I was worried that. My dad was going to be upset because my outfit torn. Not that I had busted lip and my hair was a mess and just that my clothes dirty. And I walked in the door, and my dad looked at me and just went like completely off like he wouldn't even let me go to the bathroom he was screaming at you know what Fuck happened and. Who yeah to you, and he went to his gun he had like this, you know, like whatever and he grabbed it and unlocked it the open it up and it got a shotgun pistol in is like he just started grabbing guns, to me it was like he was describing a whole bunch. yeah no."
726.0,Provider,"it's okay. I have a dog too, and she doesn't save my God."
5797.0,Patient,"Right um. And then he grabbed me and walked me down the street like we lived in you know in our little neighborhood and went door to door you show me where these were these boys live and he's like click click click on the doors. Open up and he's like you tell these little motherfucker next time they do this to my dog and like he just but the whole event of him. ranking mean from door to door right so angry like I thought he was going to kill someone. Okay, because of his his anger it scared me. And at that point. Like I went into a state of I stopped talking. I stopped eating solid foods, I stopped talking I didn't talk to anyone. Like I became very just I was scared to tell say anything because I thought that, like something was going to happen because of my words, so I completely. I mean like. My teachers would send me home she won't talk, you know. I got weapons I got sent to my room I got like I got punished, so it wasn't like they just allowed they just and they gave up and I stopped talking like I didn't do a single thing all I did was just sit in my room. You know, and like they would all my name and I raised my hand, but I would not verbally respond I didn't talk to my friends, I didn't talk to adults, I didn't talk to anyone."
726.0,Provider,When that event happened the let's say the bus driver was there a monitor on the bus at all or or at that time was it just the kids and the bus driver and the bus driver didn't see anything.
5797.0,Patient,"I don't know if the bus driver saw anything or not, to be honest. After that day, I know I got kicked off the bus a couple of times because I brought what they said weapons. I I took a fork and I can't move forward with me everywhere. Okay um. which I tried to turn around as being a funny thing. When I was doing T shirts and stuff I used to come up with you know back off don't make me have to fork you. Can but it came out of. A real event like. I that I thought that you know so every time those boys tried to approach me I pulled out my fork you know I mean people would laugh at me, but I was six. You know I thought that's how you defend yourself. And if anyone told me anything I would just it's a fork it's not a weapon it's a fork."
726.0,Provider,But.
5797.0,Patient,"The fact that I sharpens the edges, to make it more like a knife. That is what scares people is like kept weapons on me knives were my favorite thing to carry."
726.0,Provider,"And molly was that the first time, you were ever salted ever or was there anything before that happened that that you would say was."
5797.0,Patient,"inappropriate. yeah i've always had inappropriate touch in my life um but that's the first time I can remember actually being assaulted. You know where I could put my finger and say these boys did this, you know."
726.0,Provider,"How young were you, the first time, you were ever assaulted."
5797.0,Patient,I believe I was like five six.
726.0,Provider,That incident.
5797.0,Patient,"But i've always remembered just creepy guys around me, you know, like. yeah nothing you could put your finger on but they just the way they look at me was like, why are you looking at me. ya know, and I was like maybe come out the bathroom you may be staring at me like they're drooling or something like it was just creepy just creaminess I come out the bath or the bathtub or the shower or something and they'd be in the bathroom with me why are you in the bathroom. yeah just those types of creepiness you know."
726.0,Provider,"Well it's a supervision, like in your home that. Was it like. On."
5797.0,Patient,"Like I grew up in party family like. People were always in and out of our House, we were always around people like. My mom worked a lot my mom was always working. My dad he usually came home about anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour after I got home from school. like an elementary. You know i'm I do remember having a babysitter. But I think it was probably I don't remember if it was after that incident or before the incident."
726.0,Provider,It had to have been after.
5797.0,Patient,"But you know so it's like things where I do remember coming home and the guy I have to pass His name was frank, but he was my dad's fishing buddy he was the creepy guys that was always around that just. And it started out with being creepy. It started out with. Being i'm just inappropriate language for a child. yeah you know and then try to. You guys hi josh."
726.0,Provider,Give me a second okay.
5797.0,Patient,"you're asked enough. i'll make me have to put you in your CRATE. hey man i'm. He was the about. i'm trying to remember exactly how old I was I don't really remember, I think I was maybe seven or eight at this point when he tried to. pull me into his house. And he. lowered me into. My his house and. yeah it was crazy because he, like pull this pants down. Any and shorts on which was he was creepy because he would he would never wear underwear he'd wear these shorts shorts this is back in the 80s so. Short, back then, it was put like one leg up. So you could see between his. His shorts you know. yeah and you can see nothing but i'm like you know, like i'm not supposed to be looking at you, I don't think this is appropriate, you know and he'd be like do you do you see something you like and i'd be like i'm i'm. Like he was creepy like that. yeah. You know what's wrong with you, you know you don't want me to tell your dad that you know you're not you're being mean to me, you know you'll be up he'll be upset because the rule was you know you're a child you're supposed to be respectful to adults. It was that big thing like he had me I realize now, it was grooming."
726.0,Provider,Right yeah.
5797.0,Patient,"And he probably was groomed me for a while. Before I was aware of it. yeah but yeah so it's just it's one of those so that my mom didn't care my mom got to a point when she would lock me out of the House, she never wanted me there. Like I had no curfew when it came to my mom I could come in and out as long as I was invisible around her as long as I was out of sight out of mind, I was fine I could pretty much get away with anything as long as my mom didn't see me."
726.0,Provider,we'll be right back just for a few or my. Other siblings.
5797.0,Patient,"Just with me. my brother that my parents adopted when I was seven. um was my mom's favorite like he could literally do no wrong. And he did some wrong. Things that would have said, like, I would have been blocked up for. got him out of. You know. drinking and yakking right, you know driving his car and over a bridge into the water almost killing himself. He should have been charged for the damage that he did, and my mom got him off. You know I mean just things like that."
726.0,Provider,"what's your relationship like, with your family at this point as an adult I know you said you're not in contact as much."
5797.0,Patient,"it's very what's that word a strange I guess. I was talking to my my sister my older sister. Last night and. yeah it's just crazy because my. Our family is so broken that like we are you over stuff that's like ridiculous and we're not very close, but my father's ill, so my father's at his his end and. My mom's brother. made it very clear that they are not going to take care of my father, if anything happens to my mother. Like if because I guess she's been having strokes she's been having heart attacks or something like mild strokes and you know it's this was a couple years ago I guess um and yeah they made it very clear that it would be up to my sister and I to take care of our father. And so they built relationship after they became adults, because i've helped that connection, you know. But we're like my father's family does not like my mother at all they're angry with my father, for being with my mom um and allowing her to do as much damage as she has in the family. Like they're angry at. The things that have happened to me. they're upset."
726.0,Provider,With my father. You know yeah.
5797.0,Patient,"yeah yeah those kinds of things and so. We don't really have a relationship like and because of that my older children and I don't have a relationship and it's extremely hard for me. You know. yeah um so it's just I don't want to continue that cycle. yeah but I don't there's nothing I can do. You know, all I can do is try to be better for me so that as the new generations grow up and get older I can try to change some of this."
726.0,Provider,Yes.
5797.0,Patient,To try to connect with the least my grandkids and I still have my youngest you know Kim and I are extremely close.
726.0,Provider,"I think you know, especially with relationships and family it's you can do as much as you can to try to hope that. That but, at the end of the day it ourselves that we do have control over and how we want to be in relationship with them and sometimes it's not the way we would want we. Or, or they don't see. The hurt or they're not they're not putting the significance of the past and. So. yeah."
5797.0,Patient,"And it kind of sends me because. I wish that I had some form of communication relationship with my mom you know, I would like to be able to be there for her. You know i'm. i'm sure she's had some sorrows in her life, you know I mean it would help me I guess and and give me some closure if I knew why she disliked me so much you know or. I mean like. And I mean for real like. Was I can see through rate. And that, and she just never told anyone, you know. yeah so every time she sees me, it reminds her of that if that's the case, I can get it. I want to be there for my mom."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5797.0,Patient,I want to tell her that it wasn't her fault and love her. She doesn't have to hold that pain.
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah have you asked your uncle or maybe had a conversation with him, like you, they know that that's how you feel about your relationship with your mother."
5797.0,Patient,"They don't care that's the thing my mother's brother, which is my uncle there's only two of them. Okay, my mom and his her brother, are the only children from her parents. yeah unless of course you've got other step sisters or brothers from my father, but um. yeah he's never liked me he's never liked my father never and he makes it very clear that he does not like us. Because we are of color he makes it very clear, he says that i'm ghetto. And he doesn't want him in and he doesn't want me to know his children."
726.0,Provider,He doesn't want to know.
5797.0,Patient,"My children, he doesn't you know."
726.0,Provider,That wow.
5797.0,Patient,yeah he makes it very clear that he does not like my father um. yeah it's just very interesting cuz yeah he just owns one of his own daughters because she's gay.
726.0,Provider,Oh wow.
5797.0,Patient,"So he was like I don't know what's wrong with our blood. To my mom like I don't know what's wrong with our blood. DNA, you have a gay child that's all fucked up and she doesn't know what she wants to be and I have one that I think. You know, got influenced, and this and that, I mean like he really just does not like us. which I think is very interesting but. um. yeah I have a weird family. But it's, not just because you know. He blamed me for tainting his daughter my cousin."
726.0,Provider,"Why, how did he come to that."
5797.0,Patient,"conclusion because his daughter, and I have always had a tight cousin relationship."
726.0,Provider,We would write letters to each other and talk on the phone and. You know my cousin the his.
5797.0,Patient,"son so we've got two daughters and a son our birthdays are day apart. So i've always kind of tried to have a relationship with him. By him being a boy. It never really worked too much their mother, my aunt before they divorced before my uncle and my aunt forced her and I were like this, like, I was in their wedding she adored me. She used to like love putting stuff in my hair like. We had a connection and nobody can understand how I could have a connection with family that weren't blood. You know. yeah but I couldn't have connection with my own blood and I said because they don't like me. i'm I don't I don't react, the way I didn't react, the way typical kids reacted. You know I didn't go and play like typical kids went and play that. You know. There was a lot of things I didn't know because nobody took the time to teach me how to do certain things I had to guess on my own and nobody corrected me. So I didn't have a lot. of guidance. I put it that way, a dad was. Always working you know, he was drinking and a hustler and party in and that's what we did every weekend there's a party. You know. yeah so it was just that was the LIFE pretty much just take care of ourselves. My dad was the cook so my dad always came home and he cooked in mix. We always had food like stuff like that."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5797.0,Patient,"But we would eat in front of the TV nobody would conversation nobody would talk there wasn't how was your day at school, how was your day at work, it was never that. yeah it was you come home you get self you know your clothes off because my dad had very old fashioned rules. Take your school clothes off and all of that you jump in the shower to wash off all the dirt and stuff for the day get ready for dinner you eat dinner, and then you go into your room and study. Without being checked on."
726.0,Provider,Ah.
5797.0,Patient,You just go into your room. yeah once it's time for adult time which usually was like eight nine o'clock we weren't allowed to come out of our room. I see you know kind all. Now.
726.0,Provider,did things happen when you were in your room when it was supposed to be study time that were that were inappropriate.
5797.0,Patient,yeah if people had came over yes always my door was always you know people were always walking into my room. I never had privacy.
726.0,Provider,Okay.
5797.0,Patient,"There was no privacy, you know yeah yeah and for whatever reason, they didn't like me to close my door."
726.0,Provider,Your pants.
5797.0,Patient,"yeah they never like don't close your door why there's no reason for you to need privacy, you know i've seen it I changed your diapers like it was that type of philosophy like. yeah you know."
726.0,Provider,"I went child was there ever any one adult that did that you felt comfortable with, even if you didn't truly feel safe with anybody anyone that you felt actually comfortable with it, you you knew that they weren't going to try to hurt you in any form."
5797.0,Patient,"Yes, there was a few and every time they would come into my life. My parents my mom made sure that they didn't stay. So I stopped getting connected to. People because I knew they wouldn't stay around. Oh, my God mother was, I would say she was. She was like a mother to me. nurturing she was loving. She was the one that be like you know how's your summer going how's your day at school, how you know what did you eat did it ended up I didn't find out till later that my God mom was actually my mom and dad's girlfriend and that I grew up in a poly family. Was it was."
726.0,Provider,All right.
5797.0,Patient,"For me. You know. It was always either her kids at my house or i'm over there, you know um my my brother my younger brother he never left his room he hated to be around people."
726.0,Provider,and
5797.0,Patient,Anti social.
726.0,Provider,and think any of your siblings experience on the stuff that you had experienced.
5797.0,Patient,"My older siblings the ones from my father. i'm not gonna say they haven't they didn't experience the same thing, because they didn't grow up with me so they didn't experience what I experienced in that sense, but i'm sure that they've experienced inappropriate touch or language or something in that manner. um yeah I wonder about my younger brother. I always wondered about him of. like what happened with him, you know. um. yeah and I I have, I used to have a lot of guilt, I still kind of hold on to some of the guild's around the time I was being abused about five six years old um. I always wondered would I carry that on with my children. So when I was about. 1010 years old, maybe a little old event 1011 maybe cuz I was seven when he was born. So when he was like probably. I don't know four or five. yeah there was someone in our lives that basically. told me if I didn't do something to him. They were going to do something bad to me. And then nobody would believe me, because nobody believed me before. And I remember not wanting to do it. And so I said, well, can he just touched my my chest. And they said, as long as we can watch and so they feel."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
5797.0,Patient,"and was told for many years that this is going to be my blackmail, if I ever tried to expose this person. They wouldn't, believe me, because this would be the blackmail. This would be the proofs. yeah I never said anything. Then I tried to go to my mom and tell her what was happening, and she said shit happens get over it bad things happen to us. Lives very quick I can't go to my mom every time I try to tell my mom that people are saying things are making me feel uncomfortable or. I don't want to go over their house or. I don't want you to do that she slapped me and tell me, I have no choice they'll be disrespectful. So it was a very just hard time so yeah. But my God mother she's the one, and then there was this one other lady I don't remember her name. But she was friends of my parents. And she saw how I was being treated and she said that to me anytime you want to come to my house, I will not tell your parents that you're here, I will not. And so I used to run away and go to her house."
726.0,Provider,I want each to just start running away.
5797.0,Patient,Oh wow I think the first time I was like probably seven. And they stopped me at the corner was my abuser that stopped me at the corner. I lived in a dead end so.
726.0,Provider,I had to go.
5797.0,Patient,"back you know, and he was like turn back around or come into my house. So I turned back around. And then another time I left school. And went over to my my. mom's friends house. yeah and I was gone for a week and my dad went off when he finally found me. You know don't scare me like that in this mat so I continuously over time kept trying to leave and run away, and this is what I kept telling the courts, I kept telling the group homes and all these different places. You know i'd rather live on the streets, because they would threaten me they go well you're just going to be homeless that's better than live in where i'm at."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5797.0,Patient,"And they they I just never understood why all these adults that are supposed to protect children couldn't see. what's going on, like it's not normal for child to completely stop talking."
726.0,Provider,And I think that they saw something and. Where we're like not wanting to realize the gravity of what was happening.
5797.0,Patient,"yeah in denial like forced denial I just don't want to deal with it, I got I don't have time to deal with it. was more of the attitude I feel."
726.0,Provider,"I almost wonder, too, if your mother was a victim of abuse, because her reaction. The way that it that your."
5797.0,Patient,"reaction. Time on I know I know I know I know getting all worked up, I know, calm down. he sees another ball outside."
726.0,Provider,"All right, hi baby."
5797.0,Patient,Calm down calm down baby.
726.0,Provider,"And like I don't want you to think that i'm. You know i'm just here, trying to like find out everything about you. it's more because. we're going to do any processing in the future it's good to understand the history because I don't want to bring something up or have something in session. And then be like Oh, but this happened, you know and then have that trigger something else so that's why I i'm curious about your experience in your ages, because it'll inform me kind of where you were at that time as well. Okay yeah um."
5797.0,Patient,it's strange because sometimes I feel like i'm stuck in those ages. With some events in my life.
726.0,Provider,"Give me a more, the most recent time when you felt that way."
5797.0,Patient,"um. I say my last two relationships. there's two relationships that were very distinctive that I remember. There was a third one, but that was when I was younger um. I just felt like a 12 year old little girl. all the time. I was always asking for like guidance and. Wanting instruction like if I was a child. Okay um. I think that's where my my King side or my bd sm side kicked in. And I was like snuck in that mode of. I need you to. be like my guardian like to tell me what to do, kind of a thing."
726.0,Provider,But yeah for of like how.
5797.0,Patient,"Like I acted like a teenager very much. I felt like me to nature. And just the things that I wanted, like the things I wanted to do the way that I felt the. How I got emotional about the things that I got emotional about i'm. always looking for approval. And it just reminds me after I was through it all after it was all over. yeah reflecting back. I was like wow I was like stuck in this teenage kind of. thing yeah like I went back in time kind of thing and it's. A lot of its kind of cloudy. You know, it seems more like a dream. yeah but then people would talk to me about it and say, oh no, you were very much ABC D and i'd be like I was there, like you, don't remember when this happened, or that happened i'd be like no I just remember feeling a certain way around that."
726.0,Provider,"might have been too. dissociated so like when. When you're in. When you're in the middle of it and you're overwhelmed and a lot of emotions are coming up sometimes you will dissociate and it's just like you're in the routine of things, but you're not really there you're just like. Yes, there were not really like there."
5797.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
726.0,Provider,"Oh lovely what I wanted to do now, because I wanna I don't want it and everything because it's pretty heavy the stuff that we've been talking about so i'm gonna do i'm watching to do this exercise with me today, so we can just kind of like wrap it up until I meet with you for next week. Okay Okay, so all of these what we're gonna do is I want you to imagine storage boxes or units Okay, it can look, however, you want, you can have different colors you can have plastic bins it can be, it can be a warehouse if you want okay. What I want you to do is I want. You to you could close your eyes, but you can lightly these down here like that. and imagine that all of the things that we talked about today you're putting it safely in a little in it could be a little box or it could be a big box. Okay, I want you to put them in boxes all right. Okay, and what I want you to do is, as you do, that you say to yourself that in another time we will revisit them, and right now we're going to put them away."
5797.0,Patient,Okay.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so so however you feel comfortable, I just want you to take a deep breath in. In phantom four. And let it out. And i'm going to stay quiet and you're gonna do this boxing okay. And then, when you're ready, you can come back and just let me know what you've got. How did that feel when you were doing that."
5797.0,Patient,um. Good actually it was funny because I was picturing myself after I put the stuff in the boxes. Taking a spray bottle of Florida water like.
726.0,Provider,spraying it on yeah.
5797.0,Patient,Being around the box and.
726.0,Provider,All yeah.
5797.0,Patient,So we don't get any excess dirt and so that's why I was chuckling because I was like that's so weird that I would instantly think once we put it in the box let's wipe the box down and sweep around it. or use Florida water for everything.
726.0,Provider,"And I know that when you start getting overwhelmed with emotions for things are coming up for you that you feel like you can't handle at that moment. You can do this exercise, like you can do it anytime during the day, so you start feeling overwhelmed you start feeling anxious like feel out of control, all right. What would I be doing if I have to think of it your imagination is endless you can do whatever you want, in your imagination so. If if I know it's an imaginary exercise for what you're really doing is you're telling your body. it's Okay, I know that you're there I know you're scared I know you're worried for right now we're going to put you away because I we can't I don't have the time right now to deal with this right now. So you're putting it in boxes, so that we can process it in a way that feels safe and feels more. Like rigid or restricted because when you think about feeling safe sometimes feeling safe is having rules have it having boundaries and when we're feeling out of control, we feel totally up here and we don't feel grounded here on like Planet Earth, you know so. Think about this and I know. We talked about safe place right, so what we're going to work with this, because it's good to know now I know if we're looking at a safe place right or we want to create a place that feels safe. We have that maybe we haven't found it yet, but this is God you're you're processing this information, so we can work with it."
5797.0,Patient,Right okay.
726.0,Provider,So um.
5797.0,Patient,I also wanted to say one other thing.
726.0,Provider,"I was thinking through this process, I was also."
5797.0,Patient,"If I took a piece of paper and visualize because I do a lot of visualization i'm boxes and maybe words in the boxes, so when I see it. So that when I start to get overwhelmed. it's a visual way of me to be able to say. we're going to put this in the box. Yes, and we'll deal with this later. Because we've got this to deal with. yeah, what do you think about that as having. Like a visual reminder. I."
726.0,Provider,"Think that's great, I think, because a lot of times, if you are visualizing something if it's something tactile that you can find it so the, but if you think of like an animal an animal has all. kinds of fighter flight. You eaten too. Right so so is just like a child that may seek comfort from having a teddy bear because it's soft it's the same thing, what you're talking about if you have something to see visually that can help you organize it that's perfect. that's perfect. Okay yep. Okay, so. So I wanted to just really um. I wanted like peacefully and close out the session so if you are comfortable Okay, you can do this, you can do this at home, you can do this, whenever you want his hands a heart and other hand, on your stomach. Yes, yeah."
5797.0,Patient,that's a reiki thing yeah.
726.0,Provider,"yeah so just. So just a lovely I want you to internally, if you feel safe to do this, just think yourself in your body in your mind for being there, right now, at this moment right now. Thinking yourself because you're you're still healing all these different little parts of yourself. And we want those parts to feel safe here with you because you know that you have the best interest for yourself and that's good okay. All right."
5797.0,Patient,Where were you saying.
726.0,Provider,"How do you feel at this moment, now I."
5797.0,Patient,"feel okay. You know I feel I mean i'll just say like happy, but I feel a process like I feel like okay nervous but excited about the process. um yeah."
726.0,Provider,So I actually I want to see if we have something I think we might already have something I.
5797.0,Patient,"Think, we will do. I was actually thinking about have you heard about those weighted."
726.0,Provider,"blankets, yes I have."
5797.0,Patient,I been thinking about getting one.
726.0,Provider,great idea.
5797.0,Patient,Because I think that that might help me with multiple things okay.
726.0,Provider,Absolutely sleep to.
5797.0,Patient,Does it.
726.0,Provider,does help with sleep oh yeah. Oh calm.
5797.0,Patient,Tuesday Is when I have it next.
726.0,Provider,And it's at 230.
5797.0,Patient,Yes.
726.0,Provider,"Perfect so Porsche I think the wind blankets, an awesome awesome tool cuz it's like we talked about it's tactile you can feel it and. I you it's it's really good for sleep, so if you're anxious and you have a hard time falling asleep um it can be very, very helpful."
5797.0,Patient,"Okay, I was thinking about getting like a throw one and put it around me for when i'm having a hard time settling down. So I could just have it on me as to."
726.0,Provider,"Even have shoulder wants to. Oh, specifically for your shoulders if that's something that might be helpful for you um The other thing I was going to say is during during this week until I see you next week, I want you to think of something that feels good in your heart that. That lovely at maybe 12 five six would have wanted do something kind and loving for that child that you were Okay, because if you're acknowledging her you are giving her the space and the time. Where you're trying to. heal things parts of yourself, so do something for yourself, that is, for that lovely as a kid and. Okay, it could be really simple like I there's people that really like the smell of kranz, for example, because it reminds them of being in school and being with their friends or something, it can be anything but. it's kind of like a gesture of love to that and giving giving that love and compassion to that child that that went through all those things do something for yourself. at a young age, it does it i'm not saying like go to the I mean you can go to the playground, if you wanted to."
5797.0,Patient,But Alex swings. I love to swing it's like a meditation for me.
726.0,Provider,yeah so.
5797.0,Patient,Maybe I. tried to go and venture out and find somewhere I couldn't swing.
726.0,Provider,You could.
5797.0,Patient,"Okay i'm kind of excited about that, like. trying to figure out where to. go around here that I could get on a swing."
726.0,Provider,"or even like it could even be simple things like watching a favorite movie that you've watched when you were kids that you haven't seen in a really long time. And I also feeding that part of yourself when you're like damn like I remember. Really loving that movie and feeling so good and or anything that helps that kid feel good and safe um whatever it is, you can be super creative with it, you know think outside the box, whatever it is."
5797.0,Patient,"Okay yeah kind of like that yeah. yeah well. Like maybe make some cookies that I used to really love or something. yeah. Okay. Alright sounds good. Okay. All right, you next week."
726.0,Provider,I will. lumpy Porsche big Daniel.
