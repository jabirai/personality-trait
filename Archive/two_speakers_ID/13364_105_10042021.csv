ID,Role,Message
105.0,Provider,Oh. Excellent.
13364.0,Patient,"Sorry, took a couple minutes, I was waiting in line so."
105.0,Provider,"Sometimes there's a few people ahead of you and checking in a little early, let me, let me see if you already know about the SMS check in do you want me to teach you how to do that."
13364.0,Patient,yeah that'd be great.
105.0,Provider,"get your recovery journal because i'm going to give you the phone number to do it. So this is what you do, my understanding is You can check in as early as 24 hours in advance the upside is as easy the downside is, you may forget about your appointment during that. 24 hours. But I just want to let you know you have that option so here it is so what you do is you text 415458. To 688 and you just write individual therapy with Glenn 12pm on October 4 so they need to know when. So, like the date the time the person and the what like what you're doing meeting, for you know individual therapy, please check me in something like that, and then there are designated people that just look at SMS messages. And I will tell you it has ranged from 20 minutes later they got a confirmation to a day later, so I have nothing to tell you, except go for it. But if you wait to the last minute 10 minutes before now you're missing out on the chance to go in a virtual clinic and get in line, so I would do it much earlier to test it out. that'd be my experiment and if it doesn't work, then you go to verse half hour before the appointment something like that."
13364.0,Patient,Word shopping.
105.0,Provider,"yeah read it back to me I just you know, make sure you heard it correctly."
13364.0,Patient,"It is some 24 hour, you can check in up to 24 hours in advance with a text to know or 154 or five eight to 688 anytime the reason. The date the time."

13364.0,Patient,"um let's just wait, did you want me to wait or sorry."
105.0,Provider,"it's okay i'll just have my eyes down a little bit, but i'll definitely I can hear."
13364.0,Patient,"um no just getting, along with others, it seems like um no I just have been getting an argument along you know, like what's my boyfriend and. You know just lashing out and like one minute, you know it's just my moves, you know that they affect me bad you know when when i'm happy in the next minute i'm sad or just my emotions are just it's just like PMs thing every day all day horrible."
105.0,Provider,Is it felt like this your whole life feeling like you're on this emotional roller.
13364.0,Patient,"When i'm on the edge all the time, so let you know just emotional roller coaster yeah."
105.0,Provider,"All right. And the times that you have been able to let's say you have an impulse to say something the times that you have caught yourself. holding back that initial impulse, can you think of a time when that was."
13364.0,Patient,"move no it's been a while um or I realized, you know, like it was it wasn't right or what I said, you know until after it's happened, you know what the guilt. kicks out yeah just like a savage."
105.0,Provider,Let me now I am completely on i'm with you but i'm investigating right now i'm looking for a time so i'm going to push on that response just a little bit and i'm going to say this. Are you sure that you haven't been frustrated irritated or angry even coming into group here at bright heart health or even coming in to see me and you didn't lash out didn't. say anything angry.
13364.0,Patient,um yeah.
105.0,Provider,"yeah see we did find one yeah yeah if we look hard enough, I know we find them. So you can do it. You can and it's us really yeah but it's the same skills it's the same skills. Rather."
13364.0,Patient,than adrenaline like like tessa. do women have testosterone.
105.0,Provider,"Like lower level, we have it. We have it yeah."
13364.0,Patient,"I have never been tested, I wonder if I have more it's like i'm just you know just very. Like Hawk whoa."
105.0,Provider,"let's keep investigating let's keep investigating, because we can be going into, and I can get fancy all ways of talking, you know in in not being. talkative in our vacation, but if we can't get that inhibition of impulse managed first where there's there's this sort of sense of I have choice right now. Oh, I have choice, and now I kind of going to think about whether it's worth it, that I speak that's secondary we've got to get that that initial stuff done so we're."
13364.0,Patient,"Working on right i'm going to cut you off, but I was looking to Marina watching these videos on YouTube about the personality disorders and. Oh man yeah that's very interesting, I really definitely have the borderline one the borderline personality disorder and a couple other."
105.0,Provider,"What features so yeah. You actually the first time first. first time you met with me, you said that to me so."
13364.0,Patient,"i'm sorry, what did you say."
105.0,Provider,There are oh yeah it looks like my Internet connection is unstable i'm getting a notice so.
13364.0,Patient,i'm going to worry.
105.0,Provider,"About that so when you watch the video there are what's called Cardinal features they're the big ones that. distinguish borderline from, for example, bipolar disorder just that or narcissistic personality disorder Wednesday, so when you looked at borderline What was it that you said that's me."
13364.0,Patient,"i'm it was you know I don't think I should have wrote them down. But like I really don't remember, but they they're pretty much all of them are the key features, you know, like you were saying. wow author write them down next time and then maybe. We can."
105.0,Provider,"Say Okay, I can bring some up. Typically there's one very important one, which is the rapid cycling with bipolar we might see days go by, where you're one thing. let's say well yeah your skills throughout the day."
13364.0,Patient,yep they were.
105.0,Provider,And is it oftentimes in response to communicating or not communicating with someone else do you notice it's in relationship with.
13364.0,Patient,"Someone nation is. horrible it's it's like I never was taught right, you know how to communicate with people with my children with anybody really you know it's um I think that is a big key part of. The issue to look I don't know how to express it i'm just like wow you know it's not lack or they think i'm yelling at them when i'm not or you know, a mad when i'm not even my Texas, you know it's like no i'm just you know I don't know."
105.0,Provider,"The roller coaster of the mode, would you say oftentimes it's in relationship with someone I just listened to that question, in other words if you're by yourself you're moving around the home by yourself, is the ups and downs of mood as often."
13364.0,Patient,"um no, but a lot of things trigger like."
105.0,Provider,"You know yeah. Because, then you think about someone. What they did, or what they didn't do. Okay, so those those would be true, and then there is the, this is the part I haven't been able to see in you, I can't quite see it yet. Have you noticed it would happen in therapy also was there, maybe a therapist or a friend or boyfriend or someone that they started to seem like they would eventually reject you and you made sure heck no i'm out I can't stand that and you left first."
13364.0,Patient,"yeah just like our when me and my. Ex have split up only moved out here. it's like revenge, I was always revenge revenge revenge revenge it's like let it go accepted he moved on, he has kids now he you know his righteous anger this resentment. Usually, people will get over you know, like over time, but it was like I just revenge I just kept wanting to you know, make it work for him worse worse me feel better it was weird I don't know um. But yeah wasn't done, but I don't know if you mean something like that, with abandonment."
105.0,Provider,"Going more towards abandonment i've got through that. But. Let me give you something that might happen here in therapy so, for example. That you were going to use the word sensitive I see it as a positive thing so that's how i'm going to use it. There might be a hyper. reactivity that's the problem area it's not quite adaptive because we've left before we actually checked out our first awareness and sensitivity so let's say in here let's say I say something that challenges. Your self perception we don't know where that's going to show up, we never do i'm pretty careful, but I promise I will offend you somehow some way is careful as I am it's going to happen, I may. Not even be saying anything, and I might be offending. So that's an assumption that I make, but my question is whether you've been with people and. You were like they're dangerous they're going to reject me and. I need to go, I reject them I am mad at them, I don't want anything to do with them, because they may not like me something it'll be somewhere in that. range, where it was you didn't give it a few chances to really find out if your initial assumption was correct you just left the relationship before you gave it a chance."
13364.0,Patient,"No, I mean so much more issue is of there being like I just hate being alone like i'll sit there and i'll settle for somebody that treats me. Well, rather than be by myself, but I just i'm definitely afraid of to be alone, you know in my house even you know. And it's like i'll keep this as hold on I said, you know just so i'm not by myself, you know and and it makes everything worse, you know and then i'm like Why am I doing this to myself. You know and and then I always feel like everybody's against me like you know, like turn even jobs, you know i'll quit jobs, because I think you know. That like in the beginning they're fine everything's going good and, obviously, when I feel like everybody's turned on me, everything is me my fault they're watching me i'm bad i'm not good at my job, no more i'm not interested in that i'll just quit."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, we might have just found one, so one of the so on one hand i'm doing two things at the same time, one i'm gonna i'm talking about these features, but also, I hope, you've picked up over time. i'm not a huge user of a label for me it's all about you have come to be this way because it has been adaptive in some way it has served us so not too hung up on these labels. But I will say this thing you just described at work could be another piece of what here you're describing as this is borderline thing which is we tend to and my show up here to. idealize people we might Oh, this is so wonderful they're so wonderful so great oh there's the best and then they are the villain. And there's a huge drop and then we're like. they're dangerous I got to get out. And there's no there's no coming back and knowing the self is resilient that. You get to show up anyway, even though they made a mistake, or they were rude or they were insensitive in some way there's not this massive drop way up from idealization all this way drop down but you're nodding, so that does sound familiar."
13364.0,Patient,You have. Your room with one yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so that often happens in here i'm like oh she's so wonderful and then I make a mistake or I offend and i'm or I don't respond in a text or something and I am now an unloving character i'm now a villain i'm a scary unavailable you see it. Young and happen here and i'm prepared for it. But I can only work this through if we still have new showing up if you completely leave I can't talk about it."
13364.0,Patient,"No closure right exactly. Well, not closure, but you know."
105.0,Provider,"So they're thinking. Well, that right, even though that that may show up for you or I hate when she's an idiot she's dangerous she doesn't like me if that ever happens. show up anyway show up anyway and tell me that, even if you have to yell it that's fine because we'll be able to work, I know I rowdy it in, but I want, I want to give you full permission, because if it turns out, this is the label that we're working with. I would rather you show up anyway, because this is a unique relationship i'm not your boss. mm hmm you get to work through that initial response on initial impression, and we get to have it be a therapeutic experience that doesn't happen anywhere else. Not our sisters, not our kids not our boyfriends not our parents. That can happen here and it takes a lot of courage and you loving yourself just enough to know something unique may happen that just never happened before, and show up for it. Okay. yeah okay."
13364.0,Patient,"hold on one, second, let me get I need to have. A daughter like like okay hold on one second i'm sorry okay. Sorry okay i'm good i'm back sorry. Okay."
105.0,Provider,"we've we're into this 20 minutes, done a little bit of psycho education, would you like to have an actual therapeutic. activity with me today, this would be different, it would be us it wouldn't be note taking you would be just experiencing, it would you be open to that."
13364.0,Patient,From your phone.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's do some preparation, for example, your daughter is everyone Okay, so that you could stay here, it does take a lot of concentration."
13364.0,Patient,um yeah.
105.0,Provider,yeah okay.
13364.0,Patient,we're good with concentrating it's like focusing. Oh partnering with that.
105.0,Provider,"All right, so it's just find yourself a comfortable this particular process i'm going to start. doing the internal family systems work with you and working with your parts Okay, and remember. All parts are welcome welcome in this model, which means even and I may have talked to you about it even suicidal ideation cutting drug use. sexually acting out depression rage in this particular model, all of the things that we have done or that pop into our head are there because they're trying to solve a problem. they're trying to probably push down some other emotions, so it doesn't completely overwhelm you yeah okay so there's no shame coming from me Okay, so if it pops up and you tell me and that's another part trying to communicate with you. So in this one very basic is, we have a core self and that core self sometimes we don't get to feel it very often we're feeling so dis regulated, but our core self is when we are feeling confident curious calm content. And it might be fleeting it might come and go, and then some some we get hijacked by another part. But you're going to say Okay, are you feeling curious and compassionate right now and Okay, you might be speaking from your core self the capital S right didn't have a I haven't thought of a fancy name for it so it's basically the authentic self the adults capital SL for now. So I want to start to get your protect get to know your protective parts your manager parts, but in order to do it, I want to dip in just for a second into some of your history. Of when you were younger probably a memory that may have begun with possibly a really embarrassing or humiliating event um do you have a memory like that, where you felt embarrassed or humiliated."
13364.0,Patient,My dad just the whole relationship between my mom and dad it was just for me growing up really affected us bad they both which is great each other very bad i'm. Meeting. I mean my dad would just 2 million me all the time when I was growing up.
105.0,Provider,"You know it's there and what's the earliest age, you can picture that younger self just picturing her much, much, much, much smaller and younger, what is the youngest age that you can recall, we won't stay with this memory very long."
13364.0,Patient,i'm probably when I was. I would say. eight nine.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. And now to move over to the protective manager Parts I want you to really picture that little girl, and you can maybe see maybe it's your father who's saying something or doing something in the experience for you as humiliating. Something developed in you at that age, in order for you to survive that and never feel that intensity of humiliation, what did you have to do it might be a new thought it might be a behavior so that you would be overwhelmed by that humiliation teach you have to do."
13364.0,Patient,"From. It was, it was a lot of it was to my weight to like you know i'm with my dad, no, no, you would be prettier if you were skinnier you know stuff like that and. I don't know why, would you even you know, look at me that type of you know i'm your daughter."
105.0,Provider,"Regardless stay with this say with this exercise, you did great. Really really picture picture this little girl, can you do that in your mind. And just imagine that she is a self repairing little critter okay there's a part of even her at that very young age, new Oh, if this humiliation keeps coming I won't survive this i'm going to have to do something. To protect this heart the soul this self, what do you think she developed, it might be a way of being speaking doing something she did something that grew and developed. Right about them so that she wouldn't feel the intensity of that humiliation and let me kind of judge that what's, the first thing that comes to mind."
13364.0,Patient,um honestly I don't think i've. emulating is when you make fun of somebody right.
105.0,Provider,"or like you make them feel like yes yeah you, you did it was it's also."
13364.0,Patient,"It is. The self esteem type is that what you mean, as far as using Emily my school, I have no self esteem. um."
105.0,Provider,"Let me see if we've got it you want to check in you are checking in on definition to stay there, and looking at her. And my and might even be useful to cross compare to age six and five, and this behavior this Defense mechanism this coping mechanism goes by a lot of different names in this model it's. it's a protective part it's a manager, but it wasn't there it five and six, but then at age eight oh boy in order to not feel that horrible feeling affiliation protective part showed up what do you think showed up to try to protect you."
13364.0,Patient,"um honestly I don't think it's really showed up too much, I mean i've always had that hurt filling in me of hurt and sadness okay."
105.0,Provider,So let me see i'm going to check on something I want to know is that right about when you started to feel shame.
13364.0,Patient,"i'm shame, as far as can you explain."
105.0,Provider,like that. I am bad.
13364.0,Patient,"um no that didn't start really starts over you know, maybe middle school high school middle at the end, when I was getting a little bit older. yeah and when I was younger there really wasn't I was just confused I think i'm you know, like why Why am I not perfect, what can I do this right, everything has to be perfect."
105.0,Provider,I say there. So age eight did you just say that you needed to be perfect.
13364.0,Patient,yeah everything has to be perfect.
105.0,Provider,"Stay so we just found one so now, I want you to look at this little girl and see with compassion that what she did to survive, that was become perfectionist stick, well then i'll just be perfect, do you see that she started to develop that right around age eight. Okay, we found one nicely done let's turn our attention to that part and we're going to spend the rest of today with that one okay. Now you're going to hear words in this model you'll get used to it probably after first or second session and it's kind of quirky this one is kind of kind of funky. But other things don't really help us heal they help us understand why are we miserable with ourselves, but they don't help us heal and I want I want you to have that Okay, but if you can laugh Okay, because some of this stuff seems a little funky at first so. What I want you to do if you can and you might want to close your eyes or even do a drawing I mean i'm going to find out how easy it is for you to unplanned, but I want you to picture the perfectionist. When should a picture, this is a separate part of you. You can get an image of it is that he or she a blob look like you and when this image comes up just describe it to me, so I can help us come back to it if we ever need to."
13364.0,Patient,"Really it's just there, I really feel image, you know of. know what i'm trying to put."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let me help me help a little bit. Let me see if you can see, the little girl for you earlier, able to see the little eight year old the younger self."
13364.0,Patient,"No it's pretty much it's like a blackout, when I was younger, you know as far as. or."
105.0,Provider,"In general yeah in your mind. For example, when I had asked you to pull up a memory, can you picture, maybe from a memory that what this younger part looked like yeah. You can picture her. So we'll start with that so all instruct about how to blend so you are not her. So when you can see her from a distance, perhaps seeing her in another room Maybe you can see her a few feet away from you, even here that's what we're doing is unblinding, it is not you it is. A memory it's not you, but that memory also has things attached to it like emotions and we talked about a couple of them like humiliation embarrassment, they are also. Not you they're apart and separate from you know that's what I want you to see a seam her she's the one that has that sad she's the one that feels humiliated, can you see that. Okay, but also feel that it's a memory, it is not right now, and it is not you. Now good so there's this ability to have that distance that's what I need when I say to blend from a part you just did it with this younger self I want to be able to do, and also with the perfectionist stick part so we're going to try it with that one okay you're doing great. It is very common for people to be so well blended with their manager parts like being perfect that they cannot imagine being away from it, it would be terrifying right. And I get that I run into it all day long Okay, so no surprises here. it's an awfully important part of you. And so we're going to be very respectful. You know as much as you can, and this is where the goofiness comes in and no you won't go crazy from right it's just a thought, but I want you to ask this part of you this perfectionist part which is there to protect you from the overwhelming feeling of humiliation that's where it started. I want you to ask it. Now change, I want you to share with this perfectionist part your gratitude to it to share your gratitude. out loud and it may seem silly, but it would look like this. Thank you for giving me hope use your own words i'm making something up, thank you for giving me hope that if I just work hard enough that i'll i'll make it through this fucked up situation. And and and you've actually gotten me a lot of things that maybe if you hadn't shown up I wouldn't Thank you. So I want you to do something like that, but your story not nothing I made up right."
13364.0,Patient,"let's see. i'm trying to think. Thank you for. Giving are getting me a lot of compliments on you know things that i've done and put together in my life. Because i'm. Such a perfectionist i'm just kidding no but thank you, I appreciate it and it's gonna be compliments, I would say."
105.0,Provider,"As far as so okay this go Nice and slow, if you can see the face, see the reaction of that gratitude. Yes, there we go yeah and what does that expression look like."
13364.0,Patient,i'm smiling happy look good.
105.0,Provider,"So let's see now if it's willing to step back, so that we can. get to know it even better we're not going to abandon it and leave it rather just having this space this foot space. A little bit of space it's actually to try and understand it more have a have more of a relationship to it so as much as you can is very visual try and picture. You saw the smiling face just see asking, are you willing to step back even a couple feet, so I can get to know you a little better."
13364.0,Patient,"So, as you said."
105.0,Provider,"Yes, asking, are you willing to step back a little bit so that I can get to know you a little bit better."
13364.0,Patient,"Are you willing to step back a little bit, so I can get to know you better."
105.0,Provider,And notice what comes up. For informed don't don't try and please me I just got to know what's going on.
13364.0,Patient,we'll see i'm just another smile.
105.0,Provider,"Another smile does it seem like it's got some distance from you like, can you get an initial okay beautiful so stay there, and continue to look at it and describe what you see, aside from the smiling face What else do you see as an image."
13364.0,Patient,i'm. A warm feeling. i'm. Welcoming like yeah. agreeing to do.
105.0,Provider,So is it safe to say that your relationship with perfectionism is that you have a warm relationship with it.
13364.0,Patient,i'm. yeah now now that I see you know it's getting there.
105.0,Provider,"it's getting there Okay, and is the welcoming coming from you or from the perfectionist."
13364.0,Patient,i'm both.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, welcoming both ways all right. Do you have mixed feelings we often do, although you shared your gratitude, sometimes we have negative feelings towards it, would you be willing to share those with that part."
13364.0,Patient,yeah I would say negative because a lot of times i'm just it drives me crazy sometimes.
105.0,Provider,You you say you look at it and you say you drive me crazy and watch us reaction it's a little different this technique right you drive me crazy.
13364.0,Patient,will drive me crazy.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and watch the reaction smiling before what is it doing now."
13364.0,Patient,looks sad confused.
105.0,Provider,"Okay looks sad and confused. Can you ask it, what are you confused about and wait for the answer and try and do it ahead of time."
13364.0,Patient,What are you confused about.
105.0,Provider,and watch this expression.
13364.0,Patient,Really can't tell. What.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so we stay there, we don't make anything that's not happening happen, we just are with it. kaylee what is it for you to be with this part. That doesn't know itself doesn't it's confused right, but maybe it's not why don't you actually asking, are you confused about how you make me drive me crazy let you ask a question."
13364.0,Patient,Or you can feel and how you make me crazy.
105.0,Provider,There you go and watch the expression watch the image.
13364.0,Patient,"No, it was just like I was just so fully adapted into. You know this feeling. As a child, like it just grew on me pretty much you know just."
105.0,Provider,"So turn towards that part because often there's repeated re blending make sure you, you see it as a separate part of you continue to see it separate and why don't you ask it. How old, do you think I am."
13364.0,Patient,"How old, do you think I am."
105.0,Provider,How old do you see me.
13364.0,Patient,How old you see me.
105.0,Provider,Going wait for the response.
13364.0,Patient,"um I see, I still feel a little young girl."
105.0,Provider,"So notice how you feel and what your thoughts are. With being told you are viewed as a little girl. notice your yeah you just heard that brand new information share with perfectionism your real chronological age, let it know how old you are and give it evidence of how you know that."
13364.0,Patient,I am 35 years old. I take on great responsibility. For the things that are in my life.
105.0,Provider,"And look at the expression of that part, what is its face look like what's the aspect."
13364.0,Patient,"um I would say. Like in shock not shocked, but like yeah shocked like wow."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, there you go so keep looking at that face and just ask it you look shocked What surprises you."
13364.0,Patient,You look sharp What surprises you.
105.0,Provider,Wait wait for the response.
13364.0,Patient,"I got stuck right here, no."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, just stay with it, you do it fantastic. Instead, just describe what you notice it's a visual, what do you see happening, I saw you look shocked What surprises you and then, what do you see in the image."
13364.0,Patient,"um. I don't know I can't get this one, no, no."
105.0,Provider,"Well, it might be that we have. Another part showing up which might be an analyst. They often do, and they they sort of almost have a power struggle with me. If that's what's happening trying to answer for it or analyze you would want that part to also step. One that's trying to figure out before you actually do the thing trying to come up with an answer yeah so see if you can ask that part two. it's really good at analyzing a note, you know it looks at YouTube videos it's got these fancy words from psychology it's got some nice summaries for things, but you have someone here. So just maybe ask that part just step back a little bit."
13364.0,Patient,huh a little bit let's see. yeah. figure out what is going on. and
105.0,Provider,What happened.
13364.0,Patient,I got thrown off.
105.0,Provider,"Okay it's all right, this is a lot. you're doing great so this takes a bit. It seems like you kind of related to this idea that there might be an this intellectual analyst that does a lot of thinking and labeling."
13364.0,Patient,Oh that's all I do is thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's do that, so this might also be very common. Once you do ask that part hey also could you go hang out in the waiting room, I mean i've got this therapist here she's got some labels, we can she's doing all this work, can you if you want take a little rest for a minute. See if it's willing to step back and and blend from you."
13364.0,Patient,So when I say.
105.0,Provider,Whatever you want whatever feels respectful. To ask it to unwind from you and wait in a waiting room somewhere.
13364.0,Patient,Please i'm blend for me and within the waiting room with me yeah well I am handling my therapy session with my counselor.
105.0,Provider,yeah there you go and notice what happens then just tell me.
13364.0,Patient,i'm. kind of a relief yeah like.
105.0,Provider,who's relieved. yeah already analyst.
13364.0,Patient,me yeah.
105.0,Provider,Good. So we're going to get.
13364.0,Patient,Your visual kind of yeah.
105.0,Provider,"kind of see it, is it a male female what does it look like so."
13364.0,Patient,If you know.
105.0,Provider,what's it look like.
13364.0,Patient,she's got a little girl yeah again with a medium brown here and. Then her baby don't.
105.0,Provider,see your analyst is a child. How do you feel toward it.
13364.0,Patient,i'm. I feel. guilt kind of I don't know.
105.0,Provider,"How does this analyst little girl with medium sort of brown hair, how does she feel towards you."
13364.0,Patient,and She looked friendly but said.
105.0,Provider,she feels friendly and sad let's see if she has an opinion of you.
13364.0,Patient,Do you have an opinion of me. And no. not really.
105.0,Provider,"Can you ask it. What do you do for me in this family system right because that's what all these different parts are asked that analysts, what do you do for us."
13364.0,Patient,What do you do for us.
105.0,Provider,Wait to really try to picture she's a little girl medium brown hair.
13364.0,Patient,Look at for us.
105.0,Provider,Watch and listen we've got to be patient.
13364.0,Patient,there's just a smile really.
105.0,Provider,"smile. You may have an idea. or this much younger part the one we were looking at very much earlier. may have a sense of what the analysts does to protect little little girl this one from humiliation, what does analysts do for the system doesn't do."
13364.0,Patient,"She put up a guard pretty much against the wall, a wall, but you know, like a protection around me I guess from. kind of you know um. But not too much because it's still you know purchasing you just get lash out."
105.0,Provider,"There you go so stay with that My guess is, these are blended so let's pull those part also we're going to go with lash out. Okay. And would it be safe to say that it has features of anger that lash out has feelings of anger. mm hmm Okay, but pure analyst does a pure thinking part lash out. it's just separate from anger, does it lash out."
13364.0,Patient,i'm when i'm thinking about thing is that we mean was there.
105.0,Provider,"yeah well right these oftentimes we all have our parts are merged together, but if we were just to separate them here today and say that analysts all by itself, it was just thinking and labeling would it be possible to unblock end from anger."
13364.0,Patient,And you. Know really it's kind of. A negative negative.
105.0,Provider,"There you go okay so. stay there with that and, although I thought my focus was somewhere else. right here taking this model, I want you to notice how you feel with the fact that the analytical part of you, the one that thinks is so blended with anger that it doesn't get a chance to chest. Think tell a story and label things it has this connection to anger that's almost won't let go. You see that. What is your opinion about part. and see if you can share it with that part that'll be the last thing as far as this exercise go see if you can share it, how you feel with the fact that it's still so tightly blended."
13364.0,Patient,um. You don't really know.
105.0,Provider,"How do you feel in your body toward analyst being blended with anger. Sometimes it's somatic, we can feel it in our bodies like something might constrict something might happen in our throat eyes stomach muscles see if you can."
13364.0,Patient,my stomach starts to get sick like worries okay.
105.0,Provider,You know.
13364.0,Patient,Various it I don't know I just me on my stomach sick like worried like where you going.
105.0,Provider,"Now that one how old is that part done, one that worries and it has a set of six stomach. Please Okay, even as early as six. So what I want you to do is. we're gonna to the degree that you want these parts to come back just kind of let them integrate back with they're all there to take care of you to message in some way something to you that's. So that you don't fall apart okay. And are not overwhelmed by those early feelings of humiliation and shame and worry those protective parts like analyst anger perfectionism lashing out or showed up in your life to protect you. So we're normally we say Oh, we don't like anger anger is bad, a lot of people do that not here, not in this work okay. This is very different than what most people are doing. Good. And we're going to take some time right here at the end before the session ends, because it goes by pretty quickly. Just share what you noticed from this process."
13364.0,Patient,i'm just like a sense of relief.
105.0,Provider,Relief yeah.
13364.0,Patient,"A little bit of calm, I feel calmer. Young right."
105.0,Provider,"Would it be okay if we came at this again there's a lot, a lot of work to do that, I can see anyway, and one of the first things i'm noticing is. You were talking earlier when we when we arrived together about anger. and In doing this, parts work what I see is that thinking. is tightly blended with anger and you're not able to sort of get those apart. I want to work on that next time or sometime. Because wouldn't it be nice to be able to think without getting angry. yeah right. have access to our superstar. yeah."
13364.0,Patient,cuz this part up here.
105.0,Provider,We want to kind of.
13364.0,Patient,The. Anger finger that's what I do.
105.0,Provider,"So, but never see the good. yeah so remember that so it's a very, very negative i'll use that word negative part of you it's a very negative okay i'm gonna want to pick that up again um let's schedule another appointment. We can do this same thing."
