235.0,Provider,"Well, you just have to be. You know, cautious, the best you can I mean you can't you can't put yourself in bubble wrap you know what I mean. But at the same time you got to be wise about it but anyhow I what I wanted to do today is to kind of my my people who my clinical supervisor wants me to to start doing smart goals, which is short term and long term goals."
15332.0,Patient,"What do you tell me to work on that last. On our last meeting remember you said ain't one day ours, can you write down some and with everything that's going on, I am sorry, my homework did not get done."
235.0,Provider,"All right, well that's okay. But what Okay, what do you think. Do you have something that's clear and emphasize what you'd want to happen, like a specific goal Let me read off some things that maybe we could think about Okay, she would see what you might be interested okay. Okay, maybe this will be helpful, because I know it takes a little bit to jot down memory and. All that good stuff so i'll give you some topics and we could just kind of go from there and. You can read them off. Anger management anxiety. attention deficit disorder. Chemical dependency can chemical dependency relapse chronic pain.

Action words specific clear and emphasize what you want to happen and we want to want. To. You want to have tools to relieve your anxiety. Does that sound okay. wow Okay, and this your time have tools to relieve anxiety. And then we'll go over a few. yeah I think i've done like five of these so far and three of them that anxiety. I mean if i've been right mind i'll probably do anxiety to."
15332.0,Patient,be able to go out of the House without having to force myself days before.
235.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I know one Gal she's yet like I tell I think I told you she's fine if it's like spur of the moment okay let's go, but if it's some you have to think about like oh man, this is going to be a social event that. You know and. The paranoia starts kicking in."
15332.0,Patient,"My kicks in with the spare the moment, too, but sometimes I can do it."
235.0,Provider,"yeah well you really good thanksgiving. yeah but they came over to your place, though. When you had it you had a good time, if I remember correctly okay measurable goal, where you can measure your progress okay so let's take a look at. What anxiety says here and then we'll we'll take a look at measuring progress. Well okay. And then we could we could discuss this when we get together in a couple weeks we can it make it like a two week or a month goal let's see that borderline that one. Some require okay. anxiety should be this one here. See. How to use treatment introduction i'm sorry. feast anger management care we're getting close. Just about therapy tension antisocial behavior. that's a tough one, you know anybody that deals with that. me know you're far from."
15332.0,Patient,antisocial What do you mean what does that mean.
235.0,Provider,it's people that can't get along in society that are always cranky type. You know they're they're agitated they lash out that they're not pleasant to be around.
15332.0,Patient,I just don't want to be around people I get scared.
235.0,Provider,"Well, they get their negative move at mood and a lot of them are act on it, you know there'll be there'll be violent and stuff like that, I mean there's different gradations of it but."
15332.0,Patient,that's not me no it definitely is a you.
235.0,Provider,"Okay short term objectives, let me, let me. Take that off. put on senior glasses. extras to. verbalize and understand a cognitive philosophical and behavioral components of anxiety. I think we'll pass on that one unless you want to learn and implement calming skills to reduce overall anxiety and manage anxiety symptoms, when you think of that."
15332.0,Patient,That sounds good.
235.0,Provider,"Okay, so measurable is is. Implement. calming skills. calming skills. and review. and sequence review in. Time measure time. and smart in a. Okay, the a is for achievable. Now the specific goal. Is. What do you think of learning relaxation skills like. Measuring. And this is like insight timer. Okay, you know that you're familiar with it. Now we could go to some Apps and you could do that, like like two times a day, can you do that, can you make. For that one okay insight timer. Side timer twice a day. To day. Using APP. applicable. To anxiety. Which are like sleep APP which are like muscle relaxation. Guided imagery. Maybe make a little note, make a notebook of what what you do okay. don't do to one day do one whatever you know what i'm saying some or five minutes so there's a 1015 I know you're busy."
15332.0,Patient,i've seen I seen some of them wonder just like two minutes.
235.0,Provider,"yeah exactly so just the main thing is to get in the habit and just to start that. let's see the a stands for achievable goal needs to be attainable. You don't want something crazy like exercise you, you know you're jogging around the House and then you're going to run a marathon is this is this achievable you think."
15332.0,Patient,know. What we did yeah I mean but not better yes.
235.0,Provider,"This plan is achievable. Yes, okay this plan. is achievable. Please. And then the next thing would be we're almost there the are which is realistic it's not to be easy, but feel capable and achieving the goal, so I think it's a matter of discipline kind of like you know twice a day, maybe once in the morning, once in the afternoon or evening. Is it is that realistic to you."
15332.0,Patient,yeah.
235.0,Provider,"very realistic. realistic. and Will. Make notes let's put like make like make notes. In journal case it gets something to journal just write down your, we want a couple words or whatever what you did."
15332.0,Patient,When you think about I was doing before and then.
235.0,Provider,"yeah. kind of the measurement and then the timeframe set a time frame for the goal next week, one month three months, six months. While you we want to do it in one month."
15332.0,Patient,Long oh sounds good see.
235.0,Provider,How we'll do we'll measured in one month one. I think that's pretty reasonable right there and then we'll see you know if it's gone down a little bit if you can measure it and stuff I think it's real achievable subset setting timeframe. timeframe. out. One month and review.
15332.0,Patient,Local.
235.0,Provider,"and review okay cool we've got that setup and I probably should put your name down so we know who we're talking like. I probably could put in just about everybody, you know.

15332.0,Patient,"You know she said that i'm just doing the quarantine with the kids away for a few days, so I could see if I test positive. yeah to be able to come back."
235.0,Provider,"I like that idea yeah just to just double check and make sure, but if any anybody that can handle it the best Paul I think it's the kids. Their immune systems are. are strong, you know that they're."
15332.0,Patient,In the past month to my grandkids have been in and out of the hospital already. All three of her kids have bad breathing problems.
235.0,Provider,"What does it look like a lot of people, I think it must be the cold weather or something over there, I don't know."

235.0,Provider,"Have you tested positive on anything yet are you okay. Good good good well that's good just keep your your daughter, and the kids in prayer and. Anything on your mind you want to talk about so anything any concerns you have or."
15332.0,Patient,"No i'm just dealing with the thing with my mom her having that they'll palsy and it was also a stroke, at the same time, so. With my family me not wanting to really go around the whole family because of certain people is she staying with my sister, which means my family's over there, a lot, so that they asked me to come up there and hang out for a little bit with mom I kind of pull away."

I sat with my mom she was actually able, with help to go to the bathroom which is not far at all the bathroom from where she's sleeping right now. And she actually was able to walk to the bathroom but the second time if I wouldn't have grabbed her like how you'd grab a baby up she would have hit the floor, she thought she had it, but she didn't."
235.0,Provider,yeah maybe need to give grab bars or something like that.
15332.0,Patient,"So he's got all that up there, she was trying to push herself and I was standing. You know, real close to her let her try to push yourself, because you read up on bell palsy it says the try to you know push yourself, so your muscles don't just give out yeah and she was trying, she was trying to show me what she had done an hour before I came. And she just couldn't do it."
