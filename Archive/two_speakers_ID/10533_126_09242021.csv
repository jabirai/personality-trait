10533.0,Patient,"yeah so definitely so my friend humid from California here was struggling with childcare and her her partner got incarcerated back in La. So I needed to we set up this really awesome arrangement, where she will I will take her child to school and pick him up three days a week, which i'm able to do because I make my own hours, so I could just mess with it. And then, once my baby is born on those evenings she's gonna watch my baby, the whole night so well up until like 9pm so i'll be able to work like evenings. Three days a week, and I think that's going to work and it's going to be free and that way somebody I trust is with my baby and so it's a huge blessing, it was a difficult transition just to fulfill my work obligations and. fulfill the additional childcare obligations. You know it's just it's part of my whole balance with pain and. Energy, which is you know just the name of the game so yeah."
126.0,Provider,Oh that's amazing.
10533.0,Patient,that's great.
126.0,Provider,"Because that's probably one of the biggest hurdles is that childcare and then you know if you don't have somebody doing it for you, like a relative or friend it's almost like. you're living to pay the babysitter it's like. This is insane I barely. Make enough money babysitter. yeah you know i'm paying somebody to be with my kid and. Oh, my gosh it's it's it's a hard choice."
10533.0,Patient,"it's a really hard day well right. So last since I don't have family and since my partner doesn't have family. You know, to just be able to work my work and continue to get paid as I get paid, which is just i'm so blessed in so many ways."
126.0,Provider,yeah you have more evening appointments and day appointments and. Normally.
10533.0,Patient,I can make that happen yeah.
126.0,Provider,Okay okay. yeah well that's fantastic.

10533.0,Patient,Interesting very interesting.
126.0,Provider,"yeah I can you know the monthly payments on a mobile home are like half of what it would be you know, in an apartment or and then everybody there's so many scammers. yeah apartment or duplex that I looked at on. God that's awesome. yeah em total scam."
10533.0,Patient,"yeah no take your money, so you got to watch."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God, I even had the same couple. Try to scam me twice, three months apart. So my thing was first of all, the scammers are all about. I want you to have my place, I trust you. yeah I live in another state, so I can send you the keys as soon as you send a deposit. can't see the inside of the place."
10533.0,Patient,Right.
126.0,Provider,"I went through this conversation many times with many people. And their whole thing is about. Will you trust me well. I don't know you. It as long as you keep arguing with them or ask no keep going back and forth back and forth back and forth until you have to block their number because. it's ridiculous and there's so half of the ads are scammers like they'll have a picture of a house. And then you'll have a few pictures of the inside of the House in the inside of the House, maybe you can see it's got wood floor but then the description under it says wall to wall carpeting. it's like. This description doesn't even match the House and then."
10533.0,Patient,When I.
126.0,Provider,"Talk about Hillary they're in another state, and they want to trust you with their keys, and so all you have to do is send them the deposit. And my thing was always because i've spoken to this happened at least i'd say probably five or six times and i'd say we're not going to rent a place that I can't see. Through it, and they're like oh no it looks, just like the pictures you don't have to worry we're not going to steal money from you don't worry and they write a whole explanation. I don't know when those pictures were taken again taking 20 years ago. Like no, you know I have done so I would try to turn the tables on him host this one of you trust me. Great me the keys, and if I like it i'll send the deposit oh no we can't do that."
10533.0,Patient,"well. it's funny you know the reason they do, it is because it's successful."
126.0,Provider,"Like. I guess, a lot of people get into that."
10533.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,"How could you how could you if you have not seen the inside of the House, how are you going to trust somebody you don't know."
10533.0,Patient,Oh yeah even people were even doing it here in albuquerque. it's funny.
126.0,Provider,"So this one. It was a different property, but it was, like all the verbiage was the same, and I said this sounds familiar, and I said, you know how can I trust you, if I don't even have your ID. Right oh that was always my comeback, and then, when I saw like way down the road that this lady sent me her ID and I I look at it, and then I look back, like three months that's the same lady. Now. and You guys have tried to scam me before and I never heard back from them yet."
10533.0,Patient,yeah I know it's tough out there it's real tough out there yeah.
126.0,Provider,"You say you know you don't know whether to believe you know who's honest who's not honest, who is really. You know, above board and yeah so."

126.0,Provider,I.
10533.0,Patient,love the one thing I don't yeah your guys's air quality is subpar.
126.0,Provider,"Unfortunately yeah it's gotten worse and worse, I mean with all these fires, because, with all the laws they made when it was so smooth when I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, and it was so So when I was a kid I can barely open my eyes. And then they started making catalytic converters they started making factories, you know smog free and i'd say by like. valley was great the small went away. And then. I was made during the during coven when it when a lot of people stayed home or is it nobody on the freeway. They said that. The air pollution in La. had reached the level of no air pollution, after the coven started it reached the lowest levels of no pollution, since like World War Two. Because nobody on the road, I would get to work in like 20 minutes, where it usually takes me like half hour 45 know. And unfortunately, then we started getting fires. Right and that ruin the whole thing. Now California is just like there's always a fire burning always."
