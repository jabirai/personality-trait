462.0,Provider,"No, there is no perfect relationship, so what kind of things, make you feel most connected to her and like you're keeping things fresh."
9734.0,Patient,"off the wall Just to give you an idea of our relationship, the first night we get she i've never been with the girl that that drives never have I don't like girl to do jobs. to smoke cigarettes take a hit off a joint once in a blue moon, but we were hanging out that first night, and I was. Looking for me or the cultural figured out where I was around the House, I thought I tried taking off out the back door, and I got close well, I was like I didn't even know to three hours at that time was gone she's gone. She bailed. me out of jail."
462.0,Provider,wow okay.
9734.0,Patient,"she's definitely keep her show me bandwidth three guys, including me so Alex you that's not rare you don't find that now. she's she graduated college taken she just one in a million, I will never find another woman, like her, so. I gotta."

462.0,Provider,So she's a big influence in your recovery.
9734.0,Patient,"that's you know what keeps me clean and sober more than anything. yeah we're the thought of having to deal with her and my daughter, when I come back home because I don't you I would never use around my family, I would take off. So I mean I don't want to use I don't have the urge but that right there keeps me in check know what the hell, I will have to deal with if I go out."
462.0,Provider,"And that's really good protective factor I mean. Obviously the hell you'll have to deal with her, but then also the impact that that has on your daughter, and her emotionally it's hurtful you know."
9734.0,Patient,"You would think my daughter's like she treats me not treats me like when I go out and do wrong it's worse with her, because I mean i've. i've been to prison twice i've done all the gap between prison jail very i've i've done over the years and that's out of the 15 I mean her been together, so I got a team and. Then she stopped by my side, every time she never went out on this, you always got my in my boss, I mean she held it down there's not nothing bad to say about we get we have arguments and fights but how."
462.0,Provider,Are you able to do a date night here there I know that's helpful for a lot of people.
9734.0,Patient,"I tell her you know that's one thing that we never do I mean our our daughter was born on the anniversary September 12. birthday September 12 so it's hard to go out for our anniversary. it's hard to you know cuz she weren't so much, and then the money, so I have been saving actually I got a big huge change jar that we save our changes or dolla bills. I want, she wants to go to this is a place in Bangor it's a motel that has like a heart shaped Tom you know. Just me and her."
462.0,Provider,"And we deserve and definitely so. Okay, that could be a good, you know goal right there is just to like you said, save up for a special night for the two of you to get away and it's important to get away not have kids around you know and just have that time for the two of you to connect individually."
9734.0,Patient,"Now I mean she don't she just went on vacation with my daughter, which I didn't go there was my manda her sister. deseret and they were to Florida so i'm pressing forward they stayed down this week, but you know they deserve that but that's not. What they really mean you need to go out and spend time just us."
462.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely I think that's really important and you're acknowledging the importance of that which is really good, you need to. Think about that, like you said you really respect her and care from her From what I hear and so two part of keeping the relationship alive is just having individual time no kids and outside of your House, I need a. Great job cozy home, but sometimes something a little special just feels goes a long way."
9734.0,Patient,"You know she worked her ass off because we rent the House we've been here at this House for almost 11 years button Oh, we want to buy I got she went out when I got out of prison, this time she went on bought my truck my trucks my baby i've never had nothing that Nice. Nice nice Toyota tundra i'd never have that if one for her so what's her car is paid off in my truck straight off of buying a house something that's bars."
462.0,Provider,What do you think is a realistic time frame for that.
9734.0,Patient,"For the next four years, my truck will be paid off in the next three her car will be paid off like a year and a half. But you know lately i've been watching these videos on Facebook. Like little short reels of these people talking like Famous people say you know, the one that stuck in my head was this guy saying, if I was to give you $10 million. But you wouldn't have tomorrow, you know that was it you could spend a $10 million, but you don't have tomorrow you're done and would you do it hell no I wouldn't trade tomorrow for 100 million dollars. So when you know. Well, any not having money or shatter fighting why money if you want to trade money for tomorrow, why you like money ruin today."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's very good thought and. yeah. And a four year time frame is a reasonable one right, so you. can pay off the cars that's very realistic to start with that and. Work your way there."
9734.0,Patient,"And then, when we first got together, I know we're social kitty number and shit and all that stuff and I did I got credit cards in her name and. stuff you know she stuck with me for that we paid those off, but I put her through how."
462.0,Provider,she's very forgiving.
9734.0,Patient,"She. walked in on the cheating on her with her best friend right now. So, at that point time I was trying I couldn't get rid of her, I wanted to break up with her, but now I do want to break up with her, I wanted her to marry me. So guilty about chef Sharon i'm a very firm believer everything happens for a reason and don't worry about my best friend she's my soul mate when people say to me.

This program has you know I like the groups every two weeks, you know I. it's a little Community like you said, our groups good, you know as people we talk, even on after group, you know I can message people and talk to them, I had a friend of mine just got out of prison, the other day. And he messaged me saying brother he's like i'm struggling, I want to go out and you hi i'm like listen man. You don't want to do it because he was at minimum facility so he made he worked for two years, been able to save that money for two years, and my don't go go that money man think of how hard you work for the partners. Like so many people, I was in prison, whether dead now accepting actually seven people i've been out almost two years and I know seven people let's dive and some. me very bad heroin and heroin setting on. me yeah exactly."
462.0,Provider,It really is it's so scary and horrible.
9734.0,Patient,"i've never done i've never done that, so I won't do it come on."
462.0,Provider,very dangerous so that's that's a good thing that you don't want to and you haven't because it's it's definitely taking a lot of lives.
9734.0,Patient,"If I realized i'd want painkillers tells i've never done the hair I tried heroin turn here, and once, when I was on suboxone and i'll tell you what i've never power so damn hard my life."
462.0,Provider,Just horrible.
9734.0,Patient,That.
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's good that's that's a better response than liking it, but it sounds like you're pretty clear on your recovery and you want to do well for yourself and your family and. Your goal right now is to just continue maintaining your recovery going to group."
9734.0,Patient,"Last night I sent my son my son's my I had my son, when I was 14 I was with his mother for like six years, you know my first love. And we we truly hated each other and I sent her a message saying you know tomorrow is not promised. i'd like i'd like to you know, Paul josh everything that you know we might be for the others, like we was French. Like I have like I still remember like it was yesterday, all the Members, we have together, I was like i'd like to start fresh with you for Sean and like i'm not i'm hooked up with you, and she knows my old lady like I just want to get along with you, you know I apologize. I get your chain men's but you know my my dad died travis's brother died so many people I know. You don't know. Know cherish every moment and that's one thing i'm really working. On."
462.0,Provider,"that's a good goal to just to cherish every moment, and to do that by making amends that you need to make right your your co parenting like you said you're not trying to be romantic with her, but this is a mother of your child so to co parent and work together and be able to have. Civil even maybe somewhat friendly communication is. It makes life better it makes every moment better, as you."
9734.0,Patient,"Next i'd like my I have another daughter she's Thank you 16th last time I saw her, she was six months old and her mother, we went to court, the judge said I could see her only one mother said it was okay. For those of the drug so again bad show me her after my dad my sister passed away with cancer and I need your help to my sister she don't know who I am she don't know nothing about my family so."
462.0,Provider,"Okay. So that's something that we can. Put as a goal as well, what would be one step towards working on that."
9734.0,Patient,"problem I say somebody at her mother ah me I can. that's an understatement her mother hates me and. let's know what we ended my son's mother, the one i'm talking about I broke up with her, I still went in love with her and I met up with Shannon. I think I was 1617 shannon's my oldest daughter's mother, and I only used it I did I used it for a car, because she had money and she said she couldn't get well next thing you know she said she's pregnant very. Well, I cheated on her, I mean she would sit in the park and the driveway when I go to a friend's house for seven hours rooms in the House smoking crack. I mean, I would just put her through shit. I would have her bring me over to see JESSICA my son's mother and I don't have sexual JESSICA inside well she's sitting in the parking lot well when she went into Labor to have my daughter I fell head over heels in love with her. And at that time she hated my guts while I was working at a shoe shop I got up at 430 in the morning to go to work on a Friday. And she's given my daughter bath I didn't think nothing of it well, she was supposed to come pick me up she never showed up she left that morning I went to her ex boyfriends house and she'd been with him, ever since she just never talked to her again. Such cool so yeah that's something I don't know where to go, how to go about that."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's something to think about if there's room for an apologetic texts like to your other child's mother or there's not room for that yeah something else. Maybe that is something that you reflect on."
9734.0,Patient,"Right I one thing I could think of is when my daughter turns 18 get Ahold of her myself Dr. But. Like I said, tomorrow is not promised, so what happens. If I can that's what you know in na na they weren't you to make amends, with people i'm not doing it for the drug wise for my not just from a recovery i'm doing it for myself because. I want people to I want people to know that i've changed i'm not that same diet was 1012 years ago people do."
462.0,Provider,"yeah right yeah. So okay so that's a really good more of a mid long term goal to to first reflect on how to approach that. approach, making amends. there. For the matter of like you said cherishing the moment as well as kind of co parenting and having that involvement."
9734.0,Patient,"You know another thing i'm doing I should go when I send them out when I was in rehab had to write a narrative of my life, and I did I wrote everything I did leave nothing out well, I found it updated i'm actually gonna finish. I don't know how old that was 19 i'm not going to be truthful about law."
462.0,Provider,"that's such a great idea to keep it updated I think that's fantastic, so we can put that on the goals to have you updated."
9734.0,Patient,"Knowledge I mentally prepared for that, because there's a lot of shit I gotta put in there."
462.0,Provider,"When you. Do that it should be. In a time when you have the space, the time you can do a little take a walk after something that you know makes you come kind of come down from that."
9734.0,Patient,my daughter gets older after I passed away she'll be able to read it and realize wow I didn't know.
462.0,Provider,yeah. So you can use that that's a great goal so you've kind of got the goal of just keeping your recovery going keeping the appointments group and all of that making amends cherishing the moment through making amends right and then finishing your autobiography and keeping it updated.
9734.0,Patient,"pretty much a motive, but yeah it's pretty much a little book that my life. A lot about just the bad shit it's about how far i've come, you know. Because I want that, currently, do you know. I mean, maybe today that'd be after i'm done i'll let you read it or copy it and send it to you or something, because I mean that will give you a real great outlook of my life, I mean. When I read that. You had to read the narrative when I had the rehab I was in it was like 1213 of us and I had to stand up and read in front of everybody, and the. Other clients, they could they can believe in it, it was so crazy seemed like Walt Disney Ronan I mean because, like my dad my dad gave me acid, when I was seven years old trick balls with you know seven."
462.0,Provider,"You know, inappropriate yeah."
9734.0,Patient,"My mother, when I was 15 I got my first got to when I was sick, they can. Okay, I had my son of 14 my dad my girlfriend sleep right my bedroom he didn't care oh."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
9734.0,Patient,"I don't hold anything against him for that. And you know my past I don't use that as an excuse for myself i've learned from my daughter. she's 12 years old. The shit I was doing at 12 years old and it's like well i've done good I took what happened to me and I made sure it never happened to her, you know, like she wants to get her nose pierced right now and it's like I don't know me anybody can think about that. Her mother I probably would have back slid and let her do a bunch of shit that I shouldn't you know so."
462.0,Provider,Right well that's good you're thinking and taking those decisions seriously learning from your past but you're right it doesn't help to blame anybody like your dad or anyone the lame doesn't help anything.
9734.0,Patient,nobody's perfect you know.
462.0,Provider,Right. Totally so.
9734.0,Patient,"My dad did the best he could I mean the way my dad was raised my God almost killed his father, when he was 16 and my dad was abuse his dad would put a gun to his head beat him back to my dad. I mean, he never spanked us if he cut me upside the head you'd start crying out for saying I don't want you to hate me like I hate my father."
462.0,Provider,"said cycle of trauma really is what it is like you said you can see, he was doing his best with what he had, which was. A lot of his own trauma."
9734.0,Patient,He raised me better than he was raised and i'm raising my kids better than I was ready So hopefully we'll see you know show brother doing keep that cycle going.
462.0,Provider,"Exactly breaking the cycles is is really hard, but so important within families learning new habits, creating. New healthy cycles it it's for me it's, not just for you it's for generations to come."
9734.0,Patient,"So you can't teach an old dog new tricks, let me tell you what you can."
462.0,Provider,"You you're right that I appreciate hearing that because you absolutely can, if you're ready to make changes tricks are there so that's. Great."
9734.0,Patient,that's great.
462.0,Provider,yeah okay good love to hear it i'm just happy to hear your updates and that things are going really well you've got some really good goals to focus on. Are you still senior outside therapist.

462.0,Provider,"Fantastic i'm glad to hear that okay oh. Do you want to make your appointment for April now, or do you want to just make a in group."
9734.0,Patient,kind of closer when it comes to far no.
