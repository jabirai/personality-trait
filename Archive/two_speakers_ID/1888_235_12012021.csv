By now she knows that he was he was trying to write a wheel out, you know and the thing is doing it behind your back, which is odd human but. So she knows that, obviously, I mean if you do not have back you know settings are you trying to get some stuff to us, I mean cuz and she didn't want it, she she doesn't want nothing to go to us, I don't think."
