I didn't have people during high school to talk to, and then like that. So I would always just it goes back to middle school because. But. For like a few occasions i've had a really big. middle school depression moment at some point. Because I had last person I had like really taken a liking to. Because uh and then it was also my best friend. And I don't know where she just gets the news that they're moving out of state."
759.0,Provider,Right.
17135.0,Patient,"And I lost her because she was the closest person to me like we talked to each other every day at that time I had first got my phone, so I. texted her a lot. And I was like back when when we had when we just got the texting cell phones, you know. yeah like for Blackberry and the ones that are sideways and you know. Just light up and stuff but um yeah and I remembered I went through like a phase where I just. felt like I lost it, I remember being in the corner every time after school Program. Nobody wants nobody nobody really wanted to talk to me around that time, so people tried. But I think after I shot myself in I didn't let anybody in. Around that time. It would happen, a lot during high school I would always skate around usually happens I try to do it when i'm when i'm not what people. i've had i've had a few breakdowns during school. Probably the most notable one was during my high school, it was my senior year. Okay, I was a math class I don't remember what it was, I was off that day I was terribly off that day. And I could feel it, I was you know. It was an anxious depression feeling but leaning more towards the depression heavily but I had that jitters I didn't want to stop moving I can't stop thinking, I had the that thick headed feeling that you get you know, like you. can record your head and it's sort of throb because you're trying to think about it and you keep thinking as it's doing that your feet your thoughts is like negative thoughts negative thoughts negative thoughts and I remember one of the things I always do is um I bite my tongue. Right. I bite my tongue or i'll put my nails and i'll take them into my head like calm down. Calm down, you know. You feel this focus on that calm down and um I would do that and it wouldn't work the teacher called me out it says hey focus, because at that time I put music to my ears, I had to drown it out and you obviously can't have headphones did during class. And most most cases. And she was one of those ones where you couldn't so should we went back and forth, and I said I can't I can't and I just fuckin I remember I just got up and I walked outside and. I don't remember if I if this is the one where I sat on the outside of the of the classroom or if I walked always cross. Because it wasn't a big school, this was a continuation slash actually high school is still count to the high school instead of a continuation."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17135.0,Patient,But um I went to the garden area and I sat on a bench I just let loose I just couldn't hold it in. that's probably the biggest one for that one.
759.0,Provider,So you felt like you know there's little people that kind of understood what you're buying Gerard that he.
17135.0,Patient,"it's not so much that they understand it felt more like. So it's like I always I think it's more back then, because more naive I would be like oh expect because of how many times i'm there for people. I expect them. To."
759.0,Provider,be there for you.
17135.0,Patient,"To be at least a few of them to be there for me. and have anybody. And then, if you didn't if you thought you did it was only like one or two times and then. it's like that. That are really there for you, it was just like it almost felt like they were just there because there were there. In the mobile. texting. And because of that. I would always skate. At night I would always be like 9:10pm 11pm PM am and I would be skating and I on my long word, and I would. just go just go, you know. go faster get my heart racing. enjoy it, you know, and then I would lay down in front of the school right next to the House and I would just stare at the stars blast my music if I cried I cried if I didn't I didn't want a wants to music gave me a headache but once I was tired or once it got too late, I went back. rinse and repeat whenever happened."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay, you know, so it wasn't so much that I didn't understand you, it was mostly because they want there for you like, he is he here for you. and"
17135.0,Patient,"Now I know not to expect it but it's like I still I still yearn for someone to be there, like that you know."

17135.0,Patient,"That like I feel a lot of things it really depends on the type of depression i'm being hit with. If it's being solely targeted on my loneliness that's the one I think I get I I get I hit him with the numb feeling the aikens body feeling I don't want to move, I want to just lay there. And just wallow in my sadness, for whatever reason, no Am I alone in this and that nothing, nothing at that one that time nothing interesting. xbox one I don't want to be on the phone I don't even want to go my phone I go to my phone I get I get irritated because everything reminds me of like other someone else or or you know it reminds me i'm lonely. Or why i'm on X boxes because. i'm lonely or whatever."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
17135.0,Patient,"And then I and then from there, I usually go to you know i'm tired of this are. The thoughts, you always make these thoughts are always always around during the depression moment. How much. They thought they're always around during depression moments it's the one the typical ones like like i'm i'm getting tired of. Living like this, you know i'm tired of being nowhere i'm being tired i'm tired of watching everybody be happy tired of feeling this loneliness this type of voice that seems to be unfixable you know. yeah like i'm unwanted, even though I know I have family around me.

As much as as much as I do, love being home low play my games, I also love traveling. I love I love meeting new people. I think i've come to notice that is that yearning for talking to people, makes me love talking to people.

And you. know your triggers to like if you're feeling lonely you know, like maybe I it sounds like you have some friends are reliable right some friends."
17135.0,Patient,"um, yes, but they've been going through things or we've been kind of a little bit of a distance. One of my longest term friends. i've known him for about five years going on to six, I think. he's been. he's been he's black box friend, but we've talked to each other i've seen him in on like video chat and stuff so I know what it looks like and we've always come to each other. there's times, where we won't even talk for a whole year, then. We find ourselves back to each other and we're enjoying each other's company again we come to each other when we're sad we talk to each other. he's always been one of the people I can go to and and one of the more recent terms, he actually would talk to me, and he remember he gave me a talk that I didn't want to hear you know, one of those you didn't want to hear, but you need to hear type of things. yeah and I remember he came in one of those so I know he's he's he's he's definitely he's definitely a really good friend. The other one would be my friend katie. she's a friend of mine from X box by I. Just a facetime or for I remember, I say summer every day, so we got really close. But recently she's gotten a boyfriend she went through a lot of trouble for a minute with depression and she needed her long time and then she got she finally got a chip on her boyfriend. And she's been doing her thing. As Now I know she wants to talk more but i'm. At the time, because of how attached, I was because I hadn't gotten used to that home. feeling wanted and yeah I had a best friend there you know. yeah and then it felt like it just disappeared. mm hmm because of the whole anxiety and separations attachment thing. i'm kind of i'm kind of nervous and going back to that, so I keep like she's asked me to jump back on and play with her. But i'm just like kind of. i'm kind of hesitate because. it's I don't wanna I don't want to grow that attachment again because that that hurts it really does."

17135.0,Patient,"yeah that's just like some of the things I can think of there's there's times, where I wouldn't even know what the trigger is or. Maybe there isn't a trigger and it's just. That whole and chemical balance then because there's times, where i'll get i'll get that in you and i'll feel it i'll get that rush of and chemical chemical balance and it's like my either it's my thought process and my focus and just drops or. or I become like very also to get that full head feeling like crap. Because i'm starting to to understand to know what that feeling is and. It kind of feels like like like southern versus inside my head almost like a rush of just like. Of like things touching they're gonna you know and it's like okay i'll kill you."

17135.0,Patient,"So we agreed to stick with lexapro because it's still the safer choice. And, but I was only taken 10 to 20 milligrams. So what it is i'm gonna start taking 10 per week double it to 20. And I think we're going to double it to 40. And then from there we're going to leave it for a little bit and see how see how it feels for like a few months. And then. And then she'll give me show me if she wants to add more to that she won't give me bigger pills or or she wanted she felt that we need to move into a different direction than we will. We have another drug in mind. it's the one that helps with sleep anxiety and depression."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.

759.0,Provider,"So stick with the lexi pro okay. hmm okay good Okay, I like that plan. yeah. yeah in terms of retreat man, what do you think any more me from you know, like do you want to and which direction, do you feel like we should head."
17135.0,Patient,"You know I don't know because i've never like I said i've never been on this side of things. i'm usually the person that's like in your in those shoes, but in like the you know in in that. yeah and. Then i'll listen in and i'll nitpick and I start to take Internet and I start to ask questions that are related to it and yeah that's usually what I do and i've never really I don't know what I would need so I don't know to be honest."
759.0,Provider,"All right, well, we can just do our talk therapy and we have some goals you have. That you're working on, what does the goals you know, like you feel like you want to work on a choice like you're improving your anxiety and depression, it says, you know, like a coping skill that you might want to learn, I know we talked about that last time as well you know, like. But the thing will help."
17135.0,Patient,"I don't know I think at the moment i've gotten a pretty good a pretty good handle different coping skills, I can take I don't know any for depression per se. Okay, no so I just know the one through anxiety."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, I think what depression. The more you can get outside world, the better, so if you feeling kind of like you don't want to get out of bed, you want to isolate. kind of pushing yourself to do the opposite, but just hard to do when you're in depression, but it's very beneficial. You know if you don't feel like getting on the bed, then you should push yourself to get out even go for a walk you know daily and take small steps, because their hurts depression does hurt it hurts to. You know mentally mentally. You know hurts, I think, the more you can engage, especially if on your triggers for depression as long this you know calling a friend, you know, like texting a friend. You know, like me, going out for lunch or coffee or something you know, like in order to engage more with the road around gym."
17135.0,Patient,"yeah I think we're will be getting out more I think my brother might come today, some of your sequence will take a drive and we'll just talk or something. Okay, I I wanted, I have a question. Do you have access to the to the to the results of my took the labs."
759.0,Provider,"Do I have access to the results, I think the medical doctor does."
17135.0,Patient,Talk to her okay.
759.0,Provider,Anything particular you're looking for.
17135.0,Patient,"Well, I was just trying to see if if my vitamin D was low because I remember last year, or maybe 2020 around there I had taken a test, maybe do labs and then they told me that my that my vitamin D was low whatever and then they gave me pills that had no give me vitamin D and large chunks. Now, take that like once a day or something like that or once a week I don't remember."
759.0,Provider,um let me see if I can see anything hold on.
17135.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,"I can't really see too much, but hold on. yeah you had to have a physician look at that for you."
17135.0,Patient,Okay that's fine I just it just occurred into my mind I think vitamin d also plays a part. yeah since i'm not I don't go outside and get sun that's usually the main source. You know and i've never i've never outside unless I need to be.
759.0,Provider,uh huh. So.
17135.0,Patient,I was probably contemplating maybe that that could be another another thing that's taken effect also has a deficiency better yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah. yeah. If you do have a vitamin D deficiency yeah. You don't want to you know definitely look at that.
17135.0,Patient,"All right, i'll probably talk to talk to her next week on Wednesday, when I get to see her."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Okay. All right, um I hadn't ended up I didn't I forgot i'm. In terms of me know, like, I do have a really good kind of like worksheet for depression, I want to look over can I send that to your email address.

759.0,Provider,yeah like Dean says you'd like to do that takes your mind off things.
17135.0,Patient,"I don't have a whole lot of them. it's really just drowning myself, I was music, you know um. let's see JEREMY myself, I was music I would try to watch stuff on my phone kind of he's not going to just start going through things. A big one is definitely what at the time it was my xbox for now it's kind of trying to do that with vr. But um yeah those are really the the biggest things. I if I talk to someone sometimes that'll help. I like to I like to be with people because being with people that's why, like the whole vr chat it's basically a social thing and I get to talk to a lot of people and sometimes you just meet those people that Bible."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah. So you like to chat with people, so you know, is there, p helping without being able to talk to people are you know."
17135.0,Patient,Learn oh. yeah oh. let's see this group therapy I wouldn't say I would I had enough time to see any difference in anything yet. yeah because um it's only i've only seen what i've been there for a month.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17135.0,Patient,over a month barely. So I think I read somewhere that four to five weeks so. Because this is only artist what 13.

17135.0,Patient,12345 to five weeks.
759.0,Provider,Five weeks okay. yeah. yeah.
17135.0,Patient,So yeah i've only seen her a handful of times.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, well, hopefully it starts to work like I know you say you like talking to people you like helping people you know so just being able to use that platform to for that. You know just being able to be a support you know for other people to can make you feel good in terms of who you are, as a person."
17135.0,Patient,Right.
759.0,Provider,"yeah like what do you know, do you want to you like helping other people do you feel like maybe you might want to volunteer somewhere, you know, to help people."
17135.0,Patient,"um I would love to I think I think if once I can go I feel confident, I can go out more. I would love to attend events and like maybe start off with a. With going to like the local dog pound or something you know, helping them out because I love dogs and. The cool thing is, you know you're not going to judge you know you're not good at that so it'll be an easier thing to do I not so much worried about judgment nowadays like I like back when I used to in high school."
759.0,Provider,But yeah.
17135.0,Patient,"I know I know it's always on the back of my mind everybody has some kind of some amount of worry about it, whether you gotten used to it or not."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, I like that plan for you like you have good ideas and things that you, you want to do you know it's a matter of execution, you know executing some of these plans and things that you'd like to do that, you know how to potential to make you feel good about yourself."
17135.0,Patient,"Another thing I think that that I might I might actually really like that could be helpful towards me is um. cuz I know you guys keep an eye on on how well we're doing and stuff like that, and I know just have that written down I would love to maybe see a chart in that showing on the on how well you know my mood is stabilizing. Okay, so i'm looking in you basically have like a graph chart and it had the line it shows Okay, this is you. And when we when we got you, and this is where you're at in this how you how high up."
759.0,Provider,"Here, if they have. You know, like we can see, you know some of our surveys and see how well you're doing from all surveys versus the once you've given to us."
17135.0,Patient,"By our I mean or you can just give me examples you know and like just tell me but, but you know. Just basically ring green encouragement, you know, like you know, this is actually helping, even if I may not feel like it and. Yes, I know it is, but sometimes one of the things we forgot to do is congratulate ourselves or like a. yeah no."
759.0,Provider,that's true.
17135.0,Patient,you're not doing this for nothing.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
17135.0,Patient,don't forget that.
759.0,Provider,"And you know for anyone's benefit, except for your own."
17135.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Often other thing I really got to work on as being. as being more selfish and less selfless is I i'm way too selfless I will put everybody's problems I had my. yeah it can be. I can be in the middle of having a manic episode and if someone says hey I really need your help, if I can I can like really take a breath take a breath i'll i'll wipe my tears, I stand up stand proud and then i'll hold the torch and walk them out of it."
759.0,Provider,yeah and you want to be able to do stuff for yourself.
17135.0,Patient,"yeah I think i've just started come to realization the last few years, I need to be selfless I need their selfish I need to start you know, putting myself first here in more occasions and. And you know. Stop you know just stop trying to you know. I don't know. I want to start helping people be happy, but like stop hyper focusing on that you know. and start involving myself on being happy to."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And what some of the ways that you kind of feel like you know you haven't been paying attention to kind of like your needs instead of painting instead of you know, giving more to other people."
17135.0,Patient,"So, so, in what ways."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And what ways, have you not been paying attention to like your needs."
17135.0,Patient,"So, like, for example, we can start off with with physical things right, you know money i'm not a selfish person with money had Oh, I really don't care. i'm glad I don't have that attachment to money you know, and I mean, I know I wanted, and I know I need it, and I know I would love to buy things, but if people want something and i'm not really learning to buy something. yeah here i'll help you i'll just pay me back you know Take your time. Oh, you want some food i'll buy food don't don't worry about it, I got it, you have been back. I do, that a lot, you know. I would normally I would use that lot, like, for example, when I used to work in school, and I want to use to work. i'm uncle's House I used to carry my my grandma and my aunt you know and that's when I used to get money, I asked get about 250 a week."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17135.0,Patient,"Everything about 200 a week i'm sorry and tell us to have money in my pocket I loved it, it was amazing feeling have money in your pocket, you know, because then every weekend I would always do the same thing i'd go to my grandma's House after that. Well, this is my uncle's house with my background, but I would go to my grandma's house. Right used to go to school and stuff you know. Show with my brother I would always buy buy food I would always buy a brand new. Mexican food from the next place right down the street, where my uncle is. My grandpa used to always a. His name is Bobby he's always i'm asked for money to take to the casino and then he paid me back because he just didn't want to the bank he had the money he has a lot to easily he just wouldn't want to go to the Bank at that late you'd like hey let me borrow let me borrow borrow 200. You know, I was, like all right here, you take it yeah. yeah I don't know I just I love seeing other people happy, so I guess that whole money side, help for a little bit too."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so just kind of like just giving freely, you know of you know, help you know either buying food and giving grandpa money that he would probably pay you back for. You know, things like that. yeah. make you feel good."
17135.0,Patient,"And then, so now going towards the whole myself in. My feelings of pushing them to the side and being there for other people is definitely a huge one you know. it's definitely something I need to I need to work on, because I can't keep stacking it because it's hitting harder and harder and there's only so much you can carry before you're going to collapse and it's going to be a great class, you know. yeah and those and those are the ones that that that i'm worried about, because I can handle these ones I may not feel I may not like it, and I made for like the world's ending for a little bit, but. they're not big enough to hurt myself usually know because obviously I don't got any cuts on me yeah in any danger but. yeah I feel like it's gonna. it's going to get there at some point, which is a fear. And usually, when I think when I. i'm overthinking so you don't want to think like that it's because there's a high chance of that happening."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17135.0,Patient,"And some. Some occasions, so I guess that whole. Putting myself ahead like if i'm anxious, you know, and I told him don't be there. I should just be like all right i'm sorry, can I handle us at the moment. i'll be back in like an hour or something no. yeah take my thing off or if i'm depressed you know, and you know and i'm trying to get help and then someone a person asked for help is is is asking you for help you know I need to be like i'm sorry I can't help your now i'm, not even in the right state of mind."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17135.0,Patient,I put myself first in every way.
759.0,Provider,"yeah you got to put yourself first yeah. yeah again make sure that you're you're good in order to help other people, you have to take care of herself, so you know, like I know we mentioned last time, a little bit of self care, you know things that you can do for yourself to take care of yourself. Each and every day, you know and it's all about that you know. yeah. Okay. So it's Nice. to know you today, you know a little bit more about what you go through you know the depression. Night yeah it's helpful information."
17135.0,Patient,"um. I asked something have you. asked me a question earlier, I think, because I don't know what it is right now. I would love it if you just knit pick certain topics that you feel like you'd want to you know focus on. Okay, and then, and then, if you want to circle back around and be like Okay, now that we have an idea I interrupt you, for a little bit you know, then. Okay, then you could tell me if there's an area that's falling into more or one that you want to focus on. Okay, because. i'm not uses so and I kind of liked that you're asking questions because I like to answer, no honestly I don't like to live I hate life, I really do so let's just be honest about it."
759.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, we can definitely do mark that give you more feedback yeah. But i'm really curious about these triggers you know, like in if we can come up with for more for less because I feel like if we can you know, like even though yeah just just such a thing as well call imbalances always going to be a little bit of a chemical imbalance. I actually have the one that that I know is definitely that takes part in it um."
17135.0,Patient,"I have, I come to conclusion I I hate being abandoned by by people you know and everybody does. Man but. Then there's other people that have issues where yeah it's a bigger deal, you know. When it goes down to the whole I get attached to easily you know. But in terms of that I don't necessarily mean you know that have a relationship, I mean more towards like friendship wise or something like that you know. So the whole. The whole like i'll be on xbox right, this will probably be some of the. ones I would remember about would be I was gonna inspire us and let's say my best friends are there, you know and then. You know we'll say maybe we've gone Ted or. You know, or they just weren't doing it, and then they just disappeared, you know my my put my like I told you my buddy Reaper does this all the time he's you know he's my friend that knows about five years and. He would just disappear on me and then, just like I got left behind and I hate it it's like because now I got nobody in and I and. I don't like it like. to the point where i'm kind of in somewhat of a relationship or now, but the with someone. In the in the cool thing is i'm trying to make it work. We have a few issues you know so i'm trying not to get too attached, but um she knows of my depression, anxiety she knows i'm struggling in life yeah and she's willing to be patient."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
17135.0,Patient,"she's willing to be patient and. And, and you know work with me on this so we're going to see how that works off, but i'm one of the things is like will be in game, and if we have like a disagreement. One of the things that she tried to do with would try to do is tease me right, sometimes when we disagree. To show that she's not happy. And in there, it would be like in vr chat you can block someone and then you know I can't see her and she can't see me. I can't hear her, she can't hear me type thing. yeah and I hate that because it feels like i'm going to be abandoned, like you know those thoughts of one of the like. What if she doesn't come back you know you know how much longer she didn't put up with this or am I really in the wrong it's like Okay, not a lot of hate this I don't like this."
759.0,Provider,It has there been a time in your life when you felt like you were abandoned by someone someone says.
17135.0,Patient,Oh yeah I don't I don't know about that.
759.0,Provider,"Oh, you dad."
17135.0,Patient,"yeah remember how I mentioned how he walked. away from us, I think that took a lot more of a toll than I anticipated. I may not feel it now, but I think. You know, deep I think it's rooted, I honestly think it's rooted. there's that. The whole losing my step dad thing because I was Okay, I want to say at that time I had that whole that whole. Unconditional love thing with my step dad, even though he abused the shit out of us, I mean my brother, you know and mom. I think we had that unconditional love type thing because he was a when I was there for us for a while. And then towards them high school, we lost our other step dad we were we were with him for at least six years, my mom was with them for about eight years so we're with them for about six to eight years. never having friends definitely played a part, so we moved around way too much, I went to 1312 total of 13 different schools, I can cow."
759.0,Provider,Oh wow that's around and.
17135.0,Patient,"that's basically one per year, but it but there's times, where we moved a few times in a year, so it wasn't necessarily one per year."
759.0,Provider,that's a lot.
17135.0,Patient,huh. It is.
759.0,Provider,"yeah you know, like i'm pretty sure you told me this before, maybe I forgot that moving around you know 1213 different times as. going to different schools, I mean that's a lot, you know, in terms of. Not having that states capability that you need."
17135.0,Patient,yeah and.
759.0,Provider,"And then also being abandoned by your father. For him just to walk away, you know, like yeah that it's kind of like might be a deep."
17135.0,Patient,"wound phone Oh, the most recent one was the one I told you about my about the step dad that was he was not she's not the type that now, but he was the one that was my mom's boyfriend before. He was the one that was with me during sophomore year we met him or on sophomore year my mom introduced us it was a very dark time that's when she was in her lowest over lowest points in life. So we weren't doing very well right now I won't say how or what happened or not know that but I remember um yeah you know we just didn't we were with him from there, I moved to my my grandma's house. And then he wants to jail for like a year, so my we end up going back and I end up moving back i'm back in with them, I would just them a lot, when I was when I was with my uncle I end up seeing my mom rotten. You know, and then I would end up moving back in with them, and I remember waylaid down the road right before the whole thing happened with him, I had mentioned, I think I mentioned to you that he had told me, you know, he would be there for me like I was depressed one one fourth of July. I was. You know just I hate I hate I started i'm sorry to hate on at that time I was really starting to hate the whole family getting to get together things because we just like the bigger the get together, the more the more like realization I was, I was alone like lonely. yeah you know, and I hated it because I was smile for a second and then get that drag you feeling, you know that it's like alright i'm back to being alone, you know. And that's what I thought back then. And I just start ignoring it and my heart was racing whatever it was whatever was going on the time. And he caught it and he had he had his for locals or whatever he you know alcohol he drank and he came up there. Right, and you know with his little happy sad because he kind of had this happy personality type thing you know, like. Like carefree but at same time he had cared about family, he was very big on family, so I think that's why he came to me and. He knows I was wrong something was wrong with me and he asked me two questions and number he nitpicked when it came to my dad and he goes. there's nothing you can do about your dad you're never going to give it to that feeling Okay, but just know I can I can help you with that I will be here for you. I can step in and be that bigger for you and I remember when he did that he hugged me and I had that for the first time ever that kind of grasp that I hadn't felt until long. Like like there's actually someone there for me, I remember I broke down. And then that same day same day he found out that that he had cheated on my mom and. Things went downhill, so I felt like. When I thought I had a figure of someone I could possibly look up to."
759.0,Provider,You can.
17135.0,Patient,"Do. It was like I got smacked run the hands like not you're not allowed that kind of feeling, you can have that kind of person in life. And, and I know that definitely put a partner."
759.0,Provider,"yeah and it's kind of like someone else that was you know exiting your life to just like a father. yeah. yeah so you had that happen, you know, not by choice you know, like are by circumstances that you before part of you had that happen to yourself, you know twice. In a sense."
17135.0,Patient,"hmm. yeah but um yeah, I just wanted, I just wanted to bring that when I know that, once again, part of the whole topic we're talking about."
759.0,Provider,"yeah man, the man yeah."
17135.0,Patient,"I think the whole loneliness can also when we're talking about longest environment, I think the loneliness. The school thing that we were mentioning not having any friends and stability, like you said definitely played a part with the loneliness thing because I didn't have that childhood friend, or I never had the chance to have your childhood friends, you know. yeah you to grow up normal like a lot of more stable kids would."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you never really had that childhood friend. No, no, because you moved around so many times. How could you, you know, with all the moving around that you get in your in your life, you know. yeah. yeah. Well, you know, like we can only learn from the past, we can all always like heal from the past, we can't change events and things that circumstances that had. In the past, but we can definitely talk about it and see how it affects each day."
17135.0,Patient,"How the Pal yes, yes i'm a very big believer on you know, on that whole it is what it is type of persona. And the whole it is what it is personal like i'm not to live necessarily carefree. But if it's unnecessary and you don't need it and it's not really worth being bothered don't let it bother you know. If it's not a big deal it doesn't be bothered now don't let it, you know. I don't like holding grudges. I don't like stay mad yo if you were if you were ever in my family and you would ever know you and you ever seen an argument you'll notice that maybe. One moment i'll be heated and then 30 minutes, an hour i'm talking to everybody fine and i'm not faking it i'm actually back to the good. kind of like grudges i'm like the whole grudge thing."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah like that whole grudge thing.
17135.0,Patient,yeah because it does create awkward moments and awkward moments I hate.
759.0,Provider,"yeah and holding grudges kind of just like sometimes can hurt you and your wife and to hurt you, you know. If you are not being able to like or just go or."
17135.0,Patient,"What was it. What was it a holding a grudge is like take it is like a. it's like making a. drink, full of poison for your enemy, but drinking it yourself."
759.0,Provider,As like that.
17135.0,Patient,"I think that's a quote, that I got from somewhere. I don't know it's like drinking poison and hoping, because your enemy that's what it is."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah so we yeah we talked about a lot today, I think, knowing your triggers knowing what the things that we can work on together it's helpful. You know long is failure abandonment, you know those three things we talked about depression, you know, like in terms of how you feel when you're depressed. And you know just retrieving and you know, the more better you can engage with the rug around you with depression, the margin better so we talked about that we also talked about your childhood your father, leaving your stepfather like he did cheating on your mother and then."
17135.0,Patient,"He did, and he did. yeah he he was a very big part I mean it's so bad, to the point I don't even know my my first language so that that's just an idea of how how bad."
759.0,Provider,How bad it got yeah yeah. yeah. So we talked about a lot today.
17135.0,Patient,Actually. I actually like the progress we've made today. I actually do.
759.0,Provider,"yeah good good um I wanted the next couple weeks, I sent you over the depression work she don't want you to give that look over and like you say you, you have different coping skills for different things. I want you to really nail down some of the goals and things that you want to do in your life, you know and think about how am I going to pursue the things I wanted you. I want you to think along those terms, you know, like if I want to be a trucker whether some of the things I needed to do in order to be a trucker you know get my driver's licenses a part of that. You know, like if I want to help other people where can I go to volunteer at different places, you know if I want to volunteer at the dog. Our dog shelter shelter animal shelter How does that look so I want to give those things dot you know because I feel like if you're doing things that you like to do the more better you're going to feel about yourself. Okay okay."
17135.0,Patient,"Also, also putting some more thoughts into those and then, when I would be able to start doing that."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah I think looking at it that way it's going to be helpful okay. mm hmm okay let's make it time for you to come back for next time okay.
