2057.0,Patient,Hello.
107.0,Provider,"I am doing alright, how are you doing."
2057.0,Patient,i'm doing okay. We got.
107.0,Provider,A little lights back on.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah it's weird there's like a couple of them that have gone out but they're like when you set it to one color like, for example, it's blue, but the three that are broken or right now read."
107.0,Provider,Oh that's.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah and it's like when you turn it green it's like fine and then, when you turn it to a different color is like a different it's weird i'm not sure what's going on. As long as it's not broken though cuz."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
2057.0,Patient,"That would suck. yeah i've been okay had an okay birthday, I was like in a bad mood for most of it. I really wanted. To come see me like that night like late that night. But she said she had stuff she needed to work on. And I kind of got upset with her, because I was like you know, this is the one thing that i've asked for, is just to like have time. with you and then she kind of got mad back at me and she was like live spent all this time on you're getting together your gifts and like that's my love language and like she felt like I was being ungrateful or something and I was just like okay. Like it's not worth fighting about but. I was like in a bad mood for like part of the next day, which was like my birthday, we ended up going to. The forest with sable and that was nice and then we went to drop off some of her art stuff at the art studio and that was fine, then we got food and a new, it was like more or less fine but. yeah I just kind of like a disappointment. Like when I think about it. Which like I don't know why, like, I feel like it was a disappointment, I guess, I just like I don't know I don't know if i'm being like i'm grateful, or whatever, but."
107.0,Provider,What did you imagine happening.
2057.0,Patient,"I don't know like I wanted her to come, like that night and her to stay the night, and then the next day, like, for us to sleep in and and do a lot of the things that we did. I just imagined being in like a better mood. So I don't know."
107.0,Provider,"What. What would have helped you be in a better mood, do you think."
2057.0,Patient,"Like if she had just come over that night like because I felt like she wasn't prioritizing like my birthday, you know what I mean like she had all week because she said she needed to work on art stuff for this. gallery showing that she's doing, and she like had the whole week she had several weeks to prepare and then she like took that day off of work, I think it was like her, taking the day off of work and then still being like i'm too busy to see you was like oh okay. i'm like I think it was like the combination of those two things, where I was just like. Okay, but like you need to work on stuff now you have like you called it off of work you have all this all of today that you worked on it, ostensibly you know because, like what else, are you working on that's like another thing is like. I don't know she says she's really busy, but then like I don't think she's actually spending a lot of that time doing actual work. Not that that should matter, I guess, I don't know. Part of it feels like. I don't know it part of it feels like not the healthiest like. Like I it was something like this has always been like a problem with me when I like when I get into relationships right, just like want to be with the person all the time. and that's not necessarily the way that I would like, when I think about myself in a relationship that's not like the way, I would like it to be, I would like to obviously like have time apart that's like healthy. But I just. I don't know, I find myself going back to that same pattern."
107.0,Provider,There anything that you might be worried about if you don't spend time with the person that they might.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah they show like find somebody else and like cheat on me or something you know, like that's like it's like that. I did have a conversation with her about the open relationship thing. Because, when we were. We were both like. When she was having that panic attack, I was in that like really bad depression and. Like. She had she had recommended a sex therapist and, like the. Sex therapist that I found were like all about open relationships and stuff and then I was like is that something you want, she said I don't know, we had a conversation about that. Because I was basically ready to break up with her if she was going to say like yeah That is something that I want. To cover is like. You know. i'm still skeptical about the changing of the mind. Like so quickly, because when I did confront her about it. She said she didn't want an open relationship, and I was like are you just scared that like i'm going to break up with you, and she was like no, I think that my previous relationship. Like really. Like affected me negatively, and a lot of different ways and like one of them was. You know. I guess thinking that maybe an open relationship would solve the problems of of the relationship. Which like I understand. And, like, I do believe her but. yeah there's always that like. That fear and that jealousy in the back of my mind I don't know why that is like such a thing already."
107.0,Provider,What do you mean already.
2057.0,Patient,"Like it's only been like you know, a couple of months."
107.0,Provider,But she really liked her.
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So your attachment to her is stronger now. Earlier, because you really liked her as opposed to other people that you liked, but maybe not as intense."
2057.0,Patient,yeah. yeah it's like the fear of of just losing it.
107.0,Provider,So how can we create some. move towards balance in this process. so that you can stay in the relationship and navigate fears of losing.
2057.0,Patient,"Okay, I don't know. I don't know because there's nothing that she's really done, aside from like. You know. When I asked her about the open relationship and she said she didn't know like there's nothing that she's done that's like made me think that. That she's gonna find somebody else but. I don't know the way that she handled her last relationship and like that whole situation doesn't make me feel good about it, you know. How she waited and waited and plans to break up with that girl who she still lives with which is still weird."
107.0,Provider,Maybe that's kind of antagonizing some of your concerns.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah definitely is. And i've tried to talk to her about it, you know i've let her know i'm like yeah this is weird and. She was just kind of like i'm sorry I was like. yeah definitely it doesn't it doesn't help anything that's for sure."
107.0,Provider,So last week. When you were feeling pretty down. yeah it sounded like you were feeling pretty one sided about the whole situation that. You were working really hard. And she was not.
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,How do you. feel about it now.
2057.0,Patient,"I still do kind of see myself, you know, like doing and saying things that are. More demonstrative of like how I feel. Then, maybe, she is like I got her an iPad in Christmas, for example."
107.0,Provider,What are some things that she can do that would give you a sense of more balance in the relationship so it can feel less one sided.
2057.0,Patient,"I don't know because part of me likes to be to like serve her you know. Like there's something about about that service that. I find really. Like satisfying and so like part of it is like. I don't know it just doesn't seem. Like I guess in terms of things she could do. She does all the right things you know it's not like she. does anything. While we're together that's like bad, I think it just in terms of like that one sided comment like I just think that. yeah it's weird she like picks and chooses what to care about like if i'm saying, like, for example, I I was like feeling kind of sick to my stomach for like a couple days last week, and she. Like. ordered me food which I didn't really want. and She like boys that she was. You know she felt like she doesn't like feeling helpless against. Like things that i'm going through she wants to feel like she's helping and like doing stuff."
107.0,Provider,And he hadn't she do that by ordering things or yeah. stuff like that it sounds like.
2057.0,Patient,yeah very much so.
107.0,Provider,"So do you think that she does enough of that or do you think that it's just that it's hard for you to appreciate it, because it's not necessarily the way you would do things and so it's hard to."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah it's not necessarily how I would do it, and I think that the part of that is. Where that feeling comes from. um. I don't know I feel like it's one of those things where I just wanted to work so bad. That like i'm panicking and. shut up you know, like that's how."
107.0,Provider,"So. In the past. This is definitely been a theme for you when you're really worried about losing something you start getting. Anxious and then you start looking for reasons to be anxious. And then that adds to the anxiety and then you're snowballing down the road of negativity. So how can we shift that, because this is an early relationship. it's great that you like her, and that she likes you how can we create a little more balance so that you can have the opportunity for a different experience."
2057.0,Patient,yeah I don't know I feel like if I knew that I would just do it.
107.0,Provider,"Well it's a little bit of a rhetorical question to give you the opportunity to think about what are some other ways to do. So. I think your service work is about having purpose. That you do really well in your job world and negotiating the outside world from that perspective, and maybe being of service to her lets you connect to that piece, and so, then you have a purpose or a job, if you will. yeah and then it makes sense. So I like that idea let's build on something that you can wrap your head around, and that makes sense to you. But maybe let's give you some additional jobs not take that job away because it's very gratifying to you, so I think that we need to keep that but maybe we can add some other jobs, so that we can start to balance this out a little bit."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So one of the jobs could be, and this may seem really silly and stupid it's just a suggestion that you keep track of and literally maybe writing down. The different things that a mood is trying to do to acknowledge your relationship or acknowledge you in the relationship and even though it's not stuff you would normally you would do or normally connect to by allowing yourself to see the list. And kind of the ongoing efforts that are being made, maybe that'll help you connect to that a little differently. and connect to her a little differently. it's not something you need to share with her so much is so kind of that she gets credit. And you know mentally for you and for her because it would be, it is frustrating for you, when you feel like she's not appreciating all the efforts, so the best way to manage that or balance that is to make efforts so appreciate it on your end."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So that's you know let's use, something that is the point for you to help you have a point for her. So that could be a job that because you're literally going to have to write it down because you're not going to keep track of it in your head and you're not really supposed to anyway that's kind of. yeah you said headspace. So keep track of it to just as a visual to be like Okay, no she is doing stuff that's right maybe I wouldn't necessarily connect to that or I wouldn't do that, but that is her doing something that is her making an effort."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And, just as you want her to have a balanced life and do other things, to take care of work and and her our knowledge different things that she's doing. You need to do the same thing, so what is something that you can do that would be comfortable enough for you to do. That you can kind of keep the balance there, so you go to work yay I know it's telecommuting it's not as exciting as being able to go in, but maybe there are some things you could do with sable a little bit more on your own. or something or maybe you can make a point to talk to all our goober a little bit more often, or something else to allow you to have a little more balance for you."
2057.0,Patient,yeah. yeah because that is the other hard part is that I don't have any friends up here that I can like go go see it's like 100% of the people that I see during the day or a move like amongst friends and. it's really hard for me to make new friends and like.
107.0,Provider,"I think you should spend some time connecting to the ones you already have, and even though it's not in person it's better than nothing."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah I try to maintain like a good, solid line of communication with gabby like we have a weekly call that we do with. his girlfriend and. of law school friend of his name yada. Good and like it's been weird because, like ever since i've known governor governor's like tribe Members like the type of person who like tries to get his friends to be friends like he really wants that. And, like every time he'd be like i'm gonna hang out with jada do you want to come and i'm like does she want me to come, you know, like always had that insecurity like that does she want me there. And I guess the answer was yes. And gabby would always like make fun of me like about that and he's always like really good at like. Like anytime I had like a like insecurity he's like really good at like making a joke about it that, like is like so like it makes me laugh, and then it like points out the. The insecurity in a way that's like not."
107.0,Provider,"Good. So you know. nobody's perfect big ever has more good than bad so you need to hang out with Deborah and whatever crazy people he brings along with them good crazy. And I think, maybe more than just once a week, maybe. You know you throw in another time there in the middle of the. Week, maybe and same thing with all I think you need. Work tab a little extra support, especially because they're not right around you, and there was a plan for you to move down there which may still happen you never know. You have your Vegas trip coming up soon."
2057.0,Patient,yeah I was just gonna mention that.
107.0,Provider,That next week.
2057.0,Patient,"That is next week. All of a sudden, it is it's like here if."
107.0,Provider,Sometimes.
2057.0,Patient,"we're doing and like I don't know I don't really like see myself as like the type of person who does stuff like this, who like plans for a thing and then does it. Like it's always just been like. I don't know like a trip to Vegas is like just so something that I wouldn't do. You know, because it's like something that you do with other people."
107.0,Provider,"Well now, you have other people in your life. It just happens to be Vegas."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm excited about it and. I like called the. place that sable is saying that, like everything is good they're. Good I watched like they have this live feed have. Like three different rooms, that they have. Stable just farted. Jesus."
107.0,Provider,I can relate to those terrible smells.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah it's like they're always silent, but they're like always just like. On a trading. Yes, penetrating. What was I saying."
107.0,Provider,The Lima beans three different rooms.
2057.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah and until I watched the live feed of the dogs and like it's just you know, a bunch of dogs hanging out and. But it looked like fine, it was a big space, so he has enough space. Like it's basically a warehouse with bedrooms that they have. yeah and. So. That should be okay i'm still a little bit nervous about that part."
107.0,Provider,"it's different. it's understandable, you know it's all good until you get through it all so. yeah. It sounds like it's gonna be great."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah my boss was like Oh, do you want to visit Pittsburgh, and I was like God and then i'd have to board my dog for $100 a night to go to Pittsburgh. I didn't say no to him, but I was like in my head, I was just like, of all places."
107.0,Provider,Is there a job site there something.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's where all of them work. Oh hello, like my boss."
107.0,Provider,"Well, maybe it'd be nice to meet. Everybody in person or see them in person again we're yeah."
2057.0,Patient,"No, I met my boss one other time he's like a golden retriever like."
107.0,Provider,"Oh that's right. yeah remember yeah you were super annoyed with him and then all of a sudden, you realize. yeah retriever and now he's just annoying because he's a golden retriever which is lovely and entertaining and. We also."
2057.0,Patient,"points out like when he, like notices when i'm like depressed like I guess it's like that noticeable that because he's brought it up twice like this time in the last time I was depressed he he brought it up. you're just like just you know, trying to make sure I was Okay, I guess, but. I don't know this last time it kind of made me uncomfortable I kind of snapped at him I was like. yeah I don't know what to say other than like I deal with depression and like I you know i'm okay I just like it's something I deal with."
107.0,Provider,"Well, there was a time period before where you just wouldn't even go to work so now you're going to work because you're. Going on unquote functional enough to go and. But you still have to deal with their stuff and you have to deal with yourself and it's a lot, you have comes so far. I am so amazed and proud of how hard you worked to get to this place, and I know that there are still some very dark tough times so i'm not trying to be dismissive of that. But I do really want you to hear and understand that I am very proud of all the hard work you've done and you really are doing an amazing job of. of taking care of yourself and dealing with very tough circumstances it's hard to go through all the shit that you've gone through and get to a place of not just living life but functional and working through what that means I mean."
2057.0,Patient,You know.
107.0,Provider,"it's you know, this is what people who don't have terrible Depression and anxiety struggle with just day to day functionality stuff so you're at a place now, where you get to do some of that yay. it's a lot of it's a lot of work but you're doing a great job of taking it on so i'm excited that you're even contemplating something like going to Pittsburgh and doing a work trip NUTS amazing."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"i'm not saying you have to do it, I just think it's amazing or even considering it."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I might do it, it just depends on like how long it is how many days, because $100 a night is the waterboarding."
107.0,Provider,It is.
2057.0,Patient,I mean it's it's not a lot for boarding but it's a lot.
107.0,Provider,it's a lot it adds up for sure.
2057.0,Patient,A lot.
107.0,Provider,"yeah dog is rubbing up against I have blinds behind me to keep you know kind of corn to my little space here and my dog keeps rubbing up against it i'm just waiting for the whole thing to crash on my head. And let me just apart. So I don't know what's happening celebrating life like I don't know what so there's a weird kaboom and I make a sudden movements, because. yeah he's really strange yeah he's broken the set all right let's hope that doesn't happen. So I you know we we kind of talked a while ago about the survey that you did and and just the your kind of work, your sense of of self in work is so much stronger than your sense of self with you. And it's it's hard and when you. struggle, you really struggle like it, because you don't have an anchor or a sense of self that's strong enough yet to feel like tough times are not. an abyss."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"But the good news is is that you do have a strong very strong sense of self when it comes to work life, and when it comes to having a purpose and all of that, even though. You can't really connect to that or it's hard to connect to that when you're struggling Those are the things that kind of help you get through that. So the reason i'm bringing any of this up, is that I want to keep using that piece, that you are stronger in to help build up. your sense of self within you so that, as you deal with this kind of low roller coaster of emotions that you're going to continue to have. As a part of your gig meds are helping, but you are going to continue to develop each time you ride one of these waves out it's going to give you a sense of. Okay, that really sucked but I survived yeah and it's really important to acknowledge that you survived, because then the next time a wave hits. you're going to there's going to that knowledge is going to be there somewhere Okay, this is really going to suck but I survived last time. So i'm probably going to survive this time, but it really sucks and so, the more we can establish that and then, the more we can move you towards purpose and connection i'm sorry, let me just take care dogs. Oh, I see he's grabbed a yoga mat and he thinks he should lay on that. Oh. My gosh okay sorry about that, so the more that we can get you connected to that purpose and sense of self that stronger and your work life. and help you kind of build and understand that you have purpose and you do have things to contribute and you are an amazing individual, then we can build that piece up so that in harder times it's not quite so devastating. So that's kind of what i'm hoping to do here with the balance and the relationship with the mood. Because I agree with you, it, it does need to be a little bit more balanced, and I think there's probably a lot of positive things that are happening here, so how can we acknowledge that but also give you the opportunity to have a balance, a little more balanced perspective for yourself. yeah so that's my agenda. Just to be clear. Is that okay. yeah okay."
2057.0,Patient,"I just like. I don't know I hate these depression, like us, depressions."
107.0,Provider,You know that sucks.
2057.0,Patient,"it's um. It just feels like it takes up so much of my life. And it's just like so hard to fight against and like there's it's always it's always just blah and then sometimes it's you know worse than blah. And like. just sitting with that and, like riding through that as. Well worst."
107.0,Provider,"So if there are ways to kind of. increase the block so that it's less blah and a little more like. Positive neutral, if you will. yeah then then hopefully when things are crummy it's less of a plummet. So, the more we can kind of pull up the status quo, then, then when things are feeling crappy hopefully they won't go quite so low."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So that's where like now you're doing okay you're better than you were last week, or at least that's the way it appears to me. What would you say okay."
2057.0,Patient,I would agree with a.
107.0,Provider,"Good so now is the time to kind of find ways to make it a little less blah you're going into this trip it's probably going to be overstimulation mode. On some level because it's just so. Different so maybe just allowing yourself to participate and allow yourself to just be with your friends and allow yourself to just kind of ride out this trip. That you would normally that you would never have imagined on some level ever taken yet here you are so. Maybe every time you want to second guess that decision or second guess what are you doing here second guess you're going to kind of say okay. Yes, there's that thought i'm going to set that aside i'm just going to ride this out i'm here. i'm with my friends i'm just going to work to enjoy that so every time you want to kind of be like whoa what's happening here. Just yet no it's cool we're good we're you know now if you're contemplating jumping out of an airplane you don't have proper equipment definitely put the brakes on that don't do. But you see what i'm saying so. go with the normal kind of day to day enjoy the trip for what it is it's going to be very different and that's probably going to feel very weird, but it does not all weird things have to be bad."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,And maybe just allow yourself to kind of see have this experience.
2057.0,Patient,yeah I mean i'll do my my best.
107.0,Provider,yeah no and you're gonna. yeah go ahead.
2057.0,Patient,I was just gonna say and like there's gonna be a lot of drinking too so i'm just going to try to like pace myself and. You know not make a fool of myself.
107.0,Provider,And how about eat are we doing in the food department is a little bit better than it was.
2057.0,Patient,"i'm throwing up plus I can't remember the last time I threw up, I thought about doing it last night, but I didn't."
107.0,Provider,Are you eating anything.
2057.0,Patient,"Eating some you know, like a moose getting me lots of food. and Like she ordered a lot of stuff for herself and then like doesn't eat it and I have a thing about food waste so i'll eat some of her stuff but. yeah she's noticed. She was like she mentioned it she's like you're not eating enough and I was like okay. I don't know how to respond to that. I just kind of danced around the subject of my change the subject. But she definitely noticed."
107.0,Provider,So that's a good thing that she noticed and that she's trying to help you.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely was yeah. I don't know she was trying to be like it's an indicator that you're not doing well, I was like no you're not allowed to say that."
107.0,Provider,What is she allowed to say.
2057.0,Patient,I don't know. it's hard because usually i'd get really like mad or embarrassed if somebody pointed out my eating disorder. But I don't get that way with her.
107.0,Provider,Is that a good thing.
2057.0,Patient,I don't know.
107.0,Provider,I don't know just different.
2057.0,Patient,Just different.
107.0,Provider,"Different is different, we can let it just be that. yeah so are there, certain foods that you can eat right now, at this point. All except low variety for regularity."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah I know the moods going to come over tonight we have like a. we're going to go to a drag show, but I think she's gonna make us dinner beforehand i'm not sure what she's gonna make."
107.0,Provider,"You like the food that she likes I mean, are you guys both vegan I know you are."
2057.0,Patient,And she is not a vegan and i've made. Like a lot of stuff stuff that I look stuff that I like. But that I wouldn't normally. make a lot of for myself.
107.0,Provider,i've.
2057.0,Patient,"Basically, been. Trying to like show her like look, you can eat vegan and it can be delicious and it's not like something that you have to think about which which work she was like you know I I don't even notice that this food is vegan when i'm eating it like. But she doesn't really know how to cook vegan her last couple attempts have been pretty."
107.0,Provider,"it's not easy, it sounds easy but it's not you can screw it up pretty quickly burn it or or dry it out or it's."
2057.0,Patient,"just not enough there's not enough food, not enough variety of. So. I don't know I don't know what she's gonna make I know that she's gonna make a salad when I like her salads so. That should be fine. And there's still Hello leftovers like Hello leftover Indian food and stuff. And that stuff that all like more instead of like sitting down for like heating, some of it up and eating a meal of it all like eat a cold out of the refrigerator standing up and then like consider that lunch. Because it's like not something that I want to portion out. But then Aside from that, like. Her snacking has been bothering me a little bit less. And i'm not sure why that is. Maybe i'm just getting used to it. Or maybe she's not doing it as much i'm not sure. I don't know if that answers your question about what types of food."
107.0,Provider,"you're you're eating you guys are trying to eat together. Yes, trying to learn, which I think is great and you're allowing her to make these comments, even though you say she can't say those things you're not reacting or dismissing. yeah having a slightly different reaction, which is good because different is always allows for a progression so that's great yeah. So even that sounds like it's in a better place today than it was last week."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah. One thing that has not shifted at all is this fucking breakout on my face like holy Fuck it's been you can't really tell them this light, but you can't really tell us like but. it's bad it's like. I bought this new stuff from sephora and like I read the instructions on the website before I bought it of how to use it and then I used it for maybe like three weeks. And I started to develop like this rash right here. And so I stopped using it and I looked at the bottle and the bottle underneath the directions for use it says, if you develop a rash contacted physician and I didn't. That part they left out of the online thing or the online instructions yeah if that had been included in the online instructions I don't think I would have been brave enough to try it. And I just doused my face in it for three weeks, and then I like the rash around here has kind of gone away, but it's just like bloomed into like acne on my like this whole part of my face and, like my chin and it's been like that, for over a month and it's making me feel really insecure."
107.0,Provider,Do you have the ability to go see a doctor banner dermatologist or.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah a lot of the dermatologists are like not taking patients until after the holidays know, I do have an appointment on January in January. But i'm going to try to find something sooner, I think it's just hard because between the trip to Vegas which is next week and then Christmas, which is the following week and then do yours, which is the following week I don't think that all. be able to. yeah I don't think i'll be able to."
107.0,Provider,I wonder if urgent care can handle something like that doesn't always have to be urgent urgent to go to urgent care.
2057.0,Patient,"I don't know it feels like. I don't know it doesn't feel urgent enough to be urgent care, I guess, some people would do that but I don't see myself doing that."
107.0,Provider,"i'm thinking, one of the standalone clinics is not going to the emergency department of a hospital."
2057.0,Patient,yeah I mean maybe I think i'm just going to try to call some places like a lot of the places that have booking on the webs on like online are the ones that.
107.0,Provider,Are maybe get on a waiting list.
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,last minute cancellation kind of gig.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah definitely last minute cancellations would be ideal. I don't know she's making me feel so insecure like a mood sends me all these cute pictures of herself and, like, I want to send you pictures back, but I fucking look like a scaly monster, and all of them. Like the body dysmorphia doesn't help but. it's just like at this point my skin is just like so angry with me. I don't know."
107.0,Provider,that's why i'm thinking you know if you could get into see somebody sooner rather than later.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah I know. Aside from that, I guess, other things that have been going on. include. My grandma. So we've had this like back and forth. Communication where. She was like you know just let and she's like I want a relationship with you just let me know the the terms, basically, and I was like you know. This is, I was like To be honest, this is why I don't reach out more the abuse and she was like and I was like the fact that you know. This that it happened, and that when I tried to confront you about it, you say you don't remember it she's like can I have some examples and I gave her some examples which was like. shouldn't have to do that, and she and then she responded with well I just think we remember things differently and i'm like. Okay. And then I told her, I was like, if you want terms of like you know what's needed to have a better relationship with me, you need to apologize and. I told her, I was like I don't know if that's something that you'll even be able to do for me, but it would be, it would go a long way and then she kind of was just like oh sorry she was like. She was like oh i'm like dealing with an irritable bowel thing i'll try to respond to your message like later, but basically just like putting it off. and trying to be like oh happy birthday, by the way, I got you this, you know here, I sent money. And a birthday check and like. tried to change the subject and definitely did not give an apology. So that was loud and clear, you know. That i'm not going to get that from her."
107.0,Provider,You might you never know.
2057.0,Patient,And I doubt that it would be sincere.
107.0,Provider,"Well, she struggles with sincerity across the board. yeah I think you'll get what you get and hopefully she gives you something and. it's probably all she's capable of."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah it's like weird like part of me wants to. I don't know. The logical stronger part of me is like don't tell her about a mood. Because if you, you know, God forbid, something happens between the travel bug and we break up like i'd never heard waned of yeah."
107.0,Provider,"Wait wait. If you have that thought process again, then we can circle back around, but now."
2057.0,Patient,I just don't want her to weaponize the relationship.
107.0,Provider,that's right get to let's work on some of this other stuff to see if we can help you feel stronger about yourself before we let grandma know about that stuff.
2057.0,Patient,"Because it's like we have nothing to talk about because I never talked about anything in my life, and she doesn't have dog shit going on, you know. Just like doctors appointments and stuff like that, like she goes to the doctor."
107.0,Provider,Constantly your hobby.
2057.0,Patient,"Constantly and i'm sure it is her hobby like I don't think that she's like that old and sick, you know what I mean. I don't know like she just has always been a hypochondriac. Her whole life. And it's just like. Oh i'm sick with this first initially it's like a. Like she broke her arm and then it was the broken arm for a long time, and you know, like yes, she broke her arm like you know. But now the arms healed now and so she doesn't have anything else to talk about now with irritable bowel. which I think my aunt crystal. suggested that it might be and, like my. Personal is like you know, not all there mentally and I was like I think you should get some tests from the doctor before you start telling people to you have ibs. yeah it's like. Part of me wanting to. Wanting to share stuff with her, but then like knowing that I can't."
107.0,Provider,"yeah Thank you you're gonna have to share, about books you've read or stories you've heard or. More surface things and. I know that but she's not capable of anything more than that and it'll be that much full to try and have any other kind of interaction with her because it'll just be disappointing."
2057.0,Patient,yeah I haven't even told her about Vegas because I know that the minute I say something about Vegas the.
107.0,Provider,First. I think he's gonna fly there her and visit with her.
2057.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah. I agree, the first thing out of her is like her mouth not would not be like oh that's exciting, it would be like."
107.0,Provider,"Oh, when he coming to me when."
2057.0,Patient,You come into yeah when you come to visit me.
107.0,Provider,yeah no don't talk about. know. you're spending time with friends it doesn't matter where there are where you are with them oh.
2057.0,Patient,yeah she knows governors and. She goes by friends are in southern California she tries to like weaponize that.
107.0,Provider,To like she does I.
2057.0,Patient,she's just like. she's more annoying now than anything.
107.0,Provider,"Well that's good. I would rather her be annoying then. Emotionally barbering, which is where it was for a long time. yeah now I think you've kind of come to a place of a little more just essential acceptance that she is limited and what she is. actually able to do."
2057.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And that's disappointing and frustrating, but it is what it is, and as you become more and more just accepting of that, the easier it is to deal with her ridiculousness and it becomes a more muted conversation. Because to do anything else is the setup for failure."
2057.0,Patient,"yeah. This shirt is to excel, I only wanted one XL. and never noticed the one that you're."
107.0,Provider,yeah wearing yeah. it's cute.
2057.0,Patient,yeah Thank you. It was a discount because. They sold a bunch during Halloween and they offered a discount. For host Halloween gear. I was like oh dog where this all. year round don't.

107.0,Provider,"Five o'clock okay. yeah we could do Wednesday, but I imagine you're going to be busy trying to pack and different things that might be stressful."
2057.0,Patient,Monday works wonders. Five o'clock.
107.0,Provider,"Yes, ma'am okay."
2057.0,Patient,"All right, thank you Joanna."
107.0,Provider,Thank you it's great to see you.
2057.0,Patient,yeah it's good to see you too.
107.0,Provider,"Take care bye. Okay, so I think we are still at moderate suicide level because it's miss Cassandra and we're not completely out of the woods, but we are definitely in a in a better headspace today so yay to that. So, in terms of treatment planning she's agreed to the idea of working on developing her sense of self through her purpose in work life, because that's such a strong sense of self and so identifying purpose in her personal life will. start to build that skill set and create some more neutral bandwidth, which is what she desperately needs so i'm glad that she's kind of agreed to that and that that's something she's willing to do. I think, creating balance in her relationship with them will be really important, so how she spends her to how Cassandra spends her time. outside of her relationship with the moon spending time with her friend goober and Allah and spending time with sable and. taking care of work it's a big deal that she went to work despite feeling crappy that's you know the sign of functionality, despite that, which is huge I just entered our next session is for December 13 at 5pm so that's in the system and. I think moving forward. Will just continue to work on building up her sense of self so that we can pull it out of that really dark space that is currently living in. and to you."
