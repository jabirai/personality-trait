14291.0,Patient,Hello.
298.0,Provider,How are you.
14291.0,Patient,I guess i'd say pretty meddling.
298.0,Provider,Are you sleeping.
14291.0,Patient,i'm. Closer to too much the not enough. yeah.
298.0,Provider,Now we had a plan last time we talked about going down on your meds um. Do you think that's still wise.
14291.0,Patient,"i'm not i'm not sure what the. meds are really doing and so i'm interested in switching to other meds but I don't know how soon are possible, that would be."
298.0,Provider,"Okay talk about what you are taking. Are you taking currently depakote the 250 milligrams one in the morning one at night. Yes, Okay, so now, you can take away the one in the morning. Okay, that will help with the hyper samia is the taking away one now the zyprexa. You can cut that are you cutting in half, yet."
14291.0,Patient,"No, there is a switch to a smaller hello, but I haven't heard in half."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, now it cut it in half and you'll be at 2.5 milligrams on the zyprexa the zyprexa at 2.5 milligrams helps with depression in a really good way without the side effects."
14291.0,Patient,OK. So.
298.0,Provider,My ideal idea is that will stop the depakote completely and we'll go to just the 2.5 milligrams of the zyprexa for a while and see what your symptoms are.
14291.0,Patient,"Okay, I was, I was hoping to. Ideally, have some sort of medicine that works on anxiety more directly."
298.0,Provider,"And we can. Definitely let's let's talk about anxiety right now that's a different medication completely than what you've got going on. So, as you have looked at your anxiety what's your triggers When does it happen, what are you feeling."
14291.0,Patient,"I mean i'm mostly just. Not. Mostly trying to avoid things that cause me anxiety which is making me have symptoms of being depressed but it's due to anxiety. But. Basically, right now, i'm just not. The my main focus are not doing things as opposed to doing things and now i'm just upset about not feeling up to doing things. So currently my main my main things i'm focusing on are. Not smoking cigarettes or vaporizing. not bothering my wife, while. she's at work. And not freaking out about things, and so. I guess I could just. Try to. Even things out and see where the anxiety starts coming from them, but. I definitely I definitely feel like, if I had less anxiety I would be less. Overly cautious and would be able to live a better fuller life but i'm currently just. Not even letting myself get close to anxiety because my. fits once I get there are so bad. um. But I haven't had. anxiety symptoms for so long because i've been tiptoeing around it. um. So yeah so I have to say I have depression symptoms but I don't think that's the issue and I don't have anxiety symptoms but I do think that's the issue."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14291.0,Patient,Is where.
298.0,Provider,"I think you're spot on, and I think one of the reasons you use cannabis i'm just guessing here is it does calm you down and if there's an underlying anxiety problem here now do I know the magic medication no I don't it's a trial and error, I know what safe to use. I know the starting places at where to find it. My suggestion is that you try something like propranolol and you can look it up a lot of people have had success with it, it doesn't alter it more the brain it calms the body down it lowers the heart rate it lowers the blood pressure and so your body is calm and so. it's not taken regularly it's only taking when you know that you're going to get up against something like you know that you have to go out and pull it together that's when that's when the medication is really what works well. i've had people who will say to me it's not you know I don't know if that'll be strong enough and it turns out, it is, but we don't know until we try."
14291.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,that's my thoughts. Just take it as needed it will lower your blood pressure so don't jump up and get dizzy and not know where that came from it doesn't happen to everybody.
14291.0,Patient,is something I buy over the counter Is this something you.
298.0,Provider,Know it's.
14291.0,Patient,it's okay.
298.0,Provider,"Great it's prescription and I want you to take the half a tablet and see if it takes away your anxiety if it doesn't you can take a whole tablet you can take it twice a day you could even take it more but we wouldn't do that, until we. even see if."
14291.0,Patient,Once a day works yeah I mean.
298.0,Provider,it's not that it's not addictive at all your body will crave it your brain won't crave it.
14291.0,Patient,"sounds great. yeah i'm currently at a place where I can. Stay mostly calm when i'm interacting with my wife or. Mental health experts, but anyone else, that if I interact with anyone else I just suddenly get super anxious and can function. And i'm currently unemployed and my wife would like me to be able to get a job. i'm close to that. So um so yeah i'm open i'm very open to cutting back on our on the math on the meds i'm currently taking but i'm even more interested in. ready yeah."
298.0,Provider,"And my suggestion is just keep working with me keep telling me your symptoms, you can always asking group to have a breakout room with me so that we can go over your meds and see if we need to add something. it's it's we can definitely get that underlying anxiety take. You know. work done."
14291.0,Patient,"crew Thank you and you have half pills, would be a good place to start with that."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, I do. It were and when we meet again. Tell me, if a whole pill is needed to control your anxiety. So i'm starting a half pill is 10 milligrams. You can take up to 40 milligrams so i'm thinking 20 milligrams. might do the job but we'll see every person responds differently all right take care of down. Any suicidal or homicidal thoughts."
14291.0,Patient,"No. No, not at all."
298.0,Provider,All right. Good take care.
14291.0,Patient,"Thank you, you too."
298.0,Provider,bye bye.
