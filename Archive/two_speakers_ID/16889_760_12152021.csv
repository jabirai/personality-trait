Sorry, to get super personal but that only happened, one that I remember know of, and I went to the police station and tried to press charges on about the statue of limitations were up. So they couldn't do anything about it, but they the police department has on. Recording him admitting to doing it and they still didn't do anything about it, like he didn't actually like you know physically touch me or anything like that, but still stone. yeah."
760.0,Provider,that's that's a seven year old yeah that's that's. that's probably that would have been really confusing and scary I would imagine. So yeah okay. All right. So how long after that incident did your father live in the House or before he and your mother divorced.
16889.0,Patient,"Now him oh my mom got a divorce, and we would go to his house every other weekend. Okay, so that's when it happened, and then I had told my mom about it and I had tried to commit suicide, when I was 13 or 14 when I told my mom about it and. They didn't make me go to a mental institution, because they released me back to them my mom so I didn't have to go to a mental institution."
760.0,Provider,Did you did you have to continue going to see your father every other weekend that's. Okay. nope okay did your father have a substance abuse problem that you know.
16889.0,Patient,No okay.
760.0,Provider,"All right, okay so currently you're struggling with. depression, anxiety."
16889.0,Patient,yeah and I have it yesterday.
760.0,Provider,"And you have ptsd to. Okay, so are you how would you rate that is it is it something that you struggle with like most of the time, or do you get or do you just have bad days and good days or how would you describe that. With those sent all three of those symptoms."
16889.0,Patient,"I mean, most of the time I have really bad days but it's more so of like I wake up and i'm pissed off at the world like i'm just angry all the. Time i'm never positive about. Anything I don't know which category that falls into but. I just have a hard time being happy I guess okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so. So you feel a little angry even now."
16889.0,Patient,um I mean not so angry right now but 96% of the time i'm pretty angry like i'm in a bad mood I don't really want to talk to nobody.
760.0,Provider,These sessions kind of hard for you Ashley.
16889.0,Patient,"i'm a little bit, but it's I mean it's hopefully it will help eventually so that's why I don't mind doing it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, thank you for your honesty I appreciate it telling me right off the BAT of things. Okay, so you're feeling angry, most of the time. So. You said you had a suicide attempt, do you have any current thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself."
16889.0,Patient,"or other no. No, not current but last. right before Christmas, last year I tried to commit suicide and ended up in a mental institution for. Three days."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you know what are some of the warning signs when your Depression and anxiety, or maybe features these symptoms are building to that kind of an unsafe unsafe level, do you know what is the trigger for that what what causes that when images moods."
16889.0,Patient,"um it's mainly just if, like. I don't know what made it, the last time was I got in a really bad argument with someone and. Like really, really bad."
760.0,Provider,Was it a friend or family member.
16889.0,Patient,It was boyfriend actually.
760.0,Provider,Your boyfriend okay. The one I mean.
16889.0,Patient,"yeah but we get I mean we haven't gotten an argument or whatever sense, and I mean, of course, every relationship, you know they're going to argue but um. But yeah it's nothing no nothing like that, though I just made a decision based off of off of an emotion."
760.0,Provider,"OK. OK, so the anger kind of takes you just the anger trigger depression would that be fair to say. And so, when you get intensely angry, you might feel irritable most of the time, but when you get really super super angry and you maybe read it as an eight or nine or 10 on the anger that spills over into other mental health. Sometimes, our emotions."
16889.0,Patient,"yeah and then I start thinking about like not having my son and. feeling worthless because i've you know, was a drug addict and have made bad choices. But I mean ever since the last suicide attempt honestly it hasn't gotten. That bad to where i've thought about hurting myself or anyone else okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, do you mind if I give you some feedback about substance abuse and ptsd."
16889.0,Patient,or go ahead.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, you you've described for me some pretty significant. traumatic events that you struggled with. ptsd causes the brain to kind of. it's kind of always in the state where you're kind of still the trauma may be long over but it's still the chemicals are still there it's kind of like you're still in it when you're not in it, and I think the symptoms of that the the overwhelming feelings of that people. are basically in like survival mode brand. it's hard long term to live in survival mode it's like nearly impossible, so people oftentimes turn to substances or other maladaptive kinds of coping behaviors. To deal with that correct and so it's. You know it's not your fault, what happened to you in childhood. Right it's not your fault and and you did the best you could in in a in a bad situation. So I would like to. Maybe in the next time or two, I do have some material, specifically, it is an evidence based treatment programs specifically for individuals with. ptsd and substance and or substance abuse in your case you have you have both, and so I think that would help you kind of process some of that right, and I think the anger, if you don't mind me saying, can I give you some feedback about the anger."
16889.0,Patient,yeah go ahead.
760.0,Provider,"This is probably a habit that came out of a learned way to defend yourself if I just get angry, I want to push everybody away, people will stay away from me and all the unsafe things that get done to me will just be over there and touch me."
16889.0,Patient,you're correct. So when that I feel.
760.0,Provider,"So when that becomes a habit you're doing that, like automatically just like you're you know it's a habit. And you know you maybe you don't need it anymore, because this you know you're no longer a kid you're out of that situation, but it's a habit now and so these these are some of the things that we can work through in therapy. Okay okay okay. All right, so as of right now, what are some of the internal coping strategies that you have to take your mind off of the intense symptoms when they're starting to build what do you do coping wise, other than."
16889.0,Patient,"um I usually go on a walk or like watch videos on my phone like tick tock videos. Okay, to try to get my mind off of it, or sometimes i'll just like count from like 100 backwards or from one to 100 or even higher if really if I have to just to you know, try to think about something else besides what's going on in my mind currently."
760.0,Provider,Did you teach yourself to do that actually.
16889.0,Patient,"No, I actually learned that yeah whenever I was in jail I got the lady that I talked to she gave me papers. on how to like distract your mind from other things."
760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's that's What would we call a grounding exercise it's. yeah it's designed what it's designed to do is let's let's say my. Depression is at an eight, and you know i'm struggling to deal with that because that's a painful thing to have your depression at an eight and so it's designed to kind of turn down the dial and maybe take it down to maybe a six or a five and give me some relief, you know we."
16889.0,Patient,don't really help them.
760.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so that's that it's not it's not something that's going to erase the pain, but. But it does help you cope, and you know we can do some additional things like that, as well okay that's really good so you're using that that's really great. Anything else that you do to close."
16889.0,Patient,um no not really.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and so where, what are the people or maybe the social settings that you can go to provide distraction when you're when your emotions are getting super painful like that."
16889.0,Patient,"i'm sorry, what do you mean by that."
760.0,Provider,Like where where can you go or what people can you hang out with when your when your depression is getting really big or your anxiety or ptsd is getting really big.
16889.0,Patient,um.
760.0,Provider,I mean have. People or.

16889.0,Patient,"Oh, I said just really my boyfriend I said i've been with him for over two years but i'm not as close to his family, as I am him, so I mean, in all honesty, he actually is. You know, really good whenever good to me whenever i'm going through stuff like he'll he's always there to listen and to try to give me advice, but he I mean he never puts me down or anything. But other than that really I don't have anybody because I really don't have any friends, I just don't trust anybody."

16889.0,Patient,I just like to listen to music and go on walks or and hanging out with my boyfriend really good I like to make bracelets and stuff with yarn.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, oh that's a good grounding kind of an activity to kind of keeps you busy, and then gives you something to do, and then you can kind of keep keep it or perhaps give it away that's good."
16889.0,Patient,"Okay, I really liked wanna."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so talk to me about your health habits your sleep eating and exercise."
16889.0,Patient,"I don't exercise besides going little walks here and there, but um I mean I eat fine and I wasn't sleeping good until. Even told me those."
760.0,Provider,Okay now now you're doing better with that.
16889.0,Patient,Okay cool yes yep.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you have any health problems like physical health problems. No, no okay. Okay um. Alright, so we have a little bit of time we could keep going because i've come to the end of my questions, but we could kind of switch over and. i'd like to hear from you, because the other step that I that we I like to do is work with you to develop a treatment plan which is going to be something for us to focus our sessions. But the main thing about the treatment plan Ashley is the treatment plan, even though it's something that you and I are going to work on together it's your treatment plan because it's your life and it's your goals and and i'm i'm the type of person who likes to make a lot of suggestions. But. If I ever make a suggestion that you feel resistant to or you don't like or you feel uncomfortable or you know that's not going to work for me i'm going to ask that you. state that, because at the end of the day, it's your treatment plan it's not my treatment plan so I kind of want to preface that and, with that in mind. You already said, the very beginning of the session that once your son bass, is there, you know, is there a legal avenue for that to get your son back."
16889.0,Patient,"And the cases actually closed. Income but they said that I can see my son my son's grandma she said, I can see him whenever I have. A long period of time, of being clean in several clean drug drug screens."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how. How does she want you to prove that to her."
16889.0,Patient,"Either a printed out drug screen or I mean some you know just as long as it's from like a not something that I just would write out, you know it doesn't have to be actual paper from you know the doctor or the lab or anything like that."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and so I know we require drug screens, have you done your drug screens with us."
16889.0,Patient,"I go to do my labs tomorrow at two. Okay, my labs in my urine your analysis so i'm hoping that whenever that comes you know the doctor gets it or whatever, that they can maybe email me a copy of it or or something. Okay, and then I know they send them wants to do the home drug screens I don't know. i'm sure it's such as my you know me i'm sure that they'll give me a copy or something of them, stating that."
760.0,Provider,Okay well there's a way around that even if if you know you I think signing a release of information there there's a department that handles that and you just signed a release of information and. And you can have the access to that because that's for legitimate purpose but I guess the other question that I have Ashley have you asked. Your your son's from other how long how many what period of time is enough for you to prove that i've been clean.
16889.0,Patient,"That I have not asked her, but I mean if I messaged her show messaged me back."
760.0,Provider,Because I said I just usually text or or I can call her.
16889.0,Patient,"But I mean i've never really been serious about you know getting clean, until now, because you know I went to a detox I was only there for a couple days it's kind of like I went to rehab whatever for to make other people happy. And they you know I just wasn't ready, so I didn't stick to. It you know you can't be forced into something that deep down inside that you have to want yourself and I. have learned that. it's the how I will. Now i'm to a point where I just i'm tired being you know started being sick. Tired or not having a job tired of not having anything having to depend on other people for things you know, like because I smoke cigarettes, so you know I can't depend on i'm 30 years old, I can't depend on everybody else for the rest of my life."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so you said getting your son back he's like I imagine that might be at the top of your list. And how long have you when did you get admitted to break our House, do you know the date more or less."
16889.0,Patient,"Why called the beginning of November, but I didn't get my appointment until November 22."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's when you went through like the intake process, yes okay all right, well, I could I don't really know your son's grandmother. But I would suggest that perhaps you could. text her or call her and just just say hey I want to give you an update. I started in this program. And you know the other thing you can get as you can get a letter of participation and you know the letter would say things like the weekly the weekly group sessions, that you have you started attending a week with the group sessions."
16889.0,Patient,yeah i've been to several of them.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that is to say your individual your counseling sessions that you're going through as well. And you can just say hey I want to let you know that you know i'm not asking you anything, yet I mean this is this is how I will do it. i'm not asking anything yet, but I do want to let you know. i've been clean for such and such a day. And that being said, there are recovery. Apps for your phone, for your cell phone. yeah and perhaps you could. download one of those and start accounts. Okay, that would be helpful to your recovery. And you can say i've been clean for so many days just be truthful to her and authentic. And I just want to give you an update and can you can you give and maybe ask her for an update has my son doing kind of thing."
16889.0,Patient,know. and send them participation letter or whatever it was you said how would I go about that.
760.0,Provider,"Just you just have to there's a department that gives you those things. Again, I would have to sign a release of information. And, and they would email it to you so, then you would have a letter to provide. Better okay."
16889.0,Patient,"That would help a lot, I think."
760.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think just kind of opening the doorway to communication and we've got the holidays right upon us right about now. And so it would be a good time to just reach out and just say hey I want to know this and. You know if you're not all over her asking her asking her just kind of. letting right no and then maybe on the next conversation, you can casually asked her what do you need for to feel good about me seeing my son kinds of questions, what can I do and kind of go from there."
16889.0,Patient,"yeah I think your way is you know the way you suggested, I think, is really good because. she's the type of person she's not mean or anything but she's the type of person that if I asked you know too much at once. she's probably going to think not that i'm lying about it, but you know, of course, I have said before, that I was. clean and I was only clean, for you know, a couple days, and then you know, I think it really helped you know what the admissions letter in. You know the drug screening results and stuff like that, and just give it a week or so and then just say you know when not asked her right away, if I can see him just you know. Like you said just suddenly you know."
760.0,Provider,"open a dialogue with. is always to me from the way you're communicating about her well not obvious but I suspect that she's. taking good care of your son. So shoulders about. she loves him, and she cares about him she's she's doing her best to take care of him."
16889.0,Patient,yeah so there's no doubt in my mind that he's been he's been well taken care of.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's a huge blessing on on you, that is, if it were something different, that would be a whole nother level as a mind. Exactly So if you just kind of open a dialogue of communication with her. It kind of helps you build. A better relationship with her and she's not then she she may start to start to contemplate what can actually do so that i'll let her come and visit and and what is Where do they live, what is your son and his grandmother live."
16889.0,Patient,"Today they always. yeah real close they live in the next town over from me, I live in Dover, they live in new philly, which is only about 10 minutes away from here so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's very doable then."
16889.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so if we're working on your treatment plan one way would be to build a good relationship and. Prove that that you know that you're. That you're ready for that and I and. You talked about you want to be continued to be clean right correct is that something."
16889.0,Patient,"Yes, and to get a job."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Those are all good things if. Once you do that. Then that's that's something when a person is stuck in their addiction. They can't do those things. And so, she sees you can you can save the paycheck stubs or I guess nowadays probably you get an electronic paycheck stuff you can like save them to a file, you can show you know i'm working prove it to her and and build a build a case correct okay. So any other. goals you want you have that you want to work on."
16889.0,Patient,I mean. To start treating people better.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, this. guy's dealing with the anger."
16889.0,Patient,"yeah I was gonna try anger management wants but, and then a couple people told me that it doesn't work, so I kind of steered away from it, but I mean I don't know if that's what I need but."
760.0,Provider,"Well, seeking safety. is right here is this book I love this book it's awesome there is a section in here about anger. Okay, and there's a whole bunch of materials that we can work on with anger cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive behavioral therapy is a fancy way for saying how we think affects our emotions, which affects our behavior. yeah so we can we can work on those things together. And I think. I think getting at the root of. The trauma a little bit and maybe you know, working on those areas. building trust, but you know, the thing I really like about seeking safety Ashley is like the number one thing, it always starts with and it always ends with as well, is the number one thing is to keep your safe so. Recovery does not mean I open the door to unsafe people even even if i'm you know there's lots of people in the world that don't deserve trust. And you know it's a kind of a balance, you don't want to be the type of person that absolutely will never trust, nobody. Right, but you don't want to be the opposite type of person that just opens and leads with an open heart and just like. where's their heart on their sleeve and allows themselves to be abused either so it's about a middle ground and and an understanding that you've you've learned a lack of trust, because. That was something you need to learn to."
16889.0,Patient,survive right.
760.0,Provider,"Before and so now. But now, this lack of trust to a point, you know you want to make people earn your trust, but."
16889.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"You know, setting proper boundaries and things like that is important. And so today. i'm hearing trust just through our conversation I hear that you trust your son's grandmother, I hear that you trust your grandmother, and you have some level of trust for his parents. or his family."
16889.0,Patient,Your boyfriend boyfriend's family yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's not any small amount of trust for somebody who struggled with all that trump. Right, so you have it in you, but it's I think it's useful to be cautious you're not just rushing in but also not shutting the door and not allowing people the opportunity to prove that they're trustworthy."
16889.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I used to trust anybody like I would have a conversation with like somebody that I met that like a new person and I just start telling my whole life story. And then that turned on me pretty quick they always want to hold you know, everybody else my business or went back and told my family things so."
760.0,Provider,it's learning when is this in childhood that you did that or.
16889.0,Patient,No as an adult.
760.0,Provider,"As an adult okay. That when you were under the influence. Okay alright, so perhaps you want to work on dealing with triggers and learn how to stay clean and sober yes. Have you ever been to 12 step meetings."
16889.0,Patient,"I went to some like once or twice, but other than that no this was several years ago."
760.0,Provider,"And where you are required to go to those or did you just kind of go, because you wanted to quit."
16889.0,Patient,"Oh, I went because I wanted to."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and what was your opinion of it, how was or What was your experience of it."
16889.0,Patient,"um I actually really liked it because it was you know meeting people that. did some of the same things that I did, because you know, whenever you do something, while you're you know, under the influence or whatnot you feel like. No one else has done anything like that, and you feel guilty about it, but then there's other people that you meet that have done the similar things and it makes you feel like you're not alone."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, yes okay well, would you be willing to go to 12 step meetings. yeah Okay, I think that would be really good."
16889.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"I think, so I think you. And is the 12 step meetings is a process, I would also strongly encourage that you. kind of acclimate to the meetings. cautiously look for people who are trustworthy because you know you're going to have a mixed group i'm not gonna sit here and tell you that everybody's going to close that meetings for the right reason because."
16889.0,Patient,I know I know I know that yep.
760.0,Provider,"But at the same time, there are a if it's a halfway decent meeting there's got to be at least a few people in the meeting that are there for the right reason and when they speak, you should be able to identify who they are. Right okay so. Go to those individuals and start building what I would call a positive support system. Somebody that. You could call to. help you let's say you you're having a bad day and you just feel like picking up. Then, that would be somebody that you could call. plus the the act of working those 12 steps is is so keeling. and read. But if that's like a long term process. Correct so I just would suggest that would you be willing to do that before that we met the next time to go to at least a couple of meetings. yeah Okay, I think that would be good."
16889.0,Patient,"yeah I don't I don't drive, though, so if I were only to make it, I mean I don't know how often we would see each other but."
760.0,Provider,I think you and I are going to be meeting every other week.
16889.0,Patient,"Okay, so there might be a chance, I might be able to go only go to one or two of them only because I don't drive and I don't know how far they would be to walk but."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, do you need me to look for meetings in your area, because I am not in Ohio."
16889.0,Patient,But I Maybe you can do that for me i'd really appreciate that.
760.0,Provider,I will reach out to the referral department and have them email you with that.
16889.0,Patient,yeah that'd be good.
760.0,Provider,"Or let me see. I know, with the pandemic, a lot of places we're doing zoom meetings. um Okay, I do think it's good to go to the meeting in person, if you can, but you want to supplement with zoom that would be."
16889.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I could do both of them because, like I said I don't drive, so I could go to a meeting and then, if I can't find a ride, then I can just do one on a zoom call or whatnot I think that'd be really good."
760.0,Provider,"yeah that would that would be really good yeah and just kind of let me know your experience on that. Okay okay. Okay, that sounds great alright, so I think, do you have any other questions or any other concerns. Now that you want to discuss. No. I think we have some good direction on where to go."
16889.0,Patient,"I think, so too i'm feeling pretty positive about it so that's good."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right Ashley. well. i've worked in this field for many years, and I do want to say i've seen. A lot of women struggle with what you're going through with your son and i've seen them get their kids back and actually not just women when men and women losing their kids. And i've seen them get their kids."
16889.0,Patient,Back yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And and go through a process of recovery and healing it's possible so I. kind of want to leave that to you. I do want to kind of caution, you with that word normal I really hate. That word normal. yeah. I don't know if it's such a it seems like it's something that a person said things to themselves when maybe they're being hard on themselves right and the thing about being a person in recovery which which you're you're starting on this journey now, which is you know great. But a person who maintains a recovery and survives all the things that you survived and so much more than normal."
16889.0,Patient,"Right, no, you are that's a great way to look at it, because I feel sometimes you know, like, I just want to be a normal person like I told you, the beginning, I just want to live like a normal adult, but I am a strong person Oh, because i've made it this far."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, Sir that's what i'm saying you survived a lot is just."
16889.0,Patient,You know.
760.0,Provider,"You just need a little bit of guidance to help room manage the depression, the anxiety, the symptoms of ptsd. Then also working to change the negative thinking that's developed with all of that. yeah because when we think negative thoughts we're going to feel negative things and then, when we do that we make these horrible choices. And if this. Like spiral, and it just goes and goes and goes and both so. Part of the healing process is going to be to kind of erase that programming as much as we can, and then develop new programming that's positive. Right and you you've already kind of you know off to a good start so just goes to me, I wanted to just kind of you're going to be better than normal you're not going to be normal but, but you can be better than normal and and boys."
16889.0,Patient,Have right.
760.0,Provider,"it's a good time to get a good job. As a full time job right now so. Yes, do you need referrals with. resume hell or things like that is that something you would need as well."
16889.0,Patient,yeah actually I would okay.
760.0,Provider,All right. Maybe. Okay. Then i'll.
16889.0,Patient,Get emails about those.
760.0,Provider,"you'll get an email it won't be for me to get emails. Now, are we set up for our next meeting. Now, do you know how to contact virtual clinic. Yes, Okay, can you do that as soon as we get off."
16889.0,Patient,yeah I can do that.
760.0,Provider,"And schedule it for maybe two weeks from today. Sure okay all right let's do that or, if you want to take set up a couple sessions, you can do that as well. Oh yeah I didn't know anything about it."
16889.0,Patient,yeah that's good.
