14934.0,Patient,January 1 19.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Have you ever been on suboxone before. Oh Okay, so we can be a tad bit tricky to get on, especially if you're using it, since you've been using fentanyl fentanyl gets into your fat and it leaks out over four days. I don't normally say this, but we don't have a lot of people who come and tell me that they're on fentanyl. i'm gonna put you on something called sub you tech and."
14934.0,Patient,"Like. I was trying to do this, cold Turkey, and this is my second second day during and I just kind of do is I came in yesterday and and they only come today so."
298.0,Provider,Good so you haven't used.
14934.0,Patient,I haven't used in three days.
298.0,Provider,"that's wonderful so it's gonna be so much easier for you to get on to this medicine, where do you want me to send it. Was the walgreens on broadway."
14934.0,Patient,The CVs on myrtle.
298.0,Provider,"Okay okay i'll do that and so. You put we put one you even can do just half a tablet put it under your tongue and let it completely dissolve. It doesn't really work in your stomach So if you can hold the tablet in your mouth for up to 15 minutes, even better, because that's where all the medicine is absorbed through so um. i'll give you three tablets a day, but you might the first day you might want to do half tablets and and. What."
14934.0,Patient,"I said yeah i'm not i'm not i'm trying to like cut back as much as possible, I don't like a bunch but."
298.0,Provider,"Well, what I want to do is get you enough so that you're not craving and get you enough so that you don't get into withdrawals, we can cut back definitely. it's up if you only want to a day i'll give you only two what's up to you."
14934.0,Patient,"I have a question, so how long until like the. So what let's say I cut tablet in half. And I still feel sick right doing another like what like three hours later."
298.0,Provider,"If you if you start to get stuck you're just it's putting you into what's called precipitated withdrawals and there's no reversing that so you might as well take what you have and continue on the path, but you've done good by not having it in your system right now."
14934.0,Patient,"Yes, just like the worst is. How long you know, and so, like, I will start feeling this way without taking suboxone."
298.0,Provider,"Are you asking me how long are you gonna keep going through withdrawals. You could keep going trawls a good week. it's possible taking the sub D checks that i'm going to give you. It will start once your body crosses over to this opioid type on it's a partial agonist on the brain you're going to get some relief, but it's that crossing over that can be hard."
14934.0,Patient,"So. So if, like after. A day I would be on suboxone not."
298.0,Provider,"Next week. Next week, when I see you, on Thursday, I will give you suboxone. Okay, which uh but just to get you started i'm going to give you some new techniques to hopefully make it easier on yourself."
14934.0,Patient,"Okay right, thank you, I appreciate it."
298.0,Provider,"And I wish you the best of luck. it's it's hard, but you can do it it'll feel it may feel bad, but you'll get better."
14934.0,Patient,yeah no i'm. Like gone so.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, good what's motivating you."
14934.0,Patient,"i'm just a person like this, like you know I don't call my family my like my mom loves me to death and I barely ever color like my sisters love me to death and I don't ever call them."
298.0,Provider,Sorry.
