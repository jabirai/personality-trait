105.0,Provider,delete this one. what's going on. What kind of sick.
11339.0,Patient,"or no. So. We went to me my boyfriend went to a concert on Monday. And there's a lot of people there and then like a few days later, I started feeling sick like really sick and like I don't have any taste or smell. So I did a covert test i'm waiting to hear for the results."
105.0,Provider,"yeah so is that typical of you, when you get a cold to lose your your sense of taste and smell."
11339.0,Patient,"Oh, and I also I haven't gotten sick so and so long and it's just sucks. Like hit me up out of nowhere like a bad breaks."
105.0,Provider,And were you someone who. Was vaccinated or no.
11339.0,Patient,"I just had my first box vaccination, so I haven't gotten there yet."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, I see okay. Well, when are the results coming in."
11339.0,Patient,"Like 24 hours, I said to you yesterday after hours and then it's like this. I have to do COPA testing for work, so they make me spit into like this little vial and then they do the COPA test that way so that's what I did I sent it yesterday and they're supposed to get the results within like 24 to 48 hours so i'm just kind of anxious to see what that is."
105.0,Provider,"Imagine, I mean. What are your thoughts I don't know what your beliefs are about this, or if you what information you've got rattling around in there."
11339.0,Patient,"Like about cool good. love. It love it, I thought it was going to be a lot worse than this. Like i'm definitely sick, but I just thought it was like the level that people other people have described, I decided to be a lot difference. So I feel grateful that I guess it's not as bad as some people have experienced. I don't know i'm just all about like the human decency, so I was down to like get. The shot and everything i'm just kind of mad at myself that I didn't wear a mask I didn't even think about it, by shoehorn a mouse, and it was just so crazy, it was just like a bunch of young people not caring. And then, like it what you guys thought so bad we're like just trying to make it through security and people are like pushing through security, where they like when even, let us into. The concert there for a little bit, so it was just crazy and like back about on that i'm like oh my God I can't believe I was so close to that many right strange to so many strangers, but I don't know. It almost felt like. We were invincible because, like I had traveled, I would like had been to Las Vegas i've been to La you know and different little things and I hadn't gotten sick like on word but yep Sure enough, the hometown albuquerque going to a concert. i've gotten something. yeah so."
105.0,Provider,"it's it's it's a difficult for everyone to strike a balance between wanting to have some quality of life and then like you said, maybe caring about the larger Community so."
11339.0,Patient,"yeah exactly, so I think that we're ready for that, but. I don't know it's hard it's we're not like completely out of the water yet."
105.0,Provider,"So, in the meantime, are you being. kind of quarantining in a sense, so you just in case."
11339.0,Patient,Have a body.
105.0,Provider,How have you been getting along with your boyfriend and we met one time to sort of explore some communication just check in and see how you guys are doing.
11339.0,Patient,"And we're doing good you like, oh no he's just like so sensitive, sometimes it feels like so sensitive and then. i've kind of like I don't know if it's how do I describe it. As like if i'm more giving more boundaries or I like a more assertive and what i'm saying and i'm like no I don't like that or i'm just like using my voice and speaking up and then he kind of like it's almost like he, like doesn't like that and I. Remember you've kind of seen something I think it was if it was I don't remember if it was group or if it was one on one video like once you kind of start. Establishing those boundaries that kind of like push us some people away and I in a way, I kind of feel like we're in that we're kind of in that, right now, because for so many times I compromise or I just kind of. didn't really say anything and so now i'm like no I don't like that or I speak up. Like i'm trying to find an example and I. And well i'll try to find you an example, but yeah just like different little things like that, and then he's like i'm. You don't listen he loves to say like I don't listen and then like his favorite thing is like. i'm. Well i'm just done i'm just done and i'm like Okay, well then just be done, I like that's like your favorite team to say say something else. So I don't know it just kind of seems like some characteristics that like keep on. That he keeps going around in circles. But then i'm kind of like I want a little bit more like I don't know that just seems very childish to me it's starting to become very like apparent that's like kind of childish."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I get I think I get what you mean by childish meaning you maybe have an opinion that i'm a tour communication are these skills that you're you're you. You know, like assertive communication. setting boundaries and things like that. yeah okay."
11339.0,Patient,"And then, like I forgot I think we're watching something and. i'm working on the weekend, because I know it's just like flux my memory so bad, I really suck at memory remembering stuff i've been doing a little bit better. i'm looking before 12. Also, like he's out of unemployment, I don't have any money coming through like we don't even have any money for smoke so like right now we're not smoking because they're like you just can't afford it. So we're kind of going through that I know it's going to be stressful because he just got his driver's license and. I think I told you that he lost everything so he just got his driver's license is going to apply for Amazon, but I mean it's what the 28th run to do in like two days, five days with the grace period and. I don't really think he has much money so that's great um and then so he's like stressed out about that, which I get these were both kind of stressed out about money. And then. Was I gonna say. We are watching something like on the movie I like on the on TV and it's just like some I think it was like I don't remember what the exact like situation was, but it was like. The person will is. Remember i'll come back to it i'll come back to if I can remember, I just kind of want to give you a better example of like kind of how he perceives things. Okay, look around. I just. My thoughts are failing me right now."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and it would have been in the category of immature."
11339.0,Patient,or just kind of judgmental.
105.0,Provider,Oh no.
11339.0,Patient,"Oh yeah oh Oh, this is what it was okay so we're watching a documentary. about her, and one of the people when they're raiders or whatever he feels like I hit my rock bottom when I had to I was in college and I had to dumpster dive and get food whatever blah blah blah and then he, like. retorts like well that's not rock bottom rock bottom is, if you don't have a car you don't have this and i'm like who are you to sit criticize what someone else's rock bottom it's. Like you know what I mean that's open to perception I don't know I just think that's and he does little things like that, where someone says something about this being bad he's like no, it could be worse or it could be better i'm like who are you to like just credit someone like that. And like that so that's that to me to at times and it's just kind of annoying I don't know where he picked that up, but that should is so fucking annoying."
105.0,Provider,"yeah it does sound like it it's doing something specific to you cuz. His perceptions i'm wondering if you're maybe taking what he's talking about someone else something else, and maybe directing it to you."
11339.0,Patient,Maybe.
105.0,Provider,"How, how do you see yourself, these days, what is your your opinion of yourself."
11339.0,Patient,"I mean. I feel like I. Am like powder myself and how far i've become and I feel like I definitely have come a far away, I feel like I do still have some shortcomings that I want to. learn about and overcome but I mean overall I don't have any negative like feelings towards myself right now I feel pretty good about where i'm."
105.0,Provider,"Okay excellent So what is it it just imagine that it's in. Well, let me ask you instead when you see him being judgmental and discrediting what you have a pretty big reaction what is that emotion that you have what is that."
11339.0,Patient,"I guess like judgmental like I don't know i'm just like. It makes me angry. And I guess maybe because i'm a very like empathetic person too so like i'm always like trying to see the good in people and, like he kind of is the opposite he's always like people are going to like screw you over you know any mean. And so. I don't know I think I just had to get bugged because i'm always like looking for. For the good and something and I feel like he's always just kind of like trying to find the bad in something so it gets under my skin. yeah. i'm for two hours a day. Okay, can you take the dogs. Thank you. I guess we'll see. About. Still. You still got I guess you just come on."
105.0,Provider,"So, if this way of being which My guess is he's been this way, this is just this way right it's not like he just changed. yeah okay. Well, if it wasn't. I know you mentioned that that it makes you angry. underneath that. There might be something being threatened so just imagine that it carried on and on and on, and it was like that more often more intensely and it was this judgmental discrediting way for a longer duration and maybe even more intensely what's what's the concern that might happen."
11339.0,Patient,Like the lack of understanding.
105.0,Provider,"And then, what would happen because I don't know what he would be not understanding."
11339.0,Patient,"I mean. I guess kind of when i'm thinking about it like that. I guess he kind of like kind of routes back to me just being a little sensitive, you know may be like wanting to share those vulnerable pieces. But feeling like there would it really be like me up sympathy."
105.0,Provider,"yeah there's no so no room for your vulnerability, because he has no understanding. yeah so right, even though we started with it looks like it's about these other people these other things, but you. Get kind of up in arms about it in the sense as well, what what's what the heck who are you to but really when it when we look at it a little closer, it might be well if this man is doing this with these people, maybe he's not safe to hear when I talk about my rock bottom or my perceptions."
11339.0,Patient,"Oh, what the heck."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, that happens all day long to me. Okay. So now, if this is true if that's what's going on here. It means. That somewhere to talk. i've been nobody's good nobody's bad you get to say. In a sense, own what happened. So you know I noticed I just got irrationally angry, or I know I just popped off for some reason I wanted, I want to talk about what I think happen, you know kind of going into. i'm thinking, maybe if you're judging them by some standards, you have for yourself, maybe you might apply that same approach to me and be judging me based on your standard and. I will it's scary because maybe you'll judge me yeah yeah. and He has some of that inside of him too. he's got it he's got a an inner critic there's there's there's a place that I imagine he's going to be able to relate to you on that level."
11339.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,And are you aware of where that is where he doesn't he doesn't. Like to be criticized around a particular area of his life.
11339.0,Patient,mmm. hmm. yeah. Oh yeah.
105.0,Provider,So what is that do you happen to know that.
11339.0,Patient,"i'm so like he knows that he needs to get like a car and a job and get his phone back on, and so, when I talk about like that kind of stuff or anyone does he just gets very defensive because he's like I already know that I know what I need to do, I don't need anyone else telling me."
105.0,Provider,So what you are you ever curious about what his opinion of himself is.
11339.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,Do you talk about it.
11339.0,Patient,I don't know how to.
105.0,Provider,"Oh okay. Well, they can be simple questions like. When you think about not having a job, not having a car. What is your opinion of you to have an opinion of you and that's a very direct kind of question sometimes will say. Is your sense of self esteem affected by it, or do you know. Do you know what you think about you, you do know that your opinion of yourself changes when. Employment changes car when things change to kind of already have that awareness. What do you what's your self talk, when you say to yourself, honey, you know because. That gets into some self awareness and I don't know to what degree. But what have you liked when me that maybe i've asked you what your beliefs about yourself, as you may have seen it in group, a lot of times, no focus on belief, a lot about like a core belief, especially over the last month or two."
11339.0,Patient,"um. let's see. I like to see how it would be how to say it like. Not like structured because i'm just thinking about like. Like when we think I guys with like the core beliefs. And then it's like you kind of had to I don't remember like the deep the details are like the questions um, but it was kind of like if I believe that."
105.0,Provider,"If this is true what is this about me that's the vehicle the machine the tool it's the hammer of the project of getting to the core belief is that question. If that's true so he would be doing this, he would be doing well if that's true. I already know that about myself and I keep hearing this from other people I don't have a job, what is, what does that what does that say about me. You would have to answer that mean that would have to be something you would do coming at it from this angle, the way I do. You probably would get a lot of defensiveness and confusion from your partner, because I have a way of explaining it that makes it possible for people to I just completely help them get it done. Whereas if you don't know how to do it really sometimes for people, the way to to start is to say, their own so they say things like. You know, when I heard us, you know we were in this documentary and she was dumped trust dumpster diving and you were grading it in some way as not rock bottom based on your definition of rock bottom your life experience for to take that strong opinion you have sweetheart and I imagined. You applying it to me. And then you could go through those steps if you wanted to you could say, and I learned this technique from when and which is to try and figure out what belief system was operating and what I think about myself. And I and you could do it in front of him, in a sense, like, how can this is true, if this is true, the meaning that it makes, I say to myself, is this that's one way or you could say. I just feel scared that you won't accept me I see you judging and grading other people, what is the standard of okay enos and i'm afraid i'm not okay in your eyes that's an very oversimplified. expedient way to get to the same result. It gets rid of all those words and all the processes and it just gets right to now I don't know if that happens to be true for you katie but. If it's anything like that we could start by sharing and then you might say. and ask right be curious because this isn't an argument about being right and being able to say so, when you watch that show what's it like for you to see someone that is saying it's their rock bottom, but you don't agree, I mean really wanting to understand his perspective."
11339.0,Patient,"Okay, that makes sense I don't think I really have done that."
105.0,Provider,"Because probably N, is for most people, but what we just described we're arming up we're saying this person is dangerous, I can't be vulnerable they don't accept difference in others they won't accept mine."
11339.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,And he doesn't he doesn't welcome feedback from other people around his difference either he pushes it away. When you know anyone says anything about job or worker or something like that he. doesn't want to hear it. So. He may have some. He may really actually have a strong opinion about himself that he just doesn't want to hear one more whisper about from anyone else he may actually be having a running tape going on inside his head.
11339.0,Patient,I think so.
105.0,Provider,"isn't that why we get defensive, because if we don't have that you can say whatever you want to do if we know we're okay with who we are, then we can tolerate hearing someone kind of even make fun of it. Like yeah I know it's good job i'll shit you know i'm out there every day doing this success situation just bite so a very different response than I already know I don't need to be told right. I can take it in because I know i'm still a good person self talk that I have the belief about myself as i'm still lovable good person and it's not whether I have a job or a car, do you want to take a second and cough along with it OK."
11339.0,Patient,yeah it's OK it's like I feel comfortable like this.
105.0,Provider,"yeah I mean we're talking a little bit about how the relationship is going, something that you're seeing kind of starting with. This word like a child, maybe this word that captures in mature, but if we take that labeling away, you yourself i'm imagining don't like judgment and labeling has a very negative impact. yeah if we instead of labeling and with those words instead we just go to I don't like it. The differences I just don't like it, because so you're sitting there and you're watching the show. You just got defensive. How enjoyable how much do you want to sit and watch the rest of that documentary Madam. So really it's about I don't like right in mind it's he's not good it's not bad, both of you are doing particular things because they're adaptive in some way. But you don't like it you just got cut off your sense of connection and intimacy just got cut off. You can say that. A new who wants to hang out again we don't because it might pop up again so it's really about that, so the intention is, you know it's not about judging someone is childish room mature it's about. I feel disconnected from you when I hear you judging something on TV. You see it. I feel disconnected all the sudden all this defensiveness comes up in me like you might be judging me the same way, judging them on the TV. Do you judge me that way, do you judge yourself that way. We can start to turn towards asking questions what labels do is we're done. we're done yeah the conversations over the connection is over, we have a label for it we're done."
11339.0,Patient,"And I think that's just what I did too, because I kinda. In the same way I just kind of labeled it and then shut off. yeah not upset."
105.0,Provider,"Let me take a look. yeah I understand take care of yourself i'm going to open up a note here take I hadn't done that beforehand, when I look in. Your. I can update here."
11339.0,Patient,"yeah i'm supposed to be worth you know if I can finish the rest of the day, I really don't feel good."
105.0,Provider,"that's crummy. You mentioned something about weed I didn't write it down, I think you said you are waiting until afternoon most days."
11339.0,Patient,"afternoon, yes."
105.0,Provider,How many days in the week are you doing that.
11339.0,Patient,Five five to six.
105.0,Provider,"You also said, there was a constraint, was it just the tobacco cigarettes or of the of marijuana."
11339.0,Patient,marijuana because of money. yeah don't smoke cigarettes okay.
105.0,Provider,yeah i'm not sure who does. Not. And I in group you've been talking with Dr Solomon about trying to find a dose that's not making you tired.
11339.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"I noticed that you didn't share. The timing of it, and I was curious about your decision not to as in taking it in the morning versus twice a day that kind of thing."
11339.0,Patient,Oh. I don't know why I didn't share that.
105.0,Provider,"I don't I just would prefer to I am not going to answer that question. Let me figure out a way to answer you without that I don't tell people what they should do. that's my general approach i've been doing this for 2223 years, so it I know it seems like a really silly little difference. I think it's interesting that there was this exploration, you and I had about it about Oh, the dose might be too much if it were taken all at once. got into the bloodstream stayed there all day what is that right amount, so what I was wondering is if you've been given some thought or to what that might mean, as far as the actual amount taken in a single day if it was taken once a day."
11339.0,Patient,"Yes, maybe I just didn't mention it because I didn't really know how to articulate it, but it could definitely be something that is I should bring up because. I take the half the other half the pulse strip the morning, you know at the i've been trying to take the other half together, but sometimes like it's just too much, so I can definitely kind of bowl over that and see what the difference is there and tell."
105.0,Provider,"yeah I think. you're the story that you're describing. No one else is describing it is unique and I think it is deserving of attention. In other words, most clients, certainly, by the time that you've been in this program have an awareness of their new normal, in other words they're not overmedicating which means they're they're tired and drowsy that means you got too much. or they are having withdrawal symptoms of sneezing runny nose, maybe hot cold sweats know they're experiencing those 123 levels of withdrawal and so it's not quite at that that optimal level. I would say, nine out of 10 of my clients on my caseload take it once a day set time typically it's in the morning and it's lasting 24 hours. yeah and you are not taking it that way, so you are a little unique i'm not saying you're the only person. But the piece that's unique to you is that you still don't have your new normal you still don't have have it figured out yet and that's that's unique."
11339.0,Patient,"I mean it's just the fact that the. it's too much a we had been too much so, whenever I do the. strip in half the strip I feel like so studied in and out of it that's, the only way for me to combat it was to do like the. ship in the morning and then do the remainder of it that's. In the afternoon, but I understand what you're seeing how that is like different than the norm."
105.0,Provider,"yeah, so this is tricky for me there's another element to this, which is because I work with two different physicians and they do their tapering differently."
11339.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"The administer the medication differently. And it's outside of my lane so Dr Solomon is going to approach it. To the degree that he's comfortable with the to the comfort and his experience with it. But I can tell you, most of my clients take it once a day and it's quite a bit, it would be less than what you're taking because it's too much it's too much for you even cutting it into portions. So you're it would go down significantly, but the difference would be you'd be taking less throughout you'd be taking less, but a whole lot more once a day. You see it you'd find that in that amount that works that stays on those opiate receptors all day you get it. The right blood level for the day versus you continuing to engage in what we would see as addictive behavior, which is still trying to treat it on your own, whereas when we just take it once a day. we're no longer reaching for something oh my energies down Oh, I need to do something and that's a problem is that we're you know that that's the key piece from from the therapist perspective i'm wanting to get rid of that part yeah."
11339.0,Patient,yeah I remember you saying that.
105.0,Provider,yeah so. it's it's interesting um.
11339.0,Patient,"I think if I could take her down to just the one or i've been talked to him. It seems like that is like the best thing I don't really think I need, like the other. i'm just gonna follow with what he says. i've been taking my medicine today because I feel really sick and I haven't really been able to eat anything so when I do i'm just going to take my strip and a half. at once."
105.0,Provider,"yeah but I don't know that because i've been listening to you too it's I I don't feel confident that both of you are saying that you're on the same page. I know you're taking him at a different time I am really hearing that it has a sedated effect, I just don't know that he really heard it."
11339.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,so good.
11339.0,Patient,be emphasized more.
105.0,Provider,"It would be good for your physician to know what's going on, because I can't I can't make medical recommendations I can't make those medication prescription recommendations I can't do that. You know that has to come from him I can talk about things i've seen I and the successes that i've seen."
11339.0,Patient,"So there's going to be an EVO when we have the. We have been flagged I can just say something to the extent of when I take the medicine all at once it's too much, and so what i've been doing to combat. The like undesired effects is i've been taking taking the strip like one strip in the morning and then. waiting on taking the other half and i'm just concerned that that is like acting in an addictive behavior and I want to make sure that i'm fighting like the right dose How does that sound."
105.0,Provider,"it's awfully awfully good um and there's a little bit of dynamics, I think, going on with the physician, and I, too, so it's it's a little complicated by you know I want to be careful with him so some of them. look a little beyond. what's going on with you. And that's on me I gotta give that some thought, I want to really think about how to enter and it might mean that. How would you may ask you something, how would you feel about meeting, if we can briefly for five minutes, right at the end of group where it's just the three of us how would you feel about that. let's just to really give this attention because i'll be able to talk much like what i'm doing right now. there's something not doing it, and I think, with everyone there. I just don't want to diminish his sense of authority and and you know, by bringing up this other approach it's just I think it might be better if it's just the three of us, I would know I would feel more comfortable doing it. And I might I might learn a little, something that I don't know from that meeting to i'm really open so i'd like to understand a little bit more so. I can make that happen that part, I can say hey if we have time, you know katie and Dr Solomon are you able to really sort of focus on trying to find the right dose for katie."
11339.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Now that can do. If it looks yeah it looks like i'm forgetting feel you could do the same thing say hey can we meet right at the end, but looks like i'm going to forget I probably won't those soon as I hear you talking i'll probably remember this conversation. All right back. So just so I know that i'm just going to write a little note here. You did you end up going to 11 milligrams or I don't even know what you're at Do you know what your actual milligram doses."
11339.0,Patient,it's. 12. Because it's a Sherpa to have.
105.0,Provider,"yeah it is looks like it was 16 may 29. So you've gone down quite a bit now. And you're still reporting that it's having whatever those symptoms are so it's still need some attention. Well i'll take a peek on what else you got going on here. So we did we did touch on sort of organically wanting to work on communication and standing up for yourself so as you're setting boundaries you're noticing, maybe, what is your boyfriend's name, one more time. And, and he is doing what when you set your limits and boundaries what what ends up happening."
11339.0,Patient,Like gets annoyed.
105.0,Provider,It might be about the way you're delivering it can we can I hear a little bit about how your how you're saying it because it might have something to do with delivery not sure. Can you give an example of where you did it you saw his annoyance.
11339.0,Patient,Really off the top.
105.0,Provider,Well let's work backwards sort of get in touch with maybe a an argument or disagreement you've had with dominic recently. It may have been about job it may have been about that documentary Those are two things that you mentioned at least here today.
11339.0,Patient,The documentary documentary.
105.0,Provider,So. Do you can you see how. I don't know but was there a boundary setting behavior you you engaged in around when you were sitting with him watching the documentary Do you see any of it as you setting your limits with them.
11339.0,Patient,"My limits, but I definitely like instead of being like. Like a little bit more open to understanding I automatically kind of got defensive and I was like, why are you like judging that person. Instead of away. Filling. Filling it out and seem like hey what is this bringing up in me why do I feel hurt. And maybe, what does it say about the other person or What could it be bringing up for the other person as well."
105.0,Provider,"yeah so really this is interesting, because what may have happened is your boundary was actually too rigid, then it was maybe putting up this wall when really what may have been a useful boundary with him, would have been more porous which means open. And Honorable so we were talking just now, I was saying let's pick one where it might have been the delivery, so you ask someone why. And if anything i've taught soon as we ask someone why they're going to feel defensive because we're going to have them defending their position. So, even though let's say today we're saying well you know soon as I set my boundaries dominic gets annoyed well, maybe. it's how are we setting our own, how are we delivering. Information and that's where communication comes in, when you get tempted to ask somebody why. want to challenge yourself see if you can come up with another way to get information. So sometimes will say. How will, I know, it seems like isn't that the same thing, but it isn't. Did you. How did you come to have that belief. How did you develop that that that knowing of what rock bottom line is, you know how do you know that, how is it different your rock bottom from from hers. That how how did you come to this conclusion i'm curious. You know. it's just something to keep in mind when you have a choice to skip why."
11339.0,Patient,You may want.
105.0,Provider,"To do it because it tends to create defensiveness and people. Language trick. And because, because what happens to you, if I do it to why did you why did you get so defensive, it was his opinion with a documentary."
11339.0,Patient,that's.
105.0,Provider,Why it's an it's a kind of a bit of an attack.
11339.0,Patient,Would it be a Defense.
105.0,Provider,that's right and that's universal we all feel that way and i'm going to have to justify my opinion.
11339.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"We don't fundamentally want to do that, we don't want to at our core think I have to come up with a good enough argument to have my own opinion and no so it brings all that up and it's unconscious but yeah it's unpleasant so if we don't want to provoke that defensiveness. We skip it all together and say dominic i'm really surprises me, what are you thinking as you're watching her describe that's her bottom, what are you thinking about and then he tells you. rock bottom rock bottom is your what was it's losing your car. yeah and does he have a car. That an interesting place to explore. Like maybe he's feeling really low."
11339.0,Patient,"copper beaches everything, though."
105.0,Provider,"How we talk to each other, it really does it matter so isn't it."
11339.0,Patient,"yeah you can like get a whole different approach, just by the language or like the words that you use."
105.0,Provider,"And it was neat that you picked up on first you start with the self purse you sort of say i'm having this big reaction to his. is saying this about the program what's going on, for me, because if we don't take a second and figure out what's going on for us we're more likely to do projection. You know, all kinds of things that we end up regretting or you know getting angry or whatever, but if we do take the time and think about what's going on for us first. we're less likely, I think, to misstep and say something out of that anger."
11339.0,Patient,That make sense yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Just curious about the get up early thing I know it's on your radar trying to get up early everyday aside from today is a one off. What is it been like what do you what are you doing as far as you want this routine of getting up early Oh, you said you want to wake up, at the same time, every day, is the primary goal what's that look like."
11339.0,Patient,"Oh it's been going pretty good except for That said, I really like beat up fairly good has kind of like put that to the wayside, for the past few days. But other than that it's been pretty good i've been getting up. I want to say, like four days, four out of the seven days consistently. Just like having to get up for the dogs the dogs are like already at a routine they wake me up like eight so that helps but."
105.0,Provider,It does help I bet. You don't want you don't want to clean the mess up. it's motivating to get up. yeah okay so that's convenient. Okay cool. Right um let's schedule something i'm thinking to two weeks.
