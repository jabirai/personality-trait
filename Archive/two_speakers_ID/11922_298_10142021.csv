You may need your insurance to get a prior authorization, you can do that through the virtual clinic the virtual clinic will. help you get that prior authorization you'll know by calling your pharmacy or visiting them and they say oh your insurance has denied it right now, or something called the call and ask about it. If we find out that this medicine is the one for you, we may go to a longer acting one you get out of your system in six hours. and It burns out it so you take the first one in the morning and make sure that you take the other one in the early afternoon, so that it's out of your system. If you want to take a drug holiday, you are welcome to do that, but if you find that you're getting. overwhelmed very easily it may not be good to do drunk holidays so you'll kind of have to play with it, when you first get it try a half tablet and see how that feels maybe do a day or two of just a half tablet twice a day."
