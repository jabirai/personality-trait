17931.0,Patient,"Well, you see a kinda you know he removed him up here from Virginia and. September, maybe October ish something like that, and you know we were supposed to my wife is supposed to sell off his house down there and then he had a house up here. And they were supposed to take the money from that and get them into an assisted care living, you know it was like five minutes from us, you know, some are real close. To where we. Can drop any check on them whenever and I wouldn't be a hassle. But uh you know my sister in law she's got some issues and she can TIM i'd like $60,000 out of all the profits of the House up here and the House down there he only made like you know 11,000 or something. he's got a he's got a pension, you know it's not. I mean it's enough, you know it's enough for him to you know maintain a decent life but at some point, you know his medical expenses are going to. You know."
235.0,Provider,"Well, just just for fyi is that once he meets the third certain threshold of his savings being depleted down to like I think it's $2,000 that the Fed takes over and like if he's in a care facility they'll go ahead and cover it."
17931.0,Patient,yeah see I think my wife had looked into that also but there were some other things that like. Within like certain seven years or something they can come back and. I don't know retake the House if it was sold within the family and are out there was some there was some some some hurdles there.
235.0,Provider,So there's some stipulation and it's a big old mess with with the the sisters bumping heads and you know and.
17931.0,Patient,"Well, my sister in law she's just a I mean she's she's so messed up right now she's you know she was supposed to be recovery um. I mean come to think of it, I think I think she might be on this medication as well. um but she you know she we know she's been doing adderall a lot. And just you know she ended up cheating on my brother in law she's done a lot of things man she she kicked my my niece out in the middle of the street at one o'clock in the morning, no bare feet crying. because she didn't want to go to work with her the next day because she would make her daughter work all day at this restaurant and collect her pay as well from her boss. Excuse me yeah it's like sickening bad."
235.0,Provider,"Would piss me off big imagine you are. So you got to have healthy boundaries, make sure that you know that you keep your cool and stuff and you know I don't care if she's on this medication or not, if she's she evidently has. Some major medical stuff going on, I mean mental stuff going on to be to do that to to your Nice and stuff like that you know. yeah and and to take advantage of I mean that's totally self absorbed type of thing, like the whole world revolves around me and F everything else. And boy my heart goes out to you guys, especially your wife and and dealing with this whole situation, and it must break her dad's your your father in law it's hard to see what's happening."
