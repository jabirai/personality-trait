I thought it was just medication assistance so that's what got me that there was an eating disorder and so that's something I actually struggled with since I was about like I was about 14. We have about 1415 so it's actually like one of my triggers so. Like i've been. Because they every time I get clean. I in a relaxing because I never deal with it i've never been able to find anybody who does she meant for it. Okay, so like yeah that's actually one of the reasons, like. Well, aside from a car accident that's one of the reasons why you should go with that means, because you know or have you know. Because i've never been able to like he had never been able to get feedback for that so they. They get into it for against for you."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah yeah.
15150.0,Patient,"They said that you guys also have like a mental health team to. But they were saying like to talk to you about that, when we do the assessment because they're. Just so you know I guess cuz I tried to determine in the beginning what's exciting I have anxiety and add, but like they said. Okay, some of it could stem from. Like the eating disorder, of course, like anxiety so. They said they get this set up first and then see about after I talk to you see if we can get something set up maybe for mental health. Sure sure yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Definitely yeah so i'm i'm going to kind of focus today because they specifically wanted us to address the eating disorder assessment today so. So that's what we're going to kind of focus on as far as and i'm going to take notes, and so, if you see me with my head down or i've got I got my notes and questions, so I can make sure we do a really good thorough assessment to so. ronnie tell me a little bit you said you're eating disorder started around. 13 or 14 1414 okay. Was there anything that particularly triggered it at that time."
15150.0,Patient,"And I know that um. I was why I guess it's just I started high school I used to get picked on a lot, because when I was younger I was overweight. Okay um. So um I don't even know where I got I dia that. Like it started out like as it started out with. Like I guess like as I started out as believing in I had a friend, I had a friend that um. I guess I just got tired of being picked on and I don't know where the idea came to my head, I mean, I had a friend that did it asked her to show me how to do it okay. So um I guess like later, as in the door, like it kind of went from. Okay, because I started having like physical problems with it at one point i'm like like I still have this gotta check that like like I I couldn't, I guess, I still can't make I couldn't do it anymore so then it went from from."
527.0,Provider,As far as like the purging behaviors you couldn't do.
15150.0,Patient,"Right so it's like right now oh cuz I mean it's been from like a like a kind of busy right yeah like. It kind of went from from mega is still burns I don't binge eat really and then I like a had a couple's of exercising. So, like I got and I know before I had a substance use disorder, I wanted to join the military at one point so like. I had learned how to like I guess like workout and manipulate calories because they taught you how to you know, and I ended up getting in a car accident and never went in so. So, for I want to say, for the last like maybe. You know 10 or 11 years it's just kind of been like because i've managed to maintain my weight, well, I mean i'm like a little bit under what I normally been like cuz I mean it manages to usually maintain it at about 150 but then like. And I don't really know how to explain it like I know is still like I still like prayers every once in a while, but I don't like it like benji you know, again I don't even know exactly what it is. Okay here what I had I just know that I obsess over my way all the time I obsess over what I eat. Every time I get clean I got again i've been pregnant twice and like i'm gay that's where the mess Cayman because, like like. Before I was I don't know if it makes it Okay, so my oldest daughter is 10. When I got when I got pregnant with her. I didn't overeat or anything, when I was pregnant with her like hey I worked out everything and I did everything I was supposed to and like I. guess I don't know i'm going into starvation mode like I kind of just gained it back and then after I have her that's where I started using like mess and they can go to the exercise to get the weight off. OK, and then, so I know. I know I kind of jumped around I don't know if."
527.0,Provider,"that's okay. And, did you have to two pregnancies you says. Okay where's your children okay. Right any other miscarriages abortion."
15150.0,Patient,"Yes, I had in between okay so right after. Right after I had. My oldest daughter um I got. Pregnant um. Okay, shortly after that and then that was kind of one of the reasons why I didn't. That was the biggest reason why I didn't keep that pregnant, because I didn't get fatter."
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay oh. Okay, did you did you aboard that pregnancy or. Yes, okay."
15150.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean I know it's just I mean that's how. stupid, but yes."
527.0,Provider,it's okay. I know some of these questions are probably pretty intrusive and. we'll do our best to work through them okay run yeah. Okay yeah so tell me a little bit specifically what your current behaviors are like what as far as like restricting you said you're. currently doing any benji benji eating but you've got some purging so. what's what's kind of your frequency of behaviors at this point.
15150.0,Patient,"i'm. Like. I am any treatment centers it's a kind of hard and they're about the Embassy of just somewhere else, they can go concerned, they just got back from a meeting so all the girls are about to walk in right now. Okay, so let me just give me a second and see if I can go somewhere else. So let me go somewhere else. Or let me, let them go to different. I did i'm in an appointment right now and i'm Susanna i'm doing an appointment right now with the therapist so like it's covenant, just like I don't know there's somewhere where I can go away from everybody. i'm in an appointment i'm.

527.0,Provider,"Like yeah. So, are you in a residential program or sober living one yeah."
15150.0,Patient,i'm in a residential treatment program right.
527.0,Provider,Now for the.
15150.0,Patient,"For the substance use. So um that's also while I was here like well, I wanted to just address that so i'm okay like at first when I first got here i'm. Like because, while I was using math like it didn't really like I didn't really I didn't really like purge and I didn't really busy because, like. You know I didn't really worry about it because, like, I was riding my bike I guess I would ride my bike all the time and I actually like. Like right now still I mean i'm not sure I gained like maybe five or 10 pounds and they've been in here but i'm right now i'm still smoke are gonna rub it will they weighed me like a week ago i'm like 130 and my average is like 150 so I actually got below where i'm normally yeah. Okay, so like a stress on that all the time, like I don't so i'm. Like I don't know like i'm constantly obsessing about it, I don't like. i'll probably add the most like the last night we don't like anything but like. I got have a salad for dinner and then like. If it's what it's like I restrict my food intake because I, you know I like notice that my parents got a little bit. Okay, so like not want to eat breakfast I don't want to eat lunch like i'll chew and spit out my food like if it's anything like other than like salad if it's something that like makes my my stomach fruitful i'll chew and spit out a flow. So if I like. eat more Okay, so if I eat more than what fits in the palm of my hand. that's where the anxiety comes in and that's where like. Like a purge but I don't sit down eat all day long like you know what i'm saying we have like breakfast lunch dinner."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're not you're not over the last week you haven't eaten breakfast or lunch."
15150.0,Patient,"Right. Okay i'm. Like I haven't eaten breakfast like i'll make myself something small for lunch, but i'll probably chewed up and spit it out."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15150.0,Patient,And normally like if I don't feel hungry like I felt. Okay. yeah.
527.0,Provider,"um so tell me a little bit with purging. Rania to us, do you do you vomited use laxatives diet pills have used, you know diuretics are in. Such."
15150.0,Patient,"As her anything else we're in a substance use disorder, so I can't I can't have anything else, like that."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15150.0,Patient,"let's have some of the dirty know me but I mean it's not like well lately, the last like week or so it's become like. like an everyday thing, even if I don't feel like i've noticed I started to like. You know. More you know, even though, like. I mean, but I don't like I don't benji and it's not every single time I eat it's probably about once a day okay I didn't do it at all yesterday, but all I had was like three apples and then maybe like. You know. They do that too, like I obsess over what a great."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure is there things that you particularly avoid wrong yeah.
15150.0,Patient,"i'm heavy foods like breads. Okay i'm. Like breads a lot of cheese like carbs. Like make spaghetti noodles in big family last night we had spaghetti a. So. pretty much if it's not like, fruit, vegetables or salad I like will either spit it out or. Like I want."
527.0,Provider,"How many times a week, do you feel."
15150.0,Patient,At least seven.
527.0,Provider,seven times a week. yeah okay. More than once a day.
15150.0,Patient,"um I wouldn't say it more than once a day, no. It depends, there was one day, where it was one day, where like."
527.0,Provider,But it's at least daily. you're purging at least once daily.
15150.0,Patient,"Yes, but. Like I said, like, if I can avoid it I can like I said, like mostly like all like stood out my food, so if I do have to like because I worry like I said I worry about like because I suddenly i've had for a long time, so I worry about like my health and stuff. Like I mean I know that's on their mind."
527.0,Provider,But like I know there's physical symptoms.
15150.0,Patient,Oh.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. And you said you've not had any. treatment for your eating disorder ever. never, never okay okay ever been diagnosed. By any providers."
15150.0,Patient,"Okay well. Yes, and they diagnosed me with the purge it called a perfect disorder. So. They don't really like I don't really sit there and benji it's not like I can't stop it's. Like more of an avoidance when it comes to food, instead of not being able to control myself. So okay right."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah definitely. So Tommy. Are you going back to I know you can't use any substances in the facility, but have you ever had any. Problems with like diet pills or laxatives in the past."
15150.0,Patient,And now does just mess like.
527.0,Provider,That man wearing a mask amen okay okay.
15150.0,Patient,So yeah.
527.0,Provider,Okay gotcha. um yeah. So tell me is that kind of like.
15150.0,Patient,"That kind of that kind of was like an all in one thing. You know what i'm saying like it just. Like the mass was it like like when I use my own sake. I don't worry about it, like I said I don't I don't like stress on it as much because it kind of like it speeds up metabolism and i'm always riding my bike so. It sure kind of naturally came off without me doing anything so like I it's it's like it goes away. Almost in a sense. Like and then as soon as I get clean I start like that's when the obsession comes I mean not that I don't obsess over like way look like, but I don't necessarily have to worry about like what eight exercise because. You know, like I said it just. Like and I didn't even mean to get like I was just trying to get back to like my average weight, which was like 150. And I got below that they've been trying so and it's like I know that but, like, I still obsess over it. is time to day basis, I can my clothes fit. And drives me crazy that there's not a scale you here."
527.0,Provider,Because they don't know like.
15150.0,Patient,"You know, maintain like in, and I might change so like I miss my period of time stressing on it and wait, like my clothes, but I constantly think about like you know, like if my belts too tight like how many loops I can get to you know in. My pants like i'm always like here my fat low fat low fat like I like just it's just a constant like five or seven like a can't ever enjoy like whenever he can't ever doing like it's like you know it's like I hate having to go and eat something. I like I get anxiety instantly every something and then it's just like from it's constantly like more than more than I obsess over like drugs like that's the easy part like because. i've done it so many times and she was when I get clean it's a constant obsession over like what I look like, and I can see like somebody can tell me all day long you know, like i'm 133 pounds. or whatever that every time wait, but I don't see that."
527.0,Provider,But yeah yeah. Definitely a distorted body and it sounds like yeah yeah. Do you know running out what your. What your highest weight has been outside of your pregnancies what your height and weight yeah.
15150.0,Patient,and
527.0,Provider,"I will talk about your. pregnancies, but like yeah outside of your pregnancy is your highest weight and when that was."
15150.0,Patient,"When I was. 14 I was a freshman in high school, I was about 230 pounds."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, do you know what your lowest weight has been, and when."
15150.0,Patient,"Right now. My. wallet which was they waved me and. She and i'm not quite sure, because when I went to jail, they said, like, I want to deal with, I came in here and they said it was 1.8 but i've never been 120 like I bet it was I want to say that they got it wrong and that was about 130. Is when I went to the hospital, they said I was 133 OK, and then, so this is this, this is unless i've gained his this was about a week and a half ago swim this i've gained anything since then it's still been probably about right now. Because i'm sure I didn't gain that much in the last week and a half. Okay."
527.0,Provider,"Now, how did."
15150.0,Patient,How did you mean other than like five or 10.
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah how did you do like your pregnancies. Wrong yeah.
15150.0,Patient,What do you mean like.
527.0,Provider,"Like as far as did you did you, you know follow doctor's orders and gain gain weight normally through your pregnancies and."
15150.0,Patient,"With the second one I kind of I kind of didn't but, like, I know I again like and that's what I didn't understand about the first one like because I followed, like the diet and exercise with my first pregnancy um. But I gained I like it was 150 both times and by the end of my pregnancy, I was 236 pounds with my first one, and then 200 with my second one."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15150.0,Patient,And I was 150 both times and I got pregnant. Like okay I got. It going back down.
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay good. yeah and how do you know how tall, you are 5656."

15150.0,Patient,i'm. Like. What was the first one.
527.0,Provider,"And, just like any any irregular labs. I didn't hurt issues anything."
15150.0,Patient,"I don't think so I haven't had a period of this month. But like that could also be because I. I don't know like normally my peers are regular um I haven't had one this month, yet that but that could also be because they started me on set be tags that could be because. Okay that's probably just because, like i'm getting clean i'm around a bunch of girls and then my body is probably like in a shock because i'm. Sure stress yeah. i'm sure i'll get it here soon i'm not putting them into the pregnancy test so. Okay i'm sure it's just. You know, getting clean and."
527.0,Provider,All that right sure yeah.
15150.0,Patient,"But other than that I don't I don't think so, I mean, I had a. I have what I saw was a high over me. I get like when I when I swallow like out it feels like there's like a lump rate like in between, I read. But then. I had where they stuck something now and they can't remember what they called it, I."
527.0,Provider,"Like it, they said it wasn't like endoscopy they said it."
15150.0,Patient,"yeah. And then, so they said it wasn't a hernia like it wasn't a hiatal hernia and I forgot what they called it. um but they they said, I think it just irritate they said, I think it was just being there was a name for it and they told me to take like a. Like something for acid because they said it was just like I guess it was just it just irritated Okay, but it never goes away. Like it never goes away like it and I I don't like it feels like when I swallow like there's one like so I don't know they said that they didn't see anything but. I saw like problems with it like I don't know if ice. swallow wrong or something like I can feel it and I think that's about like the only thing that I so that. And then. um I guess like my teeth in."

To get to the hospital or the emergency room or. Crisis numbers. Yes, okay okay good."

Good is a women's facility so there's there's. there's plenty for our staff here, for the moment, so right now, like I have something I can go talk to you right.

527.0,Provider,"Good good yeah so tell me. Tell me a little bit about. let's see where Am I at here. So tell me a little bit about what you know growing up in your family, you know what. Ideas or thoughts were around food or weight or body image growing up for you around yeah."
15150.0,Patient,"There wasn't really a late. My mom I mean there wasn't really any of my mom like my mom and always they only Delhi my mom and my dad owned a Deli and it was more so, like. My mom was always fit like she always like I remember she always like walked my parents were overweight, they never like they always cook healthy, you know what i'm saying like they never really, you know as far as that's concerned like they never really had like. I mean, I think it was just like when we were kids like because they owned a Deli it like we just ate when we got bored because you're on the Deli and then I. started to get picked on it when they didn't like it, because I think it was more so, like that that that would, I think they affected me the most was because kids are mean when you go to school."
527.0,Provider,sure.
15150.0,Patient,"And I got teased at school for IBM fat a lot and never had a boyfriend throughout high school because I was the fat kid well, I mean. Up until my later years it started coming off like you know I mean think, by the time I graduated high school when I was like about 100 and maybe 70 when I graduated so I. carry a little bit more well, so it started to kind of lesson. When I got. But you know, I think it was just like because my mom and my dad never really I know. i'm like I said it was more so the kids at school, I know that I was working with somebody at one point, because my mom and my dad are divorced. My dad was physical with us well, I mean not on a day to day basis, but I mean he was physically abusive to my mom."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15150.0,Patient,And verbally so. Somebody had mentioned that that could be a possibility. Maybe like it my issues with my dad may have manifest.
527.0,Provider,It in eat into I don't know.
15150.0,Patient,"Okay, just some trauma."
527.0,Provider,"Did you witness that Rania with your parents. Yes, okay. Okay, how long did that go on for like do you know how about where your ages."
15150.0,Patient,As long as I can remember.
527.0,Provider,Where you really got divorced.
15150.0,Patient,"11 and I remember yeah and I remember. Like I always remember them. Fighting maybe I wanted to okay like so I can remember being four and we lived in North Carolina I remember moving here before I started school, so I want to say, at least at least five."
527.0,Provider,Years oh wow I can remember.
15150.0,Patient,"So some at least five like at least a big ring. Right sure, and I remember. Six years yeah so I mean as far back as I can remember."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15150.0,Patient,"I can remember a little bit of when we were in North Carolina so that was before age five I do room actually remember a little bit I don't remember it been but from about five on. I remember hearing them fight and when like they got divorced like I was happy that they were getting divorced, I was excited and like I remember, I was really excited because I didn't want to have to hear them, are you like, I was stressed out like. I know. So I remember that I remember I didn't want to tell my mom and my mom and dad they were getting the worst like i'm so. and I felt guilty for thinking that like, but I can remember that, like, I remember like when they told me, I was like thinking like they're getting the words they don't have to like here anymore and i'm in pain and I wouldn't have to make. Sure, and I think that that has something to do with like I know for sure, like when i'm here in a treatment. Like I get stressed out a lot. And there's like new people coming. coming in. there's like you know because I have a fear of like you know, being in a House with a bunch of girls. Okay, I have a fear that just going to be like chaos and I won't be able to go to sleep. And then everybody's gonna fight, I know that that's probably what that comes from."
527.0,Provider,"Okay sure. Do you have any. Oh go ahead, sorry I cut you off."
15150.0,Patient,"No, no you're fine I was just gonna say like a I can at least identify that that's where that comes."

Like it ends and stuff like that, but he has a messed up back so I don't know I didn't see I saw some substance use with my dad but I never saw any addictive behaviors."
527.0,Provider,So.
