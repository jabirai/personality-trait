You know, but you know by freedom started where there's ended, so it was like. I really couldn't relate that much you know what I mean it's it's like I could still leave if I felt like I could still smoke cigarettes, I want you know it is. A little shit like that, but I was like we are in a sense, all locked in here for the next eight hours, whether or not we like it or not, so so yeah for sure. Okay, so what you were diagnosed with these things by a psychiatrists worker yeah. How long ago was that."
15137.0,Patient,"i'm like I was when I was 19 I was in I was in Texas, I want to stay hospital, but when I was younger really because of you know, when I was a kid I used to have role was all grown up and stuff like that add add stuff like that and. Then, like. Just you know. You probably got her to sit down is probably safe stories everybody who's using this and they buy chocolate cakes."
724.0,Provider,yep. that's a certain certain to bring you up to a certain degree. we're all broken in our own ways and looking for the meaning of life.
15137.0,Patient,yeah they look yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's out there, you know, like you know you and I are going to meet, probably for individual so we could we could wax poetically about existential angst and. You know what I mean like, but there is like a lot of weirdness as to like how we exist so sometimes. Like i'm not super religious, but sometimes i'm like oh shit there's gotta be something else, like it doesn't make any sense that. Is conversations on a giant rock that's flying through space into infinity and like nobody else is having these conversations, at least on this planet, which is strange right, I mean so it's like it might be something to it. What I like about sorry and religion is that they both agree that we didn't get here without each other so science kind of you know, in its infancy. We couldn't explain like why it rains so we just use, you know myths and legends to explain what way the things that we didn't know but that caused. are created, creativity and thirst for knowledge, so, then we. got to a point where we challenge those ideas and then we discover like will it rains because humidity from the ground rises up and it gets to a certain level gets trapped in a cloud and the cloud so hold it. Just long enough and they'll it maxes its way down and then it rains back down and then it just repeats this process and it's like."
15137.0,Patient,"it's not like, like all life has been cycling dang you know i'm saying."
724.0,Provider,"Right so, but without you know, without the religious people want to be able to function like early on, you know what I mean."
15137.0,Patient,"Society would be fucked up a lot of people would guess it would be no. Like health scares, a lot of people through. You know year so."
724.0,Provider,You know control yep. yep yep if you didn't if we didn't have any kind of science or information we'd be Afghanistan so.
15137.0,Patient,yeah yeah pretty most.
724.0,Provider,People want to see what like the Sony just looks like you go to some third world countries and i've been to some third world countries so it's very much like the Stone Age.

15137.0,Patient,cocktail yep.
724.0,Provider,"But i've seen people not respond. Like like like their their chemistry just eight through with like they've been medicated and you're like normally people go down within 30 minutes, they don't I mean like they're creating and I go down but i've seen people like power through for hours on like that's. that's crazy. You know what I mean. Like just crazy, they should be snooze fest right now for like six hours better not I worked in the psych unit at a hospital before I came here, so I learned a lot."
15137.0,Patient,crazy shit.
724.0,Provider,"For sure for sure I see them struggling you know with addiction I seen a lot of struck people struggle with their mental health, a lot of people that were. At their wit's end. You know. Based on."
15137.0,Patient,Just what you think you got a bad you look at the next one is like I likes really a debit.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it's hard when I meet people and they're like i'm anxious and then i'm like. You got a job, like yeah i'm like you got friends so again, like a boyfriend or girlfriend like yeah i'm like you're not anxious. i've seen people that are accessing they can't even function it's like. But again, you know people's interpretation of how they feel I can't i'll never be wanted like judge it but i'm just like. Maybe we people tend to over use some of those diagnosis is when it's probably not appropriate, you know I mean like that there are some people out there, that their body just doesn't allow them to self regulate and i'll."
15137.0,Patient,"say to like. me i'm i'm i'm lucky i've always been able to go thank right and stuff like that i'm just like hyper i'd like. My prop most problems i'm. Spot I wouldn't do it, they right now don't think it through and."
724.0,Provider,"impulse control. And yes, regulation, you know. A lot of times when people have true me. Were you diagnosed with that as a kid right. yeah so that helps because, as an adult if you could die it's hard to diagnose an adult would add if they miss it. So then, like a lot of the symptoms will will present as depression or anxiety and really it's add you know what I mean so sometimes like people get thrown on all kinds of prescription drugs. mood stabilizers and ssri is all kinds of stuff and it's like you have any if you just put them on adderall or Ritalin they probably chill out."
15137.0,Patient,"know I calm down like when I started methamphetamines calm down, but you know, I see a lot of people don't bug me."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
15137.0,Patient,i'm you know sound pretty much mellow.
724.0,Provider,"And that's how you know, like like we like."
15137.0,Patient,We it's kind of like people got gives me anxiety real bad marshalltown and like just be different.
724.0,Provider,yeah that's your chemistry so like people that have real add when they take Ritalin or adderall they're kind of they kind of balance out. Whereas people that don't have. Attention issues they take adderall or Ritalin there through the roof so. that's how you know your your chemistry right. um any history of self harm suicidal thoughts behaviors attempts.
15137.0,Patient,No never. ever. tried check out about it.
724.0,Provider,"Good now, you said ptsd. You and I will we meet will will unpack that a little bit and. Try to develop some like decent coping strategies if it's debilitating you know a lot of times when you're institutionalized or if you see in some if you've seen some shit. it's hard to or it's easy to repress that so even talking about it sometimes is a lot of work, but little by little. You know, the more you talk about it's like anything else you just start to open it up and then allow that the kind of process and your development strategy for but ptsd is kind of difficult because in the beginning. guys we just bury that stuff that I would."
15137.0,Patient,like it.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and deny it, and then carry like that, for a long time so that's a difficult one, but i'm going to assume that, because you were incarcerated you've probably been exposed to more traumatic events and than the average person has so for sure. Definitely yeah for sure."
15137.0,Patient,But to me it's normal to other people will be like change because they like.
724.0,Provider,"it's abnormal. yeah yeah and and the way that like ptsd is to like in those settings is like. anybody can get ptsd you can get it from a car accident, but when you're in a setting to where your automatic nervous system, which is like the part of your nervous system that just runs."
15137.0,Patient,You know it's good.
724.0,Provider,"You can't control how much you Blank or how your heart pumps, or how your lungs work that's all automatic a lot of digestive that's all automatic sign up to you. And with attached, that is your periscope at that. parasympathetic nervous system, which is your fight or flight right. So. When you're the screen froze again. So you still there."
15137.0,Patient,yeah i'm here.
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so when your parasympathetic nervous system, which is your fight or flight kicks in what happens is once it's kicked in and it stays on for a period of time."
15137.0,Patient,It definitely good night.
724.0,Provider,"And you can't turn it off that's where you become hyper vigilant you're anxious around people it's hard to turn that off when it's been on for so long, so like a good they've done a study recently in the military. where people can go to war and come back and be totally fine and some people can't so they think of like navy seals off anything navy seals have ptsd based on like this study."
15137.0,Patient,I say. Other life probably.
724.0,Provider,"You would think that it would be higher, but it's not it's because their task is they come they're given a list of a target they go and they execute the target capture kill whatever it is. That I."
15137.0,Patient,stay calm.
724.0,Provider,"yep well they're they're nervous system is for sure running because it just can't be a robot it's amped up, but then the task is done, and then they returned back to wherever they came from. What about like like an army soldier who's like in a convoy and he has to go from point A to Point B and it's going to take all day and in between point A and point B. Is a hostile zone at any point between A and B 20 miles, they can be blown up and then somewhere, it is maybe the car breaks down or they're stuck and they have to do this operation every day for the next 12 months, what do you think their ptsd is going to be like. hi yeah why because they're they're nervous system is kicked on."
15137.0,Patient,A stage.
724.0,Provider,"And it stays on there and 11 all day every day for months on end hard to turn that switch off once it's been turned off what's the body's been conditioned to prime it's been on like that hard for those guys because they. One group is out essentially killing people the other group is waiting to die. that's like the like the mindset for them so when that system is on. Hard the flip off the other state that you're supposed to be in when you're not in that state and that's a rare state to be in. you're supposed to be what they call it the rest of digest mode we good just chillin everything is cool have that burning a bunch of calories i'm just here eating sleeping shifting just rest and digest taking it easy and every once a while. The nervous system kicks in and then i'm amped up and then amount of it be big into a fistfight real quick wasn't expecting it to and then i'm out of it. easy to turn off with like that right other people, though, when you're institutionalized where you're on edge all the time you don't know where the attacks going to come from. your mind your p's and q's scanning your environment your hyper vigilant guess what it's odd and you're not turning it off you turn it off when you go to bed, but the shit so loud. in prisons right to tell people when I worked in corrections and stuff like that, like, how is it scary I was like really it's not. it's not like how it is in the movies, you know you got things that you need to be concerned about, but you pick up on that very early just loud it's always loud."
15137.0,Patient,"yeah when I got when I did that five years ago, when I come home I woke up and I got drunk right I woke up at night, it was dark is never dark in here. You know, it was quiet man fucking straight attack like what's up."
724.0,Provider,"yep panic attack you know what I mean let him tell most people that's abnormal, but that was. You know what I mean or that's normal to wake up in the middle night never be quiet, but for you it's abnormal and what I mean that's again system. being turned on when it should be off now so it's hard to regulate so yeah for sure that's where that's where a lot of ptsd comes from and people that are in the know so i'm ex military people that aren't in the now they don't like it's hard to explain. it's like that people have ptsd maybe they get to a faithful and it screws up their day but you know, on the level it's not like being incarcerated it's not like being in a gang it's definitely not like being like a combat zone like they're just these things that."
15137.0,Patient,You know there's.
724.0,Provider,"there's less there's levels to it for sure you know what I mean and it's hard to turn over and if you've been incarcerated for X amount of years you know I mean like that's yours, that your brain and advisement program and it's hard to shape that it's hard to shake the."
15137.0,Patient,tree yeah I got katie's turn God just sitting in bed like where i'm at right now all day long i'm setting you're not nothing just.
724.0,Provider,know.
15137.0,Patient,It was a blackout everything you. Know it's crazy to be Dave I get how you stay in the bathroom all day I just I just I just do it yields a.
724.0,Provider,"Yes, you're used to occupying a small space anyway so it's about living with the minimal."
15137.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I mean like again training conditioning repetition all that stuff man. hard to explain to people that don't experience it for sure for sure. So you and I will be able to talk about it more in depth as it goes on. All right, so how many times have you been incarcerated."
