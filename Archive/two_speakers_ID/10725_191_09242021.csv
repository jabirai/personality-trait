191.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you because the thing is I don't want you to feel like you have to say, the right things, but if you're not being just really raw really honest with us then.

With my mental health recently, I want to make sure i'm able and I don't want to rush anything because i'm afraid I must went to Glenn what psychiatric hospital because. Like you know I have my bipolar amendments and I I kept having crying fits and i'm like I packed my bags at my house, I like took my keys and slammed on the glass door with it like it was really bad and then my parents made me come home and my parents watch me and I took time off work. But like I did make sure I was safe and everything. But I made myself stay home because I didn't trust myself at the same time, you know what I mean."
191.0,Provider,When was this. uh huh.
10725.0,Patient,"It was like a week and a half ago, maybe two weeks ago. Not that long ago, really. Okay that's when they raised my packs a little 40 and, as I practice it a five it was just 20.5 but now it's 40 and five."

Okay. And for some reason, when I drink caffeine, it makes me crave.

I don't know make us stronger make us stronger what's the word. make a stronger wall and my mind to free away from that stuff instead of succumb to it, you know what I mean like i'm having cravings and i'm having trouble with it. But I know I can, and I want to work through it, because it's going to make me even stronger being around it does that make sense."
191.0,Provider,"It makes sense, but the thing is this you've got so many different things going on and understand when we want to do things but it's sort of like if you go to pick up a 200 pound dumbbell. You have to flex those muscles to do 200 pounds you've made from from what i've heard you say you've grown, but you may only be at 75 or the ability of 75 pounds or hundred pounds, but the dumbbells or 200 pounds and. It doesn't it concerns me, because there are a couple of things one you've got let's let me look at it, you can tell me if i'm overthinking this because you know you.

191.0,Provider,"Right, you can tell them you've got cravings okay um cravings, especially with the caffeine and okay for we'd have a history. of holding this use of the subjects, why did you hold your subjects."
10725.0,Patient,i'm afraid. That i'm going to miss too many appointments and get kicked out and not be able to get it again. i'm afraid to relax.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're afraid to relapse do you hear what i'm saying, do you hear what i'm saying, and are, and you can share your field with me Trevor but, even though you share your field with me. I still we at Bihar health steel want to do, and will do what's best for you. we're gonna have to do what's best for you so history of whole holding our service techs five still adjusting your mental health medicines. Okay. Okay um. And then. You say six, you said you had a mental health breakdown. You almost went to the hospital, but you phrase it as a mental health breakdown. yeah okay. Now i'm going to ask you this. I want you to have an out of body experience for a quick minute and I want you to be the adult Trevor and I want you to look at yourself like you're looking at your real self. Okay, taking everything out of the way. To talk to yourself. What would you say was the best thing for you to do right now to be safe."
10725.0,Patient,Like at this very moment.
191.0,Provider,"yeah to save your life to what do you feel you need to do right now, because sometimes you have to make a sacrifice now be impatient for 30 days or 60 days and once you're stable and you're set you come back to Bihar health and you go back to your job because Trevor."
10725.0,Patient,"Already took time off work, though, for that. Like I. I swear i'm doing better. I just really need. I just need time to learn more at this job it's just i'm learning a lot at one, and I think sometimes. I. I just underestimate myself too much."
191.0,Provider,"And you know something if those mental health medicines have not kicked in and your emotion your neurotransmitters are not stable, you may feel that way, this may be something that's not good for right now get stronger and do later. you're very intelligent, we know that. My greatest concern and we've had this conversation and i'm going to be really. My greatest concern is that there's too much on you right now. And it's just say. And this is gonna be my recommendation have have you have you been meeting with your therapist What about your other therapists have you been meeting with her or him."
10725.0,Patient,"I have, I have seen JESSICA like once. i'm theater. haven't scheduled i'm supposed to see her like recent like soon. Okay, but I mean if you want to I swear i'm doing good if you want to, we can meet more if you want."
191.0,Provider,"well. i'm you know i'm getting a different understanding and a different history, my concern is is is that there is potentially some things. That you may be doing are withholding your medicine, one of the things that really concerns me is the hold and other subjects that. That really concerns me, because if you slip up if you hold it enough, and you slip up on another medication your risk of overdoses hot so that's one of the things that really concerns."
10725.0,Patient,"Oh, my. Oh um I will be straight up honest with you, I i'm very, very safe with anything I take I mean, even if I am prescribed something at the doctor and they told me it's safe, I will still do the research about it and. Okay, when i'm on my sub you text. I I won't take anything, while i'm on it, because i'm honestly too paranoid, for that to happen, I really am. And I take my try I won't even take the transit on the prescribed me because of that and. I only take my site practice on paxil at night, and I will take it off the sub even the same time as my 76."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I hear what you're saying. yeah I see the marijuana. Last year, and draw spring so. I hear what you're telling me and a lot of things are just not adding up and it sounds inconsistent okay. i'm getting a different understanding of what's going on with you, and so my recommendation really is. going to be impatient. Even if it's just short term and then you can return to our health. Because i'm hearing you saying nervous breakdown medications adjusted. Still, addressing. Your very stress now. Trevor i'm hearing triggers i'm hearing cravings. Hold holding the Serbia Turks are mental health breakdown. And so, when I hear that and I see you and we enjoyed talking to you so much."
