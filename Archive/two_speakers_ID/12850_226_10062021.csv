And I was turned down because of my past mental health issues so that was discouraging but I guess it's for the better, anyway, I guess, so you know, maybe it would have been to I don't know think anxiety provoking or I don't know what but you know one door closes another door open so."
226.0,Provider,So did you have to leave a position because of mental health issues is that how they know.
12850.0,Patient,"Originally originally that's why I retired I retired early. On with disability yes. Five six years ago, it was, but that was six years ago. yeah but that's you know it's healthy, you know.

226.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so you've got some options."
12850.0,Patient,"yeah i'm yeah I yeah i'm never in a bad place it's just i'm always looking ahead to make sure i'm never in a bad place. yeah so yeah like I gotta keep i'm always having i'm a single woman, so I have to always be aware that there's not a backup you don't get a backup so I have to always make sure that I have enough and more. So i'm always on the lookout for you know extra. muscles, you know hustle hustle that."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.

226.0,Provider,"yeah alright, so what would be helpful to talk about today, what would you like to go."
12850.0,Patient,"um. I don't know um. dogs are barking at me now they're mad. I don't know really. i've had a good week last week I there's nothing that's really upsetting or concerning me right now so i'm just i'm just going with the flow. of life. yeah I can't really I really honestly I can't think I can't. point out a an issue or anything that's concerning me or that i'm worried about or. You know. So i'm Sorry, I know that we want to you know, we want to circle back to what we talked about last time I haven't been able to accomplish that i've accomplished, one of the three goals, I still need to go to the. To the support group. I want to go with a friend and she hasn't been available so i've been waiting to go with her, for the first time, so I have someone to go with, and then the second thing was. The second thing was Oh, the shoppers anonymous thing. And I went and looked at it, but I didn't see anything in my area so i've just got to keep looking."
226.0,Provider,How is the spending van have you been spending.
12850.0,Patient,"Better yes i'm more i'm being i'm being very much more cautious about things i'm eating more at home. yeah yeah i'm yeah because it's been trying to address it directly, so in my mind so like I was on my way home from work. Because it was yesterday, or whatever, and I was going to stop off, and you know get something to eat in a restaurant I said no, I bet stuff at home."
226.0,Provider,yeah so awareness.
12850.0,Patient,"yeah and acknowledging that it's an issue and then being aware of it, and then trying to work on it systematically you know little time not you know I get tired at the end of the day, so I just decided to decide Oh, I need I deserve to go across the street and get some dinner. And I have to remember that I can't look at it that way."
226.0,Provider,"Right right okay. Okay, so. let's talk a little bit about how it was with your sister so she did text you back and like what, what do you want."
12850.0,Patient,"Nothing I just wanted, I just want to not close the door on our relationship completely, I want to try to you know even small small small. Small gestures. You know, because in the past there's been times when she's ignored me completely and just never gets back so I was encouraged that she made the effort to get back to as well. Right so. yeah so. yeah I you know it has to do with this, what i'm talking to her about I was texting her about that my daughter, and her boyfriend just got a condo together. And they're looking into the future, I think they're going to be getting engaged, so I think she liked the topic so that's why she responded. interesting. yeah I think I think she's like the topic that I was bringing I was sharing with her so that's why I think she. responded, you know more quickly than she normally would have."
226.0,Provider,So what are. What are things that she just won't respond on.
12850.0,Patient,"I don't know I can't even put my finger on it, she was going for you know for about a month's time, no matter what I sent her a funny cartoon or if I sent her an article that I was reading. And said this sounds interesting don't you think or you know just you know I just tend to do that with everybody in my life if I if. We have a conversation about something and then I see something about it somewhere or see a cute little something on instagram where you know the horses pulling the tail on the donkey or something you know. i'll send it as a cute little oh remember this, or I was thinking about you. You know she just she just yeah that's my that's what I do with people because to me that helps them to know that i'm thinking about them and it gives them a little giggle for the day and it's like I feel good about that. yeah that kind of thing and usually they'll. send me a hahaha you know blah blah blah or something and it's a short little something. But she just doesn't reciprocate so she doesn't ever send anything to me and then oftentimes or, at least in the past, she hasn't even commented on something I would send her so I was happy that this last time she made an effort to you know, to respond so that was encouraging. So."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, what about. Things that you're doing for fun like to talk about things that are keeping you engaged."
12850.0,Patient,"yeah that's yeah i'm not so good at that part i've just been you know I come home i'm tired I eat I turn on the TV. I watch crime shows, I know that's not the best thing to be watching that I tune into different things too, but I just you know I go through days, where I just don't feel like making an effort. And I have a bike I want to start writing, but I have to get a helmet for the bike. So you know it's always like before you can do one thing you got to do like a bunch of other you know. And I just want to do it, you got to prepare for it plan for it. You know, have things you know have bike lock or whatever, so I just sometimes put off doing things that would be pleasurable because it's just seems like it's too much effort and I gotta stop doing that I gotta just you know go out there and just do it anyway. So I don't know I haven't got a new car."
226.0,Provider,"No, I don't think you mentioned that."
12850.0,Patient,"yeah I got a new card my son. Is the online the online manager for Volvo mission viejo so my previous car had a little over 100,000 miles on it and we had gotten that one together, he likes to he likes to he likes to be in charge of the cars, I drive. that's just personal. thing, and he wants to make sure i'm reading a safe card i'm on the freeway a lot more now. So if you want. You know, so we traded what we sold the other car to another dealership and I got a little bit of money out of it and then. Then I anyway, so I have a new car it's called a Pole Star and it's all electric car. And it's what Volvo selling us their electric car so it's not made it's not made by Volvo directly, but a lot of the parts and things are Volvo bobo sales. So anyway it so it looks just like my old car only it's a newer version, and it has you know and i'm learning how to charge it, you know i'm learning all kinds of other things. That are you know how to. Do you know how to operate it it's pretty simple it's a pretty easy car to drive. But you know. there's like a little iPad in the front and you've got to push all the. buttons and. I get confused some time. So I facetime him and he shows me what to push and what to do, and if I get caught up in something but i've learned how to charge it pretty much on my own and like it's charging right now, while i'm at home."
226.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12850.0,Patient,So that's been it's been fun learning something new trying something different so yeah. that's good.
226.0,Provider,So.
12850.0,Patient,"I don't worry about my car i'm not worried about my car anymore, because before i'd be worrying about you know the engine light went on, or you know things like that. And because it's you know new or whatever and it's at least I don't have to pay for any really maintenance things there's not liking transmission or oil changes or you know All there is is breaks and what's The other thing. breaks and battery I guess and tires. tires there's not really much maintenance in it it's a new car. So that's that's helpful because I don't I don't have worries about that kind of thing anymore, I mean not like I ever really worried a lot because it's been something went wrong my car he always come in trade cars with me and go take it into the shop for me. You know, but it was expensive it, you know, like you think it's going to be like you know, a $500 fix and it ends up being a 1200 dollar fix. You know that that kind of thing right that would stress me out. Right, you know not being able to be prepared for the unexpected situations and I don't have a big savings, I went through a lot of my savings are encoded for a couple of years, so. That was always an issue for me like I was always nervous about that trying to cut back on driving and not really doing things because I didn't want to take my car, any more than I had to."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
12850.0,Patient,"So now, I can you know I can feel free about maybe picking some day trips and stuff. And not feeling like i'm you know. You know what I mean right."
226.0,Provider,yeah remind me what part of California and again.
12850.0,Patient,i'm in southern California.
226.0,Provider,"So, like."
12850.0,Patient,i'm on the border of Orange county and La county.
226.0,Provider,yeah okay.
12850.0,Patient,"God literally literally on the border la county is a block away and i'm one block in to come. So we're we're. But it's not it's not a bad place to be though honestly oh i've been also looking for apartments because i'm wanting to downsize so I can save a little bit there too. So i've. So i've been getting off the freeway after work and looking in different little areas and but you know there's just not a lot available right now and it's expensive in California anyway. yeah so. yeah, and so what I have now is barely it's affordable, but very affordable so i'd like to find something a little bit less it's like two bedrooms and two baths and I don't need two bedrooms and two baths. So i'd like to find something a little bit more affordable, so I can you know you know, took a little bit of money away here and there. yeah so yeah it's just it's always you know you're always having to like navigate the financial picture. Just to be sure that you're you know, not in the danger zone or whatever so that's not shopping is going to be a big help. The electric car the charging is very inexpensive compared to buying gas, I can go a lot farther on the charge so that's all going to come together, I think, in the next few months i'm going to see don't able to save a little bit more, you know."
226.0,Provider,"Yes, perfect, I think that. I think that. You know not spending let's see how that like you might notice a huge difference from not spending money."
12850.0,Patient,"yeah I think so. yeah I think that's true i'm not on instagram anymore i'm not on Facebook, so a lot of my spending comes from the social media, you know when you see all these tantalizing things and i'm very impulsive i've been an impulsive like part of my character. That i'm working on being less impulsive and you know i'll wait another day to say gee Do I really need that and I have a. closet that you can walk in you know you could sleep in my closet when it's full of stuff so I really don't need anything. Right right I don't need anything I can get by in life with what I have i'm just i'm just a fashionista. i'd like to have. I am i've always been I mean when I got out of high school, the first thing I did when I went to college, I went to fashion Institute in La."
226.0,Provider,school.
12850.0,Patient,"But that only lasted like eight months because I had to drive and I wasn't there, I was only 17 at the time and I wasn't a very good driver to drive on freeways, so I didn't like I didn't complete the program I ended up going to state college and became a teacher instead but. Either way. i've never left and I never left the fun and you know of that so I always I always have been, you know, a stylish. dresser just because it's just my it's my thing like it, some people had some people don't my sister could care less she can wear the same three outfits and rotate them around every day of the week, and it doesn't bother her at all. Right, you know she's just we just have different personalities that way I just love it it's fun it's exciting it's it's just it's it's fun to put things together to try new things you know. you like."
226.0,Provider,to wear all the clothes in your closet.
12850.0,Patient,"i've got too many clothes to wear all them all the time I weren't seasonally, though, yes, I do where most of them, I mean, I have a few things that still have tags on them. Because at some point, I decided well if I ever needed some money, I could always return return as long as I got the tag on them. Like beings from nordstrom you can. Keep like for a long time. Even it's out of season they'll take it back as long as. you've got the tag on it. So so it's like so maybe some of those things were impulsive and I really didn't need to buy them, but for the most part, I pretty much where Oh, I also lost a lot of weight, a few years ago, I had weight loss surgery I had gastric a gastric sleeve put. So a lot of my clothes are too big, so what I do at night, while i'm watching TV is I take them in. kind of basic I used to get them to I used to get them tailored and I decided that was too expensive, I can just do it by hand and I can do it just as well. So I have a lot of clothes, that I can't work just because they're too big. there's like three sizes too big. So I just been taking them in and so after I take things and I start wearing those and then so i've got so i've gone through summer now i'm looking through my fault flows. Like you know, like last summer I was like I did it in the spring, I was doing all my springs, I mean just seems like every season, those are the clothes like pull out and start working on them, so now, I can wear them."
226.0,Provider,So when did you get this surgery done.
12850.0,Patient,"I got it done two years ago in January this year will be. it'll be three years camp yeah, and so I lost a lot of weight I lost like 80 pounds 90 pounds. wow okay yeah. That way, it was a good thing health wise to like my I was like borderline diabetic you know high cholesterol, you know all those things are you know you know moving up so. It was a good thing for me health wise it's put me in a better place, as far as you know, physical health."
226.0,Provider,Any side effects from it that you've noticed.
12850.0,Patient,"my stomach I mean I have issues with i've always had it whenever I you know I have you know anxiety and things like that, so my stomach has always been a sore spot with me. You know how to put this have certain parts of their body that just never. Even as a little girl, I always had a lot of nausea and a lot of stomach issues, so I still have those but i've learned how to work around them, you know I eat a lot of Soups. I tried to stay away from Friday and greasy food I don't drink milk that much anymore. Because milk is not my friend anymore. So i've had to adjust my eating patterns and for the better, I mean I eat better probably than I ever have. yeah so um yeah so but i've been feeling well i've been feeling well health wise, but I don't feel well health wise it affects my emotional health. If they go to they go together. yeah I go through a physical ailment and then i'm in a depression mode and then i'm down i'm when i'm feeling well i'm emotionally bit well too so. It works out better for me so yeah and I had it done in Mexico. There was a program does look like a program that they have in next to cali, and so it was a pretty easy surgery. It was all you know I did I went by myself that went really smoothly, you know the transportation to and from and the follow up afterwards, all that they have down to. To a science I get emails from them every few months, you know wanting information on how i'm doing you know the follow up well. It was very inexpensive it's only a $6,000 surgery. If I had it done there as opposed to having it done in states which would have been tons more money. So. I feel like that was a good decision that I made for myself for my health so. Simply my mammogram last Friday wouldn't get my mammogram done so. So far, so good if I hadn't gotten a report back so. i'm guessing. So I try to you know i'm trying my best to keep up with my you know my physical health. You know, trying to get my appointment scheduled and follow through with them, because sometimes I didn't do that you know what I mean. yeah. it's been helpful talking to you, I think, even just last time. I saw a difference in my mental outlook just the first time we met because i'm focused on what I want to do now having to talk to you, helps me to remember oh yeah there's three goals, I have. accomplished one of them now i've got two more to you know I have. In my mind, and I know i'm going to talk to you in a couple weeks. So I know I want to be able to share that i've gotten something done."
226.0,Provider,"Right so just helps keep you accountable. And just yeah. I just actually just talking is actually very cathartic and very healing okay that's that's I mean the fact that, like you know, today you didn't have much to go over is not a good sign that's not a bad sign okay."
12850.0,Patient,Good.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so that means you know that that you're really. you're regulating your emotions you're. Not up and down, you know you feel organized in your thoughts. organize your life that's something that you need to work on you're working on that you're taking steps to do that so."
12850.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm always trying to make friends always take steps to be better to do better to have you know, yes i'm always had never feel I never feel like satisfied. it's in my nature to always want to like as well, I wanted to sub two weeks I think something and being in the classroom is very it's always good for him. So that was a goal so God wanted me that i'm not going to be able to do now, but it's Okay, because it's you know I think to myself it's just as well there's i'm not meant to be doing that right now. So normally I would have been discouraged, I would have been down on myself, I would have been feeling badly, but I didn't."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
12850.0,Patient,Right it's kind of proud of myself.
226.0,Provider,Because I was like.
12850.0,Patient,"I can handle this that's fine I get it, I think that's probably just as well."
226.0,Provider,that's you know.
12850.0,Patient,"I mean, I went through a lot of effort, I mean you have to like you know in school districts, you have to go through hoops after hoop after hoop after hoop to get this done, but in the end, I think. I feel like Okay, I tried to do something I didn't you know I felt like I accomplished something just by trying to go through the hoops and right getting the resume and cover letter and getting all that put together, I felt like okay I work towards a goal okay didn't make it. But she did say that if I did go to a doctor and get a. bill of health, basically, if I go back to the psychologists or psychiatrists that that took me off work if they put me on work if you go back, but i'm thinking you know what no i'm probably it's probably a good thing, because it probably would have been too much for me, maybe."
226.0,Provider,uh huh.
12850.0,Patient,"You know and i'm thinking about it i'm thinking you know what I don't know if I really and I was only i've been in the hospital like three months ago, still so that's."
226.0,Provider,Right.
12850.0,Patient,"So i'm thinking, maybe in another year. I might reconsider that but for now I think it was probably a good decision that i'm not doing that because I sometimes think that you know i'm a spiritual person, and I think God puts things in my life for a reason. Take things away from me for a reason. And I don't argue with it, I just think him. yeah every day for helping me guide me through this this you know stuff. So yeah but normally I would have been discouraged, I would have been upset I would have been crying or at least feeling bad about myself, but I don't feel I didn't feel any of that yesterday. I was a little discouraged, but then again when I thought about it, I thought you know what that's probably just as well you know i'm not an early riser anyway. You know I don't. I don't I don't miss getting up at six in the morning to put myself together to get to work by 730 you know."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
12850.0,Patient,"And then the anxiety of going to a new. campus and having new kids and talking to other teachers and now, maybe that's just more than I can do right now anyway."
226.0,Provider,yeah great attitude I love that it's really great. Okay. i'm good okay so let's reschedule then. Wednesday October 20.
12850.0,Patient,"i'm better i'm i've narrowed down to my kids schedules i'm thinking today, Wednesday isn't a good day for me, I think the better days would probably be like Thursday."
226.0,Provider,What days your group again.
12850.0,Patient,"I don't go to group. On Friday, normally don't go to group. I could I teach Mondays Tuesdays and Fridays almost Mondays Tuesdays and Fridays almost the whole day."
226.0,Provider,So my senior days.
12850.0,Patient,That you know I do doctor appointments or I go out to lunch or do whatever my free or days are. Tuesdays and. Then I just tell you. there's Tuesdays and Thursdays yep Tuesdays and Thursdays are good Thursday.
226.0,Provider,October Thursday October 21 at one. Okay okay.

12850.0,Patient,"is nice seeing you too, thank you very much and i'm sorry that I came late, I will try very much not too that's why I think doing this on a different day would make a big difference because my students schedules that I have to be at their mercy some days. yeah."

12850.0,Patient,No worries it. looks like descending.
226.0,Provider,"I appreciate it, thank you."
