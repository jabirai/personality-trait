11474.0,Patient,"No so what's the last one um they sent me the cup and I couldn't go to the bathroom so I went and got my lab work done, and then the lab messed up my blood work, so I had to go back so that's been a whole ordeal."
214.0,Provider,it's gonna look funky.
11474.0,Patient,Hopefully it's backed by now that was like last week.
214.0,Provider,"It is not. But it was still in October, so we're still safe but we've. Definitely got to figure that one out. But you surveys done, which is great. um. You can over here Okay, let me tell him, are you. Are you."
11474.0,Patient,it's probably why they're only giving me like a few days of medication from the whole thing.

11474.0,Patient,I really hope I. didn't mess it up again.
214.0,Provider,"Well, I mean, let me just look up so you're in yellow. Because of the drug screen that's exactly what you're in you know. um."

She takes to them um. So work looking for jobs well."
11474.0,Patient,"um i've had like way too many interviews, to the point where i've been getting them confused i'm. i'm waiting. i'm waiting to hear about three different interviews that i've had in like the past week. Two of them are for social workers that are local hospital or local schools high schools. Which are new positions there but. I really want one of those so i'm going to be disappointed if I don't get it, and the other is. Another role within the hospital setting like but it's on the outpatient side. So I would take any of those."
214.0,Provider,Oh did did we get to acceptance with salary decreases in basically almost in the same room.
11474.0,Patient,No their salary is a little less than mine but not like half of what. The one job I got at the elementary school. which would have been great but. very responsible for me.
214.0,Provider,I would agree.
11474.0,Patient,mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,"So um. Okay, so how's the pain doing."
11474.0,Patient,"Actually, I had to miss work yesterday because my my back has been giving me just a horrible amount of pain and I don't think it's stress related it started Saturday i'm. almost to the point where I was like gonna call you guys and see if anything could be done, but I knew, you know, over the weekend i'm not open. it's been worse I don't know why but um yeah I couldn't go to work yesterday."
214.0,Provider,Because of the pain.
11474.0,Patient,yeah mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,Is you know what aggravated so or.
11474.0,Patient,"not really I didn't I didn't do anything um you know, maybe Helen sleeping or something but it's not like I even when did a bunch of exercise it feels like it feels like i'm. Like more of my glutes like I get pain in that area, once in a while, but it's my same side the right side. yeah today it's a little better, but yesterday and Sunday, it was horrible."
214.0,Provider,Is it is a pain running up or running down.

214.0,Provider,"I don't know you know see cushion or mobile you know, keep moving your feet it's just it's just the way the nerve gets bent on okay all right yeah I don't think Saturday would have helped to be honest with you. want to cause more frustration. And who needs that okay. So how do you think things are going."
11474.0,Patient,"i'm pretty well, I think that i've been. A little shorten crabby just because I have this underlying. what's the word just not knowing. what's going to happen with these jobs and makes me really anxious just waiting I can't stand it so. it's just not fun."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but it's the flip side worse it's the again I don't want to be this gloom and doom guy but it's a flip side worse if none of them come through."
11474.0,Patient,"um no I mean, I think that trying is better than not. living in misery, if I don't even try as stressful as it is."
214.0,Provider,"I would definitely agree with you. Like, we have to say, we have to do something. In hopes that it turns out to be something right."
11474.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
214.0,Provider,I think that's always good to go um anything with depression or anxiety.
11474.0,Patient,"And i've been tearful the past couple of days um. I think, just because of the pain and just I just have wasn't feeling too good overall um. So the depressions been bad they said the past two days or so."
214.0,Provider,"I won't I won't see that in his score, but your score for your last one that you submitted, which was 1013. Page 298 and 10 these numbers actually better than your pre your previous numbers."
11474.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,Do you think that the medication is it other than what maybe say I could this does do you think the medications have now kind of worked out to the best it can work out.
11474.0,Patient,"I think so, other than I was thinking, the other day that maybe if I had one more to take it like three times a day. morning afternoon and the evening, that that might be a little better. Because I don't know how you know long it really last it is working for sure."
214.0,Provider,"What are you taking just two milligrams. I mean I. The only way chantelle would consider it if you made a one on one and other not you consider, but these are low doses, they are."
11474.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,So I I think it's worth having the conversation it won't work at groups she's gonna tell you make an.
11474.0,Patient,appoint right.
214.0,Provider,"Right, you make an appointment, I think. You know. I mean basically you're here for pain so. I don't know, maybe the idea is it's because she's not a pain prescriber right maybe the idea would maybe to get you over to a pain prescribe. But I don't know if Dr. pat guy can prescribe we were. let's see let's see if you make an appointment let's see what that outcome is and then we'll come up with a strategy after that. Okay, maybe truly King can do it yeah I listen, I think it, I think it could go to for."
11474.0,Patient,"what's the average that people are on I mean obviously i'm not like a meth addict or something, but not stereotype but what's the average people are on usually."
214.0,Provider,"I mean it depends, you know we have people who have the amputees. they've got debilitating diseases. as high as 16. conical lowest i've seen the low side, since he."
11474.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"For an hour for an actual pain patient in a pink monitored by a pink Dr as the minimum. But they won't. They will not go up to 24 year, but they will go up to 16 two leads. But I did I think you know I mean it's it's definitely a 50% increase, but you know what in we kind of talked about this over and over again, I guess, I didn't pay enough attention on paying attention. I guess, I thought this morning to when I looked at him look at it, but, but you should be at a high adults. So we can do is if you're willing to make the appointment. And then, let me know what the outcome is and if it's not satisfied to be you know i'll defer i'll tell the auto Shan talkers I think I said i'll come back to November let's have a lease assessed by pain doctor looked the pain doctor tell us what we think should be."
11474.0,Patient,Okay okay that's fair.
214.0,Provider,"Okay cool cool alright, so our next appointment Islam, oh no next week. So. I don't but Sean tells packed. that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna grab her year before group. And let me see what I can do, I don't I mean you know i'm talking like I I know how this is going to go I."
11474.0,Patient,don't.
214.0,Provider,"I think if I said she needs to go out to eat that's a big REACH, but I think if we're asking to war, you know, two for 424 hour period is very reasonable and it doesn't indicate. Anybody trying to get more than it should right."
11474.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Most people would come here, most people tell us they need 16 to 32 and it's like that's not gonna happen. yeah because they haven't gotten to a place where they can manage it and they're really relying on the medication to do it and then. They have a physical dependency and then we're pretty much shot in the head, so let me work on my end i'll work on your end but i'll definitely see you on the 26 and hopefully we haven't resolved by them."
11474.0,Patient,yeah and I should know some more news by then.
214.0,Provider,"Also, and see if you can get that drug screen."
11474.0,Patient,expedite yeah. i'll call him tomorrow.
