8835.0,Patient,"sitting right here next to me. Fine, I have a question for you. Sure, so the psych meds that i'm taking right now, but have they can have side effects. Then. I don't know if it has to do with the meds or if I am just tapping many strokes, but i'm not remembering things like I guess I put a whole thing a razors in the freezer refrigerator. And she put cookie dough in the pantry and then she was saying, she. Paul she said something like Paul Walker. Facebook anymore, and then she was saying that my worst enemy she's like I have to warn you, your worst enemy like you have to be really carefully it literally felt like she was like having a stroke like or she had like dementia like. I don't know when check your sugar, because my fiance he's a paramedic we check your sugar we checked your blood pressure, it was a little low. But this has been happening this hop this was happening over the last two days I tried to get her to go to the hospital she want it, but I think it's because she was so altered, but it was it was terrifying like she. didn't know what time it was she woke up at one in the morning, I thought it was a time when it was five or she woke up at like 12 and thought it was like six in the morning fed my cat and let him out the foreign rain. And then the other night she started feeding the dogs, thinking it was nighttime and it was 3am and i'm wondering now that won't remember, I told you about that infinite I had had to go to the hospital. Last week."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8835.0,Patient,"Okay, so when I look back on that night I never I didn't remember leaving my house a little different it kinda was diabetic and. It was a little different as just because she was more confused, it may have been a similar experience, but this time it felt like she completely just like I don't remember any of that he doesn't even know what she was saying, like it was I was like crying like I was so scared."
298.0,Provider,"This that this House, this is bigger than, then this is a big deal. This is a big deal, this does not sound like medication this sounds like possible a ti as. You know, a mini stroke going on. something's going on and. it's a transit schema. Attack it's a little tiny baby stroke and and and. I need you to go to your medical doctor and."
8835.0,Patient,i'm waiting for them to call me with a video appointment.
298.0,Provider,anytime okay.
8835.0,Patient,"hi squeeze man. Okay. i'm out. Because your number now yeah. Gas it was really terrifying like I, and then I I felt bad, but I was kind of telling her like hey like this is what you're doing, and she would get I mean, of course, you know I think she was scared she was getting super defensive and. I was trying to make her feel that for it no you weren't making me feel bad I just didn't remember doing anything right so that's why I kept going it was me, but then the more I thought about it this morning and. The stove was on like there was things that were happening that were that were getting dangerous like the stove was on and and there were cat treats in a pan with a. spatula. And it's scary for me like my my biggest fear is like her, her getting dementia and her like something happening there her and her like forgetting me and. I know it's scary for her, and I think that's the biggest part is just her fear that something really bad is going on, but I told her like you need to get checked out. like this isn't funny like and I know she knows that she's finally coming out of it is even this morning, she was like still altar than just acting super often now I think she's finally coming out of it and."
298.0,Provider,Is there any chance the mental been mixed up at all. Nothing.
8835.0,Patient,"No, no, I take I know what i'm supposed to take, and I can I take one bottle out at a time. goes by medication yeah so those those things should be they can be a side effect from one that has it all been right."
298.0,Provider,"So I have you on 80 milligrams of the lead to de, which is an Anti psychotic. it's possible but not probable that you're having a reaction to it, what we. could try to do is, if you don't come out of this within the next day cut the tablet and bath. and see if. The lead today. causing some misfiring in your brain."
8835.0,Patient,But without all the sudden. We are.
298.0,Provider,not really um but you know what they always say rapid onset dementia is rare like it don't it's very rare most likely it's a medication like usually is a medication problem.
8835.0,Patient,"or it's so so you're saying, and this could be a medical yeah that's what she's thinking just like this morning or night opened up the fridge I saw a box of razors and refrigerator right. What did he put us in the hair, and I mean I took them out to. take them out, I don't ever put she put cookie dough. pantry I don't remember doing that I don't remember putting catch reaching the farm down I don't I don't remember any of this."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I need you to get a medical evaluation and take your meds and and see if they can rule out what is going on."
8835.0,Patient,Because I.
298.0,Provider,Just unusual.
8835.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, you know he he had parkinson's and, ultimately, he ended up dying from a stroke, but the thing is, I know enough to know that. You know this happens in threes and if you don't get you know, on board or something. who have a bigger stroke on I guess the reason I kept telling my kid that I was fine because, in my mind I didn't do it, I didn't put that little prayer you know, like what are you talking about Ali your phrase. But the more I thought about it in some of the things I haven't told her if I had to guess thoughts or I would probably say the other day you forgot how to get home, I did. And like if I want to get something out of the fridge Oh, I want to go get some help, for example. And I walked over and open it and then sometimes i'm not remembering, but I think part of it may have to do with her ADHD as well, because I have ADHD to and obviously it's like not like that so. Sometimes i'll be going to do something and i'll completely forgot what i'm doing. So I think it may not all be medical, of course, I think this may be, medical, but as far as like the little I mean it may not, it may be, but you also have ADHD and that can cause like you know you to get distracted. memory stuff like that, as well, no, I agree, and you know one thing, though she was like i've been. Like triple time the stress dollar gotta walk or I remember, I was telling you so the one the one thing that we get it all in remember I, I wonder, I wonder, still take I want to take adderall, but I want to lower it back to 10. And then take it. For a month and then see if everything's hunky dory and I don't either adderall she's a lot more focused i've noticed that, and I think when she's off of it is when. It does i've noticed, I mean like I said I don't know if that is a medical reason but, like, I think, part of it is her ADHD like she's very distracted, which is very hard to concentrate, even in the conversation oh my cutting people are all over the map like thought."
298.0,Provider,"Okay well why don't we do that. Why, I mean it wouldn't hurt if you've got something else going on it'll still be there and the outer role is not going to cover it so let's lower the dose of the adderall, what do you want to take 10 milligrams in the morning 30 milligrams."
8835.0,Patient,"goes, you can always go slow and then we can you can always raise it it's better if 10 milligrams well enough to notice now, what about 15."
298.0,Provider,I I would recommend more like 20 we had you on 60.
8835.0,Patient,"Okay, so all right wonderful alley but what about like what about like excellent like an extended release, do you think."

My whole body was shaking I was sweating I mean the whole bit I mean it was kind of I was like what the hell i'm not that without on to some days it makes me really focused and calm. Other days it like it, why don't take any more obviously but I wouldn't wire like it was really hit or miss for new without all just concert it out so admirals a stimulant is concerted thinks the same way."

I don't feel like that I don't feel hungry all when i'm on real future I started that will mix it all, and like I said, the second phase of it, I was starving like I noticed a huge difference."

So on you know to and I noticed you Alex helps me a lot it gets really bad anxiety attacks and that really helps calm her down, at least, and if you aren't you feel like if she's feeling. jittery on the outer, all I can she take like a xanax to kind of help calm or don't like you can take."
298.0,Provider,"That good. It could, but it's not a good idea, but definitely once an upper and once a downer hopefully you won't have that we cut the dosage in half, and hopefully. But i'm still have the opinion to get a workup done to see why you were."
