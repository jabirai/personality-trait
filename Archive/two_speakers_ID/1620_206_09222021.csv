206.0,Provider,"So, why would he take facing."
1620.0,Patient,"Well, if he drinks again i'm gonna you know, then I guess, I have to leave, but the problem is is I have nowhere to go and i'm not going to a homeless shelter. You know I refuse, I mean i'm not doing that, so you know it's like i've been trying to figure something out i've been talking to my son about possibly say seeing, if I can move in with him for a while pay him son, you know, give them some money towards the bills and what. Tyler."
206.0,Provider,doesn't happen to.

206.0,Provider,face.
1620.0,Patient,"Right exactly so um you know. I don't know what i'll do if he drinks, again, I honestly because, like I said I don't know where I where I would go I really don't at this point so."
206.0,Provider,So let's not stop him from drinking again.
1620.0,Patient,"I don't know when you'll be awfully he believes me that you know i'm done and if he drink some gone, I mean he's he's under the i've let let him believe that I have options, you know. So hopefully with him thinking that you know, but who knows you know i've heard he's not going to drink before, and he has so we'll just have to see how it goes, you know. He has been drank since this happened, but then again, you know look, I still have the bruise so you know once that's gone, who knows I don't know I don't know what's going to happen it's just you know it's it's a messed up situation I just you know. I really don't I know I need to get I need to leave but. it's like when you don't have any I don't have the finances to be able to live on my own only gets 794 a month, you know, and I don't have anywhere, you know i've been looking for some type of like timeline you know for like."
206.0,Provider,A roommate type of situation.
1620.0,Patient,"You know so i've been looking into that but, so far, you know nothing's panned out. You know i'm. Also, you know I mean we're we're still looking for something else, we have a place to see tomorrow i'm thinking, maybe if we're in a place with I have more options to get away from him, you know it that'd be a little bit better as well."
206.0,Provider,But you are in a placement for and saw the had some.
1620.0,Patient,yeah I know.
206.0,Provider,Something going on.
1620.0,Patient,"That was like yeah but I don't know that was a little bit different i'm very small very wasn't many options as to you know where I could go to get away from them. But um I mean this hasn't happened in a very long time is Paris is drunk i'm not making excuses for him i'm just saying you know it's been a long time since he's gotten that drunk and that, just like wow but."
206.0,Provider,"Did he say what happened, why the change out of the sudden."
1620.0,Patient,"No, no, you just."
206.0,Provider,Have you guys discuss insulin.
1620.0,Patient,Is he what.
206.0,Provider,Have you guys discuss the incident because.
1620.0,Patient,"I bring it up all the time doing, but he really doesn't have too much to say about it, you know you just you know I don't know if it's because he feels bad or. If it's just I don't know he really doesn't have too much to say about it, he just tells me, you know that he's he's done drinking, you know, and you know that's about all he says about it so. You know, and the fact that you know he wouldn't hurt me on purpose, you know, it was an accident, and you know which I do believe, and if it wasn't I would say, because before when he has gotten physical lets me I have you know which was years and years ago. But um. i've been truthful about it, so you know I if I really thought it was intentional, I mean it shouldn't have happened regardless, you know I mean but i'm just saying you know it wasn't like you know. He he tension only did it. But nonetheless it doesn't change, you know i'm just sick to death of the whole situation. And then now tyler's in the hospital. He. broke. He broke his foot bone in his foot and the people gave them the wrong size, they were putting them in a boot you know, one of those boot you know things and they gave him the wrong size, it was like two sizes too small, and from wearing it ended up causing like an ulcer. yeah which then now he's got a really bad infection he's in the hospital on IV antibiotics. yeah so. He had an MRI today, and from what they could see it didn't look like the infection had gotten to the bone. So that's good. and his blood work that they repeated looked a little bit better, so it looks like danna biotics might you know be worth doing that you know you know clearing up the infection So hopefully you know. it'll get taken care of but it's just you know this, the he just can never catch a break, you know he's."
206.0,Provider,And he sees his foot.
1620.0,Patient,yeah well he's got I don't know if you ever heard of cmt.
206.0,Provider,Is it something that it's. it's something.
1620.0,Patient,"you're born with it it's a genetic disorder. it's like effects like your peripheral like your nerve. nervous system. Tasks like the nerves like his feet are shaped or he said, like many surgeries. You know yeah. he's he'll colbert's he said they had the you know extensions on those when he was. younger, you know quarter sentient that then at back then they thought he had cerebral palsy you know when he was younger. But then, as he got older they really you know realized, it was this, I still think he had some of you know a little bit of that as well, but bottom line, this is the main thing that he you know he has and. So he can easily is things like that can easily happen to him, you know, like where he wasn't even aware that he you know bro you know stress fracture the bone and it's funny. You know I mean when it additionally happened it wasn't till his foot swelled up like a balloon and then you know, then, then it just went from there, so. So."
206.0,Provider,Good I. went when when did he get this church.
1620.0,Patient,"Well, if there's blood layoffs you know, keep coming back better hold maybe tomorrow, maybe. You know they'll have to wait and see so."
206.0,Provider,How many of you in the hospital.
1620.0,Patient,he's been in there since yesterday.
206.0,Provider,"Okay, so anybody allowed to visit him."
1620.0,Patient,"No, no they're only allow one. person that brought brought him just to visit. So, and that was marine his stepmother so. yeah otherwise no I would I would have I had intended on going to the you know the hospital meeting them there, but with covert and everything."
206.0,Provider,and restrictions yeah yeah so. So you talk with them a little Hong us.
1620.0,Patient,"Yes, any texts, you know we talk he texted me keeps me updated what's going on, you know you know so it's just but you know i'm just it just worries me, because you know he's got this job where he's doing security where it's got to be honest, feed a lot. And it's just you know if he. loses his job he's in big trouble because not only is you know if you lose your job you have no income, but they also discount is a part of the. perk of the job is he gets a discount on this apartment and if that goes away you'll never be able to afford you know what that apartment actually costs without the discount you know. I see so."
206.0,Provider,"Well, I know point I walk with them, because this is something an ankle injury they eat in all about so. Right, you have a medical condition that you have to take out maybe they'll take that into consideration."
1620.0,Patient,"I hope so, you know I mean. I really do so, I mean that's got me worried obviously you know, like you know it's just it just been one thing from another he just says not been a very good, you know, last you know, two weeks it's just."
206.0,Provider,"And, with all that going on, have you had any. any thought of using our news at all."
1620.0,Patient,"um a couple times, but you know I did what I usually do I sit, you know, I think it through you know I think yeah you use once once turns into you know, two to three, and then the next thing you know and then yeah that puts it out of my mind, you know. it's not worth it's not worth it. he's not worth not Tyler i'm talking about here, you know. it's Carlos you know it's losing my sobriety over, no, no, no, nothing major anything that I, you know, like I said didn't nip in the bud as soon as it entered my mind, you know for a second so. i'm not real concerned about that i'm just taking one day at a time, you know. So I can do. At the moment, you know."
206.0,Provider,"that's a lot when in the environment is could be on unhealthy relationship so that creates stress for you, and of course the individual."
1620.0,Patient,"yeah sure does it's just like that, and just tired i'm just tired of it, you know I don't want any drinking I don't want i'm done with it, I don't want any more, I mean enough's enough, you know. And if you can't do that Well then, I guess, then drinking is more important than me and then I don't know i'll have to just figure something out I want I don't know but i'll have to figure something out because I can't do it anymore I just can't I just enough's enough, you know."
206.0,Provider,So anybody else in your family knows about what's going on with.
1620.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah my mom knows actually you know she knows my my did my stepfather knows my brother knows you know they know."
206.0,Provider,Hand wanted a sandwich.
1620.0,Patient,"Well, but I need to get away from them, but you know. i'm still you know she knows I have nowhere to go. The most i've been offered as far as their over there, goes as I can go there for a couple days. Well, what does that solve you know I mean it's better than nothing, I guess, if, like."
206.0,Provider,"You know, some some distance between combat. yeah."
1620.0,Patient,"So coming back to this, you know same you know situation you know just like moving I mean yeah it might be better than being here, but you know it's still moving with him, so you know it's just. it's not solving the problem you know because I mean. I don't I don't know if I don't really know if I have much faith in the whole i'm not going to drink anymore, you know saying, because i've heard that too many other times you know. It last for so long, and then it ends up going back to you know oh i'll just a couple, and you know it just so we'll see I mean I you never know. You never know but i'm just going by the past, you know past, obviously I mean he did quit once for over a year, you know long time, but I think I told you about that you know. me that that's when he started going to counseling and."
206.0,Provider,"When he hasn't done that, for a while, getting."
1620.0,Patient,"treatment, and so you know. And I am. You know I asked him I said, do you do you think you need me don't you think maybe you need some help with this, you know it, but he's in says no, you know he can do it, you know he doesn't need help so. You know. What it is."
206.0,Provider,So you still planning to move. With them.
1620.0,Patient,"Until I can figure, you know, unless something else you know where i'm able to figure something else out but I mean otherwise yeah I really I mean what other choice Do I really have."
206.0,Provider,"Now, because I mentioned looking for roommates and subside I wasn't sure."
1620.0,Patient,"No i'm still looking for. That and if I do find it out, I will I will go. You know, but it just right now that's just not an option, so you know. I mean I I don't feel unsafe, I know that you know or anything like that, and I mean if I really did you know I would leave, and I would go to my mother's you know. And then just see how it goes from there, you know whether it's a couple days or maybe I could you know who knows couple days could turn into more you never know. You know I mean. With them, so I mean i'm not going to allow myself to be in an unsafe situation you know. As far as that so."
206.0,Provider,"Make sure, and if you do feel unsafe, to use your resources so you're not in a situation where you get in. it's getting violent or you can be physically hurt."
