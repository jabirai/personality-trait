1045.0,Patient,"So imagine it's a pastor sorry um this plastic thing they put up inside you to hold your bladder up they teach you how to do it yourself and stuff. And when I went to my original appointment they had to run a bunch of tests and do some. don't tell you it's something day just kind of grasp it always hurts like hell and then she sent me purposes, Sarah and show me how to use it and everything else. And it was a temporary and then she gave me a permanent because you want me to try the temporary for two weeks after that permanent in and. It hurt really bad like later that day, and so I just sitting so they try and drive home in the car and everything I was in pain and stuff and because, in my back really bags, I have, I have a two. discs that disc semi right side. Now for now five or something like that so anyways it was really killing my back and Stephen. You know, and then they said oh that's normal and stuff like that, because putting pressure on your back until you get used to in this and then we'll then. I got really sick and it came out on its own, I was in work came out and i'm still sick from it and I don't know if it's just this or this on top of it but well, I was afraid of, and what they want to check me make sure I have toxic tss. From Tampa because by that too. And I don't, but I do have an affection, right now, from it, I cause an infection and so. i'm on. Antibiotics for that and body rejected is what it did, but you know I looked at this is where I knew look things up before before I had a time because. I was kind of mad at myself I didn't usually i'm pretty good at that, but it may sound like Okay, this would be a temporary fix so you have surgery, which probably January, February."

Hard hard rubber. hard to make the taco out of it because it like to pop open really hurts when it does. So it's not soft by any means. Oh so um anyways I looked it up afterwards, like people who done the necessary and stuff like that, and if they like said, out of women 247 women over 56% have issues with it. and causing and dusted the material it's major or just. I can see, it would be because it's hard it's hard you know. So, like you know, like hurts yeah my bags you pushing us so far back that literally. Pushing into your back area, and when you sit in everything it's kind of like rough rubber so it's like scratching you up in the inside a little bit, and then I started doing i'm still doing it right now is the hot cold sweats hot cold sweats.

Like well sorry we're there so much it's like we've got the you know red line to the emergency room."
1045.0,Patient,"yeah it has it's as good as bad, but usually, when they're little because Connor who's born. Because bill corr tighter than not so he had problems with one of his lungs, so he was always at the er when he was little and then it went to call him because colton was always had croup so it was haven't taken the hospital for that. i'll use constant really bad he still gets brought to this day, if not they'll get it. don't actually grow completely out of it.

126.0,Provider,"And my trip to the hospital was when my kids were older, so my daughter JASMINE who's 30 now 35 actually she dislocated her shoulder five times. Five times in the after the fifth time I said you guys are gonna have to do some kind of surgery this ridiculous we've been coming back here every month for five months because all she had to do is like go like this and her shoulder would get disallow."
1045.0,Patient,Oh yeah swimming.
126.0,Provider,or dancing and her shoulder we get dislocated. yeah. She was getting ready to go off to college i'm like. You guys have to do some kind of surgery now I had to pitch a bitch to Kaiser until they finally said okay.
1045.0,Patient,"Which is ridiculous, because in the long run it costs more I would think her y'all. yeah."
126.0,Provider,"You think it yeah you think it's more. Efficient for me to come in, once a month for you and here's the thing they would have to conquer out to put her shoulder back in place. And then she would be like oh God took her a long time the Anastasia was like not her friend. But one doctor one doctor stood next to her and was talking to her and started going like this, and she goes to her room okay you're going to hear a little clip. click and my daughter is like oh my God you just put it back into place, I said, could you please show me how to do that she goes no you're not a doctor. But all the other times they had to give her a shot knocker up put it back in place."
1045.0,Patient,"it's only they're doing it in a more of a rough manner and stuff like that, because I never as soon as you said that I. Left arm was wrestling with the ex of mine, and I was on the ground, you hear me by my right arm and you're trying to pull me like pull me around much longer was caught on the rug and my shoulder dislocated I remember my friend cherry screaming so loud, as you heard that pop in America."
126.0,Provider,And then your bone sticking out of your back you know.
1045.0,Patient,"yeah it's so weird but then. i've got my shoulder dislocated a lot, too, and they never I mean they never drugged me better hurt like how, when they did it they're like oh God, you know they weren't essential but I never got any drugs."
126.0,Provider,"I don't know why, but they yeah they. They they only one doctor put it back without honking around."
1045.0,Patient,"that's good she had surgery, because I still have to watch I didn't know about that easily, but if I didn't think relax 40 answer I mean certain things will pop my shoulder out to be careful with your current exercises I do are doing too far with his arms it'll snap back out again so. yeah it was crazy but not not that much like five times like once a month like once every like six months, maybe. Once a."
126.0,Provider,"Nicholas it was like. November, December January, February, March, and she was getting ready to go off to college. yeah in August, so it was like I can't just let her go and cross my fingers that you'll not dislocate your shoulder again, which she did, even after the surgery."
1045.0,Patient,"As you done since, after that, or is that chills I."
126.0,Provider,"Know Kaiser did old school kind of surgery on her and she had a huge scar right here. And then, when she went away to school. And I think if she got a job doing something that job covered she had again. Not place yeah. And so, when when the new place up in Chico that's where she went to school when they looked at, they said Oh, this is really an old school operation, you need arthroscopic surgery, where we just poke a thing in we just leaves one hole and we fix the whole thing they fixed it. They said with Kaiser did was crap."
1045.0,Patient,Total crap with a nasty scar afterwards.
126.0,Provider,yeah huge scar yeah.
1045.0,Patient,"And sometimes there's a just for my sister she had she has a bad Stacy Kathy and I all have have similar issues stacy's is the worst and she end up having surgery on her back and they put a metal rod in her bag. yeah and she's had that she had surgery, we found out she got really big all sudden like. Not in a mean way because it's like I was it was just her stomach it was weird like everywhere else in the face, then leg she's got chicken legs. I mean just you know but her stomach just got really big it was weird you know, and she found we get these massive backbend together before she had surgery on her back and they found it took a good year and a half, they found a tumor or seven was the size of a three month old baby. Luckily, it was benign I know I can't believe how huge it was when I came out, it was oh."
126.0,Provider,My God.
1045.0,Patient,yeah that the whole time.
126.0,Provider,Just comfort that whole time.
1045.0,Patient,"Oh, she was always been a hospital, but they never did X rays on our stomach or anything like that no chicken year and half they'll finally somebody did the right X Ray or whether they did. And figured it out, or like I said that's why it grew so big because it was inner for so long, it was it was pushing into her back and all that, and she finally had that removed the poor thing like. Until you show me Eric scars whoever did the surgery on her stomach was like Frankenstein the way she's ripped apart. Larger so nasty and same with her back from the metal rod so front her front side, all the way through our backsides just looks like like she's been just torn apart and put back together is horrible stitches I mean horrible scars and God, you know. I can't believe how bad it looks like. No, and I said, with my stomach when Adam I was having problems my gallbladder and nobody would believe me, I couldn't eat I can eat anything I threw up every single time and i'd have this pain and it was weird I described as like under is like I could feel like inside me. And I. tested my gallbladder says the line it's fine it's fine and, finally, one that guys, I want you to test me and he wasn't a doctor, but do not say I told you this she goes but. My son had the same issue and kind of find out he didn't have gallstones but his gallbladder was diseased and the only way to find that, as they had to put some kind of like an. injection like or die injection in you and I had to fight tooth and nail to get that and once. I had that done they took me in for emergency surgery, because it was fully diseased and when they cut me open it didn't just use my gallbladder it started to move to other parts. I was told I was only going to have like three little laparoscopy meetings and I came out and I slipped under my stomach like I had baby."
126.0,Provider,got asked.
1045.0,Patient,"me to slip up higher and then another split on the other side, like not little cuts like slits."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
1045.0,Patient,"I was remember coming out of surgery and they're really me back to my room like what. Is it what happened because I was just all cut up to like couldn't move or anything like that, and I remember later that day this. Male nurse or think was new instead of how to use the restroom is here, let me help you out well, they said we get getting up really careful because of where my stitches for. His hand and pulled me up really fast. and opened up my stitches in my stomach below and. everywhere and i've ever like is like either, because I was there for over a week. Or the following day, or the day after, whatever that guy years came back in I like you're not judging me get out of there. I don't want you. yeah so I have nasty scars all over my eyes and my belly button Center part some together now to instead of like something inside where he first went in with the. left the. Whatever camera they have messed up, and so my belly button literally together, so I no longer have a belly or it's like really funky looking."
126.0,Provider,That is crazy.
1045.0,Patient,yeah but it's also reading we don't have the best doctors or hospitals.
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
1045.0,Patient,"So by me, thank God, they found it and they can nap because that was the where I now have any probably know a lot of people after having the gallbladder out they get sick or not he got totally change their eating habits. yeah i've never had a problem sense. Yes, that doesn't bother me anymore. So I was just like think Bob has gone."
126.0,Provider,"yeah when I had my C section 30 years ago and the doctor came in two days later, with a staple remover. Oh, and I said what's that, for he goes i'm taking out your staples I said what staples staples we put in after your C section what the Fuck. And he goes to you know kind of lift up my gown and then tears off. That hurt worse than taking the staples out is when he took he, like there was 12 staples and taking them out didn't hurt as much as tearing the adhesive on the bandage."
1045.0,Patient,She said.
126.0,Provider,"And then I said oh you're taking them out so soon it's only been two days ago, oh no everything's all yield. I felt like when I first took a shower I had to hold my stomach I was like my stomach's going to follow. yeah how could it be healed in two days. bias is."

So I remember. i'm with kyle I didn't list got size. 42 F breast some very big breasted and thanks to my grandma and so um every everybody as my family actually my little my sister who's like the little teeny tiny one she's freaking like double d's. So um anyways I remember, after having kyle I camera was a hot or cold I think you're not supposed to use cold water it stimulates it or hot where I can remember what you just said, I can't breastfeed I never could with my kids I just try to get the classroom out and then. Oh, and it hurt didn't know I smelled up so bad. thing and i'm like I get an opposite of what they told me to do I can't remember which one it was but. I remember social and it was in so much pain from that. It took like four foot down. Like holy crap nurses were coming in and."
126.0,Provider,squeezing to get the colostrum out.
1045.0,Patient,yeah that's.
126.0,Provider,"Like hard as a rock and and I did breastfeed but it's that first beginning, you know if you don't immediately put the baby on your nipple it's just going to get harder and. Oh, my God, they would come in and put warm blooded warm like diapers on me and then come in and for us. get it all out."
1045.0,Patient,"Thank God, they have those things now or the the pumps. nurse do."
126.0,Provider,"You know that in itself was making me think like I never want to have a kid again this is. This is frickin torture and then I did it again and I said Why did I do this because it the same exact thing happened. yeah me. I was in Labor for 42 hours. You see, section."
1045.0,Patient,"don't do that the way to the very last minute to do that, I think i've Pittsburgh damage on the child when they do that I think it's a stupid."
126.0,Provider,"Well then, my daughter end up being born with you know hyperactivity attention deficit so dearly. She had to be on you know Ritalin the whole time she was in school, she had to be tutored she was dyslexic she was oppositional be I mean every single kind of behavior we did behavioral modification with her, we did. Occupational therapy, we did we did so many things. To try to figure out how can we can calm this child down and. yeah I think nothing we get help, the only thing that helped was a good one."
1045.0,Patient,Okay i've been something that gave you at the hospital the time to that might have caused.
126.0,Provider,That could have been too.
1045.0,Patient,"Because my sister she was born my oldest sister was born in Texas, and they gave my mom something and it knocked my mom out and then actually where Kathy was born she didn't actually wake up for two days the baby. And she's had a little bit of damage from that she's a little slow. And, and they found out like nine a year later that drug was that they used was. Like FDA not proved anymore, or whatever, because it can damage they put on it can damage babies and even the moment. So my dad scared because there's their first child and my mom's out, so the baby and nobody's waking up."
126.0,Provider,Right that's scary yeah.
1045.0,Patient,"So she's always been a little slow when she's a teacher and she's smart and stuff but just everything that tastes maybe like somebody is a little bit easier for them to do is about twice as hard for her to do. Now she's always had a hard time with things like that now just because the medicine that they gave her, and that was back then I don't. Especially even nowadays they give you stuff like I remember that I kept saying you can't have the epidural till you're like. If you're so far along in CAD Abdul now that you have at any point time it's like the always changing finger adding new things and that's kind of scary you don't know what's gonna you know that's gonna hurt you or it's gonna hurt me hear what you know."
126.0,Provider,"yep yep yep. that's I remember some drugs that they were talking about several years ago that they had given to a lot of pregnant women, and it was it was not a good drug."
1045.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I used to date, this one, it wasn't Mike again it was another version of it, I maximal that is much more minor version mind like you can go to work with it and stuff it just just kind of like a backflip in or something just kind of helped ease off pain. I was having back problems, and all I do is sit in a desk my back was killing me I was a lot I can't remember it anyways. And being taken out the shelf and I started seeing all these commercials if you have been but remember it has all these symptoms i'm like Oh, I took that for like two years."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God. So I, like my gums I I keep your eye off that's it sorry. Oh, I keep hearing with this one medication that isn't it weird any way that they advertise medication on TV."
1045.0,Patient,"Oh, I know."
126.0,Provider,"asked for, but they didn't used to do that."
1045.0,Patient,"I know. That so for a lot of them are worse than what than being prescribed for like one of them was of them, but eating and then it's like could cause cancer like that's way worse. Writing one."
126.0,Provider,"Well, so one of them that description is so long, of all the things that can cause, but one particular description they actually put along the bottom of the commercial they explain it. So it says, along with 50 other bad side effects it can also cause the parents need to have an infection and like get boils or something and then along the bottom of the screen, it says the parent medium is the spot between the genitals and the anus."
1045.0,Patient,Oh yay.
126.0,Provider,can draw me that their parents me i'm. gonna get infected. ever heard of apparently and.
1045.0,Patient,"I never you know what that was, but he said I was going to ask what's her name. there's one other joke around about but on a it was on the tonight shows or whatever, but I actually looked it up, and it does say it on there as can cause anal leakage. And it's like I want to take that yeah."
126.0,Provider,Do they have pads for that.
1045.0,Patient,grows when I read that. Number one check back.
126.0,Provider,Give me something else that that is not the side effect and when they start naming like 2530 side effects. Do I really need to take this drug I mean it sounds.
1045.0,Patient,"When they say it so quickly, because you know it's kind of like they're trying to get over your head there's a little bit really bad. You know cat one here and there, you know, like I said else I can show you the DEMO cancer like caught it really quick when they said that you. know you know we're trying to hide side effects. he's in."
126.0,Provider,"All right, Lady well i'm gonna let you go. And I love see I."
