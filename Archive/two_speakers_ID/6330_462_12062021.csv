462.0,Provider,"i'm doing good, how are you. Good how's everything been going with you over the past couple weeks."
6330.0,Patient,"pretty good had a little trouble hearing their first it was the bank somebody hacked me. yeah I went to go, make sure there was enough money in there for my appointment last week and that's the only reason I even knew what happened because I was like $200 in the hole and i'm like well."
462.0,Provider,So yeah the Bank and straighten all.
6330.0,Patient,That out and get new cards and we said every password.
462.0,Provider,I thought always just so stressful and so invasive you know you. it's hard for your own.
6330.0,Patient,Right and why don't you steal money from somebody that has a lot not me i'm.
462.0,Provider,I hear you I hear you like go for a bank account that has a big balance not.
6330.0,Patient,Not barely hundreds.
462.0,Provider,"yeah no it's that's just horrible i'm sorry, you had to go through that and then like you said you can't do the session and so were you able to get reimbursed for the fraud."
6330.0,Patient,"For most of it so far we filed I had to go into the Bank and go through everything, because I have so many automatic withdrawals. And then I have everything else setups through my email and that's how they hacked me and got all my information so we're not even sure it's completely done but we're hoping so but there's. Just a couple of things that i've found the dispute on that I actually haven't got the money back for you, so what isn't too bad. But yeah."
462.0,Provider,I had to go.
6330.0,Patient,reset everything all my passwords and everything and just.
462.0,Provider,Another worst part is just having to spend so much time on that it's stressful and. Oh really you're hoping they're not getting further into hacking something right.
6330.0,Patient,"Right so yeah no I sat down with a lady today, she was super nice about it. And we went through and. You know I told her which ones were my normal, these are the ones that you know, and I paid through PayPal for everything, so if it didn't come through PayPal That was a first sign. Just him all right, and so yeah so I have like I said I have automatic like, for my life insurance my car insurance think about oh just come out automatically on the six or fifth of every."
462.0,Provider,Month stress every month yep.
6330.0,Patient,"yeah and then you know I just everything else, I pay over the phone to I use my Internet so I keep all my stuff on my phone and they wiped my phone out they took my contacts, they took me emails they took everything, and I was like what's going on with my phone I thought it was. Just the phone. You know I didn't know people. could do that to you. it's such a scary thought when you think about it because I mean it's easier to pay your bills online and do it that way, and have everything you know right on your phone, so you don't have to remember anything. Right and again it gives everybody that information and get smarter."
462.0,Provider,To do what access right. yeah just just a tough thing it's.
6330.0,Patient,unfortunate that it would do that and around Christmas time it's not a nice.
462.0,Provider,"happen everybody's got extra bills. To pay for and like you said you can see, in your account that there's not much there anyway so."
6330.0,Patient,yeah right.
462.0,Provider,Right.
6330.0,Patient,"Family and i'll do more ya. yeah and like well, but the scariest thing was for me is like all my credit card information is you know I have my. card that goes with my bank account, and I also have like walmart and target and other credit cards that Thank God i've maxed them out this month already for Christmas present, so they couldn't get far with them. But just a pain to go back through and reset everything and change your passwords and."
462.0,Provider,yeah it sure is but you're doing it that's good and. Tom really nothing else you can do right other know try to. Keep your stuff secure and.
6330.0,Patient,"Writing it would be nice to know who did it, though, you know who are you."
462.0,Provider,"And I. know it would be nice. No, no i'm sure there's just it might be someone at a different country you really never know."
6330.0,Patient,"that's more more than likely what it is and something to do with their IP address is goes to another one or something like that, so you can't even track them."
462.0,Provider,"yeah these are bad because. Like you said it'd be nice to just be able to give your perspective to some people, and say hey i'm just trying to get through the Christmas season here and. Right. you're driving me."
6330.0,Patient,yeah yeah so that's been a good ongoing project for over a week now.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's. yeah how have you been dealing with the stress of that and you've been doing any self care."
6330.0,Patient,"Well yeah I had one day, where I just screamed and hollered morning because of that, you know, like why me why is it."
462.0,Provider,You know what sometimes that's needed sometimes a little. Writing session is helpful.
6330.0,Patient,"My poor boyfriend though had to listen to me all morning, but you know, because my last name used to be Ross so. When I was married before and I changed my name back way after I got divorced to brown because there was another Julie Russell in town and she was always stealing my ID she's still child support she even. letter. or all letter taken out with my insurance."

6330.0,Patient,"Oh that's I mean it seems like they just target me. I just feel like i've got this X on my back and she's a good one let's go after her. So yeah I just went had a meltdown I basically just melted down over and then you know went to the bank got everything straightened around and I felt better and then I was like i'm sorry I just I don't try not to freak out. You know, because in the past, when I was doing drugs that's exactly what I do is freak. Right and it's nobody's fault, other than. You know my maybe because I have all that information stored on my phone which I definitely."
462.0,Provider,"can't blame yourself it's it's a learning process and honestly technology is changing all the time you really can't blame yourself having a freak out doesn't do anything having a bit of a venting session is okay, I do think that that's healthy to just talk to someone like your. boyfriend and just let it let it rip for a little while and then say all right. i'm move on."
6330.0,Patient,"What are you doing I got all the kids Christmas presents Emma grants for birthday present in the crib over here and I got a cat in here, I have no idea what he's trying to do. My Christmas tree falls off."

6330.0,Patient,yeah do you think maybe if I did embrace it maybe i'd start.
462.0,Provider,"Rather than just kind of fighting it and shaming yourself, for it, maybe a goal can be for you to just kind of given to the crying and embrace it a bit."
6330.0,Patient,yeah okay anything that will make it go away.
462.0,Provider,"I can be a start like maybe next time you say oh. i'm so happy to be crying right now, because. It means I you know it shows how much love you have in this lifetime, or something like that."
6330.0,Patient,"Right, I mean did love him a lot, I mean he was a pain in the ass he really was but I loved him to you know what do you mean we had good memories, not just bad ones. We had he had a lot of problems with mental illness and it was hard, and it was challenging and I did do the best that I could you know I tried. I mean, he wasn't counseling from the time he was like two or three years old, so I did try tried to help them, I mean they're just I think when someone's minds like that. I know, at times, it would be like, no matter what I said it would be an argument and if I agreed with him, it would still be an argument. Do you know what I mean it was that."
462.0,Provider,"kind of there was just nothing more, you can do you did a lot like you said you. counseling and."
6330.0,Patient,"that's right. I mean I, at the end there, I was getting up the crack of dawn and going to find him wherever he would be to get him to his appointment, so he could get off the drugs, you know. But if he didn't want to do it, there really wasn't much I could. Do I mean I tried I got him to Well he missed a couple, and then they threw him out of the clinic. And I had talked him into join in bright heart health I said because it's on your phone. You don't have to worry about can to appointment is great there and I just yeah and then he ended up in the hospital so yeah."
462.0,Provider,"But you can it wasn't around. and think about your own addiction and. they're wrong nobody that could have done anything for you, except yourself, when you are truly ready and you. And you know that we've talked. Exactly you know."
6330.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly you know, and I knew he weren't ready and I don't know if he was ever going to be, you know. I mean he's just I mean he tried he tried, he was in so many different programs, and he tried, but just seems like he said he get to that three or four months mark and he had blow up nice well you got to figure out while you're doing that you know and only you can figure that out. They really think his mental illness. made it more challenging for him."
462.0,Provider,It sure does not. it's a lot of more odds stacked against someone when they have the many different factors dual diagnosis addiction and mental health.
6330.0,Patient,"Right right and then he had so many different mental health diagnosis i'm not sure which ones were accurate, but I just knew I never met a kid like him before I. knew I babysat a lot of kids to grow it up, it. I never met one quite like him. But you know i'm hoping, you know that Christmas will, where I have my grandchildren to focus on in jeff's you know grandchildren are mine, too, as far as i'm concerned, you know. we've been together so long, but we've been together since before either one of us had grandchildren so. You know, I think, focusing on them helps me a lot because."
462.0,Provider,I cannot do for them.
6330.0,Patient,"What I used to do for josh josh and I was. josh and I never went a day without talking and if we did i'd have to call him find out what was wrong. You know what I mean. So i've been hyper focus in on them a little bit, and I think that helps me a lot. You know."
462.0,Provider,Does it gives you a place to put your love when. Someone passes it's like you have nowhere to put it it's just kind of stuck but this gives you a nother place to.
6330.0,Patient,"To put it right right, and you know, like losing my mother, the year before I just I felt empty, you know really empty for a while. I met her justice much you know your mother you do everything growing."
462.0,Provider,"was just huge huge losses for you. So it's. Time to take it slow and. Just let the holiday season be what it's going to be for you try to embrace a little bit, but try to embrace the crying if you can but, if not. just trying to get through it and."
6330.0,Patient,i'm going to try.
462.0,Provider,Leaving on others if you need to.
6330.0,Patient,"write I tried not to focus on it, I try to keep myself focused on other things."
462.0,Provider,yeah and you're great at that you're really good at coping and you have you been still continuing with your exercise yoga.
6330.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i've been. Oh, my gosh i'm kind of going overboard so I had to take a couple days off because. Your muscles feel and yeah cuz. we're four weeks without taking a day off and i'm like. i'm saying it was I wanted to. But then I do it anyway. Right, I did I felt so good, after the weekend I just took the weekend whole weekend off, I felt good my body felt, you know so much. Better again because I read an article, where it says, if you exercise every day you get little tears in your muscles. And that that's why you need them days of breath. And sometimes it's more than one and. You can you're the only person that really can tell this your body, but you absolutely need to take at least 24 hours off."
462.0,Provider,"Yes, so I say."
6330.0,Patient,"So, yes I gotta do."
462.0,Provider,"yeah yes i'm trying to need to do that, once a week."
6330.0,Patient,"Right, because I do like yoga in the morning but i've kept my yoga back to like six poses and maybe a little weight in there. But I do a Cardio and zoom by every night. So that's where I. needed to take a little break because that takes a lot out of your body. Really, but I sleep good."
462.0,Provider,"Then that right, there is the truest statement I always tell people with sleeping problems with exercise helps, so much so. doing all the amazing things you're doing, but of course remember to rest because that's. All so it helps balance your emotions as well, actually helps just keep your nervous system settled and keeps you feeling a little bit more steady good sleep helps everything so. You know, again we'll keep your goal is maintaining maybe another goal of just trying to embrace the crying and some of the grief a little bit is there anything else that you'd like to establish is the goal this week."
6330.0,Patient,"No. No, no, no. Okay, I think I got so many appointments this week."
462.0,Provider,"guys maintaining and doing everything you're already doing, and I have you in on the 16th but I was going to see do you want to push that out, towards the end of the month. Since we met we push this one out."
6330.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Do you want to stick with the show one. might be nice to push it out okay. Maybe, rather than the 16th we go for the 29th. Okay, and is there a time that works best for you, would you rather earlier or later."
6330.0,Patient,"I like morning appointments to be honest. I don't know why get up I get up you. Know like things done, and over with swing nap in the afternoon."
462.0,Provider,"All right, let me see the earliest I can do on the 29th. The earliest I can do is one can you go for one."
6330.0,Patient,yeah that's perfect and i'll take my nap.
462.0,Provider,Perfect alright so we'll go for one on the 29th. And then we'll cancel next week to just kind of balance it out a little bit more. Alright hey Julie well i'm sorry that hacked but i'm glad you're figuring it all out sorting it all out.
6330.0,Patient,And yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Overall, you know it's just crazy you're maintaining and doing well, despite you know some of life's difficulties."
6330.0,Patient,Right right.
