107.0,Provider,Hello.
262.0,Patient,Hello.
107.0,Provider,how's it going.
262.0,Patient,"it's all right. stressed out trying to fit your lines, because things are going."
107.0,Provider,Okay. That does tend to be a.
262.0,Patient,"yeah I know so i'm trying to switch it up. yeah well I realized. When a dog doesn't want to be here, which is where you know. he's just kind of staring out the door and he just he wants to leave, and you know fluffy know extended brutal. And it's it's like a trial night. For thanksgiving thinking this is going to be the thanksgiving dog. So. it's right. and How are you. i'm good going."
107.0,Provider,he's going Thank you yeah.
262.0,Patient,"Last week last. Tuesday There was an attack a fight. With a dog and a Chihuahua. And that's always The worst thing that could happen. yeah besides the drowning person and. You know it all worked out. And it just it really took a toll on me for three days. After it's all said and done, you know we did that thing and. The offending dog's owner paid it just worked out is fine. But I. i'm just always this was really heavy and I think because. You know i'm doing the same time i'm i'm sort of wrapping up the taxes. Which is kind of stressing me out and realizing how much it is fucked up you know, and I realized my my filmmaking which was quite a bit and quite a bit more than. I thought for 2019 I made. 34,000."
107.0,Provider,wow good for you.
262.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and this year is. I mean, by the way, it's going it's got a much higher and I really do ya know exactly. I know 20 is going to be a little fun because uploaded and there's a lot of. Data in there that delivery. Service postmates. So. But then, with that comes all of the. You know the the whole insurance thing and. My son had a term. Over the weekend Bella him finding a new place to live in. With all the timing of winter blah blah blah, and all this and he said it was like threading a needle. And that that's kind of what this feels like like. You know, getting all these returns in order and then filing them and then switching insurances you know before. You know, medical looks no no before medical looks into whatever you know. That i'm just tired of worrying and. And so you know i'm really trying to take care of it, I didn't. hit me last night and I before those way in there, you know that'll that'll disappointment kind of coming in, about how you know I didn't write as much as I I wanted just to hold ship and. You know I just really look at it, realistically, it says, you know I look at the fucking day you know and and you know what realistically. Do I have time for so I don't lose my mind, you know because I think a lot of that that that bottoming out that I did was. You know just to. care is inevitable stress. You know about the lives of the dog and the and the wellness of the dogs and and that. You know that that is, that is my top priority. and So i'm doing okay with that and in the writing is. i'm just. It really like I sat down on Sunday last Sunday. and It says interesting how I can. I can. and other aspects of things like I can get it done, you know, and then, when it comes to writing it's like i'm going to give myself one week and i'm going to write a fucking supported will right i'm going to finish your story, you know and. yeah you know, and I came up with the idea for it and i'm going and. And I guess what it is, is i'm i'm really finding. And and fine tuning the voice and because what I want to do what happens at times. And what i'm longing for an imagined eventually will click in and happen, where I can just sit down and write. New stuff and just right without. Because what happens is. I wind up going back and going back and going back and starting over and tweaking and tweaking because I need. I need that flow to continue. And it just needs to be right, you know, and it is. You know Nestor says that it's it didn't used to be that way it was never linked us it was never."
107.0,Provider,"This sounds like you, when you were picking up materials and kind of creating different objects out of them, it sounds a little bit like it's that type of compulsive drive. Do you think this is some OCD type of stuff going on, like a. compulsive behavior to manage anxiety."
262.0,Patient,"Maybe I maybe I mean because it's like there's there's no denying like if I when I take records of it, you know, and I go back and I look it's fulfilling. Writing session that I ultimately have. But then the next day i'll go back and i'll see where it falls short and i'll start messing with it again."
107.0,Provider,idea.
262.0,Patient,What.
107.0,Provider,"And I read to you something and I want you to tell me if you feel like this rings true. Extreme perfectionism order neatness you'll need to sit. will also feel a severe need to impose their own standards on the outside environment. find it hard to express their feelings have difficulty forming and maintaining close relationships with other. hard working, but the obsessions with perfection can make it inefficient make them inefficient often feel righteous indignant and angry often face social isolation, they can experience anxiety that occurs with depression."
262.0,Patient,yeah I think there's a lot of that in me but but.
107.0,Provider,"I think a lot of when you see, I know."
262.0,Patient,"Right that's the thing it's like I feel like like with that I don't have that with the dog business or with my life in the House, you know."
107.0,Provider,yeah let me.
262.0,Patient,Just come down to now. With with my with the writing.
107.0,Provider,stiff formal Richard mannerisms that certainly was a time period for you being extremely frugal with money. it's overwhelming need to be punctual extreme attention to detail excessive devotion to work and it's expensive family or social relationships.
262.0,Patient,warning warning are useless items.
107.0,Provider,and ability to share or delegate work because of fear won't be ridden right fixation with lists rigid adherence to rules and regulations overwhelming need for order.
262.0,Patient,No.
107.0,Provider,sense of righteousness about the way things should be done rigid adherence to moral codes.
262.0,Patient,yeah okay.
107.0,Provider,So what I was reading is the obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
262.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Because, as a personality disorder, it would be a schema right, it would be kind of a way you operate so you could manage a. lot of. pieces of it, and it would still kind of resonate one or two areas of your life so it just started to think like. we've done a lot of work on this and yet you're finding that you're kind of still stuck in some places, are you kind of struggling with a schema that is going to rear its ugly head from time to time you're always going to need to manage it. Because I."
262.0,Patient,think that could just be a part of.
107.0,Provider,"Part of yeah yeah I mean, I think there have been you know i'm not anxious to necessarily diagnose you with something at the same time. there's something to be said for having a label that gives you a way to kind of manage what you're dealing with so that you have a structure and understanding, so that you can work through it. So I think there's definitely kind of enough there that you could then say okay well let's pretend that that's true, then, if that's true, then this is always going to be something that's going to be kind of a thing for me. And i'm going to shift my focus so sometimes it's going to be about. The dog business and then other times it's going to be about my writing and then other times it's going to be for a while there you were really frustrated with your folks. And kind of that whole dynamic so you're going to have something potentially that is always going to draw your attention and be like the thing for a while. I mean I don't think there's ever been a time period where you and I work together, where there hasn't been a thing. And so i'm not saying it's a bad thing i'm just saying that this is a way we we develop these schemas because this is how we kind of create the world and how we operate and how we function in the world. And it may be helpful for you to kind of look at it and learn about it, to give you a way to. manage your understanding of yourself a little differently, and if you find at the end of the day that doesn't make sense it doesn't work. We don't need to hold on to it, but it might be a way for you to develop some empathy and understanding for when you get kind of fixated on these spaces."
262.0,Patient,yeah so I mean So what is the point we bring those up. Something that.
107.0,Provider,"Are you trying to torture me because I. want you to develop understanding. so that you can roll with this a little bit more, because you come across and. Granted you're way better than you used to be. But you still come across as being frustrated with yourself or the world when you are not meeting a certain goal yeah or things aren't coming across the way you expect them to be, and I would like, for you to develop. Even more of an empathy slash understanding of the of your. Of who you are so that you can check those thoughts and feelings with. With knowledge as opposed to just to be nice to yourself, I think that. You know that's not going to roll with you. But if he can say, well, this is my OCD rearing its ugly head okay what am I gonna do about that. i'm not gonna i'm going to acknowledge it but i'm not going to dwell on it or i'm going to beat myself up, I have a tendency to go this way I have a tendency to be."
262.0,Patient,"yeah I will tell you, though, that that I do. I do let it go like that that's the way that I."
107.0,Provider,"know I think you've made a ton of progress with all of this, so at this point it's more just kind of. If it fits it's educational it gives you another little tool in your toolbox."
262.0,Patient,"yeah and I think. what's. Like I often think like kind of thing God that i'm not it's not an aside. You know, or I don't have a deadline for you know Jackie has been published, or something because. It would just seems impossible, you know and. So so that's what i'm just i'm just going under the understanding, I guess that it's just. Because you know and i've said this before it's like. Everything that I prayed on. manifests itself, you know it's like life is really a function on point and like lovely you know, and I tell you there's nothing that I physically tray on more. than the my craft and the writing, and so I guess the way it's going is the way it's supposed to go right."
107.0,Provider,"Yes. And that's the end. Earlier, no, I really do, but this is why I really think that you should spend some time. entertaining the idea learning more about OCD because the more i'm hearing you talk and i'm looking at this list, I feel like it really kind of resonates it's not this hardcore you know exact thing across all areas, but you have a very hard time accepting. it's an interesting dynamic because you're such a creative person, you have such talent for that, and yet and creative people tend to be very Lucy Lucy and very open and accepting and everything's it's cool man, and that is not you. know you are very. concerned and a bit rigid at. times and you get yourself pretty worked up about this stuff and if you created a deadline, if you create a deadline right you get fixated on needing to be punctual to that deadline."
262.0,Patient,"yeah. So I used to, and now with."
107.0,Provider,This much better.
262.0,Patient,I let it go.
107.0,Provider,"I agree. But at the same time it's still we're still talking about it right so. If you really let it go, we wouldn't even we've spent you know a good chunk of time on this, which is fine, I think that's great. But the whole point of this is that we're we're developing and different kind of understanding of the maybe the way you. The platform from which you operate that's kind of what schemas are you think about platforms, this is your canvas, this is the the the modality in which you kind of operate from So even if you have a lot of these behaviors and check they're still going to kind of. Be in they're still going to be in the background and they're still going to affect the way things roll out or the way things. process or the way the paint lands on the canvas. And that's just the part of your gig, and so the more you can appreciate and understand that the more I think you can take the edge off of the frustration when you have your frustration moments, you can kind of know it for what it is potentially."
262.0,Patient,"Right, so I mean is there, you know, in terms of learning more about this, what is."
107.0,Provider,"I think just you know for right now just don't spend a lot of time on it, but just kind of Google it or you know. Maybe do some basic research on it and just kind of develop some understandings and if it's something you really interested in, then I can look up some books and some different things, ultimately it's not about."
262.0,Patient,additional year so much as just understanding and developing of a platform of understanding it's not about changing anything.
107.0,Provider,it's more just appreciating and understanding that this is kind of your.
262.0,Patient,And now. hey hey hey hey. you're saying it's OSHA stop please stop.
107.0,Provider,"Obsessive compulsive personality disorder Okay, so the acronym is oC PD. If you end up not remembering any of this will review again next time it's not a big deal, this is not something we need to check off on a box anytime soon you will consider it a rule out. The dogs are definitely responding to something and getting all worked up about life."
262.0,Patient,"hey hey hey hey hey hey. park. park. Okay, so um okay now, then. So i've been noticing. That you know here, I am a major can of worms and I didn't even I didn't even think you know and. My sponsor is getting here. This is new, this is recent and my friend from the program is getting there could be as baby in a wedding. And weddings. And so i'm noticing now when this ship comes up. With Esther there's something there and it's like a heaviness and. A there's something there was something or resentment or something and. The first time i'm like Maybe it was I don't know I don't know what it was, it was obviously something about these guys getting married so last night jake was the dominant those is what gave me the Save the date. So I brought it home, and here it is again right here's this. obvious. displeasure right, and so I just I said all right one, what is going on, because there's something, and what is it, and so we we you know we it started as kind of a high pressure. thing. And she was going to the gym anyway so she she wound up going and coming back, and this was. Probably about 11 she got back and so she was I knew, she was thinking, while she was gone. And it's just never it's something we had not discussed. My thinking you know, and this is just the beginning of this that you and I are going to start discussing. But you know my ideas of marriage and, apparently, this is just the fucking relapse that just keeps getting. That from the last one, when I just said all this crazy shit that I have no recollection of like whatsoever legitimately and apparently I talked about it, I thought during then and. I said at that point that I wasn't interested, which is actually true and fluffy no. Please stop. And so it just you know it. Was he was gone, I was thinking it through and. And it's one of those you know and it's it's how it was my in my first marriage, you know we're both coming from a place of. You know and that's the thing it's so big where do I even start with this with you, you know and it's like you and. Just the with my first marriage. It turned into a huge fucking wait, because there was apparent apparent proposal. But she didn't. She said to me, what would you say you know what would you say if I asked you to marry me, and it was like we're just talking about. A number of different things, and so I said, well, I you know at this point in my life, I would say no, because we have this exact so but in her thinking that was her proposal and, and I said no to the proposal so. You know, from that point on, I knew that she was ready to get married, I was not, it was a matter of me catching up and that's how the whole marriage, but she always wanted something and I wasn't ready and I had to build like you know get ready and so. For me. I didn't I was having the feeling that that's what was happening again, was that. You know this was something that we had never discussed but Esther was waiting for you know she was unhappy because she was not getting married because I am you know, like what what's going on and. I guess there you know, there might have been some of that terrible I mean we really talked about. What what it is for us and. and Like honestly I just as I just I never really considered it, I never. thought about it much I just. My feeling was that we were in some fucked up marriages, can this is nice so cool you know and also. I know it's one of my institution things you know it's like I get going on, you know the institution of marriage and the assumptions and social thing of it that I just did to me is like. marriage is not the ultimate. You know my proposing to you is not my ultimate display of love and like you know it's. You know, by the end I you know I said I mean you know and from where i'm from you know and apparently and I guess, this is more of a woman thing like. Her mother asks are now and again, and people ask, and you know we I know she lost a friendship over it, because you know I already told you about this her friend was like really heavily Christian or whatever and. Esther was living in sin. The friendship deteriorated whenever. yeah so. You know that whole thing like when you're going to make an honest woman Oliver and all that shit and. You know, and in terms of that like social perception stuff is like I could give a shit you know not any of that and. And my feelings of marriage are not good, you know I my parents and and my marriage and her marriage and we watched her ex husband go through another fucking disaster of a marriage and. it's just like why fucking ruin the good thing you know everything is white label it why anything like that. But then I realized that that's a lot of old shit you know so then after she came back i'm like you know basically. You know this is something we're going to talk about it with Sean and you know just so we're on the same page, and we agreed, you know we don't want this to be a shitty topic bad topic to talk about and. And I voice, it was like I don't I don't really want to wait on me that I am, you know that we are waiting for you know we're waiting for me to propose it should be a mutual. thing if we if we're going to do this and you know for the for the right reasons, and you know, basically, I am in this relationship till till I die is how I honestly really feel I feel this is it and. You know, whatever we need to do so that we're both happy with that you know, is there gonna ask her is that is that, where you are as well and it's yes, I mean this is it. So. You know I mean it's. i'm i'm open to it i'm not. or i'm opening to where i'm trying not to be. You know that old stuff about it. But I. You know I don't have a necessarily find. feeling of marriage."
107.0,Provider,"let's take a breath. How about you find out from Esther what it is that she when she thinks about. Marriage get rid of the title. What is it that she would like to have happen. Does she want some sort of ceremony does she want something in writing does she want does she want to label. You know what is it just that she wants people stop asking. And maybe if she can figure out what she wants, then you guys can come up with something that makes sense for both of you and do that, so if it's about a ceremony, you could maybe do a native American ceremony or something I mean there's all kinds of traditions and things out there. That are have a very different feel to them that would maybe honor. Really, the bigger picture intention, which is that you to want to be connected for life, and that this is your final. relationship you're not interested in waiting for another thing or something like that so maybe there is, you know learning about different traditions different things, and then, when somebody says. Are you married, you will be able to answer that question with we are joined, we are. Whatever Union have to add to it right, you can just say yes, because they don't care. What What matters is, you know that it's something to. Ask and maybe that's a way to honor the connection. without it being a traditional thing, because I think there is a part of you that will continue to kind of rebel against that, and I also think that there's something to be said for. Acknowledging that both of you have had negative experiences and neither one of you want to kind of rinse and repeat and that if you find yourself doing the same thing it feels a little bit like a setup for failure in that, but if you do something different. Then you have a you get to have a different experience and you can take some time now to explore what that could look like without any kind of need for it to be a certain date, or whatever you can just start exploring how could we. honor this long term commitment and what would make sense for both of us that feels good to both of us, and then we could plan it and make that happen, and it could be any number of things. yeah. Especially if you're willing to look at all possible, traditions, you can really it would be very interesting potentially."
262.0,Patient,"Just even learn, you know my my first marriage was. You know my I was completely against tradition, you know we got to just the juice and I built the bad character, with the whole thing. Just before it even comes to that. You know, because then it's done it's really just planning for this thing and."
107.0,Provider,"I think believe you learn about wanting to do. Better, but I think it may be just allowing yourself to explore what it is that what it is that you're looking for what it is that she's looking for and and just learning so you can use different traditions, to help develop an understanding. Of what it is that you want, so you go to 12 step meetings, not because you're 12 step zealot but because you want the structure of understanding what recovery looks like for you. You, you have a sponsor and i'm because you're a sponsor junkie but because you want the structure to kind of create recovery and to keep you accountable so. You kind of bought into some traditions, if you will, to create something that makes much. it's a much different kind of dynamic that works for you, so I think you can learn all kinds of things about different cultural ways to represent longevity and a relationship to understand what it is that really resonates for you in that."
262.0,Patient,So it's not an assumption that you're planning that event so much it's just pre.
107.0,Provider,Pre creating the context to develop an understanding for what it is that you value in this relationship.
262.0,Patient,Yes.
107.0,Provider,"And I think exploring it together will take some of the pressure off of this or to feel like she's anxious about this because you're learning about this together. And and learning, not just about the cultural piece, but what resonates for each of you as individuals."
262.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. driving the way we left it was. was good, and I know that. Today, I had the natural. or unnatural the old. thing one day I just shelled up. I can feel it I didn't I tried not to. She was she was very extra affectionate and. I know that the conversation that we had these her for sure and. I spend the day sort of avoiding eye contact and. Not reciprocating that. And I and as it was happening I I knew it and I tried not to do it. Like it's that old feeling it's it's like I used to think it was like a tape of autism. When I when I I bristle at affection and displays a while and it just it doesn't make any sense and. You know now it's starting to happen so it's kind of. You know, was resisting doing that."
107.0,Provider,"kind of like, but I was saying earlier granted and struggles to be in Internet really."
262.0,Patient,yeah no me.
107.0,Provider,Either waxing and waning and kind of behavior right you. Know yeah.
262.0,Patient,So.
107.0,Provider,"But you experienced a. lot blow to your psyche. In something coming in with this unnerving conversation and so that's going to kick up your schema right. you're going to have a. Like Lou what is this and you're all those things are going to fire up. But now you have much better awareness about it, so you manage it, you settle down slow down, but that is just again understanding that this is kind of your. Potential you know this is your way of kind of reacting the life and the more you engage it, the more you're going to kind of go down a negative path versus the less you engage it manage it, the better it is for you."
262.0,Patient,"yeah. I would, I would say that. Now, both of those things are. The way that it's going with the writing and in a way that that. worked out is. I mean it, I would say that that pretty much. sums up like. You know how things are going, and just in terms of managing life. You know, in general, and."
107.0,Provider,"How are things going with your son, because you were a little bit frustrated with that situation last."
262.0,Patient,"yeah i'm good. we're. Getting together with our former boss, on Saturday astronauts former boss, where we met actually. and Barbara Barbara she hasn't seen him since he was three so It took some coordinating. Over we're meeting up in San Francisco on Saturday and I didn't think about that during that. I can see how it goes but see if I can get him alone, while we're walking or something and ask him for go to the family session with me. and November. So, to start with that so that's been set up, not a not a date or time or anything with Sean but the understanding that that cheese we're going to talk with her about it. i'm just gonna say you know there's you know there's things that. That you know we have a difficult time, you know talking about you know, without them, you know that other emotions mostly money related and you know let's go work it out. and You know, and every day I think about about what you know what how I would like to go and. You know what i'm cool with committing to and and all that but I, you know I mean I just think if I want, but you know I wanted to, and I think it will be good, I mean I know it'll work out work out good. So. yeah i'm just hoping that he's hoping open to it, and you know it doesn't turn into a tough thing and. So it's good you know, and I told him that from. When when he was planning on moving in you know and and there were anxieties about how you know we might deal with each other, mobile blah, and I said to him Danielle if there's issues we're just going to go to therapy. About at night send them back then so so this will be there, that makes sense it's."
107.0,Provider,not something I haven't. talked about yeah.
262.0,Patient,"And i've really worked go. You know, because the last time that we got together and had lunch he kind of voice tell you, he knows that he's behaving like a good I put it, but just that he no, no, no, he wanted more space and and all that. So where I used to text every night, you know good night I love you for years. I stopped i'll do it, maybe once or twice a week. And maybe you know once in a while in the morning, but I really like. and Then any called Sunday just to talk, which is nice very Monday, it was I thought he was coming back from work and maybe it was Friday. So that was nice, you know even so. it's just called just to kind of catch up and see how things are going and. You know, vice versa. he's doing well and. it's good I mean, I think I know everything will be."
107.0,Provider,Good.
262.0,Patient,So. Yes. yeah.
107.0,Provider,Well that's a lot.
262.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's all you know. dude dude dude was definitely a. A joy. And a. pleasure and satisfaction. In every day, now that is relatively. New I think there's a new level of acceptance. With myself. And really looking at my days and what i've accomplished and. Then, giving myself, you know more credit. So yeah. So now i'm gonna get my."
107.0,Provider,"calendar. No go ahead. No, I was just gonna check in. On the cigarette."
262.0,Patient,"yeah that's. True, I was you know, I was on it. mentally and it's it's religion being mentally. on it and it's got to start with me counting. And I was doing a prior to my mother's visit. And then, when she came I just abandon that. So I need to I need to get back on to that. Because I know what I need to do is count and come back. And i've done it with fucking everything else, and so now, I need to do that with cigarettes and i'm I want to start cutting back on the suboxone. You know I keep thinking that. You know I seriously I have fucking intentions of ending the month with an open the box. Because there's no fucking reason why I can't get by with to a day. And why is it that when it comes. anywhere for like. Three hours. I like it makes me uncomfortable the see that situation of movie because I am. These these things, and that bothers me a lot, you know, like I would never be able to pick up and go with just you know cause I. wouldn't be to. to live. pleasantly and comfortably with. And I just I don't want. So. know that word dissolves card. And that's why i'm. My comfort in knowing."
107.0,Provider,Okay. So when are we meeting again.
262.0,Patient,"Here, my calming separation anxiety music."
107.0,Provider,Nice.

107.0,Provider,"I don't know if any of that garbage good came through but basically he's struggling with his cigarette smoking and he wants to get off of the suboxone but he can't really get off of the suboxone until he builds with the cigarette smoking so. we're in a bit of a double bind in that situation, I guess we'll just continue to follow up. And so, our next individual session is on November 16 17th sorry 7pm and let's also please on the diagnosis add a rule out for.

Alright, thank you."
