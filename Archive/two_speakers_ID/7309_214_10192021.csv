And you never you never have to be worried about being transparent with me because you'll never see the reprimand come from me, I am very much of understanding, so when we do get this off a friend."
7309.0,Patient,"No um I got I had some foot up and I had somebody hold them for me and. I guess I should have just not. I didn't trust, I mean I thought I was stronger than when I was and I guess the person I trust in the whole them wouldn't a strong as day I thought either so that's why I said, this has been humbling for me to see i'm not as strong as I thought I was."
214.0,Provider,"Well, wait a minute let's let's review that I think you're as strong as you think you are we all are susceptible to some weakness cookies a movie spending money we don't have don't be so hard on yourself."

214.0,Provider,"Well, I don't want you to be because I am not seeing what you're feeling."
7309.0,Patient,On I was doing good.
214.0,Provider,"But you still doing good don't this one, this one trip that gave you a scraped knee doesn't define Jennifer read. This actually defines a new Jennifer Jennifer doesn't have to hide anymore doesn't have to come up with lies and doesn't have to be deceitful Jennifer can be honest that's a big big move Jennifer."
7309.0,Patient,I didn't see it like that. But I guess. I don't I just I don't know. I looked at it as real weakness but I didn't even think about what you just said.
214.0,Provider,"Your your let me actually just a serious question now so go back into your addiction, how much lion was there."
7309.0,Patient,Every day.

214.0,Provider,But not today.
7309.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to because I don't want to be like that."
214.0,Provider,"So here you go, this is the new Jennifer this is something to be proud of this is something to say you know what i'm going to stand up and be responsible and i'm going to be accounted for. And i'm not gonna have to hold back i'm not gonna have to hide this i'm just gonna have to work through the process of why and why was we came to all weakest moment until the person holding those pills. came to the weakest moment."
7309.0,Patient,"and When we felt bad for me. Through That was a weekend, so they were not as strong as I thought on not just on as I thought, so it was really humbling like I said I just. know."
214.0,Provider,How many milligrams did you take.
7309.0,Patient,I don't really I don't know I didn't think about it being on. Probably three pills all together.
214.0,Provider,Probably two milligrams each i'm assuming.
7309.0,Patient,No one yeah one milligram each okay.
214.0,Provider,So when's the last time that took place what day was that.
7309.0,Patient,The day ever surgery last Thursday. And the day after.
214.0,Provider,So the 14th. yeah would you take like two and one or three and three.
7309.0,Patient,"One at a time. And that's even different because I was nice to take them all at once. Myself manny and said well if I take them responsible, it will be different. Even though I took them differently it's still I didn't have to use during the situation and I did I thought I was stronger and I just wasn't."
214.0,Provider,"What could we do different if if another. we're faced with with turmoil what what is something we can do different in our relationship, your relationship with yourself."
7309.0,Patient,"To go see the pain. or type of chart, and so I need. Somebody yes, could I have called though just out of the blue, without us having an appointment screen thing."
214.0,Provider,"I am here for every. person I work with my job is to be a valuable to know when crisis is there and to be there for them that day, maybe not that moment, but I promise you, if you ever call. it's a guaranteed, as this is being recorded, I will see you that day, and we will work through it all you need to do is hold on to the time I tell you, we can meet and we're good."
7309.0,Patient,"Okay okay so yeah like later today at five just say, for example, I was really upset I can call the check in number and do that."
214.0,Provider,"So you call the virtual clinic this which this is how it would go you call the virtual clinic and you say I work with many i'm not i'm. i'm in crisis, not suicidal I need to talk to him, he told me to call, they will contact me immediately to an instant message I will see it come up. And I will tell them tell tell Jennifer at this time, I can see her today it won't be tomorrow it won't be two days from now it'll be that day."
7309.0,Patient,Okay that's that's good that is good. that's what I should have done.
214.0,Provider,"Well, we didn't talk about it, how about that john for so again, I know you're doing that beat yourself up thing I need you to stop. Take the gloves off have a cup of coffee look in the sky and say I am transparent today, where I was not before your new your new and improved I will keep pounding that in. Most people who would have done this word it just said, you know what what somebody knows doesn't hurt them, the problem is yeah it doesn't hurt me but it hurts you keeping the secret. You didn't keep a secret you came right out this is wonderful this isn't bad, this is an embracing moment."
7309.0,Patient,"It is it really is. I know i'd never even thought about it for a minute to wrap it up how I used to behave and I lied about it, I would have never would never said anything. I wouldn't tell. Everybody."
214.0,Provider,"There you see look at the new Jennifer come on now. Get get get give yourself a clap give yourself an accolade, this is not who you used to be, so we have a new Jennifer on top here. And it's not about taking the pills it's not about being weak it's about being human it's about putting his shoes on one foot, at a time put your pants on one leg, at a time. you're human you're not a robot you're not there's no dials I can change is no reset things will we can change is the truth, and this is what you did."
7309.0,Patient,"They change here Ryan, I like that."
214.0,Provider,"Listen, I know it's hard for people to believe that the truth will set you free but all that means is. When you take responsibility, others can be there to embrace you and hold you and say we understand now let's let's figure out what we're going to do, going forward and that is a remarkable feat so early in your recovery."
7309.0,Patient,yeah. yeah I guess so.
