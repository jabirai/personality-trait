214.0,Provider,morning morning how are you.
11376.0,Patient,"All right, little tired, but i'm all right."
214.0,Provider,how's it going.
11376.0,Patient,"pretty good i've been picking up some extra hours here and there, trying to keep myself a little busy."
214.0,Provider,Is it helping.
11376.0,Patient,yeah it's a nice little distraction it's not negative it's not positive I mean it helps with the bills and stuff so.
214.0,Provider,how's the medication working out.
11376.0,Patient,Good good no complaints honestly.
214.0,Provider,"awesome glad to hear that all right so let's just let's just do what we do um so I wanted to give you a view of your chart. Because I always think that's important instead of us talking about what's not happening, we can talk about exactly what we're doing so, if you can see all the green lights right. All these other things don't apply to you so everything is up to date, which is fantastic, thank you for that i'm. The last one shipment we're trying to figure out what's going on with yet so if I had an answer, give it to right now I think there's something that's not right in the system so i'm not going to utilize this at all, though it's reflective. mean Dr Malik know what you're doing and how you're doing it so we're fine with that okay so don't. worry. About that good."
11376.0,Patient,"i'm not i'm not pressed about it, I did talk to them yesterday, and they want me to go to a clinic lab. lab right and I went to work yesterday and my boyfriend texted me and said hey guess what showed up in the mail today and I was like oh surprise. I think I might have to change my mailing address and have that set somewhere else I don't know if my neighbors so tampering with my mail, so I don't know if my I don't know if it's the mail man, you know what I mean. Some things up, I don't know if they're touching it I don't know what to do at this point with that, I do have it, though, and when I checked in to to come see you, I told them that I did have it, so I will call in, and I will take care of that. immediately so yes or no, what happened, I don't know what's going on with that, like I said I may. i'm going to give it one more one more month and see. If it happens again i'll just change my shipping address to somewhere else."
214.0,Provider,"Fair no let's just leave it like that good so. The other thing they want us to address is what's like a treatment plan things that we're working on and stuff like that the reality is you know. You have been working on being transparent. Right. So there's nothing in this treatment plan. That really changed, I think the only thing that's employed and is to remember right that you're on the MIT program that's an important process of your treatment plan. They have to. Be cognizant of. Our mood swings whether their anger or depression by so nothing's really changed in here, everything is still the same, I think you stay away from people places and things."
11376.0,Patient,Based on.
214.0,Provider,"I get you because that's almost impossible to do, but I think other than that this treatment plan is fine, the only thing i'm going to add to the treatment plan is our this here, so I don't know why this has, are you going to group three times a week. I am going to change that right now to twice of once a week because that's what you've been doing religiously. Right. i'm going to change that and I don't need to add any additional stress by you, having to attend more."
11376.0,Patient,That was even three times a week.
214.0,Provider,"I know, and I just looked at it now so that's why we're going to correct it."
11376.0,Patient,"Okay, no."
214.0,Provider,monthly so now. So you can see it.
11376.0,Patient,that's crazy i'm still a suicide risk like there was when I first started talking to her yeah I was really depressed but i'm like i'm a coward all i'd never extended that far plus I know how it would affect my children like that's.
214.0,Provider,it's okay.
11376.0,Patient,I get blue but yeah i'm. i'm when I use for my you see you.
214.0,Provider,"And I respect you and I appreciate that you have a protective factor this here is something I wanted to talk to you about, but I don't want to jump around and. watching to see what we did so it's weekly twice a month with me weekly groups monthly charts right that's exactly what your frequency should be fine. Okay, so when we. We look at this this initially. was on your chart, and this is what I keep reporting and I think this will be the last time and i'll take you off of it. I just says you're at low risk. You know what's important to us, children and family easily able to control thoughts right, so I do want to take it off, but what I wanted to hear, though, is let's just look at that last submission of your pH Q nine right. Okay, so you're at six, which is mild and considering it's the holidays to children that there's a lot of things, this is manageable, I think this is a safe. reflection of your life I don't think it's dangerous if this was in the double digits I probably couldn't adjust that and your anxieties that one."
11376.0,Patient,"But I mean yeah I feel like i've really. yeah progressed quite a bit honestly from the first time that I came in and started talking to. The counselor here and then now they've switched to you like, I feel like i've actually come a long way honestly like even at work like at work. they've addressed a couple things with me that they wanted me to work on work and things that like because I talked to myself, like when I get upset like. All ramble to myself and if people around they hear me and I offended someone one day and they didn't realize it like I was literally just rambling to myself and it's in a and they brought it to my attention and i've worked on."
214.0,Provider,Like any.
11376.0,Patient,"criticism. Sorry, I. I take criticism well and if it's something that I need to address I address it and i'm like kind of proud of myself because, like i've been able to like do that and and not like lose my bearings of where i'm at in my recovery and everything."
214.0,Provider,"But that's, this is a good reflection point someone's address something to you. This is your self regulating skill someone's like hey this doesn't seem right to me. And you're cognizant of it, you don't need to be angry about it, other people just don't know what's going on, I think that that is okay, I think what's really Okay, is that you're able to talk about it right and that's what I always say about the transparency, how much do you love yourself. These are the things sometimes that we need to do because that's how we self regulate and without it, I don't know what we would do so it's not a bad tool so i'm glad to be able to work through that at least. listen to what people are saying, because sometimes we just don't know what our behaviors are and i'm not saying that's a bad behavior that may be an uncomfortable thing for someone else it impacts someone else you know i'm saying. So."
11376.0,Patient,"I made them uncomfortable I made them feel some type of way and it was because I was rambling I was upset at work. because somebody was supposed to there's three other people supposed to be helping me do the one job and I was the only one doing it. And I was upset about it, so I was just mumbling to myself about you know this is bullshit like. i'm not the only one, he should begin nice all night, this is the seventh time that i've had to film both ice chest like i'm tired of doing Obama and i'm just i'm just rambling to myself, because i'm upset. And someone overheard me and it turned into a big thing, and it was like, why is it even a big thing like I was. i'm upset because i'm doing it by myself that should be the big thing like you should be addressing the fact that there's three other people that should be helping me what I will work on not mumbling out loud to myself, I will work on keeping that dialogue inside."
214.0,Provider,"awesome Okay, and this is good, but I do want to show you when you say you think you've done so much better, so this is an October submission your depression was at 11. And now it's currently at six you've reduced that by 50% whatever was going on at that moment, or that two week period is no longer present, so when you're saying yourself. Am I doing better, the answer is yes, just by the survey numbers your anxieties and eat in October it's a one now in December. eight weeks later you've you've changed something in the optics or you're processing or at least you know just dealing with the truth so you've done extremely great job."
11376.0,Patient,"yeah well I just started the new job, too, and I was, I took on a lot that job was i'd never waitress before, and it was a lot when I first started, I was like holy crap the memories or menu and learn drinks for alcohol people and. Like I was just like holy shit and and all the other stuff that on the side that I have to do that, you know you don't even think about like people are bringing new drinks and food, but trust me there's 30 other things we're doing in the back for for different people. Plus all the work that we're here, we have to do all night long and I was just like holy shit so yeah no i'm really comfortable in the position now I got it under control so yeah yeah big change."
214.0,Provider,"So, and I think it's important and it's a general discussion, sometimes we don't know why we're doing things like these surveys I get what everybody. Is is thinking about why they don't need to do it, but the reality is, if we look at them, we can actually trend. and see how we're making much better improvements, so I like doing this because I, you know I can talk all day long until you doing a great job, but if I show you something. it's really reflective of like yeah I understand that it started this job i'm here now so you're really doing a great job you really are i'm very happy to work with you, I think. you're a positive influence for the group, and I think I know the mere fact that you can be transparent about your life is very reflective on how others. are trying to be like well of katherine's dawn or Catherine saying the job or you know I hear what you're saying it's just a very motivating thing in group for someone to take a leap like that, so I appreciate that do that you know. So let's just take a look at the meditations real quick we're still on the beauty and the procession. No cravings know urges."
11376.0,Patient,"No, I don't have any complaints right now I feel very. I know that, as I get closer to Christmas i'm going to fluctuate a little bit i'm already like mentally kind of preparing myself for that, because I know it's not going to be easy, especially like the day before Christmas, the day of Christmas and. Like that whole week that whole stretch into new years and stuff like that that I know I know at some point i'm going to have a breakdown so i'm like already kind of just mentally like. reminding myself is going to be okay like I know i'm going to have a breakdown, I know i'm going to her, I know it's not going to be easy, however, the sun's still going to come up the sun's. don't want to go down the goal is still going to be okay nobody's gonna. Hopefully die hopefully nobody's gonna buy like it'll be okay like it's just going to be emotionally tolling and mentally tolling like it's going to be OK, though, so like i'm trying to. just keep myself aware of that, like it's okay i'm allowed to feel those feelings it's okay i'm allowed to be upset i'm allowed to be depressed i'm allowed to be sad that i'm not with my kids it's okay. So just keep reminding myself that because sometimes I. You know, get hard on myself and i'm like oh you can't you know you shouldn't be crying or you shouldn't act like that, or you shouldn't be feeling this so like i'm trying to remind myself like it's Okay, though, like go ahead cry like you need to be okay."
214.0,Provider,"Absolutely, so how Fridays Fridays work for you."
11376.0,Patient,"um Fries i've typically been going into work at 11 in the morning, so I mean they work, but like if we were to be talking right now i'd be like getting ready for work and stuff."
214.0,Provider,"Fair enough house, so what what other days work at this time."
11376.0,Patient,So i'm in session typically giving me Tuesdays and Wednesdays off today i'm off tomorrow I picked a shift up so like typically Tuesday is like the day that they've been giving me off.
214.0,Provider,So then.
11376.0,Patient,I don't know how they do their holidays they're like I don't know how they do their days off and stuff so I don't i'm not sure what's going to happen in the next week or so.
214.0,Provider,"So kind of lead, can we meet on 1228 at the same time. yep it's a Tuesday."
11376.0,Patient,"Anything changes I will call in and let you know, but when o'clock on the 20th. Okay."
214.0,Provider,"I think this listen, I think you know. it's you need to know it's okay that it's going to fluctuate. You need to know the sun will come up to some level down like I think it's a very good thing, because when we start to. Be delusional about things like this is always going to be the same, that is really changing the reality is, you have to change so much from the first time I met you till now it's reflective right, so you know embrace that embrace those moments that you're doing a great job."
11376.0,Patient,"I like that you show the surveys and stuff and you go to the church she didn't do that with me and i'm not saying she's not a good counselor because she was. But like I like the fact that some people are visual people and i'm a visual person and seeing the visual seeing like look, this is October, and this is no. Like because i'm a visual person like at work when people want their steak cooked a certain way, I have a card and I show them because i'm like hey. i'm a visual person, maybe this will help you decide what level you want your steak cooked."
214.0,Provider,"And that's a. Good point. And I also think, I think, as we work as a team in a partnership, you know it's great to someone can say hey you're not making you're not doing your urine you're not doing this you're not doing that. You know you're telling me stuff like you're talking at me, can you show me something, because when I do this, all the time, people like. Oh yeah I didn't do my service okay so let's work on that or I have this issue with the john screen it's a communication, because this way it allows me and Dr Malik to make certain notes so nothing becomes punitive. So I like doing this and I also think it's important. This is part of what you're doing why shouldn't we show you what you're doing."
11376.0,Patient,Right right. I agree.
214.0,Provider,I tell I have you for the 28th at 10 o'clock.
11376.0,Patient,"Alright, that works."
214.0,Provider,Keep up the great work.
11376.0,Patient,"Thank you i'll see you Monday. Yes, alright."
214.0,Provider,Have a good weekend you too bye.
