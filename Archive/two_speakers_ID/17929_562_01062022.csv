562.0,Provider,"yeah that's hard to. Well, at this through this like online program we have group counseling once a week, but we also do individual counseling and I think individual counseling is going to be really crucial to helping you work through. Some of these illnesses and deaths in your family. I recommend that you know I used to be a primary care doctor and anytime someone lost a parent or lost someone very close to them, I always recommend it something called bereavement counseling have you heard of that. No bereavements just a fancy way of saying death know why we come up with new words in the medical. Because we need to sound important, I guess, but. it's just a fancy word of saying that so you know if you lose a parent or something I do think it's really important to process those feelings, so you can. find a way to exist with them, you know I won't say get over them because some people don't but. it's like this without crying all the time, you know."
17929.0,Patient,"It is it is it sucks I don't like bugs my kids every day when they see me do it, and like I said every morning every night. I said but it's true."

17929.0,Patient,"i've had one time, but it was it like I said it takes a lot of it just a lot of it stems from all the stress and launch right now, I think."
562.0,Provider,"that's really amazing you must be a really strong person, though, to."
17929.0,Patient,"My boss, is a daily to me my boss does i've been through life."
562.0,Provider,Such a great boss. He really understands.
17929.0,Patient,"he's a wonderful man, he is he's awesome he knows what i'm going through and he has for my family works with me here. Is he wants me to write a book matter of fact, about my life. i'm thinking about it really. um."
562.0,Provider,"How about we try I couldn't it sounds like it sounds like you, maybe you just need a little bit of a bump and i'm worried I don't want to give you too much either let's try two and a half, film, so you can take an extra half sometime in the middle of the day. there's not enough next time next week i'll give you three okay nice people can get to sedated. And that's also can be a problem to. Not off a little you know so. you're and you're driving as I can see, so I don't want."

562.0,Provider,"So maybe you can decide when you want to take the second the last half, you can take it later in the evening or the middle."
17929.0,Patient,right before the dinner.
562.0,Provider,"You know, sometimes when people take it too late in the day, it can it can cause them to kind of feel awake and then they have even more trouble sleeping.
