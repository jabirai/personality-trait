497.0,Provider,Why did you decide.
12499.0,Patient,"Well, I knew that when I got on it like I was asking a lot of questions about it, and I did a lot of my own research and I just knew I didn't want to be on it long term, and I know all the research behind like. there's this high percentage of people who stop using it relapse and I understand all that, but I just knew for personal reasons, and my own beliefs, that I didn't want to be on this long term. And i'm feeling really secure in my sobriety and my support system, and I just. yeah, I just wanted to start getting off of it often."

12499.0,Patient,yeah and if i'm honest with you there's like some nights that I forget to take it or I just I don't take it and i'm pretty inconsistent and so i'm already I feel like taking less.
497.0,Provider,"Do you think about on a regular basis, are you how many days a week, are you taking just a rough estimate."
12499.0,Patient,"Like four days a week. yeah i'm taking I taking I recently my dosage recently increased to 24 but I more so, been taking like 16 every day consistently, but sometimes I do take 24 or 20 or 20."
497.0,Provider,"Oh cuz if you were taking three I was gonna suggest you go down to two and a half, if you really think you're taking to do you want to go down to."
12499.0,Patient,"Answer no yeah um. Let me see yeah I mean let's try with one and a half, I think that would work and. If I am experiencing weird systems and symptoms and maybe I can go back to two. Or, and then and then start decreasing I guess what do you."
497.0,Provider,Have you ever heard of the quantity patch.
12499.0,Patient,"know, I have the pills, though. yeah."
497.0,Provider,"Your body and like whenever you take a pill obviously goes in your mouth your stomach it. peaks within a you know half an hour to an hour, depending on what the medication is and then it drops and climate, the drop precipitously. can get dizzy and stuff like that what's neat about the climate in patches you put it on the map for seven days and you get a constant source of the climate in which."
12499.0,Patient,I like to use that when people are winning or even when they're in the 90 taxing them at the place that I work at so um I would you.
497.0,Provider,"And I see you have Blue Shield insurance, I may have to fill out a form or something you know jump through hoops or whatever, but I would like you to do that."
12499.0,Patient,The side effects.
497.0,Provider,"um well, like, I said that the one for. for taking a pill is more so than there's a minimal side effects that I have seen because it's a low dose being given at constant right that's the neat thing about transdermal patches."
12499.0,Patient,Farmers they're giving you this pre sent dose. Okay.
497.0,Provider,put it on haven't said anything about you know yeah i'm sure it can do the same things about dizziness and all that other stuff but it's going to be a fraction of what you know when you have problems when you.
12499.0,Patient,"um no I didn't ever take it consistently I I haven't even opened this prescription, but I took a little while, though, for a different reason it made me pretty tired. yeah that's all I remember taking it and you got tired retaking it several times a day yeah. Okay, and do you happen to remember it was point long or Point two milligrams it was point one okay."
497.0,Provider,"So this is um like I said it's, even though it is about the point one it's not coming out it's not coming into your body, the same way. Okay, and here's The other thing let's say you put it on and let's say within eight hours, or whatever you said no, I don't like how I feel like take it off. and be done with it to keep it for seven days."
