Everything ago everything was so fresh you know, while I was talking to you, everything was just happening. So I feel like for me. take a step back resonate with my feelings and see how I feel about it, I don't think I still feel too crazy about it but. I think about it. yeah yeah. My um my son he had to go see miners Council. And he just wants to talk to her about stuff. But when I talked to my son, because he was asking me like oh what am I gonna see her what am I see her, and I was like I don't know like we got set it up so Finally, he goes to her. And I was like oh like How was it, she was like. Good I told her we were all fine and I was like well you didn't tell her what you wanted to tell her, she was like no and then I was like why didn't you tell her, and he was like well because I didn't want you are my Daddy get in trouble, I was like oh okay. So obviously he's not comfortable with her to talk to you about it, you know to her. yeah so. Just let it let it be you know."

You and it's never not I mean yeah he's not seen his dad his dad choice to you know. be gone. And that, for me, like it just all right well you got to give them up so it's like okay I can't see you anymore, or whatever. So for him he's already been through that with me enough times and it's not the first time he's been through that with me, you know. yeah that was me a few times, so I could see why. He would be afraid."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
10254.0,Patient,"And he's only getting older and I was young, in that timeframe you end up hating the people that are there to help you because you don't feel like they're helping you. I get it, I guess you know here's the thing."
726.0,Provider,"Well, I mean at least he feels comfortable telling you that information, you know and to be able to it's not like he misses you like you don't want to spend time with you."
10254.0,Patient,"Know yeah he does, of course, he tells me all the time, like Oh, I only get this long with you and it's so sad because it affects us so much to where like. My oldest son has like a deep connection with me like like when I tell you is me and my son like from the time she was like four years old, like the dad he was a dad but. Not in a mean way like your normal dad go to work he's tired take care of the kid you feed him, you know your home like your job, you know type of thing. So me and my son always had that bond I gotta go to the store where you take the kid you know, like, why are you gonna leave them with me. yeah bond with him always so for him now he's always just like well why can't I see you anymore, even if I go to the store it's like well we're all leave to go to the store to go get something he's faced timing me right away where'd you go like Where are you are you coming back. Like how i'm going to be gone for i'm like i'll be gone i'll be five minutes he's like okay five minutes long term put five minutes on my phone you know."
726.0,Provider,Like that's how like.
10254.0,Patient,yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's almost created I wouldn't say an issue but it's almost created.
726.0,Provider,Like.
10254.0,Patient,"An insecurity with him so for him to develop when he gets older with whoever he's talking to her he's with. Where are you like we're going like. You know. it's not into that you know if you can do with me his mom who's to say he's not going to do it with somebody else, or whatever you know. And it feels that like that way, so I don't know, I think that really does bugged me but that happen and I found out why he did that, like Friday, so I was like okay I can't really keep pushing the issue you know. So you got that thought and then God. is asking me to like refund him money because he paid for his glasses my son had gotten glasses and I told him like okay like bring me your receipt I told him bringing me the receipt and. He didn't bring me the receipt but he keeps asking me like are you gonna pay me are going to pay me, so I like I like kept like ignoring his question. And just aren't told you, bringing you the receipt you already said you bring it to me. not going to pay you without you giving it to me. And even now it's not first thing on my line because that's the case i'd rather go back to court because i'm so tired of dealing with you so take me to more because I don't care, you know I want to go anyways. I have the time or energy to sit there and keep doing that and I read this post Actually, I think it was the last time I talked to you, I read this post. Where it's at in a completely made sense, it was like a Co parenting thing it said don't ruin your mental health over someone committed to ruining your mental health. And that made. Such total sense to me. Considering that this person literally tries to talk to me in a degrading manner constantly. And it like. makes me feel like I told you, makes me feel like i'm going crazy like, why are you talking to me like this, where I feel like I have to like defend myself. And it's just come to a point i'm sorry it's just gotten to a point where i'm just like you're literally yeah you're you're literally trying to make me lash out try to make me angry try to make me upset try to make me, you know. All these types of negative emotions feelings thoughts because of you. And I think I just i'm trying to keep taking taking a step back, like he keeps messaging me through the APP kind of like in a mean way like oh i'm asking about the kids classes i'm asking about this. Well, at some point i'm going to stop writing you back I said, bring me the receipt you don't bring it to me how am I supposed to look to what I need to pay. your word for it and if that's the case if you need it so bad with you go back to court, like i'm just tired of keep messaging you, and not only that you want to keep messaging me saying Oh, I need money, I need money and I don't care at this point I want my stuff back I don't have certain. have certain clothes. I don't have a frickin dresser that I could even put in my mom's garage with all my clothes, because he has my dressers. My both of my sons are like we're saving your stuff for you mom we have your stuff you could come pick it up my dad says just come get it come get it. And yet I asked his dad and we have something completely set and I can't go at it and he's sitting there telling my son's oh yeah your mom could come get her stuff Whenever she wants and my son's you like mom go get it go get it and it's like boys If only you knew. it's not that easy. You know and it's kind of like it makes me even more sick being that you would even do that, like the fact that my own kids know like oh yeah your stuffs in my dad's closet. And you're sitting there, telling them like she could come get it like. yeah they taste like. you're just so like as a as a person i'm just. I don't like to deal with it anymore."
726.0,Provider,"I don't blame you that's really, really hard to deal with, especially when you want your stuff back, and you can even get your stuff back like."
10254.0,Patient,"And he wants to sit there and say Oh, I need money and that's why i'm like if that's the case you could ask me a million more times. go to court if that's the case if you need $75 that bad. Because you know what yeah I may still have to give you that $175 and I know I probably do, but the end the day you make everything so damn hard on me Fuck you know excuse my language, but like."
726.0,Provider,that's fine.
10254.0,Patient,"it's co parenting it's co parenting guess what at the end, the day, no one except the judge can make me do anything and same thing to you. So if that's the case you want your money so bad, the judge could tell me, you have he's asking you enough times well i've also asked you to give me the receipt. So."
726.0,Provider,"Maybe he doesn't even have a receipt maybe he's lying you know you know, like it, that he doesn't sound trustworthy and also if he were to just ask you for money and just like not even show you the received on that sketchy."
10254.0,Patient,"And only that when I had asked, remember, I told you like what what's up with his glasses like, why does he need glasses like what happened, like. It he didn't even tell me Oh, he needs it for close up you know needs it for something far like he didn't tell me shit jack shit, the only thing he said, is he got two glasses, one for school one for home. And they're both like $180 so you have to pay for half that's all he told me, and I was like whoa what other information he was like that's all the information you need."
726.0,Provider,Oh. that's weird why why one for school and one for home like why can't. I can't one for both.
10254.0,Patient,"I think she got I don't I don't know I don't I didn't talk to him about it and that's another thing is he doesn't communicate with me so you're saying what if we can't afford to Paris, right now, what if we could literally only afford one. And we'll get one another one, and another month. But he thinks, I made a fucking money and I got $700 to give him this month, plus an extra hundred dollars, plus for me to live. I can't stand him. Like yeah."
726.0,Provider,man.
10254.0,Patient,"And he wrote me to messages I haven't read them yet, because the last two messages I ignored him. Because he kept asking about like the kids well because my son he needed to go to the dentist because one of his faces fell out. So I told him on Monday I was like hey he needs to go to get check. One of them fell out and my son told me another one fell out on the other side with you, so he probably should get checked up soon, and he was like Oh, they both already have their dentist appointment. He was like, speaking of that's going to cost money to are you going to pay for that, but when I took my son my youngest son to the dentist because I had. A day off to take my son to the dentist. I never paid anything so I told them. weird I didn't pay anything when I took molokai to the dentist when NICO got stuff pulled out varnished yes you're getting work done, but to go for your annual checkup cleaning to see hey what do we got to do. We have medical you don't pay for shit so you're still harping on me about money, just to once again you're committed to running someone's house or someone's committed to running your mental health, you know. kind of like i'm just so over it, and the lady Whenever she seen my son she didn't write anything she didn't say hey NICO said everything was fine I don't need to check in any further. or she didn't say hey, this is what happened hey NICO didn't want to talk she didn't pay, I met with NICO it was great nothing I don't even know that she met with my son. And i'm just i'm just so sick of it all like you guys do what you do, because what I do means fucking nothing literally, and I even read more it's crazy because we live in a day and age, where it's the Internet right. We don't live in the 90s, or the 2000s anymore oh. yeah number one you can listen to a lot more of fake stuff and you can also listen to a lot of more people like me or people like you or say I went online and i'm talking about my experience, you know. yeah realize. The system is not as fucked up as you think it is it's probably more fucked up anything, it is there's more people who go through situations where like dang I had this happen to me and. Just like the government you got Republicans democrats who are all in favor and all colleagues, and they want to make the other side hurt a little bit. This whole system is no different. You got one side. You got the other side you guys are all colleagues and you work in a building with each other, you owe favors to them, your favorites to them it's no different than even my work field even your work field."
726.0,Provider,yeah I used to work at T mobile hey I got a phone.
10254.0,Patient,This person needs it i'm going to add a line great I need you to tablet transfer them over. yeah work together. yeah everybody does that it's stupid for you to say that that doesn't happen.
726.0,Provider,yeah for me to think.
10254.0,Patient,That this whole thing has been orchestrated to Fuck me over i'm sorry i'm not i'm not your puppet.
726.0,Provider,I don't want.
10254.0,Patient,"All rather be the black sheep in the family or in the group to say that that's wrong and you get in trouble for it, then let it happen to me that's just me."
726.0,Provider,"wonder if they could bring a third party in that doesn't know either of you to just look like or review the work that this other person's doing, because it seems like there's a favoritism happening like it's not. It doesn't and I know it, I am consciously aware that I only talk to you, so I don't know what's going on the other side but It just seems like not balanced out It just seems it's like one one side than the other."
10254.0,Patient,"Well it's never been balanced though it's I mean you have to be mindful this isn't the first time that my son has had to talk to this lady because of accusations of. My son's already said that he pulls that the data will gain his hair and hit him. yeah Weiss. And it's already been stated that there's not supposed to be any corporal punishment to these kids twice my son had to have had say this once, like last year, and maybe August September."
726.0,Provider,October yeah.
10254.0,Patient,"And then again when we went back around like December January, maybe, and we have the emergency screening. yeah and that's when they found out, but a dui that's when my son said yeah he pulls my hair he hits me. And that's wrong. that's what they said okay you got to go to therapy dad has to go to like parenting classes and. Even still to this day, when I told you what two months ago, when my son said Oh, he pushed me or how he pulled his son my son's here, because the baby out of trouble and the baby cognitive something so my son got his hair pulled so obviously it's still happening. But it's not something that they could pinpoint or they could change because of what my son's already been through my son's only my son six years old and he's already he's already traumatized by what that ladies done between our family dynamic."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
10254.0,Patient,"And that's really what it is you want to sit here and say nothing, how is my son gonna sit here and tell me he's afraid to tell you something why. he's not afraid of. Anything and I yeah and oh yeah i'll get him in trouble because he's my son and he's not afraid to tell me something. But here, he doesn't even know who you are, and he doesn't even feel comfortable enough with you in that sense, because he feels like something happens and I learned this in my parents in class kids do develop this because they're afraid something's going to happen to my mom and dad. Because they've seen it."
726.0,Provider,Before.
10254.0,Patient,"yeah i've seen something happened. Where like okay it's affected me with my parent before and I don't want that to happen. So it's not really and you know even even some of my friends will tell me like that sad that you know he can't even feel comfortable enough to speak about this stuff because. You know something's going to happen, but yet he knows, or like everyone knows that that's not Okay, you know for him to be in that situation or whatever isn't okay. I just want him to develop a little bit better for me honestly I think that's the biggest thing that I heard from this, because even my baby. My baby he's three years old and he's he gets very angry very angry he'll sit there and say like no like I didn't want this, I said no, or something and he's three years old and like run a store and she'll like oh do that."
726.0,Provider,"You know, probably misses you too, though. Because you like a car so limited."
10254.0,Patient,"They know they say all the time or or mom like what you go what like, then, you know it sucks because there's even a time where the dad said, like. Oh, the dad even made a comment like you take them on your time like take them to to go see Chelsea and it's like I only have two days, out of a weekend four days, out of a month with my kids and you literally still feel comfortable enough to say you take them we do it. Like you are basically a full time parent and you can't take a day off of work, you know, to take. or even to the dentist or the doctor is it's always like you take them you take them. I work and still have to take time off and pay you still. And you literally make it a point to almost be little my parenting or me being a mother and saying you take time off you take them you do it, you do it and i'll do it. Because my boss, I mean i'm working from home today because my boss is very accommodating i've told you this, I love my boss. yeah even my classes. I had to take my classmate my group session yesterday and he's like yeah go ahead and do it, I worked like seven o'clock yesterday. But I stayed later to do my my session with my group and he's like yeah that's super important like go ahead and do it. So it's like I have a job and not saying he probably doesn't have a job that would accommodate him. But why do you always have to harp on me or make it seem like I have to you're right I can't do it because my job allows me to. I don't have to, but I do it because it needs to get done and i'm willing to take that pay cut to make sure it gets done, what are you willing to do, and you still get money from me and you can't take a day off of work. it's just you just priorities are so fucked up and not only that like with just circles back to someone is committed to running your mental health. and get it done and be the person to do it, and I still get no recognition from it, because, like lady says, what do you want to do a fucking pat on the back for being co parent no I don't I just want fucking time with my kids that's reasonable and that's accommodating. And that should be fair, because this right now is unfair."
726.0,Provider,You know.
10254.0,Patient,So I just suck it up still but I haven't talked to her so so like there's anything going on.
726.0,Provider,"Well, you never know, maybe he'll be motivated to take you to court and she wants money."
10254.0,Patient,yeah I guess.
726.0,Provider,Oh. sounds like it is not helping.
10254.0,Patient,yeah it doesn't that's why like I said I just kind of leave it to what it is.
726.0,Provider,"Although. Even though, even though yeah like don't like something about patting yourself on the back or something but. At the end of the day when those kids are older they're going to remember that you're the one that took them to the appointments like if if he is actually not followings grow with his part as a parent. or he he doesn't it and not really wanting to then they're going to remember the fact that you were the one that would do that with them no problem, you know what I mean like it sounds like if there's a chip on his shoulder he feels like it's a burden to him they're gonna feel that."
10254.0,Patient,"yeah he says and that's funny because he says it all the time, and I find it weird and this is where I know he's very emotional and this is where I know like dude you're in your feelings he tells me all the time, like you know. Women could go off and be a start a whole new family, you know she was like what you're going to just leave me, and I think that worries him away. cuz he's always like I think he. He may think he's conscious about not having more kids. Were but he's still guy no i'm sorry you're still a guy you can still have more kids and yeah. I still have more kids but he may he has made comments in the past, were like oh you're really just going to go off and start a new family and forget about them or. have more kids and start all over."
726.0,Provider,"And then I take it as a kid. There you go so. There you go, so he is speaking from his own experience as a kid."
10254.0,Patient,"And he has he has a half brother and he loves his brother, but he's always felt like his step dad treating him different he still calls to step that dad because he did take on a role that his dad never even took on. Like his dad was never ever there like still isn't there. and his step dad stepped in but always treated him like a stepchild. And for him, he always hated that he always said, and you always even say like nobody's gonna love my kids like mine nobody's gonna love the kids you know, like their own. So I like he speaks from that. But he has to let that go."
726.0,Provider,"I mean, he. Yes, and also, if he doesn't want to work on that, or he doesn't think it's a problem he's not going to work on it, most people, to be honest. Most people don't want to work on themselves, like like people want to be different live different, but then they don't take the. They don't always want to take those steps to make that happen because it's painful and it's work it's not easy work to be like oh God my scarred childhood, you know. yeah you know you have to really wanna. You want to feel different than you do like. If you're not happy now it's like. What do I thought What steps do I have to do to get to the other side, and like I said, most people are not willing to do that. And they don't think that their mental health is an issue because they live fine and there's no issues but. You know I I don't know anybody that doesn't have issues like even the most well adjusted adults have issues everybody has them it's just not everyone's willing to like really work on them or make it a focus. So. But that's his journey, you know that. would be his choice to do that."
10254.0,Patient,"It is, and I think that's why that's also why I took my step back because. There is nothing changed about him. Like you said you could want you could talk about it all you want, but then again me. i'm I wouldn't say force but yeah anyway i'm forced to take these classes i'm forced to take these extra steps you know."
726.0,Provider,And this person.
10254.0,Patient,"isn't force and all they have to do is say yeah I have my kids i'm taking them here, I did my one little class and that's it, but I have to take. therapies counseling psych I, like you know not to take anything it's like i'm sitting here, trying to progress with someone who's sitting here still treating me like I was in a relationship with them."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you know, and I have to try and co parent with this person."
10254.0,Patient,"And i'm, not even in relationship with them anymore."
726.0,Provider,Like the other day he literally.
10254.0,Patient,"Had like had called me at least 20 times. Because I have kids and I had the kids an extra weekend I had them an extra weekend because I took him to the party so she dropped them off in my auntie's I told him I wasn't going to be available, I think I told you about this right."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, and something about driving or. yeah he was he was calling me yeah well because my my aunt lived in San Jose the party was in San Jose but my aunt and less live in the valley so."
10254.0,Patient,"She had to drive like an hour and a half, and he dropped her off in my aunt's house. And he was like well where the kids are supposed to be with you and I was like hold on I told you, I wasn't available Friday I said drop him off of my aunts Friday, you said okay. So you did that there with my auntie on Friday so he's like oh you're out you're you're doing you're out you're out. No i'm not out like i'm doing something I have something to do i'm making money like I don't have to tell you this, I don't have to tell him that and he's like well Where are you are you sleeping over there tonight Where are you sleeping tonight and i'm like."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, a lot of questions yeah."
10254.0,Patient,"And I get like to me, I was like you said you are going to allow them to come, I said drop them off and my auntie's that's exactly what happened. At that point, I don't need to keep talking to you and even at that my son has his phone So if you want to call him or, if you want to comment nc don't call my phone, obviously I haven't answered in the last two hours, why are you still blowing me up."
726.0,Provider,here.
10254.0,Patient,"Well nobody's answering i'm like okay well you just drop them off you knew we were going to a party tomorrow what the Fuck is a big deal because I have to be next to them. they're my family, you said I could have I don't need, and I think this is another she thinks I need to be with them every waking breath that I have them, yes, I definitely need to make it a point if they're on my time or share with me, I need to make it a point. But if I have something I have to do for an hour to on a Sunday or Saturday or Friday i'll be back or if pay, I have, and not in a mean way, but I bought these tickets, how long ago I couldn't go or whatever. i'm here to go. My kids are my kids are still my kids that doesn't make them not my kids."
726.0,Provider,yeah i'll be there and i'm going to take care of them.
10254.0,Patient,"And, especially if I know I have to do something on a Friday or Saturday or Sunday that I do have them and I do need to be away for them for a few hours. I always make it up to them hey boys, I have to go take care of this let's go do something, or when I come back we'll go do something, because I have to go, you know do. A parent you just always do that you make it up to them. You know it's just something you do so. For him talking to me like that it's just kind of like. I feel like i've taken my step back from the situation but have you. know just it just it's always going to make it hard."
726.0,Provider,"Hopefully, within a couple months or even a year from now you'll be in a very different situation in terms of this. relation with the cans and him."
10254.0,Patient,"yeah awfully. But i've already been dealing with this for like least two years now, so."
726.0,Provider,Well galena did you can we schedule for next appointment.
10254.0,Patient,"yeah um I was also going to ask you, I know I did my group therapy yesterday. But I thought I was in a mental health group therapy class and I felt like I was an addiction one."
726.0,Provider,"I don't know, let me. Oh substance use disorder. I don't know why you were put in that group. You were in some cities. But I don't know why they put you in."
10254.0,Patient,"Another lady had asked me like what do you want to go into substances group or mental health class one of them, asked me that someone did. And I told him a mental health class. And she was like okay well that classes in the fall yet so we'll have to wait so I was like. Okay, and then I had waited and then they're like hey you're supposed to be in a group session you haven't been going, and I was like well i've been waiting for them to tell me when the group is going to open because there wasn't enough people, she was like. Okay, well, there is now so it's on Wednesdays at six. I was like okay so. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"What I would do um, let me just look a good hold on. What I would do is when you're done like we're done today."
10254.0,Patient,call back.
726.0,Provider,"I would call that because. You have they you have three surveys that they have to you have to complete their their overdue. So I would do those and I would ask them why they put you in the substitutes disorder group. Because I don't even know why they put you in that group I don't have control over what groups, they put us, but I would clarify with them that you want them to have."
10254.0,Patient,"Well, because I know I know Chelsea wanted me to work on smoking lead so that's why."
726.0,Provider,"Maybe that's why, when I know."
