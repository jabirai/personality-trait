226.0,Provider,what's been going on.
11871.0,Patient,Generally school i'm in the training program for work.
226.0,Provider,"Oh wait, you know your cameras sideways can you."
11871.0,Patient,Oh sorry.
226.0,Provider,Okay.
11871.0,Patient,"Good because i'm using our laptop to support. yeah I know weird for some like when the speakers on top of it i've been told, when I based on people, it sounds weird so if. it's bad just let me know."
226.0,Provider,Okay you're okay right now.
11871.0,Patient,"Okay, oh. yeah yeah. Nothing really to be honest."
226.0,Provider,yeah what's going on.
11871.0,Patient,"I don't like while i'm still in training for my job, but like. Right now, like, I feel I feel like all of this, I just finished one right now, and I feel like it's like really slow and. I like don't pay attention to it and i've just been having like issues with you know, like what I talked about before and it's just like not feeling it, but you need to work, you know. And I was like. been happening frustrations of my boyfriend To be honest, and I feel like I was kind of mean yesterday. But I feel bad about it, but then. Okay i'll just tell you the whole. rundown basically like he came home from work and I was like I remember the day before he was like Oh, I want to go get a feeling in and out. And, but I had already made dinner, so I was like what do you want to get in and out today said yes like do you want me to pick it up, or like do you want to go together, he was like we can go together. So we're in the car it's fine you know we're like kind of messing around with each other um cuz I like he was like oh your windows dirty so I like the windshield wiper fluid on. To clean it, he was like you don't need that much water and then I just kept the water on because, although you don't need to tell me what to do, and he was like oh. Like we always have like like when he's driving I hate I hate when people tell me what to do on while i'm driving it's not just him, but like I was kind of fun with him and then why we're going to in and out. And on the on the drive there like at some point i'm kind of talking to him and we're listening to music and like after like maybe like five minutes or so he just likes it on his phone and he's like scrolling through tick tock. And it kind of annoys me, to be honest i'm. are like it, it makes me like angry, I guess, because. i'm the kind of person, where I that's just a pet peeve of mine, I guess, like, especially considering I think like i'm pretty busy generally you know so like if I want to spend time with you, I want to actually spend time with you. yeah if I can just talk to myself. I was like Oh, what is this one like so at that point, I was kind of like I would rather have like went alone, but then i'm driving and like I think during the drive. From after I picked up my food i'm like getting more and more angry as I think about it. And so, like once we get there um I think at some point, like we pass the park and he finds like so something he's like oh like. This he told me a story about like a guy earlier years ago, and this is why that happened and I was just like cool. And then I go to park and i'm like around the corner from the House and I was like you know you can just go bring the food up and i'll go park. And then he was like Oh well, he didn't bring his keys because we live together, so I have my keys, he was like oh I can't get in without your keys. And I kind of like roll my eyes and I was like Fuck and then, which was a very like I didn't mean to do that, you know it was just my reaction. And then I start like I miss a parking spot and then that was open, but I wanted to look for what up street and he was like oh there's this part this part right here, and I was like. No there's what there I tried to park, he was like Oh, are you sure that we can park here like this is someone there's someone's driveway right there and then i'm like forget it, and I like start driving a block to go back to the other parking spot and. While he was talking to tell me like Oh, are you sure you want to park here, I also like I turn the music up all the way. Oh volume and then he, like sets of the lcs at all like what are you doing now like ignored him because I don't want to talk to you anymore, and then he says that again and I was like a big parking. So, apart, you get into the House, and then I take my food and like he's in the living room gonna watch thor's game, and I was like i'm gonna go watch grey's anatomy and then I go to the. And then, while I was in the room, I was like I was kind of mean so, then I go out late and also i'm like you know can't get mad at him because he didn't tell him. They bought. When you're on the phone. And I went up to him later and like you know, but then I I started acting normal with him, like all like affectionate and whatever and then I was like. After I left again I was like so you just add out to them and then you're asking cool but also you never adjust like i'm pretty sure he knew I was upset like both didn't say anything about it. But. yeah those."
226.0,Provider,Are you okay so were you ever were you ever able to tell him like when you're on your phone.
11871.0,Patient,"No, and like. You like the reason to is because. I. don't like i'm I feel like he shouldn't. Like he should want to talk to me type of thing I don't want to because I also know how he is like he kind of. Does things like leisurely when you ask them like if he doesn't want to, because I think later I was like Oh, can you read my back because or like you know crack my back, is it hurts. He was like oh i'm kind of lazy and he was just going to like lay down like pat my back, and I was like you know i'll do it myself because that's not gonna do anything like you know that's not what I was asking you to do. Oh, I think yeah yeah like I don't know some. patterns, like, I said that he is kind of like he has asked us things. And so I don't want him to like put his foot down and then just sit there a little dry because I don't like. Being someone that like has you know is like on your ass like or."
226.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think they're Okay, so I think when it comes to phones and it comes to purples and it comes to it creates a lot of. phone can create a lot of issues with couples. And like I swear. yeah so there has to be. Communication around it, there has to be boundaries around it, there has to be expectations. So you know you have to at least let him know that when you're scrolling through tick tock you know it's a little annoying for me so do you think you could be a little bit more. Mindful of when you're with me and staying off your phone because I want to be able to have a conversation with you, I want to be able to talk to you. And and see what he says, you know you have to at least try and open up the conversation, because if you act out he doesn't really know why you're acting now. yeah that's that's that's not you're not you're communicating in your those are old patterns like though that's old you know that's you communicating in a way that's. unique you know that's a mature and it's it's like acting out yeah so those those are those are patterns and that you, you don't want to. You don't want to use those."
11871.0,Patient,"Well, honestly I wasn't really like trying to get a reaction out of him or anything like that was like oh like it back mad at him feel like put his phone down or whatever it was more so, like that was. My genuine reaction to him, like, I really like during that car I like I wanted him to get out like I want to be, I did not want to see him."
226.0,Provider,Like look at that and say okay what like you went from like zero to 60 like really like like What was it that really made you like want him out of the car where you just couldn't stand his presence and not moment.
11871.0,Patient,I feel like. Like it's probably like deeper than the phone practice.
226.0,Provider,"Yes, right. I think you're talking about something else the phones just sort of. You know that's just a part of it."
11871.0,Patient,"No, I feel like it's really like. I don't know, I guess, I have either I don't know if it is an insecurity or if it is like i'm. My intuition, or whatever it is, but I feel like this was kind of a filler relationship for him. Because he kinda like he is disengaged sometimes and like. I feel like I. Do more I guess generally like even just like for. Like he doesn't plan dates, because he has anxiety, apparently, and as I are like he doesn't like to plan things but i'm like Okay, I do too goofy and like. You know. Like he just kind of puts a lot of weight on me and I guess it's not. Like on the one hand, I know it's because, like he's kind of spoiled. mom literally does everything for him. And he will wash like he doesn't wash dishes at home, like she literally like like super spoiled and like I am the oldest child was like parents that weren't super President so instinct is to not do shit and then My instinct is to everybody. You know, it just works out that way and I like try to like backup for him. But at the same time it's like really frustrating in that part I did communicate to him, I was like I just because you're like also constantly asked me to like remind him of things and i'm like you know I have shitty memory like I feel like you just. Like things, and then the things that you do, you still need my help for like. And i've been seeing a lot of actually I was seeing a lot of videos about people where they're like you know there'll be in their marriage and then down the line, like. The wife, you know it's always like the wife doesn't want to have sex with me but it's like you're acting like a child, like a."
226.0,Provider,Little. Absolutely like reminding him is like a mom reminds the child to go pick up there boom. Make sure you have your backpack so if we can get out the door a mom reminds you okay don't forget to take a bath.
11871.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's how I feel so I told him I was like I get that you're new to like. The functioning adult but like it's very, but a lot of me know. And a recession actually like while he was at work before the Internet thing and so he was kind of like you know, like i'm trying, but like i'll try to like do more, or whatever, and I do see a key is you know he came home and he did the dishes because all working all day. Because isn't that I brought it up was because. He was like Oh, do you think you could like take the dog for a walk because he didn't in the morning and I was like. I work today and then he was like yeah that's why I said when you get a chance, and I was like I working nine to 530. I cleaned in the morning, so my lunch break is all the time, going to eat i'm not going to not eat sticky dog for a walk you know, which is a boundary that is new so that's cool I usually have that relationship with food because I put my hope on the bottom. But I was like yeah I know like do it, you know kind of like do it yourself but also yeah like what this behavior like with the phone it just kind of. And like not taking initiative for things. Like honestly like if I didn't do it, it wouldn't happen, which kind of makes me want to not do it to see which is obviously wrong, and I should just communicate, but at the same time, like. I feel like it would help them kind of see like okay you're not doing shit because now nothing's happening because i'm not doing it."
226.0,Provider,"So you know one thing that you said that. That stood out to me was that you feel like this is a filler relationship for him. yeah so that that must be kind of hard, if you feel like he's just with you for a. short period of timing."
11871.0,Patient,"yeah for like I guess just because he's like well you know because I don't know because i've made my life to the bottom, there from the start, but he's just kind of like well. she's here she's dealing with me, so I guess, this is what we're doing but i'm not feeling like the passion, you know I mean like the. But I know that's just like a chain of mine like that's what I expect for magically I, like you know the whole like for me i'm a very like I like to do like big grand gestures and like blah blah blah all that type of. yeah or you know, thoughtful gifts all that."
226.0,Provider,So do you feel that's really what's going on aren't you feel like that's kind of what you're thinking.
11871.0,Patient,"Honestly, I don't know because, like, on the one hand i'm like okay you've been an avoidant attachment for a while, so like maybe this is your way of like. distancing yourself from him by convincing yourself that he you know isn't actually into you to like as a safeguard but either hand, some of his behavior is like. giving me that sign like, why are you not like or he doesn't engage with you very much like when we're together. Like i'll just be like sitting on his phone I sometimes will be texting during the day, but it will be like really dry, and so I just kind of start to like like not reply because honestly i'm like that's what I would do with any other person. If you're not. anything to respond to them, not going to talk to you, and so I enabling him, which is a big thing I think i'm enabling a lot of his behavior that I don't like. That about it."
226.0,Provider,So do you think that is try text when he's working artist because he's working or is this kind of something that happens frequently me.
11871.0,Patient,"because sometimes i'm like okay he's busy and they're like he's not really like looking at his phone. yeah i'm like Okay, because you'll be telling me like oh it's really slow right now. And then. Like give me nothing so. i'm like what the Fuck um but yeah sometimes i'm just like Okay, or I don't know what to kind of close my mood, to be honest, because i'll be like when i'm really talking about something i'll be like all like. I don't know like more vibrant, I guess, and then after I realized that case not really like giving you the same energy back I just kind of like shut down. yeah I don't know but it's not even me being like. Like you know, using it as punishment or a way to. make a way to make you react, or something it's just like I it just drains me so i'm like okay."
226.0,Provider,"So. In what are your feelings around living with him, you feel like this was something that you jumped into are you going like this is something that you're really good like you you're happy, but you're just having working through some stuff."
11871.0,Patient,"For like a general the am happy because us like. I could like he does this and then he'll be like oh like I made you T and like you know it's cool. um like it's cool living with him, but at the same time i'm like. I guess i'm. If i'm wrong then i'm like Okay, this is, you know just a face, but if it's if I write that i'm like whoa. And i'm fucked up. yeah. Like in the middle, but at the same time i'm like it's not like it's always like that which is something. i've heard a lot from a lot of toxic relationships like it's not always like. Now, but. yeah like you, he is still at the same time, like very loving sometimes, but I feel like there are certain times, where he just doesn't engage me the way that I want which I guess could be like my own, having like my own expectation, but i'm still like. No way like you know how much you want to ask like Is this how you act with everybody."
226.0,Provider,yeah so that's a legit question you know because he might just be like What do you mean like he might have absolutely no idea how he's presenting itself.
11871.0,Patient,"yeah that's one thing I like wonder route because I mean i've only ever seen him when i'm there with other people. But like he's a little he's a little awkward you know so part of me is like this, I have something like something serious part of me is like caves fellowship doesn't really like he just there because. you'll be there and another part of me is like Well, this is like something that he could just do on his own you know because I remember early in our relationship. He was playing pokemon go while we're like walking around temp disco. But, and he was like oh i'm sorry like does it bother you that i'm on my phone and I was like no because he was really excited about there being like some rare pokemon or something over there. I was like go ahead catch pokemon dude it's cool but i'm like to take that is I don't care that he's ever on his phone."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
11871.0,Patient,i'm like I feel like men are so annoying do like very black and white.
226.0,Provider,yeah they are.
11871.0,Patient,"Either like okay cuz I know that's why another thing like I don't want to like it's gonna be for flushing because if i'm like I don't like to turn your phone he's gonna be like. Every time i'm around him, you know, even though that's not what I meant. so stupid."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so it's really about creating. An expectation like it's it's about creating some boundaries and just like verbalizing what your expectations are I mean. You know there's phone etiquette people don't understand what phone etiquette is so when you're talking to somebody even if you're in the same room somebody, why do you have to be on your phone to kind of understand what is that why. Like we're a society that you know our phone is like a second it's like a third hand. it's independent people can't put it down and that's not normal that's so not normal."
11871.0,Patient,"Especially because it's not even like all i'm texting my mom back it'll be like i'm scrolling through instagram or like something like that, like it's not it's it'll still be there. I mean, sometimes it isn't your mom but like."
226.0,Provider,"there's a difference, so if somebody says, you know what it's my mom I just have to get this I just need to text her via give me a minute or somebody like there's an email that comes through this important just give me a minute I just need to answer this email and that's it. That shouldn't be. You know that's all, then you can put your phone down, and you can engage there's an issue there's a major issue is that people don't know how to engage with each other anymore."
11871.0,Patient,"But. I mean I don't know I think it's also frustrates me because, like, I have not used to that and another thing too, I was thinking about was like I know my parents low key and I was younger like I go into the room and I tried to talk to them, and that was it. And so i'm like I feel like it probably like. triggers my inner child like why you think. But also, I was raised with my grandma who was like very like don't be on your phone when you're with other people So for me like if i'm with someone. i'm really bad at answering my phone. A like sometimes states Terrence we were literally exactly like he gets so like oh no I haven't texted like will immediately answer it and I just I do not engage with my very often so like um. But, so I guess that's like a whole like mindset difference. Because, for me, like my family like my grandmother was she'd be like party on your phone, even with all this like. which I think is normal like I said, and he and I spoke something and then she's like that route to have your phone at the table and i'm like you're literally nobody here, you know. But again, like, I think I was put with that and, like his parents just kind of let him."
226.0,Provider,Do whatever he wants.
11871.0,Patient,"Which is why, like, I think, a social etiquette is a little. yeah i'm I don't know what it is, I. I track mama's boys a lot."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. So you know it's really yeah and I it's like really you know what kind of men, are you choosing and why are you choosing them like, why are you choosing somebody that you feel like has a little bit of a little boy complex or. You know, really needs me to remind him to do things, and you know, like that's not adult like in your House like you're an adult. Like you don't need to be reminded you know put a sticky note put an alarm on your phone do something, you know take take responsibility for what you need to get done yourself i've got too many things in my head and too many things going on, I can't remember your step two."
11871.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no that's that's very. that's also our mountain, like you, because, and also, I guess, my fear is like the things that you know because i'm I work online I go to school online so Mike you think i'm like not doing shit all day. Like I don't like I don't know but yeah I think he does have a little boy complex and answer, I think I would have been done with it already like I personally like wouldn't care about us like like if I wanted to break up with him. I really wouldn't care about living with him like i'd be like Well, this is awkward but that's all I have to take you know, like. Oh, I think the only reason i'm like okay i'm dealing with it is because I do see that he. He has very capable of self accountability and like growth. Right like. I guess rashida with the process."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and it's a process living with somebody the process looking with somebody is really different than that then just add numb. Like if you take it to a whole new level like it's there's so many other things that you can tend to it. Like you're really get to know that person and you live with them and it's not like you can just go oh i'm going home, you know when you're bugging me. Like okay yeah i'm going to go home and i'll see you tomorrow, you know it's not like you can do that so you're just like forced to kind of either sit with it or communicate or work through it it's very different."
11871.0,Patient,"it's true so i'm like all my talk to actually I think he can obviously tell that i'm like upset because he asked me like oh like what's wrong I was like Oh, and to that after therapy."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and you know, and you want to be able to let him know you know you want to be able to say to him hey look, this is really. I got really bothered when you're scrolling through your phone and we were together yesterday. You know it triggers something in me and i'm just asking, can you be really mindful that I really don't want you on your phone when you're with me. You know I know certain things arise, I know you're going to have to text people back, but you know, can we both just be really mindful of that when we're together. You know so you're not jumping down his throat, you know you're kind of coming up with a solution and going hey is this going to work for you like can do, do you think you could do this."
11871.0,Patient,yeah okay that's good yeah just like to say such a nuanced like. The spots and we saw annoying but.
226.0,Provider,"Well it's because. You know it's because, when he was when you guys were in San Francisco and he was on his. Doing that pokemon and you're like yeah hey no yeah go ahead, you know, so what happened is like with that response you set the whole precedent like you set that whole thing up. You know so for how it's going now you know so interesting right, you know it's it's just like yeah some people just don't have that phone etiquette they don't understand you know the social skills, I mean I don't know that many people do. You know it's kind of a generational thing to you know you guys generation you guys grew up with phones like I you probably can't even remember a time when you didn't have a phone."
11871.0,Patient,"Well yeah those actually know if you still headphones. yeah yeah. But. yeah I guess that's like. Take one thing, but, honestly, I think of just beside him like maybe a hacker fix you know him because i'm not really. i'm not very motivated right now, to be honest. Even though. You know you got to live, or whatever you got to eat to live. Not to work. But I don't know, I do not care I just I just don't care right now. And I don't know if it's like because I don't feel like sad. I always try to say like I might have this. But like i'm not like sad I just don't want to do anything, or like. yeah like passively alive against my will not that i'm going to kill myself."
226.0,Provider,or taking are you taking that medication like what's going on with that.
11871.0,Patient,"I am I am back on medication. i'm on like the starter one, though, where I take five in the morning 25 at night i'm having been consistent with it at night, not gonna lie I have in the morning, so I don't know how that goes I guess it's like i'm starting myself on 25 pretty much instead of starting my cell phone. But that's another thing that really. Then I also have um. I got also birth control, so I know that. yeah just be me."
226.0,Provider,"Well, I think you've got to give them medication a chance, and I think you got to start taking it really. consistently like I think you have to you have like. Because I think, as I recall, when you were taking it consistently like you were doing. Like you felt."
11871.0,Patient,"yeah I was it's just I have to get back there, but I don't know what it is, I don't. I don't really want to do anything anymore just want to drink and like, even though I know that's like that I think i've been avoiding drugs completely because you know i'm like. super close like. You know, as I have, I think the last time was maybe a couple months ago I had like a I guess I didn't think of it as a vendor until and, like, I made a friend at a look at the club, I went to that day and then she was like Oh, I met her and like water vendor honestly. I would follow that. I went out with my cousin just to the bar 4pm and we didn't go home until like the next day stood. But go get a drink. yeah."
226.0,Provider,When was that.
11871.0,Patient,This was like. I think this was like maybe. I think December.
226.0,Provider,So the last month and.
11871.0,Patient,"But. or yeah I. think it was December, was it was after I was 21 all right cuz I got it no problem. But."
226.0,Provider,"So don't forget that that that affects you obviously. And and and what people don't realize, is that it has residual fat, you know it doesn't just go out of your system, I mean it's out of your system, who are to do a drug tests within 72 hours, depending on how much you've done but you know it does affect your mood."
11871.0,Patient,"No, no it's uh well, I honestly i've never been a ever been angry. person on it, but yeah I do, I honestly I don't know I don't think we bought into this, but I do have a history of. i'm abusing. But, like, I think it was worse than like undergrad. For sure um because I would like to mix things should not be mixed you know. That popped up my psyche little bit, but also, you have to be pretty fucked up to do that the first place."
226.0,Provider,"But what were you doing well, what were your main target choice."
11871.0,Patient,"um honestly I just do whatever anything but not perelman. But um I did like. TRIMs for a while, but got a couple of bad chips I haven't done it since I didn't like once in August, had a good trip and I was, like all right that's it we're done. undo that. And then I think the one that I will always fold for, though, oh no I won't say I will always but, like, I have always is Colin. I have not like five offered it honestly. i'm date. But like that's why like. And then we'd I did have a problem with doing it too much because I would like not just like the giant guys like a do it till I was like incoherent I think honestly I would, I just wanted to be in full hearing. yeah where i'm at right now, like I don't want actively participate."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so you're wanting to really check out and you're wanting to numb yourself you've got to ask yourself why am I wanting to do that Okay, why do I feel like I need to do that, why do I feel like I have to completely get lottery. So I don't have to think or feel so what is so overwhelming for you that you feel like you cannot work out on your own in a healthy way without turning to drugs or alcohol."
11871.0,Patient,liquor i'm just like set.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, what are you sad about."
11871.0,Patient,"You know, just like oh. My God I don't cry a lot sorry but."
226.0,Provider,Good to cry really good to cry.
11871.0,Patient,"I never really fully recovered from anything and like. So just a combination of the make file think with like your siblings and, like my brother is going to be fucked up when he grows up you know and like. Nothing I can really do about that. Like have this super job and like I don't like school, but I don't have talent so that's what I have to do. I guess I just feel kind of like stuck because, like. I go in I don't know, like, I want to kill myself, but I can't do it, because then my brother's gonna be more foot the. First, just have to like be here."
226.0,Provider,Are you feeling suicidal now.
11871.0,Patient,"I guess felt like i'm not good to do it, which, like is super. It was like I can't traumatize the kid you know."
226.0,Provider,So you're feeling really down you're feeling sad you're feeling maybe a little bit a little bit to prospect you don't necessarily have a plan or intention.
11871.0,Patient,to commit suicide oh.
226.0,Provider,Why do you think that your brother's gonna be pumped up.
11871.0,Patient,"cuz like. I know how about. After like you know, I was like somewhat victim of domestic violence and, like my mom you know. My. My dad step dad like I just feel like it all like. I just made some bad choices, and even then, I think, considering the circumstances I still did pretty well with like. I guess on paper, I did good so like there's at least that but Besides that, like i'm not doing well. And like his was even worse, like well like in some ways it's worse in some ways it's we had our own talents, I guess, but like. He was like in the car during that state so. he's gonna have complex about like you know. He was the only ones that like didn't die. And all like even like when I went to go visit my mom like or adopt off the puppy. And she started like crying and provoked and then I saw him like go run to her, and I was like. I was like that was kind of my fear because, like you know cuz I was her. Little therapy peck. And like no he's taken over were like he gets overly concerned about our feelings and. No as a consistent father, who was. Drug dependent I just feel like the odds odds are not in our favor you know, like realistically like he's already depressed it's like 11. I think it's just really talented up."
226.0,Provider,Is is he is it possible to get him with a therapist.
11871.0,Patient,He isn't therapy.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Well, no cuz you know he needs, you know what he went through was really, really traumatic and so he's you know he needs some help. understanding that and learning how to like talk about that and learning how to be okay, with his emotions around that and so you know what. You can say Oh, you know he's he's not going to come out well with the best who's going to be fucked up that doesn't that's not necessarily true. Because my like you're not locked out, you know you had a lot of really awful things happen, and you might have made some choices that you wish you hadn't made that that doesn't make you. It doesn't it doesn't speak to being asked up or broken, you might go broken inside, but you can fix that we can fix how you feel and. You know, being sad about this is good, because I think it's your you're making a breakthrough with with what we're talking about now and actually being able to cry about it. Because you know, working together for a while and you know the things that you've talked about are really, really difficult but you've gone through. And you know you're a perfect example of what you can do with hard work dedication perseverance staying in school hey that doesn't mean that that won't happen for your brother what it does mean is that you can be there for him and he will need you. And you can be there for him and say hey i'm here for you do you want to do anything you want to talk about i'm always here for you, you know I love you. i'm i'm i'm with you, so he knows that he has you okay okay. um you know, in terms of the job if you don't like the job find another job it's a hard job what your training correspond needs. it's not. Okay."
11871.0,Patient,"Even work kids yet that's the part I do it's all enjoy I just don't like the cookies but it's only good to get where stuff online I don't know because I feel like well, I saw my probation. And like so we'll see if he. Can kind of."
226.0,Provider,"Why don't. Why don't you start looking for something else if be considered doing that, or do you want to do wanna are you wanting to see this through that what your goal is your plan."
11871.0,Patient,"Well, actually, I have. I like. apply for jobs as a hobby sometimes I don't know why, like I can't just like relax like normal person, but. I started to do it because I got an offer from like some website that I put my resume on, and then I was like you know I always do this for like. I like I jumped ship a lot."
226.0,Provider,yeah it.
11871.0,Patient,"was like Okay, maybe, maybe try a little bit. In terms of what. I don't know I feel like the trendy it just slow. It bothers I don't know what it is like. This."
226.0,Provider,Is an aba training.
11871.0,Patient,"And like I did my like I did my actual training on it already like 40 hour training and like this whole week i've been like. What is it. Like where they do slideshows showing me the same shit I just learned right, I had a problem with this, maybe i've just worked."
226.0,Provider,"But yeah I was gonna say you know it's like you don't need to have that repetition, so what that's yeah exactly like you already got it the first time around, so the second time around, is going to feel really like painful."
11871.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's what it's like because that's what I always got in trouble in school and I always like I was pretty good kid but at the same time. I I talked a lot ido because I get. I get bored. And then. Like okay. And then I don't know so maybe that's all it is and Mike once I get to the actual field, because it's going to be so much different because it's not gonna be like what is what type of reinforcement is this. You know. it's gonna be like actually like you would kiss and you're like oh shit he just beat me or whatever. So."
226.0,Provider,"So also here's my my my two cents is the issues that you're having with your boyfriend or probably related to what we're just talking about now the phone issue is probably yeah okay. But I think there's an underlying stuff is what we're just talking about. So you know being really mindful around like Okay, is this my boyfriend or Is this something else that's happening because if you're taking it out on him your."
11871.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,Your anger is really saddens your anger is really unprocessed sadness around what you've been through what's happened.
11871.0,Patient,that's true.
226.0,Provider,"And so, wanting to wanting to just drink and do drugs is really about wanting to just not have to feel what you're feeling but here's the thing if you feel what you're feeling you move through it faster. When when you numb yourself out like that it takes tanya it takes a lot longer you're adding time to this process."
11871.0,Patient,that's true.
226.0,Provider,"So obviously there's a difference between you know social drinking and going on a bender. So when you're going on a bender you're you're hurting ourselves physically mentally and emotion your body can't handle the body wasn't meant for us to go on vendors or stay up for two one or two nights doing coke. It it really puts us out of whack and I really respect that you're being honest about it because we can talk about it, and I have no judgment around that. You know, but the more information I have, and the more I am able to help you and I know it's not easy to say stuff like that takes a lot of courage so. You know just and I think like once you talk about it to it kind of takes the power out of it like it takes that kind of secret out of it and saying Okay, well, I put it out there, that I feel like just going, and you know going on a bender so like talking about it kind of tells it all."
11871.0,Patient,yeah it's not it's not exciting.
226.0,Provider,Like. Like that she already knows.
11871.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"yeah So it goes back to just doing those things that really make you feel good. You know you're just working through some stuff you're working through some sadness you're working through some low self esteem you're working through trauma it's not easy, so when you are in this place you got to go back to the things that make you feel good about you. Exercising I don't know yoga meditation you know things that going outside going for a walk laughing."
11871.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's that's one thing too, I think, like kind of. When I don't like being in the House is that I like to dress up do I make good yeah I think. kind of just it in my pajamas all day."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
11871.0,Patient,"you're like shit. yeah look. Look, my face on zoom i'm like look like. yeah like this right now."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and are you going to be out in fields in are you gonna be like, is it is it, are you going to houses like are."
11871.0,Patient,The clinic to.
226.0,Provider,Okay right.
11871.0,Patient,"So the client, which will decide yet so but yeah it will be. It will be going out in the field, I. Think that's another I think that's like another reason, even though i'm like oh you don't plan dates and it's not really about dates because i'm perfectly happy to be in house, I just want to like. feel something. But."
226.0,Provider,"Then, when when Okay, when will you be in the field."
11871.0,Patient,"um I honestly don't know I still need to do my like observation. But just be within the next couple weeks I don't I don't think that they should. I don't think that they be wanting to keep paying me to like. So, like probably with the next couple weeks."
226.0,Provider,"You know, and maybe like going out if you feel like going out if you feel like getting interest and getting dressed up you know go do something with your boyfriend like go do something, you know, like that's not that expensive but you're just out. You know."
11871.0,Patient,"Go get something to eat that's true I feel like it's just like a lot of the people close to me are, but the call home buddies. yeah even from like my friend your colleagues are like I just want to like let's have to take back to the House and i'm like no."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11871.0,Patient,"Like yeah but then also like at least like you know. I it's cool like he likes to be at home, my best friend also she's like she's like i'm tired and I get it work is tiring you know but it's like I like it's so weird like i'm an introvert were like i'm kind of shy but i'm also an extrovert like I like to go out and like me. Things and. I don't really have like a lot of extrovert for do I do maybe I need to make new friends. God damn it."
226.0,Provider,"Well, and I also I also think, just because of how it's still being around I think that's really keeping people inside more it's keeping people from really going out and doing things that they would normally have done. yeah you know I, and I that that's going to be changing like I, I think that we're moving into. You know. something different, with that."
11871.0,Patient,yeah it's like normal now I guess.
226.0,Provider,So now just remember that self care and remember those coping skills that we talked about.
11871.0,Patient,yeah. You get back on it.
226.0,Provider,"and also the medication that's like I really feel like honestly I feel like that's a really important component, I can really truly feel like that is something that helps you."
11871.0,Patient,"ya know, I was, I was, I had a period of doing well, I think I just kind of like. X what. What did happen, I. think it was just a lot of things going on in my life and. at once, and my freaking car. Now Alice for like a lot."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
11871.0,Patient,"yeah what happened to me. In a really busting buzz it's been a really wild six months yeah. But that's just like kind of. Like my life is always besides college honestly. Like or like undergrad, I guess, and even then, I feel like there's all like I feel like there's always something going on for me whether like some sort of social drama economic family like some Jordan tragedy like. Like I can't catch a break."
226.0,Provider,"yeah now that's the deal so and. And you know I still think that you're you're really going through some of the grieving process and not accident, and you know, remember that the grieving is it's not linear and it shows that in different ways and different stages of grieving so. don't forget that yeah."
11871.0,Patient,"that's true. I don't really think that's a big river in our life. It over per se. I guess. easier to commit because i'm like whoa from you know if it was like okay like there's some things you just cry about it, one time and you're like all right, because sometimes I would just cry and then just thought it a bit you know they can't really do that sometimes yeah."
226.0,Provider,"There you know this is this is, you know. The grieving around something like this take some time. And you're right it's something you're not going to forget. But you know can get a little bit easier. But it takes time."
11871.0,Patient,yeah it's true.

11871.0,Patient,"not sure. I wouldn't really. yep so I like I like complain about work in school, but that's, the only thing that like. I have to say."
