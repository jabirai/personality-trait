16492.0,Patient,i'm well.
760.0,Provider,"Good my name is Lisa. gonna be working together, the purpose of this meeting cherish. is to. know one another and especially for me to kind of know what it is. pretty much the things you've been struggling with some of the things you've been working on. Maybe some strengths, that you have as well um but before we get started in that process can you just share for me what you're hoping to get from treatment what what you'd like to gain for your own self."
16492.0,Patient,Just. A lot. i'm actually searching for a lot.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"And that's kind of what pushed me to actually get into therapy i'm hoping that I can just kind of you know, get like some outside guidance in and just like help with just general things because i'm a single mother and. You know I have. Partial guardianship over my sister that i've had for a couple years now she's now. And then, I have a five year old."
760.0,Provider,So you have one child that's your own and then you're you're.
16492.0,Patient,my sister daughter I call it my sister daughter.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so i'm hearing that maybe you've got a lot of stressors going on in your life, a lot of things kind of weighing you down worries. Maybe you're not sure what direction you should take in some aspects Okay, so this is what i'm sensing this right i'm glad to see that you're agreeing with me. Okay."
16492.0,Patient,"That is hard for me to put my finger on it, because sometimes I try to. Because i'm an over thinker, I tried to like narrow it down, but then I had to realize that maybe it's not just one thing, it is a lot of stressors you know and in not even knowing that. I put myself in those situations, you know, but just helping me to like. see them and then not feel so bad about five decision about it, without the influence of others opinions or my decision."
760.0,Provider,"For you, when we say others i'm assuming we are referring to family members."
16492.0,Patient,and friends.
760.0,Provider,And OK.
16492.0,Patient,"The next to you guide me wrong, you know that's just one of those extra periods, one of those other outside of themes."
760.0,Provider,Is this the Co parent to your daughter sister or a sister daughter I can't remember how you which way you phrased it.
16492.0,Patient,"No, I don't have a Co parent to her."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you are the guardian, then. So then people there's the, so this is legal guardianship i'm assuming legal in the Court kind of guardianship so you've been trusted to be the parents, so that makes you know just because she is your quote unquote was it sister daughter daughter sister."
16492.0,Patient,Is my sister daughter.
760.0,Provider,her daughter okay so.
16492.0,Patient,"Because we share the same father, we don't share the same mother."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay so yeah. Okay, so you but you've taken this on and the Court has agreed with you that you're the one you're the authority and just because she's biologically your half sister."
16492.0,Patient,You know you will show you that you're the Guardian. The Guardian that's my daughter that's.
760.0,Provider,kind of makes you the legal mother.
16492.0,Patient,"I am the mother. I am caring for a child that is under the age of 18 that by law, Canada do anything for her so without a garden."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, I understand, so so maybe but. But there's maybe there's some pressures that are put on you, because of the biology that she's not biologically your daughter just. Legally, you know."
16492.0,Patient,"me today more. it's more so of of her mental and emotional well being that takes a big toll on me. Because we've lost loved ones. Over this pandemic last year that we just kind of had an anniversary on. That really hit hard for her, you know as well as that hits harder for me. You know, on top of also. Those same feelings that she has. In the."
760.0,Provider,Past who passed.
16492.0,Patient,"So, so when it came to her, she was with our shared grandmother and grandfather. When she got took it out of the home from our Father she ended up staying with our grandparents. And then her brother. from her mother's side We grew up with him since elementary school so before my father and mother. and her mother even decided to start dating we already knew her son so then he became our brother We grew up with him, and then they had her so we now kind of like share but he's not biologically are but, but now we share brother as well. He dies in October of last year due to gun violence. And then."
760.0,Provider,you're saying you're referring to here brother.
16492.0,Patient,her brother her.
760.0,Provider,Her biological brother by okay.
16492.0,Patient,"Yes, because I didn't I didn't get the luxury of being raised in the home with her, I got raised at home with my mother so she grew up with her brother, which we move from elementary."
760.0,Provider,her brother.
16492.0,Patient,"On it so, is it right, everything is like really, really, really tight knit here."
760.0,Provider,"So, even though the biology may be different, there is, there is an emotional sense."
16492.0,Patient,"As we. grew up with him to her ministry school before he became. Family and then from step family because they actually got married my mom me his mom her mom my dad actually got married, so there actually was. You know, we actually bought it as a family grew up together in the whole nine does she came in, you know my sister daughter, she was the. The additive to that you know as we became teenagers she came around when I was 10 so you know you're all kind of around that age when she joined our family, so he died do the gun violence, a year ago in October and then our grandmother. That raised her. died in December of last year and then."
760.0,Provider,"Her 20 2020 okay Okay, around this time last. Year them so."
16492.0,Patient,we're on the one year anniversary.
760.0,Provider,"And that was a. That was due to cove it. No, I was something else okay."
16492.0,Patient,"And then, a freak accident her husband. ended up dying, right after that, so the grandfather that raised her that was connected to us ended up dying in February. On February 5 which is three days before my birthday February 8 so that kind of you know, and she 1415 experiencing. Three back to back deaths like this, you know, on top of this, the fact of all of her background that she went through you know I carry a lot of a lot of that emotional weight. Because the grandmother that passed away i've always had conversation with her, since I was young, young young back then. Because I knew how my dad was knew that her mom was I told my granny and like I need to get her like. She has to come with me like I was going to be a snitch i'm going to go to court and do whatever I can do to get her and my cousin forever it, this was a forever during that i've always had. You know, to make sure that she did not experience or have the life that I had been with she end up having something maybe I can say that was a lot worse, so I deal with a lot of her bottled up emotional stress and her being a 15 year old so teenager and emotion."
760.0,Provider,"And if i'm if i'm hearing you right you, you also relate to the to the psychological stress. What you went through well in the same way she's triggered. With her teenage brain you're triggered with your adult brain fair to say. Okay."
16492.0,Patient,"So I take it easy on her I try. And i've tried different methods, and you know just not knowing with the stress that I carried on from like work and being a single mom you know my year, my first year so we're her. was nice but I probably wasn't the nicest not knowing that I wasn't the nicest not saying that I was mean, but it was more so, like my delivery and just having the lack of energy. To like. You know, be in a good mood type of thing. So it was really hard to to to cannot kind of like help her get out of her stage. Because i'm. In such a wet myself is really I just need the ropes really to be strong, that I could be strong, for her you know. so that I can guide her her right but it's like i'm broken in a lot of the places that she's broken and then on top of that all of. Everything that i'm going through is it's like i'm trying to find the median on ongoing about situations, the right way or making sure that i'm not overthinking situations and not bring in my bottled up emotions into something that doesn't need to be. You know type of thing and it got to a point where it was overwhelming to hold in certain emotions on like we got to figure it out."
760.0,Provider,yeah well that's that's. A whole lot of grieving that you do have rights.
16492.0,Patient,That I hadn't really been able to breathe without you know cuz i'm a mom I gotta keep going there's no time to you know.
760.0,Provider,"yeah, but when we bottle up our grief it, it does one or two things it's gonna you know it's going to build up kind of like a coke bottle that you put in the freezer and if you leave it there long enough, it explodes. or. or it will kind of implode and and you can start you know, having some physical symptoms from you no harm in your body depending on where it is you're carrying your emotions. So grieving you know, demonstrating for her how to grieve or maybe even that it's okay to grieve might be an important important first step, I don't know how you were raised when it comes to expression emotions, because not allowed to express certain emotions."
16492.0,Patient,"Not that just not really having that outlet, you know my mom went to active alcoholic when. You know my brother. You know, he had his his mental issues and then she also my mom has another daughter, so I also have a 20 year old sister as well. She she as well, was in that family and and she was Okay, you know she had taken care of through her grandparents on her father side. You know my mom kind of focused on her and whatever issues my brother had going on, so I kind of was left with that middle child syndrome. To kind of like figure it out, on my own, so I I think I use different sources of like screaming for attention as a child, so I have a lot of childhood traumas that kind of like roll on to my adult team, and my decision making."
760.0,Provider,"Though that perhaps. You mentioned which parent did you say, with an alcoholic father."
16492.0,Patient,Both of them.
760.0,Provider,Both both parents were alcohol.
16492.0,Patient,And the stepfather was two.
760.0,Provider,"And a stepfather okay so so share with me chairs, what kind of abuse, do you think you went through views could be anything from physical neglect emotional verbal sexual."
16492.0,Patient,"Day, it was a lot more. Like emotional neglect. So it was just like you know just just feeling very absent, you know, like not not necessarily not fitting in but not getting the attention that the other children around God are not feeling as equal you know i've always felt that way. But that will I feel like you know. I didn't get the attention from my mom that I probably needed as a child, because she was so you know drawn into you know her her things in her issues. That you know me and her now are having conversations, to this day about how I felt as a child, you know and she's like wow I never really felt that way you know when the conversations came up to where you know my brother. She end up having a conversation with my brother, where there was a story, where I. Not that I wasn't wanted, but I wasn't wanted, and I was up for abortion and but my grandmother ended up talking into keeping me. I know that's her side of the story, but it's just like I know, being a mother that ended up keeping a child, not in the best situation I can. I can kind of maybe understand like what some of her thoughts. of me being around you know as a reminder as a second reminder to me that isn't nothing you know, and I kind of felt like she didn't mean to, but I just kind of feel like I was not. loved in as much as the others were you know because I didn't get as much, and I had to you know figure figure a lot out for myself and. And so it just you know it's kind of kind of hard so my grandmother her mom is cut she was kind of my outlet, you know she was the one that I was able to call when I was young and felt like running away and. Things like that so she was kind of the one that help steer me straight, you know that kind of kept me on guidance, but they're still been like countless of just like emotional trauma due to her alcoholism next still follows me to this day. So it's just like."
760.0,Provider,"You know okay. Okay, what about your own substance abuse or substance use."
16492.0,Patient,"Like alcohol. Because of that, you know I have such a big drinker. Like usually drink like for fun, but then again I don't like to be dizzy out like the effects that'll do for me, so I tend to to go to marijuana."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"I do my outlet, because I can control that that type of high you per se like you know i'm still able and i'm functional, I can still work fast paced like it doesn't delay me, you know. And then i'm able to put it down. Okay, if me."
760.0,Provider,"Alright, so do you think there's there's there's a kind of break up substance use into kind of three different categories just just for your education. Like using a substance would be like to use it occasionally, but not to cross over into abuse next step over could be substance abuse, where. Maybe you're using it to cope with things that you're can't cope with otherwise and then for some it crosses in like your parents, for instance substance use disorder where it becomes like an addiction, where it kind of takes over. uh huh which of those three categories, do you kind of see yourself in your your marijuana use."
16492.0,Patient,"um I would say, using in coping."
760.0,Provider,Some maybe abuse.
16492.0,Patient,"You know. I wouldn't say so, because I can put it down and and I can function without it for a couple of days, but. I feel like with why I also got the psychiatrist I know my brother was diagnosed with ADHD I don't know my father was diagnosed but i'm pretty sure that man got some issues, too, and I know my mom has been diagnosed with some things to as well. So just like. Genetically there's a possibility that or the fact that I have ADHD, so I think that's probably where my line comes in, with why i'm able to function off marijuana. Okay, you know kind of like calm those thoughts and like slow things down for me so that I can focus."
760.0,Provider,"Well, let me ask you another question if if you were to just for argument's sake, to put down the marijuana and go for like a period of time, a month two months, whatever without using it, how else would you cope. What would you do to cope with the emotions and the stress without it that's that's."
16492.0,Patient,Tobacco.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"I will go find a cigarette or black real quick. Okay. Like wearing it but. Like without substance, I would. I wouldn't lose my mind, but because i'm a constant over thinker and because there's a lot that goes on in my head constantly it it. My as the years went by i've noticed that my patience has drawn shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter so as you see my face when you said, a month i'm like a month, I could probably go a couple days. away with I just I just want to know, I wanted to the purpose for this question is."
760.0,Provider,"You know, one of the destructive."
16492.0,Patient,Things iot and. Everything yeah you know I will. I will probably paste back and forth for. us so it will be super hard. I yeah.
760.0,Provider,That would be.
16492.0,Patient,"Better but it's doable but it's just like. With the fact that I kind of think that I do have some type of ADHD or like something's going on in there and I don't have that other positive outlet because I never seek the help for it, you know because I kind of just found myself remedy. You know so that's kind of why i'm on this venture. Here okay. To give that."
760.0,Provider,"One of the just, from my perspective, one of the things destructive things that I think substance use does is it we we we tend to rely on any type of. I would use the term maladaptive way to cope could be eating could be substances could be gambling could be too much Internet too much TV too much you know those kinds of things, and then we don't learn the healthier more balanced. way other way. And so that's part of the reason for my questioning just just in full disclosure. So, and so you've kind of touched on you think you have ADHD have you been diagnosed."
16492.0,Patient,"i'm so I talked to the psychiatrist. Not too long ago and kind of just had like a general assessment, but I do have follow up appointments with her."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"So you were on it. So i'm pretty sure with them first set of questions cielo there's something going on up there, so."
760.0,Provider,"And what other mental health. Problems or situate what else, are you struggling with."
16492.0,Patient,"Anything else with some, then I have my child's father. He in that long relationship was very traumatizing."
760.0,Provider,verbally physically.
16492.0,Patient,"In war verbally and emotionally. It was a lot of just like verbal abuse and just like being young and not having like the father figure type of thing and it just like. It was, it was a lot, and then I ended up pregnant at the end of it, and then I went through a lot of. Deciding with that and then, and then we try it again after the baby was born, but that ended up. Getting diagnosed with schizophrenia. and Then that wasn't very pleasant to deal with either on top of the fact that he already wasn't emotionally great for me and just as a partner anyways. Then I kind of I have left him for my son was about three months, then I had to move back in with my mom and stepdad and the drinking and then that's kind of when I really pushed to venture out on my own, but. I deal with a lot of that emotionally, because I, I now have a son that I feel like has. Some things once he gets a little more aware i'm probably going to put him in therapy to as well. Just because I know he's been through a lot he's seen a lot through, just like the alcoholism to as well, like not like being a sponge of it all but not knowing how to express his little tidy emotions about certain things. In just he's been through a lot like and I know that his mental probably is that the state of mind, because mommy's and what he sees every day. So I feel like he's just as nervous, as I am sometimes."
760.0,Provider,So am I hearing that you're feeling some anxiety any any any kind of worry you do you think there's been a like an effect on your mental health because of all this trauma.
16492.0,Patient,"A lot of it is is from the trauma. And, just like the the emotional trauma that came from the father was a lot more like. With my insecurities and things that didn't help with me just like emotionally and just how I always felt about myself, you know. He didn't help with that part of my mental along with. It along with now having the thoughts of like my son can't even really have a father, even if we decided to co parent because that's not dead, you know that has issues. So now, I have to be careful and i've had to make a lot of like financial choices from from being assistant manager some shop manager to haven't quit that to be in a wax colleges, to now, not even. Not even being able to mentally work because I can't be there for my children in the needs that they need me here which a lot of them are physically and emotionally. And, and he doesn't want me to leave, and I feel like he has attachment issues and. I feel like a lot of that is just drawn from like the abuse that he's heard and kind of like witness just between me and his father and just like everything that goes on. So it's just a lot with with with like trying to figure out how about to raise this little boy by myself with this gets a frantic father and not really being male figures around to help guide him it's all women to just as. type of thing you know. OK."
760.0,Provider,"And then, so in it. So in addition to everything that you carry from your own past your own trauma you seem to. feel responsible or wanting to help or wanting to change or support I don't know fill in the adjective with. Your kids too. And yeah so you're carrying light of your stuff on top of. It there is definitely."
16492.0,Patient,"Having the work. life and personal balance, you know, whereas a lot of people look for just like that work in life is like with the traumas that my children have went through. And the traumas that I would do as a child and having those absent parents in seeing how I turned out, I know that's not the best way to go. And I know people it's like well, you have to work yeah you have to work, but you also have to understand the the emotional and mental state that your houses eat. You know your head household in and it's just you and you have your kids over here basically crying for help, like what you do go to work or do you make sure that your kids mentors Okay, so that they can function."
760.0,Provider,kind of an impossible choice. They they're they're both. Equally. Important.
16492.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
760.0,Provider,But they they're opposed seemingly some.
16492.0,Patient,"And then is it's didn't just me, though, you know if it's like, if I have my village then maybe like it'd be a little easier, but my village is a holic mother. I have my one friend that's also a single mom to three children that already helps with the baby, you know and it's like I don't really get the help. With nobody with my sister and the crazy thing is my dad still causes we still talk to him, but does he do anything for us much to the point where it helps me out mentally no. I don't I don't have the I don't have the support that I need I can't say that I want because i'm grateful for what I have you know because I can have nothing. But for what I need or what I expected people to pull through they're not so, then that way he's out on me it's just me everything trickles down to just me. grateful for the 20 year old sister, because when her and my mom end up having to move me for ago and she was here, you know she took on a lot of like. The financial part of getting my sister kind of things that she desired you know so like those super expensive shoes and the. Extra fancy clothes, you know she stepped in with that, so I was really grateful. For her to you do that, but I know in the 50 year olds mind is she probably expect that to come for me so it's probably you know I don't think she understands what I provide for her. And then, sometimes her reciprocation of that is kind of like shitty, but I think that's a 15 year old that's that teenage babe I go with, but then that's hard on me because i'm only 24 trying to understand. The life of the attitude of the 15 year old being that I was just there but understanding how to deal with that as well, and not taking it so personal when she doesn't understand what I really go through mentally and what i've had been through mentally you know. And then I also have to understand that she's been through a lot to. You know so."
760.0,Provider,it's just.
16492.0,Patient,"sad and it's like talking circles. is constant over and over and over again, and just makes it harder and harder and harder to figure out like, how do you deal with it, you know, like another stressors is just the fact that California so freaking expensive, you know."
760.0,Provider,Where do you live.
16492.0,Patient,I mean we're.
760.0,Provider,really only oh okay.
16492.0,Patient,"yeah i'm in Vallejo California and i'm paying what 21 or two bedroom here. My son moves himself until their home because he i'm pretty sure he now owns his own room, but he said, all my stuff is in here okay that he's five so he's super cute so he's just like this is my room now okay that's fine, but then, in my head is like I can't even provide that for camp. You know, because it's so expensive he goes to school in oakland so that it makes it easier for the friend to pick up because he goes to same school to friends kids she goes to school in Richmond so it's kind of like a A, B and C way out, but it's. The it's the the mental and physical toll that it takes because I also worked in San Francisco forever, so we went from Vallejo to Richmond to oakland to San Francisco to Berlin game. South San Francisco i'm going to send all day and all the way back to the layout everyday everyday everyday. Six o'clock in the morning shift to crazy stuff I had to let that go i'm like I can't do this anymore, and I ended up getting new job to alameda. it's better, but it took a financial pay cut you know somewhere from assistant manager to now just a regular employee that bare minimum wage and then it's, just like in charts make that easier, so now i'm just like i'm. On the route to figure out how I can get my 15 year old a little more independent, to help take that stress off, you know. So i've already got her working on catching a bus to the friend's House so that makes it easier for me as half days. blocks schedules has about. four different times, if she gets out during the week he gets out at 130 and then I see traffic. And then my schedule was up down up down up down up down one day off up there, and it. can do it, so I had to i'm like what do I do, and so I asked them for for help mentally and they were just like oh we've been there before you got it. And i'm just trying to understand really you don't do you so it's like do I clear like what do I do and and that was another thing it's like it's really hard to work this hard to work with anxieties that I have to go into."
760.0,Provider,"court, you are having you are having anxiety on a daily."
16492.0,Patient,"basis 100%. there's always a huge elephant sitting on my chest forever okay. You know, like for a lot of that to get relieved, you know. And i'm hoping that comes with the mirror thing you know if someone. God rest her soul she's so cute my son's great granny she needs to tell me girl you so nervous why you guys so nervous oh my God, what are you talking about i'm not nervous. But I understand what she's talking about because i'll be happy like i'm not I always. perceived nervous to be like oh i'm scared to go somewhere like oh i'm scared to do something like I thought that that when she said that i'm like what is she talking about what did she mean i'm so nervous. But then that was just her old old older way of saying my anxiety like why you. Like like a sit down. Like why can't you be still like you know, like come out we'll get you all over the place girl, you know. kind of like put those two together. to the point where yeah it's a lot it's just a whole lot."
760.0,Provider,well.
16492.0,Patient,And that's not even start that's like that's like short stories of all the long stories.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay well, one thing that I could suggest for you to start considering start thinking on. is to try to learn to separate in your brain, these are the problems that I have that I can make choices about that I can change that I can make improvements on. And these are the problems that I cannot. You know I gotta change I change my mind."
16492.0,Patient,"That I can buy and I think that's where I get most. depressed about this because there, I cannot or is is, I cannot end the time that I needed to be done, yes."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah."
16492.0,Patient,A lot of different story.
760.0,Provider,"The from the from the story that you told me, you seem to at a very young age, you know from my perspective, i'm way older than you are 25 is super young, you have the maturity of a much older person. And you seem to be very creative utilizing. The things the strengths and the resources that you have to navigate this really rough difficult in some ways. Difficult choices, or you know, like you said i'm choosing between working and."
16492.0,Patient,"attending to my cancer, mental health."
760.0,Provider,"Those that's kind of like an it's really in my book it's an impossible choice their own, of course, equally valid."
16492.0,Patient,"But the part where I get stuck out right now is so just a little bit on the brighter side due to all of the things i've been through I graduate high school early. And since I graduated high school, I think it was a. It was just a quarter, so I ended up finishing three months before everybody else finished and I went straight into Cosmetology. When I went into Cosmetology I ended up having to take a break, because I had the hoop see with the baby. And having him, and then I went back in. And finished and i've been licensed for what about five years now, so when I was working in San Francisco. I was working at the dry bar have you heard about Dr are we do round brush blow outs."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16492.0,Patient,"So I worked there for three and a half years and in for two and a half of them I was assistant manager. And then I ended up leaving there because of the emotional stress that did not help with. What I was going on with that home in the time that I was there I was it was 15 hour days like you know that was the quite seven o'clock morning shift. At the time, my mom had her place, I was taking my sister to my mom's house four or five o'clock in the morning, taking my son to my friend's house to get me on Bart to get to the city and time to go to work. I did, that for about two and a half years I realized it's not doing it, I can't do this anymore. And then they have the nerve to say they need people they want people there that want to be there for the business and now for the pay. And I giving them my own, that was the new district managers that's what happened, it was new people that didn't understand me and what i've all sacrifice for the business. And this is when I ended up in Berlin game, so I was driving from Vallejo to Berlin game, every day, you have to American tell me that I you want me here for the business not gonna pay girl get out here. So, then, I ended up kind of leaving me a bad taste, so I followed that old district manager from dry bar to this place called lunchbox wax where i've learned how to wax this past time but she kind of sugar coated. How the scheduling was going to go and that's how I got the up down up down and it's a four week schedule so each week is a different week."
760.0,Provider,So that's awesome what's a different week by week and have a consistency. With your family yeah.
16492.0,Patient,"Exactly so then that's where the greater insight is grew. And they didn't understand that and they didn't want to work with that. So i'm just like well, I just have to go get some help them, but I. could never quit i'm like I can't quit I rather just take a leave and get some help see where my hope leads me but still have my job so it's not like I leave oh."
760.0,Provider,"So you're in you're on a leave of absence, right now, so you're. not working."
16492.0,Patient,"They didn't want to give me a leave of absence I had to go to my doctor and tell them how depressed and how high my anxiety was and she wrote me a note until I seen you guys. Okay, and I, and now I have to figure out what i'm going to do, but I don't think that they think that i'm going to come back."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"Due to how bad. Not I wasn't bad, but I was emotionally tore up when I left, so I don't think they have any signs of having me back, but I am on a note."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you okay."
16492.0,Patient,So that's another anxiety is going back to that how am I gonna juggle that with the everyday and. yeah you know.
760.0,Provider,"Well, perhaps, perhaps there's a better position for you. I don't know. You know, you can you can work on your mental health, and you know this is like they say all over the news that that they're in need of workers everywhere, so this is your time to. Look, for a better way because. You know, life is about life is about balance it's not it's not about somebody it's not healthy to. Go to work and give everything to your job to the expense of yourself in your own self care and the expense of the care of your children that's not what it's about. And the second you burn yourself out are they going to give even half of what you gave to for that business. know that is so. So one of the important healing things terrorists is just to recognize I need to put boundaries up. And that's my cousin my life. And my life."
16492.0,Patient,I don't have any.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"Well, it seems like you. And I need help. Finding them, so I don't. find myself in these situations."
760.0,Provider,You know you seem to put up a good boundary with taking your lead that was about.
16492.0,Patient,Well yeah because that was my straw straw that broke the camel's back I couldn't do it anymore.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay so okay so maybe maybe that's an area we can focus that we can focus on that area but. You do have. it's in there, maybe you maybe it's just hard for you to verbalize do you think you go, do you think that you're the kind of person that wants to kind of go and. You know, help help other people, whether you're at work or you like."
16492.0,Patient,"yep. Okay, definitely."
760.0,Provider,"All right, just just we're going to get into that this this appointment is kind of a getting to you know you i'm going to make a note. to you about that we're going to. do some talking about. What."
16492.0,Patient,"happened was, I have to pick a subject today. Yes, this kind of, and then you have to help me stay on track with it, though."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"there's like one thing to lead to somewhere else to. Somewhere somewhere else, and I think that's part of."
760.0,Provider,The the.
16492.0,Patient,The focus.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay so. you've you've covered I like the way that you've shared this story because i've got a whole list of. Questions in front of me and touched on most of them already chairs, so I."
16492.0,Patient,Like that I would agree presented in the way that.
760.0,Provider,"That works for you and that kind of gives me a better sense of us, so I appreciate that. But I do have one question talk to me about your self esteem not not as you a mother, but you as as a woman, you terrorists. talk."
16492.0,Patient,"Well, it started when I was younger. Because I I don't I felt like I wasn't as pretty as everybody else was per se. Because I didn't have the things that they had you know the the accessories the closed, so it kind of started off with that. Whereas it's crazy because i've had all the family and all the friends always surround me tell me i'm so beautiful so it's like why to have the opposite thought in your head when you have. Countless countless countless people telling you the complete opposite people alliance and CARDS, you know. But it's just. You know I don't know I don't know where they I don't know you know I don't know if it was just if it comes from. me not having or not ever being like the highest popular so like always having those, like the grading. Like small words like that kids throw around I think that's kind of where it started, then I was like overweight, a little bit, and then I kind of like carry that on alive, so my thoughts of me were always the lowest why I have no clue. Then and. Just like came from, like the emotional traumas."
760.0,Provider,But don't you tell me earlier in this conversation that. You felt less valued or less love. In a home.
16492.0,Patient,mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,"So when especially a child. Has this feeling, and this thought they kind of. I don't know we have a tendency to kind of seek it out everywhere we go."
16492.0,Patient,For her.
760.0,Provider,"And, and then the then it kind of comes like self fulfilling prophecy kind of thing the more I see it, the more I believe it then it affects my emotions and then there's this cycle this."
16492.0,Patient,circle.
760.0,Provider,full circle make sense. yeah so. So yourself a stream is kind of programmed in that way.
16492.0,Patient,But yeah.
760.0,Provider,"But at a very young age you're finding yourself, so I think okay so we'll work on self esteem to i'll make a note about self esteem as well, I do want to talk to you about some adult children of alcoholics. Things. we'll talk about that as well. me see never had any thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself or others."
16492.0,Patient,"I always do want to beat people up not like that, but. So so sometimes I really want to punch the bag, but I only want to kill I can't I can't even kill a freakin okay. I love it I love books but I. had my friend um. I forgot what she was what she said they were, but there were times and my life, where I was either so down or so at rage that. That I didn't want to be here like i've had times, where you know, I just wish that I can kind of just like melt away. I know there was a few times with my child's father, when I was with him that I was just like so done with like our situation in our and just like my life at the time I was driving so it'd be times, where like I thought about cashing but i'm too scary if that makes sense. Sometimes, with rage I wish that I had a bumper car, so I could just like knock people out of the ways times, but that can just be Road rage, but. it's just been I don't know like they're not violent enough that scares me in such a way. Or that scares anybody because i'm a mom and i'm more of a lover than I am a fighter so whatever it is, I have to be like all the way on the edge, but it would just be like ooh should I jump like what happened if I jump. But i'm too scared to jump I will you can even catch me going close to the edge but i've had like you know thoughts of like endlessly falling. Okay, like. I don't know just closing my eyes and just close my eyes and then just whatever comes from it comes from it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have any thoughts like that now."
16492.0,Patient,Not necessarily okay they're just more so of like not wanting to be here like.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"You know, like, I just wanted to just like disappear."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, and you say you don't have a support you know, there is a hotline. If you're if if things get so heavy because you know life will be like we were going to have our good days we're gonna have our bad days we're going to wake up. we're going to struggle with depression we're going to struggle with angry thoughts we're going to struggle with anxiety or fearful thoughts, so if you have a really low day there is a hotline. Three digits kind of similar to 911 but it's 988. And you can call that number and and get some help like instantly kind of like people call 911 for other types of emergencies."
16492.0,Patient,"Right and that's where a lot of my anxiety also comes from. Okay it's just like constantly fighting it's like it's like having the devil and the angel. You know it's like you have the devil there and he's just like this go away let's go away there's nobody going to miss you, you know but. Because I am me like i'm just like no i'm not going nowhere like where you gonna go i'm special like so it's just like having having those thoughts and like reminding myself that I am worth something. You know okay."
760.0,Provider,"I think that kind of ambivalent feelings of ambivalence in in wanting to get better it's kind of normal we have that side but, but the side of wanting to harm yourself that's that's kind of where."
16492.0,Patient,I could commit suicide now.
760.0,Provider,not going to do that.
16492.0,Patient,Okay that's out. I don't even like like to inflict I can't even I don't even like to inflict harm I don't like to. Remember those one time my brother's ear kind of like closed up he's like sister stick this through i'm like. I just because it's just I don't know I just the fact of me hurting somebody instance like it makes me cringe i'm like I can't do it.
760.0,Provider,And does that include yourself.
16492.0,Patient,Like how people can pierce themselves oh Lord have mercy like you can't even catch me no.
760.0,Provider,"All right, all right, we see him oh health health problems you have any health problems. Physical."
16492.0,Patient,"Problems no not not that i'm a okay that's a lie, so they have told me but hasn't been too concerning yet, because it has it got to the size, but I do have a cyst. Okay that's probably going to kind of like come up in the. Future possibly but there they run their genetically so they they've read in my family my mom just had some issues with hers my grandma had issues with her so it's not nothing scarier than i'm anemic. i've got it okay."
760.0,Provider,"And how do you take care of yourself physically you get the right amount of sleep. No, no."
16492.0,Patient,"right amount of food nope I be having to remind myself, not to starve. But that's not purposely. that's just. Because I just I don't know, I find myself so busy in life, like I either forget or I don't realize that time flew by so much that I didn't eat until like."
760.0,Provider,"Mid days, so you forget to eat."
16492.0,Patient,uh huh.
760.0,Provider,Do you see how many hours.
16492.0,Patient,"Sometimes I have an appetite but don't want to eat, I feel like that's the depression part okay. And then I guess my abuse to my weed."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16492.0,Patient,"So sometimes I get hungry and and i'm like i'm gonna go smoke my blood, so I could get the munchies and then my food to be extra good, but then. It actually suppresses the appetite and such the way, sometimes, and then you like forget to eat like right then and there, like the whole point was to like eat, but then you don't eat until like hours later, so, then that kind of like makes you miss a meal or snacks per per se, you know."
760.0,Provider,Because when we don't eat that kind of have a negative impact on our mental health as well. yep making us feel depressed or anxious yeah how about exercise.
16492.0,Patient,"I need to get into it, I would like to get back into it. Okay, but it's having the time to having the energy to. You know when i'm running around every day. Working 24 seven most of my jobs require me on my feet, so I consider that my exercise on daily you know walking around wandering around but no, I need to I want to."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, well i'm you've been very open, I appreciate your honesty and your openness, you can go far as long as you just you know truthfulness is like really important and. Sharing where you know where you've been what you've been going through, and I know, sometimes these conversations can be hard difficult to talk about, but you know the really the only way to express emotions is to let them out. and talk about them. i'm thinking just just so you know i'm thinking, I would like to you know as long as you think this works for you, I have. for help with anxiety, there is a coping skill called mindfulness it helps slow down a person's thoughts and anxiety, we can work on do some mindfulness work I have some material called seeking safety if that's the name of the program it is for individuals who have struggled with. Either traumatic events, including ptsd and or substance abuse, and I think there's some things in there that might really help you kind of consider talk about that as well. And then kind of maybe some self esteem work and taking a look at the impact of being raised by to alcoholics how that you know because it's a human being, our personality gets set at the age of five. Okay, and so the environment, you know the the environment that were raised in kind of affects us. In addition to some of the physical traits that we inherit from our parents grandparents and such. But those those are you know those things can be worked on it is a process checklist it's not an overnight thing. But you, you have a lot of i'm going to use the word tenacity. And if you apply that same tenacity, that you that you've applied it, you know, raising your son and your and your sister daughter, and everything else, then you have the capacity to go far in healing yourself. So I just that's that's that's a huge strength."

Virtual clinic and and cancel or reschedule don't don't just not show yeah and and, as far as your groups have you started your groups, yet."
