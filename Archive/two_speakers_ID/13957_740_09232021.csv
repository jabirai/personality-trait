13957.0,Patient,"um I can believe regarding about this appointment. But yeah everything's going good. i'm i'm like stressing a little bit. So i'm. i'm. i'm just I don't know I feel just stress so i'm like i'm overeating. So i'm just kind of. and I don't know what it is probably just about everything, like all my problems and stuff so i'm just kind of stressing and then i'm just. Like I like i'll just get really hungry, like my baby you'll like trigger my anxiety to. And then i'll just really eat and I was just like man I would never get like this with my younger with my older kids but with this one I he'll just come, and I will just feel his energy and i'll just like he, like okay great so we're. i'm like oh my gosh i'm like how weird is that. But yeah. So right now i'm just. I woke up morning early and. I went to sleep really late because I go to school, and so I went to sleep really late like almost like at three so I fell asleep. And that's all that I think that's been going on, I don't really know what what's stressing me out like I just. I just besides what what makes me sad I just wouldn't know like I don't know why I feel so like stressed out I feel under a lot of. Pressure I don't know like I feel like i'm under a lot of pressure, but what am I how am I what am I supposed to do, like like I just I I can't see a path like to go on to next you know. i'm like still in the same in the same route that I that i'm in and I just don't know. Like I don't even see like a path to like to go into next you know i'm just like this is my, the only thing I could think of is like I should take my kids out I haven't took them out since like August. I should take them out like like to an amusement park or something because it's already going to be October and i'm like I should take them out, but maybe they feel isolated besides their school, maybe we need to go out and do something as a family. Other than that, I don't i'm not really sure. What it is."
740.0,Provider,"So we have children, we are cool."
13957.0,Patient,"yeah holly. Excuse me, while i'm doing my face cream, at the same time, while I talk to you."
740.0,Provider,Okay yeah somewhere to be.
13957.0,Patient,"No um no not right now till later till like 10 I have to leave to my son school appointment, oh no actually just go drop them off, but but it's okay i'll be fine i'm just. Doing my face my face massaging. While I."
740.0,Provider,So what's your biggest stress like what's the what's the main source of the story.
13957.0,Patient,"So, right now, I feel so relieved like like i'm talking to you i'm doing self care. I just had breakfast and my son's in his room doing his homework he's doing what he's supposed to be doing, and I was reading my magazine, while I was waiting for this appointment. And I just feel I feel relax. I was listening to some music and I swear I don't know why, but my son when he wakes up I just feel strange like suddenly I feel so stiff. And i'm like oh my God, why would like I always tell him what's going on what's bothering you. Like, why do you know and then i'll carry him and then i'll just feel so much pain in my arm and in my neck. And so he'll just trigger all my pain and my like my like pain like it's pain that he triggers and i'm like cool man right like that's what I mean like Why do I feel like this with him. I have never felt like this before with my other kids and i'm like it must be because i'm getting older, I must because i'm getting older and my body can't take this the strain and the anxiety and then i'm a single mom so it's not like I share I don't share. Like. You know his. acute kids care with anybody else it's just me, that is, that is caring for my for him so it's just like, why does I also wonder what it is so. that's what it is i'm trying to figure out why does he feel so strange like Oh, I was trying to think what that picture it's a baby and you're holding his little hand. yeah so I was just. I was just like man why I didn't give me such a heck you know why do you."
740.0,Provider,admire your younger.
13957.0,Patient,"yeah my. he's my little. taller and it's just really happened recently, I was just thinking how weird how how weird is it that you, you call all this anxiety and. Like pain it's pain like i'll just feel like my body's going into shock, you know, I was like, how can we need to work something out and then i'll just start like like in my mind. i'll start getting like new connections like to rethink my mother way of my the way my thought processes it's like so right now just calm i'm in the moment. i'm in the moment i'm enjoying the kitchen, you know the I can feel the soup and the smoothness of me massaging my my face and stuff i'm able to hear you and understand you. But when he when he comes I mean it's not all the time trying to do we need to like with my son, we need to find something that works for us something where. It says we don't have we there's we don't have like like, for we need to be under a like a glass Cape or something so we can be like. Be have no like negative emotions or negative pain, because that's my card I don't know if you know what i'm talking about but that's how I feel with him and i'm just worried, the point here with you, is why did you come at me with this force this huge negative energy. I that's what I need to figure out like I need to an even to sit down and I don't want to go over and. Over then cause him anxiety, so the way I feel I feel like that's how he feels like she feels like strain and like he'll be less so, I feel like that's how he's feeling so i'm just like me to find something to do because. What when i'm watching him and i'm he's so sometimes i'm able to watch him and he's relaxed and he's playing with this game we're both relaxed and then suddenly like my head will just start to like her, and stuff like. That so I need to work on that. Like. give more thought into what might he might be needing."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, what if, if you work from home you stay home or how did that go, how did that work."
13957.0,Patient,No i'm part time so i'm always home with him i'm always home with it. So i'm thinking.
740.0,Provider,is going to the daycare and option.
13957.0,Patient,"yeah he goes to a daycare like I lately i've been working only like twice a week and it's only for like a few hours it's not even that much. And and yeah and i'll i'll just drop him off he kind of crazy a little bit because i'm leaving but not like dramatically but you'll cry and then he'll. he'll. And then, when I pick them up he'll be like you know Mon and you'll want to come with me already like you know, like my mom came to pick me up."
740.0,Provider,"So what about the days that you don't work, you know even an option to at least drop my for half a day if you drop the kids off to drop him off and then pick them up around like 12 or something like that, like, at least for half a day, so it can give you some town of. relaxation, so you can actually do things for yourself. clean up the House cuz some. You know, could be in early you know just to do something for you so. it's possible to drop them off, at least for half a day. We got one."
13957.0,Patient,"What I was thinking like dropping off I used to do this with my other kids like well where we need a break like we need a break. I would drop them off at a child care and then I would just stay home and honestly, I would just like I don't know like cook watching movie. Like do self care and then I just with I just really started thinking with this one, like, I was like I wonder if he's too young to sleep on certainly meet him for that or like i'm always thinking about it, I was like how am I gonna do it."
740.0,Provider,He flew right.
13957.0,Patient,I have to.
740.0,Provider,know if your baby.
13957.0,Patient,"yeah he's like a he's a. Little taller he just he just barely turn to so I know he's probably going through that phase, because my other one he was. My middle child, he also was he had he would throw tantrums and he would he need he would like in publix I couldn't take him to public places anymore, because he would like smack me on like. Oh, so I went through time where I couldn't take him until he was able to behave in public, so this one, luckily is not like that he behaves very well, but here at home um. it's just more like he is my as behavior is actions it's more like the energy that we both feel like like it's really bad negative energy and I can't really say that stresses me out. what's going on, why is. That."
740.0,Provider,What are the negative energy come from you said it's not because he's misbehaving or anything like a you. know.
13957.0,Patient,"Like will go out like will go out like I try to go out like every week i'll take him out like let's go to the. Like to shopping or will go outside and play so you can release you know some of that you know hyper in you know if he wants to go outside just to get fresh air. And it's like it's not enough, but I, you know how kids I was at least my other older kids as to when I would take them to the park day would want to be there all day, but this one, you only want to be there for like a couple of a couple of. minutes and stuff and like like not even like half an hour i'll take him to the park and after half an hour he's done he just wants to come home and i'm like really and i'll still feel like. I want to be out here, and you know I still feel since the will leave and also really like stream but he'll want to call them already and i'm like oh my gosh Oh, let me."
740.0,Provider,"ask you this because, again at the end of the day, you know the child does not run the parent the parent runs the chat. So it's been able to kind of provide their balance and that structure, it seems like. It seems like the stress comes from you feel like you need to meet his every domain, if he wants this, then you got to do it if he needs this thing you got to do it if you don't want to do this, then you won't do it now he's too. yeah and so you know i'm saying the thing about it is, is that you provide you provide a structure in his life. You provide this stability in his life you provide their routine in his life if it's half an hour. If it's half an hour and he wants to come home then try to come up with another activity of the job and move together still outside. You know, for another 30 minutes when I hire someone one more 30 minutes one was entering his come on let's let's do something else. You know i'm saying, and like you know, be more interactive with him so that he can understand you i'm saying the there is a balance. in regards to you know you have to kind of develop this structure keeps me fresh air if I mean hey if they need vitamin D and other kind of stuff. And if you feel like whoa I like being fired, and this is why I get my release and he's ready to come home, then, then he don't when you when you just find different activities to do outside."
13957.0,Patient,"yeah i'm outside and like i'll be like where did he go, he was already inside the House and i'm like oh. My gosh and. I just dropped whatever I was doing, and then I came inside the House, it was just like I was just like I felt at least he felt relieved or why not. But I was still feeling I felt a bit relieved, but not all the way, so i'm just like feeling like okay so we're kind of I see that we're kind of like. Playing like hot potato with this negative energy between me and him and i'm like Ali, we need to like like how you said, we need to find some way to get rid of this negative energy because it's causing us. it's not good for us it's causing us pain, you know discomfort, so we need to get rid of this negative energy, so we can enjoy our day so."
740.0,Provider,So if there's a negative energy comes comes with. him not wanting to do the you want to do or him we're bailing.
13957.0,Patient,"yeah it's like the same sometimes I won't want to do the things he wants to do, and sometimes he doesn't want. To like lay there and we'll watch watching TV, but then he loses his patient and then he will like start to kick me and i'm like oh my God i'm like this is why i'm like i'm leaving i'm here early so i'll let him. play on watch the TV while i'm here watching him from my kitchen and the living rooms just right here, and I could see what they're doing. Now i'm leaving i'm out here, so our attention span is very small and i'm just like oh my God so it's just we're just going through it we're going through that phase. I don't I think it's because he's in his terrible twos I think has to do something with that, because my middle child like I said he went through it, too, but. This one with this one it's a little bit worse than the middle child, so I know I mix everything that has happened i'm expecting I had expected it, but not to be. like this bad like oh my gosh like he's told us a little worse, but I lazy X behaves well in public like, but here at the House he'll like feel like. Oh man you'll climb everything I know like just be so destructive."
740.0,Provider,"But I mean yeah. I mean, of course, because he's a toddler and coming into their college. Everything and they do everything. And so maybe maybe you should try to pick up at option to see if they're if they cared willing to take him on the day because you don't have to go to work early for half a day."
13957.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was thinking, I might need to. work a little bit more, and maybe."
740.0,Provider,Yes.
13957.0,Patient,Skills and stuff.
740.0,Provider,"So we can interact with other kids he can play with other toys, you know i'm saying he's able to have some kind of social skills. And he you know, after a while he gets more than that how a mom where he wants to do stuff you know he wants to interact he wants to play things he wants to knock down blocks and legos and play with trucks and. And stuff of that nature and then to play with other children, and so you never know how he may interact, you know with other children until you put him in that environment and only going once and twice a week. There may not be enough, you know it may be more so, being able to be him being able to be interactive with them, maybe at least four times a week or something like that."
13957.0,Patient,Or at least more hours within the day i'm thinking like. i'm he's only there for like three hours to the most I want to see and.
740.0,Provider,I know you might.
13957.0,Patient,"Really me. some kind of conversation or interaction with the kids and find his self identity like so i'm kind of you know i'm just there with that one that that's like one of my main. Stress triggers right now going through that phase with my is my son. So So then, as far as a relationship like I don't i'm not in one my I think about my my my kid's dad a lot. But not like to get back with him. But it's more like a I was thinking it's more like a. look like."
740.0,Provider,This he that help.
13957.0,Patient,yeah he actually does pay for child support. But I just feel like I feel I don't feel like the nah man I.
740.0,Provider,feel his shoes and I take him for a wiki. And you're.
13957.0,Patient,"able to do that he's not able to do that so right now. he's not really he doesn't trigger my anxiety or anything like that I feel at peace and then my kids are at peace also they kind of have an understanding of where their dad is like where he stands so they understand why they're not able to see the dad so i'm just like okay so. So I don't and then like I just got out of a relationship like months ago. Because I just I just felt overwhelmed so it was like I had no time like to be in a relationship because, like I said, my son. My son was just really occupied he doesn't really let me do anything like I just i'm barely having yesterday I fell asleep at three in the morning I didn't even put on my cream, so I had to put them on this morning. And so, this is why i'm putting these on late because I had to leave those creams on at least a couple of hours. And so I just barely putting my new set of creams like like at this time i'm just like and I was just like cuz his his bedtime he doesn't have a set bedtime and i'm just you know i'm just. I yeah I guess I do feel a bit guilty like I should try to find time I put him to bed, I actually went and I put him to bed yesterday and then. I left him in there, my room he didn't he woke up at a decent time, but he didn't go to sleep either like till really late like. Basically, the same time, I did so with the bed time we're kind of struggling i'm thinking of just letting him sleep for like an hour or two and then having to wake him up. So he doesn't sleep, so he can sleep through the night so but I just cut wasn't sure if that was a safe, you know. thing to do with him like should I wake him up, but I think it's okay to wake them up after seven hours like you know when they're in preschool you have to wake them up. So I feel like it would be okay to wake him up like after like two hours when he takes a nap because he'll nap and you'll probably not for like five hours um I don't think that's a good thing, so I might need to change my routine or the way I have him take NAPs."
740.0,Provider,hmm yeah that's true.
13957.0,Patient,So we'll try that.
740.0,Provider,"So it's kind of like basically just kind of altering, we need to alter something. And how you do things and kind of putting him on a different type of schedule."
13957.0,Patient,"yeah I think that would really, really help if I could. Stick to his. To his napping but sometimes it's also like I feel strain like to wake him up i'll feel like I can't wake them up, I have like I was just feel awfully bad, but I need to make know in my mind like no, because if you don't wake come up it's going to be worst I need to. know my foot down and wake him up so he can be up on, you know, in the day and then have a normal sleep and then I can also. get into my my route back to my routine because it's also I think that's also causing me stress the fact that i'm sleeping really, really late. doing everything and i'm only getting a couple of hours and i'll be so sleepy during the day during the day i'll be like like smoothing like i'll be doing my homework, I saw i've hit my head like twice. On my computer like i'll be on my tablet and or on my computer whatever and i'll just be like i'm like oh my God. So yeah."
740.0,Provider,you're tired you're tired.
13957.0,Patient,"yeah so that needs to change, I think that's i'm gonna i'm seeing now talking to you, you know and i'm starting my thoughts What can it be and i'm like yeah I think the napping is one one thing. And that's probably if I could, because I, I tried it one day like I did everything and I, we were in bed before 10 and i'm like yay this help, but then the next day I try it again and I felt like push to later later and I swear I got hungry. And i'm like man. I was like but that other day, where I did everything right I my hunger, I swear I didn't feel hungry, I went to sleep and I did not wake up with hunger and I was like I was like this is probably the answer to why i'm feeling stress hungry and tired all the time because of my routine. I need to put my."
740.0,Provider,"And I mean that's how that's how it works, I mean the thing about it is, is there. You know it's crazy because of the fact that you know he's only two but he's running he's running us right. and yeah, and so it just it just one of those things like I said when you when you figure out what doesn't work, and that means okay well, let me reconstruct it let's go back to the drawing board. Let me figure out what I can do thought so this can work, because the thing about it is, is that you're saying it's not really is not really negative energy what it is, is that you just stress that. You just straight and you're overwhelmed that's how it is and yeah those those these can be negative. And that's what that's where that comes from you i'm saying and the thing about it is, is because of the fact that you're stressed out. And that you remember that you're overwhelmed you know, to the point where it's kind of like where does that ability wild like knowledge and be like that it shouldn't be like that is being able to. find a new routine that he can actually. That you can actually start implementing in his life so he can understand, like okay stroke in even with children structures, what they need, they need is important and, like a daycare he gets this structure and then at home. He only knows that he can do whatever you want to do. But, of course, I rather stay home going to go to daycare with a baker give me structure, how God instruction, but if you can implement the same structure that he gets in daycare. Then i'm sure, things will be able to transition and turn around and be fixed. Because I know for fact daycares only key, it is not a rat all day. yeah they got learned in time in naptime and lunchtime in record time and resources and other kind of stuff and so you know if being able to have those blocks, you know, being able to implement those blocks, even when he's not. In daycare that you can implement those things, so he could say on the instruction time. But i'm going to show you something real fast from stress management tips."
13957.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"um so i'm going to go over some of these with you. And it talks about stress management tips, the first thing you say this keep in mind is stress isn't a bad thing. It says that stress. motivates us to work towards solving our problems. reframing thoughts to view straight is an acceptable option or every tool has been found to reduce many of the negative symptoms associated with it. The goal is to manage stress not so eliminated. Right. keep in mind. Stress isn't a bad thing. It motivates us to work hard towards solving the problem."
13957.0,Patient,and To keep motivated to speed things up. Because then you're gonna be all sloan arrogant nothing.
740.0,Provider,"Right and so, if we're framing view stress as an acceptable emotion. or as a tool has been found to reduce meaning negative symptoms, so you reframe how you look at stress as a way to motivate you to solve the problems and understand the stress is an acceptable emotion, they you can reduce the negative energy that you feel. Right, it says, the goal is to manage the stress natural eliminated, because the stress pushes you to be productive the stress pushes you to be able to bow whatever it is stressing you out does that make sense. yeah Okay, so the next one says talk about your problems, even if they won't be solved. Talking about your stressors even if you don't solve them releases hormones and your body they reduce the. negative feelings associated with strips. tabs man talking with friends and loved ones is valuable, even when you have a lot on your plate, so this window right now we're talking about it yeah. next thing is prioritize your responsibility, focused on completing. Tasks first. having too many to do, can be stressful even if none of them are very be quickly knocking out the small tasks will clear up your mind to focus on larger responsibility. Okay. So when it says prioritize you know anything about any of my net all in business to your own needs structure, but the mommy structure to. yeah right and being."
13957.0,Patient,yeah they'll they'll pick up on your habits like. yeah I noticed. Like she'll just start imitating me like I like I have nothing to say because i'm the same way.
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely and you're right. You are their first. Oh, Lord Can you see me I think my baby okay. But you are the first example, you are the example that they see right, and so they are patterned after your emotions little pattern after your lifestyle they're even even say what you say."
13957.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"that's how they pick up language they pick up language, based on what they hear you thing. But you will I last. night and they can, and they can also be annoying but at the same time they're learning. And so they're picking up on they're picking up language and they're picking on how to say things. And you know i'm saying their first teacher issues before you say do chapter, they can you teach them everything for based on it, regardless, if you have, if you take them out of a personally or you see some out of your behaviors that you do every day. You think Sam base I watch I watch on TV. You think them based on how you behave or how or even how how you communicate on the phone with somebody in here. Right, so you teach him a lot sometimes you can teach him without teaching him. What I intentionally teaching him, you see a teacher them because he's been an impressionable stage to where now he picked up on everything. That you do everything that you say and things of that nature, so when it says are always has new responsibility you're saying a lot of times you know it's good for you to have this structure is we're in a downtime and to be able to relate first, you have to be able to identify what. What you're to do what your list of to do's are and then like if they're taking it from the smaller tasks to the bigger task and not going to that. The next. The next thing focus on the basics is stressed and fought a harmful cycle we're basic were basic needs are neglecting which leads to more strength major points of focus on your basic needs, such as eating way of keeping a healthy sleep schedule you already said you don't sleep do. exercise and and other forms of self care like you say you said here. You i'm saying you know you're putting your cream on your face and go over that's good in regards to self care, however. A healthy sleep schedule and eating well contributes to that to being less stressful I mean if you me if you eat fast food and eating case studies and and all that kind of stuff on it, you kind of eat out every day because. Greece and even fattening things and stuff like that. you're thinking about is what you see Joe sales, I mean what you see junkie is you can feed yourself man, they want to eat junkie and eat sandwiches and article would choose that article talking about a concept Okay, you know, the thing about these is that you have to be you have to be. focused on your own we'll just in your own here so that you can visit examples to them does that make sense. So focus on the basic. Eating wheel. Keeping a healthy sleep schedule, you need to stop sleeping more. You know, eight hours. Even peak they say they said, the average number is six to eight. Right So even if you get six is good. But you so much again for me. yeah the average for an adult is at least six hours."
13957.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"All right, so we need. yeah, we need to strive for it, we need to shop for it so here's here's another one that's a good one don't put all your eggs in one basket. People who are over involved in one aspect of their life often struggle to deal with stress when when that area is threatened. Balance your time and energy between several areas such as your career your family's friendship and personal hobbies if you put all your energy and sustained into your son. Then you're going to be you're going to be overwhelmed you're going to meet because right now you're overly involved, which is a bit the individual mommy but at the same time you don't have balance and other areas. there's anything."
13957.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So satellite. So it is more for like hey me my son and my son and me and me and the boy, and the boy and me, and what of licenses of me and the boy, and the boy and me and the bandwidth is that you know i'm saying is not. You know you're, it has to be, it has to be a balance, it says balance your time your energy between several different areas. So you work part time okay so there's some you know this nonsense, so that means we say we're going to pick up more hours, so that way he can have one time and day care. Alright, so that's the balance you i'm saying in some areas, because you do have older children. You know i'm saying allow them to help you out as well in regards to making sure they do their chores and things of that nature and hip and now when you're younger you don't send that out of balance so they will you know, do something for yourself by yourself. You know. After he taking yourself out to get your nails done or your feet done and taking your ass to get a massage or you know engaging in a personal hobbies that you always wanted to do. Do those things, because the thing about it is, is that the it we're trying to run away from negative negative energy, but there is no negative energy they're just they're just they're just not enough productivity. right and it think about your stress and you're overwhelmed you i'm saying, and so you Betsy was negative because it affects that you're not getting the relaxation that you actually desire. You i'm saying, putting face cream or your face is one thing, but actually taken out of time away from your environment away from your. Your your art your daily obligation and just kind of taking our time hire you babysitter or get a family member to come over to watch the key is for a little bit why you go at I mean it's okay to take that time for yourself. Because the health is important. You are only is due to your children as as much as you, you only have this your children. As much as you can see yourself, so if you're not if you're not going to be any good to hear and that's the reason why you stressed that and that's reason why you feel like is negative energy flowing around no negative energy you distress that. you're overwhelmed.

740.0,Provider,"yeah I want to know if it works. And the thing about it is it's a trial and error so some things may work some things you may have to tweak. You know, in so it's one of those things to where you know it's you don't really know what works until you try it. But you have to try to leave at least more than one down to like all I tried it once manager and it didn't work, so we can kind of build it away and it just because i'll have his diehard, but they do that. And so now because think about it as he's he's already he's already develop the habit of his own. yeah so that means you're about to come in and you about the changing. So it's going to take a little time, you know it's going to take a little time for him to get acclimated today, and so we have to see how if you're really works or if it's really effective so give yourself some time with it practice it and then kind of let me know i'm eager to see.

Also, like spending a little bit of time yeah so I feel well balanced, as far as that goes i'm gonna i'm gonna try to just work on the routine and. and get more. discipline in the in the kids and within myself, and that should help that should really help I just need to put my foot down and do it not. procrastinate on things that. are going to eliminate tasks that don't I could that I could wait for like on the weekend, or something so i'm I should do stuff like that."
