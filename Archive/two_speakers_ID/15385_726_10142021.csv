726.0,Provider,So. Yes. hi.
15385.0,Patient,Hello.
726.0,Provider,How are you.
15385.0,Patient,"Doing i'm doing i'm doing well today, thank you."
726.0,Provider,well. A little bit of what brought you to pray at her house.
15385.0,Patient,"What brought me to raise her health that is honey i'm a very sudden episode. that's like. A kind of like a manic episode. This is my first time ever in, then I was under the influence of marijuana so I don't know if that has something to do with it. So it was um and then I also experienced it experienced a lot of paranoia during that time. Which costs for me to get hospitalized."
726.0,Provider,was a paranoia when you were using marijuana and he has this manic episode.
15385.0,Patient,"Yes, so usually I was smoking marijuana, why was, I had a vapor pen that I used to smoke at night, to be able to go to sleep. Okay, something. That i've been doing, I want to say, for a good a good year. Maybe year and a half, because I have always had horrible insomnia. And finally. When I tried on the wreck somebody recommended for me to small part one of that it helps them sleep, so I said i'll give it a try and it really did work. I was able to go to sleep pretty well until that particular night I I. what's it called I use my Bay pen it was like this new new one that I had a hard indigo and I want to hand smoke did and I figured i'm going to go to sleep. But I didn't I had a lot of racing thoughts hey. yeah I mean I know it because I usually would smoke weed to go to sleep, it makes me sleepy so I went ahead and i'm like Okay, let me take another plus."
726.0,Provider,And I went ahead and took another plus.
15385.0,Patient,"And I slept about two hours, and then the next day I woke up and I was just on what to call myself."
726.0,Provider,"OK OK, now the marijuana was it from a dispensary that you bought it or somebody that play that usually buy from or something."
15385.0,Patient,"So they have I usually get it delivered, so it is kind of like a dispensary something called power supply so it's a well known place so. yeah I figured i've been buying my stuff from there for for a while. So. I this particular one, I decided to try a new one, but I always kind of do you know this site different flavors but it's usually indigo that helps people to sleep so. And I only use that one at night and there's times, where I used to use the hybrid because the indycar really pushed me down. yeah this particular one I had already bought. So it was my first time kind of use. That one."
726.0,Provider,"So tell me a little bit about. I know what it sounds like this was a first time that's ever happened to you. Have you ever had any other like depression or like diagnoses of mental health in the past, before or gone to therapy or done any of that."
15385.0,Patient,"yeah so this particular year of the pandemic dead of last year was pretty hard on hard on me, I was dealing with a lot of stressors my whole family end up getting covert I go for it. I was asymptomatic my son was a symptom my my husband was had my old mostly asymptomatic and my mother in law. She got really sick really sick what she had to go to had to get hospitalized. So that was very stressful for us so during that time. I just kind of felt like I had to be taken care of people, and although I also had it it almost felt like. I just had to take care of my my father in law take care of my son being worried that I really thought my mother in law was practically the she was really severe that I might die, so it was on. It was really hard on me and beginning of this of this year I was experiencing depression, so I. decided to get myself into therapy and I went ahead and got myself into therapy, but I want to say it was like three months, where the depression was pretty pretty. pretty bad in the sense that I couldn't really escape it I think before the pandemic there's just a lot of on. what's a cold. distract distractions. Where I will say track my soul with work distract my soul with with different things, and for the first time it's like I couldn't do that. I was working from home my son was I was home pretty much homeschooling him because nobody was allowed to go to schools, so it just felt like I didn't have any sort of escape. And it really took a toll on me and I was experiencing a lot of depression, I want to say, for a good three months, where I just had a lot of crying. spells I couldn't I couldn't hide from it."
726.0,Provider,"And what ways. Were you able to distract it before, and how are you feeling with the depression now."
15385.0,Patient,"I know I feel well actually right um I want to say when I had that depression, it was for a few months and I started to really have. what's it called done really focus on my leg recovery and my kind of in a way, what I would describe my own mental health journey, even when my spirituality I. I had moments, where I felt like I sort of like surrendered myself. A lot of it had to do with. sort of my my ego the shirts, this is the way things should be i'm. Also i'm also a therapist. So this was really when I was experiencing depression and it didn't make sense, because i'm like i'm a therapist. Oh yeah so I had a hard time with that and it just came to like part of like this virtuality I sort of I would describe myself as surrendering and just allowing myself to just be human and experiencing the range of emotions that I have. And when I did that and I, along with getting therapy and all that I felt like I was in a really good place so with this episode honestly came out of nowhere like it just it felt like it came out of nowhere. In a lot of it during the episode, it was a lot of on what's it called. Like it just completely like a sense of paranoia where I felt like I couldn't trust my family I couldn't even I haven't really, really close coworker that we are super we're super close during that episode it's just felt like I couldn't I couldn't trust anyone, it was really scary. It was really, really scary and I think that's why the paranoia happen. But maybe it has something to do with the reaction or my family had, I do think it has something to do with it. Because I woke up I woke up that day that particular day and I just remember on I was telling them like I feel like. God is in our presence like just feeling like God was in our presence and my husband was like What do you mean goddess in our personal like I don't know I just feel like god's with us right now, like, I feel I feel his presence. for whatever reason. Now, given I was pretty erratic and I was also a little Maliki so my husband got really scared and he ended up on colleague in my mother in law. And all of their family and they're like a very they're very close family, which is very different from my own family, like my mom has always allowed me to have my own independence. And for me to be sort of separate."
726.0,Provider,From.
15385.0,Patient,"My family like i'm able to be with my family, but then I always felt like i'm also able to be alone in my family is not going to shame me or make me feel bad about that. Then I mom so when. Now the family of my husband is very different they're very they're very close to the point that it could be a bit much being quite honest it's it's. Yes, definitely that's how I would describe it, so when I had that episode and I saw my mother in law automatically I felt like sort of betrayed by my husband like Why would you call her."
726.0,Provider,Like she's not going to be able to understand this and you know she's not gonna be able to understand this.
15385.0,Patient,"I was also paranoid, so I told him that and then after that it was just to complete I remember bits and pieces of it, but I just remember. Like it felt like my my my brother in law he's religious so he's kind of like on he's like a Catholic. very much. When I was telling him I just feel God in her presence it's not in particular to a religion like i'm just telling you like I just feel him. So then he. He I don't know like it felt like they were they were trying they thought like I have like a like a demon inside of me or something. So. Anything that's what brought up the even more paranoia."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, when you felt the presence of God did it feel comforted or did it feel. Like scary to you."
15385.0,Patient,"it's so comforting at the beginning, when I woke up it's still really comforting and it just It made me, it was a sense of like just me being happy like It made me feel calm, but then, when my my my in laws came it almost started to feel like scary it started to. feel like. This is our right like what's what's like it almost felt like they thought that I was kind of going crazy. So I. When I started to have that suspicion It made me super paranoid and then made me wanting them to leave and they almost. I think, without them in unintentionally they don't know about this that much they almost done wanted for me to. I don't know what they really want me to do, but it almost felt like they were trying to like I remember it was I don't remember all bits and pieces i've been being quite honest with you but. It just felt like I was like fighting like I was like literally fighting. For me to just. Get. Get out of that experience um because it was really scary and I just. Remember, even my my brother I don't know who it was. I mean, I had a lot of energy, during that time, like I don't even know how I had that much energy. But I was literally fighting them like it was like three people pinned me down because I was literally fighting them. Like trying to meet."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
15385.0,Patient,um they didn't want they were scared because no one will get hospitalized they were like we don't know what this is we don't know there's something spiritual we don't know if it's a mental health related. So they were kind of like. They didn't know what to do. But I just think that the approach that they took if they would have taken a more gentle approach. Maybe I wouldn't have had that big of a reaction.
726.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like you were enough vulnerable state, so it so if someone brings in other people from the outside, is your husband. She it sounds like he didn't know what to do so, he closed the first person that he probably thought of as oh I don't know what to do, maybe my bottle know or you know. So I wonder is. I mean, it could be i'm just trying i'm like. analyzing everything right, and so, so it sounds like one, it could be, you know, whenever you used to go to sleep. But I have heard of people get off using them long in having that cause like a panic attack at some point or like a reaction so it could be a lot of different things, but. Well, I think what's most important is you know for yourself what this is breaking up for you now, because you had that experience and. How does it feel like now, when you're thinking about your relationships with your husband and his family and and how the reactions were."
15385.0,Patient,"So up during. It took what I was hospitalized it took me a while for me to be even able to trust the staff at the hospital because it just felt like. I couldn't trust anyone, because at this point I couldn't trust my family and and I was like I was just very scared so it took me me trusting the staff and realizing they're really nice people that are just kind of here wanting to help and also I work at a site word before. So I kind of know a lot of mental health professionals and just the way they talk about clients and patients and how they can be very um you know just not empathetic and compassionate."
726.0,Provider,and definitely be yeah.
15385.0,Patient,"yeah so having had that experience I automatically kind of thought don't tell me that this is kind of be is going to be my experience, but I said to myself, you know. there's a reason why i'm here and there's a reason why all of this happened to me, so let me just go ahead and you know start being open to this so once I started kind of being open to them, it started making me trust them and then, as a result, I also my husband would be calling me and. My mother in law wouldn't be calling me. And my friend, one of my close friends that I also had a lot of paranoia towards her, she was calling me as well, so little by little, I started to kind of like regain that trust. Initially, when I came back into hospital, I was sort of on kind of a not scared but apprehensive about the family. But I came to realize that. They didn't know any better like it's almost like they didn't know any better, this is. This This is like. This is what they think was good for me, because this is what they do now. Although this is what they do that's not what works for me so that's. A conversation that I had to have I had a conversation with my brother in law. he's very he was very open about it, and he was he was able to understand that now my mother in law is she has difficulty with it, she has to have trouble with it. But um I told I. pretty much told her that. I need my space. Like I need my space sometimes and. it's too much sometimes we're there to to win ball it's. yeah feels like. what's it called like their interest, like something like they're interfering with my my freedom. It feels that way, sometimes but. The show love it's. In this life I."
726.0,Provider,wanna.
15385.0,Patient,"I don't know, I wonder if they get I don't know like I could just imagine, this is the way my my mother in law brought them up to be very close to always be together to always be united. In here that's not what's happening. she thinks there's something wrong."
726.0,Provider,"Oh yeah. yeah and my only to the other thing is, I can imagine if you're doing therapy throughout completed as well, and then you're you're providing a lot of space for people to talk to you be. happy that intensity of them be home be with your family, and I think it it all collided with each other, the amount of of togetherness because i'm sure that at the end of the day, you probably needed more of your space. Yes, yeah."
15385.0,Patient,"I definitely did that in my space, and I think for a while, because of what has happened, like towards the end of last year, with my mother in law, almost dying that. yeah it kind of made me. My my my my husband loves to have like the family over like a lot about. Like it's too much for me and I. yeah at the beginning, when when everything happened with my mother in law, I kind of had like a sense of like. I don't know what it will be like I felt like a sense of responsibility, or even kind of guilt to just have her and play with my husband inviting them over even though sometimes you invite them over without even asking me but. that's the way my husband was brought up he thinks that he shouldn't have to ask about family because it's family and for me it's like. No, you have to ask because, for me, even with my family like I like that my mom asked me hey can I come over hey can I do this like that we have you know some boundaries and with them is like there's no. And boundaries are seem to be like a form of like rejection. For them, but it's not the case, for me, so that is something that we are still trying to navigate. Now they learn like I do need my independence, I think this this episode."
726.0,Provider,yeah I.
15385.0,Patient,kind of realized that that I need my I need my alone time and so we're kind of in that space where they're starting to be a little bit more open the challenge the biggest challenge is my mother in law being quite honest.
726.0,Provider,"yeah. i'm sure she's pretty set on her ways because whatever she's doing she feels like it's working like this is how it's supposed to be. Yes, with your husband, what does he do for work."
15385.0,Patient,"So before he was working as a manager, but he ended up getting a getting them getting fired so right now he's basically getting unemployment and he started his own little he started his business with one of his cousins. Where they're selling selling food. So he's been doing that Fridays Saturdays and Sundays. So plenty to buy like a food truck to kind of expanded. Oh so that's kind of what he's trying to do right now."
726.0,Provider,"The reason I asked to it's because I think sometimes when when you're if your partner doesn't doesn't do the work that you do I don't think they understand the amount of energy, it takes for you to kind of work that you do and then also have to provide that. That attention that energy towards the family as well um cuz if, like let's say he's he's inviting the family over but he's not asking you beforehand, you might have had a long day and then he's not realizing that oh like she's really tired like I don't. Know having to entertain other people once you've already done, the work that you do could be. washing away."
15385.0,Patient,"yeah it really does, and he has a hard time understanding that and maybe also it's been my part where I have then been as vocal about it, especially at the beginning, because I think that I felt that guilt, like in regards to the mom, especially if. You haven't gone. Through and, yes, during those times, it was like they were they were here every weekend and. I just remember I sort of lost during those times like I got lost in the things that I wanted to do I don't know if that might have contributed to my depression being quite honest with you. Because I did you're like yeah like it's all sort of like my life was in. My life wasn't what I wanted to be I wasn't doing the things that I wanted to do it's almost like I was doing the things that they wanted me to do."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. well. Because. it's not be able to have time for yourself it's like not being able to have a quiet time for yourself, so you know how you were talking about like not being able to do the things that you wanted after a while you're. it's almost like something has to happen in order for that to release it so and I wonder if if that panic attack and that paranoia was accumulating over time and then all of a sudden just hit like a ton of breaks down warning."
15385.0,Patient,"mm hmm I do wonder if it was a because I I was. What what even triggered like a lot of the paranoia was them them coming in and just feeling cheer you are again interfering with this. And yes, i'm having this whatever the experience was that I was happy I just think that it would have been better if my husband would have just handle it on his own. And would have like probably. or to have my input and it definitely having my input, he did when he called my mother in law, he didn't even tell me. So, suddenly, she was there, and for me that automatically was like here, here we go again, you cannot whatever reason, my my my husband being quite honest with you. he's a mama's boy he really is like he's so like and it's it's something that, little by little he's been working on um but he always has that sense of like. does need to take care of that the family, this needs to him he's also the oldest one he's the oldest."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
15385.0,Patient,"He kind of took on a father role being quite honest with you because his father was an alcoholic. So he took on the role of kind of being the one to take care of his younger siblings so they usually tend to look at him as far as like. What are we going to do this weekend, are we going to hang down what are we should we go somewhere it's always kind of falls in my husband and as a result, it falls on me."
726.0,Provider,As.
15385.0,Patient,"Well, because yeah in my so it's it's just their dynamics on. It just doesn't work it doesn't work, for me it really does it and i've been very honest with my husband about that, when I had my episode, I told him like I can no longer. I can no longer be doing what I was doing and I need my I need my space, I need boundaries, I need your family to not you know just come unexpectedly I need you to tell me when they're going to be coming over. So I need all these. changes, and it was. It was pretty uh what's it called on. What to call it was pretty hard on him I remember him telling me like whoa. slow down like let me do this, little by little lake and I think it's because he's kind of scared of the reaction that he's going to have with especially his mom."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15385.0,Patient,"yeah so, but at the same time is now i'm realizing like. You have to be able to do your stuff like you need to address these things I don't know if you see anything wrong, which I think he does now there's a lot of other issues going on with my husband. he's really he's starting to realize it and he's he's sort of in that phase where he's wanting to get help but it's at the same time kind of scared."
726.0,Provider,"yeah help in one sense of. your husband, when you say that he's setting like he wants house and away, but is scared to is, it is in terms of the stuff that's going on with his family. or. Just him itself."
15385.0,Patient,It himself is allows himself I know i'm my husband he's a army veteran so. A lot of. He is he did infantry so he went to war in Iraq. He has a lot of ptsd. he's tried getting help through the va. In the past um.
726.0,Provider,"Well, I can't."
15385.0,Patient,"Oh sorry. Sorry, it was a call that I got but yeah he. He tried any help through the va numerous times and I think every time it comes down to him about his trauma is to triggering for him."
726.0,Provider,"That he wants. Oh, I see."
15385.0,Patient,"Another way that my husband has kind of cope with the ptsd has been by him drinking, so he will go on like a bench of like a day of him drinking and then they will be sometimes. He would drink too much and as a result, he just makes them very, very stupid decisions being quite honest with you so first you'll drink and in the army, he used to do this, where he would, and it was the culture there to drink and then they will use coke."
726.0,Provider,and
15385.0,Patient,"So that has been something that my husband on and off has been struggling with i've been with him for 10 years so. The last time that he she did that was. It was it. Was it end of last it was like probably a year and a half ago, and then, very recently, he did it again, a few days ago which kind of triggered a lot of. Feelings for me and and just me telling him like I can no longer do this, I cannot, I can no longer make excuses for you, because I think you should be a world feel sort of like empathy for him for what he's going through. But at the same time it's like. They look what I found through like I have to put myself first and i'm at the point where i'm not i'm telling him. He needs to get the help, but he needs to do it on his own. And if that's not done then. I don't I honestly do not see our relationship working out I don't."
726.0,Provider,"I wonder if cuz I i've worked with veterans, for he would be open to. Our. sentences. Long name but it's very, very effective towards God mama, especially for veterans it's really."
15385.0,Patient,"Good for them he's right now looking into a place in Costa Mesa where they do a lot about them. They have a lot of sort of therapies and it's very holistic place. i'm hopeful, you know that he's gonna actually follow through. And at the same time i'm also in the place where if he does not follow through with it. i'm also going to be okay. Like i'm going to be okay, because now, I know that. This is his process. This is my process and. And maybe you know what it means to we can be together, and although it's hard to think about that i'm also in a place where. It can be okay."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
15385.0,Patient,"yeah. Because this has been going on for throughout our relationship and i've always told him that he needs to get help and yeah he tries. And there's some level of we were sort of angry towards him where i'm like I, I can only imagine you know what he's really, really gone through in what he's actually fighting. But just this hospitalization like made me realize like I was hospitalized, for I don't know how many days i'm completely. Just sort of. Like I need to take care of me I really just need to take care of me and take care of my son. He needs he needs to get the help on his own. I can continue enabling him because I think in a way, I have been enabling him by making excuses for him. And I came to that anymore like now it's time for me to. put myself first and. yeah just put myself first and it's hard you know but. i'm in that place with him right now i'm hopeful that he is going to get help I really am I really wanted to. But I know the pattern that we had in the past and it's like. I think this the years that kind of has made me a little bit loose a little bit of hope. But. You know there's still that. glimpse of hope but. i'm also kind of like preparing myself just the case it's not what I wanted to."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. I think the kindest thing that you could do to somebody is especially in addiction is setting limits with them, because that they will not respond. And will not take the severity of what's going on until someone says this this, you have to get help and it I think you're right it's his choice. And it's going to be. that's going to do it. And you know it could be that he would go to treatment and things kind of work out and everything gets does get better um, but I think it's it's it's healthy to also have that in the back of your mind that if it doesn't work out that you how how you can prepare for that too. yeah that's healthy."
15385.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm in that place right now, where i'm hopeful and at the same time I am preparing myself, just in case it doesn't turn out to be the way that I wanted to be. So it's like i'm experiencing both. And I think that's Okay, you know for me to be able to experience them both."
726.0,Provider,"And I know you're also like a caregiver to them it's almost like you're taking care. in different ways, your husband your kid the family and and also the what happened to your brother in law it's just layer upon layer On top of that you're also there is providing. You know, space for other people is that all those things at the same time is like a storm waiting to happen, because you haven't been able to take time for yourself and you're used to having that space with your own family, so it is really hard. So you know thinking about like. You know you don't have to make any set decisions, right now, nothing is set in stone, but just kind of starting to think about like. Like how How would you like to see yourself live your life six months from now, a year from now, how would you like to feel three months from now, six months from now that's different from where you're at now. like having a vision of what that would look like, for you um you know, including the options of one husband or without husband to because those will look different right."
15385.0,Patient,"yeah they would and one of the things i'm i've had that i've been doing right now is like a lot of like self care like I have my. Usually listen to my podcast go out for walks I was not doing that, during the times that the the family was here alive i'm also enrolling myself in classes, you know because that's another aspect that I really, really love. Just being able to learn. And i'm rolling myself in some classes, that I that I really enjoy and that are really interesting for me and i'm just pretty much telling my husband like hey, this is what i'm doing this is going to be my time. And you need to be okay with that."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
15385.0,Patient,"Like telling you okay with this and I won't be available during those times you know you can my my mother in law like she's little by little story to kind of. The she is very set in her ways like super set of her ways they like it's like probably she's the person that she's a person that I probably haven't met someone, that is, that set in their ways being quite honest with you she's very old fashioned very old school. yeah but now it's like I even think this in a weird way by episode kind of like shifted things for the family in a weird way it happened."
726.0,Provider,So yeah.
15385.0,Patient,"my brother in law is is also kind of like in a way, calling her out and a lot of things. yeah she's starting to little by little. Is she still fighting it, because she's gonna want to resist. But she's kind of yeah before us you'll attack and just talk back and just now she's kind of like staying a little quiet, with just like oh wow like she's not. That quiet like she will she goes in and then she and. We kind of Nice in a weird way that it's it's that's what this episode has done, you know for the family. yeah yeah."
726.0,Provider,"yeah but you know you have you have a lot of stuff going on at the same time, you know, so you know it's weird to it's like. Some people with sleep, for example, right. When you're when you have a lot going on in your mind and there's things that you're afraid, or you have anxieties or worries it's almost like your body like when you're sleeping is completely relaxed right. mm hmm and and let's say you know you have a lot of pent up fears or anxieties that are coming up. it's almost like and this happens, I think, with a lot of people with ptsd too is like your body freaks out when it when it's that common relax because it's not used to that it's like you wake up and it's your heart's racing. So I i'm almost wondering, too, and this, I know you talked about spirituality and I don't know how you feel about this, but I wonder, too, is. kind of part of the feeling of the fear or panic it's like because you've sleep in the same bed let's say with your husband, I wonder if there was any any energy that you absorb from him. There may have been years or may not have been yours for because you're together so closely that you take it in a lot of his stuff not knowing that that's what you were doing."
15385.0,Patient,"I don't think so that's something that i've had that I sat down at on thought several times and even discuss discuss it with my close coworker I do think it started, because it almost felt like it felt literally like an energy taken over me. And it was.
