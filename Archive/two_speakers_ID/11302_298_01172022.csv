298.0,Provider,"Good morning, America, how are you."
11302.0,Patient,I am not doing well.
298.0,Provider,Tell me more.
11302.0,Patient,I had a panic attack about. I would say the beginning of January. haha um. and my grandmother came over for the holidays and I had a discussion with her about like my mom and. Just seeing. What she's told me and what my dad has told me I. I think that I might have been PD also along with my mom because and i've checked the DSM five and I check off pretty much everything on there. and i'm really struggling right now and. I don't know what to do.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so with the PT. And PTT as a diagnosis that takes a little bit of time to get. And what makes you think what is what is it what are the characteristics that you feel like you have."
11302.0,Patient,"um. I. feel like i'm going to be abandoned by friends family. Usually with friends, I feel more. Like if they don't text me right away like I feel like they died or something happened to them. I want to spend all my time with them, if possible, and. I. attach pretty easily to everyone. I. have noticed that i'm attracted to potentially abusive partners. I remember being in. A mental health institution. Five years ago and. This one kid had schizophrenia, and like I was like immediately drawn to him. and i've never I always feel like i'm stuck in a loop, or like. Like i'm sleepwalking if that makes sense. And I never really felt like I had a sense of self. i'm always struggling, which is why I. realized that i'm non binary because it's like easier for me to just not. identify with a specific gender. I. have noticed that when i'm lighting my sage or lighting incense like I. I don't intentionally burn myself. But it happens. I. always felt like I had really bad anger issues, but I just keep it more internal. and When I was a kid I actually did end up. choking someone in school. And I noticed that I. guess like I dissociated a bit when that happened. Because. In the moment like I didn't really feel anything, just after I felt like really intense guilt and. It was bad. Also, I think, two years ago, I had an argument with my mom and. I got really overwhelmed and cut my arms. And I also noticed that, like I dissociated when that happened because of felt like tunnel vision. I. Am also really paranoid right now, like, I feel like i'm running out of time or. someone's out to get me. If you like there's hidden cameras or that like i'm going to get raped. It it's just. it's a lot."
298.0,Provider,aren't you still taking the adderall.
11302.0,Patient,"know. And that's something that I noticed also I haven't been taking my medicine. Which. I should be because of. Like withdrawals and symptoms, as well as with my sertraline. which no one told me about that I can have ssri discontinuation symptoms and. I feel like the what's interesting is I always felt like this, even before being on antidepressants and. adderall like a full like this, since I was a child. So I don't know. I don't know."
298.0,Provider,um do you have abuse trauma in your background.
11302.0,Patient,"I. I don't remember my childhood. It feels more like I have like. memories, but they feel like dreams. I was. assaulted back freshman year of high school i'm. More like. being touched without my consent. and Know like I feel like i've had pretty okay. Life."
298.0,Provider,Okay. Are you taking the certainly.
11302.0,Patient,Not right now either not taking both of my medicines medications.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. So one of the so one of the things that i'm hearing is and, yes, yes, you probably you do have a lot of things that qualify for beat ppd. But it also sounds like stress is a factor and not having the certainly is lowering the serotonin levels in your brain, which will increase the anxiety paranoia. The feelings of disassociation would be from it could be helped by having the subtle things started again, can I give you a prescription for certainly."
11302.0,Patient,um I actually have the prescription through my primary care doctor.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and what is the dosage on that."
11302.0,Patient,100 milligrams.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's that's a decent amount Aaron. What is your reason for not wanting to be on the adderall."
11302.0,Patient,"um. mainly because. I feel kind of paranoid on it. I don't know if, like it's because of the dosage like I would like to start on a lower dosage. But I have a family history of high blood pressure. And just a lot of health issues and I. I don't really like taking medicine in general. So."
298.0,Provider,Well 25 milligrams the xr is a pretty low dosage. 70 milligrams I have a lot of patients on 70 milligrams a day of of it if it's not helping you and you don't want to take it don't think that i'm pushing it on you i'm just trying to give you education that you know it wasn't that high. Did you feel like it gave you high blood pressure.
11302.0,Patient,"kind of like my heart rate was like. Increased more than usual. and Even if it's like I know it's not a high dose but, like, I still felt paranoid like I would pick my skin constantly on it. and"
298.0,Provider,"that's huge. yeah and that's where. that's where being on the circling would help with skin picking. It would help with serotonin now you're seeing shawn right now right. Yes, are you guys working on the PD type things."
11302.0,Patient,"Yes, but she said she wasn't diagnosed me with COPD."
298.0,Provider,Okay. hold on just a second. You definitely i'm looking at the criteria for BP you've debt how's your self esteem.
11302.0,Patient,it's always been low.
298.0,Provider,You you meet the criteria for BP T how about your impulsivity do you feel impulsive.
11302.0,Patient,"I actually did. impulsively have sex with a friend. A few weeks ago. Because of like stress. yeah um. I also well it's probably because of the ADHD, but I also tend to overspend when I don't need to."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to add a diagnosis of ppd to your file right now, but you probably already know that there's very little medicine treatment for BP. Establishing a lot of it is work that you need to do in therapy and. What would be interesting to find out is in a year from now, if this if we reassessed if you felt like it's still stuck. um. Is there anything else that I can help you with today."
11302.0,Patient,Would it be possible for me to lower my dose on adderall because it was helping with. school.
298.0,Provider,"which you like to try a instead of a role or have you tried instant i'm looking back at your you have tried instant you liked the longer acting better. Okay, let me see what the lowest dosage is that I can. prescribe. Oh, they have a. They have a 10 1520. So do you want to go to."
