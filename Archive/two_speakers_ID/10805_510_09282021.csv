510.0,Provider,"hmm that sounds new, but you may have shared it maybe."
10805.0,Patient,"Early early on early on that, like. A sister had a house on her property that I could move in eventually but be okay well we've kind of always been like our goal my our our as my parents and I in the girls. goal has kind of been. Eventually, you know whether it's tough to read the graduates or after list of graduates whatever we'd move up near family because we don't really have family here. Besides each other. they're all they all live about two hours north of us. So I know I don't have familiar, you are with where we are. Well, my answer my data house. Last week."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"And he sent it to Riley and I and, needless to say, we went yesterday I looked at my parents, but today, and my dad may be making an offer on it."
510.0,Provider,Oh wow buy a new house.
10805.0,Patient,"Well, buying it's actually 10 acres with three houses."
510.0,Provider,Oh it's like a compound.
10805.0,Patient,"It would be. wow so it would be um yeah therapy house for me it's easier to explain so they're actually all kind of modular. Pre maps are regulars I don't like calling them trailers because that's to me that's not what they look like inside they're gorgeous. But. Originally, the plan was my dad texted me and he's like what you guys think and really and I are both like yep let's go like you know. And I riley's kind of been our she's had her heels pretty Doug lately about not moving because she wanted to go to the junior college out here, because it's really good for ag."
510.0,Provider,um.
10805.0,Patient,"Okay, and then all of a sudden, she apparently changed her mind that she doesn't care where she goes well, she cares but as long as it's near another school that's."
510.0,Provider,Is there another school that she.
10805.0,Patient,"Can. 20 minutes away it's actually. it's actually closer to. Potential the potential new house. Then the JC is from. Like the new houses and it's hard to explain, but my sacramento know. Like i'm. Past roseville. yeah okay I didn't know if you knew it okay."
510.0,Provider,"yeah i've got all my jobs i've worked a lot of California, but I know exactly where that is yep you go to houses actually in Sheraton which, as I said."
10805.0,Patient,"The town of Lincoln. Which is right outside of roseville. Okay it's like rotate on Lincoln and then you're going towards like marysville. Okay don't get. A little white church, but. It. sounds like 1300 people."
510.0,Provider,A small town.
10805.0,Patient,Does that appeal to you yeah.
510.0,Provider,yeah okay it's a small town. Small acreage 10am 10 acres.
10805.0,Patient,"10 acres. yeah and the school is so. Hopefully the school might be a marysville but it's about 20 minutes from the potential new house to a similar school that she'd be just as happy at. Okay, but it's."
510.0,Provider,it's more of that sure Riley.
10805.0,Patient,would have been arrested yeah alyssa we'd have to change everything after we just got her settled.
510.0,Provider,We just got our settle.
10805.0,Patient,All of this would not be until summer so she would.
510.0,Provider,"they'd finished okay so she would finish okay Oh, I like that, because I finish off their school years. yeah yeah."
10805.0,Patient,"Potentially change her for sophomore year but you would change anyways because you probably wouldn't necessarily have the same teachers, but she might but it opens up and that we could technically not send her physically back to school. Because my mom will be retired and my mom could almost homeschool her."
510.0,Provider,which I. Might this long want to do that.
10805.0,Patient,I think my dad told her that was part of the agreement.
510.0,Provider,Oh okay. As long as there's discussions and people and.
10805.0,Patient,"appealing to people I shouldn't into the situation. So that's. kind of where we're at, but like so yeah I mean I don't want a ton of time on it, but it has a lot to do with like where i'm like i'm struggling a little bit right now with it. Because like originally so my dad texted the House, he goes, what do you guys think. The big House would be like mine, because there's three. The little House will be my parents and the smallest is like i'm. The cutest thing ever but it's like a little apartment."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,Like a little one bedroom with a little office in a bathroom and like a cute little living room with like a wood burning stove and.
510.0,Provider,"It was like a studio yeah and it has like a wet bar so it doesn't have like a full kitchen, but it has like a sink in like a little."
10805.0,Patient,bit rich fridge.
510.0,Provider,"And it can be perfect for Riley the air fire and microwave the child would be fine yeah because she doesn't cook anyway, so you know she comes to moms. mm hmm."
10805.0,Patient,"We went to it, so that was like kind of the thought process and I was like I don't know how mom's gonna my mom is going to think about living in like the smaller one. Because there's wants to 2000 square feet months 1200 square feet. And then rallies it's like 800 square feet. We got up there and we looked at it, while it's beautiful I knew it was going to be a deal breaker for my mom if I took the bigger one, and she got smaller one."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, so you think that."
10805.0,Patient,Now I know it was so I gave it up. Like I honestly looked at my data was like i'll take whatever.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"Like i'm not I can't complain because they're buying the. House but. i'm giving up, I guess, I guess, is where this is where it should, this is the only part that's frustrating me right now i'm scared because it's a huge change a huge change, I mean. i've lived in this House for 10 years, this is my like i'm kind of giving it my end up independence, a little bit. A lot. I mean parents live like yelling distance for me. The new house is like on the same proper I mean maybe. yeah. And i'm fine with that, like that doesn't really bother me too terribly much."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"And because my diner super close, but the problem having right now is like i'm giving up a lot of like my favorite parts of my house."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,it's not that i'm giving it up in this probably goes back to like you and i've talked about my mom a lot. She doesn't see what kind of that everyone's kind of sacrificing a little bit or a lot. To make this change for our family.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"And like today, like railing and my dad when he showed me even all this up we're super excited because we all want what that the House yesterday. And we were like cloud nine when we came out of there like this is so cool like if we can make this work, this is, like all of our dreams come true when I took my mom's just just like, and it was okay. Like it's it's not even that it's like she just. Like we're all sacrificing things like I had I kind of got mad at her she's like oh we're gonna have to change this one, I have to change that like when I looked at it was like you know I could live with this out just the way it is. You know the new houses and she's like we're gonna have to change this, I might have to change that, and this is not really what I like and did you know kind of like complaining."
510.0,Provider,Already and sounds like she was being more negative.
10805.0,Patient,She was being negative and i'm looking at her.
510.0,Provider,Writing and.
10805.0,Patient,"I was like we're all going to have to make sacrifices. I was, like, I have three favorite parts of my this House now. My kitchen table is like my I mean I could probably live in a tent if I have my kitchen table in it. like this, my favorite thing it's beautiful farmhouse four foot by eight foot huge benches like. You to table like it is literally my favorite part my house it doesn't fit in the new one."
510.0,Provider,Nine even in the large one.
10805.0,Patient,"Oh wonderful art one, but so not only am I, giving up like a bigger house and giving it like my favorite parts of my house already have. And she's just like. Like like it's frustrating me that, like and I kind of got them added earlier and that's where I live, this is one big thing like because I was terrible I didn't wonderful entry of the three, but I have the ideas of the other two that we talked about. The Sara one I."
510.0,Provider,"I have, I have those listed so we'll go through."
10805.0,Patient,The Sarah was.
510.0,Provider,"An effort, which is great."
10805.0,Patient,"There at the Sarah one it's written. That was easy for me to write well done easy for me to write, but it was. Things have manifested where I figured out some things like I know I want to work on how not to like let everyone paint on my parade like when I get it like how like especially my mom. Because like. How to take like understand that she's just a selfish angry person. And what and that's how she is. But how did not like."
510.0,Provider,personalize it.
10805.0,Patient,"In in like we're super smart reciprocates word. Well, I started."
510.0,Provider,"You sort of feed into it, then you sort of."
10805.0,Patient,"get into that like I get it yeah. Because I got mad and i'm like, why are you like that So what do you mean like. we're all excited about and we tell you Oh yes, this this and so that's, the first thing comes out of your mouth is Oh, I think we have to move the gate and we have to do this and I need this, and it means that, like, why do you lead, why does she like, how can. We just always have had a problem to. How can someone have so many things good in peace such a negative person."
510.0,Provider,yeah and.
10805.0,Patient,"When i've had when i'm like the opposite end of the spectrum, I tried to be a positive happy person and i've had a lot of shit. You know, like you know, like i've had gone through a lot of shit lost like 40 years. yeah I know today."
510.0,Provider,"it's okay. it's okay to let the tears out, I think, part of it, though, is. We you love your mom okay let's say you we know you love your mom but you get frustrated, but the reality is you can't change your mother. So you can predict. Part of her conditioned repetitive responses and they get the same response out of you, and so really it's the power within this dynamic is you, recognizing. it for what it is and not responding your you have a choice to either engage and kind of get frustrated like you always do because her responses are very conditioned it's it's how she presents it's it's you know what you have known most of your life I think it's fair to say."
10805.0,Patient,No it's true.
510.0,Provider,"And i'm being able to regulate your response, because you will not be able to control her you're not going to be able to change right you're not going to be able to all of a sudden. flip a switch turn a dial be like I want you to respond differently, I do it's what makes relationships complicated you're not going to and you're gonna have to accept in these moments she might be negative, she might just really rain on the parade."
10805.0,Patient,And or.
510.0,Provider,"I know, but you have them the choice of how you will respond and that's how you start to own the regulation piece like you don't feed into it, because in a lot of ways, and it could be very unconscious She invites the conflict She invites the the kind of tug and pull right."
10805.0,Patient,Back right.
510.0,Provider,"And what would it be like, if you just didn't respond, it would be a new shift for her and she probably wouldn't even know what's going on. But it would certainly be new for you, because the same old responses are getting the same old frustration in years and i'm not minimizing i'm not saying."
10805.0,Patient,That you don't have the opportunity to express the frustration.
510.0,Provider,"But i'm wondering if you could try, I mean I know it's easier said than done, but this is this is how people change the dynamic, because this this keeps going and it's not working for you."
10805.0,Patient,"Well that's what that was like one of your things was like what do I want to do like. Future appointments, because I know how they are it's our last day to you know. yeah and. So can I have to get a lot of stuff out right now, because I don't know what i'm gonna talk to someone next."
510.0,Provider,"May, so not just I want to pause and I want to reassure you intend to you, you are going to be in good hands, so the good news, I can report is, you will have manny as your therapist. So who does your you're ready to go last night. Oh, you didn't okay so."
10805.0,Patient,"No, because we were in the car coming back from Lincoln."
510.0,Provider,"security environment okay. yeah so have some continuity, which I think will be good so later this week after my last day which technically is 10 one on tend to all those changes will be happening and then."
10805.0,Patient,all the time.
510.0,Provider,"If, for whatever reason, that care navs are not our reaching you to schedule, you can call. So you already taken care of and nanny will be your therapist."
10805.0,Patient,"And you'll notice that makes me feel good because, like I you know, obviously each other, have you but he's like. A lot of it is groups are way different, but like his. Like he's good at calling me out kind of place where like you guys can both like make BC the other side and then. are supposed to be, but like I feel confident that he'll be good and."
510.0,Provider,"Then, and it sounds like you feel comfortable so that you will have continued support. But this is there. yeah this is. To this is where you and me and can talk about that dynamic like. It really is an opportunity, if you see it as an opportunity i'm not going to play this dance, but my mother and see what it feels like it's going to feel really awkward and weird and like oh my gosh i'm not responding I not engaging in the dance like."
10805.0,Patient,"I think she wanted, you know. It was so easy for me to do, like, for my last relationship, it was so easy for me what wasn't easy. But towards the end I figured out like you know, because it was a narcissist like it was kind of the same idea was like. I stopped fighting like I just kind of stopped being like feeding into it like I acted like I didn't care, even though it was killing me because. I knew that he was getting the reaction, like me, he what he was doing was doing it on purpose, he was doing it to get that reaction out of me so like but."
510.0,Provider,"I knew you weren't safe, I think, to even really kind of have open communication. With your mom you."
10805.0,Patient,know I.
510.0,Provider,"know I know. And you can still try to have the open conversations, but I think mom has a lot of conditioned. She has challenges so she kind of."
10805.0,Patient,"She is without way with Riley too because, like Riley you know it's very with her it's very black and white she's very it's an everything has to choose. I hate to use this word she's one of the most I don't know how you could be like a selfless selfless profession because she's a teacher and A and B such a selfish person. yeah like. She does."
510.0,Provider,"yeah and. You can see the different roles, I mean you can."
10805.0,Patient,"See the general yeah. She comes home an ax two different like she and I, and I guess I don't. think you and i've talked about this, like my dad is my best friend."
510.0,Provider,I know. It to.
10805.0,Patient,"My he's like my first idea and. To see him like. gets so excited about that, like I know he felt the same way I did today. yeah she's like Oh, I like it, and when Riley and I looked at them, we got the card we're all like we love it like we it was just easy. And it felt good. Like I just I told this I haven't slept them last couple days, because I love anxiety about moving just because it's leaving this place, this is where."
510.0,Provider,"You can there a decade, I mean they were divorced like this is a first piece, I was."
10805.0,Patient,Like really independent.
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
10805.0,Patient,"i'm not like i'd love to look close my dad my mom I think i'm probably going to read out the words. know if the property is big enough it's 10 acres it's. it's gorgeous like when I was there and I stood on that deck because there's which i'll show you a picture of it when I started the part deck of what would be my house it just felt right. yeah sounds like in your bones, I was paying attention that. I was telling my friend, Nicole who's i've met through Sarah that like when I was there, it was like she was it felt like she was there, because it reminded me of her house. yeah it was like."
510.0,Provider,She was healing healing for you.
10805.0,Patient,"It was like she told me look at this I know it sucks because I have this emotional connection to a House that has like I don't know how many freakin offers on it, because it's a 10 acre lot with three houses and it's under $700,000."
510.0,Provider,"So wow. Yes, constantly a lot of interest but."
10805.0,Patient,"Between us i'm lucky, because my dad could pay cash for all of it."
510.0,Provider,yeah.
10805.0,Patient,"it's like where we're at and like you know and i'd have to sell my house which is fine, I mean my dad was my house, but with some my house first like he's got it planned out relatives in our school and like that part doesn't scare me. it's just the change like I know once I get there. i'll be happy because I have my sister. Who is we were never close ever ever ever like hurtful to our lives we're not close. To my dad got sick. yeah together. Because of my mom's selfishness in the way she was dealing with him being a sick. She her and I had like we had to figure, or should I like her, and I did, because we were the only ones that were going to make sure it was okay. Because my mom was just enrolling and she did it she just was, and I think that. will say I lost a lot of respect for my moment that happened when he got sick I kind of did like she just."
510.0,Provider,didn't assign a lot yeah. Sometimes you just really respond. Like. In the House and my shoes differently sounds like mom. was really struggling.
10805.0,Patient,"Like oh my dad came up like this. This whole conversation about her, but when we got out of what he got out the hospital he looked at me and we're still gonna be tons of heart heart because he couldn't get out of bed for like what and it was taking care of him. I was taking care of the clock, while I was working and raising my girls and my mom just went to work. looks at her when he got to the hospital and he said, would you even have cared if I didn't come home like that's how he felt. Not like not to us, you know was like we were. my sister and I were like. On the feminine asking doctors questions like. I don't even know I don't know if I shared this with you because I dont still don't think she knows i'm sitting still active."
510.0,Provider,yeah did share that I remember that. You are yeah.
10805.0,Patient,"yeah baby. that's how much he does he received her. yeah it kills me because my dad notch because he's my dad but he's like to anyone around like my neighbor cluster street she's closer to my dad's age. She was told me if your dad was single like because he's just like he's just like an amazing person they don't make people I can't like he's such a he's such a selfless me and when he loves he were very similar, I think. My journey and we love we love hard. Like we don't give up on people, we take care of the people we care about and so like to see my mom be such like a heartless mean person it to him, especially it destroys me because it's like he's."
510.0,Provider,become. You become active.
10805.0,Patient,"But i'm so protective that it makes me angry like I get mad when she's mean to him I get mad at her that she didn't clean up the House it matter that she. You know if I don't cook for them heats taco bell because she won't like it's it's it's a huge problem and that's a huge thing that was part of that question, you know what do I want to work on next is I gotta figure out, I know I can't figure out how to. pick up my best to kind of just fell apart same time."
510.0,Provider,Like you need to talk about it.
10805.0,Patient,"yeah I needed event, and it was meant to, and I was having like a big conversation with my friend Alan the guy that i've been hanging out with. me I had like an honest conversation with him, because one of my other big reasons I don't want to leave is because I don't want to lose him off the relationship part the friendship art. Because between talking to you and talk to me like him being around it's got me into some pretty dark places lately, you know. And i'm like I told him I was like I don't want to lose you I don't lose another person by moving he's like yeah I want to see you all the time to take you to dinner he's like but i'm not going anywhere. he's like all come see you he's like see you up there because it's. Sorry."
510.0,Provider,"it's Okay, no apologies. i'm gonna throw it out there just is do you have to move, though, do I mean there's a lot of pluses I hear it, but I also hear you know, maybe there are some negative might be the right word, but maybe you know if we look at both sides, I mean."
10805.0,Patient,"The good outweighs the bad of. yeah the good outweighs the bad. i'm about to be closer to Mr this is. Another because I kind of we kind of. laid out the negative so far, yesterday I had a huge moment where I cried because we've my dad even said it. He looked at my brother in law, he said, I know this sounds weird he's like, but this is the first time we've all been on like we all came to a huge conclusion that we were already to me and i'm ready, I wanted to leave this area for so long. It is the bachata black hole, you will ever meet. The type of me and i'd like to end up with they just don't exist here."
510.0,Provider,I don't know it sounds like definitely more. there's more calls a new.
10805.0,Patient,And they did.
510.0,Provider,"That okay well that and I was sitting there, so my dad told my brother in law he's like, even if we don't get this House like our biggest thing with between all of us is, we are all on board to go, like all of us."
10805.0,Patient,"Okay, because before it was like Riley was put her feet it like every time a little each person of kind of putting their feet back like kind of put their heels in. Not so much me i've kind of just been like ready forever because I just. I want a fresh start I want. As much as. Not having the memories like like moving away from all the good stuff it's leaving a lot of bad stuff behind to it's a fresh start. That, I know I desperately like need from which is a change of like it will that have been close to my sister it's it's literally the same road my sister was on."
510.0,Provider,Like they do. A lot of access to supports. I sister literally like a hand.
10805.0,Patient,"Physical. Have i'm going to do, and then my aunt who i'm super close to, so my sister's house is less than a 10 minute drive. it's on the same road but it's a very long road. And then my aunt is like another 10 minutes past my sisters so. Those are now like my uncle he's only seven year his wife that or her husband said it backwards. we've grown up like brother and sister he's only seven years older than me. And so, like when like alyssa. stopped breathing which was baby like when she first heard her first seizure. I had more of a reaction when I saw my uncle than I did when I felt my husband. Like he I knew what he was there, it seemed. Like it was weird if. We just have a very. Like i'm on. And he's and he's going to be 20 minutes away, you know and he's like their their kids my kids are super close my biggest thing was of sitting there talking to my brother. my brother in law, my nephew my oldest nephew he's 11. My dad Riley and I. And we're all sitting on the couch and just kind of talking like we're talking about the House we're talking about how my dad was happy that we kind of all made that decision."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"And my diverse yeah we all came to the decision, he looks at me for me to say, and I looked up my nephew I started to cry and it was like for all aboard to move, but my nephew started to cry. Because he's never had me he's never had my parents like. he's gonna get the kind of grandparents and my girls got because he's still young enough like when he's going through high school middle school. us like he'll get our support to you like, in fact."
510.0,Provider,That is good. That is.
10805.0,Patient,"And he's like he's like wait what kitty he's like you guys want to move here like he was huge like it, he started to cry so I started a card more. That he is. My boy I always say. Because I have three nephews there 1111 nine and seven or love it they're all."
510.0,Provider,"Those are fun ages, I."
10805.0,Patient,"i've said it, since the day that they were like the last one was born, he just turned eight and I always say that those three boys, will be the only men that will never break my heart my dad like. They love me like they are because I was like I don't know photos and alyssa to high school there because it's a new school blah blah blah blah, unquote like the anti i'll be there. he's like i'll make sure she's okay and he'll just be a freshman when she's a senior and that's fine too, because I, my my little cousin Julie Ann is a same ages alyssa which is great older so alyssa will never be at. The potential new high school. Without and family member there."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"till she graduates. But like. That part doesn't scare me like alyssa I know that she wants to go to and she understands it because I said. She knew my parents were going today to look at the House and I said, we have an hour today, or we have 30 minutes."
510.0,Provider,We only have 30.
10805.0,Patient,I was looking at the clock I didn't even realize that.
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. We can go, I do have another appointment will if they don't check in we can continue we'll just go. Long as we can."
10805.0,Patient,"Sorry, I realized that I was like shoot I should probably after that so i'm gonna go out, but it was a strong little stuff but."
510.0,Provider,"Now this is big stuff, this is a big you know these moving is huge and it would really create a whole new dynamic with your family would reshuffle relationships and re establish. new ones and kind of deep in other ones, you would definitely have more. Time with mom I mean it, this is big. No, this isn't looking at stuff down this is."
10805.0,Patient,"I know it is. it's huge stuff that and I feel I feel ready I just don't want to like I want to figure out how to since I know now, this is the decision we make, I want to figure out how to make it like I don't know about that sounds maybe wrong. With my mom like how. Like you're saying like how to not be the one that gets back at her all the time, like damage, because my dad was when you guys always have."
510.0,Provider,"it's about disappearing. Well, someone someone out of the two is going to have to disengage and if you're really. Never going her. And i'm not and i'm not excusing her behavior I am helping you realize that you have the capacity and the autonomy. To change the dynamic and because so often people are like well they made me mad and they did this, and I, I have no choice but to respond know you always have a choice, then you might not like the choice, and I feel very uncomfortable and you might feel like I gotta say something. yeah he might still have those moments, and that you do, but once you realize that you have the power to disengage. I think it might be a little sobering for your mother, because I think there's a dynamic that she likes to go into these a lot of times, sometimes it's unconscious people can be very unconscious and they just sort of this is what they kind of enjoy and they."
10805.0,Patient,Like the conflict.
510.0,Provider,would be amazing to. know that power and disengage.
10805.0,Patient,"figure, how to do that."
510.0,Provider,You can you just you start practicing. You start recognizing and having better awareness there she goes again there's that negativity. I.
10805.0,Patient,will be.
510.0,Provider,"I see it. i'm gonna. i'm gonna i'm gonna do i'm going to respond differently, you don't. Normally respond, I always do, and I."
10805.0,Patient,"The other day she said something and I was a moment my dad handle this because I knew he was gonna pop off because he does do so Riley Riley really bad because she's really bad because she's a smart mouth anyways but then she's. protective of me so it's like that. it's not fun. I don't most the time lately I don't have to say anything, because one of them, does it. So I just kind of sit back and wanted to implode, but I think now I don't know the health thing is like exciting for me and i'm like i'm okay i'm like i'm good with moving it's just. I wish I could find a way for her to appreciate the opportunity we're getting and even though we're all making sacrifices it's going to be better for everyone, but I don't know if she's ever going to see that I just have to let."
510.0,Provider,You focus on you and how you're managing it. If you're going to wait on her to kind of see it in a way that you want you're going to get frustrated you're you're going down a path of you can't control it.
10805.0,Patient,I don't know. Why this might sound oh there goes.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, oh wow is that the compound. Oh yeah."

510.0,Provider,yeah no it's really nice.
10805.0,Patient,"it's really, really nice and it's but yeah it's like i'm excited about it, I just and I think that was that was my biggest thing today, I was so mad, and I was like. Why is she not as excited at us why does she not appreciative of the fact that, like she gets to retire in their houses are going to be paid off and. Like she's looking at it like oh i'm giving up this 3000 square foot house in like it's gonna be harder on everyone, because my mom is a hoarder and I will do that."
510.0,Provider,um.
10805.0,Patient,yeah she's one of those people that like. keeps you know the artwork from probably when I was too she can't throw anything away.
510.0,Provider,Oh wow okay. yeah that is more psychological and.
10805.0,Patient,"she's abandoned she has abandonment issues because her dad left, but she portrays it on PR rightly because. it's her situation similar to riley's with my ex husband."
510.0,Provider,I see.
10805.0,Patient,"So when Riley talks about it's like oh my dad did this, my dad did that it always everything always turned around to me back about her. It never it's never like she never like validates your feelings it's how she feels. about what you have going on in your life how she can make it about her. And if you recognize that again."
510.0,Provider,don't get into the engagement and the dance.
10805.0,Patient,Because they're not it's.
510.0,Provider,"sort of like it's a it's a rabbit hole and because she's trying to fulfill something that might not ever be fulfilled and and really it comes from within. yeah you know that, just like, no one can do your therapeutic work and she projects, a lot of it, and if you recognize it's. The projection it's not about you Jen it's not about Riley but it's still I know it stings there's intensity. or I get it, I get it."
10805.0,Patient,"No, I missed the first like you guys always need to go to show you guys need to go to counseling together my mom and my sister. Little opposite of me like she has like hardcore like does not put up with people's crap and i'm sensitive like in my so my sister just kind of shuts it off Is that how mom is i'm not gonna i'm not going to deal with it."
