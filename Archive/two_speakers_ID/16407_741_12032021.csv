16407.0,Patient,So.
741.0,Provider,"Have a plan in place The other thing is that we also need to build. A support system outside of your family, friends. structure. And also keep you from getting bored and and then the other thing that we might want to do is try to figure out the best way for you to change your living situation, so your dad's not push button right. Okay, so that's probably what we, we can work on for a little bit and and see what kind of headway, we can make on that Okay, and so the next thing I want to do is try to get you. A appointment for next week, so that we can talk some more. Let me get my calendar right so next week. When are you available."
16407.0,Patient,"anytime around 1130 to noon, is when I take my lunch so i'll be available every day that time."

16407.0,Patient,This time.
741.0,Provider,"I like how about. And how about Friday at noon. Okay, and I will see you. For the full hour."
16407.0,Patient,Okay that's fine.
741.0,Provider,"And usually that's fine. Okay, I won't bother me if you fit in edmonton. ordinarily I do much, but today I can't so that's all right, I, so I have that there now let me go in here because I have to put in the system, I put it on my calendar, but then I had to put it in the system. So they do all this fun stuff."
16407.0,Patient,"Also, my suboxone normally get a week's worth and they cut it down to four. songs out of the box and also."
741.0,Provider,and shipping a refill on that.
16407.0,Patient,"I i'm not sure how because, even when I went the doctor said it's supposed to be seven, but now i'm only getting four and it doesn't say any refills on the thing."
741.0,Provider,"Okay well what you're gonna have to do is you're going to have to call the virtual clinic and tell them that you need medication. Okay Okay, and I will I will probably go ahead and send the message to the rx. Okay, that they know that you're out of medicine, at the end, that you have seen me. Okay perfect so that will help. The situation. Okay. Now let me get down here at the appointment I don't want to mess it up, so let me get this in here 10 1210 2021. At 12pm. There 12. In the wrong box. That. Individual 60 minutes and with me. scheduled all right there we go is done you're in there and so. Well, how to do it Okay, after that, the next then on the 17th I am out of the office and on the 24th i'm out of the office because that's the holiday that's new year's Christmas Eve, but I will be in the office on new year's Eve. So we can do that on new year's Eve, we can we can set you up for the same time. Okay Okay, and then. we'll have to figure out what to do those other two weeks okay. Why i'm going to go ahead and put this in here because. I don't want somebody else to get it, you know. So it's easier if I go in and do it now, I saw dude. And, have you done your initial bloodwork and drug screen."
16407.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, I need you to do that really bad okay that's another reason why they're going to mess with you about your met about your suboxone. Okay. you've got it the DEA as well as bright heart health. Policy says to have to stay up on your surveys, you have to do a urine drug screen every month. and You have to attend two times a month counseling with me. Okay Okay, so you you're gonna have to get caught up on that stuff so when you talk to the virtual clinic about your medicine how them that you need the the. See to do your surveys that are overdue right now. Okay, and that you also need help with making sure that a urine drug screen you're going to have to go to a lab to do."
16407.0,Patient,I know where the labs that I know.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, just make sure that they have the order so that when you go, you can. get it on. Okay, because i'm glad I saw that because that that's important. Because that they're going to mess with you on your meds if you're not if you don't pay attention to that you know. So. I want to help you make this as painless as possible. There is a lot of responsibility to having treatment online unfortunately it's not. It is simple and it's pretty cut and dried but it's not as simple and cutting drivers everybody thinks to this. yeah so there's a lot of responsibility with it. So, but personally I prefer it. Because you talk to me in your car. So all right, we got you down and we'll figure out those other two weeks next week okay."
16407.0,Patient,Perfect Thank you so much.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, you take care Okay, if you email me OK."
16407.0,Patient,"OK, I will do, thank you."
