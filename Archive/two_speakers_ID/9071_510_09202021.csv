510.0,Provider,This is terrible on therapist I have an individual therapy session with patient crystal doorway date of birth 929 83 we're just waiting to see if she checks and enjoys. hi crystal does he not check in with a virtual clinic I didn't get a notification.
9071.0,Patient,yeah I did.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, you did Okay, maybe they're just behind okay perfect."
9071.0,Patient,Like the person seemed like they might be new or something yeah it was weird.
510.0,Provider,"Oh there it is if they were just a little bit behind. All right, all right. Oh i'm so glad you're here, because I know last session, it was a little shorter. I sent you that self care, so I definitely if you wanted to talk through that I want to make sure we go through yeah. Okay, do you want to go there is there something specific you wanted to update me on because i'm also very interested to see if you're able to keep your assessment with the psychologist."
9071.0,Patient,"Yes, I was, I definitely did um it was not what I expected at all."
510.0,Provider,In a good way.
9071.0,Patient,"Okay yeah i'm basically just a she was like very, very, very kind and very supportive. Good Chris like I barely had to say anything. And she was like i'm not kidding I this is literally how it went after week, she asked me like a few things that were wrong with me I listed a couple things and then she asked me. She said, are you married I said no, do you have kids no. Do you live on your own I said no, I live with my parents, just like oh oh you're not going to get any problem for me, no, no it's fine no. Like okay so that's what put it over."
510.0,Provider,"yeah well i'm sure there are other questions, though, that she had for you, but yeah like she was very supportive."
9071.0,Patient,"yeah um so it sounded like the only only other question really that she had was she was like after she said that she was like well, let me ask you let me, let me do this really quick and she's she was like a. what's, the capital of. California who's the governor spell something backwards and I have no idea why she was asking those questions you might know, though."
510.0,Provider,"yeah it does it's part of a mental status exam just to sort of make sure you're oriented to you know time place etc, and so and you're not demented. A lot of times those are very initial questions, to make sure you're not showing early signs of dementia, which I don't think you are but yeah pretty common it's called a mental status exam questions."
9071.0,Patient,"got it okay yeah so like it was very quick, I mean I don't even think it was five minutes, it was just like in and out really fast. Okay, and yeah it was I felt, really, really relieved after that."
510.0,Provider,"Oh good crystal So what are the next steps, then does she write a report and submit back to kind of the whole system that's managing your disability."
9071.0,Patient,"Right yeah I mean that's the impression that I got but she I don't I it was so fast like that I didn't even get a chance to say. That, I also have a physical with a regular doctor I guess. i'm in like a month and because she because she said yeah like you know you're not going to get any problem from me, you know definitely continue to support your disability or whatever and. And she said she said, you should hear something within four to six weeks that you've you've gotten back she didn't worry don't worry. And, but she didn't know about the physical thing, but I mean that unless that doctors does nuts, or something I don't see why that would be a problem, either, but."
510.0,Provider,"yeah her role is to do the mental health P so i'm sure all report, the two reports are coming in, together, just to confirm. yeah she's still disabled yes she's still you know needs the support okay well good i'm glad you're relieved i'm glad you got to the appointment, I know you're really concerned i'm so glad to hear that piece. yeah okay."
9071.0,Patient,Good.
510.0,Provider,"All right, yes, that is canoes well let's talk about and so glad you actually printed it out so let's talk about the self care because that's what. That was one of our sort of we we figured That was something that was really lacking just to really give you the vocabulary, but also. You know, strategies and examples about self care to see if there's any way you could sort of be increasing your therapeutic toolbox when it came to self care. And so what were your thoughts to the eight dimensions did some stand out more than others and curious if maybe you're doing things really well in some dimensions and, obviously, are there areas you think you could improve upon, but what What was your overall impression by the list."
9071.0,Patient,"Well, my first impression. was OK, so I guess I do. I do like do self care um because I was. It was. Now that I know i'm like okay there I do do a lot of self care um. There was one there was one category in particular i'm trying to figure out for sure which one where it was like almost nothing, though."
510.0,Provider,um okay.
9071.0,Patient,"uh it could actually be well environmental is is. is probably one of them. For sure, because I rarely go outside like I really don't go outside. Like I said, unless unless i'm leaving for an appointment I don't even go outdoors at all so. Okay, and I know that's not."
510.0,Provider,"Just well is that by choice or is that tell me a little bit more about that I know you go outside for appointments So what about yeah just to sit and kind of take in some rays, no tell me about a little bit, are you fearful of being outside or. inside it."
9071.0,Patient,"i'm okay that's a good question, so let me see if I can talk it out um so. I guess. Well, I mean because a lot of it is you know if I go outside where, am I going to sit or be. I guess in the front in the front of the House it's like all in front of the neighbors like I don't want to go out there in front of the neighbors and it's. Okay, though i'm in the backyard, we do have a big backyard, but it's. I feel like it's kind of like my mom's Turks i'm like she just just like a couple months ago bought like a swing even for her to sit in. And out there, and I mean that sounds like it'd be great you know, like a place that would be supportive for me to sit in physically supportive. But it's just. I don't know like I think it's also like maybe. I mean it's physical or and maybe psychological that you know just the the staying in my room thing is just kind. Of like. yeah I mean I don't I can't really i'm not really articulating this very well. um."
510.0,Provider,"yeah other places, because I didn't know you have a lot of medical complications, so please forgive me i'm i'm not i'm just asking as far as your capacity. What about is there anywhere in your neighborhood is a walk too much would that be too taxing on you. um I guess yeah if you don't feel like you can even be in your backyard that's that's pretty tough to hear on but is there anywhere in your neighborhood or community that you know you can be outside or or do anything and just curious."
9071.0,Patient,I mean I don't when you say that I don't feel like yeah you know no. But. Like the walking part like that sounds like it'd be great like i'd love to take like our dog for a walk i've wanted to do that for years. But. And I think I mean I did a couple times but it's just like you said it's so physically taxing.
510.0,Provider,Like that okay.
9071.0,Patient,"i've been like like yesterday, like last night I went downstairs because I live on a two story and downstairs is our garage and like a little compartment. that's kind of like my mom's place sort of um so I went down to the basement yeah last night and Oh, my goodness, like just walking down the stairs going into the basement. i'm looking for a couple things in the basement I mean I was like practically running out of there to get back upstairs to get to my bed. Because I was so depressed I was so like I was gonna pass out like. Like how am I supposed to go for a walk I can't even like walk down to the basement without being so winded and i'm with was like my body feeling like it's crushing on itself like."
510.0,Provider,"No okay. it's just. Like when you get to appointments Is that how you feel as well, when you get."
9071.0,Patient,"them oh yeah it's like running far and then throwing the seat back like to recline and like catch my breath and recuperate and you know i'm all sweaty. So yeah that's that's always like you know, like going into if I want to run into trader joes for something it's like so fast like I got to know where it is oh I pray that there's not a line. i'm standing there, like a torture and then it's like kind of like almost like running you're getting back to the cars best possible so like thinking and i'm not really running but um. But just thinking of walking like that in theory that's like a great idea but i'm not there or able to do it right now but that's my goal, that is a goal of mine."
510.0,Provider,"Okay okay well, and so I hear environmental might not have a lot under that dimension Okay, and I appreciate your honesty, it sounds like you know, maybe a future goal to try to kind of. Be outside and you know i'm I would love the bag, if you could be outside in your own backyard, but it almost feels like you know you feel like a you know, a visitor, even within your own home, I know you've sort of described that which is tough. Well it's a good tell me about. yeah tell me about the areas that you feel you're doing really well and I do I knew, you were doing self care, but this at least sort of validated that so tell me about the self care and the dimensions, you feel you're doing really well."
9071.0,Patient,"i'm see very well, I would say. I say spiritual. Surprisingly, I would say emotional."
510.0,Provider,For my absolutely.
9071.0,Patient,"Okay that's good. um remind me to come back to emotional because there's something in there, I want to talk about and then. i'm. I mean, I guess, I would say financial i'm doing pretty good considering. um and then i'd say intellectual, even though. yeah intellectual um as far as my capabilities, yes."
510.0,Provider,"Sure, I would also probably less physical I know a lot of the actual physical things like taking walks we just talked about, but I think trying to keep your appointments. getting enough rest nutrition hydration. I do think you do those things as well, would you. agree definitely yeah. Okay, and you've talked about social I am and that might be an area, you wish was a little bit you know, boosted up a little bit, but I think you do reach out and have. supports maybe not necessarily all through family but friends um I think there's an aspect there Okay, and I like that spiritual you listed okay. Go tell me what you wanted to share, about the emotional, so I think that's. Great i'm glad you were validated and then since that there are areas, you are doing so Keep up the good work. and seeing the dimensions that either areas that I could maybe boost a little. But talk to me about the emotional what came up for you in that dimension."
9071.0,Patient,"um Okay, so I think it's something that you have mentioned, and like at least two other people have mentioned like within the last couple weeks is journaling. um So when I was like a teenager early 20s I used to keep a diary. um but that, as far as journaling I don't know if that's something different than a diary or kind of feels like it is. something different, so I guess, my question is. If I were to start journaling like what really does that entail like. What what I really be doing."
510.0,Provider,"yeah so to me they're interchangeable, but there are people that use their journaling and very specific ways so some people will use journal prompts. Just to you know, for today, you know i'm going to take a journal prompt and, for instance, a journal prompt could be. You know what is it that I, you know, want to see different in my life, you know there's very specific questions that they answer within a journal entry. Some people it's completely free form you literally write what you want to write it could be, what happened that day, it could be about a stressor it could be. anything, it could be good things to it could be all of the above, the whole point of the journaling, though, is, I think, and not think I think there's been good research out there. It D centers you, which means it allows you to sort of take a step out of your head. and get the thoughts that you're having in your head onto paper, and so it kind of gives you that ability, ideally, to take a step back read what you wrote. And kind of gain some insight and perspective, a lot of times to people will journal about a question or a concern that they're having to see if that will help them sort of write it right out kind of some scenarios and kind of help get some perspective. I didn't and the good thing yeah it's just for you and and, obviously, making sure it can't be discovered, or you, you know you want to make sure that you have that privacy, because. nobody's checking it for grammar nobody's checking it for some testing it's truly does you getting those thoughts out onto paper. Much for many is extremely extremely helpful, but not always it's not a guarantee but it's interesting you've had a couple people kind of say it so are you thinking, maybe you want to revisit that as a strategy."
9071.0,Patient,"yeah I do um, I guess, I could like maybe go on Amazon or something and like typing journaling and maybe like see I don't know like maybe like a dude would you recommend like a maybe like a guided type of journal, or just like literally like a notebook nothing and just treat."
510.0,Provider,"It really it's really your preference, there is no right or wrong, I know i've had some clients. asked me for journal prompts if you would find that helpful, I can email you some examples and you could use those But some people they don't need prompts they just they write for the day. You know how i'm feeling they there's gratitude journaling you know you people part of their journal entry for the day as they write what they're grateful for and kind of. Practice, you know that sense of what I already have enough focus on what I don't and kind of practicing gratitude. So really there there truly is no right or wrong it's just. Some people I know they they thought it was just a little easier to get started with some journal prompts but others, they just go for it and they don't they're off and running they have lots of things they already want to kind of get out onto paper."
9071.0,Patient,yeah I guess I guess that's like my thing is that I do have so much that I want yeah and it's like.
510.0,Provider,"You just you start with the present moment and you go. Here I go i'm going to write about whatever yeah there's that's the beautiful part of it, and you can always come back, I know, some people are like I journal every day, and then I. You know, then I didn't for a week and that's Okay, no judgment right I don't want you to judge yourself. You do it as often as you find helpful, but for some having sort of that routine built in kind of provides them that confidence right and that that safe place where they can just list, whatever it is that they're. they're thinking feeling etc and know buddy's there to judge it it's really just for you truly."
9071.0,Patient,"that's funny that you say that too, because, like, I think I do feel that way like somebody's going to judge it because. Like even just the way that I will write things sometimes. And it's like if it doesn't look just so like i'll just rip it out and start all over again like that's not I don't like that, like I wish I wasn't that way."
510.0,Provider,"Okay yeah the whole the whole intent is really just to give you almost have a therapeutic outlet right it's not hopefully to create more frustration of all my handwriting's really messy i'm going to crumble it up data, you know. It really is just to give you that time and space to kind of reflect and to get it get those thoughts out emotions onto paper. And for some people, they almost utilize it as like a session right there, like my journaling is going to be from 10am to 11 i'm going to journal my little heart out and then after that i'm going to put it away and. that's the thing you'll hopefully you'll start to feel and what resonates with you of how to utilize it some people will journal throughout the day, some people are like no i'm just going to do it at this time there truly isn't any right or wrong it's. Right, ideally, incorporating it into a therapeutic self care strategy, but it definitely sounds like you're you're thinking about. was great yeah yeah."
9071.0,Patient,So yeah that that's definitely something I want to start i'm going to do that.
510.0,Provider,"Perfect oh that's great crystal i'm glad for that what else from that self care list was there anything else that you're like yeah, I think, maybe I want to kind of. Work on this too, and if there isn't anything that's okay you're doing a lot of good stuff but I was just curious if there's anything else that kind of stood out that really piqued your interest as maybe this is something I want to do."
9071.0,Patient,"yeah not you put it that way, where is it um it might be an occupational, but I think it was in two of them, and the. Like learning, it was like learning or taking a class or something like that."
510.0,Provider,"yeah okay yeah that definitely could be an intellectual or occupational. yeah if you could take any class. Any class at all, what do you think you would do what would you like to enroll in."
9071.0,Patient,"Oh well, okay my mind was with all kinds of different directions, because I was like what would I like to really be linked up to go to school for a no. But I know what you're asking you're asking like a class, and that is what I thought is what i'm talking about because, and the reason why, by the way, is because I had that wellness check thing with jocelyn I think her name."
510.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah mm hmm.
9071.0,Patient,"um and she was like somehow it came up about taking classes, I guess cuz we were talking about my education and how, after high school I took a couple college courses, but i'm like all online it at home college courses. And it was so unsuccessful because I physically could not keep up with it. And I got I would I would fail and then it's like i'd be determined again and it just physically wasn't possible like me trying with pointless. yeah, but that was more in like a regimented way. um so but I feel like I am or she even she was kind of making me more interested in taking a class but that's the thing I don't even know what I would want to take. My don't oh I don't I because that's the thing I don't know even how to do it, I wouldn't even know where to look really. I mean, I guess, I can just like Google it but i'm not even like aware of like you know just random classes, that I could take like online at my own leisure um I I don't i'm not even sure, so I don't I don't even know where or what. yeah but I will give you a city."
510.0,Provider,"yeah usually there's um and your you live near larger cities so a lot of times they'll have. kind of what they have adult kind of you know interest classes are not for credit or not for college credit, but basically it's just areas of interest that people want to take a class, it could be a language, it could be art, it could be anything and i'm wondering if there's sort of like. yeah I would definitely start with an Internet search and just type in adult you know classes and just sort of see what hits. you're not necessarily looking for a degree or anything like that or credit, but a lot of times it's just more of a recreational fun artistic class something in that vocational you might be able to use the vocational. But I would imagine there is something, but I would start with the Internet search because that's the beautiful thing is you just type in some different keywords to sort of see if there's something that can come up. yeah and it sounds like you might even just need to do some value and preference clarification which all that means. crystal is kind of learning what you do like right, you know I get it like I don't even know what class i'd want I got to kind of figure out some of the things I sort of enjoy. and And so, sometimes just kind of going through. And kind of learning a little bit more about your values like what's important to you what interests, you and that might be something you could journal about like what is it that I really like what do I care about what what do I want to you know read about or learn about more. You know, is there an article or something you've listened to that you're just like yeah I really want to learn more about that and that could sort of that's how we do values clarification we just start to. peak our interest and maybe there's something that you've recently read or her and you're like yeah I want to go a little bit deeper into that that could be a way to kind of explore to."
9071.0,Patient,"Okay um you, you mentioned language actually I don't know if I if i've mentioned this, but I have been. um maybe that's what's kind of like triggering my. Intellectual. Interest more so is because I have been. kind of re teaching myself Spanish. No, I didn't know. That yeah I just started about. Maybe four or five months ago. i'm just on the dual lingo APP."
510.0,Provider,yeah okay excellent yeah mm hmm.
9071.0,Patient,"So I had taken a college class in Spanish, I got a I might have done a plus actually um but. yeah so I was somewhat familiar with with Spanish and I was interested in it that was when I was 17. Yes, I graduated early um but uh. yeah so it's like 20 years later, all of a sudden, like i'm realizing I don't really remember a lot of it and and I and then it's like somebody was telling me about the dual lingo APP and I just got into it was like okay i'm doing this i'm just gonna do this."
510.0,Provider,"Exactly and that and it's not anything formal but that that type of activity crystal is really good for your brain health. Yes, it's using different parts of your brain and it's really kind of creating new synapses and firings within your brain it's a good thing. When we learn new things we try new things it's actually good for our brain when we get sedentary and we get really in this regimented everything's the same, we think the same thoughts. it's, we have to kind of break out of that and I know it can be uncomfortable but that really those sorts of strategies awesome awesome so I want you to continue that but maybe you want to do something more formal. And in Spanish. You never know that's but, unless you try it doesn't allow you to sort of reflect on Is this something I like Is this something I don't like I you know what I really like this, I want to do this more. And I think having those sorts of things that you're interested in would help shift just feeling like you're a diagnosis of pain management right you're more than that you are way more than that. And there could be some things that. You can continue to incorporate around self care so excellent i'm so glad you really took the time clearly you took the time to review it, and so, but."
9071.0,Patient,yeah and i'm glad that I realized that. Because I was like I didn't even know what self care really.
510.0,Provider,"was now you do now, you have the vocabulary and actually you're doing a lot of good self, care, but now you know the other dimensions and seeing how else you can you know boost some of the other areas that's good awesome awesome awesome. so glad we had. A full session today, now we are scheduled for our final, let me just double check yeah and."
9071.0,Patient,It gets a.
510.0,Provider,"It is it's Tuesday September 28 at 430 Pacific time so I look forward to doing that, obviously, you can bring whatever you want to talk about in your. final session, but just be thinking, how you want to utilize that i'll have some reflective questions for you. I know we haven't learned worked together long but certainly i'll have a few to to ask, but you will certainly have plenty of time to talk about whatever you want for our final session."
9071.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going to be very thoughtful about it and intentional like with with our time because I feel like, even though it hasn't been like a long time it kind of feels like it has been I feel like you really know a lot about me and understand a lot about me all right."
510.0,Provider,yeah no and I. met first oh good okay well good I I will be intentional as well with some questions that I want you to obviously be able to bring your questions and use the time that you want so good all right. I wish you a wonderful week so glad you got through that appointments.
9071.0,Patient,"And we'll talk next week. Alright, see you guys."
510.0,Provider,Later so you're so welcome bye. final session with crystal is next Tuesday we've confirmed zoom room close.
