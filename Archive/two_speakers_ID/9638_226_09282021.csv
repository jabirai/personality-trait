226.0,Provider,Take care of yourself or oh so he was kind of this person was going into what was going on.
9638.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I just said, you know how are you and and a long response about. Understand it's been a walk you know a few months since I saw him in person, so. Okay, probably just slowly or wants to. talk as much as he would, if he was in person."
226.0,Provider,Are you guys gonna get together.
9638.0,Patient,"um I hadn't gone that far I was just trying to. Get in contact, but maybe. i'll just. yeah we'll have to see just have to reach out to more people I at least want to. be better at reaching out and making connections or re establishing connections, or at least just. Not over analyzing if I wanted to say hi to somebody."
226.0,Provider,"Okay sure, so I like that you're just trying to reconnect it sounds like. yeah Okay, so not necessarily get together, but just hey how are you thinking about you one know how you're doing."
9638.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know I guess I. It feels like it's a little harder to make a plan with somebody for me. I feel very. I don't know I think I feel really vulnerable if I put myself out and say, I just want to hang out. If it's something more casual or somebody inviting other people that I feel. More. I want to say safe but more. Like there's less at stake, I guess, in a way."
226.0,Provider,yeah yeah no no you're saying. Are you having like having feelings of loneliness or are you like. To talk to me about that.
9638.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm not seeing a whole lot of other people outside know my family my live with or. After my niece and nephew we may be said. In a few people at work, but still kind of new and. Trying to be cautious not really you know. eat around people inside. If I have to. I mean I that I might have to reevaluate that."
226.0,Provider,You know.
9638.0,Patient,"Like I was thinking, I might have mentioned, I have to I think quit some of my mental needs. forward as much as. physical or. viral I guess get today."
226.0,Provider,let's talk about mental needs money mean.
9638.0,Patient,"It just meant, you know. I was trying to go to the movie theater this week it just got busy Friday was the day that I stayed at work late. But my plan was no i'd been. not going into the theaters for over a year, but then I thought you know i'll just be safe, will try to pick. Up you know time in the afternoon before most people were off, you know, though he's busy time and just be sure to wear a mask and set apart so. Right, even though I guess i'm taking somewhat of a risk, I felt, you know it'd be. more beneficial for my mental well being. To do something that I miss doing."
226.0,Provider,yeah did you end up going.
9638.0,Patient,I didn't just because I was staying late at work.
226.0,Provider,Okay got it I got you know.
9638.0,Patient,"I could have I could have pushed down, you know, in a later time but I was just saying i'll try to do it. Maybe this week."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, I like that I like that you're taking that step, I think that's important I like that you're trying to get back to the things that you like to do and being taking precaution definitely yeah so that's a great first step."
9638.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it's been mostly with my parents, but sometimes going out to eat, you know places that have. too busy or something, but you know, in the past that might have been. more cautious to to do that, but I think it's better like I was saying it's better for me to. Be social and take care of my well being mentally as well as physically."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and I really like that you said that I like that, because there comes a point with all of this, where. You know. Our. Our emotional. needs have been put on the back burner. yeah right um you know just are. Living some semblance of a life that was similar to like pre coven. You know, getting back out there. You know, being around people without having that fear you know all of that is really, really important."
9638.0,Patient,"yeah. And I think i've been putting that. On the wayside, for a while."
226.0,Provider,"Because. There comes a you know. It comes a point where. want to get back in balance with everything as much as you possibly can, like life's about balance right it's about it's about. homeostasis and. You know everything's kind of move in and change, and you know you want to you want to get to a place where. you're obviously feel safe. To be able to go out. But to stay isolated is really, really not okay yeah for anybody, you know to feel so afraid or paranoid or concerned. That you're not doing anything you're not going out you're not around people you're not engaging with people. it's not sustainable. at all, you know i'm. An only you can get there right we'll get there in your own time but. I love the awareness that you have around this I love that awareness, I love be knowing that it would be helpful for you to start doing things that you really enjoy doing. Because it's important. You know, and something that i've been talking to you know clients about is. I understand the fear and I understand the concern around and there's a lot of scary stuff that's been talked about with coded and. You know one thing to focus on that might be helpful for you is to as long as you know your immune system as strong as long as you're doing things to keep your immune system strong. Whether that's like vitamin C or other supplements exercise getting some sunlight eating healthy food, drinking a lot of water getting enough sleep. Keeping your stress level down. Those are all things that help keep your immune system strong."
9638.0,Patient,"yeah Those are some things I put you know, on the wayside sort of covert started. And not having a job. Sure, like everybody if you're at home, all the time eat a lot. I know because I had high. cholesterol, but."
226.0,Provider,"But if you're focusing on keeping your immune system high I would hope that that would give you like you know, because if your immune system high if it's if it's strong you fight the fight off. viruses you fight off, you know the common cold. Right so. that's another you know if that. So you're taking responsibility for your health. Right so as long as you like, if you can say yes i'm doing everything that I can to keep myself healthy that's just another thing to say Okay, I feel safe, I feel I feel okay about this, I feel that I feel Okay, about being around more people going out and doing things. So. Maybe looking at it from that perspective, instead of like ooh. I don't know. might be a little sketchy."
9638.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah my crowded take two minds, you know what people said, try to you know you can. Live your life is words you just have to do with the safest way. So you know. Like I was saying, if it's going to the movies it's taking precautions, I can take."
226.0,Provider,What we're gonna see.
9638.0,Patient,I was going to just see the. Ching Chi Marshall Marshall words.
226.0,Provider,Okay. So um. Do you get to go out do you go with your parents when when they go out to do you feel safe doing that.
9638.0,Patient,"Oh yeah we went one to a to a like a. Beer bar restaurant. Just ate outside and you know we. were all taking precautions if we're inside we wear a mask eats outside when we can but. You know, being there in the moment I wasn't feeling. worried about it, maybe you know, the same thing that happened a month before I might have been more concerned, but I think I have to. just push myself and. say you know what am I worried about is it. Something i'm putting on myself, or is it a realistic."
226.0,Provider,"Right absolutely no like that yeah is this reality based is this is this real. or is this just a fear that i'm having and why am I having that fear and kind of breaking that down having that inner dialogue with yourself okay Why am I afraid well you know and then again Okay, is this reality based. Oh good I like it, I mean you know. you're you're hitting these goals that you're setting for yourself, so you know, like, I encourage you to just continue continue doing this continue setting these goals continue meeting his goals keep doing this like moving forward yeah. Do we have another appointment set."
9638.0,Patient,"I don't think that, let me check my schedule."
