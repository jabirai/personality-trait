And it is not my preferred. role I just prefer to be a nurse and take care of my patients. plus the staffing there's a lot of high turnover at this hospital so. I was the it was a 12 hour shift I was the charge nurse for that Plus we only had a triage nurse for six of those hours so for six hours, I was also the triage nurse, and most of the staff that we had. toward the last couple of months were new grads or floats from the MID search, so there were a lot of like critical care type things in that that. I had to be a huge support system for them as well as do the two other jobs, I was expected to do."

15014.0,Patient,"So far I seem to be doing okay. Okay i'm just using tylenol and motrin. i've had a couple of history of migraines I had, I actually was having a little quite frequently but i've actually suits leaving since being off work i've had only one so."
726.0,Provider,"Especially this one. yeah stress is definitely. One of those things that will mess with your health absolutely get my. Yes, silence."
15014.0,Patient,26 years of being an er nurse it yeah I.
726.0,Provider,You know the ins and outs of how it works well and I also think I reached.
15014.0,Patient,"My maximum of it, I think. To be real honest to. The pandemic has and people's behavior and how they look at it. We have a very large. Anti vax Community up here. And anti mask. But, yet they come in and. sick and go save me save me and it's like yeah i'd love to."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
15014.0,Patient,So I think. yeah it was I had gotten to a point of. Just was on overwhelm and. Was replacing the drugs with taking care of myself in an appropriate way.
726.0,Provider,"And I don't think I mean you were during a time on during the pandemic, and so I mean it sounds like the you were wearing a lot of different hats at that job so you realize, a lot of."
15014.0,Patient,"I was. A lot of different things, plus you know, doing the you know. triaging people who you know. You ask the simple question of is like I have all these questions i've got to ask I don't care i'm not invested in them."
726.0,Provider,But when you ask if you're vaccinated they you know go into this whole tirade and it's like okay I.
15014.0,Patient,don't need to know that just need to just need to check a box i'm good okay.
726.0,Provider,"i'm a mother i'm. Was gonna ask to. Now that you are are with your mom and how is the the dynamic with you and your mother, do you feel more. You feel less stress, are you still having like that desire to want to use."
15014.0,Patient,"No i'm not and with my mom because it's both my son, and I would kind of tag team her. and She doesn't have very coping good coping mechanisms never has so at this point she's also kind of getting confused and what she. She kind of forgets that she has a lung problem, so all of a sudden, when she can't breathe it it's really scary because she's not so it takes a little extra bit of you know, reassuring her and calming her down. But. Yet her. Our dynamic is mostly good it. Okay, she can tend to go to a. Little nasty place when things aren't her way, sometimes, but that it's. Completely realized that's not necessarily her that's her fear and."
726.0,Provider,Did you were you ever in patient had a rehab facility after that happened.
15014.0,Patient,"No, I was not."
726.0,Provider,Okay okay. So. Do you have any questions as far as bright heart health any questions about groups any questions about anything at all.
15014.0,Patient,"No, I guess i'm just kind of. trying to figure it out, as I go along and. letting things come up when they're you know. When they're there and present for me. it's all kind of new to me i've never been in a therapeutic situation before so."
726.0,Provider,"Oh OK, so this is the first time urine therapy in a way. Is that okay. yeah it's definitely different because it's not. I think um when you're working especially er or working in in that kind of field, I don't think people really talk about how they're feeling they're just kind of getting through and just trying to do. Right, they can."
15014.0,Patient,"I have another good support system, I have my two best friends are our nurses also so we have over the years, all kind of dependent on each other. To to share those horrible moments that we've gone through and we can understand that it's not some you know, because we know the stuff that we see is not something that absolutely everybody else can see you know can understand or you know. It can overwhelm them much quicker than those have been through the same type of thing."
726.0,Provider,yeah and probably because you have brand new out of school nurses it's totally different than having a veteran nurse that knows what they're doing so i'm sure that anxiety and that stress. definitely something correlated with the migraines and grief if you've only had one so far.
15014.0,Patient,I mean yeah yeah. Definitely definitely.
726.0,Provider,"Still i'm just gonna i'm going to ask you, these questions really quick as part of the initial treatment. These are suicide questions okay so have you wish, you were dead or wish you could go to sleep in that week oh."
15014.0,Patient,No.
726.0,Provider,and actually.
15014.0,Patient,"i'll go ahead. I have a long term problem with insomnia, as well, so."
726.0,Provider,How okay.
15014.0,Patient,"Yes, wishing I could go to sleep, yes, but it was wanted to wake up."
726.0,Provider,"And Have you had any thoughts about can yourself ever. nope no okay. So it sounds like you have a support system your two best friends your son. What are the things that like if you were to see yourself, maybe three months from now, or six months from now, how would you want yourself to feel differently or how would you want your life to look like that would be different from what it is now."
15014.0,Patient,"Well, some of the differences just. Being not on so much overwhelming people to take care of the other things that I need to take care of in life, like my yard, which is a disaster things just kind of things home stuff. That kind of stuff that."
726.0,Provider,"So, when you say like stress management like managing or stress in a way that's healthy for him. Okay."
15014.0,Patient,and probably work on. My I have a tendency to procrastinate so.
726.0,Provider,Okay.
15014.0,Patient,And i'll work on. Getting that a little less than my life.
726.0,Provider,"So i'm heather the way that it works with this program is I will see you twice a month. And now it. Is that would be every two weeks, and what I what I usually do with with patients is, I would say to them if there's a specific day or time that you want to keep your appointments for that easy for you to remember, we can do it that way, so I like to usually scheduled. yeah two appointments ahead of time, so that is already in the calendar and then. Let me look on your chart really quick to um. He also in the program you'll see those sending surveys and it. yeah on our system it'll show up if it's red it means it needs to get done or. or they sent it to you, maybe you haven't done it yet or you did it there's people that do it, that same day, and it doesn't it's not reflected yet on the the chart so I always update you on how your chart is how everything is and then. Right now, the only thing you have on your chart is a peach Q nine so you can ask. Vertical clinic to send that to you and. get that done."
15014.0,Patient,"Yet there was one that I they sent me and I had trouble logging in and I just haven't had a chance to call them and say it, it gives me the first page of the form, and when I fill it out, I hit next, and it goes it wipes all my answers and goes back right to that first page of the form."
726.0,Provider,Is it on your phone that you're doing it. or on a computer.
15014.0,Patient,"I tried on my phone I also I actually I used to most of my stuff on my iPad. So i'm enjoying it on the iPad but then I I tried on the phone too, and it it did it both for for both of us."
726.0,Provider,"Really oh. I would, I would ask them then i'm here that's weird that's that's that's a weird thing. It shouldn't be yours yeah cancers and they're not going through. So heather if it's okay with you, it can we schedule for. Two weeks from now. Either if it works for you, I can do. Work for you or. For better."
15014.0,Patient,afternoon should work better. yeah I haven't any group that I like to go to and it said at 10 in the morning it's 10 to 11 daily so.
726.0,Provider,"I have here. If it works for you, I have. Two o'clock and it's on September 30."
15014.0,Patient,Okay.
726.0,Provider,"If you like, I can try and see two weeks from that day, it could be the same day same time."
15014.0,Patient,That sounds perfect.
726.0,Provider,October 14 I can also do two o'clock as well.
15014.0,Patient,Wonderful.
726.0,Provider,So i'm heather any anything you want to ask or anything you want to know before.
15014.0,Patient,"No right. Again, just learning it, step by step. I think i'm still in that I don't know what I don't know what I. need to know to ask."
726.0,Provider,"Oh OK. Just because i've had so many other people now that come into the program new. and basically on we meet twice a month, so if you feel like you need more than that, or you feel like you need more support, and we can change it, and we can see each other weekly if that works for you. And just make sure, like, I always when I mean with my patients, I always go over their chart to make sure everything's good, because what happens is, are you getting medication through bright heart health through a psychiatrist or. or know either."
15014.0,Patient,i'm not. taking any medication right now at all.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. Well i'm."
15014.0,Patient,gonna be 12 but.
726.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, because in our program we have a we have a chronic pain we have a substance abuse group we had an eating disorder. Forget just the other one jumps on my head, but on some of these programs though they'll do like they'll prescribe medication. Yes, I because."
15014.0,Patient,"Dr London to talk to me, I had my initial assessment with him and he we we discussed some of that and. I felt like at this time. Just staying where I am not adding anything to it see me. And if I need to go to a different place we will."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, so if I could be of any help at all, however, please don't feel free to contact me if, if you call and you want to make an appointment for that week just go right ahead and do it OK."
15014.0,Patient,OK OK.
