383.0,Provider,"Thank you, thanks for coming back and having a conversation. that's."
11321.0,Patient,me. i'm handling it okay right now. I do on Fridays. Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays. I don't drink during the week.
383.0,Provider,So when when did you start again what did you.
11321.0,Patient,"about a month ago, I would say, probably around almost the same time, where I stopped talking to you."
383.0,Provider,"and Are you still in that place of are you, you know just in a place it ambivalence about wanting to stop or."
11321.0,Patient,I mean. I don't want to stop.
383.0,Provider,No.
11321.0,Patient,"don't don't do but i'm being self destructive. When I first check myself in the facility I. don't think. I think I probably just said, went straight to a psych Ward vs. vs a. I don't think alcohol was the issue more than my depression. I don't I don't have cravings of drinking. I don't know. that's how I feel."
383.0,Provider,what's just if I could ask you a few. Questions about your pattern of thinking right now. yeah i'm.
11321.0,Patient,"figuring now I mean exactly like Friday nights you know, like even about few hours, now I probably like six or seven crusher now probably you know have drinks, with some friends. I mean i'm still you know laundry a lot so i'm pretty much a lightweight. i'll drink about a few shots. Probably stop. Saturday Saturday night, maybe just a couple shots and Sunday during football a couple shots but that's that's the extent of it has been a pattern over the weekend, for the past month."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you had any binges or have you gone over that a couple of shots have you drink more than that, a few times in time."
11321.0,Patient,"On Fridays, I mean just for me would be like yeah maybe about over. Five or six shots at stop, and again I basically go to sleep."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. So what do you feel like, how do you feel like you want to proceed in terms of. Looking at you know what. What the what the what it is for you to do this, and if you feel like you're letting yourself down in any way, or do you feel like and or your or your relationship with your family members. And word, do you feel like you know this is. This is a you know I mean this is kind of like you said I don't want to stop, and this is kind of what I do and it's I don't really see it as a big deal too big, of a deal."
11321.0,Patient,"um. I think my relationship with my kids. or wife is a pretty good. I did talk to my wife about this for a while. And I don't think she's concerned i'm not concerned, but I do want to continue therapy I didn't want I didn't want to continue therapy and lie about this stuff okay. And I think it took me a while I think a lot of it was not being able to face you because you know I mean. I think it was few weeks ago you brought up well. You know I I still haven't stopped drinking that the nightcap phil I thought back at that time you know, I was thinking, I went on the weekends. So if i'm a little bit ambivalent to continue this but I felt something that's what I need to continue because I don't need to continue this from my work my work doesn't quantity this. I don't think. But. um I think it's I felt it was healthy if I really was going to. To do this, to. Just to continue this from my mental well being."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm okay great.
11321.0,Patient,"This you know. Just to get it. And so yeah I mean part of the times of missing is because of having work obligations, you know at the time that I was supposed to be scheduled that part of it was because I just didn't want to face talking to you about me drinking again."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11321.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know. I want, I want to be able to keep this in control. But think I am. But I don't want to stop our check ins. Okay, if that's okay with you."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's fine um. So what do you what are some things, maybe that are coming up for you, apart from related to alcohol. That are that you know you want to talk about what do you what is. Or do you have."
11321.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think I talked to you before like. One to have a different persona. Online and I think recently I messed up on that again. I got in a Twitter work with a troll who kept. Trying to bait me and likely going to get me in some sort of trouble with work."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh and. Go ahead, maybe tell me a little bit more about."
11321.0,Patient,"Everything so there's this guy who just hates our company and really hates me. And started just. again being critical about me on Twitter and I I said something on Twitter was probably was an ideal. I saw a. I saw him in a hockey game and and said something to the effect that how did he get such good seats, was it because he snuck into the handicapped section. And he made a whole video saying that I was against disabled people was a little bit was fair but yeah."
383.0,Provider,Oh gosh. When did that occur.
11321.0,Patient,This past weekend.
383.0,Provider,"Did you when you responded in that moment, and to the Twitter feed were you. Was it on the weekend, or was it."
11321.0,Patient,So we do.
383.0,Provider,"It was on the weekend Okay, do you know if you had been drinking a little bit or."
11321.0,Patient,chicken the day prior.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. And when you responded, did you were you remember being pissed off. Yes, okay. stuff okay. So that's. right there that that is just. When we're when we're angry. You know, to to sort of. Implement or a personal policy of just giving yourself like a two hours or something or three before you respond or overnight, or you know at least some some time because when we respond. In the middle of feet of feeling of being angry our responses usually are not very they're not just not the wisest thing. yep and and take it from I mean i'm someone who knows, I have, I have many you know. have had my run ins with sending texts when i'm not when i'm angry so."
11321.0,Patient,yeah i'm dealing with that right now i'm on week one week suspension. and
383.0,Provider,From. Our place.
11321.0,Patient,"yep so my boss, I talked to my boss on Sunday. Yesterday, and they said okay well you know let's talk again on Wednesday. And then we'll see what happens."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, are you concerned that that. that's eventually going to turn into anything else or."
11321.0,Patient,"Hoping they're gonna fire me they'll probably now we're just restrict me from social media which. Well, you know. Because i'm more good than bad, but this is a this can be yeah. Well, I don't know I mean i'm not worried about losing the job. Okay they'll do all this stuff far but who knows. it's been in back of my mind."
383.0,Provider,it's been in the back of your mind okay. How much is this bothering you I mean this could be considerably troublesome. i'm wondering if this is.
11321.0,Patient,Somewhat bothering sure sure. sure. that's something that didn't want. To do you know. Something I promised myself with Google.
383.0,Provider,Which which was.
11321.0,Patient,To have a better persona.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. and tell a little bit about. The persona that you had before or or.
11321.0,Patient,was pretty polarizing.
383.0,Provider,So there were a moment said before you would get into arguments online or present a position that is kind of an antagonistic or. Correct okay. And you had a break from that because you were in recovery process you've been you know you sort of put put the pause on work for a while and.
11321.0,Patient,was doing good with being. Good positive image man this happened in this guy who. I should never ever took the bait.
383.0,Provider,Are you equally disappointed with yourself and also angry at this guy.
11321.0,Patient,"For so yeah for sure. If I were to do it all over again, probably with taking them back probably just wouldn't have responded."
383.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, are you also managing sort of feelings of anger toward toward the sky or for."
11321.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I think that's past I haven't had. For sure now it's just now that's affected the you know. That it's gotten internally yeah. The consequences, who knows what's happening, I mean, I think. Ultimately that made the consequence of me being. Being being not being a part of. You know as the spokesman of the company."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
11321.0,Patient,"Looking that's as far as the table, who knows."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. and Does your. boss know about that you're going out with friends. I mean are any of your friends co workers, I guess that's what i'm known."
11321.0,Patient,Boston some totally sober.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
11321.0,Patient,My bosses have covered it. So I could be accountable Tony many pins.
383.0,Provider,"Do you feel comfortable telling him, you. Had."
11321.0,Patient,"I did right he's he's heard of even for yes. Okay, I had a chance to."
383.0,Provider,So I imagine right now there's kind of different feelings going on. Inside of you um do I describe what what.
11321.0,Patient,"We know. Right now, or the red is like not knowing what's going to happen. Or that is trying to put things in perspective. You know. Like I said, probably yeah and I regret that far. I don't want to have the deal, I don't think my customer to be able to be there no. Limits backlash but."
383.0,Provider,Is it within a pretty big backlash in terms of.
11321.0,Patient,"is pretty contained I don't think it's super. I don't think it's anything. Where they need to let me go I think they have to just kind of take this week to decide what they're going to do, and I think i'm so important to comprehend that if they decide to do anything they have to they have to negotiate with me to do it. i'm good we'll see."
383.0,Provider,"So there's you know how you feel. about this situation and then there's. A decision that maybe you might make about stepping forward, you know. And with resolve that you know you're not going to do X, Y or Z. Are you are you. Is that going on inside of you kind of like okay i'm not going to do this, and I imagine that that it is. I don't know sort of which one is more prevalent in you right now, just like feeling crappy about this or. This resolved that Okay, you know. For worries."
11321.0,Patient,"You know I mean back my head This worries sure you know, like, I mean if if this didn't happen, it probably would make it easier to move forward, a lot of my projects and agendas. Right and now that this happened that makes it more difficult. Regardless of what the outcome is. wonder, so I think about that think about."
383.0,Provider,It makes it more difficult for you to move forward projects that are meaningful to you. Correct okay.
11321.0,Patient,"Correct. Right. And that's one part of it. that's probably part of it, another part of it is like. Not knowing how far. The consequence worthwhile. To be."
383.0,Provider,"Well um. And then, how does this relate to the. For you, how does it relate, for you to the fact that you. have been drinking on the weekend."
11321.0,Patient,"I don't know how much i'll drink tonight. You know, deal with that, like Margarita tried to just get super fucked up I don't know. I just have to see. To see if the stress actually makes my habit. or this drinking make it worse, will see you will you'll know two weeks."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well, maybe we can. So we can look a little bit at your approach. You know, is it is an undeniably stressful situation from from power is landing on with me, you know it seems like a very stressful now it's not 100% stressful if we were going to scale it, but it is a stressful situation that you're in you know you're. So. You know the drinking has been a way for you to escape from the stress for you to feel some relief from the stress for you to get you know some moments of feeling something else. That that's what alcohol does you know it gives us a different feeling than what we're feeling before. So. If. In terms of your approach about what's going to happen tonight or tomorrow you, you can decide what's going to happen tonight or tomorrow, you know you can decide that you're gonna you're going to. You know run around the block 10 times you know. or get on your bicycle and. Get on the trail, so you know. You can decide what you're going to do to deal with the stress, I mean cuz you, it is up to me it's undeniably a stressful situation So what do you how are you going to handle that stress and not the decision. And, and you might approach, it is just a suggestion, but you know just with a bit of harm reduction, like Okay, let me go get on my bike and do. Three routes of wherever you go in your area, you know i'm gonna do i'm gonna do three three routes of it and i'm going to come home and i'm gonna take a shower and i'm going to really try to like not surpass you know X amount of of alcohol tonight. And that's my decision that's my decision to make and making it right now, you know and to can throw off some of that tension some that stress in another way, you know. How does that fit with you in terms of just that."
11321.0,Patient,"concept of like deciding what. To do right right now and and i'm just going to see. Like what my in the first instinct says to do. And then analyze it and then be honest with myself, because if I feel like I just wanted to get so messed up just to take myself away from the stress, then. that's something I have to think about right, if I can just or drink or make the choice not to drink it or just drink a little bit I don't know, but now it's a test for me. To see what you know if i'm around other people and how I deal with this and everything else i'm gonna be honest with yourself, you know let's see what's going to happen tonight. and see how this is going to be in to self destruct a with this kind of spiral me down to a row that we want to go to can or i'm just going to jump a little driven not at all."
383.0,Provider,"yeah you could drink, not at all, I mean I, I think that. That idea of like supporting yourself, you know how can you support yourself and because. Being being kind or being supportive. Rather than than destructive. Is that is a happier place it's also a more clear minded place for making decisions so. yeah yeah."
11321.0,Patient,I don't know what i'm going to make on this. i'm not going to make super destructive choice we're going to kill myself that's not gonna happen.
383.0,Provider,Okay okay good then i'm glad i'm.
11321.0,Patient,"going to overdrinking know, do you know i'm curious to see myself i'm going to handle this and then and then like be honest myself and the next time we talk hopefully. That gives me more. Understand myself. But i'm curious to see what i'll do."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. well. You have the power to make a decision about what you're going to do that's i'm just kind of trying to remind you of that you have a choice there'll be a great poll perhaps they'll be a great Pole like sometimes there's a Pole, to scream and we're angry there's a Pole, to. You know, throw everything up and say screw it whatever I mean there's there is that Pole, but there is also. A decision to not go with that pole so and that that takes that pool is a strong force so you know it's. it's it is. It takes it's like getting the bull by the horns or or the reins you know, because that of that that that energy that's starts to want to go in that direction. Even if you can pull it back a little bit if you can you know rain rain in. The next day will be so much better for you. The next day, you know you will think yourself. See ya okay well and I hope this has been somewhat helpful, how are you feeling."
11321.0,Patient,"It has been it's going to allow me to continue these things, because I finally trying to face it."
383.0,Provider,Good yeah just by being here I mean you're facing.
11321.0,Patient,yeah I want to know more so than other children one minute left.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, that person's actually going to be a little bit delayed, so we have I have time to make your next appointment, which i'm not sure."
