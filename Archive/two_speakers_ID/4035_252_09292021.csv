252.0,Provider,"So what are some of the things that you would like to work on, while you're working with Brian or."
4035.0,Patient,"I would like to figure out what makes me go. I think this time I kind of know I mean I. I just don't know why it gets to this point with me and it was driven I think this time partially by what's going on at home, but then partially by at work. I have been doing the same thing for about 10 years and least eight and. got a new boss well same people i've always worked for but they put this lady in charge who's never been a boss and she's a micromanager and I just. I mean every 10 minutes, she was calling me when different offices, but she could watch exactly what I was doing. And every 10 minutes she's calling me, you know nagging me about something else oh you didn't so you forgot to do that, or you know you didn't talk that I, and you know, after this long, I know what i'm doing. He don't need her to help me every 10. yeah and it just got too much I just. I just couldn't go on."
252.0,Provider,Do you feel like she's singling you out.
4035.0,Patient,Absolutely yeah. She was like she's bullying me.
252.0,Provider,The have you put a complaint in with the human resources.
4035.0,Patient,"We don't have a human resources it's a pretty small company. But I did talk with the owner and he giggled and said yeah I realized she's got some work ahead of her she's not been a manager before, and she you know, has taken my word little little and i'll have to work on that. And that they. lasted."
252.0,Provider,And what you do.
4035.0,Patient,"When I went on, and call me doctor. Can. go in."
252.0,Provider,"And do you have. short term disability disability, that you can utilize in order to be able to get yourself some time away a little bit."
4035.0,Patient,"yeah I here's The saddest thing is I. went out in June and I no kidding i'm not kidding around anyway, I tempted by on June 5 to start to get a therapist and I finally am seeing new myself one. Lady that I saw years ago but she's through my health insurance, which is. guess it's called Palo Alto medical but they won't allow you to see a therapist more than five times so like I wasn't able to see her, she just saw me kind of out of the goodness of your heart. For you one appointment to see if I was gonna hurt myself but. So anyway i've been waiting all this time for someone to talk to you."
252.0,Provider,i'm so sorry this. system is broken.
4035.0,Patient,"Yes, it is, but you know, I think. i'm trying to understand at all, I think, with. code and everything else just everybody's behind in everything and I, and I get it, but damn it's difficult."
252.0,Provider,Well i'm glad you're here. glad you finally got here.
4035.0,Patient,i'm glad you're here.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so we have some work to do. Right. Yes, um so right now, you and I will meet every other week every two weeks and i'll give you little things to work on from week from time to time okay. Good and. The first thing that I want you to to look at is possibly, how can you get out of. This micromanaging situation, that is, you know driving you farther down. You have a primary care doctor."
4035.0,Patient,"Yes, she's the one that wrote me out. And so i've been out since June and i'm supposed to go back in November."
252.0,Provider,Oh okay so you've been out.
4035.0,Patient,yeah i've been out I just couldn't get any therapy and all that time.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, good good good um how is your. you're sleeping you're eating."
4035.0,Patient,"In your overeat. And i'm not sleeping very well I wake up again go to sleep, but I wake up all through the night."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, and what about any kind of exercise."
4035.0,Patient,"I walk but not, you know nothing to write home about I just take my dog for a walk and."
252.0,Provider,As we. Still exercise.
4035.0,Patient,yeah it's not like it's getting my heart rate up or anything but walking.
252.0,Provider,"that's okay that's exercise you're getting out you're walking walking the dog it doesn't matter okay that's still exercise so that's good. Okay, how much water, do you drink today."
4035.0,Patient,"Well varies but. I don't know not not a ton three four glasses of water, maybe five at most."
252.0,Provider,"that's pretty good. Okay, that is pretty good most people you know you're lucky if they drink, you know one bottle of wine, you know definitely man that's good. So you've already got the basics. Right you've already you know you're already exercising once a day, taking the dog out for a walk is exercise I don't care what anybody says. you're already drinking plenty of water. And one thing that we want to do is get your eating under control. Right so where you're not emotionally eating. And what that looks like is just you know how healthy do you eat."
4035.0,Patient,"Well, that again. I make decent healthy meals yeah but all around that aid all kinds of junk you know. When you call those nets with the food in, and you know anything chocolate in my mouth if it's in my house. jock potato chips which when i'm feeling good I noticed, I never eat that crap but. i've been in it for months now."
252.0,Provider,"We want to get you back to feeling good. And that's a piece of it and so really taking a look at the alternatives that you can replace in there, besides the junk food and i'm with you about the chocolate, can I tell you that. Right so and there's nothing wrong with chocolate every now and then. But right we have."
4035.0,Patient,One every time I pass the cabin.
252.0,Provider,"going to have a few I listen if it's in my house, all you to do. Do right, so you know what I do is i'll give myself permission once a week once every two weeks, when I go to the store to buy again word eat it. But I try not to have it in my house, because I know i'll eat it and. i'll go through. Go for it is that jumping and so changing that junk food to healthier foods like have ever tried that just six."
4035.0,Patient,Yes.
252.0,Provider,Those French Fries are there they're like.
4035.0,Patient,they're like a potato chip but they're squared and. Different colors.
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm so that's a different I mean it's not a healthy. right but it's a healthier alternative, so you want to find things that you could replace the junk food with that's healthier for you that you don't feel guilt for eating it. Right. right that goes with it to. You know, so you are already feeling bad we want it to not add any more of that to me. Okay okay and finding healthy alternatives that you like. And really making a commitment to you. that's, the most important thing and it's just saying you're not going on a strict diet you're not going to you know not eat but we're going to do is you're going to. start buying healthier food, so that when you do start emotionally eating it's healthier stuff then there's nothing to feel guilty about."
4035.0,Patient,Okay. you're not.
252.0,Provider,"Like nothing. And that's in moderation, you, you know, is not bad. I think some fruit, vegetables, you know definitely are better. Okay don't mean. A banana here and there, some apple slices with peanut butter, you know if you want to munch. Those are the types of the even a handful of groups, even though grapes are supposed to be like the worst fruit it's still better than tips. Okay right. People say you know well i'll just eat carrot carrot strobes a lot of people say, well, and then they buy them and leave them in the fridge so don't buy something you're not going to eat."
4035.0,Patient,Out of me yeah. But parents are very fatten right.
252.0,Provider,"don't care it's aren't in moderation, either. at all, but they're definitely a healthier alternative then. Something. You know."

4035.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,Once we get that that stuff out of it and you're on a more healthier eating habit you'll start to feel a little bit better. And then we can dive into the other stuff.
