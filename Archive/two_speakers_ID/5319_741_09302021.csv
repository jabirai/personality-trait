5319.0,Patient,I think it works better than any of the the. ridiculous segments. yeah.
741.0,Provider,"All right. yeah well as long as it olivia alleviates a lot of your issues, then that works. Okay. um. So what. Did you you. Did you do."

741.0,Provider,Okay. Did you ever use cocaine or mess.
5319.0,Patient,"mess I use pretty regularly just for the fact that it was often the only thing I could find. Okay, I wasn't something I particularly lights."

5319.0,Patient,"cocaine not. not really that awesome. Okay, just every every now and again every few months or so."

741.0,Provider,Okay it's been five years since you've been hospitalized for psychiatric issues. yeah all right and and. Have you ever attempted suicide.
5319.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,How many times.
5319.0,Patient,Just just one time well we're actually like was trying to do. Okay yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And, and you got have serious thoughts of suicide. Right now, do you. Know okay. All right, alright. Alright, so. What things do you want to work on. In treatment."
5319.0,Patient,Nothing really i'm gonna. Be i'm gonna be honest i'm trying to get out of this program because I think I I feel like i'm going backwards here I don't. feel like the level of tears appropriate I don't think i'm being treated like I just got clean and I don't understand why the program can adapt to where i'm at. So i'm actually i'm i'm going to be. i'll probably be gone within a couple weeks. Maybe like maybe like three at the most.
741.0,Provider,And are you looking for an independent physician to describe the suboxone for you or.
5319.0,Patient,um my on my last doctored referred me to paint paint specialist.
741.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. yeah that's probably your best bet because um this is medication assisted treatment, and so the idea is for you to have counseling along with the medication. You know, so the idea is to do relapse prevention and that kind of thing."
5319.0,Patient,"yeah and I can maybe see the benefit if I wasn't an engineering student, but the way the way it is right now only adding just one one more thing to my schedule just brings my stress level up."
741.0,Provider,"Right it's interfering with your education, and I can understand that. yeah you're focused on something in particular and that's awesome. I caution to you is that, when you accomplish that goal watch for. A let down. That could cause issues okay. So make sure that you have good support."
5319.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"that's I mean it's just a suggestion from my past experience okay so um. i'm not saying that it'll get you i'm not anything like that i'm just asking you be aware, you know and you've probably got at least two or three years of education to get through first. yeah but but be aware. and So. relapse prevention just make sure that you're watching your your behavior because relapse happens before we even actually move indeed so."
5319.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I mean you already know you've done it so. yeah that that thought process. Will will sneak up. So all right. i'm not going to keep you because I feel like. you've got other fish to FRY. yeah and I understand that education is very important, especially in engineering major i'm I admire him."
5319.0,Patient,Thank you.
741.0,Provider,I can handle that stuff.
5319.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
741.0,Provider,The chemistry cook.
5319.0,Patient,Oh well. you're doing what chemical engineering.
741.0,Provider,"and actually no I was just trying to get in the engineering school. Oh period. and industry minute. yeah I tried. I don't know how many times to get to chemistry I got to the first semester fine, it was a second semester, that I don't know my brain doesn't work that way or something."
5319.0,Patient,When they when they start getting into the more mathematical type stuff.
741.0,Provider,"Right and the math and that that's where my my weaknesses is really the mass. My brain just doesn't work like that. yeah I tried I got tutors I don't know how many times, I took trade. It was just I just i'm not cut that way. yeah I finally gave him to the. To the reality that i'm not a math major and i'm not a science major I love biology. um but whoo and I could do anatomy and all of that stuff but chemistry got me. I finally gave up and said okay i'll do a sociology and social work in because those things like I can do. So. But anyways um. So."
5319.0,Patient,"yeah so should, I think we should still make make another appointment probably. Okay yeah."
741.0,Provider,"I don't have a problem with that, and it can only be 38 can be 30 minutes long and that's fine. Okay okay. Yes, just go to the vc. Virtual clinic and tell them you want to schedule an appointment for 30 minutes with me and you tell them what day and if i'm available they'll schedule it."
5319.0,Patient,"Okay, and. The vc vc."
741.0,Provider,Virtual clinic the place to come in.
5319.0,Patient,On that carrot carrot navigation virtual clinics. yeah okay.
741.0,Provider,They do all the scheduling.
