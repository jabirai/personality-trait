17666.0,Patient,"Yes, Harry nisha kelly's 05 2592 sorry."
498.0,Provider,"For that mescaline. Thank you. Thank you for joining me today, my name is Dominique and one of this prescribers who you are. And i'm one of our prescribers here with bright heart health and i'm just going to go over some of the information that you provided on your new patient form should take us a few minutes i'd like to share some of that in your own words okay. tongue, if you. feel like you, are experiencing any difficulty with regard to. focus attention and concentration."
17666.0,Patient,"um yeah yeah I am I actually literally like this past weekend I finished taking like the l set but I for like the past few months, I was like studying for like the all set. But I have like ADHD but, like, I have, I have a hard time like finding the right like. dose and at first, I was taking like I don't know but I wasn't really taking every day because it wouldn't like make me have anxiety. So I really honestly just started taking is needed and it kind of just kind of stopped taking it because I, there will be a few times, where I would take it, and I would literally end up like. texting a crisis line because I would start freaking out I already have really bad anxiety and so I told the prescriber he changed it to riddle in which I. tried, when I was younger, but I think that those in making me go to sleep, because he started off at like five milligrams. And i'm supposed to go back to how and change those and I kind of just was like you know i'll just. Have a little coffee in the you know the beginning of the day, but I do think that I it's just how you metabolize things because even coffee I can't have much of it, so I think it has to do just kind of like how I metabolize them it type thing. Because I I don't even have more than like a half cup of coffee, so if it was tough but yeah sorry I went on a little tangent but yeah."
498.0,Provider,"No problem and tell me, and this is kind of a follow up question have you ever. Have you ever filed a medication, that was a non stimulant but that had some stimulant of sex in order to assist with focus attention and concentration."
17666.0,Patient,"yeah I want I actually maybe like twice tried wellbutrin for maybe like a month or two, I think, like maybe like over. I think I tried it like over like a like a spread a few years, like, I tried it once like for a few months, and then tried it again I. The good thing about the reason why I even tried it again because I didn't feel like there was any like insane side effects, but I also didn't think it was like working. And so I kind of didn't continue it yeah I do think I probably could benefit from you know, trying to live again, but maybe like instead of five maybe 10 milligrams because I literally would fall asleep so and and I can fall asleep I take that all so."
498.0,Provider,um any other. acute or historical issues like difficulty with appetite or sadness that appears to interfere with your ability to function.
17666.0,Patient,"And sometimes sometimes especially like over the past few months i've noticed. Like maybe like two months ago, I noticed that I was feeling so overwhelmed that like I would barely like. Okay, good so along with, like all my studying, I would like barely come out of the room and then, when I noticed one of my friends. And it would be like four o'clock and she like what have you had like lunch and I one day I was walking out, I was walking out of the door and I looked in the mirror. And I noticed that, like, I was getting like so skinny because I was literally like so focused on like like. You know, on my studies, I forgot, so I made it I basically like force myself to remember to like eat I also noticed I kind of did it yesterday, but I ended up just like eating a lot toward later yesterday. But typically if if I don't have like a lot of stressors I typically honestly like eat all day, so I usually don't have like. an actual appetite probably unless i'm like overwhelmed that I think it's more like out of like being preoccupied with what i'm doing rather than like not having enough if that makes sense, but if I have I don't have an appetite so yeah."
498.0,Provider,Any thoughts about harming yourself.
17666.0,Patient,i'm not currently no.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, what about historically."
17666.0,Patient,"Historically, yes I have. Had thoughts, but and also this year was like really tough like this past year is tough. But I don't think I like I got overwhelmed but I don't think a like truly like thought about it, I think it was just like really like fully mobile."
498.0,Provider,And it was there any consideration of methodology.
17666.0,Patient,"Well, sometimes, but I think like. few months ago, and I was like really stressed, I sometimes I would think like. Like. I don't know like sometimes it wasn't really like a plan, but I don't know I guess like when I would think about it, I think it was like. Like just kind of like maybe like involve my car, but I don't know I didn't really think about it too much, but when I was younger I had like a little bit of like an. episode. When I tried to hurt myself, but after, then I haven't seriously like thought out a plan, but whenever I. Whenever I get down, I guess, like, I never know like what I would like like how I would do that, but I think that, like when I thought about it. I guess it probably would like involve my car, but I don't really like think about it, I just kind of like prey on when that happened, so I don't try to like entertain the idea, but I do I get really, really overwhelmed. You know."
498.0,Provider,Thank you Shannon and tell me. Have you ever been hospitalized for mental health ever.
17666.0,Patient,"know no um no i've never been hospitalized for mental health, I know one time, like when I was younger talking about all those on one time I ever tried but. What time when I was younger I end up like drinking like pine oil and I got really, really sick if I was like 13 or 14 and I would, I have to go to the emergency room because it it really like burned my throat and I had I told my mom and my stuff that I was like like a mistake. They knew what they just had to get me to like the er and the er asked me questions, but I was hospitalized my mom say you just have to you just have to like get out here, so they can like take care of you, but you. have to be smart, and so I didn't tell them that I was purposely trying to hurt myself, but I think that they probably thought, but they didn't like keep me or anything they just. Like treated me, so I believe I say yeah."
498.0,Provider,Thank you for sharing that it's a little difficult. Any history of any. Any phobias.
17666.0,Patient,"um I think I might be a little bit of a journey. I think I think i'm definitely actually a little bit of a German and if it's something that even like became more high I mean I was a German before. charger up, I was already a journal before covert, but I think like after then it's like I can't. Like when I go even if I like go outside of like me to post mates person or something like because i've gone outside and like if I take my phone and I have to like completely clean my phone. Obviously, like i'm going to wash my hands, every time I come in, but like I I can't I have to do it was like out fail so and then like. I do think like i'm like a general code for sure it does make it was heightened by code, but I always think that I was like. super jealous a little bit like yeah or like particular. yeah."
498.0,Provider,Any any history of any eating disorders bulimia anorexia anything at all.
17666.0,Patient,"Not not really like the. Notable history of eating disorder i'm not really I would say, like anytime or problem or eating wasn't probably like purposeful it's probably just like relating to like something like that I was like going through or something, but I don't think I have a purposely not. Like like bandaged are are not being so, I think it's fine. I think there was like a moment, where I was probably like obsessed with like being a little bit lighter I remember taking like I mean i've always been like pretty thin, but I think like I remember from like ninth grade feeling good girl was like even when I went back like I have. And was probably shouldn't have but I remember taking like green tea tablets to like but I don't think it was like an obsession with like really I think it was just kind of like being a teenager was trying to. Look over something like that um but yeah so to answer your question I don't think I had like a like an actual user."
498.0,Provider,"mentioned, and you mentioned anxiety earlier. With regard to being exacerbated and. You know post federal administration. yeah tell me how often you feel like you encounter anxiety is it something that occurred daily which we should all as a general a."
17666.0,Patient,"um it's like daily and it's like super often like I ended up kind of canceling my trip home for like Christmas, because I had so much to do and I because I recently took that exam I was like i'll go afterwards. And then i'm just going to give you like a few examples that I like freak out like my. For example, like my sister's birthday, is this weekend and. She like wanted me to come in for her birthday, and I was just like freaking out like I have. You know, like I have so much to do with my applications and things like that, but then I felt bad because you know I had some you know my birthday, with her last year in Georgia and so. i'm from Louisiana, by the way, but it's so I was just starting to like feel bad and it was kind of like the same situation like when I didn't go home, it was like. My heart wants to go, but like I know that I had, like other priorities i'm going to after I end up sleeping on it i'm going to end up going i'm just going to try to like make it worth. Because I felt like I feel like my sister with like you know she would come. So i'm going to end up going, but I just really like overwhelmed me and I barely started crying started like pulling up my clothes. Even though I hadn't fully decided that I was going, but I had to like actually go through the motions to like get myself ready to like even like push myself to go. And so I called my sister, and I was like I was like literally This is like my younger sister but she's like always been like. She was like I think that you kind of like need to like think of things like one by one, and I was just like I wasn't planning on like spinning it, she was like well, you can do like your own toes and you can do all of this, like I just need like so. So even like through text like before you even like before I called her on the phone, even though it's like do tax, you will say like. I really want to have you there for my birthday would be perfect on but she was like what I understand and I like be printing but it's like I know that she wants me to go, you know. And so, and when I talked to her over the phone it wasn't like it wasn't like she like reserved to same like stay like don't stay home she's saying like. like this you're making it to a bigger problem has she definitely wants me to she wants me to come so that's why I kind of like felt bad so. I kind of like I mentally prepared myself for just like say i'm coming but I another reason why I felt that is because. Originally, I supposed to go home for Christmas and I literally had to like cancel my flight and I got a credit and the credit that I would be using to go. see her it was the credit that is going to be using to go home and I really wanted to see my grandma but now I feel bad because. I don't know whether it was not this way, but I just didn't want her to feel like why you know, obviously, both of our. Both of us are like her granddaughter that whenever we get together we call her on the phone so i'm not going to like pretend like I didn't go down there, but I just felt bad because. I pushed back going on for Christmas and said that I would come back after I take my exam but now i'm like going there so it's another easy way for that. But I think like once I talked to my grandma, then I think I probably will so bad because she just she not gonna make me feel bad, but I just kind of like feel that cuz. I don't get too serious. Because I live over here sorry. Sorry i'm like going like on a whole story, but. So yeah so that's what I meant like I just kind of like freak out and, like everything is kind of like spirals and that. And that kind of happens like multiple times a day so that's."
498.0,Provider,The fun. If you experience any panic attack.
17666.0,Patient,um yes i've experienced panic attacks.

498.0,Provider,How did you resolve them resolvable.
17666.0,Patient,"I just. Well, I just like pulled over like in a parking lot and I just kind of like. First. One is I had like this, like meditation APP so I remember turning that on in my car and then I also called my grandma and. So I usually just kind of like here until it by like doing like. I either will listen to like. A specific sound or our listen to a meditation or I honestly will end up like calling someone like close to me. Because I think sometimes like if I start talking about it and start talking about something else, and I can like it'll like take my mind off of it or something."
498.0,Provider,Have you ever having surgery.
17666.0,Patient,"And i've had direct surgery on in 2008 they lose half of my thyroid because i'd like a massive it was like 6.7 centimeters it became 6.7 centimeters. Now, Joe but I had originally found that like years ago, maybe like 2000 like 13 or something we found it on the scan. And it was super small like like half a centimeter, and so they just told me let We just have to like get a few biopsies or they. Do it sounds like on a yearly and then eventually it just grew and they were like okay like we actually have to like remove this and it was like also like attached to my like my local court so. It was a whole thing, but so yeah sorry that's the. surgery and try to stick to the question. yeah sure you."

17666.0,Patient,"I don't believe so. lost consciousness i'm actually actually I fainted before, but I think. I don't know yeah I fainted at once, and it was because I wasn't like eating, but it wasn't like I was purposely eating, this was like my first month here and like. yeah kind of poor but yeah so I don't think i've lost consciousness like just out of like kind of state. I think, maybe No, sorry."
498.0,Provider,"um. What about any trauma, would you characterize. Any other situations that you've experienced this as traumatic."
17666.0,Patient,"um I think. Well, I think it probably would be important to like mentioned that so um what grandma raise me and my siblings because our mom was like a way for like eight years. in Florida. Because of like like fraud or something so and she was like a way I was born in 1992 and for she was away from 1995 to 2003 so like for eight years. And that's also like my sister was born in 1996 so she couldn't do that, basically, like she just came home to us, so I feel like that caused a lot of like resentment in like like like family like area. So yeah so there's like that. And then my brother went to the army and then like he kind of came back and was like never like the same and we were like literally like the best friends like my brothers like I think like 14 months like older than me. So you're like always like really close to my like play video games and like do like doors and stuff, but when he came back like it was literally like like something you see on TV like he can barely walk past you, and it would be like it's a ghost. But it was really extreme to the point that, like. One time he had bought like his own personal goes after like he was like this chart and he, like. Like shot into the roof, and my we had to like how the please come because he did wasn't like in the right mind, and so we have to get to where he can have like. Like weapons, but if i'm really sad because I remember, I went to go and see him like think they put in, like in a hospital and I felt really bad like. Because I didn't want him to think that, like i'm like I guess like that we were like picking on him or like to like I always say no, so it was me and my grandma. But I don't think he thought that, but apparently he, like had like wrote an entire notebook about like my mom being like the worst and like. it's good to say. Because because it wasn't like. Alright, this is like getting off topic super quiet um. yeah I hope I answered your question because I honestly can't even really remember it but um I guess. yeah so. that's that I guess it's like. Where other people transcend like mine, specifically, but I think i've always taken on like like other people like in a case like that."
498.0,Provider,"and Are you aware of any on. Any medical history, you mentioned that I was going with regard to yourself. Anything yeah else that you're aware of that this would include your medical history your mother's side of the family and all your father started looking at all, it could be attention, diabetes, cancer anything."
17666.0,Patient,"um I honestly best besides the direct the direct is like been the biggest thing I guess the thing I go like nearly four I would go anyways but it's like really like my only like i'm Dave like saying and thankfully I don't want to take, like any like direct supplements but. I think my family not really like diabetes, but they have like high blood pressure, you know my grandma and my some of my family, they have high blood pressure and. Think of like other. Like arthritis when friends. And then."
498.0,Provider,liver and kidney disease respiratory disease asthma mental health.
17666.0,Patient,"Oh yes, yes, yes, asthma yeah my brother has asthma and I think my mom has asthma I don't have any asthma don't have as much but. And then my mom or my brother supposed to have ptsd or who they said that he was like schizophrenia, and then apparently like my mom was like very too so. yeah so that's like a big issue, and I think i'm a little bit of a spouse, too, but I don't think it's I think i'm more I think i'm just like super hyper like aware and. So yeah I think like with them it's probably like a little bit less of a regard for like surroundings and like people, but I think i'm I probably. would make sense. But I haven't like not. Officially, like running anything because I don't think I like. I don't really like trying to lose it all people, I think I just kind of like get a chest and. yeah i'm."
498.0,Provider,Are you.
17666.0,Patient,"i'm not currently but I was entering relationship i'm pretty long relationship until like. January 2019. But we're still we're still like really good friends, just because I guess. For me, we spent the most time with each other so and also he's like aware of me like freaking out like. Like even yesterday, when I was freaking out about if I should like go to my sister like I ended up like just call him because I was like freaking out, and I think it's just because, like. he's like. I don't know, I think, because, like I know it's like he was just like I think I don't know it's just kind of like I guess like. I don't know so yeah so i'm not like dating right now, and I was planning to like maybe like date after my exam but I kept like just like pushing it off like this one person that went on a date with like right before I like the lockdown like maybe like two years ago. This would have been like at this point, this would have been like so I broke up with my ex in January 2019 so this would have been like the end of end of 2019 so like maybe I think like September or something we went on like one day. And he was like studying for his masters and then I remember him saying like maybe we should get together after like I finished my studies i'm not sure if I would be like. The best, and I was, like every time because I wasn't like super like either I wasn't it, it was like I didn't mind whatever way to go and wasn't like super focused on it and then. like this year I can like may I ended up graduating with masters and then I started studying for my outside and he was like reach out to me i'd be like Oh, we have to like get together after I finished like study for my exam and so. Basically I just kept like like pushing them back because I that's all I could like it's odd and i'm but yeah so we're friends and might eventually go on another day but yeah so. Sorry, I just."
498.0,Provider,know now.

498.0,Provider,Do you. consume any CBD products any any nicotine.
17666.0,Patient,"No i've never consuming the nicotine i've actually never like smoking or anything like that, but recently. This past year I first tried like CBD like this, like the regular CBD. But like I basically like it sometimes I have a hard time with like sleeping like a baby for two days ago. Yesterday I end up staying up until like three or 4am and I was craziest I had like clippers tickets like which I wasn't super interested in going to the super last minute. But they were like front row and I told myself I go to sleep like I can go and one of my friends, thankfully, I don't think it was meant to be. Because my friend and that messaging me saying you know her grandpa's like partner with likely. Like not going to make it so she was a person that I was going to go with and I was really tired, so the kind of like worked out really well but. You know that I ended up going, because I was just really tired, but I recently started trying with the CBD he does have a little bit of thc CBD in so Simeon currently supposed to be like. More like I guess like it makes you go to sleep and so usually. Like once it's got like, for example, before I take my exam in order to like go to sleep, what I would do because I wanted to go to sleep by 1130 then around like 10 or 1030, then I would take it so that way at least you sleep around 1130 or 12 the latest. Because I just wanted to make sure that I like I woke up like on time, like so that was like really well woke up what time to talk about the actual street because. I wouldn't be able to like perform if I didn't get to sleep, but I basically have to like force myself to sleep so. The answer that question like yeah I try CBD of equilibrium, so I took a bunch of like hipster stuff but I don't actually like smoke or. Like do like any like actually I don't do any drugs, but this is just like CBD but this one is just like pure CBD and as a CBD fail CAP, but I also have like. Maybe it's like 20 to one ratio or CBD and they're also is like, I guess, a small one ratio of thc and CBD and also is like a similar ratio um but yeah. So then it's more just like for like sleep because. i've taken melatonin and will be like up. So."
498.0,Provider,yeah they thing.
17666.0,Patient,Or you know.
498.0,Provider,What about an assumption.
17666.0,Patient,I rarely drink. I have rarely drink.
498.0,Provider,"Anything anything else, like psychedelics or mushrooms or."
17666.0,Patient,"No i've actually no I don't. I say no, now I am i've actually never tried anything like literally. me trying. CBD like for the CBD is so bad for me tried like even like the smaller issues with like thc that was like the biggest leap that i've made because. Like even now, today, like all of my friends like no I don't even like smoke like one of. Like even my son my younger sister like she smoke so she comes out here like she wants to go to like a dispensary and i'm like. i'm just here for like moral support, but I literally like won't do like a showroom I won't do like any type of like recreational like I will nurse or drink with a hat I gotta drink for like. A whole entire night like so I I don't i've never tried to me like much room where it's like any like type of like like pills are like none of that like no type of like party drugs I just kind of like just I think i'm like come naturally. kind of goofy so I just do my thing. But yeah no I don't do any baking i've never smoked a cigarette smoking weed the thc is a it's basically like the course farthest i've gone. and low doses so. See."
498.0,Provider,any chance at all that you could be pregnant.
17666.0,Patient,know.
498.0,Provider,What was your last menstrual period.
17666.0,Patient,"It was like maybe like three like three weeks ago, two weeks. I would say, maybe like two weeks ago well okay I purposely you know how you supposed to like take a break for like. From like your birth control, because I knew I was going to have my exam I didn't want it to happen because I didn't want to be distracted so basically like purposely kind of made myself like skip it and so that way it wouldn't interfere with my exam because sometimes like. If your back is hurting you can't like focus and yeah so sorry like that's like super random but. I guess a tip here every day should."
498.0,Provider,You have any allergies and the elegance to medication.
17666.0,Patient,"i'm not allergic to any medication i'm not allergies to some food, but I don't think but I don't think it's a really bad because it's like foods that I was like already eating before I really found out that I was allergic. Common and it sounds silly but the reason. I say that is because they get like food some regularly like exposed to, and the allergy say that they're very mild, but I have, for example, I have a shrimp allergy. mile trip biology. And my brother can't eat shrimp at all like it's like little little like blow up i've been edition for like years and i've never had that happen to not go with but. You know before I even found out that I was allergic I remember like having a little bit of a scratchy throat, but it wasn't anything like it wasn't like anything like super noticeable. And then I didn't really kind of like put it together until afterwards. But like I even have so many times like never like you know i'm never a new thinking about oh my God i'm going to have like we're going to just like go into like having like an allergic reaction to seeing the reaction. But I probably should be like helpful, so the things that I supposed to be aware, to try not to like it all the time because apparently I think the more that you like. expose yourself to hours and they can become a little bit more aggressive, but I think it was just such like a slight allergy that I don't really have access to sorry. going off on a."
498.0,Provider,medication that you take on a daily basis.
17666.0,Patient,"i'm like tylenol and advil I don't really take it easy on a daily basis. yeah sometimes like, though, like take like iron here and there."
498.0,Provider,Our next question any vitamins or supplements.
17666.0,Patient,"yeah sometimes I take I. was always supposed to take it for like two weeks, but sometimes like if I haven't been like eating wall there now like. I guess i'll conclude like that, like maybe I need to take it so sometimes I go do that I have with vitamins like in my kitchen that i'll take like I was like vitamin C. I have like some just like different like vitamins, but I think yeah so I don't really take."
498.0,Provider,regularly. yeah.

498.0,Provider,Over eating or drinking in explicable fluctuations and wait.
17666.0,Patient,"um I think like maybe like two months ago I have like this dropping away, I think I ended up like corn from length like 109 to like one or two and I noticed and I basically just way which. has been that small in like yours, thankfully, like i've been measuring myself I think i'm like 106 point something so as soon as soon as I noticed that are basically.
