14575.0,Patient,"Okay, I."
498.0,Provider,"don't want that anxiety to be overwhelming for you, is it will come, but it needs to be at a level that's manageable just so that it doesn't exacerbate your moodle."
14575.0,Patient,"And i've been able to keep myself in bed under the covers and and just work through the thoughts. And you know not not been dragging myself out of bed at 530 in the morning, just because i'm wide awake and just try to relax and. Then embrace the day."
498.0,Provider,"Good very good very, very good to hear. How is how, how are you with regard to anxiety any panic attack."
14575.0,Patient,"No panic attacks I. I related to my therapist i'm and i'm sorry her name escapes me right now but. I had an incident with um. And I guess it kind of was a panic attack, I was buying some. wiper fluid from my car and they had a special on to for $8 and and I had walked up to the calendar to the counter with the cheap stuff. And I couldn't make a decision, and even though there was nobody behind me I got. very, very flustered and wound up making a silly choice I only bought one and one that paying two over $2 extra and I got in the car and because my dog was with me, I did not hit myself, but I wanted to slap myself so hard. And i'm just because. It was such a simple thing and I couldn't work it out. And you know and. i'm gonna will you, excuse me, when I look at my therapist name because that's bugging me. It is amanda. Okay, so and and amanda pointed out to me that, even after the transaction had been completed after I was in the car I could have gone back in and and redone it to the point where I got the good deal on the wiper fluid um, but it was just an all of a sudden. Like my my brain froze up and I couldn't make a decision. And that upset me and that led to the panic and that led to the self loathing and so now i've been working on my daily affirmation. When she is I marry treat myself kindly. And so I write that 10 times morning and evening every day. and I was grappling a little bit yesterday with the idea. So. you're familiar with Tom petty and the heartbreakers so there's a song even the losers get lucky sometimes and I shared that yesterday, and I said I am counting on this. And so that, of course, implies that I think of myself as a loser, and I ruminated over this all day yesterday because it's a relative term. And Tom petty himself we're certainly known loser can mean he lived his dream, he never did anything but playing rock and roll he didn't bust tables he didn't work in a movie thing and there, he was genuine and even when he wrote that song he might have felt like a loser, but he wasn't."
498.0,Provider,that's right.
14575.0,Patient,"He wasn't he was a gifted brilliant musician, and so we have to be careful when we label ourselves and I found out about this all day yesterday because so here I am 60 years old, and I have nothing to show for my life and my. Until I turned 55 my primary goal, you know and go to work every day, just so I could come home and have that glass of wine or in my earlier days, just so I could go out and party with the game. My whole life feels so wasted, but then I have to look at the people that never find their way out. And i'm not a loser if I found my way out of that."
498.0,Provider,"No, you know."
14575.0,Patient,I win that's right.
498.0,Provider,"Every day, every day, that you get up. You go after it again, you do. Good good for you misread very good for you. So it sounds like you and amanda have established a good rapport with beer."
14575.0,Patient,"Very much so, yes."
498.0,Provider,Very good i'll continue to follow along along with amanda for your progress any. Any thoughts about harming yourself.
14575.0,Patient,"Not since that day. It the auto parts store. Oh um i've had some episodes of agitation I described to amanda I had a bad week last week my sister admitted admitted herself for mental health Karen I was very worried about her and that's why I missed our appointment that was just so distracted so. amanda recommended a therapy to me were you immerse your face and ice cold water. And this was in response to an episode that I had where I got so angry. I chased a dog in the ice and snow in my sweats I ran down the stairs in my apartment and ran out there and chased him because he was eating the bird seed that I put out from my birds. And I chased him to a snow burn any coward and that's when I that's when I came out of it. and I was so sick with myself i'm an animal lover and I worked in rescue for 11 months before I burned down but um I was just appalling with myself and. And one of my good friends gave me the excellent advice of if you feel so badly about it grab some dog biscuits in your pocket walk down to where you encountered the dog and make it up to him and that's what I did, and he was see it's not his fault his parents, let him run loose. And so I did I found him and I gave him a handful of dog biscuits and he was happy as could be and. And so, she decided when I related that to amanda she said that something called. Action full positivity."
498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14575.0,Patient,"And so i'm i'm trying to do that I had another period of agitation yesterday and really trying to keep it in in control with my negative thoughts and when when something doesn't go right like the cat that's been destroying my porch. um I did a little bit better yesterday morning and and I am I thought about immersing my face and cold water, but the idea of it was enough to kind of calm me down. and actually going through with that their thing but. In retrospect, maybe I should have done it because. I did throw a few things around and. Maybe and. I don't know I don't know if it's an appropriate that I I turned all of my patio furniture upside down to keep the cat from he's trying to get into my windows and window fight with my cats and it's a problem and his own his owners won't keep him in."
498.0,Provider,So that's establishing. A boundary.
14575.0,Patient,"So, to prevent it from happening again, I felt like it was the proactive stuff. Correct until he may be decides that that's no fun anymore, if he can't get to the window and he and he stops this behavior."
498.0,Provider,"So, good for you for."
14575.0,Patient,Trying to. work through the anger. Rather than just react.
498.0,Provider,"Absolutely absolutely I can, I think it's worth recognizing the work that you're doing it's not an overnight overnight resolve but you're actively engaged in the in the prevention of it so good for you okay."
14575.0,Patient,"So that's kind of where i've been and then. Throughout all of it, trying to keep perspective, like like with the loser thing i'm not homeless on skid row, am I. You know it's relative and so um I always try to keep perspective, like that I have a safe home. And that's something and then a lot of people don't have."
498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14575.0,Patient,So i'm thankful and grateful every day I try to keep the gratitude and the perspective and all times.
