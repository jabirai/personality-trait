759.0,Provider,Events okay.
15703.0,Patient,So um. yeah that I don't know but I guess that's it really.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, you want to talk about a particular situation that was particularly hard for you to to on go through our process through."
15703.0,Patient,"um. I don't have anything specific it's it's kind of you know, like i'm all over the place, to be honest with you it's whether i'm you know thinking about past tense things are things that are happening present you know in my present. You know I got my father he's he's ill, he has. prostate cancer that's like you know metastatic so it's like i'm dealing with his health and. there's a lot of stuff you know and it's just i'm I don't really i'm trying to find a way to manage it so that it doesn't seep into my life but it's nothing I can do to really prevent that from happening, you know. um. So I guess i'm just agitated with my own self licious with my responsibilities to to to an extent, like i'm tired of. Dealing with it all, you know. My anxiety up, and you know just makes me worry about things a little bit more."
759.0,Provider,"So there's a lot to you know it's a lot, you know kind of take care of yourself take care of your patients take care of your father, you know it's like you said there's a lot of responsibilities that you do have."

759.0,Provider,"yeah are you taking time out for yourself, these days, you know for self care."
15703.0,Patient,"I mean, I have the weekend, you know weekends off, but I but i'm not doing, I mean, but I find myself just kind of like lying around and i'm like is that even you know self care. So I guess not really I guess not i'm not i'm not taking that time. You know any. intention, no decision to like take time out for myself now."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, I think it starts a little bit with dad you know, like intentionally like you said, taking some time for yourself. You know, giving yourself some you know time in in order to do something that's particularly something that you want to do. As part of your self care regimen I think having like a normal self care regimen to help you with distress of your daily you know by work, you know, I think that will go a long way to. You know something that you can do every single day that doesn't practice to you know, taking care of yourself. because sometimes you know we take care of our physical health needs every day like eating showering or you know just like simple things like that, but sometimes we forget to take care of our mental health."
15703.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"you'd be you know also you know just doing little things here and there, for ourselves, or just paying attention and checking in with ourselves and seeing how we're feeling, you know, being in tune with our emotions."
15703.0,Patient,got it yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah which i'm sure this is all stuff that you know i'm just a big reminder.
15703.0,Patient,"I mean you know, but you know because I don't even though i'm a advocate you know I don't advocate for myself enough, you know I advocate for others and that's just kind of what i've been trained to do."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15703.0,Patient,"um but for some reason I just kind of put them i've been putting myself on the back burner, and I guess it's just been going on for too long, and so things are surfacing now."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15703.0,Patient,yeah that's that's about it.
759.0,Provider,"yeah okay let's think of kind of something that you can do every single day for yourself like what are some of the things that you, naturally, you know, like to do but kind of been putting off to the side."
15703.0,Patient,"Now I will walk since going to the beach and things like that, I mean i'm an outdoors."
759.0,Provider,outdoors person okay.
15703.0,Patient,"I used to read, but you know and i'm in but i've like i've been studying so i'm not really getting into my books as much as I used to i'm just kind of doing my study thing."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15703.0,Patient,So I guess really just. I can't forgot what I like to do natural.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15703.0,Patient,"Sad, I guess, when people say your hobbies i'm like I don't really have any hobbies anymore you think."
759.0,Provider,"You can think of. yeah you know, like yourself, can you look at like different things like it's some for some people, is going to the gym you know for some people's taking a hike. You know, like something that they do well, you can take a hike was I guess you could every day, but something that is something that is doable to do every single day, you know look or even four or five times from out of the week, you know just something that. It can be as simple as i'm going to take a nice hot shower and listen to some music do is i'm going to de stress by you know, like aroma therapy. You know, it could be something just as simple as that. You know, like i'm putting this as an intentional practice the idea to stress from the day, it could be something like checking them with friends, you know engaging you know with. A friend or partner, you know, are doing something on the outside, you know catching up with someone it could be. gotcha yeah so. You know I want you in the next coming weeks, think of you know, like what you can do to kind of like put you know into practice, some things you know, like Let me give you some more ideas like some people like to. Begin coloring books like adult coloring bugs they like to you, like you said read, can you know you can start to read the book and let's you know, listen to music read a book, you know read some incense like some candles you know just stuff like. That you know cuz I want you to start to think about what you would like to put into practice, that you can do each day. Okay yeah."
15703.0,Patient,I can do that. yeah i'll start doing it.
759.0,Provider,"yeah start small I don't give you to me my ideas, but just you know something small that you can do, even though it might seem small has big reward. You know how you feeling I want you to check in with yourself emotionally each and every single day, because I think that's important to like. Even to do like a mood tracker you know just kind of like I feel sad today, I feel anxious today, I feel you know anger to their frustration, today, you know, so if you can start to do that, then you can do it on your phone you know just with the notes, you know. Like I have an iPhone or notes or you can just go from day to day like Monday December 12 I felt our I feel you know lonely or whatever emotion that it might be. And we can talk about it in therapy. Okay, like yeah I want you to to tap into yourself a little bit, because it seems like you're a little detach you know from yourself. yeah yeah. tune back in to to you and kind of like your sense of purpose, because you're helping a lot of people you're you know, like dare for a lot of people sounds like and then sometimes your it sounds like you're a little forgetful of yourself. yeah."
15703.0,Patient,"Okay, I can do that."
759.0,Provider,Good.
15703.0,Patient,i'll try it.
759.0,Provider,"yeah give it a try doesn't have to be you know, like elaborate like I said, you know just it could just be something spending like five minutes you know doing that you know, like yeah."
15703.0,Patient,Okay. yeah i've been doing glad every day.
759.0,Provider,Oh dad. Wonderful into men too. Right. yeah gadget you one thing have to learn and accomplishment and delight.
15703.0,Patient,yeah doing that so trying to make it more of a kind of a routine.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm. Okay.
15703.0,Patient,"yeah so i'll definitely try those those other techniques that you suggested. I guess I wasn't looking at small things as being a you know big reward in terms of you know, like just my self care. But i'll definitely make a list of things to try to you know figure out what it what small things that doing joy. That I can make. More persistent. yeah. i'll try."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good good yeah I want you to try it then and see how you feel and to the next time we talk. yeah yeah anything else, been coming up for you lately."
15703.0,Patient,"um, no, no, I just i've just been you know more excited about my rest, because I do feel better."
759.0,Provider,"Read part of self care to you know, like intentionally sometimes just unplugging from like the world around us and, just like resting and you know were you, the one that said that you've been resting lately. yeah then yeah that she had that rest yeah yeah."
15703.0,Patient,"So that's that's been it's it's been actually pretty cool because I was struggling with sleep. For about 90 days I guess. I will get. So it was it was causing a lot of. Physical issues, I think. So I do feel that different so i'm just hoping, you know I won't feel as down, as I do. In the long you know, in the future, and if."
759.0,Provider,you're right yeah. Okay.
15703.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean I can't really think of anything else that you know I. haven't you know, been to snappy at with anyone I just feel the agitation within so i've just been trying to remove myself when I do feel that way. at work it's a little harder. But I definitely you know I don't exude it out on my co workers or anything like that, but it's it's been challenging."
759.0,Provider,it's been challenging. yeah yeah.

15703.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's just triggers you know it's like i've you know i've i've always kind of dealt with loss but um and I think I got desensitized at some point, but then as i've gotten older i've gotten a little bit more emotional towards it. um, I think, just because, like how i'm aging and just everyone around these aging, you know. I don't know it's just more disturbing I guess."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15703.0,Patient,"yeah but. I don't know I mean I know it's part of life, so I just have to kind of deal with a navigate through."
759.0,Provider,"yeah and it's okay to kind of miss people you know, like. Especially during this time, and just to say like I missed that person. is like in just a sub dad you know you know, like he missed them and that you wish that there were here with you. Right yeah."
15703.0,Patient,that's it for me. there's nothing I can change with that it's just a matter of trying to cope.
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you know definitely trying to co you know allow yourself to just leave their their loss, and you know, and you know, hopefully be able to remember them by doing things that they like to do things that maybe you like to do with them. You know kind of like the same type of like. Their fear the live. So to say you know and just the. right time, and I think that's okay. yeah. it's hard when you lose people that you loved and we're one there, and especially during these called the times but they're still around."
