505.0,Provider,Steven hi it's great to see you.
14989.0,Patient,good to see you too.
505.0,Provider,Well i'm glad you're here.
14989.0,Patient,yeah it's been a kind of a journey for me i'm i've been trying to get. Connected with reinhardt. Providing about the last week week and a half and submitted all of my paperwork and and did everything and they we had some trouble where they weren't sure if my insurance was going to cover this or that and finally got past that because. Right now i've been in a program here in Ohio it's called bright view. And they they actually. prescribe the same medications and things that you do i've been in the program for over a year now. And it's absolutely wonderful it's a. I just can't understand why more people are doing that.
505.0,Provider,"Steve. Tell me, why are you leaving bright view."
14989.0,Patient,"Because I well I heard of your program and I live in the rural area in southeastern Ohio and in the winners, I am i'm disabled and. In the winners and traveling it's it's hard on me, you know because of the snow and the icing and going to and from, so I think this may work real well for me. In that sense."
505.0,Provider,"Well we're thrilled that you're here and you're right this program is all online, so you know it is such a blessing to so many people. would not have a treatment."
14989.0,Patient,"I didn't know it even existed, and when I found out, it was just so exciting and intriguing, even though I didn't even know how to use the little tablet that i'm talking to you on. it's still i'm learning and it gives me the incentive to to learn how to do this and to experience it yeah so it's going to be boarding, I think."
505.0,Provider,That helps other people Stephen every time you get better you show other people addiction is a treatable illness.
14989.0,Patient,"I have, I have three children I didn't have any children till I was 35 and i've just been blessed with my first grandson. Who wants to go and i'm hot at my house now visiting her and and the grandbaby and remington is his name so he's the family and. My my son Stephen he just graduated high school. Maybe, three months ago and, believe it or not, he has already moved into his new home. And he is out and he's really wow it's a he's something i'm I can't be more proud of Stephen he loves his job and and he's just 18 years old, and he already is buying his first home and. whoa it's it's great you know, and I encouraged him to do it, and he is really, really amazing man doing so well Eminence he's got a girlfriend and she's a she's going to college to be a nurse she's a nursing assistant now, and he works as a welder so they made."
505.0,Provider,A great job.
14989.0,Patient,yeah he makes good money is only 18 and they are. They both got good level heads on their shoulders and they're. Just taking the world by that.
505.0,Provider,"And so, Stephen let me um let's get down to business here cuz I want to be able to prescribe your medicine so i'm going to ask you a bunch of rapid fire questions. Please can you give me this short answer. So you and I will get to know each other. along the way, but I want to get you on your medicine. Right so i'm looking at pharmacy record and."
14989.0,Patient,"I just changed that to Donna, who georgetown Ohio."
505.0,Provider,"With a Stephen. As far as I can tell, maybe i'm on the wrong Stephen Parker and you have not been prescribed suboxone since December Is that correct."
14989.0,Patient,"No, no that's not correct, because the week that i've been trying to get into your program i've i've been in program up here so as of this morning and I just told the other lady just before I spoke with you. yeah that I went to my. Right you clinic up here this morning I got my vacation because it was do today and and I told her that we won't need to prescribing medication today because I already have it. I said I want to be truthful with everyone and let everybody know what you know, everybody else is doing, I surely want you to know as much as I can about. Because that's what makes this."
505.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly now but. Stephen i'm. I am confused here so um."
14989.0,Patient,what's.
505.0,Provider,"what's your date of birth is 930 65 correct. It is, and do you feel your medicines in Ohio or in a different state."
14989.0,Patient,"And Ohio but the last time that does suboxone was prescribed from Donna, who was back when you just said back in December, maybe because. that's when the program up here started dispensing the medication at the clinic they told me that I was not allowed to go to the pharmacy and pick up my medication them work, even though I asked him and told him that this is they legally is pain medication."
505.0,Provider,"But when you Stephen okay stop there, because i've got to get this straight on the recording this is gonna confuse people so for Stephen he was he stopped getting. His suboxone through donahue Donna, who pharmacy in December, and then the has remained on suboxone this medication is being dispensed by break view pharmacy and, therefore, is not captured by the Ohio pharmacy record. Perfect okay. All right, that is helpful and then Stephen it looks like your dose has been the tabs sub suboxone tabs and you've been on one two times a day correct."
14989.0,Patient,No i've been on. 22 milligrams. 20 milligrams once a day take it first thing in the morning and that's the only time I take it. I don't know how you want to prescribe your medication.
505.0,Provider,So. On. How many tabs to these take.
14989.0,Patient,"I take two eight milligram tablets and three two milligram tablets as up to 22 milligrams and I told him I didn't want to be on 24 milligrams that's the most you can get they said I said I don't want to be there, I said I just wake up in the middle of the night and. So they prescribe the others. They increase the dosage but and now it's been shoot it's been months and everything is leveled out and it's great as far as the man."
505.0,Provider,hey so you're on eight milligram tablets huge hate to it in the morning and then you're on to milligram tabs and you take two a day.
14989.0,Patient,Three of them a day. that's 22 milligrams total.
505.0,Provider,"bet it's very unusual dosing i'm In this sense, is that covered under your insurance."
14989.0,Patient,"It sure is it's been covered, for the last months and months, but the pharmacy they have a trouble with dispensing the two milligrams."
505.0,Provider,Exactly because they say.
14989.0,Patient,"Well, when I was going to Donna, who I had to break the tablet in half, you know and Evelyn and have to eat well what was prescribed to me and that's how me and Donna, who the pharmacy did that. I know it's confusing but it works. it'd be so much easier if I just had three eight milligram tablets a day. yeah now at the end of it so that's that's where i'm at I know i'm gonna and I was thinking about that yesterday. That sounds like to Donna, who then I don't know how they're going to dispense the the milligrams so we would have to change something."
505.0,Provider,"yeah um. Yes, so i'm Stephen what I would normally do is eight milligrams three a day, instead of this two milligrams stuff. Usually medicaid won't cover this kind of."
14989.0,Patient,dispensary. I have medicaid and medicare.
505.0,Provider,"So right Steve are you comfortable if I prescribe it at 24 milligrams today, I heard you say you're not too excited about that."
14989.0,Patient,"It was going to conflict about. See, I have a. I just when when I was going over it with my doctor and we were increasing the medication, I was saying that you know I don't want to be at the Max, but I want to be comfortable. Is she said well i'm not going to give you the Max dose which is 24 milligrams which would have been fine to me if she would have prescribed it that."
505.0,Provider,"Well okay. we're gonna move on i'm going to prescribe 24 milligrams a day, I think that this is going to be easier and. it's gonna allow the pharmacy. To get your your medicine, I am very concerned that you're going to get into trouble accessing two milligram tablets. And then you're you're not gonna have enough medicine and. it's just gonna be a mess for you."
14989.0,Patient,So understand.
505.0,Provider,"yeah let's do that um so going back to your your history, Stephen to use heroin fentanyl or paint Hello."
14989.0,Patient,"I.

I asked my elders in church, not to you know how what, what do you think they said Steve you got a good head on your shoulders do what you think he should do. I went to the pain management for 15 years and actually I could still be going to the pain management, but after 15 years me and my wife sat down and we've been together for 22 years she said Steve she said this. We need to change, you know, was not like it was a crisis or anything, my home was paid for I I live well but it's time for a change, so we left the pain management doctor and I believe that be the one of the best decisions we ever made together and I.
