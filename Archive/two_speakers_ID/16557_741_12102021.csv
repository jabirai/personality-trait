741.0,Provider,hey. hey oh oh you don't look good.
16557.0,Patient,Hello alone.
741.0,Provider,All right. holy cow what's that.
16557.0,Patient,Oh.
741.0,Provider,"I love what what I didn't know you had an appointment today, it was yesterday."
16557.0,Patient,"What it was supposed to be yesterday and I totally forgot, and then they texted me at 430 and they're like yeah you missed your appointment at four i'm like well it's only a half an hour like I could still join it but. They reschedule it."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, they fail to tell me that they reschedule. So that's Okay, but um. I don't have your file sitting right in front of me. Which is not good, I don't remember what we talked about last time. That way, I can make notes. i'm getting old and feeble and I forget. That was it. Did you look at it."
16557.0,Patient,"yeah I looked at it, I mean it's a little bit hard to do goes on my phone. i'm. I was able to look at it a little bit."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, did you jot down any um. Any say that you thought about like."
16557.0,Patient,It was. Like. To like prevent relapse so. yeah.
741.0,Provider,That was. That was just asking new questions like what have you done in the past. or two relaxing. and
16557.0,Patient,Like what like what leads to a relapse basically right.
741.0,Provider,"Right right. And stuff that would indicate, you might be headed for one maybe."
16557.0,Patient,"Well, I mean. Like I don't know like with me it's kind of like. Like once I get into my head i'm going to use i'm going to use. we're all like there's no. Going back or stopping like once I make up my mind i'm going to do it."
741.0,Provider,But what we're trying to do is. Have you asked before you get to that point.
16557.0,Patient,"Well, no i'm boy. Oh no like i've there's been times, where like like i'll i'll end up using because, like i'm celebrating you know it's not always something bad."
741.0,Provider,"Right yeah no I know. Because you don't because that's your definition of celebration. So i've been trying to say that we need to learn to define celebration differently, for you. See using us to be, for me, it was a celebration, it was a way to have a good have a good time and it was my reward for doing something that I didn't want to do. You know, it was my pet on my back. I deserve to do this. Equally satisfying. to celebrate do by doing, other than using right."
16557.0,Patient,Oh.
741.0,Provider,I know that something that's hard for you to wrap your mind around but that's the truth there are. Things that are a lot more satisfying than that so celebrate.
16557.0,Patient,"So, to be honest, I really don't know what there is that is that satisfying but. Like it's also. Like I also hate it at the same time, because I know once I get started my life is pretty much over with."
741.0,Provider,"Right, because you can't stop. I know because once I started I don't stop. Until someone outside of myself stops me whether it's jail or. God knows what other horrifying thing I mean cuz lots of stuff has happened lots of negative stuff. And then it all comes about when I start using because I don't know how to stop. So. Somehow some way we've got to figure out. Another way to celebrate so that we don't wreck our lives. Right, I mean surely not want to continue making your life over and over and having to rebuild all the time."
16557.0,Patient,i'm hoping that this is my last time that the bottom.
741.0,Provider,"Okay there's Another thing we gotta believe in ourselves that we can do this, do you believe you can do this."
16557.0,Patient,Before.
741.0,Provider,"Kenya, but have you stayed stop."
16557.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"Because if we if we can we stop all the time, really, we just can't stay stop. I mean I stopped every time I run out of money and can't pull another trick to do it right. So I can't find another hustle to come up with the money to do what I need to do so yeah I stopped. But then I don't stay stop because the minute I get money in my hand i'm gone off and running again. and So obviously somewhere along the way, I have to. Define celebration differently. I have to learn to stay start. What is it gonna take for me to stay stop. Okay i've managed to stay stopped for 15 years. Pretty awesome. asked me cuz that's a long time. someone like me. So. Is i'm not saying a simple because well it is simple it's just not easy to do, but these are some of the things that's why I sent that that this worksheet to you so that you can look at some of those things so that we know where to start working."
16557.0,Patient,We can.
741.0,Provider,I can't help you build a house if I don't know what we've already got.
16557.0,Patient,"Well i'm. i'm gonna have to go through, and just just do everything on their machine I."
741.0,Provider,don't wanna I.
16557.0,Patient,don't want to.
741.0,Provider,Do.
16557.0,Patient,It.
741.0,Provider,The questions you don't really want to put it down and black and white.
16557.0,Patient,I don't. Like.
741.0,Provider,"But, but if you don't. If you don't take the time and look at it and think about it. what's the option what's the other option what's The other possibility, if you don't do it, and then, how do you stop it before it starts you. Know addiction is a cycle and we've got you in a place where you've stopped, but we've got a main we've got a break that cycle in in here before you use again. So that's what this is designed to do. To help you look at what are those things that we need to work on what are those skills that we need to. To work so that you can stay stock. And we have that people will look at me like i've lost my ever loving mind when I say we've got to have a written relapse prevention plan. Because the reality is you're gonna get triggered your there are going to be things that come up that you are going to want to use and unless we have a plan in writing. for you to take steps in the other direction. The chances of you making the right choice at the right time, are not as good. As every time I tried to fly by the seat of my pants in those types of situations, I made the wrong choice and ended up in a mess. So. I know that having a. relapse prevention plan works, because if all else fails, I can pull out this piece of paper or these index cards that I have this plan written on, I say okay now, what do I do, because if i'm leaving it up to my own judgment i'm going to mess up. As a very black and white. So. that's that's the whole reason now i'm going to send you another one, because I want you to keep working with this okay there's another one that that you pull out your triggers what is it the triggers you. Okay, one of the things and I found out, oh no i've been in recovery for six or seven months somebody pulled out some vinegar to cook with. And I started smelling that vinegar and I was looking for the spoon."
16557.0,Patient,Because.
741.0,Provider,It was an automatic reaction right. There are things smells sights sounds and all kinds of things that can trigger us emotions.
16557.0,Patient,yeah like there's lots of places like music that I can relate to.
741.0,Provider,"Right, especially music musics a big one for a lot of people if you. start listening to a particular. song. or a particular artist, it can trigger that memory and last."
16557.0,Patient,Of all the places i've been and all that i've done while I was I you know it's all right.
741.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And it starts it starts you on the road to all the positive memories, but the thing you gotta do is flip on over and say okay what goes along with all of that. What do I end up every time. You know those types of things. Those are the things that you gotta kick into gear okay let's play this tape all the. way through. cuz I never fails every time I go out on a run I end up homeless and you. end up in jail. and So those things we have to look at those things and and be realistic about it yeah it sounds like a lot of fun and Those were some nice memories, but. Do I really want to go there. So, and so like I said i'm going to send you the other. worksheet. And you might want to write them down like in a spiral or some kind of like notebook or something. So, because if you're like me, you write it on a piece of paper, and then the piece of paper disappears if it's not attached."
16557.0,Patient,To pile on the desk.
741.0,Provider,"haha and then you can find it when you need it. um. So yeah I mean. i'm not trying to be a slave driver, but I want to, I want to get you to a place where you don't have to have somebody. talking to you, every week or every other week. Well, you can do it on your own. where you can also resolve some of the issues so that. they're not triggering you. A lot of people have emotions or states of being like boredom that tend to trigger them. Well, as. boredom as an issue, then we need to figure out how to keep you from getting bored. Without turning you."
16557.0,Patient,So much.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, but. You don't have to be a human doing. So we've got to find a balance between boredom and doing and taking care of self so that you can rest does that make sense. Like do you have a list of things that you enjoy doing. That diane loves music."
16557.0,Patient,"I don't even know because I was using for so long that. No, I don't really know what to do, like."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. So maybe you need to make a list of the things that you think you might like to do, or you think you might like to learn how to do like Is there something that you ever wanted to do, but you may not have never have ever learned it, but it might be something you might want to try now. So that's another thing that you another assignment for you is to make a list of hobbies or interests. That you either participated in the past and enjoyed or you think you might enjoy now or that you would want to learn. Okay. That way we can figure out how to. be a human being, or you can actually nurture yourself. and take care of yourself because working yourself to death isn't isn't the answer. It really isn't. I don't know about you, but i'd be measurable. mean the money is nice but. If I if I work all the time, then. I don't know I just i'm out of balance. Yes. I know somebody was talking to you."
16557.0,Patient,"But yeah I mean there's like I mean there's lots of things that I know that I used to like to do, but now, when I think about it it's like. Like I don't know I don't think that there is that I would like to do."
741.0,Provider,"Well yeah you grow on you, I mean the older we get our our desires and and our likes and dislikes change. Now there's a lot of stuff that I used to do when I was younger that I sure as heck can't do now. I love to do your gymnastics but. My body doesn't work that way, no more. i'm barely i'm barely able to walk to the chicken coop. So. yeah i'm not going to be doing gymnastics. So. Yes, when things change and you probably do have a different. set of things that you would be interested in doing. So. that's you know. figure out what you think you might like to do. And then we'll work on trying one or two every now and again. I see what you think. Okay. Okay, so. She. And a hobbies list. Have you had any other challenges, besides just not wanting to do it."
16557.0,Patient,Like i've been i've been going to work for our early. Really so.
741.0,Provider,i'm purpose. I want you to have because you want to.
16557.0,Patient,Oh.

16557.0,Patient,So. really what i'll do I know.
741.0,Provider,"Oh i'm sure if you're working yourself to death you're too tired to do anything. But you're too tired to take care of yourself. Emotionally physically spiritually all of it right. All right, do we have another appointment."
16557.0,Patient,"No Oh, we had to set that up."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, I need to see one more time this month."
