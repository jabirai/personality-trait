191.0,Provider,Okay.
9507.0,Patient,"last thing write a. lot better at that, and I want to kind of codify and first order logic, because i'm in an era of luck course and I made it too hard so i've kind of tried codify what rules i've learned about chess and maybe i'm reading it, and again programming. here."
191.0,Provider,"In the fire hopeful women i'm listening to you, the only reason. Your your your arm. You coming in and out that you want to turn off your video, for me, because this speech is coming in and out okay."
9507.0,Patient,"Let me see if this works, I might go out for a second but."
191.0,Provider,Okay i'm still having a difficult time hearing you.
9507.0,Patient,but can you hear me at all.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, now I can hear you. yeah I. Think i'm gonna have."
9507.0,Patient,To data in order for it to be.
191.0,Provider,Okay okay. let's get straight to the point. What is your purpose for coming to see me so yeah we can. Work has.
9507.0,Patient,"made a mistake and I will admit that I made a mistake, I kept telling Isaiah. That I was fine we're going down from the taper when I really wasn't and I have several concerns my main concern is that being given diazepam which is like. So I was taking clonazepam and that's not I don't mean clonazepam because I know klonopin is you know there's the brand name klonopin and that's clonazepam and I wasn't taking that I was taking a designer benzodiazepine to combat seizures. It was a mistake, I know, making. A colon as a lamb it's a it's a whisper synthesized in 1970 and it's one of the strongest benzodiazepines substances, you can get. So my point that i've been trying to make to people is that I don't think the value is sufficient for a taper from that because it's. I mean it's extremely potent it's active, you can block it like so with 200 micrograms you can risk blacking out if you're small. At 500 to 700 you can easily blackout, so the idea that you know 40 milligrams of valium is going to be sufficient to get me all of this, when I was, I was taking 2.5 milligrams. three to five times a day."
191.0,Provider,You would take a 2.5 milligrams three to five times a day.
9507.0,Patient,"yeah of colon as a lamb, which is. Okay, the same. And then that's that's really potent so I mean, I think the issue is the."
191.0,Provider,"You know what is your you're having now. what's going on, how are you feeling now."
9507.0,Patient,"All right now I am. Still, like freezing cold my body like I have this compulsion to move edge keep active seizures the main issue whenever I get the withdrawal symptoms it's like access the. And so i'm like i'll end up like shaking my leg I took I took my dose today but i'm down to like one and a half, so it doesn't really mitigate much of the like the movement disorder aspect of it and it's been miserable the whole way through."
191.0,Provider,"i've started doing this book yeah I looked at your dose you were just on. The value of your current dose twice a day, how are you doing on that dose."
9507.0,Patient,"terribly because I mean it's been terrible when I was taking 4210 milligrams twice a day if I had symptoms, then like I ended up staying up for 48 hours, when I first went to four but I said."
191.0,Provider,Because. value of 15 milligrams a day total because what i'm looking at.
9507.0,Patient,"that's the big problem is that I kept saying well because I wanted to get off of it quickly, so I kept he wasn't pleasant, but I kept saying he said, do you want to go down, and I said. Sure yeah i'll go down because I mean it wasn't I mean it was it was terrible, but I can at least maybe why couldn't really function I mainly to do things but I thought that was kind of part records, but now i'm kind of thinking differently."
191.0,Provider,"How are you feeling, can you tell a difference from the 15 to 20 milligram when you decrease from."
9507.0,Patient,"I can just basically there's no dial describe it this way there's no difference between taking not taking it to that point. mm hmm, even if I just take like both I end up still pacing around and having a seizure symptoms, plus my hand to get really gold my core body temperature stays warm. Even though we don't have any heat in house. or getting that repaired, though. curious is because my friend, when he was tapered off alcohol he got out of and they at least gave him at a van but. volume and liberate them are weaker kind of benzodiazepines and I feel like if someone's taking massive massive tolerance. of her guests such a strong average IQ, you would think it would be sensible to prescribe something at least comparable to taper off of it but i'm not sure, since it didn't plan is a lamb didn't come on the market till 2015 it was synthesizer 1970. But it's a designer drug."
191.0,Provider,"So we've we've been able to successfully get people off with the liberal value out of band and. yeah strength wise have been able to. cross the board use different ones now of course different people respond differently your metabolism is different, but been able to keep people off seizures using either one of those Okay, of course, the the value in the liberal."
9507.0,Patient,"Being literal. paper, and then they give me medication called carbon carbon nas opinion or something like that curve. OK magazine."
191.0,Provider,"Right, and so the thing is, is that um we've been able to get people off without seizures. And so far i've been able to do either one, and you know, in the past and the hospital we use the Fino Barbara tall so and, of course, an event like that a band too, so my question is, are you doing your territory also."
9507.0,Patient,"You take all of that. Oh, the carbon so that's the that's the energy, yes, yes."
191.0,Provider,yeah I have you had any leisure.
9507.0,Patient,"yeah it was like a few days back. Okay, what you do."
191.0,Provider,What was your last seizure.
9507.0,Patient,"i'm not quite sure, because it was this week and, last week I think I might have been last week because I had I was um. i'd taken like a small dose like maybe one of one out of the whatever I take per day, I always have to look at the instructions, I am or just let him in my pill organizer easily do that, but I was I had had issues with the pharmacy shows withdrawing from both so I don't know little. i'm going to ask you this question yeah you."
191.0,Provider,"When you're on the tablets the value them. yeah you're currently on the 10 milligrams when you took the 10 milligrams twice a day, did you feel better or worse or the same as opposed to taking the 15 milligrams a day."
9507.0,Patient,I felt better taking them feel better taking. 10 twice a day yeah that was always tolerable and i've been I was trying to negotiate with natalie because I mean it was barely tolerable.
191.0,Provider,"Then Okay, then, there have been like um."
9507.0,Patient,"But he said she said, like five is too much and i'm like Okay, well, I tried to argue, but she wasn't having it, but I mean. If you look at when you're going to like what I do understand exactly how we know the like you know if something's potent in the in the micrograms that i'm taking milligrams of it, I feel like there's. A very high chance that, I mean cuz I was just thinking about the regulation that results in because you know what are you know more you ever receptors in the brain, I mean that must have greatly depleted gabba and also caused a lot of gamma receptors to be created filled up right and."
191.0,Provider,"that's reason why so what I usually do in situations like that, because yeah definitely you think about up regulation down regulation OK, but so often, when you give the body, a chance to adjust it often does adjust. And so, whenever there is an issue adjusting, then I go back up and you have to give your body more time and i've actually had people where you try to take that dose down even slower small dosage longer interval okay. yeah. My mom's me exactly So let me ask you this Okay, with the current dose at 15 milligrams I need a yes or no answer because I got to get some concrete things and I need you to focus with me okay. deal okay with since the time that you started the 15 milligrams it looks like that started on on 928 okay cuz I look back at your record. started that have you been having any shaking. Any shape tremors."
9507.0,Patient,"Yes, termers like my fingers will twitch i'll have that and i'll. Okay, you know kind of weird in my head to like."
191.0,Provider,I have you had any seizures.
9507.0,Patient,"I, yes, I believe, last week, I think. Okay. Even though I didn't take the."
191.0,Provider,Any any way.
9507.0,Patient,to pronounce it. yeah.
191.0,Provider,"I swear i've been really sweaty and cold, at the same time. sweaty and coal, so it sounds to me like you've been having some withdrawals, is it just I don't want to put words in your mouth, but let. me know. When you are on 20 milligrams let's go back to before September 28 Okay, how are you doing before September 28th."
9507.0,Patient,"I haven't really been functional since I was on the on the for like 10. Well, two pills 10 milligrams or. twice a day. Okay, since then and I again so we're."
191.0,Provider,On the 20 milligrams a day.
9507.0,Patient,20 milligrams twice a day yeah that's what I.
191.0,Provider,gotta say 20 milligrams twice a day 10 milligrams twice a day 20 milligrams total. Where you come from.
9507.0,Patient,"I was comfortable with it on whatever I started with, and that was for pills. Two in the morning to do at night and I. don't know what the milligram on that was I wasn't really comfortable whenever I started, I was coming through I wasn't comfortable, but it was tolerable when I started kind of I mean, I still couldn't get anybody funding and whatnot."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like when you were doing a 20 milligrams twice a day is when you are comfortable. Yes, yes Okay, so that your comfort dose is 40 milligrams a day. Alright, so i'm not going to 40 milligrams a day, but what I do want to do is get you take you back up to the prior dose. And let you stay there, and allow you that time to adjust OK, so the way it usually works is and you notice it, you talked about the receptors he talked about regulation down regulation. It sounds like from what you share with me that junk that taken away the extra five milligrams has made a significant difference, even to the point that you've reported a seizure Is that correct, even though you've been taking. A tiger tech tall right."
9507.0,Patient,yeah and it's I also was for the most part of the taper i've been basically better and. i'm going to start with it for a while I got better you know i'm not better than right now i'm able to do some stuff but I had to take a long hiatus it was a long way through I got to this point where I could do much.
191.0,Provider,So.
9507.0,Patient,"I have to go back to I don't want to have to go back to the designer drugs is the only concern. Because i'm not on it, because I like it i'm on it, because the withdraws terrible that's the only reason I was on it in the first place. Because of the people at my previous mental health clinic they wouldn't give me suboxone and I was on create them and I wanted to switch over because it was even that was giving me seizures they wouldn't give it to me immediately."
191.0,Provider,And they only give you which. ones box on.
9507.0,Patient,suboxone they wouldn't give it to me they will madman week for months and I asked them how are you going to give me into pursue the prescriber in my case managers plan was get this. to become my nurse. In six months after i'd already had 12 seizures from the cradle.
191.0,Provider,"Oh, she wanted to become my nurse."
9507.0,Patient,"Because I mean the other nurse that have had a confrontation and so she didn't tell me, and she goes sold in five minutes by just saying you know you can request a new nurse. And I would have done that, but they didn't inform me that I can do that I knew I could do that for therapists and psychiatrists I didn't know I could request a different."
191.0,Provider,nurse okay so let's go ahead and how are you doing your suboxone you told me your suboxone and. So I think that's fine yeah okay.

9507.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no, no, the only one, there was one time, when I ran out of. diazepam in the pharmacy our pharmacies in common, I did this was a while ago, though I did take. Some clonazepam again because I just they wouldn't give it to me for a week. And we try and read it."
191.0,Provider,"Right, I want you to not do in a clean, as I am I am I want you to not do any. benzodiazepine what we do, we documented this. And no opioids know uppers know downers I. Know right."
9507.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't I didn't do any of that until like that. out of control, and I was that started having twitching and that was back before I had seizures."
191.0,Provider,So so. What does the marijuana do for you.
