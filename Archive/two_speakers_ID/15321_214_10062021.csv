15321.0,Patient,And alyssa bradner 829 97.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, great so this session is about me asking some more questions because I don't know the answers to them and figuring out how we're going to work together so can we move forward with this session. Yes, awesome so what brings you to bright heart."
15321.0,Patient,"um, I was interested in being medicated because I struggle with a lot of mental problems."
214.0,Provider,"i'd say i'm going to hold that for a minute continue now we're going to touch back on peace okay great do we have any chronic pain issues. We have any substance use issues. Okay, so now let's go back to you use the word struggle right so have you ever had any mental health treatment before. Have you ever been diagnosed before. No Okay, so now tell me what you're struggling with."
15321.0,Patient,I struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression and ADHD i'm assuming.
214.0,Provider,Okay. Well that's okay. Have you ever been tested for ADHD. And do you know what those symptoms look like a what they. What the difficulties are about attention deficit.
15321.0,Patient,"i've read up a lot about it and I talked to chantelle a little bit about it. But. i've never liked been through the process anything so I don't know if I actually have it, but it's what i've read up on it seems like I do."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fair enough, and in your discussion with chantel What did she say about it was she gave you at all."
15321.0,Patient,yeah so seems like she believed me I guess.
214.0,Provider,"Well, you probably took a survey, or you played that something to. confirm what's going on, how do you feel with the adderall."
15321.0,Patient,"I definitely I definitely like it a lot, and it also has helped a little bit with my depression, anxiety, but still not enough, I feel, to like be as functional as I wish I couldn't be."
214.0,Provider,"I kind of found enough. yeah let's let's take a view of. So I just want you to see something this is your chart. is not your child, this is your. survey and you fill this out right, so I want to talk about what it says and talk about what you say, so the pH Q nine is a fancy word for depression score it comes up with eight eight is mild do you think depression is higher than mile. But the score is only eight, so I just want to like sometimes what we believe is happening or what we feel is happening isn't really factual. it's more catastrophic. Or, more bigger but it doesn't mean that this and i'm not minimizing what you're going through i'm just wondering if some of your thinking your cognitive thinking is like oh man, this is really bad and maybe it's not really bad maybe it's just bad right."
15321.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,So your anxiety is nine. You think it's higher than that.
15321.0,Patient,And if the scale of one to 10 nine is probably.
214.0,Provider,"Those skills one to 25. To the scores actually one through 27. So you're at nine which brings it back to mild, although it this reflects depression it's the same scoring for both."
15321.0,Patient,Interesting know my anxieties pretty bad like i'm pretty dysfunctional one of the time.
214.0,Provider,Okay nope all. Right. Did you do you feel that your concentration or completion of tasks are now better with the other all.
15321.0,Patient,"um I, I can see that yeah it's definitely gotten a little bit better I I just barely started taking it so i'm hoping, I see more progress. And i'm taking a pretty low dose so but it's doing something i'm definitely getting more work done at work and stuff like that."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, great so you're just taking 110 milligrams."
15321.0,Patient,"And yeah she had she told me to cut it in half, so I take half in the morning and then half liter."
214.0,Provider,"Of crash you'll crash it'll be a bad landing. yeah oh yeah it just it is but it's Okay, as long as we're seeing about a fit I really, thank you for that patient. Any suicide ideation."
15321.0,Patient,And not really.
214.0,Provider,So it was something not really.
15321.0,Patient,"Like I I guess I occasionally, I think."
214.0,Provider,"So that I know that the question is maybe intrusive but so all we want to know is, is there an intrusive thought, does it happen frequently is that every other day is that just in the mornings. It doesn't really stay in the last seconds that goes that's kind of why we ask these questions, so you said occasionally so is that, like once a day when I wake up before I go to bed when i'm on downtime."
15321.0,Patient,I guess like. and see if I were to average is probably like three to four times a week.
214.0,Provider,Do you have a plan. No so what's the wish what's the thought.
15321.0,Patient,it's kind of just like. Like would it be better I was your yeah.

214.0,Provider,What how did you get the power or control to stop.

214.0,Provider,And why have you felt the need not to do it.
15321.0,Patient,um. I guess my support system like my boyfriend I don't want to disappoint him.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fair enough. um. So you've never been treated for mental health. were born in 97. How long do you think you've been struggling with. That let's just use the word struggling How long do you think you've been struggling."
15321.0,Patient,"um. Well, with anxiety my whole life like from as far as I can remember i've dealt with like anxiety and not being able to like function in society and stuff like that, with depression, probably, since I was like. Maybe 1314 is when I can like really remember it being a presence."
214.0,Provider,For enough. Do you think anyone in your home life struggled with mental health or substance abuse.
15321.0,Patient,Right yes.

214.0,Provider,Okay. What was it like growing up as a kid and your family.
15321.0,Patient,"lonely I guess. mom was never around I grew up with my grandma so I was like an only child and I didn't have any friends, because I was so shy and anxious so lonely is the best word to describe it."
214.0,Provider,"So you also described, something else is pretty important so. The word i'm going to use this conditioning so really what happened was throughout you know you growing up. I don't want to say you isolated, but you felt lonely so you probably created a barrier which may have been awkward to make friends or. get involved with friends, and then we we took on more than that, as we got older and now we may have something like social anxiety and we don't feel comfortable and you know, like walmart or large gatherings and stuff like that."
15321.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,Where was where was not that like his mom was a monster what was that.
15321.0,Patient,And who knows. i'm saying is i'm doing something.
214.0,Provider,"So it says here you drink alcohol and you have. I guess one or two drinks, a month."
15321.0,Patient,And I rarely drink.
214.0,Provider,"You notice any difference when you drink if the next day is worse. Okay, fair enough, what about marijuana."
15321.0,Patient,And that's another like rare one i'd say maybe two to three times a month.
214.0,Provider,"Many changes of noticing the next day is worse. And now we have other inhalants, but that has to do with your asthma."

214.0,Provider,"yeah I get that. alright. Family cross addiction lonely. What was sixth, seventh and eighth grade like for you."
15321.0,Patient,"um those are pretty bad years just just in school, really, because those were like I got bullied the most during those years so that was pretty bad. But family wise it was pretty much the same like mom never around same thing same thing. The galaxy those are like the worst school years of my life."
214.0,Provider,What What about any friends or you still very isolated and lonely in school.
15321.0,Patient,"um my first friend I made actually was in the like towards the end of eighth grade and that's kind of when I broke out of my Shell, a little bit because she would kind of pushed me to like. Order my stuff that like restaurants and stuff, which is something I never was able to do so, I broke out a little bit, but it was still something I struggled with for a while."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and what about your grades, how we are great."
15321.0,Patient,horrible.
214.0,Provider,"Well, why would they horrible."
15321.0,Patient,"I could not pay attention to save my life like I would be drawing on my paper or I would be daydreaming or like I just couldn't focus and when it was like a classroom setting, but when I was one on one with a teacher, I would learn so much better because it was like."
214.0,Provider,Somebody instructions. Did you ever get tested while you were in school.

214.0,Provider,"I know I got it, but that goes back to the ADHD."
15321.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
214.0,Provider,How did high school was high school like.
15321.0,Patient,"um so I did freshman year, but I think my family realized that like I was struggling I was starting to go down a hill of mental health and they so they pulled me out and they put me into independent studies. Where I only had to go once a week to this building and like do like a week's worth of homework and then bring it back once a week, which is a lot better for me that's when my GPA actually went like. Really high yeah because I didn't have to go to class."
214.0,Provider,"But it also May. Be anxiety worse for being around people right so on one hand we gained a lot, and the other hand, like okay So did we graduate. Yes, okay great congrats and did we continue with any further education."
15321.0,Patient,"I went to I did take a really long break, because obviously school wasn't the most fun thing to me, so I took a break for a couple years and then I went back and did. I tried to do my G I did a couple G classes in college at OCC but I never finished anything so a couple classes."
214.0,Provider,"All right, i'm ever serve in the military. any financial or legal issues you're concerned with. Are you in a relationship."

15321.0,Patient,My boyfriend and three roommates.
214.0,Provider,"And what, what is your current employment status."
15321.0,Patient,full time employed.
214.0,Provider,Doing.
15321.0,Patient,i'm a manager at pebble island marketing grill so it's like a little market.
214.0,Provider,"Nice okay. All right, so your chart. says oh. So I don't see that in here, so it says you're seeing outside."
15321.0,Patient,"And I told the whoever I talked to last that I was gonna try it out with this one person I already had an appointment with before I saw you guys, but I ended up not really liking it so i'm probably i'm not going to see you again so okay."
214.0,Provider,"So can I change that in your chart is that okay. yeah, so I would be a therapist, by the way."
15321.0,Patient,"Okay, this."
214.0,Provider,"Is i'm going to change to be ah ah alright, so let me tell you what i'm kind of thinking. we've had a conditional upbringing from childhood till now, so the anxiety is real, but what further than that it's. we're not sure how it starts with not sure how it manifests and then it lands and then the world just sucks really at that point, like right yeah. So the things I think i'd like you to just listen to in here is. I work with a lot of anxiety patients and we work on a lot of different techniques and the techniques are I call them exercises, but then I like going to the gym. You do them every day and what you do is, you have a calm body calm mind, so the anxiety starting to REV up. It doesn't push you, to the point where like la i'm super anxious it's it's almost as you're. Controlling your heart and your breathing and it really keeps you relaxed instead of high intensity, I think that would be beneficial for you and I also think. between that and the adderall will see the depression Ashley diminish I really believe that and, over time, but you just need to be open to some of my suggestions and then I like jumping off a building and stuff like that. They may be like wow that sounds weird. But they work for the majority of people that I work with so one is like find three colors to sounds one smell another one is. learn how to breathe through a straw. Just regularly for one minute breach was strong don't don't say I got inside they got to use a strong start to condition, because what you're trying to do is rewire the way the brain. makes everything else react because that's what's happening there's a reaction to the action. If we can stimulate the brain and focus on concentration, like the one on one you said, with the detail you'll find the anxiety will drop because you'll have to focus on the show but they're just other things like that. So it looks like you go to group."
15321.0,Patient,"All right, yeah."
214.0,Provider,"And what group you're in you're not my group. You know Mondays group all right, and then, yes, so you've got a group weekly and you'll see me twice a month, so what what days work best for you."
15321.0,Patient,i'm really. Any day let's see. So I work Monday through Friday and i'm off at three every day. So anytime after three really.
214.0,Provider,So then i'm. 41 October 21 at 530 should be good feel.
15321.0,Patient,So Thursday yeah that should be fine.
214.0,Provider,"All right. i'll come up with a couple of things. That, I think, will be very helpful to you and then we'll talk about them and see how we implement them The other thing I think that's beneficial is you'll also have an additional two weeks on the Admiral just to see if that has any. Positive influences on the anxiety and depression, you may see those things just diminish. Just because it's super focus, you can get things done, you don't feel like oh my God I started this now i'm over here and and i'm going over there, like it'll it'll give you some more manageable. So be interesting to see what two weeks provide you that you'll be able to tell me so anything you want to ask me before we leave."
15321.0,Patient,um So do you have you have access to like my information. Right now um can you change like a where my meds get sent do you have access to that.
214.0,Provider,Bad I can't.
15321.0,Patient,damn it okay.
214.0,Provider,"That I can. hmm you you actually have to call the virtual clinic rx department. Now that could be a weight, I can be a really long way, but that's, the only way to do it. is to get on the virtual clinic rx department. And name, provide them with the new pharmacy. yeah that's The one thing I have no control over is changing. How that gets done."
15321.0,Patient,"Yes, I thought i'd ask."
214.0,Provider,"Now it's worth a shot, and I agree, I wish I had that privilege. kind of glad I don't but. But other than that, I think this I think you're going to find this to be very helpful, I really don't. And just you know be open to just hearing different things, and I think you'll find that, overall, you know within I don't know four or five weeks you're just going to feel a better quality of life okay. Okay awesome if you ever need me you call the virtual clinic you say I work with manny I need to see him they'll contact me we'll see each other that they just in case you needed okay."
15321.0,Patient,Thank you.
214.0,Provider,I took care of all by.
