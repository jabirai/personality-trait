8380.0,Patient,Hello.
298.0,Provider,wow you're really going through a lot right now. How can I help.
8380.0,Patient,um. I requested a refill for like one week of the xanax but I don't know. What to do. My pain management doctor. Just me too start using the bell buca. um.
298.0,Provider,How do you spell that I don't know what it is.
8380.0,Patient,b e l Bu CA.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, go on."
8380.0,Patient,So it's a. Film that you could put in your cheek it's.
298.0,Provider,it's it's it's like suboxone it's buprenorphine.
8380.0,Patient,Oh okay.
298.0,Provider,that's what I prescribed.
8380.0,Patient,Okay. I don't know if it's the exact same thing. Or what have you. But I had been on the patches which started giving me breakouts.
298.0,Provider,Like.
8380.0,Patient,"I remember the serious fluid fluid would like start coming out and. Then front page put. So anyway it's been a month, now that she's been trying to get get me the OK, for the bell buca. And today, I actually got the okay. For it, but I. I i'm worried because when I looked up like. The side effects for the other patch. It said it was an opioid Blocker. So it would have locked any of the pain. receptors and everything that I deal with for my back I don't know if it's kind of the same I don't know if you want to look it up."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, I am so here's what they say bell buca film is placed on the inside of the cheek which is different from suboxone which is placed under the Tongue both are identical and containing buprenorphine."
8380.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"So you're dealing with the same medication, but go on so what's your thoughts."
8380.0,Patient,"No, it was just that it took a month for them to. get it approved through my insurance, they have to produce a car."
298.0,Provider,that's right.
8380.0,Patient,"So, then, I ended up going. Through a different. pharmacy what was the. The medicine shoppe rather than CVs."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
8380.0,Patient,"So anyway that just happened today I didn't want to do anything until I talk to you. Okay, and I didn't know. If it was the same thing is like suboxone which is habit forming."
298.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah definitely buprenorphine is. it's a it's a partial agonist of an opioid so it's it's not as strong as like hydrocodone and those sorts of things. But the body gets very dependent upon it, and you go and go off of it, you just have to take trade it down now I think what is the dosage that they're giving you."
8380.0,Patient,um I when I was on the couch they were giving me 10 micrograms. I don't know what the new prescription was good.
298.0,Provider,"Well i'm kind of excited for you, I mean i'm hoping that this will help with your pain levels."
8380.0,Patient,"yeah no I I was too until it, you know my like I said I started, I had to move them every day and like this Harris would would start leaking. Then the patches would move around, I have to use medical tape to keep them on. and Then they would I mean, I still have one from a month ago that still reading pumping killing and what have you. And I told her, I was willing for the pain relief. That, I will continue taking the patches. yeah but she told me. that she wasn't going to."
298.0,Provider,"well. let's let's just hope that this is the right thing that it's going to start giving you the relief and that you get the right dosage that you need. Okay, and it looks like you're due for a refill on your sound next xanax does not interact formerly with the the buprenorphine so you're okay that way. Okay."
8380.0,Patient,"yeah be there, I refill I was supposed to have an appointment with Dr. It what her name was ma ma or something like that. Man yeah."
298.0,Provider,mahara or something like.
8380.0,Patient,"That right. But because i'm doing the cal jobs, I wasn't able to meet with her. Right and. So I missed my appointment with her and they told me that I couldn't have group on the same day as her so I missed both."
298.0,Provider,"So you're still going to you're going to start going to grill do your pain therapy prescribed by the other Is that correct, am I understanding correctly."
8380.0,Patient,"i'm still gonna. be going to group on so good to be seeing you. Okay, that the pain management i'm still getting. What they're doing is the cortisone injections. For three weeks. straight. And then on the fourth week they're doing the. facet joint. So. He doesn't do unfortunately the. radio frequency regulation because he doesn't put the patients under. haha so I guess i'm just gonna. have to see how that works out."
298.0,Provider,"Well, thank you for sharing all this tricia i've refilled your medication, it looks like it's time for a year cymbalta to be refilled to."
