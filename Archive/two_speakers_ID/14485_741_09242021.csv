Three packs of cigarettes a day, but other than that nothing major and she went to bed that night never woke up and 16 hours later, is a double funeral. So August 21 a month to the day later it was just the weirdest thing came over me and I knew that I was done, mind you, I went into a six month lockdown rehab right after that, so that probably helped you. But i'm yeah I did run off heroin ever since i've never even had the desire, like my counselor back when I first got clean he just say like quit overanalyzing on it, like some people never get this lucky. Today, no go with it and I learned to accept that and i've been like really sick off my soapbox and and had it like right there and i'm just too scared I remember when my mom died i'm just like I don't want to be 50 so doing this shit."
741.0,Provider,yeah that's true. that's true.
14485.0,Patient,"i've had a couple slip ups here in the last year, since so I had when that happened, I had a little over three going on four years, clean up of everything, and then I got retinue just one and. My Google that tied, and I was like oh it's been a long time, like, I can take the perfect. They were gone within 24 hours and that next day, I went on suboxone and then on and ever since."
741.0,Provider,So did you have.
14485.0,Patient,"No um he was in my life too, I was to which obviously I don't remember, and then I didn't see him again till I was 18 and then from 18 until he died like he was in and out of my life like no we weren't close at all. Except for like. him having guilty conscience of what about Daddy was and would give me money all the time."
741.0,Provider,yeah okay. And how about your sisters are you close to either one of them or most or.
14485.0,Patient,"Again I didn't meet my sister, so I was 18 um but me my younger sister, I mean we get to see each other once sometimes twice a year, because they both live in Cleveland um my my oldest son my youngest don't get along at all, but i'm. And I am I see my other sister once a year we're not as close like Sarah and I even though we didn't grow up together when we're together it's like we've been together, otherwise. we're just more on the same page. lana's a lot major like our Daddy so."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. And how about your children, you have a close personal relationship with your children."
14485.0,Patient,yeah very especially my older two because. they've seen more than most adults will ever experience.
741.0,Provider,Right right.
14485.0,Patient,"And it's made them like you know I used to always think man I wish I could take it back, but I wouldn't change it for nothing because it's made them amazing phenomenal people because of it, I think."
741.0,Provider,Right right they've grown through it.
14485.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I hate that I feel like especially my oldest daughter she's 19 I feel like she lost a lot of her childhood she had to grow up quick and play mom a lot. Even though my grandparents raised them, while I was out being stupid, but i'm like the last time I had relapsed she was nine she was the only one that knew, and it was just I don't know it was awful, but we can set and openly talk about you know and."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
14485.0,Patient,"Not that mad or upset and her just tell me how it makes her feel sometimes, especially now that she sees the younger to get the mom she was she always had."
741.0,Provider,Right right now me and my son.
14485.0,Patient,"Oh that's a different story he doesn't really talk about it when he gets mad at me he might you know say like cutthroat crap but he'll say hurtful you know, and I tell him all the time, like whether. you write it down and we talked about it, or something you're never going to get a you know we're not going to move forward and. He just had he's one and two baby and i'm hoping that. with him having this baby like he'll see I think our biggest thing is he feels like I abandoned and that I walked out on him that I love drugs more than I loved him, which is never nowhere near true. So I hope that it'll help us grow I feel like it well, I mean we're. yeah well right before, so my son i'm. Like my oldest to work really hard and we didn't come from anywhere from a lot of money, I mean. After my grandparents my mom and my grandpa passed that the House that we lived in that might have one bill that was the only stability my kids have ever known well their dad my ex husband. Everyone thought we were clean, you know I thought he was clean Well he burnt my grandparents house down in a meth lab. And for a month like two weeks after that I went to prison for four months, and he left one day and never came back and got with my ex best friend of 13 years, so my kids it was like Bam Bam Bam like a lot and. josh like just he he was phenomenal at sports so long story short, his junior year he was the only kid in Ohio to be named all state. And then his senior year he was named all Ohio and then he had a football scholarship well the beginning. ending a freshman going into sophomore year he started, you know experiment in college life, a little too much, and it was really freaking me out and then it got to the point where. He left college years ago living in trials and only smoke weed and sell drugs. And the day they called me to tell me that I had to be home they had something that is yummy all I could think about was oh my God like he's got a felony like you know he's just met because he was going to law school and. They told me that and I was like Oh, thank God, and I came in and told Jesse I was like I just I can't raise another kid and. few weeks go by and i'm like huh and now I think God every day that she got pregnant, because I mean for almost eight months he's been pulling 72 hours a week, he just got back into school and he has just watching him grow up so quick and this 10 months has been like amazing."
741.0,Provider,yeah fast whenever.
14485.0,Patient,"Like he was. Like he was really staring you know because I know he comes from a long line of addiction. That, I think that's a parent's worst nightmare like. you're recovering addict like. You do not want to see your kids after walk that path."
741.0,Provider,You don't want to see him go down the road you've already been down.
14485.0,Patient,"No, and you can talk to him to you yeah I know."
