13.0,Provider,This will be an emergency medical follow up with. Why the name is escaping me Elisa no del. hi. How are you today i'm doing okay. So tell me about going to Aspen.
3453.0,Patient,"um I was there for a little while and they were they were really nice they gave me an ekg. And they said, my heart looks good, and then they gave me a chest X Ray and they said that my chest looks good and, like my lungs and everything I assume is what they were looking at like besides my heart because that's what I asked them. And that night I went home and I slept really good, and I have any problems until yesterday again. When the sun went down for some reason that's when it starts when it starts to get nighttime and it progresses until the baby goes to sleep and then it just shoots like once my daughter's in her bed it. gets so unmanageable."
13.0,Provider,"yeah I can hear it in your voice just even talking about it, he just talking about it brings up brings up what love what's what's there."
3453.0,Patient,"Oh, but I think it's because I was a fighting it and making it worse, I like I i've been trying to figure out why it's happening and why. I can't make it go away, no matter how hard I try. No matter no breath say take."
13.0,Provider,"alicia alicia if you could hear one thing, would you be willing to hear one thing that will make all the difference. embrace it. Instead of pushing it away stay come here, let me understand you because you are treating it the way you were treated as a child."
3453.0,Patient,"I know you told me that last time and I I tried, I tried, I tried to."
13.0,Provider,"I did there's no. there's no trying there's come here, let me understand you come here, I I know you don't believe that i'll do it right, this time because i've never done it before but i'm working on it Come on, and you just keep saying. you're Okay, you tell it that feeling because you're used to being told yours don't count. yeah you don't matter if you start treating those feelings like that. you're poor you're your part that wants to be whole that wants to be accepted and loved for everything that you are. it'll it'll keep annoying you until you do. So this this consciousness of I want to make it go away, I want it to go that's your enemy, that is the enemy."
3453.0,Patient,"yeah it's just hard to. To. To take the time you know because I feel very detached. from going on around me and myself, I. don't feel like my like i'm in my body, I am. fully functioning, you know we gave my daughter a bath and put her to bed, and everything last. Night without incident, but I wasn't there."
13.0,Provider,"Right right so you've been working with one of your on parts right. yeah yeah so that part of you. That is detached but still convey your baby and get her to bed that's the part. That is looking to be seen and heard. She wants to be finally seen and heard, because when she comes up you want her to just be invisible like you made a part of you as a way of coping. beautifully she's a beautiful example of how smart, you are, you could. make yourself disappear to minimize the pain. it's just that it doesn't work in adult world. doesn't work to be a whole human being, you want to keep her and that part. Just needs to be understood now it's not enough that she exists, she needs to. get a different job description. Right. That make sense."
3453.0,Patient,yeah yeah. I think it just gives gotta take up more of. soul searching and like.
13.0,Provider,"No, no."
3453.0,Patient,Because I don't.
13.0,Provider,"I don't know what Lisa Lisa this, this is the crazy thing about this. The modeling that you got was to ignore to be mean to suppress to push away that's going to be your knee jerk response. The all of the energy that goes into that is huge compared to what it takes to go. What would I be like, if I didn't have to be go to war. What. Would if I just accepted. And I know you don't have to soul search you don't have to. analyzing and pick it apart you just have to say, thanks for showing up help me understand who you are."
3453.0,Patient,"yeah and like i've always been worried about everything, like i'm constantly worrying about everything, so the fact that this just does something that just popped up out of nowhere just started happening is insane to me um."
13.0,Provider,yeah and i'll tell you what it really.
3453.0,Patient,What is it different.
13.0,Provider,"What it what it tells me as a therapist is that you finally have enough self knowing with your work with one of your you finally have enough of it that this. wounded piece is willing to come up and be seen. You have enough ego strength now so it's exactly appropriate it's perfect that this would come up for the healing so you get to be so you get to blend now with more of the real you the authentic you the damaged pieces don't be has to be. walled off they get to come in and be a part of you. So the timings perfect. Again, that that knee jerk opinion of why did it come up all of a sudden, and this is this, I wanted to go away that's the enemy, that is, that will keep you from taking a deep breath and saying, let me see what's here what's the feeling the feeling is i'm disconnected. wow. Who, you know how old is she. What she what would that what does she need the most right now. What do I need right now love and acceptance it's almost all this love and acceptance."
3453.0,Patient,So that's what I do if it happens again.
13.0,Provider,yeah.
3453.0,Patient,I really hope it doesn't but.
13.0,Provider,"No, I hope it does, I hope it does because that's, the only way, in fact, you should like set aside about 15 minutes before your daughter goes to sleep to say come on bring it on bring it bring it on so I get to say hello to you i've been pushing you away. For a while now come on i'm ready for you, I can do this and you really can. Because all it is, I promise you all, it is, is a scared little girl. She doesn't realize how much therapy you've been in she doesn't understand the incredible advantages that you've overcome she just doesn't get it she's isolated in her scared little way, and she trigger you into every time you do something bold and brave she's going."
3453.0,Patient,"yeah that's really funny that you say that because every time me and gwen do parts work and we try and connect with that little girl, I have a hard time connecting with her and finding empathy for her. So it's kind of funny but I mean like it's not a coincidence of it's obviously connected."
13.0,Provider,"It takes a long, long time really it takes a long time, because your brain is wired to treat that little one the same way, you were treated you got wired. Just like it's a struggle with your own daughter sometimes you want you find the default way is how you were treated and you really have to be conscious and right on right be really awake. yeah treat your daughter better than you were treated."
3453.0,Patient,yeah it's a choice because it's like not what I was taught exactly.
13.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And and that's where the hardness is because that's you are literally remodeling your brain you're growing neurons that go from one place. to grow to another. And because the neurons that got practice your early experience has you wired over here ignore put down being mean right. There they're thick it's a cable going there, the one going to. Going inside feeling your feelings, this is brand new stuff. So yeah so see where being patient and loving like wow this is hard, of course, it would be hard look look what i'm overcoming. When there's that consciousness that's brought to it, the self compassion has some hope right for hanging out with you and then staying will be, of course, it's hard I ain't been here. Of course, it would be hard."
3453.0,Patient,"And, last night I after I sent you that email um it peaked."
13.0,Provider,So yeah.
3453.0,Patient,"That all picked because I knew I had to send you that email, and I was avoiding it because I knew it was going to make me think about what I needed to say and how about it was affecting me. And so, when it peaked I kind of just like I. invented to walk in and that helped I talked to him and told him I just I can't handle this i'm really trying to. Calm down and calm myself down and breathe, and then I took a bath and that helped a lot, I took a bath a really hot bath. And so I calmed myself down to the point where I was like calm. But I was so i'm sore from being so stressed out my whole upper body, yes, so sore yeah intense for four days straight. yeah so."
13.0,Provider,Imagine if you mean would this part with this tender. wounded scared part. would like to give up all that struggle.
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
13.0,Provider,How do you know.
3453.0,Patient,Because it's causing it's causing all of me all the pain it's it's.
13.0,Provider,But it doesn't know it's doing that all it knows is it's trying to keep you safe. The way you got safe as a child was you created that tender part that shut down.
3453.0,Patient,yeah. So just accept it.
13.0,Provider,But.
3453.0,Patient,You don't push it away don't ignore it.
13.0,Provider,"When you work with one of your on it really get get get another session with her because. You know you will do things like you could, and you can do it between until you see her you can ask this part how old, do you think I am right now. what's it say."
3453.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm not in the right headspace I guess to. get there right now. yeah usually takes me a minute to connect with with my inner parts like we. Are together.
13.0,Provider,"So you might find that when she comes up today you later on in the evening you might say to her hold on a second little one how old, do you think I am. Because, if you think i'm still six years old, I gotta tell you i'm not. I have learned so much in the meantime, and I really appreciate that you kept me safe, and you know look around what we have we've got a home we've got a partner that loves us we've got a child that we're like redoing all the pain that we live through we're doing it right. yeah so she she gets to see that she gets to because she can't right now, because she's not blended she hasn't merged into your authentic self. she's just hunker down and she gets triggered to keep you safe keep you safe keep you safe she has very little perspective, you have to listen to her. And then help her understand that she doesn't have to be. on guard all the time."
3453.0,Patient,"That helps this all all of this Oh, this really helps honestly. It does. it's just really hard just."
13.0,Provider,hideous. It really is.
3453.0,Patient,"I can't sleep like I couldn't sleep all night that's why I didn't talk to when this morning and everything, because I slept Thank God Joaquin was off I slept until about. Five minutes before I responded to your email. Because I couldn't sleep right my brains just."
13.0,Provider,yeah.
3453.0,Patient,"you're gonna have another panic attack you're going to have another panic attack over and over and over again, so I would get to relax and get 10s and relax and I just couldn't. Wait. I think I got about two solid hours of sleep possibly."
13.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Eventually you'll find out and there's no reason, you should believe me, but I will tell you from personal experience. When I realized that I. Create my thoughts I generate thoughts they don't come out of the sky they don't come out of the blue they're based on experience and beliefs, when I generate them I get to choose what happens to them. it's my choice I can ruminate and go over and over and over or I can say hold on I know where that thought goes that one always makes me crazy always no exception it's always makes me crazy. So I get to say. toothbrush slight. get up and go do something."
3453.0,Patient,"that's what I was trying to do yeah yeah I was it's I guess it's called the 333 well where you know, and then you he listened to three sounds and then you wiggle three body parts and and grounded me."
13.0,Provider,And I.
3453.0,Patient,think I can find honest I know you have I know you have an in it.
13.0,Provider,"In it works you built new neuronal pathways now. When it first when you first start doing it. I tease people but i'm really not teasing it's like a million times a day. A million, like every three seconds there it is again wanting to press my brain into an old pattern so in the beginning it's like a full time friggin job to stay wait a minute I generated the thought I get to decide. If it's true, is it true that I will have a panic attack I haven't had one yet well let's see. It so. It and then you know I started this in 2003. When I when I got it when I woke up. And now it happens. Maybe once or twice a day. In the beginning it was constant before I built the pathways where I got I got control, it was like my brain had a life of its own and it decided was. In I was the victim, I was like the puppet. With the strings my brain was yeah and then I realized, no, no, no, no, I pull the strings."
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
13.0,Provider,And then you just take back the control. You take it back wait a minute that thought I know I mean you've had enough experience you can literally say wait a minute I know what what I could do with that thought it it'll keep me awake all night long.
3453.0,Patient,I did.
13.0,Provider,It always has so what am I going to do with it. Now count the holes in the ceiling tile it doesn't matter because it's anything's better than that but.
3453.0,Patient,"yeah you're right. Thank you doctor I really appreciate it, I really needed to. figure out like a game plan on how to to deal because I I was kind of just like. Last night, was the worst one like that i've had it was really bad so yeah."
13.0,Provider,"I want to point out to you that. And this is always a quandary for me, you know. If I had given you a pill. You would have been. Much more likely. To not hear anything we've talked about right now. You would have the only way you're going to know that you're in control is for you to be in control. If I if I give you a pill, and you change your chemistry I guarantee you I can I can numb you out where you don't think about anything you don't have a panic attack, but you don't think about anything."
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
13.0,Provider,"And you never get the skill, the practice to be integrated, you cannot do the work with one of your you can't do parts work when you're on a benzodiazepine. doesn't work it's been well studied can happen."
3453.0,Patient,"No, I thought that maybe I would get like a little tiny square like for bedtime and not to because that's all it really like wanted was so that I could go to sleep."
13.0,Provider,"Because well you can't you can't give yourself a square of God, am I ever trying man was I smart I got a therapist that cares for me i've got a doctor that that's a nice little Square. and watch your thoughts. The more time you give yourself in quiet contemplation that's a gift. Where you where your parts get to come together, your parts get to come up and say hey look at me remember me I keep you safe to what about me."
3453.0,Patient,gonna take a little practice but.
13.0,Provider,It takes a lot of practice yeah.
3453.0,Patient,"I just so I don't want it to keep me up, so I have to deal with it before you know."
13.0,Provider,You don't.
3453.0,Patient,really concerned about like I literally missed out on like. So many so much time with my beat today.
13.0,Provider,"yeah then then, then you have to on purpose give yourself time to do this. So if you if you will give yourself 15 minutes, right after your baby's bath with walking can watch her and you and you get your 15 minutes and all you do is going to quiet noticing. Then, your brain look your brain says she's been ignoring us all day we're going to get her when she lives down. yeah we're gonna make her pay attention to all we've been trying to tell her all day we're gonna wait till she's quiet. So give it some quiet before you go to sleep."
3453.0,Patient,yeah. I think that getting in the bath before I go to bed and kind of just like.
13.0,Provider,Correct yeah yeah.
3453.0,Patient,yeah the bath helps a lot and so.
13.0,Provider,"And that way, I promise you and I don't make a whole lot of promises, but this one really works, you make a discipline of giving yourself time and you don't make excuses. Say i've I haven't had my 15 minutes, I really need my 15 minutes i'm going to take it, no matter what, and then, when your mind starts to make mischief at night, you say oh i've already thought about that already been there that's that'll have to wait till my next 15 minutes. You get in the habit of."
3453.0,Patient,"Little work like. doing it will. Be awesome if I could feel horrible after and go about my bed time routine and or like hanging out with Joaquin or whatever. And then go to bed, that would be awesome so that I can take care of myself and feel normal after the way I feel right now normal just me that's how I want to feel. After I don't want to feel on edge, the whole time."
13.0,Provider,"So, so at least, yet the. The trap you just walked into is that it is normal."
3453.0,Patient,Oh yeah I mean just like not detached and like I just. feel so.
13.0,Provider,"Let me finish it is normal for someone who is experienced as much childhood trauma and wounding, as you have to have pieces that will pop up out of all the resistance. Right that's unfortunately normal until they get resolved."
3453.0,Patient,How do I resolve that.
13.0,Provider,"You do every. Time you're doing it you're doing it. But. You get into a trap of thinking that not having any feeling at all. Is what's normal or not feeling anything negative that's normal and unfortunately until there's that Nice. blending of and and resolving of the wounded parts. yeah they they're begging, to be seen and heard and loved and accepted and until they get that. they're going to be tweaking you."
3453.0,Patient,"But you can to say, because I can handle. I can handle the mental stuff I care, I am very strong mentally it's the body, the body feelings that that really get me it's the tightness and."
13.0,Provider,We.
3453.0,Patient,can't breathe and the feeling like i'm not in control of myself like it's the body stuff that really get me. So I really you know.
13.0,Provider,"Oh no you're. you're parts of figured that out. you're tired say. She has gotten so good at. Shutting her brain down that unless we register what's going on with a body sensation she doesn't pay attention. So it'll make you take short little breaths little tiny breath until your fingers go numb until you can't breathe in your heart beats faster, because it has that's all it all the tools that has in its little tool belt to get you to pay attention."
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
13.0,Provider,"And so, when when you do start feeling that tension it that's the perfect moment that's the that's the. The gift of recognition the gift of oh my God I finally get a chance to to look at this one, which ones here which ones come up what do you want to say. what's happening for you come on i'm ready those sensations are the perfect moments. For inviting accepting bring it in bring it in, let me hold you let me give you the love and acceptance I didn't get. Is it weird to think of them as gifts that tightness in the chest."
3453.0,Patient,I guess yeah kinda.
13.0,Provider,"yeah it is for most people. And then, did you flip it around and say oh that's my opportunity. Because you've already been to the doctor with yesterday you had two different doctors tell you. I mean the one doctor didn't say much, but she was shaking her head with everything I said right, and then you went to the clinic and you got the tests and still you overrode all of that, with an out of control mind. I know I yeah so I. Can and i'll tell you what else would have happened if I had given you a pill as soon as the pill started to wear off, you would have gotten anxious and not felt like you could control yourself and you would have asked for a stronger pill."
3453.0,Patient,But.
13.0,Provider,"This is what this is how people get into big trouble with benzodiazepines. Right, whereas teaching you that you, you really you are in control of your thoughts and, if you want to read a book, there is no better book on this subject than eckhart tolle a. He is it's a. it's a mind blowing perfect book."
3453.0,Patient,what's it called.
13.0,Provider,eckart tolle a. he's he's written a one called the new earth and then his first one is the power of now.
3453.0,Patient,So it's easy ar T.
13.0,Provider,"To get EC. K er T something like that to ll E. Okay, the power of now. And it's on on audio books and it's on I mean, I would say, you know get a used copy of it from Amazon and underline it and read it slowly. I did this thing, where I had it on CDs, there were five CDs and I drove around the country and just listen to it over and over and over. And I remember listening like around the third time thinking, I do I want to listen to it again and thinking wow I didn't hear that before oh I didn't hear that. it's it's life changing and you've already got some of the elements there. And this great smile that you have, and this lightness of being this is who you are."
3453.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you, I really appreciate you talking with me, I really needed it. yeah like I was going crazy."
13.0,Provider,yeah you're going that's what's happening.
3453.0,Patient,"Like there was something you know else wrong in my actual body that was like wow. Like I think Oh, they missed something they didn't see something Maybe I should go get checked again like. gorgeous pretty yeah."
13.0,Provider,"yeah because Look how easy that would be oh i've got this that a doctor will go fix I don't have to be responsible, this is this is hard stuff. You got to do the work you. there's nothing wrong with you, except that you haven't let these wounded souls in to be seen yeah and and I can't do it for you, I can just tell you it is so worth it, when you do."
3453.0,Patient,"Thank you, I really appreciate you going through it all with me, because you know, Google searches can only say so much. interpretation you know when. things up like you care Okay, then what I do."
13.0,Provider,"Then, what do I do."
3453.0,Patient,"how to do it, how do I do that so."
13.0,Provider,"The House. alyssa it, that is exactly it, I remember when I was first getting into psychology I would read these theories and I kept saying, but how what's what's step one then step two right, I want, I still don't know the recipe. So I get that."
3453.0,Patient,So tonight when I after I put my daughter down for bed. i'm going to go in and take a bath and i'm gonna listen to myself and i'm gonna validate. The parts that i'm hearing because they're valid right. And i'm going to love myself i'm gonna i'm gonna. be very reassuring and mean it and. So just let it have its time and breathe take a deep breath right yes. Right big deep breath. and not be so tense try and release it up.
13.0,Provider,"Well, and if you are. If you that's right, and when you notice tension, you say oh hello, who are you what would you like to say what's up."
3453.0,Patient,yeah because yesterday I just kept shaking it off. The shaking it up loosen up you're fine you're fine.
13.0,Provider,Right and you weren't fine.
3453.0,Patient,Obviously.
13.0,Provider,"Something needed to be brought in not pushed away. you'll get it you'll get it, and once you once you start doing it, then, then it just gets easier and easier."
3453.0,Patient,"Okay. I really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to talk to me i'm i'm sure you have things to do, but thank you."
