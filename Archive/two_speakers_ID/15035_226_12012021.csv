226.0,Provider,"So okay so with it, so I guess, there was an issue in October that I wasn't aware of that, I can point out. Okay, can you hear me yeah."
15035.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay cool. Okay. So, are you are you struggling."
15035.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,yeah what's what's going on here.
15035.0,Patient,"Oh um I went to town today, I had to go get meds and. had to do some stuff for my mom and. So i'll pay for that, for the next two days, probably because my ankle hurts my back for just. And i'm just bored of the pain, I mean it's an everyday thing and it just never goes away. So."
226.0,Provider,i'm wondering if you need like a higher level of care and. I mean.
15035.0,Patient,"I have, I do go to an orthopedic surgeon that did my fusion on my ankle and he was the one that diagnosed me with the RPS. and When I fell I don't know it was like a week and a half ago, something like that I hit my head my ankle went out on me and I hit my head all and screwed up my neck, and my back. And so now it's like I get up in the morning and it's like on fire, it feels the same as my ankle it's just. Somebody stabbing me and it's on fire and i'm crying and. Just I don't know they put me on norco. it's a pretty low dose and it doesn't really seem to do anything for me. But. I have to go back to my regular doctor on next I think next Tuesday. And so I don't know then they're going to X Ray because he didn't want to X Ray well, it was swollen. In case I broke something, and so I don't know just. My mom has the same thing, she fell, while she was working I don't know 20 years ago and her back and her neck and had to have a metal plate put in her neck, and when they did that. The they said that the trauma from the fall and the surgery caused the sea lps and they I mean they don't know how to get rid of it. it's what i've had these index."
226.0,Provider,"What is so yeah but a car, yes."
15035.0,Patient,"it's chronic pain syndrome. It just I mean. it's just something that they I mean they can they can do stuff to kind of make it. Not as painful. yeah and i've been from. My ankle but everything they've done on my ankle has not worked and the next thing they were talking about is doing the I have era where they stick a needle down in there and it freezes everything. But they did that on my knee and it was so painful like it, they couldn't finish it because I couldn't handle it it hurts so bad and i'm scared if they do it on my ankle how bad it's going to hurt. You know I mean. I helped my knee. My knee was just like slipping on me and I had a baker's cyst behind my knee. And that has not come back, since I had that that's been about a year ago, but this thing with my ankle it's just it just keeps dragging on and on and on it's been over three years."
226.0,Provider,yeah so.
15035.0,Patient,"And I mean they said they'd fuse it twice and it'll probably break both times, and then they were talking about amputation after that. yeah because they said they can't do anything I mean. there's just. If it keeps breaking the the bones are so brittle in there that because i've fallen so many times and when they did the fusion that it take out all the hardware that was in there. Because it was all broke. There was a screw floating around and. I mean. it's slipping again and I don't know if, when I fell if I mess something up in it so. I probably need to go back to shasta and see. The surgeon again before they do any more treatments and at least get an x Ray and stuff. But. it's just I mean, as the press before this, but this is just. I mean, I try I try to get up and do stuff and I try to keep moving all day. yeah otherwise, if I live alone in my bed i'm done."
226.0,Provider,"So I mean that's. You know if that's what you do that's to do you know, can you keep the phone still or whatever it's making me really."
15035.0,Patient,see it. yeah i'm sitting on the back. I don't know if you can see me now but.
226.0,Provider,yeah no that's way better I just can't do that movement makes me so sad.
15035.0,Patient,Sorry.
226.0,Provider,"that's okay so let's do let's talk about like some like three like three things that you can do every day that will help you, you know just, no matter how small they are like what are three things that you can do."
15035.0,Patient,"I like to sit outside I can you know I go out with the dogs and I can sit in the backyard for hours. Great and just. I. I get so depressed, though, because I wanna I want to walk and I try, I mean i'll i'll get up and i'll walk down the driveway and back and by the time i'm done doing that i'm already hurting and my ankle swelling."
226.0,Provider,"What do you got one of those gooders you know this gritters that they have for people that break through you know, like power in a cast."
15035.0,Patient,scooters.
226.0,Provider,yeah What if you got one of those.
15035.0,Patient,"I guess, I never thought about it, I used to have one, and when I left South Dakota I didn't have room to haul it, so I donated it to the Church, because they had me and I guess, I never even thought about it probably help a lot."
226.0,Provider,"So maybe that's another short term goal that you can like something that you can focus on because, at least if you have that you're able to go down the driveway you can you know, like you can go for like a walk like you know what I mean like you can get around at least."
15035.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"I mean, like, I know that that's you know. I know you want your ankle will be better and healed but. You know what I mean it just it gets you get to out and a little bit more. Like. awfully not it's really there's too much background noise yeah so who can you call for that."
15035.0,Patient,I don't know I am on medicare I could probably call them and ask them if they will cover that.
226.0,Provider,"yeah I would ask them, I think that sort of doing that will give you a little bit more, you know, maybe give you some feeling of more freedom."
15035.0,Patient,yeah. I was a today.
226.0,Provider,"OK, and then it's like what what's one other thing that you can do that would help you like."
15035.0,Patient,"I don't know. I guess I like to crafts and, but I can when I do on I can focus on something for a little while and then my mind just go somewhere else, so I have like if I do stuff like that I have like five different projects going at once. But that was helpful little bit because i'm sitting i'm doing it."
226.0,Provider,What about puzzles.
15035.0,Patient,"I can't focus long enough. Okay, it just I get irritated if i'm trying to it's just like reading a book I can't do it and, most of it, I can't watch it I can't watch an entire TV show either, because my mind just wanders and I just get irritated with it and. So. I guess listening to music helps."
226.0,Provider,yeah that's good one. Okay. Okay So what about like a can you think of like a long term goal that you'd want to work on.
15035.0,Patient,A long term goal. it's hard to think of anything because it's so hard to do anything you know. Just.
226.0,Provider,Maybe like a long term goal is to continue it like get into the chronic pain group.
15035.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,And attend chronicler hey.
15035.0,Patient,yeah I have an appointment tomorrow with somebody for that.
226.0,Provider,Okay cool okay.
15035.0,Patient,sure who it is but. The called is that.
226.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and that that'll be good, because the chronic pain grips going to give you some added support and no give me some coping strategies. Because. yeah yeah and you can also do the group. You know the group of shauntel and myself and."
15035.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,You know that's just more like mental health and then chronic pain just really focuses on like strategies for chronic pain. So that are you.
15035.0,Patient,know are. arguing in here.
226.0,Provider,"And so that will give you, you know. You know, two nights a week, you know where you have some added report."
15035.0,Patient,Oh.
226.0,Provider,i'm sorry go ahead.
15035.0,Patient,"No i'm why talk to him tomorrow I I will ask to do put into a group. Because yeah I think that would help I mean, because if I feel like all I ever do is complain and nobody wants to listen, you know. And it's hard."
226.0,Provider,"yeah, and so what happens is that you know when you're in that state which is very hard, I understand that you know, being a being a pain all the time is really exhausting. But it's about like even if you're able to change our thinking for like five minutes out of the day. You know, doing things in a really small increments. you're breaking that pattern like you're breaking that negative. You know that that thinking that keeps you really. kind of you know it keeps you stuck like you can still have like the pain, but the goal is to. You know, have some other things that you can do like I said, even if it's her five minutes or 15 minutes or half an hour out of every day. Where you get some kind of relief it doesn't mean that the pain is going to go away, but it means that you're redirecting your thinking and you're redirecting your actions. And that's that's like more of the code like when we talk about like in group, you know, for instance. You know, last night's topic, you know it was it was about like okay So what do you do when you get in a really bad place like what are three things that you can do. You know it's the same concept in the chronic pain group so you'll hopefully you'll get some ideas and and then you know your beer, with people to that are experiencing what you're experiencing so you don't have to feel so isolated."
15035.0,Patient,yeah well my oldest daughter stop talking to me because of. All the meds I was. On and. I was complaining too much.
226.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15035.0,Patient,don't talk to me for two years.
226.0,Provider,changed in the net that's.
15035.0,Patient,"Good it is. I mean. I know. She didn't want me around the kids because she was afraid that I was gonna fall, or you know something was going to happen and. I don't know I just. So my to I I had one of my my granddaughter. When. When she was. A year and a half old I was living in Oregon and my daughter was going to give her up for adoption and I flew out to South Dakota and daughter. Right and I met her for over a year. Right and then I when I was living in omaha actually called me again, and she was going to give them up to give her and. My grandson up for adoption and I drove and an ice storm, all the way to sioux falls and picked him up and I had him for seven months and now she won't let me to even walk to him. And she hasn't really hard."
226.0,Provider,yeah I got mental health issues going.
15035.0,Patient,"She is an alcoholic. I talked to my ex husband and she does talk to him. And he he told me that they were over there, the other day, and within a half an hour she drank three beers."
226.0,Provider,wow likes.
15035.0,Patient,"alone their dad is there, he doesn't drain he's he's good with them, but I mean. it's just it's hard to think of my daughter being that way I don't know. I mean, I guess, I used to drink a lot and one day I just woke up and I I was like. i'm not doing this anymore and it's been four years. And I haven't I haven't touched it I can't stand the smell of it, I just. I mean I don't even drink a glass of wine i've been offered and I just I can't. yeah you know I can't go back to that and. I guess that's how I was dealing with the bipolar and the depression and all of that was drinking."
226.0,Provider,right which.
15035.0,Patient,i'm sure. it's not a collar. and I think.
226.0,Provider,You think she's bipolar getting care daughters by point.
15035.0,Patient,"I think I think she. Does a lot of the same things that I did. So. I don't know I mean i've been on my meds for. Probably three years, without going off of them, because I used to go off of them when I felt better and I was like no I don't need these and. And i've stopped doing the running away and the moving around, and you know and sleeping with guys I don't know and. All the partying and stuff. stopped all of it."
226.0,Provider,Right and.
15035.0,Patient,"You know I I look at it, like you know my my normal what I grew up with my dad was gets a frantic. And what I saw as normal. As everybody else's us."
226.0,Provider,yeah absolutely and.
15035.0,Patient,"I didn't see it, I never saw it."
226.0,Provider,Do you think that some of your your physical pain is related to emotional pain.
15035.0,Patient,"Probably. yeah. I mean my my oldest daughter doesn't talk to me my son stop talking to me about the same time I just found out he's having a little boy i'll never probably see. I have one daughter I adopted when she was 14 she was getting passed around from one place to the next, and she moved in with us and her her grandpa couldn't take care of her and signed over custody to me. And I mean she talks to me um my youngest daughter talks to me, I have, I have twins. And those who are good, I have a really good relationship with them. And then, my second oldest daughter talks to me as long as she's not around my oldest daughter. And she's around her. won't she will not answer her phone. And she will block me. Does."
226.0,Provider,It do they live near each other is that how that works.
15035.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,So. Is it a goal to try and reconnect with the children that don't speak to you.
15035.0,Patient,"I don't know if it'll ever happen, you know. For me, no I don't want to. Put that goal there, knowing that. yeah I mean. i've tried. yeah I called them I leave messages on their birthdays and on every holiday I call them and I leave messages and. I never heard back. Nothing. I tried to write a letter to my daughter. and It didn't go well, she called me and called me every name in the book and then went on Facebook and I didn't know this because she had me blocked, but my mom's side. And she was just cutting me down and saying what a terrible mother, I was and what all I have done wrong and that I never took care of them and that she was always the one that had to be the adult and. I mean, and then her grandma got on there, instead of bunch of stuff and I wanted to say something so bad, but. You know I I just let it let it go. And you know."
226.0,Provider,"The best thing to do. and So then, you know it's focusing on the kids that do talked in that you do have a relationship with. No that's. You know that's where you put your time and your energy, you know if your daughter has probably bipolar disorder some kind of mental health issue then it's going to be really it's hard you know, like unless she's on medication, you know it's not it's. You know it's not. it's not you as much as that her mental health that's preventing you guys from having our relationship, you know she might still have some. resentment or anger, you know but. You know the the behavior that you're describing is very extreme so that That to me is an indication that there are some mental health issues going on, which is out of your control. Right, so you focus on what's in your control and it's like staying in contact with the children that you know it does your son have mental health issues to."
15035.0,Patient,"drinks yeah I don't I don't know you know, he was always. When the kids were little I had custody of the two older girls and. Their dad got custody of Zack and he took zach and left him with his mother. And he just wanted to take him away from me just wanted to hurt me he didn't want him. And zach was. Probably nine years old, and I remember, we were outside it was Christmas and we were outside I bought him one of those. remote control airplanes and it was just me and him outside playing with this thing, and after that I didn't see him again until he was 16 she took him and. And I mean once I did see him again he was really good I mean he would call me and he would come and see me when I was in town and just come and hang out with me. And then, all of a sudden Ashley started this thing about while you take too many pills and you're crazy and you're faking that you're hurting you know and and then zach stop talking to me too."
226.0,Provider,Okay.
15035.0,Patient,"And it's just hard. But I did start talking to my older sister again after about 10 years and we have a pretty good relationship now so that helps a lot, I mean she's got a lot of the same she's got fibromyalgia which I have, and I mean she has a lot of the pain issues, so I have somebody. That does listen right a little bit."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15035.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't go and show up at her house or anything I mean i've probably seen her three times in the last year, but we do talk on the phone."
226.0,Provider,And then my younger.
15035.0,Patient,I haven't talked to her for a long time she tried to get me to have a foursome with her and her husband and my boyfriend and. I haven't talked to her sense.
226.0,Provider,yeah there's a lot of like cut off in your family now there's more than.
15035.0,Patient,There is. And it's just I mean. I tried to deal with it and not be upset but sometimes I just get stuck on it.
226.0,Provider,"yeah I know it's hard not to, especially when it's your kids. And Okay, so I want you to make that appointment tomorrow for sure. And then. You know, look into getting a scooter just inquire that's all just to see. Now. Because we you know, the idea is to get you to do three things a day that just something like even if it's one thing a day one thing. let's just start there. So we can start to kind of change, like the it's just changing your thinking Okay, and I know that this i'm not saying this because I think it's easy i'm saying it cuz I know it's possible. And it just takes some time and it takes practice and it takes attention and perseverance and commitment, and yet even like if it's just a little change, you know that's all we're going for. Okay, so that's reschedule like just. Do thursday's."
15035.0,Patient,yeah. pretty much every day works.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, what. Okay, what I have."
15035.0,Patient,Their day and I fell asleep and I missed it. yeah That was what.
226.0,Provider,What about Thursday December 16th one.
15035.0,Patient,that's fine.
226.0,Provider,"Okay six. o'clock okay all right. yeah and then I want to ask, then we can talk about how your appointment, you know. You know how it goes or how it went. Talk tomorrow."
15035.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,"um and then also like what you can also do. If you're if it. feels right to you when you start to have chronic pain or i'm sorry when you start to have pain, you know I want you to try and tie I want you to try and name an emotion, to the pain."
15035.0,Patient,No.
226.0,Provider,"And then try and identify like what is that pain from like where's that like where's this emotion stemming from so. I mean, I know the pain is constant in your ankle um. But you know, like okay so let's say I have a stomach ache Okay, so why does my stomach ache what am I feeling right now, like what emotion is this propping cropping up for me. Okay well it's reminding me of something that happened, while I was 10 years old, what happened well this happened so what's the feeling around that is it shame embarrassment, is it guilt and is it you know, like trauma so let's start trying to identify some of this."
15035.0,Patient,"With that a lot of the things that I did in the past, and this kid could be something to do with Ashley and zach I don't remember a lot of the things I did I really don't and I try and the kids will tell me oh mommy did this, or you did that I don't remember."
226.0,Provider,I don't have it Do you remember. to remember some of your childhood.
15035.0,Patient,"Sorry, my dogs, I remember some things. But. I. When I look back it's like. it's just blank. there's things that I just get that I don't remember, I mean. I don't remember my dad's funeral. I don't remember my mom said one time that I was at the school and I was screaming and yelling at her and she ended up that a call the COPs to get me out of there. And they took me out in handcuffs I don't remember that. You know I. Think guess maybe that was one I. mean they knew that there was something wrong when I was little I started running away from home when I was eight years old."
226.0,Provider,what was going on at home during that.
15035.0,Patient,"moment i've got a divorce, and I was going back and forth i'd get mad at one and I go to the other one I mean and they live hideaways apart and I just get up and leave. and they're long. As. Well, there was a lot of fighting there was a lot of. Their life drugs, there was a lot of alcohol. You know I. I remember some things from them, but there's other things like. are totally blank. And I don't know why."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, I mean just the fact that we know what you've just described in talked about you know there's a lot of trauma there for you like, there was a lot and. And just in their divorce and any child that grows up in you know chaos like that and arguing with trends with alcohol it's super scary stuff man. You know, eight year olds don't know how to process that that is and adults don't think that eight year olds know what's happening, they do. So maybe that's like a starting point, like really starting to kind of untangle some of that journal it out, you know write stuff down, and then we can talk about it, we need a starting point, because I think that some of your pain physical pain is also emotional, I think. Chronic pain and emotional pain and and. I just do i'm not saying that's 100% by any means, but i'm saying it plays the part so."
15035.0,Patient,You know.
226.0,Provider,"If you feel like you're if you feel ready enough to do that let's start you know we can start addressing some of that you know you have to be ready, though, like i'm not pushing you to do it. You know, working through trauma and the only way to work through trauma is to work through trauma, but the person has to be ready on time, so I don't want you going places that can't be feel, can you can't handle that's not our goal."
15035.0,Patient,yeah. I don't know i've just always. avoided everything and ran away.
226.0,Provider,"Right exactly well that that was that's a Defense mechanism, you know that's what eight year olds will do or they'll disassociate right so that's a protective factor."
15035.0,Patient,But would have been other mine.
226.0,Provider,yeah so it's just kind of become a pattern in your life and so now now you're here and things have gotten you know the pain is unmanageable.
15035.0,Patient,"yeah because if it wasn't I probably have left. And I would love and I probably would have went off my meds to again so it's probably a good thing. it's, but it is."
226.0,Provider,"I mean for right now what's keeping you safe, you know it's kind of interesting when you look at some look at it symbolic symbolically. You know, like your ankles because you have so much pain there that you're not able to get up and run you know we'd like you're being forced right now you're being forced to stay in one place. Interesting okay all right, so you know do what you can do okay. You know, write down write down remember what you can remember, no pressure, you know. Whatever you feel you can do."
15035.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,All right.
15035.0,Patient,All right.
226.0,Provider,Okay cool all right and i'll see you on group on Tuesday.
15035.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, take care bye."
