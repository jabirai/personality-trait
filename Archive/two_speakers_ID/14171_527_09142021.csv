527.0,Provider,"Okay okay good yeah that's definitely an improvement for sure than the initial time we spoke. Yes, okay. Okay yeah one of the things I was going to ask about I know we didn't there was you know, trying to cram a lot of questions in and information and on the first session. But tell me, and I know we didn't talk a lot in detail about it because it's been you know, many years ago, but I know you had the gastric bypass surgery. Yes, um were there any complications or have there been any complications. Like issues with like diarrhea or you know."

14171.0,Patient,"yeah I had been fasting that day, in fact. You know I hadn't eaten since probably. Eight o'clock The night before and. The blood didn't get drawn until probably after 11 in the morning. Okay, so I mean it's been over 12 hours since i've eaten."
527.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, does it typically run low renee for you."
14171.0,Patient,"I you know after one of my pregnancies I started suffering from. hypoglycemia periodically. Okay, so I don't know if it's still kind of lingering I mean you know 18 and 16 years but. Okay."
527.0,Provider,"And then, it looks like you also had like low carbon dioxide."
14171.0,Patient,"Yes, I actually because the doctor i'm seeing now i've only seen him since May. Okay, and. So he's only gotten a couple labs on me. Okay, now I did I was able to sign on and still get access to some of my prior labs and. Looking at some of the prior labs on the CO2 and that it's. it's still low, and I sent. amanda a screen print up."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
14171.0,Patient,"That, and it goes back from like October 22 I want to say it was like. October of 2011 I think it was so."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, do they say why that's low or any any."
14171.0,Patient,"reason why i've never even had anybody bring it up to me okay. You know and. And, being an email i'm always more concerned about my hemoglobin than I am anything else."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, when I see a low number is like Okay, whatever you know yeah with me we love with somebody with that, yes, yeah exactly okay. All right, well, that gives me a little little more direction as far as I just had a I know I had a couple follow up questions for you, so. yeah so. What questions you have for me renee or what do you feel like would be some helpful things to focus on with our sessions, I know you're going to be starting to the group meetings but also if there's particular goals individually, that you want to kind of focus on."
14171.0,Patient,"I guess just overall I just you know, want to feel better about life and feel better about me and in and not be so critical of me. And you know, find a way you know better ways to deal with stress, I mean i've been throughout the you know stress training and stress that stuff and it's like. Nothing really helps I need to just find a way that I can you know deal with it without holding it and without you know becoming snappy with people and."
527.0,Provider,"I yeah. Has the snappiness increased sweetly for you like, do you feel like you're because it more depression related or."
14171.0,Patient,"Well, like I think overall it's gotten better in. In terms as far as you know, like. Since this whole thing came out because it's like i'm not holding this sacred anymore."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
14171.0,Patient,"But you know yeah over the last you know, probably three or four days it's gotten a little bit worse because I think it's you know, and I think it's just the anticipation of this, starting and everything, and you know finally feeling like you know i'm getting somewhere. yeah. So you know i'm hoping that that's all it is a I don't have I can't think of any other reason why would. I mean, yes, I have a stressful job, I have a busy job but yeah so far, my boss has been an absolute angel too, because you know he helped to get there, I think he helped a lot with the insurance as well, because he knows the powers to be miss. You know I mean my calls and then I like listening to him and said. You know there anything you can do, and he made calls so. Now the next thing I know i'm doing a. waiver so."
527.0,Provider,"that's awesome renee guys. yeah. yeah definitely definitely. yeah so right now i'm trying to think how many girls Russians they girls with us women in group. I think there's going to be six I think you'll be six now so. yeah. six or seven so yeah it's just it's a nice size group so some some of the women have been in, for you know some time and others are. Getting you know have progressed through the through the group, but still still have some more weeks ahead of them so you're they're kind of all in the midst of different different. You know, progress so that I think that'll be helpful, you know it's definitely we had someone new start last week and and then. yeah I think it'll be it'll be a good addition and definitely hopefully give give you some support there to cuz I know that it's always kind of scary coming into a group and am I going to fit in, and you know."
14171.0,Patient,"Yes, it's gonna be yeah. yeah yeah I think that's The other thing it's like you know what's involved, what do I can be doing what's it gonna be like. What are these other people. yeah like."
527.0,Provider,"yeah exactly well and actually i'm running part of the group tonight I run the first part of the group. And then, Catherine, then we take a break and then Catherine runs the second part of group tonight so so yeah so you'll get to see me again, and then I also do group on Thursday night too so. What should I say Thursday night because it's night for me it's afternoon for you. So yeah it's it's six to nine for me at night so so yeah I do Tuesday and Thursday so you'll see me a couple times and then you'll see me individually weekly as well, and then I think. Trying to think who you're going to see for the dietitian you are going to see K leanne and you probably haven't met her yet have you. know now okay so she'll probably reaching out to try to get an appointment scheduled with you individually so you're going to be pretty busy with with all of it. And then. Trying to think what else. i'm going to email over some information that will use for Tuesday group which is going to be a db T dialectical behavioral therapy handbook and also some diary card examples and a. Just explanation of what they are so will those that's kind of our structure group time on Tuesday, and then the second part is is a body image group. Monday there's usually a process group and a living skills group, and those are run by Jesse. and carefully and then you always have a nutrition group on Thursday and a process group that I do on Thursday and you'll be given homework assignments, I actually. Have a homework assignment that we're going to process Thursday that I that we did that we started last Thursday. So yeah there'll be assignments and and things that you'll be working on, you know in between group sessions that hopefully will give you some insight and some you know direction on. On your behaviors and and things like that so. Coping strategies that will work on as well, so yeah it's it's a it's a lot but you've got you've got a great support we got a great group of ladies, right now, so I think you'll be. Hopefully settle in just fine."
14171.0,Patient,Good.
527.0,Provider,Good yeah yeah so how's things with the family were you know how are you how are you and your husband like how is he you know understanding of all of the questions that he has or.
14171.0,Patient,"You know we've. And we've been together forever, but um you know, like I said, since this whole thing came out. You know when when it came out I don't know if I told you how the whole thing happened. I he would make me breakfast in the morning and then, even though he would make me breakfast I would still stop and get food, and I would get you know multiple burgers or multiple burritos or you know and one day he happened to see me and when the drive through because I live so close. Okay, so then he's like. Well, that can be her car so then he drove back and drove by my office and it wasn't there."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14171.0,Patient,"And then we pass each other on the street and. I mean, he was he was so upset he honestly thought I was cheating on him. Okay, and so we had a big blow up that day, and then you know we talked about it that night and talk about the next day, we met for lunch and that's about it, and you know, he was ready to just give in, he was ready to give up and. You know okay move on and then the next was like that was a Tuesday and then Thursday it happened again only he was tracking me on the phone as to where I was. OK."
527.0,Provider,"And so, and did you know, he was doing that renee network now okay."
14171.0,Patient,"No, and so i'm sitting in the drugs and he's texting me send me a picture of your desk yeah because we want to make sure it's working. yeah he's making me believe that's what he wants and so it's like i've heard back to work and did that he's like you know you're lying to me what is going on, you know who are you meeting, what are you doing. You know so that's when I realized, I had a problem. With we'd go out as a family and i'd order a couple meals and always take one home and on the excuse of well i'm just going to have it for lunch, the next day, and then I still eat it that night. Okay um so. yeah ever since then he's been he's been wonderful he's our relationship has been the best it's been years. Okay, and. You know, so this last few days with me being snippy and snappy he's been like okay what's changing what's going on with you, why are you being like this, you know. You haven't been like this for a month and now listen. You know what's happening. yeah so you know, and I try yeah I thought he explained it to him, but you know he's like you know this morning he was like you didn't tell me out that she told me, you were nervous, but you didn't tell me. You know all this other feelings that you were having about this anxiety and everything, and so you know, I have to realize that you know, even though, in my head, I may be telling him. You know this is how i'm feeling I may not be verbalizing it."
527.0,Provider,Now okay sure.
14171.0,Patient,"Sure, but you know we've we've had our ups and downs we've had a really."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14171.0,Patient,we've had a rough marriage.
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah yeah. Well, and I was gonna say to I mean certainly there's probably some anxiety about giving up these behaviors for you. You know, like How long have these behaviors been going on, you know and thinking about oh my gosh now i'm you know it's out in the open and now i'm going to be challenged to eliminate these behaviors for myself to so yeah."
14171.0,Patient,"And I you know. I guess I feel like he's you know, at first, I was like you know you're just going to sit here and track me you're just going to be, you know questioning everything I do, but you know he hasn't been doing that so. Last Friday was when my kindness happiness and snapping started. Okay, and he was. Having a discussion with our oldest who's going to be 18. Okay, and you know I felt like he was. not be not talking nicely with him not being fair to him. And so I. kind of let him know and then it's like you know I just I got to the point it's like okay I just I have, I have to leave for a while and so you know I left, and you know, of course, it was like my brain was taking me, you know you need to go get food, you need to go to. share, and you know I pulled into the. driveway of the you know del taco around the corner and. You know I. it's like the drive thru was you know pulling at me, but you know I just packed in the corner and just to close my eyes for a little bit and just thought about everything and."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14171.0,Patient,"You know, he he was he in my oldest we're trying to track my phone and they couldn't find me it looked like my phone was in the front yard, so my my oldest is out there when a flashlight looking in the back of the track and in the grass for my phone and. My husband was trying to find me so you know he he actually he tracked me down and we talked and so."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so are you are your children aware of what's going on, or how much information have you shared with them at this point renee."
14171.0,Patient,"Honestly, we haven't said anything to them yet. Okay um. You know, we just first off I you know I don't even know how to even begin to tell them."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
14171.0,Patient,"And you know they're 16 and 18 almost 18 years like two months from 18. You know it's just I don't I don't want them to. You know, constantly be worrying about me either. So we've kind of just do just kept it between my husband and myself. Sure, and you know my one of my really good friends at work and my boss knows. How come I haven't even said anything to my mom because I know if I say anything to her all she's gonna do it sit there and. Worrying and worrying worrying until she gets sick so."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure yeah.
14171.0,Patient,"You know, eight years old, like mom you just need to stay calm."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I mean which she even recognize that you've been struggling with an eating disorder for so long, or. And had issues with food. Okay, so you've been able to hide it really well. Yes, okay. What do you think your husband needs at this point, as far as just. Either education or just. understanding of what. And how he can support you right now."
14171.0,Patient,"Anything that's just basically it just you know, to understand what. What i've been going through. You know what. You know, has kind of led me down to this road as and you know ways that he can support me in ways that he can. You know, help me cope and and that I know you know, at first, he was like I have so many questions I don't even know where to begin. sure you know and it's like yeah I don't yeah I don't have the answers I don't have I have questions to you know I don't even know how all this started. You know. So I think that's the biggest thing is he's just you know if he could just get you know ways to help and support and cope, and you know so he understands, you know what what i'm feeling what i'm going through here well what i've been going through yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I guess one of my thoughts, is how are you feeling about the tracking and following and. kind of being the food police with you renee."
14171.0,Patient,"You know, overall I don't I haven't had a problem with it. You know, Friday night when he did it, it was you know I mean when they first did it that first day back in August. I was like you know how dare you, you know who do you think you are, you know. You know, but when he did it. This last Friday, it was like you know you really do care, you really you know you really want to help me through this you really want to support me through this you know it, it helped me feel better about it. You know the fact that he's willing to you know, keep making me breakfast and make me lunch and bring me a hot lunch it's like you know it's. it's again it's it's feeling, you know, like he's supporting me he's trying to do whatever he can to help me get through this without having to give me that impatient. Know going through the drive thru order you know, a ton of food."
527.0,Provider,"yeah, how do you do at home renee as far as because I know you mentioned mentioned a while back when we were talking just getting extra meals at restaurants and bringing home and then you would eat them at night, do you have any periods or episodes of night eating. Or do you typically sleep through the night."
14171.0,Patient,I don't sleep through the night but I don't.
527.0,Provider,get up and eat okay okay.
14171.0,Patient,"And you know when i'm when i'm eating with the family, I just feel like. Okay, if we're having dinner at home, I just be like."
527.0,Provider,"Normal so okay. yeah cuz I. I knew that was something else I was going to ask initially is you know if there were any times, where you were getting up and having night eating episodes because I know, sometimes that that happens, or and not really you know being present for those times either so. yeah yeah and I think probably one of the biggest things and most important things, probably will help with your husband is just understanding that it's not it's not about the food. eating disorders are not about the food, but that's. You know that's always something that the families, you know grasp onto is like just you know just eat just eat this just me, you know and. And you know they kind of get focused on the food versus really understanding what drives those behaviors so i'm trying to think there's a good book. And I always i've read it myself several times, but it's a real easy book it's called life without ED and so by Jenny shaffer and her therapist Tom rut. rutledge and that's how you pronounce it but it's a super easy read it's a it's just a walk through her eating disorder with her therapist in the book and. And I know a lot of families parents spouses. Significant others whatever loved ones they've they've read those books they've read that book as well and it just kind of helps to understand. Like that eating disorder thought process that goes through that you know that struggle in that battle and how it plays, you know how hers played out in excuse me, in her behaviors so that might be something if he's if he wants, you know, like a better understanding. of you know, an eating disorder that that's a good resource i'll try to think of think of some other ones, I know that the group is they've kind of shared resources back and forth some some of the ladies have so. But that one that one's are super easy it really kind of breaks it down and makes it really easy to understand, too, so that might be something to check into for him. I don't know how he does reading book I don't even know they may have it online to read to I don't know I think it's pretty cheap like I don't know less than 10 bucks for the books so yeah. yeah that might be something to check into she's written a couple of them that's her first one. So. yeah just thought i'd throw that out there for at least a starting point for him so. Okay yeah yeah definitely. So i'm wondering if maybe, starting with kind of backtracking as far as maybe looking at your history of behaviors and maybe things that have triggered those behaviors for yourself. Like when do you. When do you when do you think you first. noticed like issues with food or body image, or we are."
14171.0,Patient,"I mean I i've always been conscious about my weight, I mean when my my mom my my my mom and my dad divorced, when I was very young. I don't even remember them being married and then my mom remarried when I was four okay and. So I was, I became the youngest of seven. And my step dad was from the depression era where you eat everything on your plate yeah and I was always you know prior to that I was always you know, a skinny child. But then it's like he would give me what you would get everybody else, and I, I remember nights of just sitting there crying at the table at nine o'clock at night, but I was full on I couldn't eat anymore and. yeah you know it was one of those where you don't leave the table to eat."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
14171.0,Patient,"And so you know from then on it's like I gained weight i've tried out, but you know breakthrough day does diet and that diet, whatever the fat was for that time. You know, when, after we got married. I was doing Jenny Craig and my husband was working at night and. So he's late for work and i'd actually get up and go across the street from our apartment and to the donut shop, because I knew it was open, and you know i'd buy a couple donuts and go back and eat my donuts and go back to bed."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14171.0,Patient,"You know, he had no idea was doing that okay. You know, and then I mean my doctor, you know, through the years my doctors, you know finally in like 1998 she was like you know you really need to look into the gastric bypass, and I was like. you're crazy I don't need that yeah I can do it on my own, you know nevermind I was over 300 pounds, but we also I can do this, and you know, then, two years later it's like I just. made the decision it's like I had to do something if I wanted to stay alive. Sure sure and. So then, you know I had the surgery, and I didn't have a problem really with with eating then. um you know my dad made that comment and right after the surgery, and the hospital. You know, at first, he didn't want me to have surgery, he would he insisted that once I had the surgery, I was going to die, I was just killing myself."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14171.0,Patient,And I was like i'm killing myself without the searcher here.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14171.0,Patient,"And so, in that last little room they had you know the little menu thing on the nightstand table and he was like you know why do you need this you're not even anyways and it's like it's just their dad."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14171.0,Patient,"You know, and so you know I didn't really notice any other changes after that. After I had my oldest though I never really drank before that alcohol and you know, then I started drinking after I had him and. You know, after about I guess was about 10 years of drinking and getting heavier drinking heavier drinking more and more and more. um you know I again realize it's like okay there's a problem here, I need to stop, and I did I was able to just stop. And you know that was in 2010 and I haven't had any alcohol sense yeah. You know, and then. Last. It was last year. I had a also there was bleeding and I didn't know it, and my hematologist did normal blood work on me and next thing I know i'm getting a call from the era that I need to come in. Okay, my hemoglobin was so low. So I went in and they admitted me and I was treated for this whole. bleeding ulcer and everything and. When I you know I called my boss, and let him know it was a different job this I just started this job that I met now in. In March. So I let my boss know you know hey i'm in the hospital."
527.0,Provider,You know.
14171.0,Patient,"I don't know how long i'm going to be here i'll keep you updated and he made he kept making the comment to me whenever I would tell him that you know I needed to be truthful with them, because I wasn't. You know, there was no way, I was in the hospital on how can I be you know, telling them this when it's not true and. He was just accusing me of all yeah being. You know yeah and truthful with him about it. Okay until I turned in the notice from the hospital."
527.0,Provider,hospital yeah.
14171.0,Patient,But that's when I noticed this latest trend started.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14171.0,Patient,"Because it was just like you know he didn't, believe me, the stress was there I was I didn't I wasn't happy with my job anyways he started moving me from department to department. You know, he took me out of the accounting an HR area where he had me for seven years and decided to do, he was putting me in shipping. And so, his wife to do it, and so you know was just it was a really difficult time, and so I started looking for another job and at the same time that's when i'll list started, where I had to have all this food okay and. Then. You know, fast forward to now, and here we are."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so what was mom's thoughts, you know through all of that growing up, as far as just you know with with your dad and having a you know clean your plate, and you know what what was mom's mom's thoughts on all of that."
14171.0,Patient,"yeah she just went along with it, she was young, she was like you know you have to eat what's on your plate to. You know, and I know this, you know it's the older generation, and you know that's the way they were raised and everything so."
527.0,Provider,So what would happen if you didn't run a.
14171.0,Patient,You know. that's where I don't remember anything you know I don't remember what do the nights where I just couldn't eat you know I remember nights where I would finally just sit there and push all of my napkin and be like okay i'm done and stored away.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14171.0,Patient,"You know not I don't think they ever figured that out or family but I don't know. Show them, you know it would just be to be this constant cycle of you know you have to eat everything. You know my sisters, you know where the same way, you know but them tablets was a lot different than mine, so you know my middle sister was able to you know somehow her body was able to work it through, but. Now mine."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah yeah did you guys ever talk about that you know his siblings or with your sisters or. No okay.
14171.0,Patient,"And you know now they both passed so it's like I have to do whatever I can to try and take care of myself now because you know i'm the only one, my mom has left now so."
527.0,Provider,What was what was the dinner table like or just or breakfast you know meal table I should say. What was kind of the the feelings that that you had with mealtimes.
14171.0,Patient,"um I mean I would I would be looking forward to eating unless it was you know something that I didn't like liver and onions was like. Please, can I just go to bed now.
