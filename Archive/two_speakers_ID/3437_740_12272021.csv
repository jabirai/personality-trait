740.0,Provider,"master was convicted, but apparently. I have everything going."
3437.0,Patient,"it's going great i'm currently in. In Vancouver Canada, right now, the US having a great great great vacations. awesome after the Semester so aside from the fact that it's so colon here it's minus a degree Celsius and it's snowing everywhere."
740.0,Provider,well.
3437.0,Patient,"Aside from that, everything else is great yes."
740.0,Provider,i'm glad to hear that I know the last time we spoke was probably on the first. The first of December. So what. what's been going on since been.
3437.0,Patient,"um so. As mentioned, I finished the finals. The results are great like much greater than expected. So, even though with and also have been taking medication regularly every day. So it may have been the proof that, even though there were some difficulties with. The intake of medication, it makes my brain a little bit slower, I still. I still finished. Better. um yeah so it means that it makes me think that I can really continue with this and to make everything better, not just. You know. Right, not just the mental side."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, that's good. that's really, really good i'm happy i'm happy to hear that i'm so glad everything well. And that's your final and that your grade A feature expectations which is amazing, and so what they let you know is that you are able to retain information. And that, even though you may have to listen to things multiple times and that you may have to play it back and you may have to go the extra mile in order to retain or in order to understand something it doesn't mean that you're not able to comprehend it so that's a good thing."
3437.0,Patient,"Yes, thank you."
740.0,Provider,"that's a good thing, I know that's one of the thing that you are really concerned about initially when we met. Regarding one of one of your hardships being able to take taking a lot, it takes a long time for you to retain things in bed, you have to listen to things multiple times and he said that other people. would only have to listen to the lecture one time, and then they would get it today, for you, we will take multiple times and fund so you talked about wanting to be a fit for ADHD and autism and things like that, however. It sounds like that you were still able to buckle down and to pass everything so that's a good thing."
3437.0,Patient,it's really a great thing.
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, how was your holiday."
3437.0,Patient,Oh wow it's going it's going very well so. it's been a week since I arrived in Canada. been resting the hard times.
740.0,Provider,"I know that's right oh my gosh there's nothing there's less than like it okay being able to be away from home and to be able to read it to sleep so that's really good So how have. amy bipolar manic episode me a proposal, maybe or anything. like that, no, no. yeah."
3437.0,Patient,"don't yes yeah just simply by removing all the stressors in life. Everything went. Well, and here I hope that I can keep this up for a little while. Before the Semester starts, which is the middle of January. it's gonna be crazy all over again."
740.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so I mean let's let's talk about that, today, so what what are some things that you are putting in place, knowing that knowing what your stressors are knowing what i'm. What those what those triggers are and knowing i'm just being overwhelmed with so much schooling and having a way that you learn and how and the way that you repay what are some things and plans, I would say, they should put in place. To try to. get ahead. Of. The strength. and make them better."
3437.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, so for starter and thinking or not thinking, I already start. preparing for the next semesters like there are classes that. That I can prepare in terms of. Reading beforehand, all of the materials and to to get a good foundation before the Semester even started that's one. number two is i'm thinking about. temporarily stop my part time work to spend more time with school. And to to have more time for myself for once. And also. I will try my best to eat and sleep properly. huh yes yeah because sometimes when I. When I grind and. When I grind through. The classes trying to. Prepare. As much as I can, before the exam sometimes I forgot to eat or to sleep, or even both. After that that would feel so. Low in terms of energy and it's going to be hard to. recharge and. move forward from there, so. i'll try to keep a habit. In terms of eating and sleeping. In terms of. resting properly. per se, yes."
740.0,Provider,"Okay well that's really good do you outside of sleeping do you feel like you need to change up some of your study regiments, but do you feel like you need to join, like the 30 group or. try to get assistance. somewhere else."
3437.0,Patient,"Yes. Oh, in terms of study group I don't have any trouble getting into one. i've been doing that regularly throughout multiple semesters so well that won't be an issue. um. So yeah."
740.0,Provider,"What it sounds like. It sounds like you do have a plan. um so. Which is the good thing, and so I guess, I would say. More fell. to really be careful. and try to. Work on. Employee implementing good sleep pattern. eat eating patterns. sleep hygiene like your actual routing I know it's difficult when you're in college. We have a study out of time, I think things like that. But to try to implement a routine because the thing about it is, is that the stress and the strain in school. um can actually. trigger. Your bipolar episodes."
3437.0,Patient,"And all eat and even though. It. Well it's um. Even though there is a plan. i'm still a little bit fearful of what is going to happen. Because, sometimes even though you want to sleep at that exact same time you find it hard to sleep in when it comes. If you know if you. were so focusing. Earlier, sometimes I would find myself hard. To come down and actually sleep it's going to take like a lot of time to work, and I would end up sleeping later and that isn't like time. The same thing and we say about eating. take some time I would feel so tired and also. side effect of the medications it makes my stomach turn a little bit. yeah. So I hope. finger cross. That. I won't encounters so many. trouble executing the plans."
740.0,Provider,"wet wet wet trouble whatsoever, do you see, they could possibly exist with you trying to execute a plan like What do you do. Just asking more so. What are some of the way flakes or some of the things that you. or hindrances the obstacles that you see can hinder you from executing they play it."
3437.0,Patient,"Yes. Sometimes. Sometimes I would have to. to pull the nights. To meet a deadline, and that would mean that I would have to sacrifice all of the sleeping hours. And it will be an issue. yeah I would have to carry that tireless moving forward that whole week. And it's kind of pile up. yeah. Even though sometimes when I want some time I wanted to finish everything on time but. I guess i'm doing things slowly. and I would end up. Having I would ever having to sacrifice sleeping hours to meet a deadline. And sometimes. yeah. That is one thing. One of the most scariest things I guess."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. I can see. Why, they can be the scariest thing is trying to compile everything to make sure that you're meeting your deadlines and meetings and Simon dates and things like that. One thing I will say. is, of course, with a plan in place and with the idea that you have in place in with the measures that you have in place dealing with. sleep hygiene eating regularly. utilizing. tutorial programs tutorial groups. And things of that nature. Basically kind of taking. I guess more so, taking it low not putting too much pressure on yourself that's what I want to say. Because also adding a lot of pressure can also a stress. And can cause you to be overwhelmed it can cause. It can cause you to be to have self defeating behaviors and things have been major and so what are some stress relievers what is something. That you feel like you can do outside of school to help relieve your stress."
3437.0,Patient,I surprisingly I can't think of any.
740.0,Provider,Okay. So let's come up with them. What are some things you like to do.
3437.0,Patient,"And that's the problems. I have no idea. Because. it's almost as if. My identity is tied with how well I doing in what I do. yeah I don't think they have. I have any recreational life outside of that. And because I. Think, I spent all my times. and doing the work that i'm supposed to do. yeah I have no idea how to answer that question sorry."
740.0,Provider,"So no it's fine because that's something that needs to happen, though right, you need to be able to implement some self care. Right so like say it, like, for example, even what you want to Canada. Even when she went to Canada and evil what you're doing what you're doing. resting and relaxing and enjoying the sights and scenery and things like that I think is the best part of self care so. Ill um. So if those. I guess more so if you're able to. If you're able to. I guess most of you're able to find things that you can do. To help you relax when you're at school that's what we that's what needs to happen if that means i'm going for a walk if that means i'm going to the if if that means i'm going fishing or that means i'm going to watch it go into the movies. This a fair ate a big old fat bag of popcorn and some juju be and what laws drink and just sit there and watch a movie I mean it's just finding something you know i'm saying finding something to help you relax finding something to. To just kind of real an outlet for relief because schools are really stressful right and. School is already stressful enough, and so I understand that you not having that outlet, they can also add. to you all for you may be having problems being able to retain. Because your brain can be on overload. So. Maybe just something to consider."
3437.0,Patient,Yes.
740.0,Provider,"finding new thing is not even new thing is just doing things for yourself. Right, so the point to where. you're able to relax outside of school. If there's going on a desk taking yourself the DEMO. If there's getting them with batch if there's going for gun range on now, whatever you. That you like to do if you don't know what you like to do. If you don't know what you like to do, then the beautiful part about it is you can try. You can try it on so that you can figure out what you do like to do."
3437.0,Patient,"Okay, do you mind sharing, what is it for you to do in terms of that, I mean outside of work, what did you do."
740.0,Provider,"me oh. i'm so happy. So I have a six month old baby. mama mama and I have my wife, but for myself, I had I got to workout class it's like a. it's like a crossfit type hit play I do they I like to go there is 6am in the morning that's something that I do for myself, I love going there love it. So i'll take a class in the morning and that's up another for me, believe it or not, grocery shopping is a beautiful thing that I love to do. cooking is a stress reliever for me I love to cook. going out of town like you're doing right now I love doing that. as well is. Going like the concert and stuff like that I love it I love going fishing. We have a place here in Dallas called topped off. And going golfing I love doing that. So stuff like that these are things that I do. I can't do them all the time, but one thing I do do all the time, I do go to my six eight and play. Like I can't do nothing now I got a master's day and play like I have to make sure i'm doing something for me each day does that make sense. And so that's something I want you to do I want you to do something for you, if that just means going on a bike ride if they're just me going to the lake and going walking or whatever, as long as you're doing something for you each day. Okay. And so that's just something I want you to try, between now and our next session I want you to at least try to look into doing things it doesn't have to be big and. stuff like they don't have enough that you don't say it could just be something it could just be something just just trying out different things, and then be like all I do is, I think I can do this on a regular basis. If that's even listening to music and reading a book on the beach. When they listen to music and read a book on the beach or going to a lake and sitting on the bench and reading a book or allowing the audio book The place why you look at the site when you read. It just finding something to kind of take your mind away from skool skool skool skool method and papers final this, and this, you know lectures and I became a fellow and then hopefully better kind of having that having that resource and having that outlet. will help you be able to reduce being aware of a reduce the stress."
3437.0,Patient,"Yes, I understand."
740.0,Provider,"What else, what do you think."
