16466.0,Patient,"Doing Okay, making it through. all over the place. um yeah it's it's I won't lie, I was kind of counting down the Minutes till till this till this appointment because last last week or so it's been kind of tough. On you know, obviously with with the last couple of weeks, really, I mean with holidays and everything coming up on, you know mines race and you know is it's been hard to kind of slow myself down."
298.0,Provider,"Do you find that you're cycling at all, or you just remember we've talked before that you're naturally at a high level."
16466.0,Patient,"yeah um you know it feels it feels like i've been at a much lower level for a much longer period of time that i'm that I used to also I mean being on disability for a month and a half i'm sure has a lot to do with that i'm used to staying busy and and everything but um yeah it's it's. If i'm being honest I mean i'll be scrolling social media and i'm having i'm just convinced that the things are talking to me. Whether it's ads or other, you know other people's coasts things like that I try to I try to you know make time without my phone with it, but then the anxiety just really starts to climb. On when I tried to get my mind off it with video games or movies, you know things things that I firmly i'm super passionate about I just I can't focus, because I just always have this constant anxiety that just kind of won't let let my brain relax so that makes sense."
298.0,Provider,I don't know now. Down we went down significantly on your medicine didn't we.
16466.0,Patient,um we did we went from was it the depakote from the I know we started at three times a day 250 milligrams now i'm not just the 250 a day. i'm taking it at night.

16466.0,Patient,"We did, and then I if i'm not mistaken, after our last session, I think the risperidone was cut out and we're just doing that, once a day i'm depakote but i'm I could go off, but."
298.0,Provider,"and Do you miss it, I mean remember you were kind of in a fog you felt like you were in a fog."
16466.0,Patient,"Yet what I really miss and I hate saying this because I knew I was buying you to listen to ever really misses the Admiral I. really need some sort of offense just something to focus all the stuff that's always blasting out of my head. Because, at least that allowed me to be much more effective and kept my my moods at a much, much better level on it, and I was, I was, I was. it's tough for me to get anything around here done because i'm noticing things on the way to go, do stuff and next thing you know i'm wearing a hole in my floor over half $1 rather than actually getting stuff done and just facing and anxious."
298.0,Provider,"And the problem with adderall is it can. It can trip of bipolar into mania. So that's that's a struggle, but I did tell I vaguely remember telling you I would put you on adderall if you handle being off of. Your man, am I, making that up or did I tell you that."

298.0,Provider,it'll be interesting for me to see how you respond.
16466.0,Patient,"yeah you know I mean i'm I pride myself on being a pretty focused relatively educated individual, and you know the the The spiral that this whole situation has been has been very revealing for myself as well you know I am enjoying getting to. learn about who I am and what I react to you. But, but the the the grow the growing pains are more pain and growing sometimes so I appreciate your work."
298.0,Provider,You know um. I don't know why but i'm I definitely feel empathic that if I were in your situation and I were ADHD and I was wearing a hole in the carpet that would. drive me NUTS yeah.
16466.0,Patient,"Thank you, yes costs claustrophobia is not fun and it feels like that, sometimes, so I appreciate you understanding."
298.0,Provider,"I may understand I just may not be treating this the right way, so that's why we have to communicate."
16466.0,Patient,"This, this is a treatment plan that I can get behind for sure so yeah."
298.0,Provider,"OK. OK Tyler is there anything else, I can do for you."
16466.0,Patient,"know so so, how would we go about obtaining the prescription is it just sent to my pharmacy and then I."
298.0,Provider,"sent to your pharmacy, but a lot of times instantly. The insurance company will deny it. And what you do is you go to bright heart health and you say, I would like to open a prior authorization for by Vance so my insurance. will pay for it and they'll know exactly what you're talking to and then remember the squeaky wheel gets the grease check in on it."
16466.0,Patient,"Okay yeah let me i'm that's one of my weaker point, so I would love to write that info down from you, so you said insurance may be denied initially."
298.0,Provider,Most likely.
16466.0,Patient,"Okay, they denied by Vance it, what was the dosage, by the way, or do we do yeah."
298.0,Provider,i'm put I put it at 40 milligrams.
16466.0,Patient,"Okay awesome. Okay, and then, and then I would need to call bright heart."
298.0,Provider,"yeah once the once the pharmacy says to you, oh your insurance needs to have a prior authorization we're going to send this to your doctor I never see it. And then the prescription department will open up a claim, and they will do it from there, and it can take up to five days to get it now, maybe there's something that your insurance will pay for it right away, and you won't have to do that nightmare."
16466.0,Patient,"This year. Oh yeah okay yeah as long as I can get it in hand and then figure out the reimbursement or whatever else later that'd be awesome but in your in your estimation, did you know, he said he could take up to five days from from today you're thinking probably."
298.0,Provider,"Probably Monday, because it's already 351 you could. You could do a little phone work, you could call the pharmacy and they say no, your insurance. won't pay for it, then you call bright heart health and say, would you open up and I don't know it. Then you the clock starts at that point."
16466.0,Patient,"Okay, that seems simple enough okay cool. um, then I think we're all set doctor."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, take care of chantel. ya bye."
