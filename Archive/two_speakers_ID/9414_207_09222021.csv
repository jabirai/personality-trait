207.0,Provider,"It you know I think it's a you know it comes down to how things are communicated, because the truth be told, is that. You know, as a parent yourself you're always going to want to tell a younger person, you know what to do and how to do things but it's allowing it's like hey, allow me to set my own presence, allow me to figure things out, allow me to. Allow me to solicit."
9414.0,Patient,"problem I think his mom is like trying to make up for like like his grandparents practically raised him like you know what I mean like and I don't know if this is her way of like trying to like redeem herself, or what."
207.0,Provider,"Does ultimately what it comes down to it, and that's a good assessment, it is what it comes down to some time you know once I wasn't if I wasn't there now they tried to redeem us so through the grandchildren and they feel like."
9414.0,Patient,"it's kind of like, though, like he's not like. Like his great grandmother like like liam's great grandmother she's great with him, but like. She get so stuck on doing like one thing with him. And like she's more interactive with him and like his mom like gives me my phone and says here like play a game and that like it's kind of like he wants their attention you know what I mean more than that, and it just like it's like what the hell you're doing. To talk to him, he doesn't want you to be like here here's a phone here's a TV here's this stuff like."
207.0,Provider,The.
9414.0,Patient,"Free like he's only going to happen December, so I mean. he's just now started like communicating very well, but it's like. I don't know if you like, even teases his grandma because grandma now Sammy memo. You don't like that very much. I just don't know. What."
207.0,Provider,She calls the grandmother that.
9414.0,Patient,"Oh yeah he calls his grandma that hey teases everybody my kid does. I don't know if it's his way of just like. I don't know be loving or what it is, but like he teased that everybody will walk up to people and go to. intrude on them. And the family, he thinks it's funny, though."
207.0,Provider,"that's why he keeps doing it because they think. The behavior merely directive is that you laugh when you said oh you're a kid and so he thinks okay it's Okay, and he doing."
9414.0,Patient,Help when he comes over here like they reinforce that.
207.0,Provider,They.
9414.0,Patient,are like reinforce certain behaviors and then becomes over here that's like a big job. and I don't think a lot of it's very funny because i'm going to go to school and do that and i'm going to get.
207.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly so you know it's one thing to. um. it's one thing to think something is cute and acceptable in one instance and it's not but then it can be understand when it's Okay, and when it's not when funny when it's not worth doing and we're."
9414.0,Patient,"yeah that's exactly what i'm trying to say like whoa like you know he's gonna. i'm going to be a barrier. And then, like. I don't even know how i'm going to talk to them, because I try to tell them like you can't be doing this stuff like one of these days, get up to go to school and it's just like Oh, but that's right that's like you know down the road like it's not that far down the road like. it's like right now we're trying to do potty training and it's like he'd rather come over here and use the bathroom that our own House. Like over here like. I think he maybe had like. I mean, I still have him in diapers but that's good his mom literally told me Rochelle like. To I don't have a washer and dryer because I didn't do my laundry over here. And then. And literally like like laying run around without a diaper on Am I you just like he owns and i'm like are you kidding me like."
207.0,Provider,I have placing she think. Why do you think she's saying that.
9414.0,Patient,"Because that's, the only way to potty train kids."
207.0,Provider,"That is the i've heard i've heard of that one concept is that because it's not so much it's that's, the only way it's because of the feeling of being wet. And when they don't like the feeling, then they will say they will learn to then i've heard of another concept of like if you listen to watch some TV during the day. That heard of taking the potty. Then there's another kind of."
9414.0,Patient,What I do is I asked him I go baby don't need to go the bathroom I he'll come up to me Rochelle straight up as you guys they can't tell that he went with that diaper on I was like full that is both that he will walk right up to me and look at yourself and go away.
207.0,Provider,"But what you want, what you wanted to get to the point of not actually. doing it in the diagram saying that he's what because you're right at three years old, if he was already they would they would already want him to be potty trained. yeah like every time that he goes to the bathroom they also said lesson go with it. So learn."
9414.0,Patient,yeah I go the bathroom and he comes with me and goes to the ball.
207.0,Provider,"yeah or when in or have the party there, so you know that he backs, and you, even if he doesn't have to have him sit on it. Or if you know you gave him something to drink two hours later, put it on there, so he will learn what i've heard that I mean I was never the biggest orange some people will get underwear and put them in underwear. yo P in the underwear, yes, but ultimately, if he doesn't like that feeling then it's going to say Okay, if you don't like it, then you gotta go to the toilet. So people have tried many different yes. I mean, I personally never liked the whole Washington hundred underwear the de. facto under. Or how many underwear do I have to buy for me to do that."
9414.0,Patient,"i'm not a washer and dryer Rochelle like. me have to come over here and, like him, his grandma making like such a big deal over."
207.0,Provider,It.
9414.0,Patient,"it's like well then, what the hell, you want me to do."
207.0,Provider,It.
9414.0,Patient,"This way, but then you're not giving me the resources to be able to come over and watch it don't do it that way."
207.0,Provider,"yeah no I mean that's The only thing is, like, I never really liked the idea of that I was an undergrad they're not cheap. So now we'll buy a. ton of underwear and then has been P and and all the time, I mean, but then, what if he is a kid who doesn't care if you want."
9414.0,Patient,You know that's.
207.0,Provider,that's not gonna work.
9414.0,Patient,"That kid like every once in a while like now he'll like there were a little bit in the diaper before, but then he'll go mommy, we need to go in like straight to the bathroom like you know. Baby I was like you need to stop doing this, I was like you know now I was like you know when you have to go, I was like come on like we go the bathroom, we need to go now."
207.0,Provider,You know if you're putting on it pulled up I know they say pull up a way to do the part and I think Philip doesn't really necessarily have because. it's just easier way to take it on and off and so on and so forth.
9414.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"The end of the day, if it's it's finding different so you have him on a sketch so like if they're in school they're on a schedule."
9414.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"If they're in school that age, they close to that every so often, so they line them up and they go to the bathroom every so often. So that's that's another way to having him or you know at this time, this time, this time that he's going to go to the bathroom and then you can get you can put on underwear on him. But then have a schedule. When he wakes up he put on that he uses the bathroom usually, when they wake up, they have to use the bathroom so you put on. put on the prologue let him use the bathroom and then. Let him use the bathroom and then i'm. You know, getting something to eat wait two hours later, let me the bathroom again, then you know, and you kind of time, but I know in the school in the daycare they have them do it every so many hours. yeah, and so they, the only time that I, I know that they may have accidentally when it's not time. During that time is when they have the accident."
9414.0,Patient,But really he's not he's at the point he doesn't do that anymore unless like we've had like a really busy day and we're running around a lot. We don't do enough.
207.0,Provider,"All kids are different but in terms of the park because he's if he's three three and a half, that means that he should be probably eligible to start regular school next year for preschool."
9414.0,Patient,"Well, it really depends on like what's going on with just totally situation for us because I mean we don't want him to get this again and the problem is is the more that he grows, the more his kidney function is going to decrease. So. we're worried about him going in and you know all these other kids and people send their kids to school sick and then. You know, with him having this disease us more susceptible to getting sick because of the immune system is compromised and we're actually thinking you know, maybe about homeschooling."
207.0,Provider,And I remember you that maybe it's the you know what certain things if he were homeschooling. You wouldn't have to worry about.
9414.0,Patient,"full time with the now it's not gonna I mean my cousin did that, and you know what she did she took the kids to church she had them enrolled in sports they weren't you know segregated from you know other children."
207.0,Provider,"and other children yeah. yeah the whole. it's a whole thing. You know, in their arm hateful. it's a whole thing, but I, you know. But you could start on trying to the different ways of course what works for you, with the potty training it really all comes down to what works for you and and how it's affected for you."
9414.0,Patient,"yeah I wouldn't you doing Okay, but we've been we've been using within you the Pole and diapers you know, just in case. cuz I don't want him to stay in there, you know P nine so no P, and all over my house like i'm sorry i'm just like oh hell no this ain't happening. i've already got a dog puppet that like. If you don't pay attention to her, she destroys our entire House."
