14352.0,Patient,"I will collection representative i've been here for three years, so it kind of sucks because I talked to people that you know get their car repaired and stuff so i'm not bad person, but i'm a nice representative so it's hard, sometimes, but you know good."
300.0,Provider,"guys yeah it's it's I would say that that sounds like a really hard job. But, but if you think about it, like you know everything is kind of how we spin it or how we look at it and in one per."
14352.0,Patient,Se like.
300.0,Provider,"hey Thank God it's me helping these people out rather than someone who, maybe is more callous or doesn't care. Like okay well i'm making a difference. Even if it's small police i'm being kind you know i'm sure a. Little more intimidating or whatever."
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, they get in your ear very."
300.0,Provider,"Very good i'm sure you're not one of those so that's good. But it's still stressful Okay, and in terms of MED control remind me about your psychiatrist who is it."
14352.0,Patient,"It was sharing stents. Okay okay so yeah. And the connie's, on the other, bottles i'm not sure, but she was one that I was talking to."
300.0,Provider,got it okay um so after sharing you did see Connie said.
14352.0,Patient,I know there's makati I don't know if there was a McCartney Dr mcconnell my other bottle and then sharing steps I think she prescribed my seroquel and then my child left always makati but Sharon says is one that I talked to you face to face. yeah.
300.0,Provider,And um did you request to go down on the dose or what's the plan with.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, I wanted to request it goes down because I don't know I just like don't want to rely like on pills i've never been on pills ever until now, and I feel like i'm more. Doing my old habits like dancing writing again, you know being distracted and going outside walking things like that, so I just want to like go down, and especially with my Sarah for the one my sleeping mode like. I like it and i'm like it's good man, I just want to like go down on it just so I don't have to like rely on it forever, but i'm okay with taking meds now. Now so yeah."
300.0,Provider,"Well, and I think what's the healthy approach because yeah I mean ultimately the ideal is that you get to a point where you know, these were there for you during times of struggle, but then you kind of get the support and get the new perspective that you need to see."
14352.0,Patient,Right So yes.
300.0,Provider,"You know what I mean. Yes, more long lasting and it's more life changing then okay well forever i'm going to have."
14352.0,Patient,write and Julie lenhart she was my therapist and like she told me like you know it's kind of like getting. your mind out of the dirt road and going on to like a new path and I always thought of it that way now it's like okay like just thinking of different ways to train your mind.
300.0,Provider,"that's really what it is, so I think if you see it that way, and you push yourself to do that, then yeah lets you rely on other things, the better you'll feel."
14352.0,Patient,The exact.
300.0,Provider,"Science it's not as high maintenance so like. Groups and these visits and things like that you know, obviously we want it to be helpful for you and i'm sure it."
14352.0,Patient,is right.
300.0,Provider,after a certain time and can be a little bit stressful too because of financial burden or whatever.
14352.0,Patient,You know right yeah definitely.
300.0,Provider,"So, so what so tell me what's going on with that and what you'd like to do moving forward like what do you think what are you envisioning."
14352.0,Patient,"um I don't know I I like the program we have here, but like I rather do more, one on one therapy, I know that I talked to sharing a partnership with that's how our program works like you have to you know go group. And group group every week and it's teacher therapist, but I wanted to be one one on one, so I was trying to find a new provider and everything and all that but. But the medicine, I feel like i'm good right now what i'm taking one in the morning and one night and I kind of want to slowly go down on the seroquel but I really liked my mood stabilizer one so um yeah that's just where i'm at I guess. awesome awesome."
300.0,Provider,um and then so so the group that you had been in. Is now the therapist running it with me.
14352.0,Patient,is OK.
300.0,Provider,"So there's a new therapist her name is Lisa. Lisa she um she sees were you seeing manny at all, did you ever see manny what."
14352.0,Patient,"i'm honestly, the reason why I didn't. attend group so much was because honestly I just didn't have the finances and, of course, like i've read like all these other bills, so I was like I can't spend $160 a month on this and, like, I really like it, I do like I just don't have the finances I just. don't so now that i'm finally working, and again I think I could keep on track with the group therapy and you know go to my one on one so."
300.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm thinking and then you know rosie we have I know bright heart health has like scholarships and. Aid and stuff like that, so we can even like see I can ask the Karen as to look into it and see. Maybe, for your region, it depends on the region, I think that we get."
14352.0,Patient,scholar hey.
300.0,Provider,"Maybe there's some help we could give you like Oh, you know some. Any help you know."
14352.0,Patient,Okay i'll look into that yeah.

300.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'll email you again this. Okay want and it's an open door like you can join or you can just kind of, not the other option we can do is you know we can reduce your frequency, so you can say. Okay yeah we can cater to you, so if you're like you know what I, I want to meet with Lisa the therapist. One on one on a weekly basis or I want to meet with her every two weeks, you can."
14352.0,Patient,Do that okay.
300.0,Provider,"We can arrange it and then like the groups, you can be like hey I really liked the group spot. And Lisa runs the groups now, so you could. be like. i'll do the groups, how about I do the groups every two weeks or every three weeks, you know. Yes, Lisa can negotiate and like change the frequency so you're not an every week or if you don't need."
14352.0,Patient,"Okay yeah cuz like I like fruit, but like sometimes I just feel like. I already know kind of what to do, not that it's against anyone or anything it's just my personal opinion, like I just rather be more one on one you can dig more deeper into like. You know yourself and everything and like I love learning from other people I just feel like one on one it's just more better for me so i'm definitely going to look into I didn't know that we could. switch it up so okay."
300.0,Provider,"switch it up, so I say take you know i'm empowering you to do that to like. Yes, and Lisa is a new therapist with us so she may kind of not know exactly, but I can tell you, for sure, and you have."
