741.0,Provider,"And I don't think anybody with. You and then gentleman right before you have consistently had this time and I don't think anybody i'll take it. And so it works just fine.

8308.0,Patient,"Well, I ran a test today that's why I got on your early this morning, if I got a test here before work well right right when I get into work. And then hopefully she can give me good props on. Give me in through this test it's like it's um where. Somebody else it's not the Members calling in but it's like somebody that that's like that knows that i'm in training and they take a phone call and they make it like I take their phone call, and I might get like there's a member, but they're not you know diane. As like oh my God. Right i'm all fail. i've been doing pretty good on. i'm with i'm with doing it in class but glasses all different than when i'm with somebody else then i'm afraid i'm will mess up but i've got to start. I gotta sort where i'm trying to hurry and rush through it. And they take my time."
741.0,Provider,"Right right. So let's work on a couple of things that help that might help with that okay. The first thing is, you need to remember that it's just one little step at a time. Okay, and that the other thing too is you need to do some deep breathing before you start your tasks before you start on that because it will help relieve the anxiety okay. Okay, if you take breaths and you inhale for for and then hold for four and then exhale for for and hold for for okay and pay really. Close attention and you may not be able to do it yeah you're a smoker so you may have to do it for three and a Count of three."
8308.0,Patient,Instead of four I do. For you.
741.0,Provider,"And, but feel the love the air expand your lungs pay attention to how it feels in your lungs. And then feel what it feels like to have your lungs squeeze out all the air and pay close attention to the physical feelings. That will. Help relax your body. It will also help you focus. So that will give you a calming sensation Okay, then you can focus on the questions that you're supposed to ask your customer. And then just take one thing at a time just let it kind of unfold your it's not a time test is it."
8308.0,Patient,"No, no i'm. Okay, you gotta let Tom as the client, as I have as much time as what the Member, you know the Members go on there for me. And i'm the one that's protected given getting the information for them, so it can take me as much time as you know, as I want you know."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's no need to be in a hurry. So that relaxed state just maintain that if you have to stop and breathe that stop and breathe a couple of times and then go back. Okay okay see if that helps you get through the tasks without so much stress okay. Okay Okay, did you happen to work on the worksheet."
8308.0,Patient,"i've got it written down in my book, but I haven't I haven't worked on all of them, yet i've got none, but."
741.0,Provider,"Okay well that's fine that's progress that's all that's, all I can expect this for you to try just a couple of them."
8308.0,Patient,"And i've been working weekends, you know, since we've been. Doing this. I haven't in this room we're getting ready to do the same call today and it's been it's been hectic you know with me working every day."

8308.0,Patient,You know time to take care of the House and the.
741.0,Provider,"kids and all that. yeah that's right because you still have to have some downtime. So that makes sense. That that's awesome yeah you're taking care of yourself and that sounds really good that sounds really good. So, what are you doing to relax after work."
