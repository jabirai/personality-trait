11958.0,Patient,Hello.
226.0,Provider,How are you.
11958.0,Patient,i'm doing okay.
226.0,Provider,I guess yeah. What happened what's going on.
11958.0,Patient,"um well not Okay, so I think it has to do a lot with I you know, I was watching dogs this past weekend. I was how sitting for the people that adopted the last two dogs that I had to get rid of the one that I like really found it hard to part with who they had adopted his sister remember so. I. got to house slash baby slash dog sit. For them i'm on Friday till Sunday, and so I got to spend money back my mom just got married. So I got to spend my whole weekend with them and. Like it was just really nice I got to. put on my pup. It was kind of annoying like I had to not necessarily well yeah like I guess the kids expected me to, for some reason, take care of them to. The mom has given me like $20 and said here's for each of my kids which I thought was like payment on top. The money she gave me to watch like the dogs. And, but then like kids kept coming and asking me like if i'm if their mom left them money you're like if they can get. Their $20 so I was just like I just gave them 20 bucks like. And then they the girl I think she has. A dd or ADHD or something cuz I happen to find an adderall till. The bathroom counter. Like but what was annoying is like there were a lot of animals in that house and like cats, especially that jump on top of cameras like it was right next to the cat bowl that was sitting on the counter."
226.0,Provider,as well.
11958.0,Patient,"Like the in the cows like sniffing at it and piling at it and that's what drew my attention and. Closer I was like I know what that is all too well, but. Like I didn't take any. One one improvement. and other. yeah like I wasn't it was funny because I. Obviously, like couldn't help but think you know, there was a day, where I would have been like wow I stone cold. And I did not have that feeling whatsoever. All right now."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11958.0,Patient,"Anyway, so I was pretty proud of myself for that one I was like good like obviously it's not just like you're keeping yourself out of those situations if those situations happen to come your way, at least, I know that I, you know i'm strong enough and. What it wasn't even anything I needed to fight I I just like. Like my curiosity ended at what. What it was I didn't want to explore any further, but like it was just annoying again because of animals in that house and then the kids were just they were teenagers but. They were just really annoying and they hated each other, it was a sister and a brother, and so they just were like bickering. Any interaction that they would have like if I said, can you ask your brother, if he wants food or something like that, like. It would just like turn into a huge thing I saw the dog chewing on one of her makeup brushes and I was like oh my God was that in his mouth. And the sun was like Oh, what is that oh that's one of vivian's things she should know better than to leave them around so just leave it. i'm like What do you mean just leave it get it out that's not the dog's fault, the Vivian is irresponsible and stuff around like it out of the dog's mouth. But then it was just so like. As fun, as it was that I got to spend that time with my pups and I have like a million pictures and he was just so sweet but, like the other thing that concerned me was he was very, very, very like not about meeting anybody knew. You would mark it literally because I had to take him I had to take both of them to the dog events with me on Saturday, because I had another little yorkie terrier with me, that was getting adopted so I had to drive all the way from fullerton to. True buco like mission viejo area. I don't know. orange county South orange county."
226.0,Provider,yeah somewhat.
11958.0,Patient,"So, like that was an hour drive each way. And I got the dogs their vaccinations, too, because they needed like one more booster for some reason. And also. I took them, you know pudgy the dog that was getting adopted, but these two dogs that I had to take with me barked the entire time they just wouldn't settle down, they were freaking out. And like. I would step on their site, they would freak out and even the ladies that were all there when they first came to us as tiny little pub that we fit in our hands. Even those ladies couldn't calm them down like and I was the only one that they would you know. They would allow near them so i'm like this is concerning you know, and I told the owners, when I saw them they got back on Sunday and i'm like we definitely need to get him some will be able to I feel like he instigates it she like gets more scared because he's barking. And he's not you she kind of will go and wanting to explore. and see what's going on. So i'm like I feel like for him it's more urgent that we find a solution to this but. Hopefully, nothing about it, but the fact that it's not even my dog and i've already spent like 15. Other people's dogs is probably concerning, for me, but I miss him so much like I really like every second that I spent. Like just cuddling with him and holding him and he just like he literally all he wants to do is being near me the whole car ride like. He had to scoop as close as he could to me until Finally, the tip of his nose and the tip of his pot, on one hand, was touching like my thigh. And then he settled down on the car ride, it was the cutest friggin thing i've ever seen, and like I just. I feel really, really sad, I think, like when yesterday I couldn't even get out of bed my moms like standing over me like don't why one ever going to be normal why like why can't you get it together why can't like wanting to make my life easy."
226.0,Provider,way.
11958.0,Patient,"Or, just like already laying here with all those same thoughts going through my head. Like I don't want to have any answer you'll be the first to."
226.0,Provider,Tell me why you think you've been in bed.
11958.0,Patient,"Like I have zero motivation, like, I have the patience and i'll get up and i'll have expert motivation, where. i'm like. Okay, unless I do something I know nothing's gonna happen, so I have to do something and all like. look into the you know, a couple of mine. pieces of mail that I needed to look into you know i'll make some phone calls if I needed to me. That that's it I haven't even really looked at john because. For one I was like busy this weekend, so I didn't even like literally did nothing for myself the entire time you'll see the dogs are their kids but. Before that no not really depressed."
226.0,Provider,"All right, are you on an antidepressant."
11958.0,Patient,I. I stopped taking it.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, what what what were you taking."
11958.0,Patient,toxicity.
226.0,Provider,Why did.
11958.0,Patient,"I think, Sarah trailing."
226.0,Provider,Tell me why.
11958.0,Patient,"I just like I couldn't. I honestly couldn't. tell the difference. Okay um. And then, not just that my prescription for some reason got lost or got like confused at the pharmacy for a good like month and I didn't have access to it until they like, finally figure out, I think, because. I was getting it from one doctor and then Sean called decided to take over."
226.0,Provider,that's right.
11958.0,Patient,And like it cause some kind of interruption so.
226.0,Provider,um. I was.
11958.0,Patient,Like What if I should just start keeping it again it seems 60 milligram.
226.0,Provider,"here's what I here's what I suggest. hey here's what I suggest is that you set an appointment with shontelle an individual to go over this it's not working, it wasn't working it might not be the right medication for you, you might need a higher dose. Talk to her about it because I think what's happening like what i'm seeing is that you are experiencing, you are experiencing depression. Not being able to get out of bed, that is a number one indicator of depression, you have a very difficult situation anyways your living situation is very challenging. So."
11958.0,Patient,"Right, for that reason I thought of right now and I went and I made like a piece of toast and pour myself a glass of milk I threw in a load of laundry which I have to actually go and start. And then I changed the water filter in our refrigerator, which is something my mom asked me if she also has to take care of yesterday, so I wanted to take care of it before. She actually didn't. She sees that I did that and. Maybe miss it for."
226.0,Provider,"So Okay, so at this stage, I think that you've done a really good job of trying to fight off the depression. Okay. But I think that it's time to reconsider. medic How long have you been off the meds."
11958.0,Patient,"For depression, like a couple of months only few months. Like. A couple months not."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's gonna still you know impact your moods right. couple months it's actually you know that's that's a second. Okay, so that's a significant amount of time, so I think that. I do think it would be a really good idea to get another appointment with her to address depression, because it's starting to become we don't want it to become debilitating for you, because the more you stay in bed, the more really pisses your mama."
11958.0,Patient,yeah I know I know and like seeing with me it pisses me off.
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
11958.0,Patient,In my mind like i'm right now i'm putting on my tennis shoes getting ready to go jog around the neighborhood but I can't actually get myself to do that makes me crazy.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's that's. that's the passion. To get you out of this place Okay, we talked about like one of the next goals for you would be to find a job it's difficult to find a job when you're depressed. it's difficult to find a job when you are in bed. When you're depleted when you're exhausted and you're tapped out."
11958.0,Patient,"The other other thing I think contributing to this honestly is endometriosis. Because that is. I was on my period all last week and the week before that I was cramping and I felt like a little my period but nothing's actually coming out, it was just hell. And so, when you're in pain for such a long amount of time consistently, it is absolutely draining and like this, I feel like suboxone helps to a certain extent on it, but it's. Not it's definitely not like enough itches but not. Not The other thing I just like. I keep looking at it like no solution because i'm never ever gonna take pain medication for this again because that's never ending road, and this is, been a never ending story for me until like I decided to permanently have some kind of you know surgery. dot this all together. i'm going to have this problem and I can't take pain medication every time because it's too it's like two weeks, out of the month that's an addiction like, no matter how you cut it and. So. But I i'm just like i'm not trying to feel sorry for myself or making excuses either I know I needed to do things and get like that's The other thing that's annoying as well, my mom tells me. When you get a job you can't like colon sick every day because your stomach hurts you can't. To stay feel, I feel, to a certain extent, things that i'm over exaggerating my pain. This disease. i'm not."
226.0,Provider,Now it's painful it's very painful for people. what's the docker what has the doctor recommended anything else sides pain pills.
11958.0,Patient,"Like birth control pills. Which that's like I don't necessarily want to do that either, because when I would take them for one thing I like very rarely would be able to remember to take a pill every day I don't know why I can't do that came to my vitamins every day, I really needed. But. It I didn't feel like it would make a difference, like, I would still it would stop my periods, but then I will still have the pain, like my periods for months, at a time that I would still every month have that cramping. So, then, I felt like maybe its worst for my body that it's like staying in my system not coming out. And then the other option, obviously, is like surgery again to like go clean it out and the last time I spoke to my doctor I had. done an ultrasound to check for like any tumors or anything but for some reason I haven't been able to go over those lab results with him, like every time I call they take a message and every time he calls me my phone because it's a blocks number that he's. meal. So I don't know how to get that message across to them that, like i'm not getting these phone calls. I try calling right now actually because I think he's in surgery today so maybe they can get a message and like to call me later on tonight on my mom's phone or something."
226.0,Provider,I want to go was on did you do that.
11958.0,Patient,I did that literally. I think in August.
226.0,Provider,Okay. You need to know what those results are.
11958.0,Patient,"And then the pointed out, was to like check for anything and then. surgery so. I do, that hopefully and then that honestly did help relieve I still had pain that it was bearable, it was just like it to me what seemed like a normal period should feel like. Right it wasn't what I imagined giving birth feels like. Every two weeks, like it's unbelievable."
226.0,Provider,How long will it last for.
11958.0,Patient,It honestly it lasts like for the better portion of the two weeks. My pain. will go from like a 10 out of 10 to like a seven out of 10.
226.0,Provider,"Can you after our appointment, can you go back to the virtual clinic and set up an appointment with Sean town."
11958.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,Or do you want me to. ask them to reach out to you.
11958.0,Patient,"I can do it. I can do. All. I. can make some doctors appointments today, and then I will also put in some applications for work on indeed. because those are things that I can do lying in my bed."
226.0,Provider,It hot bath help to have salt like sea salt baths anything homeopathic.
11958.0,Patient,"likeness like the one I know it always helps like take a shower rinse off the last thing I wanted to like be touched by anything like water everything, just like i'm so sensitive."
226.0,Provider,yeah What was it like your receptors you know.
11958.0,Patient,"having to take my clothes off and then just the cold air touching my skin and between the time that I, you know, have to get in the shower like me and then turn off it just like i'm in the water hitting my skin I don't know why that freaks me out."
226.0,Provider,"Is that always or is that, just when you're having that pain."
11958.0,Patient,"it's really when i'm have it's just when i'm having the pain it's what. it's what i'm like really, really, really stressed depressed."
226.0,Provider,What about taking a bath do you like Apps can you do that.
11958.0,Patient,"yeah yeah same thing, like."
226.0,Provider,"A salt like sea salt baths like you know bass. yeah or even like sea salt, really, really, really detoxifying. China. I would also have you kind of researched and Dimitrios and. Like more on. You know just other remedies, like other things that would help besides pain medication."
11958.0,Patient,"hysterectomy. hysterectomy. birth control is what's supposed to regulate it. And I think they do have like certain new medications out but I don't want it, the whole point is to not take. Like the whole thing i'm fighting in my life, right now, and in my household right now is like that, because i'm taking medication i'm not sober. It drives me insane it drives."
226.0,Provider,me see if I can.
11958.0,Patient,"Not sober that's freaking ridiculous. There was a. mission that I don't know why I just thought of this, this is one that i've blocked out for a while I hadn't thought about this in a minute. But it was one of my it was like close to my birthday around my birthday time I was celebrating flows going hard, and this was like five six years ago. Maybe seven. And I. shot of heroin in the bathroom of a walmart and woke up to people like. hovering over me asked me if i'm okay oh my God, should they call the police, because I had apparently like passed out washing my hands at the think. yeah and I just got up, I was like no i'm fine i'm fine you know it's obviously no do not get the police involved that."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11958.0,Patient,But there's a big difference between that. Being. Here and.

226.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
11958.0,Patient,"what's gonna interrupt my life, somehow, so I i've never had a job, where it hasn't interfered. Well Mike. How do you explain that to an employer, you know, like. And so that's The other thing, but my mom takes it as like I need to get off my ass and I need to go to work and do whatever I needed to fight through it, but like she honestly doesn't understand it's not me being lazy it's. it's paralyzing like and then, even if I can somehow manage to stand up on my feet and stand in front of a customer at work, I can't I can't process, what is happening, like. I can't promise. That interaction because of what's going on inside of me, you know, like how talking carry on like nothing's going on, like literally I feel like i'm a believer."
226.0,Provider,You know i'm just curious like I it's worth asking if shauntel. knows I was meant to have you mentioned it to her.
11958.0,Patient,"yeah she does know she does know, and I think she told me like I definitely need to see an Ob for it. But i'll ask her again like if she knows and been have any remedies any medication, do you like that I do, I will call my Ob after this again, but like I said his His solution is pretty much surgery so."
226.0,Provider,"Is that an option for you, at some point."
11958.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i've done it before. It What was it like six weeks it wasn't the worst like eight weeks, but. What i'm scared about that whole situation is."

11958.0,Patient,I definitely did last time. And also writing to is like.

11958.0,Patient,Nothing else has been. attached to the peers up into there's already something on there. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So. Alright, so I think oh you're on mute. Your unmute."
11958.0,Patient,"Okay. Do not recognize that. But um so I don't know like if i'd have to stop the suboxone or taper off. And then start taking payments, I would have to tell my doctor that i'm taking suboxone because then he would have to give me the pain medication to knowledge drop so it's like a whole thing. As opposed to I don't do it, but I all still tell him that i'm on the soapbox and, obviously, because I don't want them to give me anything there. And then I just. Take ibuprofen and pray and feeling."
226.0,Provider,Like. You know if you taper off the suboxone.
11958.0,Patient,yeah sometimes I just posted can really work.
226.0,Provider,"Like it really does make a I can can notice a difference, depending on obviously the level of pain like. People do that."
11958.0,Patient,yeah.

11958.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah definitely. The first step, I think I got a call the. doctor and go over those results and."
