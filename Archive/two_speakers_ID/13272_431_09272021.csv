431.0,Provider,Oh um how's the medication working out for you any with your mood.
13272.0,Patient,"I think it's fine, except that I feel tired sometimes."
431.0,Provider,"Okay um so tiredness will be lots of issues, how are you sleeping."
13272.0,Patient,"By the way, my sleeping is good, I mean it's. I mean it's hard to get up in the morning but. I think it's okay."
431.0,Provider,"yeah are you getting like how yeah like on average five to six hours. Okay, well, I can tell you that. Not enough by. um you know, I think that contributes to tiredness not everybody needs a full eight hours of sleep, but maybe a little bit more might be helpful."
13272.0,Patient,"I know i've. been told that. My mood has been good my mood has been good, I did not feel don't feel too anxious anymore and. I don't know about the depression, because the depression comes and goes, I guess, I mean i'm not i'm not really sure anymore. But no generally i've been in pretty decent mood."
431.0,Provider,"yeah I mean medication is a tool to help. Right yeah like you said a lot of times things like depression can be triggered by whatever else is going on and not to say that you know you're not capable of coping with things, but the medication again is a tool, I always just double check, because sometimes I feel like."
13272.0,Patient,I know I feel like this is the best medication i've been on so far so.
431.0,Provider,"yeah and that might be why that's you know, keeping you going to tiredness again, it could be a sign of a man man managed depression, but That said, it can also be due to not sleep."
13272.0,Patient,You know yeah right though I have a lot of work but. i'll.
431.0,Provider,"i'll get back to that routine i'm not gonna belabor that point but i'm the same way, I think my hours for the last 10. I need to get more sleep, too, because I feel like when you're sleeping that's when it flushes out all that, as a lawyer Plath. I can contribute in memory loss. is my own personal like fear of dementia because of it, so it's a good reminder for me baby Bernard that I need to sleep or two. But, for your so your met your meds are right now, let me see she got called in she sent them two weeks worth of medication yeah but i'm seeing also now is our system, I can. How much quantity of medication to give to any of our clients or patients, based on a few things we look at. And the intent of those to make sure we're monitoring make sure it's working so yours currently it's on yellow so it's three colors right green red, yellow yellow or red, yellow green. Is what we're looking at. Those are triggered by things like a payment attendance. i'm so sorry."
13272.0,Patient,"Oh that's that's okay yeah like you were saying that it's triggered by appointment attendance, so I did complain, because I have not been receiving any of the appointment reminder at currently i'm working at a hospital and then get called in for different shifts and it's sometimes hard. I mean, I know that Fridays, I have. group appointments and usually like I can go in and tell them that hey I have a shift this, I cannot attend. But most of the time I don't get any appointments and i've complained about it, but they said that it's my responsibility, like one of the persons. From care navigation said that it's my responsibility that I need to remember and some of these appointments for like a month away and i'm i'm like most of the people here are probably coming in, for any of the mental health issues and related issues, and for me that definitely is forgetfulness. or yeah yeah. Especially like when does all these other things that are happening. And I need assistance with that and I feel like I haven't received it so. I complained about it. And I don't know what's happening, but. I rather wanted someone to any way that I shouldn't be complaining about you to you."
431.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think your points are valid right getting those appointment notifications is helpful for people like us, are busy and more our system was supposed to actually send you a reminder, the day before your appointment, based on my understanding, are you not getting those."
13272.0,Patient,"nope I get I get a notification after I missed the point. Man and then. me a text send an email and i'm like wait, I had an appointment today that I missed and now i'm going to get charged $50."
431.0,Provider,"So that. See you have appointments in the schedule that I can see, and when I can see it, it should notify you. ahead of time. We were moving process where people weren't getting scheduled ahead of time even their reoccurring appointments we've worked past that challenge and that's why people weren't getting it because it's technically not on their schedule that's. we've worked up past that I do see you have an upcoming appointment on Friday October October 1 yes um so you should be getting a reminder for that. Okay, what I can do right now, because I do have to operate under the our systems requirement. For prescriptions, is that I know this is your entire price and the super important. i'm going to send it in to just the Friday to get you to Friday appointment and then shauntel can get you on back on the same schedule, because right now we're off a little bit, and I know it's. I just want to make sure people's medications are lined up with their appointments, because it makes no sense is that sound Okay, for you, so you will have to probably do two trips to the pharmacy this week, but that's because our system is asking me to oh sorry, can you hear me."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not quite following the Irish are you say that at this week, I will not be having my medication until Friday."
431.0,Provider,"So now, I will send in. A bicycle or a to Friday right now so like. Okay, the production. and on Friday. When you see shauntel. I think that's a valid point she can put you back on your regular schedule. Okay okay you do need to see you on a regular basis, right now to just make sure, things are working. I know if you ever feel like you're stable, and if you if you and the provider agree you don't need to be seen that off the BAT as often as frequently that can be adjusted."
13272.0,Patient,or.
431.0,Provider,Not her of time i'm so.
13272.0,Patient,glad to talk to you about that.
431.0,Provider,"But you'll have to. So generally is between you and the provider who has to come to an agreement. On what makes the most sense for you. Okay sounds. Like something and I know other than your Meta him and your regular group met appointment, on Friday, you have a MED follow up appointment on the fourth I see schedule with shontelle yes so next. Okay, so that would be a perfect time and discuss mm hmm. Okay, because you'll have a little time will tell you can talk about how things are working for you. evaluate the frequency of our appointments and if it makes sense, still and you know the providers can definitely prescribed as much or as little as they see fit, that can keep the patient, you know manage but also safely monitored."
13272.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
431.0,Provider,"That makes sense yeah yeah so um the connection is crappy I don't want to keep you on the on here with me for for me to make a call to your pharmacy and confirm a couple pieces of information, your pharmacy right now I see it, sliding is the CDS."
13272.0,Patient,"Yes, yes okay."
431.0,Provider,"melrose melrose okay. I will give them a call to send them a five days supply prescription to last to last you until Friday and the day after, and in case there's any wiggle room needed. It is important for you to stay on your medication when was the last time you took your cymbalta. Okay, this was yesterday so perfect. And that is, I wanted to continue that you know any interruption to the medication management can cause some side effects with diesel. To actually going with the impact of persons, you know I noticed with your so that's not something you want to discontinue without letting the doctor now or you know. As far as your appointments, you should be getting notifications. know that you have an appointment this Friday, if you cannot attend these because of your work schedule my advice is really. That you need to cancel it when you cancel it it doesn't count against you. Like it won't you know you won't be in a week, you know that whole that light system, I was not licensed but the color system, I was describing to you that red, yellow green. If you cancel ahead of time that those typically won't count against you, but obviously if we if we don't see you for over a month and then that's like we went into another issue about monetary so um. But, so I did see you canceled, the most recent appointment, but prior to that you know showed a couple, and that is why you're in the yellow. I see so just."
13272.0,Patient,On the l yellow ever since I started.
431.0,Provider,Oh yeah okay let's try to get you to the green. Part of this because I think you need to attend an individual appointment with a therapist.
13272.0,Patient,yeah see those are the appointments that I never get a notification for. are usually month away and i'm like.
431.0,Provider,"yeah so, but you aren't getting notification when you miss them."
13272.0,Patient,yeah i'm getting notification when I missed somebody sends me an email.
431.0,Provider,So that so your phone number on file.
13272.0,Patient,Is 99 2619903 i've confirmed.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, you have so be Gomez grass in her Doc yeah."
13272.0,Patient,I never made any. sense to me.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, that doesn't make sense, and I will put a note in."
13272.0,Patient,Thank you.
431.0,Provider,"Ah, functional explanations for things that's completely, all in all, in our system supposed to cash it um but i'm not going to get on the phone what I will do is colonists switch into your CDs i'll text you."
13272.0,Patient,Thank you.
431.0,Provider,"Sorry, all in the ocean, and you, I can see my Internet being weird um. That sounds like a plan and then follow up on towel on Friday to get your normal prescription and then on Monday, please just write it down and whatever system you keep you keep track of things to discuss her to her about like a frequency. Okay, does that make sense to talk really fast between my Internet."
13272.0,Patient,made sense.
431.0,Provider,Is there anything I can help you with.
13272.0,Patient,No there'll be all.
