252.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah. Well, I."
3242.0,Patient,"can only afford to do that. And then she's got two people that she is the pay E4 and God they make her life, like a living hell. i'm like mom if you need to be these people's pay that's one thing that you should have never ever ever but they move in with you because they were homeless and you felt bad for him. Right, because now all of their problems are your problems and you're just the payee you're not getting paid to take care of them. She can ever have any behind you do anything for herself they. The one thing I like about the eight to four schedule is then I can go have coffee coffee with my mom in the morning but. When she doesn't get sleep, because one of them is going in and now up and down the stairs in now up and down the stairs then it's like she can't get anything done the next day because she's too tired and Mike why don't you just kick them out long. You can be there P, and now so security is they're gonna you're gonna they can't live with you something so that you have some peace of mind. Because when your husband comes home all this shit that they're doing there is gonna make him end up being too stressed out and have a heart attack."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm. Much she say.
3242.0,Patient,"She seems to think that she's gonna be able to handle it and i'm just like. It makes my blood boil because she can't spend any time with us my my daughter will not take the baby over there, because they most of the gentlemen scare her hold on just a second and she's got the smoke alarm going off. Where ever since they put that stupid smoke alarm in the frickin hall. We can't cook nothing without the damn thing going off i'm like open the doors come on she's like trying to fan in front of them like just open the doors. So I missed our last counseling because I got called into work and totally forgot to try and call you and let you know and reschedule."

Is concerning me i'm like that's not right Anthony like we need to get you to the doctor and. find out what the. Fuck is going on, like is it your medicine, or are you just like. Constantly or something like what the hell. So, and then the baby did end up getting referred to San Francisco for the little spotlight her I."
252.0,Provider,So you just got things going.
3242.0,Patient,"And then get this so then my grandson lot was it 24 hours, I think it was last month, he got circumcised and there's little reader would not stop. So, having to spend the night like she they send them home and then she gets home and like it just won't stop bleeding and she waits a couple hours still just like bleeding. So."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
3242.0,Patient,"that's not even at my cousin finally had her baby and. She um. She was do like not for another week but supposedly but they decided to go ahead and do the C section and the baby was only five pounds one ounce and 17 inches long. Oh that's not a year and a half minute just found out that. mom was released, but baby is not because baby is having with girls. and um she had like the last half of her pregnancy, she had gotten on the suboxone and my aunt was trying to say, while she was still pregnant that. Oh yeah, we have to make sure the baby's not gonna have withdrawals from the box and i'm like I know, several people that were in the program with me that had babies. Never once did their babies ever have to stay in the hospital because they were having withdrawals from suboxone I don't think it was that, what about the alcohol she drank for the first half of the pregnancy in a pain pill she took like come on."
252.0,Provider,wow.
3242.0,Patient,So. She may end up having a CPS case because of it.
252.0,Provider,"yeah she might. Definitely, depending on what they find in the baby system."
3242.0,Patient,But. The baby was born in medford which is two hours north of us in Oregon so I don't know if they would conduct our county or what.
252.0,Provider,Probably.
3242.0,Patient,yeah so.
252.0,Provider,"Well, they would I don't believe that they would let the baby lead from the hospital."
3242.0,Patient,"And, and the dad owns his own business and is a contractor and makes really good money so. yeah. wow they may they may let the baby go home with him. Like into his custody which. I don't know things may change because he never wanted her to have a baby in the first place."
252.0,Provider,Well we'll see.
3242.0,Patient,"But that would be a good way for him to get the baby and get her out of his life. mm hmm like in the beginning here well nothing to do with her he's all she did on purpose. So. I thought it was kind of weird like. All the times, I went over there, and she was crying because she was pregnant and he didn't want nothing to do with her and. Basically, all he was like she would ask him, something or tried to talk to him and his answer would be like one letter one word and. Then all of a sudden it went from that to oh he's so happy he's being so supportive and i'm like something's not right here people don't just look like that normally you know."
252.0,Provider,"yeah yeah more is going to be revealed. Right. I gotta get going, I got one more after you. Okay okay so keep doing what you're doing and. you're doing amazing."
