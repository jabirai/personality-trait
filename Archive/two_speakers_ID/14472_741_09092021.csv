14472.0,Patient,problem with his computer ever.
741.0,Provider,yeah.
14472.0,Patient,"I was, I was just confused as to what am I gonna do next as to when we would meet next, and all that I felt weird hanging this. creaminess blowing in the wind like that."
741.0,Provider,Well that's fine. And what i'm trying to do right now is put together a treatment plan so that we have some focus on what we're doing. um and. What i've got so far. i'm. A goal to learn to relax and think accurately and logically about. Events to. To this to this spell some of the anxiety that you having.
14472.0,Patient,Over to breathe.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, learning to breathe and things like that. Also to decrease dysfunctional thinking and increase positive self enhancing talk. Self talk so that it all wound up in I don't know what to do. In bogged down by all of that. And, and then I also want to. identify and and and replace some cognitive self talk. That support because you've got you've got self target supporting the Depression and anxiety and. stuff keeping you down and we need to build you up and we need to teach you to build yourself up. Okay, and then I would. assume that I was."
14472.0,Patient,Like we learned it's like re. Re yeah if we Program.
741.0,Provider,"Because you've gotten some programming that's that's negative that's running through your head and we want to, we want to change that back into the. positives and then also some strategies for coping with the pain. And I haven't gotten your treatment plan completely down yet um they come across this computer program thing that they do comes across was a real generalized type thing. um and I don't like it i'll be real honest so i'm going to sit down and put down some goals and some objectives and then. We can go over them and then, if you like them, then you can sign them and we can call that your treatment plan and start really focusing on taking steps to help improve your situation, even if it's not externally internally."
14472.0,Patient,Absolutely.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
14472.0,Patient,ways to mean you.
741.0,Provider,"have to find. Because i'm not i'm not a medical doctor I can't tell you what what is possible or not possible, as far as i'm healing and all of that stuff, but I can tell you that I can help you learn. techniques to manage the pain. And um. We can we can find like online free yoga classes that might be helpful. um we'll just have to find out what what's your interest and see where we can take that you know and how we can find resources that are going to match your personal resources. So that's kind of I just started working on that, while I was waiting for you to return because and it's probably easier for me to just kind of put it together and then go over it. um and the other thing is I don't remember. um when you have another appointment."
14472.0,Patient,Now I know yeah I didn't I didn't see one.
741.0,Provider,Okay um.
14472.0,Patient,But I don't think we had a really talked about exactly what. course I would have because you needed to be able to. You could figure out what plan of action to do.
741.0,Provider,"Right I get it, and I believe you are counseling your. suggested to receive counseling twice a month. Individual counseling. group counseling yeah and group counseling weekly. i'm."
14472.0,Patient,"weekly on that, but I mean it should almost be opposite I wish it were opposite, that is so weird now, we can do different currently or can we only do what they."
741.0,Provider,"Say i'm. Okay, I don't remember you're you're on medicaid Is that correct."
14472.0,Patient,No something like. smell medicaid.
741.0,Provider,yeah okay yeah and I don't know what. That financial obligation would be if. yeah.
14472.0,Patient,"I was told you can be 364 times a year. Okay, and I was told. in general."
741.0,Provider,problem seeing you every week. That.
14472.0,Patient,"that's fine but. As far as I know, that's what I was told because it goes back to straight medical I guess when you're doing counseling it's different than like when you go to see a regular doctor it's different anyway."
741.0,Provider,And they do for a.
14472.0,Patient,"Living what they do is they initially put in the. The initial okay for any counseling once it's approved then it's up to you what you do with it apparently and it's just a matter of you know. Okay, whatever I don't know, but I was told that you guys do have that whatever you want basically available whatever you think the client needs so say a person wears a supplies they need a daily site it's covered, I mean they took for. You I can play, but I will how about being thankful for what it does cover you know what I mean so let's just."
741.0,Provider,"dive so what I suggest that we. Go ahead and see each other weekly um. Especially To begin with, you may you may get tired of seeing my face every week I don't know but. um but let's start there now right now, you have an appointment for the 23rd. yeah at 10 o'clock."
14472.0,Patient,OK.
741.0,Provider,So.
14472.0,Patient,The proper total.
741.0,Provider,"yeah and but. We could do that we could do it next week at the same time as well. Okay, so I left things teeth."
14472.0,Patient,And that's or what is the week of it is. And then.
741.0,Provider,We can get yeah we can just schedule it for 10 o'clock on Thursdays and every week. i'm doing it that way.
14472.0,Patient,"know what the time varies on that or if itself, the same time, each week or if you missed it in there. I didn't know what it how the group meetings are scheduled or if you."
741.0,Provider,should attend the same. group at that same time every week.
14472.0,Patient,"Okay, and if you did miss it then what happens, like this one, that the same thing happened, I was. Having issues. Okay, I promise like next week, you and I will go fine, I have a good feeling about that only reason it. didn't they didn't after we funny I couldn't give us that computer well, I want you start again for that issue and way."
741.0,Provider,"Right right and. If you mix. They prefer that you doubt. and They prefer that you don't miss. it's Nice, and you can do."
14472.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, I really am. between you and me i'm not a person who wants to miss appointments in fact I was getting really upset this last main practitioner that I had that they were rescheduling more than they were making appointments."
741.0,Provider,Right now.
14472.0,Patient,That made me sick physically I was like i'm out of here this I can't deal with these people.
741.0,Provider,"Right right needs. Who is no no. So I get that. So um now that you've got technical issues squared away. Then you and I can meet on at 10 o'clock on Thursdays. And then, whatever day and time your group is you can meet. With them at that point."

741.0,Provider,Right there's some.
14472.0,Patient,"like this backward I didn't know, I was behind in paperwork I didn't I didn't know that that was. that's Okay, and then, so I feel bad that she may not want to do anything from because i've been donated or answered any question years I didn't know I thought, only the ones, because I was told I was done, where I was whoever I. know I thought you have."
741.0,Provider,Right. yeah no I.
14472.0,Patient,understand that.
741.0,Provider,I mean never comprehension yeah so.

741.0,Provider,"Be out yeah yeah well and I and, unfortunately, not all the people that work for this company are from the United States. So they don't totally I don't think English as their first language. Right and make it frustrating."
14472.0,Patient,"I don't they're very. But, but it is a stone in the past, so to speak. right but i'm used to dealing with that, unfortunately, because of what I do, for our part time work it's I deal with them all the time. partner. it's like it's pretty."
741.0,Provider,"It can get frustrating very. Because communication is not always an. easy thing, even when you both speak English as a first language and then you start adding. It as a second language, and then it becomes communication becomes even more difficult."
14472.0,Patient,"yeah it's just it's like adding fuel on the fire is the way I see it, it's so."
741.0,Provider,great to have.
14472.0,Patient,"We have so much in our country, why do we have to have that issue."

741.0,Provider,"weekly or see to those she should be in your group. Oh come and say. Give medication group, and so, when you go to group you'll have a counselor that does your group, but you'll also have and have a. chance debts and she'll be in the group and she'll be doing medication like refills and whatever else you. need to talk to her about. So okay. it's kind of a is that it's a multipurpose group."
14472.0,Patient,Face yeah questions that's the place to take them.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, okay. Now, and and and. Sam their medical provider of their medication push fiber and individually every so often so that's another possibility as well."
