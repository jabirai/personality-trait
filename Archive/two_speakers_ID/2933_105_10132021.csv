2933.0,Patient,"I i'm here we're we're doing okay um you know, ever since my daughter left it's been peaceful. Peaceful um yeah we you know me and the boys get along great you know my other daughter is doing good or don't see her either, but busy working um it's just stuff you know um. I guess, I can say i'm going to be honest, this week, I was kind of angry very angry um. I had a situation where my other daughter Clara she helps her dad out and some stuff so. i'm. He has he has a new girlfriend he moved in so you know Claire has been trying to adjust to that so um At first I you know I thought it was going okay and Claire was getting along with her. And till i'm. They they i'm the dad. The dad has a side business where on weekends, he sells out a glorious market so Clara occasionally have she has a day off he'll ask if she wants to go. So the girlfriend the new growth, the moving girlfriend let's put it this way she tagged along okay. Okay um and I didn't know if I told you that he was only like two houses down the street from me. So um I don't meet up with them much you know and there's a there's a big on occasions where you know my talk to him, you know he's never said anything never he's never been rude to me while. Clara had. called me crying she said that they were there just helping themselves and. The girlfriend. decides to all of a sudden blurted out in front of everybody. She says. Well, in clara's words, this is what she said. Clara doesn't even look like you, she looks just like your mom like her mom says, having to ever looked at her she's not even yours, she says, you need. to wake up and smell the coffee. I gosh out of nowhere."
105.0,Provider,wow.
2933.0,Patient,"So clarion did a plane and called me and I was angry, I was gonna go over there and beat her up when I was so mad, he should have seen me I was like you know what started me I guess. I started putting on my shoes, because I was so mad, and I was home that. One my my younger son one tells me mom he says he tells me you're not you know you're neither a teenage girl, you know arguing in high school, he says. You know act like an adult he says, you know you he says i'm fix it in a different way you're going to end up until I was so mad Oh, but I was mad. Well, so Clara calls with crane and then she says it's okay i'm on my way home and, as I was, like okay. Well, I ended up calling him and I didn't think he was going to answer because I figured at that point he knew I was going to be mad and call him, so I thought he's not gonna answer the phone while he answered. And I told him and he told me well, I didn't know he says um I didn't think Claire took it that bad when she said she was leaving I thought she had to go. And then I told him um it's not funny you know I told him, he says, I know he says i'm sorry he says we'll just tell her that i'll talk to her and don't worry i'll handle things here that's all he said. But when I was so mad. I was like i'm you know me this is a new girlfriend and he's had you know various girlfriends you know. You know Clara got along with her Okay, and this came out of nowhere, you know it was like. No, no, you know, but I was angry."
105.0,Provider,"Now to the point that you might have you might have driven over there, and you might have gotten in a fight."
2933.0,Patient,"yeah I might have punched her out, I was, I was a you know because. Your words, I mean you know. I you know I asked him, I asked him I told him is that what you think is that coming from you that's what I told him he knows that, coming from you, he says no, he said, why would I ever doubt Claire be mine she looks exactly like me. He says it says he looks exactly like me says everybody, does he looks exactly like me, so I would ever even doubt or being Mike and I said, my wife, why would you allow that you know why, would you allow her to treat her like that. And then he says he tells me, you know me he says everything just goes over my head, he says, I didn't even notice that they weren't getting along, he says, I didn't notice they weren't getting along. He says, and when she said that he says he says, you know me he says, I just joke about everything you know I didn't take it so serious, I told, but I did you know I told him I did I was upset."
105.0,Provider,So this is. let's just say that this is clara's. hurt or. So let's just say it wasn't yours to fight for for Clara and it wasn't you know he's not going to change So where is this an opportunity for for Clara to do some work herself. With. What to do with a rude woman girlfriend is inappropriate and rude she has a right to think that she was birthed from an alien and you she can think whatever she wants to but her saying it out loud right that's when it becomes socially inappropriate and insensitive um. But that's clear as hurt So where does that come in.
2933.0,Patient,"um. It but you know, first of all, it bothered me because i'm. You know, growing up cleric didn't have a father, because you know what I got from him when i'm I didn't see him I didn't see what I got from him on a fling okay. And I didn't see him for 12 years and that's see that's when I met that's when I met once Father my my youngest one and I married him and the thing was when we got married. He raised Clara since she was six months old. And that's where all that hurt comes in, because when we ended up getting divorced, he left everything behind even long. and never came back in someone never came back and stuff Clara never and it's like he totally gave up on them, so you know all of a sudden, I meet up with clara's Father again and we end up together after all those years right. And even though we didn't make it, you know i'm he's always you know. He know he's always told me, you know Clara you know, he says Clara looks like miss Jones did he saw her one time when she was like newborn and that was it, I never saw him again. So that's where the hurt comes because to her, you know. It bothers me it bothered me because she had a father, you know once once dad do you know Kwan senior was always her dad and then she lost that one, so you know it, it really bothered me you bothered me it's like. But you know afterwards we talked about it in clarion laughs and you know what she told me she says that woman's just jealous mom you know I realized it she's jealous jealous of view. She says she told me, you know I don't know the woman they don't know the new girlfriend they don't know her, but apparently she knows me I don't know from where. She don't clear I seen your mom you look, just like her. But I took learn she's just Dallas and we laughed about it afterwards, so it made us feel better we laughed about it, but at the moment I was angry angry, to the point where I could have beat her up, I was so mad."
105.0,Provider,How often does that kind of intensity show up for you.
2933.0,Patient,"it's been a long time it's been it's been a while, since i've felt that angry, you know to, to the point where I was like not me, you know I felt like I was like. Not me, I felt like I was seeing black life, you know what I mean like I got so mad. yeah it was. And that has not happened in a long time, and I think if I would have been here at home alone, I would have walked out the door and probably. been I would have probably I probably be sitting in jail, right now, but you know my son told me, you know, making this one told me, you know mom. To an adult you're not a teenager sit there and think about it, he said he could have done, you know and it's true."
105.0,Provider,Do you remember when this blackout rage took over before Do you remember when that was startling.
2933.0,Patient,No. But I can remember the last time it happened.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, tell me."
2933.0,Patient,And I did hurt somebody that time.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, I was that."
2933.0,Patient,"It was a. And you're gonna lie it's funny but I mean now that I think about it it's not funny but um. When me and clara's dad separated I had this woman that actually does down the street from me and he had been doing some work for her and. This woman, I knew, she was and actually I had met her mom that lived in the same House but the mom passed away in an accident so she came to live there. Well, I had never had words with this woman right one day she calls me and tells me that she's a bit she had been sleeping with him for a while, you know. And I told her oh good I told what you can come and pick up his clothes to you know but me and him were already separated, so it didn't matter right well the next day, the woman comes over and knocks on my door right just to pick on me and she was this tall, you know tall white lady. And I had really never seen her like face to face, you know so she knocks on my door, you know and i'm like thinking what is she was right, I did answer the door and she had a six pack of beer in her hands right and she tells me. I just thought i'd come and talk to she was nice at first right, and then I told her what do you want her name was Rica, I name is rick Daniel is she still lives there. And I told her what do you want, and then she says, I just started come and drink the beer with listen, first of all, I told her, I do not drink, I told her right. I try to be nice when I try to be nice and she told me oh come on don't be sorry loser right and i'm like I looked at her and I tell her you know every to get on your car get off my property leave me alone, and she says. She says no i'm not going anywhere have a beer with me, she says. And I said no right and I kept telling her get on your part, well Clara then was the light younger, because this was like. Six years ago so Clara might have been. Clear comes out and at that point, you know Clara knew the story so she tells her you know, a reader get off her property before I get you put you on your car right so she says. She says she says wanted to just shut up she says you little piece of trash, just as you just like your father well that was it. My world just went black and I hit her, not only did I hit her, she fell back on to the does my house is like on the end of the curve I hit her and she felt back that she was wearing a dress right so she felt bad and. I hit her I kicked her in the gutter by the here and I directed to her card and I told her, I told her you better get on your client leave before I heard you. She ended up getting up off the floor, and she got on her car and went home, of course, you call the police. And the police came over here, and he tells me, you know well, you hit her, and I said yes, I did I said tell you some back and i'll get her again. I said, first of all I said I never been to her house, other than when her mom lived there I said it's just picking on me, I said no, he disappeared on me and so he started calling me Darren and. I said i'm not going to put up with it, and he laughed and he tells me okay just stay away from me, so he left right but that day. It was dark I mean it was like I lost it."
105.0,Provider,"yeah you also mentioned one time it started. Well, I don't know what it felt like for you, but I remember you telling me when kareena was with her daughter and putting daughter sort of in the middle, it was before you had to put together the restraining order you were saying to me i'm afraid of what I might get."
2933.0,Patient,"That I might hit her and yeah and you know that time was kareena yeah I was angry, I was angry because. You know she put her daughter, in the middle of us, and then she had a dog and then she had just been you know tell me stuff and yeah but you know that day that's why, when kareena walked away started walking away I locked the door, because I figured if kareena walks back that's it. I probably you know. I do, I get very angry and you know that that anger that I felt over the weekend. has been. You know, like. I don't tell you a scary anger, because this was more than anger, I mean this was like."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
2933.0,Patient,"It was like an all day anger and um I couldn't sleep better and I was so mad even that night I was mad I was still angry, no matter what, even though I had had a conversation first time."
105.0,Provider,"Christina. This. Almost fugue state, which some people describe it sometimes it's almost they are unconscious and they almost are. That part of them takes over and it's it can't think rationally it can't have any other voices, you know if we're thinking about rationality is being able to hear other thoughts can't think. If we could spend a little bit of time with that you know how I know months back, it was important to you to do some deeper work that you kind of have an inkling there's some stuff inside. That needs to be addressed this this might be how it's showing up and we might be able to find our way to maybe some early ones that are associated with this rage. Would that be okay. Okay. So, as I, as I begin to invite you to to explore that this is a protective part of you right this range is protecting you. And, as I say, that are you noticing your physiology changing even in telling the story. Are you noticing any kind of constriction or tension anywhere in the body."
2933.0,Patient,um. This one I was telling you this story cuz I remember you know I just start spilling like. Like. Like like I have butterflies in my stomach like I don't know.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so butterflies. Can we go with that and try to bridge it back to. An earlier recollection of those butterflies. Sometimes they can be confused with excitement, but those wouldn't be the ones they oftentimes. butterflies can mean to almost opposite things. Even if you can find the ones where. rage showed up to try to help butterflies were there and then rage. cut back a little earlier see if we can find it much, much earlier. Or maybe rage hadn't started, maybe it wasn't permitted and all you had was just the butterflies."
2933.0,Patient,"I can't I can't really remember any you know when in incident to tell you the truth. You know, the only thing we were talking about you know me and the kids we did talk about that me and Clara In fact we were talking about that and. You know, I was telling her how of what I did I was telling her how one stop me from you know going, and she says, I know mom she says, you get really angry and I don't blame me and she says she says it probably and you know she didn't make a comment she told me, you probably feel like. You know those times gamma was really mean to you I bet you felt like hitting her, she says, but you never did she says, maybe that's where all your anger comes from you know."
105.0,Provider,So that.
2933.0,Patient,"And I do think that that's what it is, I think that um. So cuz I remember all that when I started to get angry, I remember you know mom the things she did, and they stopped to think you know. You know what, if I had actually you know I you know I always took it, I never I never raised my hand on my mom never. know. So I think a lot of the anger comes from that and then I went from that to being with. With the good father, you know the you know my first my first has been you know, he was a really you know he's to abuse me really bad and I think all that anger just stayed there you know I never defended myself, but I never did, and I think that now i'm like. I look back then, they say, well, I never defended myself, and now it feels like all that anger is just there."
105.0,Provider,"And that is certainly one way to look at it and that's that's a similar it's a similar sort of approach. except where is the remedy in in this information right it's still it's still sits there. It is. yeah so it's my opinion that some healing. might be useful, so that the. You know, when a trigger happens and the trigger is woman says nasty mean thing about my daughter what gets activated is all those years of being a victim. and not being able to mobilize fight or flight you had to stay put. And so it keeps happening over and over and over and over and it's it's got this heat and energy to it. But i'm just wondering if if we take a look a little bit more, if you can maybe close your eyes, with me and and I realized that it's not just one incident, this is complex post traumatic stress disorder, this is, day after day. and Abuse so it's it's. compounded it's not just one memory all the stories, but if you can just picture this younger self. Maybe in a memory, one that pops up where you can recall. Where you were. told something mean and insulted That was a part of the way your mother would treat you I certainly remember. When you were in adults, there was behavior but go back early let's see if we can address the child this inner child inside of you. This part of you. That may have other emotions going on, besides."
2933.0,Patient,anger.
105.0,Provider,"Today, will be looking at anger as a problem solver is the one that came about, to protect you. see if you can picture a younger version of you, and just let me know how old you look."
2933.0,Patient,So you want me to recall this one instance where I felt like I had to defend myself.
105.0,Provider,"Well i'd like you to remember, maybe the one of those early recollections of feeling. ashamed. or sad."
2933.0,Patient,"No as far back as I do remember, I think I was like maybe. I was really, really young I remember when. I guess the youngest memory, I could think of when I was really, really. scared was the time among um. I remember hitting me so bad, I was. bleeding my lips, and my nose. And I, I know I was like eyes, I know my little sister was small she must have been like. To two or three so that were made me like six or seven. Okay, and I remember my my I took my little sister we didn't have a front gate then we're growing up, we didn't have a front gate. It wasn't a busy road, so I had taken her outside and we were looking at this, I think we're looking at a school bus passing that she was excited that she wanted to see the school bus. I remember taking her out to the road, but it wasn't a busy road, because it was like we live like a dead end road, so it wasn't a busy with like those traffic really big and they remember taking around. My mom came out yelling at me and she ended up eating me so bad she busted my nose or my. my lips. amber running in, and I was I don't know if I I know. What I was feeling, then I remember being angry, I remember being angry and he hid under the bed. And then I wasn't crying I don't remember myself crying I remember, was angry and I got under the bed, and I stood there for the longest time and I remember the one that took me out from under the bed with my dad. When he came on."
105.0,Provider,"To take take a minute and let's just be with that part. and see if, for a moment, we can unblock end angry. From that memory. just see her there under the bed. How do you feel towards her when you see her there."
2933.0,Patient,"and I mean, I feel angry, I feel angry seeing her like that, because to have a way to defend yourself I. mean. You know, knowing you know I mean I know she has other sisters and it's so weird because i'm. When I you know it's weird because all the memories, I have. I don't see anybody else around with me."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so stay with that and for a moment again we're going to attempt to blend angry so let's get permission first I probably move too fast so i'd like you to picture. The angry part of you and it's a protector it's there to serve you. Whether it cares about the fallout, and the damage, whether you're arrested or you know it doesn't really probably care about that, but it certainly. Is there to protect you so just take a look at the angry part and if you if you can make sure it's isolated and it's just that part it doesn't do anything else, except maybe somehow maybe fight for you. Like. it's mobilized it's got this energy to it right and see if you can see it. and ask it, are you willing to move back a little bit so that gwen and I can heal this. wounded part. under the bed. And it's Okay, with the responses, but just make sure you tell me what the responses that there's no prescription, I just want to know what the responses. Say back to you notice."
2933.0,Patient,want me you want me to ask her if. yeah how how I can help her or you want me to ask for permission to help her.
105.0,Provider,"So I gotta check on something i'm going to just start so we moved i'm having you kind of look away a little bit from the child now i'm having you look at just the anger part they are separate parts one is the protector, and one the little girl is a wounded. part they are separate and I want you to see them as separate we'll start with this describe the angry part like when you envision it in your imagination. Well, hit mute sorry someone texted year or something. Christina. hit hit the mute button. Christina. Christina. Christina."
2933.0,Patient,"model go and come back. that's how angry, she was she wanted mom to disappear. that's why, when I look back at it, I I feel like there's other things they probably don't remember being younger, because at that point she's already angry she's only 67. So to you know she wishes mom would disappear if he wishes mom. wasn't even there you know that's how angry, she was you know i'm. she's not crying they don't they you know they don't remember that the client part to do some. And I tell you, she wishes, she could run away and come back."
105.0,Provider,couple of things happen first thing audio got lost.
2933.0,Patient,Oh.
105.0,Provider,"I know I know stay there it's okay it's okay now okay now I don't understand it, it came back on its own, but i've been saying Christina Christina."
2933.0,Patient,"I listened, probably the wizard because it's real windy here."
105.0,Provider,"So every once in a while open your eyes and make sure that I can hear you because I Okay, but stay there for a second right at the end, I noticed something. Again I don't have all the information you just shared but if, when I just heard was that you're angry part seems to still be very much blended. With this younger self are you saying, right now, if you were to look at the anger, you tell me how old is anger what's the age that anger appears to be. Like what's the age of that part."
2933.0,Patient,Like six or seven.
105.0,Provider,I see so it's it's really young.
2933.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was telling you, along with a lot of guys that you know it's funny because. i'm already anger angry at that age. I think there's other things I just don't remember."
105.0,Provider,All right.
2933.0,Patient,"And I was mom would just disappear and not come back you know, to me, you know at that age, I already I have thoughts of running away and not coming back. No."
105.0,Provider,"let's do this so much to look at the angry part and ask this should see young I didn't realize that, so this is actually still quite young part and and just make sure you you left this angry part know mom's not here. And that that part is safe, that you are not in danger. And and ask it if it's interested in you healing. The little girl inside. so that it does not have to work so hard being. A hearing us do I do because I want to know how it's actually what's going on in in there, so I do want to hear it, and I can repeat it, because it's a complex question."
2933.0,Patient,I know you're angry. I know I can't help you.
105.0,Provider,"Okay there okay all right, so what part right now. What is this tell me about this one, the one that's crying. With this. sister little girl says, the one that got scared."
2933.0,Patient,"No, because they look back at it with a good over."
105.0,Provider,"I know okay so there's compassion, I see okay so anger may have stepped back that's what we want to hear today, so I want you to stay with compassion for this little one under the bed just see her there. We don't need anger, right now, because it's we're Okay, because that was an a past experience, it is not who you are Christina, this is just a part it's an old old part and she's scared okay. When you look at her. What do you want to do to help as you're there with her feeling with her it's not your fault that she's scared, but what is it that you feel compelled and long to do to help her."
2933.0,Patient,I don't know I don't know cuz I. know I.
105.0,Provider,"Will right now it's not a memory, what I want you to do is look at her under the bed what's, the first thing that comes to mind when you think I have compassion for this little one there, she is, what do you want to do."
2933.0,Patient,A hugger okay.
105.0,Provider,"That and that's what we can do so, imagine somehow you guys are hugging. and feel her in your arms. She she knows you're there, and you knew just what to do. And how does that embrace feel."
2933.0,Patient,It feels. It feels good it feels warm feels like she needed.
105.0,Provider,yeah exactly. just see how long that lasts who maybe breaks away first. Know maybe that hug last a while. See if there's any rocking or any sounds that come up. Just really tune into what she needs.
2933.0,Patient,"No. No she just needs a hug yes, she feels really alone."
105.0,Provider,"she feels alone. Maybe share with her mirror that or validate that something like boy I sure imagine you feel alone under that bed like nobody's around and it's scary maybe something, whatever the truth is, however, you kind of see what she's going through just let her know you understand."
2933.0,Patient,"I understand you know I do it, you know I understand you know it will you still."
105.0,Provider,"But notice, you are there for her can you feel that that you have tenderness and compassion for the intensity of that loneliness. You can you can be there and hold her. keep coming back to that maybe stay in that called a little longer than you're expecting. Did you feel any love towards her."
2933.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,yeah me too. So.
2933.0,Patient,Small.
105.0,Provider,"And there's no one, but she has you. Just be aware, keep moving back and forth. Of this awareness that she has you. And you are safe. You will not hurt her. And let's now move into getting her out. of that area over into somewhere beautiful and safe, you probably have developed one of those safe places in nature up in the mountains, maybe your favorite spot. let's get her there. and have her see that that needing to hide. Is over that she can slam the door on that forever she never has to be in that moment ever again. picture her either closing the door on that image of going under the bed, but she never has to do it again. What do you see."
2933.0,Patient,I see you're happy. you're happy i'm sitting by the sitting by the water.
105.0,Provider,"Good. what's it like to be around for now, when she's sitting by the water happy."
2933.0,Patient,feels good it feels it just feels peaceful.
105.0,Provider,"And you knew just what she needed. comforting. Physical reassurance. and removing her from danger. let's go take a look over at at the angry part. check in with that part and ask it something like how have you been doing, while i've been taking care of this scared little girl, maybe asked that part how it's been because maybe it hasn't been watching what has it been thinking about during this time."
2933.0,Patient,You know. The angry part as.
105.0,Provider,"Well, was it watching we'll start with that wasn't watching."
2933.0,Patient,It watching it to our team and. it's like the angry part just comes and goes.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so we're going to get to know it a little bit more, because this is a very important part Okay, it has kept this system safe in some way, so I think understanding. Maybe look at this angry part and let's do this one out loud someone to watch closely what's going on in this this conversation maybe ask it. How old do you see me so maybe ask that out loud of that angry part say how old do I look to you, you look like you're you're about six how old how old do I look to you and wait for the answer."
2933.0,Patient,How do I look to you.
105.0,Provider,Are you gonna watch the image. describe what you see happen.
2933.0,Patient,I don't I don't see myself. Little I see myself older.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's keep make sure it stays stays a separate part so let's make sure you say it something like when someone make sure they're separate. Anger said you look like you're. What age. In my 30s 30s okay. And i'd like you to share with the angry part, how you experience being with a part of you that's sort of stuck at age six. So share with it in this go Nice and slow, we want to be gentle. But is it like for you. To see this anger is about the age of six. And it's what's protecting you. A six year old is protecting a 30 year old. what's that like."
2933.0,Patient,This scary.
105.0,Provider,"Tell that part try, this is a little bit more intense you scare me or I feel scared so talk directly to that angry part directly to it, I know, it seems weird but give it a shot."
2933.0,Patient,"No, you scared me."
105.0,Provider,"you're scaring me okay and watch the reaction on that part, how does it respond when you say you scare me."
2933.0,Patient,This. Just looks at me like. This is it so. A surprise look.
105.0,Provider,"yeah look surprised Okay, can you think that that little that very young angry part can you thank her directly for what she did."
2933.0,Patient,Thank you for. me. I don't know all all all that anger to come out a long time ago and it could have probably really hurt somebody.
105.0,Provider,So the fact that you stayed a six year old anger. Maybe meant that I didn't physically. heal anyone. yeah something like that.
2933.0,Patient,would think so.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, a little girl anchor versus a big strong woman's rate. Something like that. yeah yeah okay really watch her face make sure she hears your gratitude."
2933.0,Patient,I am.
105.0,Provider,yeah.
2933.0,Patient,i'm very happy.
105.0,Provider,She able to look you in the eye.
2933.0,Patient,Then she looks at me.
105.0,Provider,"Can you see maybe ask her if there's something else she'd like to do. Maybe ask, are you tired of doing this job, do you want to do something else."
2933.0,Patient,kind of protects me to protect you from going too far in a way.
105.0,Provider,"and asked her now would it be okay, if you didn't work so hard just ask her something like that."
2933.0,Patient,"Is it Okay, is this. know you don't need to try so hard does. It."
105.0,Provider,"Make sure it's a question, we want to get consent, would it be okay, if I healed my wounded parts, so you don't have to work so hard something like that."
2933.0,Patient,"Is it okay. Is it Okay, if I just just let you go."
105.0,Provider,"Okay we're not going to let her go no no close but that one's. To we don't want we're not going to let go of parts they're always going to be. In in your in your family of self and the internal family systems so let's shift it a little we don't have to say goodbye to her Okay, so all we're going to do is i'm exploring is your therapist changing what she does this is a six year old perch. six year olds are not supposed to be protecting adults are they. know, but you get to be grateful, but is there a sense that may be. Maybe she could do something else for the system, she could do something else or she could be helpful, but maybe not protecting you what else could she do you don't say goodbye to her just give her some other job duty. Could she do. or asked her what would you like to do instead of being. angry."
2933.0,Patient,"I just don't want you to be, I agree, I don't want you. Just to be happy, I do. make you laugh, maybe you didn't want to be angry."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're gonna go with make a joke. Okay, so let's let's do that want you to look at that part. Like you to say hey would you prefer to kind of crack a joke, instead of being angry."
2933.0,Patient,yeah can you just make me laugh make you know make some jokes instead of making me angry. angry.
105.0,Provider,comes back.
2933.0,Patient,smile.
105.0,Provider,Just okay. So um let's let's come back to to you and I talking and process a little bit.
2933.0,Patient,But before. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"So here's here's what I observed, I think that you still have some blended parts which means, although you know we did this where we're saying this is anger it's still blended with little girl. I think if we keep doing this. I think they will unplanned and you'll be able to isolate and be able to just see see the anger, but right now they're still very blended because I watched I watched whoops. There we go. Share repeat that you think. So it just looks like your anger and little girl part are still very blended that's My suspicion when that gets unblinded you're going to be able to just work on healing. That scared. hurt little girl. I think a little bit more work is going to be needed, because I was watching. watching sad face when. you're trying to say goodbye to. Just something and we're not going to say goodbye to anybody to none of these parts they're all there to take care of you. Okay, we can change the meaning, we can kind of shift the memory of that we can do, every time you remember something you alter it ever so slightly, so you are making changes in your relationship to these memories. And you. did some really good work today by doing what you just did, but I do think there's just this one on done piece. That if they're still blended together. So let's let's meet again let's figure out what timing works for you. Already, but I want to repeat you're not going to say goodbye. you're not going to say goodbye to parts that protect you and anger is an important one it's just that we want it to be. I think an adult you want it to be age appropriate we want it to to have the nuances that you have you know how your son was saying, you need to think right. But for you what's happening is it turns out, we discovered today you're angry part. Is a bit young, and so it won't surprise us then that it's going to be just scratch right because that's what kids do they don't know how to express. They just show they physically fight right, but as an adult anger it knows how to be assertive it knows how to set boundaries, and so we can give it different things, and I think we might be it might evolve into being an adult anger versus a child that's what I predict will happen. let's see right now the only thing I have are really early times, if you want want them next week, but we can push it forward another I have 7am next week, where we can move forward and I have an ATM. On October 27 27th okay let's do that."
2933.0,Patient,27 that am.
105.0,Provider,got it yeah. yeah and we'll see you on Friday.
2933.0,Patient,"Yes, will."
105.0,Provider,be good.
2933.0,Patient,Okay okay.
