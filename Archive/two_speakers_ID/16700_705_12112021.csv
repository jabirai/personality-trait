705.0,Provider,"That will be great right now in that group because i'm the facilitator in it and we had we started off with two, and now we have three and now you come in and will be for. Yes or yeah we're building building that group and it's a good group."
16700.0,Patient,look forward to it yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah okay.
16700.0,Patient,"yeah i'll get mentioned to me that the most most of the folks in the current group or just struggling with the overall. substance abuse, so I think I fit in right."
705.0,Provider,"And that is you know with it to me to Kenneth this is psych you know, some of them may be opioids so maybe. substance anything that changes your mood and that is being problematic is mine yeah."
16700.0,Patient,"sounds good. Okay, so I was hoping, since this is the first time i'm meeting with you i'm hoping to that we could just. Is level set and just feel like where we are currently and then we would like to go in, and I think that'd be a great conversation."
705.0,Provider,"Sure sure can, and so what happens today is, first of all, my name is Valerie Patterson and i'm a licensed alcohol and drug counselor and so i've been doing this for a bit I love it. And so what we do today is called like a bio sites social and so what you and I do today is is going to be different when you and I work in an individual session. will explore more we'll talk about coping skills. What we're going to do today is more of me asking some information or yeah it we're going to get all it's like your childhood history, and I appreciate to. You already gave me some really good on your history questionnaire. you've already filled that out so. I appreciate that so i'm going to use that to as a guideline."
16700.0,Patient,Perfect perfect.
705.0,Provider,"yeah, so we will do that today, and then getting more information about where you are today and then this way, we know what your treatment plan you know you and I will talk about that more in our individual session. And we get to know you better. Where it's like things that you're doing really well, and those are more of your strength based based we want you to grow on those we want you to keep."
16700.0,Patient,Those absolutely.
705.0,Provider,Thanks that you feel that are more problematic and they're giving you some challenges of being able to took take a look at that and how we can support you.
16700.0,Patient,"Yes, that that'd be great Thank you so much, I do really appreciate this this time and. opportunity that I have so. Thank you so much."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely Kenneth and then you and I, working together what we'll do too is we have what's called a care intensity, so they care intensity usually, when you come into the group it's usually come into the group every week. And so you'll be meeting with those on Wednesday nights at six o'clock. Yes, so that will be on a weekly basis yeah and then usually on an individual basis, I see people twice a month."
16700.0,Patient,Alright sounds good yeah.
705.0,Provider,"In the event, though Kenneth you feel like you need more support, sometimes I see people every week and then it would be for 30 minutes versus when I see people twice a month and it's usually an hour."
16700.0,Patient,"Right right right. Yes, absolutely."
705.0,Provider,"You can let me know you know, like let's say if we start meeting twice a month and we meet for that hour, if you feel like you need more support, then we'll we'll go ahead and schedule more appointments."
16700.0,Patient,"Right yeah I didn't show you that she got from Dr elegant and I just wanted to say i'm very supportive of the overall effort, but I do really appreciate your time here, so thank you so much. Absolutely yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And you know from after today we'll set our first appointment and then from there, you probably already you know have set up your other appointments. In here, I think, clinical communication and other things like that, where you, I believe, to usually you were able to have like a brief overview of different surveys and. Where you also can have, because I know a lot of things kind of come at you, when you."
16700.0,Patient,still hear us yeah Of course I appreciate this.
705.0,Provider,"yeah the surveys, are a helpful tool for us, and so, how I use it and we can use it when we're working together, and in this session is on anxiety, if you fill out the ged seven on the inside it. You and I work together you're doing a self report. It would give us a good guideline to to look at each each month. Yes, say, if your anxieties way up here in the next month, your anxieties down and then the Month after that it goes back up, we can start to see as their patterns what's going on here. i'm paying for you know if there's craving substance use anything like that so that's one of the reasons why we utilize the different surveys as a tool, sometimes people are like Why do I have to keep doing these surveys and. Right yeah so."
16700.0,Patient,Then.
705.0,Provider,i'll go ahead.
16700.0,Patient,"Oh yeah so so my understanding is i'm up for the group sessions, I have a. resource that I need to fill out every week, just to get make sure that everyone's aligned with with how i'm feeling that week, and so I am super on board with filling out the surveys and I think I will be on top of them filling those out. For the subsequent meetings I think one of the things I wanted to touch upon with some I understand I have individual meetings with Dr elegant as well as individual meetings with you. Your meetings seems to be the bi weekly where I will meet with you every other week, unless I have, I guess, additional. areas where I think I need I need a little bit of help, and so I think just taking a step back just overall from From my own perspective. I do feel like I would love to take advantage of the therapy session that I haven't you where i'm. I do feel like with my current struggles with them alcohol, as well as with marijuana i'm actually okay with keeping them like i've been sober ever since the date that I had planned to become sober and so I think my next steps are really focusing on the. The areas that made me be like get into marijuana and get into a call in the first place, so I think these are like lower like. The root causes of all the issues and I feel like a therapy would really help me out in that area, so i'm hoping to be able to leverage you and our conversations, to be able to focus on that aspect in the coming."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, I am happy to hear candidate that you sound dedicated and that you want this and. Yes, for you, for already setting your sobriety date and then doing it so you're making this happen, and yes, we will be going over you know. What we're going to do today and i'm going to ask some questions gathers information, then in our next session we're going to be able to you know discuss like what are some areas that you feel like you know if it's coping skills if that's. My life yeah and then go from there, and so. Yes, I like how open and willing, you are where you're like let's get this done so. I was big energy. Really."
16700.0,Patient,yeah I haven't had before what's called a bio psychosocial.
705.0,Provider,Where they asked the questions and they gather it.
16700.0,Patient,"I don't think I had before, I have, I have gone into them therapy in the past, where the therapist would just ask me a general like. sense of my overall history and to get a sense of like where where I am right now but I don't think i've gone through exactly what what you're describing so i'm happy to go through the process with you."
705.0,Provider,"Okay well good and the other thing i'd like to do before we get started Kennedy and you shared you have had their people for is the highlight with confidentiality and privacy. I Those are some really big factors for us, and so, if someone calls us tomorrow outside of Reinhard health and says. hey you met with Kenneth how that bps go I can't confirm or deny that. I view it."
16700.0,Patient,Exactly sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"You would have to sign the consent forms and you're probably fully aware that. exceptions to the confidentiality are, if you say you're going to harm yourself and i'm going to get you the help that you deserve and need and i'm gonna support you through that."
16700.0,Patient,If you say you're going to hurt somebody else i'm going to get them help i'm going to get you help.
705.0,Provider,"If you share that there's an emergency i'm going to get you help. outside of that we are mandated reporters for child abuse or if there's elder abuse, other than that it's confidentiality is confidential with Dr heart health we work as a team so Dr eight, and I can exchange information, but any outside party would need your consent."
16700.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely yeah I think i'm i'm very button into the overall concept that that we're working as a team, and you and Dr alligator are working together to. improve my my overall livelihood and where i'm going into the future, so I want to thank you just just you know, taking that that step to really Thank you and Dr hall again for taking the time. And then I do realize that everything we talked about is going to be very confidential, so I do really appreciate that that bubble."
705.0,Provider,right and it does create that bubble that's. where you can speak freely and you don't have to edit and it's just like you know. Just being able to get it out and sometimes just putting words to what your thoughts are.
16700.0,Patient,It helps a lot yeah I completely understand.
705.0,Provider,"So what I always like to add, before we get going. Any questions before we get going."
16700.0,Patient,"um I don't think I have any questions, it feels like my overall process is pretty good, it seems like i'm going to be meeting with you every other week, hopefully, unless I I feel like I haven't need to. escalate things and then it sounds like I will potentially be able to be with you every every week. I want to take a step back and say that with my overall i've announced this with Dr yet as well, but with my overall struggles, I do feel like i'm Okay, with the alcohol and the marijuana usage that that i'm currently. going through, and I feel like the best way to improve my overall livelihood is to spend a little bit more time with with you as the therapist. Because I do feel like the reason I got into alcohol, and the reason I got into marijuana in the first place was more kind of internal struggles and internal issues, so I do feel like therapy as a whole is going to be able to help you out. to grow as a person, and so, if it's possible to make the request I would love to potentially be able to meet with you, every week, rather than every other week and then i'm happy to work through any other issues to be like. Potentially move things into the future, just so that we're able to have the one on one time with me individually."
705.0,Provider,"that's great, and thank you, Jonathan, for you know to me it's like this is about you i'm here to to guide and. So I am glad that you're advocating for yourself and yes let's start off every you know we'll meet every week let's take you because that's good especially early in recovery. yeah well awesome. Okay, what are some of the reasons you decided to join reinhardt hell."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah so I explained, Dr Ali get I think there's there's two main reasons, so one of them is more of a personal one where I do you feel like i'm. In my past like four or five years, I had been struggling with substance abuse and alcohol abuse, and I would like to kind of fix that into the future and so fortunately i've been doing a great job in in kind of making. Impact there, but I think the second reason that I wanted to come was more of a. legal issue, and so I did express this but, again, and I unfortunately at the end of October I ran into an issue with the dui, and so I made some poor decisions and I actually. Unfortunately, got into an accident with some other folks and so part of the reason that i'm here is for that do you lie and to. Hopefully, make some changes. To make sure that the next time this this is never gonna happen again, and so one of the asks I have for you and, as well as for Dr elegant is. Potentially to keep track of our meetings to those let the dependent potential judge who's going to be taking a look at the case. to let them know that hey i've been making progress and i've been working on the issues that have. led to the overall dui that that caused the issue in the first place, and so. My meeting with the judges in late January, and so I think we have plenty time, but I would like to for the next few weeks, just to work closely with you as well. As with Dr again to make sure that i'm i'm on track and that i'm not going to be doing anything that will be potentially harmful for the rest of the folks kind of in the area, so sorry that kind of spring that one you, but I just wanted to be super transparent on unwind here. Firstly, is it's mainly for my own benefit. But secondly I am trying to do work that the job has recommended and my attorney has."
705.0,Provider,weight and sometimes Kenneth we need external motivation to make those changes. yeah it's not fun getting a dui.
16700.0,Patient,"Unfortunately yeah it's not yeah, but I do feel like this is the the low, I would say the lowest. point of my life so far and I will not like to have a similar experience in the future, and so I think my core goal for working with you and Mr. Dr Hall, again, is to make sure that in the future, I never have to go, you know experienced something like this is the future so happily very, very, very on board with any any suggestions and any recommendations that you have to. make progress here."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely Kenneth and you're not alone other people to are needing court documents, and so what I asked is you know at least a couple of weeks before you know you're going to have to go to court. is to rock remind me, and then we have a department that helps me we're hill construct is usually del mar and he'll reach out to you as long as we have like let's say you need something directly sent to the courts, sometimes different courthouses. They like different things, the. Judge requirements. Sometimes it's okay if we send it to you, and then you can decide who you want to see it or not, and. your attendance and just like a brief of what you've been doing. yep um if your judge those says no, they want it directly to such and such court. Then you would need to sign that release of information to consent. And then we'd be able to do that and so it's. Absolutely no it'll be nice will be on bright heart health letterhead. It usually will say this is how many it's very general, because they don't need to know all your business."
16700.0,Patient,"Right exactly exactly. So i'm hoping for it. I want to keep it general because. Like I feel like this right her health information is just for me personally. But I do realize that the judge wants like something extra so I want to provide the extra but at the same time, I do want to work on my. My individual issues with we just seems like i'm going to be able to be with you, so I do really appreciate, thank you."
705.0,Provider,"And usually to the drugs just wanted to know liability wise like. you're doing we're liability wise they're they're okay with you know you're not spending time in jail you're going to not be on probation because liability wise, you are attending so many individual sessions attending so. Many groups, you know, being able to take a look at all this so So yes, that's not a problem at all Kenneth that is part of what we can do. As far as than some of the things that that you wish to learn, while you're at right heart. Health what are what are a couple of things that you wish to learn."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm just taking a few steps back and you feel like my main priorities was was trying to reach out to you as a therapist in general, because I was hoping to. rely less on the medication that perhaps Dr alia will provide me i'm currently or I guess taking a few steps back so I had my accident on October 27. And so that was the last day I had taken a drink so so thankfully, for me, I was able to get over the the alcohol. addiction that that I potentially had and that's something that I, I feel like I had trouble with before. But it wasn't until this this like unfortunately it was, until this incident that really made me realize that like I need to take another look at you know how i'm doing in life and want to take the next steps and so. Thankfully i've been great at doing sobriety since October 27 so i've been okay on the alcohol front, I had been worried that because of my consumption and my you know tolerance. I was worried that I was going to get into the very, very dangerous withdrawal symptoms of alcohol, but thankfully I feel like i've gone through that gap, and I am okay. So i'm doing okay. in regards to that alcohol, the struggle that I currently have is with. marijuana use and so after my accident on the 27th I think two weeks after I was still like I actually internalize myself from the seat belt and just be there all the crash, so my body was a little bit injured. And so I had taken two months, or like the two weeks afterwards to unfortunately self medicate with with marijuana. And so I was using marijuana during that time, but fortunately, since thanksgiving I have stopped the marijuana use, and I would like to continue to stop the marijuana as well as the I call us into the future and so. My first feedback to Dr Al again last week was that because I had just started my tolerance and stoppage of all the drugs, and I was unfortunately experiencing some withdrawal symptoms, so I was having a lot of insomnia. As well as just feeling a little bit like. My emotions, I had I feel like I had been hiding for so many years, but now my emotions are coming out a little bit more into the general sense, and so I feel like I have a hard time. Number one controlling my emotions, as well as number two sleeping so in so many has been been a big issue, but I do realize with with the overall. marijuana withdrawal usage that it seems to be normal with with you know people. Taking a break so i'm uncomfortable with it, I do realize it's going to be a little bit uncomfortable for a few weeks, but i'm i'm you know set to be like, I want to be free of all the substance abuse, and so I want to make a path forward to me, to make sure i'm i'm okay. With how things are going, and so that's where I am currently I have another meeting scheduled with Dr holly had tomorrow to kind of give her an update on how i'm feeling. Since last week and so i've been completely drug free and marijuana free since last week, but it has been a little bit difficult on the sleeping aspect so otherwise, aside from the sleeping aspect I think i've been doing."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, great great and some of what you're talking about to Kenneth is acute withdrawal syndrome it usually does dissipate in time. But it takes time and so yeah that that's what I understand is what it sounds."
16700.0,Patient,"Like it's going to take me at least like a week or a month or perhaps two months to fully get rid of all the symptoms, so it internally i've been trying to internalize the idea to realize that oh yeah sleeping for the next few weeks is going to be kind of shitty. But i'm working towards it in the past few days has been okay. i've been sleeping about like four or five hours a week, rather than the two three hours that I had previously. And so it does seem like things are moving in the positive direction, and so one of the reasons I was hoping to keep in touch with you as well as Dr l again it's to kind of keep you guys up to date on, you know how i'm doing and how i'm before."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I would say to that is just you know be mindful be kind to yourself, there could be times that you're more irritable or you find that you know different emotions like you said, are kind of one way or the other that's normal. it's like being able to like you're doing now is talking about it and being like you know what I know this is going to have an ending to where it's not always going to be like the the level of irritability is up here it's going to dissipate and time."
16700.0,Patient,"Yes, that's my hope so far so i've just been telling myself, though, like know if you feel angry right now it's it's okay it's part of the process of healing. And so i'm hoping that, like in a few months, I think that the main goal is that in a month or two, I want to be at a level playing field, rather than feeling like I still need to. kind of overcome some challenges here, so I would love to work with you closely as well, like it to make sure i'm on the right track."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely concentration is one to Canada to know that sometimes if you're if you're not able to concentrate as much, and you lose focus. yeah can be to with pause and so just know what post acute withdrawal that's not going to be always that way and stealing time if you need to create your system of reminders on your phone. Right things out, and you know just where you have knowledge that Oh, this is what that's going on, if you're angry always say called. If your tongue it halt is eight for hunger. And then the a for anger mouth for lonely and tea for tired, so if you're hungry. and eat. If you're angry then do something that's going to release some tension and exercise meditation. If you're lonely being able to socialize and if you're tired being able to rest your body in that you know if you can take a nap you might night if you're working and they might not be like oh yeah go ahead and take a nap."
16700.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely yeah. yeah I love that the plus one here and I just wanted to say that I really do appreciate you taking the time to to care for me and work through all my issue, so thank you so much Valerie I. look forward to working with you my pleasure Ken, and again I was excited when I saw that you were coming in today and I knew that you're going to be in that Wednesday I hope."
705.0,Provider,I call her Dr amy I was.
16700.0,Patient,"Like yes, it says."
705.0,Provider,"look forward to that yeah so what i'm going to do too and you're going to see me look to the side i'm looking. At my guidelines here. So i'm reading off a to your history questionnaire so again, thank you for filling that out, you went over the last days that you used, and then I like to go over with alcohol, the first age you used was when you were 21."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah it was around when I was so this ran college, so I actually had quite a good upbringing from from the family side, where my family was quite stringent on you know being being a good. person and kind of not not really using any drugs, so it wasn't until I went to college and I kind of split off from my family that that I was starting to to kind of use and abuse, a cold."
705.0,Provider,"So the marijuana came at the same time was there any other drug use, during your your college, you know when you start it like any stimulants like cocaine crack methamphetamine any oh."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah so so nothing, nothing too strenuous the, the main thing I had abused. During that time was alcohol and I did use up a little bit acid from from time to time, but I don't think it's been enough that it would impact any of the changes that i've seen."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, would you say then candidate, the use of asset was like maybe."
16700.0,Patient,"It was just once just once, and then I realized, it was her biggest fan, and so I had stopped using it don't don't wait until the main sources of abuse would probably be BBB i'll call."
705.0,Provider,"Okay. Thank you, and then with family history, no family history of psychiatric disorders or substance use disorders and it looks like to you wrote that biological mom and biological Father for who raised, you know abuse no physical, sexual or emotional. And right now, where do you live."
16700.0,Patient,"I live with my family actually so i'm back in California. I had moved recently from Seattle, where I had spent the last four years. And, but unfortunately the work in Seattle was a bit up, especially with the coven timeframe and just the general with with my abuse and kind of things. I wasn't up to scratch for the Seattle work, so I had taken a break from from what I was working in Seattle and now i'm working remotely for a. tech company so i'm still working as in my previous role as a product manager for a tech company that that's currently 100% remote so i'm luckily able to stay home here with my family and in California."
705.0,Provider,"Well, great i'm glad that you have that support to and that you're able to work from home and i'm looking to it looks like single and no children."
16700.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
705.0,Provider,"And no, no, but you never been a victim of domestic violence nope Okay, and for school, you have your BA your bs never in the military."
16700.0,Patient,nope nope.
705.0,Provider,you're employed and then leisure you like reading walking playing games yeah okay yeah.
16700.0,Patient,that's still the same leisure activities.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, video games board games all of it."
16700.0,Patient,"Both I used to play video games, a lot more when I was in the Seattle area, but I feel like i've transitioned off of video games into more in person name so i've been playing a lot more board games and those. type of games where where you got to interact a little bit more with with."
705.0,Provider,"And then going back to substance use two years before you became sober before the accident. Yes, how much were you drinking like within a within a month like was it every week."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah so I wanted to make a clarification because I feel like my drinking habits had been very recent so it was right up to the. point where I had the accident, where I was drinking a lot more frequently, whereas previously, I was more of a. Every other week where I would only drink for special occasions, whereas the the overall cool good and just isolation made me a little bit more hesitant for that and so during the time right before the extra I was drinking about 200 milliliters of 40%. A day. And so that that was my my baseline for."
705.0,Provider,saying thank you for clarifying that Kenneth what i'm going to do to then is switch over to you know other types of like.
16700.0,Patient,"Gambling have yes, yes yeah yeah. feel free to ask me any questions i'm happy to help you here."
705.0,Provider,Great any concerns with gambling.
16700.0,Patient,"know so I don't gamble at all, and I think gambling is likely, one of the areas where I don't touch."
705.0,Provider,"Okay. Any concerns with eating disorder, where you might withhold. Food or you might have been junk food."
16700.0,Patient,"i'm, not that I, I have, I know, during the period, it was a lot easier to. get food just in general, like delivery wise and so I was living off of more of it and the rule wise kind of standard. Where I wasn't really looking at the amount of money i'm spending, where I just wanted to care about the food, I was getting, and so I was trying to. Look at you know I didn't care about the price, so I was just looking at you know, overall, protein and overall carbohydrates, and so I did spend about two years just ordering strictly off of. I guess your phone, and so I did live about two years living off of other food that was provided from third parties."
705.0,Provider,"Would you say now, though Kenneth that you're eating a little bit healthier and."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah yeah definitely yeah as as soon as I moved back home i've been very, very healthy looking at carbs proteins and. Everything in terms of my overall growth so previously when I was living in Seattle, I gained about 30 pounds and, unfortunately, so I went from 162 about 190. Unfortunately, now i'm back down to 160 so i'm at like a healthy weight, so I don't feel like eating disorders, is going to be an issue moving forward."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you, do you um do you use any nicotine products. Okay let's see to and you already went through with sharing about what withdrawals that you're you're going through any previous hospitalizations for any surgeries or. Do you need for grooming or hygiene, meaning like washing you know or taking a shower you need any assistance like no assistance some assistance."
16700.0,Patient,No assistance okay.
705.0,Provider,"Have you been to before any type of a rehabilitation Center for. Okay, any past history of. going to a facility for psychiatric reasons."
16700.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,Have you ever had a mental health disorder diagnosis.
16700.0,Patient,"I had into PT where I was working with some Sarah therapists where they diagnosed me for overall depression. But I felt like that was kind of a. theme moving on when when I move into Seattle, so I feel like the diagnosis of depression is probably the only thing that they had reached."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you and then next what we do is it's more of a suicide risk. assets. Assessment says hi and so have you ever experienced thoughts about hurting yourself. Okay, any past suicide attempts. Okay, as far as any non suicidal self injurious behavior like burning yourself. What creates meaning in your life and why is it important for you to stay alive."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah so so previously it had been been my family, but now i'm hoping to find a little bit more concrete like. interests, because I don't know what exactly is driving me to kind of make steps into the next version, so I think this is an area I would love to dive in on. With you personally, as a nervous because right now i'm not too sure what what exactly is driving me and I feel like this is an area you as it there, as well as affect all again, we would find benefit in diving a little bit deeper."
705.0,Provider,"Quite. As far as then homicidal thoughts of hurting someone else have you ever had. Any access to weapons guns in the House. Thank you, I know some of these questions."

16700.0,Patient,"yeah I have a close friend I guess high school friends that I still keep in touch with we've gone through like college and just work. And so it feels like everyone's kind of on the same page, and so I do reach out to them, so I would say college friends high school friends are still very close and I do keep a close touch with them. family is also another thing, although I don't fully share I guess everything with with a family, but the the areas where I do feel more comfortable sharing I do absolutely."
705.0,Provider,"And, if anything, ever changes, you know kind of where he do start to fill suicidal. We just said that said yeah."
16700.0,Patient,I will let you know you and Dr Gallagher would be the first to know if I ever feel a little bit under the weather and less them I use.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and there's a couple of resources to and I always give them to everyone is now with the Suicide Prevention hotline it's 988 if you can't remember 988 you just call 911. And they'll patch you through also to there is a text, if you like, to text there's a 741741 it's a crisis text fine you don't have to be suicidal it's a it's a crisis counselor 24 seven. you're having a blog day it's two o'clock in the morning, you want to talk to someone you can text so 741741.

16700.0,Patient,yeah yeah they switched to doctor I do appreciate the offer.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and as far as then, with alcohol, did you ever experience any blackouts like the next day you couldn't recall."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah luckily I haven't gone through that or I would have to give you a little bit more and more I guess context, on my overall abuse. I feel like it didn't really start until I had moved into Seattle, and so this was about three four years ago, when I was living by myself in Seattle and so. I had my own apartment everything and so because I was just isolated kind of that was the reason that I had started drinking a little bit more than usual. And so I definitely feel like during that time I had gone above and beyond the the tolerance level that I had normally, and so I was able to drink a little bit more than than I had typically, and so I feel like that's the start of my overall dependency."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, for you to you know I know you said you started drinking more and more where you haven't had in the morning, sometimes people call it an eye opener where you had to drink first thing in the."
16700.0,Patient,"I don't feel like that became an issue until very recently devil like three four months ago where because I had early morning meetings I was just like oh. Look at a drink in me to kind of get through the meetings so I was at a down place during that time, towards the end of the copy period, I would say 2021 maybe mid 2021 So this was June, July."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you did any of your family or close friends ever share with you like they were worried or complained about your awful phone."
16700.0,Patient,"But no, no, unfortunately, I was pretty good at. kind of hiding it with the rest of the family and the folks that I had been close with so they didn't realize that that we had an issue until. recently."
705.0,Provider,Do you are have you in the past ever felt guilty about your alcohol use or your marijuana you.
16700.0,Patient,"know not necessarily until I guess very recently where where I like I realized I had gone down the wrong path, but previously I hadn't really given thought. To those aspects I was more just concerned about my myself and just thinking more on the personal level rather than do what I was going to be able to impact."
705.0,Provider,"Is there been a time candidate that you neglect at your obligations such as work like call it, you know, had to call them because your home over. Our were not able to do the responsibility."
16700.0,Patient,"For sure unfortunate I don't think there was any particular moment where I had you know felt bad enough or I was able to call it work and let them know it's going bad, so I had pretty much been just hiding it high ticket with a work group and didn't really see anything. For my day to day."
705.0,Provider,"After any of using alcohol like a night where you've used, you know a lot of alcohol, have you ever had like severe shaking or visual or auditory hallucinations."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah luckily I don't think I had done to the point where, where I was physically reliance and clinical so I don't think i've ever experienced any."
705.0,Provider,"And as far as then. Where I know you had shared is one of the questions I asked to is Have you ever placed your life in danger. By using alcohol and I know, sometimes people overlook driving under the influence yeah and that wasn't and what was that October of this."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah that was that was. October 27 of this, and so I feel like that was hopefully the the lowest point of my life and I never want to kind of. Experience something like that, again, and so that was October of 27 and I was driving with a dui."
705.0,Provider,Have you had where you've gone to any of the anonymous groups like alcohol anonymous for and there's marijuana anonymous.
16700.0,Patient,"yeah so so after my accident, I had been you know it really just kind of should be as as. At the core and I realized, you know I needed to take the next steps to really benefit myself to make sure I don't get back into this so after the accident, I had been attending at as well as me. Every day, and so I have a four o'clock. Meeting or 430 meeting I might miss the one today because i'm chatting with you, but other other days, I do have a four o'clock meeting with with the a group, supposedly in a group, where I do check in. and make sure you know we're on pace, and so I feel like it's been very helpful for me, since ever since my accident on the 27th i've been. Completely sober and so I was very worried that you know, without call the draws I I do hear that you know alcohol draws could have a be in back corner, where it impacts your body um but luckily I wasn't able to get through any Johnson, and so I feel like i'm i'm okay."
705.0,Provider,"Well, good and i'm glad that, then you already have experienced with self help groups."
16700.0,Patient,"And yes, yes."
705.0,Provider,yeah and there's different ones to see there's a lot of the anonymous groups there's also to like smart recovery as far as like a cognitive and you're familiar with smart recovery.
16700.0,Patient,"yeah i've heard of it, yet, but I haven't been engaged yet i've been mainly engaging with a meetings every day."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that's where sometimes you know, sometimes people are like you know what only want to do like one like a one of the anonymous groups. Your sometimes they may use a couple of different ones, sometimes people may use a little bit of smart recovery to is more cognitive base then there's also two we have. A lot of different types of recovery there's a Christian base there's a Buddha base there's more of a natural nature based recovery, so no matter what you know. A person can get where they feel like they're a better match, and this certain self help group so. If you need resources are interested in anything like that, let me know. Yes, no. Are you thinking about I know and in the rooms, the a rooms, a lot of times they talk about having a sponsor. Have."
16700.0,Patient,"I don't have a sponsor right now, but I do feel like just for my own. I guess drive and what i'm looking to accomplish I feel like i've been doing pretty well with. Ross things so group, and so I haven't had a drink since October 27 and I I haven't had any wheat usage, since the last week and so with Dr elegant and as well as with you. i'm hoping, one of the areas of improvement is making sure I stay on this Friday path and so i'm hoping for our kind of a weekly check in just to make sure you know. i'm doing well on myself as as well as i'm i'm not experiencing too much of the withdrawal symptoms, so there was draw symptoms, have been the biggest point of pain. For the past few few kind of days and and the week um but I realized just from reading other anecdotes of how others who have abused alcohol. In the past, their overall timeline for recovery and it just feel like it's going to be kind of a two month three month kind of process before I kind of get myself back to what will say back to normal."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's good that you know, and you know I forgot to ask you at the at the beginning, do you prefer to be called I know, sometimes people like to become Kenneth."
16700.0,Patient,Kenny yeah. Have happy to have for you to call me that'd be great Thank you so much.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
16700.0,Patient,"Sorry, I usually ask that, no, no worries at all."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, but you prefer Kenny yeah okay great um so with anything I know i've been asking a lot of."
16700.0,Patient,Question No.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, is there, other things I haven't asked that you feel like some important for bright heart health to know in order to work with you, better Kenny."
16700.0,Patient,"um I I don't think so, I feel like you've made only asked about my my overall kind of history with drug abuse and I feel like that that is probably the main thing I would like to cover with with brighter health and. Just to give you a little bit background my own previously, I had realized that you know I wasn't happy all the time, and I wanted to kind of go over depression and just feeling kind of down. All the time and so previously in 2018 I had reached out to other providers other third party kind of vendors to kind of take a look at. Depression and just you know holistically, how do you feel it wasn't until the potential accident that I had this unit, when I really realized that Okay, I need to take another next step. into making sure that you know that the next step is going to last a longer time than in the previous ones, so. that's where I am currently I had previously worked with other therapists and help console in the past um but because of the I guess the the way that it was organized it didn't seem like it was a long term prospects, it was more of kind of a two three month. exercise to make sure you're kind of feeling well, and so I was hoping for a longer term kind of check it for me to make sure that."
705.0,Provider,"Kenny i'm glad you're bringing that up because there's some people that have been with bright heart. Health for like a couple of years i'm working with one gentleman that's still sober and he likes to come in, like he started weekly he would work with with you know the counselor back then weekly and then he's been here now. You know where it went twice a month and then monthly and then he sees every three months and he's doing really well, so he just uses it kind of his analogy is like a car that needs a tune up becomes an end. To check in yeah so great great do you want to see to then Kenny, I can how we work in the schedule. Is scheduling our appointments is when you and I work together, we can just schedule our next appointment. If you prefer, though, you can also to go to the virtual Center a lot of times, people like to do that too, but I like to offer where, if you would prefer, we can do that now and set up your next individual session."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah i'm happy to set up the next session I feel like the main feedback I had from Dr Ali get was that I I do realize I did have an issue with. marijuana and alcohol, but i've been making really good steps on my own to kind of. do that, but I feel like the reason I had picked up those two in the first place was more kind of individual on on my own. Issues right for like therapy and just talking to a therapist would benefit me more than just taking kind of medication or whatnot to kind of get through the urges and so i'm in a state where I would love to kind of take advantage of any therapy time. That we have together. And then i'm still happy to kind of make all the group appointments that that are required as part of the brain health. schedule um, but I do feel like on my own personal level, I would it feels like I would benefit more just from a one on one session with you or i'll get just to kind of let you guys know how i'm feeling and what the next steps."
705.0,Provider,"sounds good, then, do you prefer then Kenny, you know, when I look at next week, do you prefer a certain day of the week, well, we we normally don't like it since will be working together on Wednesday we normally don't do two services on the same day, I know. yeah we could. You know, look at a Thursday it looks like on Thursday the 16th i'm just looking through the calendar here. On the 16th I would have a six o'clock appointment that one's kind of later and if I look at Friday I would have a four o'clock appointment, if you like."
16700.0,Patient,"And I can make the so just to give you an overall and because of the dui that I had experienced i'm going to be taking to you why school, which happens every Thursday for me so i'm. Unfortunately, from 70. I think nine ish every Thursday i'm going to be intending to do is wanted to kind of make sure I go through all the processes. And so I think the Wednesday date that you had mentioned or the Friday date that you had mentioned would likely be better for me, I do work. So the companies, I work for is located in Chicago so that they work, usually from nine to five Chicago time so. In terms of since I live in California, that means I usually work from nine to three on weekdays and so as long as it's past 3pm on Wednesdays I should be able to talk to me so and so i'm happy to work my schedule around what."
705.0,Provider,"Do you want to go then on December, the 17th Friday, would you be able to make, then a four o'clock."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah I should be able to make the 17th four o'clock appointment, just as a follow up for discussion."
705.0,Provider,"Right, so what i'll do is i'll go ahead and put this in to your calendar that I have and then we'll make that on the 17th at 4pm that will be our individual session."
16700.0,Patient,"awesome okay Thank you so much Valerie and then just to give you an update on I will be meeting with Dr hall again tomorrow. um, so I think I have another follow up session with her, and then the plan is, I will be looking to join the group sessions on Wednesday, so I think i'll be hopefully joining the group on Wednesdays, and then it sounds like we'll be having our follow up on Fridays."
705.0,Provider,"Right and what I like to do so, we have the 17th and then I always like to check to Kenny, just to see if you have anything else in the appointment. Just to look over so i'm going to bring up your calendar. And so, when I look now. Yes, you, you have tomorrow that follow up at 130 with Dr a and then on the 16th you'll have the group."
16700.0,Patient,"Oh. I see I think i'll need to work, the team to move the 16th into the 15th because I have a conflict on the 16th and I will be able to make. Some so i'll let Dr a note, as well as them the brighter help folks know that i'm not going to be able to make the 16th and, hopefully, to be able to transition into the the meeting on the 15."
705.0,Provider,"All right, right and I get i'm glad we're going over this can you. See when I said the 16th that's a Thursday. yeah good already said you wanted to do the Wednesday so."
16700.0,Patient,"there's yes, yes."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so I will then let them know that to that. you'd be and that would be super helpful, thank you."
16700.0,Patient,"So much. And it sounds like you, you actually work quite closely with Dr eight, and so the information that I share with Dr K i'm assuming will hopefully be shared with you as well. Or is there a nothing."
705.0,Provider,"Right, what we do is we work together Kenny, and so, not only to Dr Ray and I run the groups together, and then we talk, you know afterwards, just to. To see where care intensity, where we have the different things to make sure that everyone is able to do their surveys and stuff like that. And then, if any, things you know come up that we need to consult on as far as so Kenny well I usually keep it is. Dr a has access to my notes, I have like the limited of her notes, because on a doctors who a lot of times we we have the view to see, like most of it in there. So there is a continuation of care where you don't have to feel like every time you have to tell your story over and over again. So, even today, you know after our session, Dr a could come back and see kind of some of the things that we highlighted and talked about today. Where you know, for her, she gets a better picture, too, I know, for me, a lot of times so Kenny is. I like to see to because maybe today, you and I talked about something, but you a doctor a talk another day you might have some extra additional information or you might have yeah so just know sometimes if a repetitive question comes in that's where we're just seeing."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah no worries no hard feelings here, I know you're just trying to get the. best out of me so that you could provide the best of you so happy to accommodate."
705.0,Provider,"Right and then, if ever, you have a question can you just let me know i'll do my best to answer it if I don't know i'll find out who does know and we'll go from there and. I appreciate that you came in today, and then I got to know you and then i'll See you in our Wednesday group so i'm going to put that. In and free and then we'll go from."
16700.0,Patient,"There, yes yeah look forward to it, so it sounds like my my next step is, I will be attending to Wednesday groups, and so, hopefully, you end up. going to be there."
705.0,Provider,"As well right right. yeah and so i'm with your individual groups to just like you did today just go ahead and check in with the virtual Center that way they can tell you, if there's any. surveys that maybe you didn't see that can let you know about that and then that way, we keep your attendance where it's almost like a double check. Like I guess yeah so it's like yes, I know, can he was here. But then, also the virtual Center puts on my calendar that you attended it makes a note of it we're when you're needing it for court, we can be very accurate, because we have. To do for people. keeping track so you're also a piece of that, by checking in with the virtual Center."
16700.0,Patient,"awesome. Okay yeah I did I did want to give an overall plus one to the other court issue I don't know how much the information, like the judges will actually need. But for my attorney they did mention that as i'm kind of seeking treatment and just looking to improve my own my overall life. My attorney mentioned that it would be very helpful if you as well as Dr Elliot would be able to help us right, just like a quick summary of hey i've been. Looking to improve my my by my situation since the date and then i've been kind of constantly making improvements over our meetings so. My Court meeting isn't until the end of January, and so I don't think i'll have an ask for your doctor again until maybe mid January, but I just want to give you a heads up that I potentially may be asking for a potential. Quick note, just to let the judge note that hey i've been making it actually progress in our meetings here. yeah so Okay, I do deeply appreciate that thank."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely Kenny, and we do have a form that we use for the court system. And so it is showing their progress, no progress and again we keep it. Pretty general because we want them to know that, yes, that you're making progress, but we don't want them to really know the details of what but we could you know. yeah place for notes and so sometimes like. Someone was Center for court reasons for anger management, so I write on each time which chapter, we covered I don't talk about anything else, but I do let them know yes we're covering what he said."
16700.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah yeah so so just to give you a little bit more background of I think the reason the Court wants me to have a little bit of information is because of the call abuse. Where I feel like this is a weird topic because, as I had described with Dr again. The reason for my alcohol abuse was kind of stems in from more of a internal reason, where now that I get with alcohol abuse. I still want the judge to know that you know i've been making progress you're, even though the internal issues is a little bit less connected to the director of abuse and more so my my own feelings if that makes sense, so i'm happy to give you a little bit more information."
705.0,Provider,"It absolutely does, and I appreciate that Kenny, it is because if you start to take a look at some of the reasons behind it and it's usually to escape from are definitely escaping and just feeling like."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's where I was and I I would love to help with you to. Stop self medicating and. To kind of work through the the actual issues rather than just kind of pushing them to the side with you know, a piece that."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I again appreciate you come in and Kenny, and so, then I will see you Wednesday."
16700.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,"And our group and, until then, you know if you wanted to what I asked people usually to do if you're up for it to do, like a timeline and it's just like draw a straight line and then, if you can think of like when you started to use. And then sketch like when you notice that up to where you were starting to use more. kind of just highlight that, and you don't have to write it down if. you're better with this like keeping it in the memory bank. robbery that too, and just to see if we can see like what were the patterns and what we were going through like a lot of times. A person's us might have pete when they were going through, it sounds or maybe they went through a breakup and it helps highlight like okay let's look at this that's where it was where then sometimes if someone has like a death in the family and it's the anniversary of."
16700.0,Patient,yo.
705.0,Provider,"yo, we know that we're more mindful they're like Okay, what can we put in place to support that person during that difficult time to."
16700.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I love this because I do feel like I have a. kind of a reason or road that of where I got to where I am, and so I would happily share that with you next week, so it sounds like we'll have a meeting next. Friday."
705.0,Provider,Next Friday and that will be at four.
16700.0,Patient,or four o'clock right perfect.
705.0,Provider,"yeah that's. Our individual session, but I will see before that."

705.0,Provider,"out to the care navigators So if you get a call to our contact you know come to the virtual Center they might be just need to. break through the to the Wednesday group, but I couldn't make it happen on my end and we'll get you in that Wednesday one because i'm looking forward to."
16700.0,Patient,"Having right yeah Thank you so much better I do appreciate all your time today, I feel like i've learned a lot and I do. Have a kind of next step for our meeting next week so look very much look forward to it, I will be attending the group session on Wednesday, and I will be taking the doctor a minus one so. I will happily let you know and keep you up to date on any changes here, so they use so much Dr Valerie."
