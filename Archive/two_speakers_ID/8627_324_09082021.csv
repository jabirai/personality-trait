I went and did water aerobics this morning with my grandma and my mom. And they the gym has like a sauna and a steam room so in there, so i'm feeling pretty good in this moment I gotta say. um but i'm trying to exercise and move my body, because I realized we you know.

I also kind of feel like i'm getting my appetite back i'm like i've been able to like properly eat. Like.

324.0,Provider,you're welcome.
8627.0,Patient,"um yeah I feel like i'm sleeping pretty well, I still take my melatonin. which I hope is okay. i'm sorry yeah I still take melatonin and i'm trying to just have a better routine and sleep, I found like I it's like I just. am ready to go to sleep much earlier, like my body is. Just like you're done. And i'm able to fall asleep at like 10 3011 o'clock and then i've always needs an alarm to wake up and now it's like I just wake up. Every day at like seven or 730 and i'm just like awake it's so amazing i've never experienced that so it's like it's putting me on just it feels like my brain is just like on the schedule with the medication that's a little different but it's kind of Nice. yeah when I feel like I am able to sleep through the night, which i've never really had a problem with but I mean I feel like i'm falling asleep pretty easily. i'm still have a couple nights where I like accidentally kind of stay up too late, but it's never like all through the night like I haven't had a night, where I stay up to like 5am it's like oh it's one whoops and that's my fault, because I was like watching netflix. So he doesn't feel like it's like you know my anxiety keeping me up it's just like stimulant. So. um yeah. yeah The only other thing that's kind of still happening in terms of side effects is like it does feel like right so i'm having some headaches that I kind of always have headaches, because I have like neck and jaw pain and problems and I have a history of migraines. So it's really hard to like know what's causing a headache because I kind of at least have a headache. that's kind of the only side in fact that i'm still really noticing otherwise, like, I can tell my stomach is kind of adjusting and feeling better and um. yeah. um I have a headache almost every day. But I kind of like I was saying, like i've always sort of had that it's I think it's primarily because I have. A lot of neck and jaw pain. So yeah. But typically if I just take you know ibuprofen or something it's fine and it goes away so. yeah."
