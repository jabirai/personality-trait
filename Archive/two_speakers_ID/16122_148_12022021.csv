148.0,Provider,"Good morning, everyone. How are you."
16122.0,Patient,i'm. not good.
148.0,Provider,Okay.
16122.0,Patient,"So there was something I. kind of wanted to talk with you that happened yesterday. And this is really hard for me to talk about because, like i've i've run into this thing before with other doctors in like. it's been like you know you can flip a coin. As to whether they. You know we're actually helpful or not. um. So yesterday Israel morning I had my appointment with the. The boutique it was like a survey thing with where I had to rank stuff and it was like motivational surveys or motivational style or something and. If that was extremely triggering for me. Basically kind of just sum up my the extent of my trauma and the other thing is like I really don't want to talk about my. Like these specifics or anymore, I want to talk about like how do I get out of a dissociative state or you know, like how do I call myself down, you know that type of thing because the only way to really resolve my trauma at this point would be er. But just to kind of sum up like the extent what I suffered like a really good analogy would Are you familiar with dd bland shard and gypsy rose blanchard. Okay, you should definitely look look them up a dd blanchard was a mother with. It like the Louisiana area with she suffered from lunch thousands by proxy. And she deliberately sickened her daughter. You know, made her physically disabled. For money attention sympathy, you know, support and. I didn't her daughter's name is chips is gypsy rose flip chart gypsy rose blend chart is is. is now serving. Like a 10 year sentence for. Because I. haven't murdered my mom but I mean thing is is like it was it's basically like you know this team is dd blanchard was basically forcing her daughter to. Like parading around is you know, a cancer survivor you know, like you know deliberately sickening her malnutrition like really, really bad and it wasn't caught because I mean. Literally it was I mean it was a really bad situation okay to give me idea my mother. Is the mental health slash autism version of dd blanchard. Literally my entire life has been a lot. Like. You know in I am so that is actually a a gimmick comparison. Like so I have been seeing i've been seen doctors i've been psycho analyze every single like normal childhood behavior. has been blown out of proportion medicalized i've had my i've been psychoanalyze since I was three years old i've been so having to answer some of those questions that were on this test yesterday, I mean it wasn't past but it felt like it. And as a child and even as an adult I was not allowed to say no. And the same thing, like I literally told the monique that like this is making me uncomfortable like I don't want to do this and. She just like oh no don't worry, there are no wrong answers okay well i've literally been told that before by professionals and been locked up in a mental institution multiple times as a kid. So, and she monique did it confirmed to me that this the results were you know. just going to be shared with with you guys, but I want to make sure that. That invite you guys know that a that was perfect for me to go through. Because it's not like I can just like go find another doctor with my interests. Right. Right now, you know. And I don't want to you know, end up having to go cold Turkey off my beds. try to get my primary she won't do it so i'm kind of you guys just mercy regarding you know my medication, you are literally, the only people that accept my entrance it don't have a six month long waiting list to get seen. So I just really I mean this is it really messed me up yesterday."
148.0,Provider,i'm.
16122.0,Patient,And i'm a master at hiding my emotions and my master at like you know pretending everything's okay. But this was not okay.
148.0,Provider,"i'm okay Okay, and you were feeling unsupported when you were going through this."
16122.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean like it was the clinical director wasn't my therapist or anything, and I can do this, like so I basically just like went into. You know fun mode and just keep what she said, but like my skin has been crawling since yesterday, right it's really, really stressful, and this is the first time that I have ever like push back against this kind of thing. I mean it was already like a huge amount of stress earlier in our sessions, you know in with Dominique and also dominate my. psychiatrist and then with the scheduling people that I not be put in the group on the less dominate the dominick Cruz screwed by lunch she can. You know, guarantee that there aren't any personality disorder people in that group is that would actually do far more harm than good at this point. So it's like you know it's not like i'm trying to i'm not trying to ask for a special treatment i'm not trying i'm saying literally like. This like. It was it was just really stressful and I just kind of I felt like I was I didn't feel like a person. um I felt like I was being. Put in boxes put in check marks put like. And I really don't see some of the stuff was about like. Like motivation and things like that that I mean like i've always had my own motivations and it's really only been, since you know. This this summer, do you know when I escaped starting July 13 2021 that I could actually. Be myself, so the entire time during those surveys, I heard my mom's for in my head like you know how dare you want to help homeless people how dare you. You know, like your your dirty liberal euro blah blah blah, you know I I just for her just in my dad at some point to join in on those screaming in my head just. i'm already dealing with that because I decided i've always been religious, but I was never allowed to express my religion. You know, to worship God a rainy anyone other than my parents as my problem was is an atheist, and my mom's a lapsed Catholic who thinks like old religion is just brain malfunction and human stupidity. But like I on this past Sunday, I accepted Jesus Christ into my life like I in that has been incredibly beneficial to me. I found a church, that is actually founded by people who you know went to super gog you know dysfunctional churches and we're like hey this isn't the way you know, this is not what Jesus wanted they actually you know it's like wow I found some nice people I don't support people I. In the next day on Monday Sunday night I had a dream that my parents, but my bear that I couldn't wake up from that my parents were daily meet with cross and saying you want to worship Jesus, you know here's how you actually do it. So. Like. I really cannot be yesterday, I mean I. I wasn't expecting it, I thought it was just going to be like you know, are you attending your appointments on time, or you know or. You know how can we help with scheduling I had no idea if I hadn't know, and I, you know what it would be like I could have like talk with you about it, or I could is you know. worked out ahead of time like hey I know like we don't work out like is this just like an insurance thing or do you guys actually use this data. Because it's like it's an insurance thing that's easier for me to deal with. Because it's like okay nobody's actually paying attention to this, but I was told like this would factor into my treatment plan you guys, would you know and. And I just want to make sure that you guys don't factor in my treatment plan because chances are like the answers I gave or not even accurate. You know, because it's like I was in like. I tried to be true to myself but it's like when I go into fun mode I I tend to like to see what people I think people want to hear, so I mean I really don't remember like 90% of that appointment. So I. So I just want to really want to make it clear that, please do not form any diagnosis, or anything anything take it from the fact that it was so disturbing to me was actually more clinically relevant OK OK. So."
148.0,Provider,"You mentioned. So you mentioned a few things. and Dr therapy, we do have a therapist that does am Dr with bright heart, would you be interested in working with her."
16122.0,Patient,"um. The problem is that i've tried to do, or what a producer has tried to do em Dr with me over Tele health and it didn't work. It just for some reason, it does not in that's it was apparently a comment finding was the I the way, like. We tried like you know the headphone version we try it, you know it just it's. posits like I it's, like the previous I started in the previous therapies for Kobe. Who, we did like one session, and it was incredibly helpful, but I ended up like ugly crying out for the good disassociated attack and ugly cry like he had to like you know be physically present to help me, you know get out of office is. In a safe stable for my mind. So I so i'm kind of waiting until I mean like this is kind of like I don't want to do a vr with you guys, because I know you're entirely Tele health, but the whole point would be like that would be really helpful here would be, can you give me some. Like just concrete things that I can do to get out like of a. Of a. Of a if I start just associating or start like going into people pleasing mode to protect myself like how do I get out of that and how do I if somebody else's involved like you know how do I, how do I say like. Under like like what would be some boilerplate things that I could say that you know script you know that I could say like it beyond like hey I need a minute, because it won't be like, just like hey I needed, you know no amount of hey I need a minutes would have helped yesterday morning. So it's like there's a lot of this stuff is just so painful, there are no words for it."
148.0,Provider,um.
16122.0,Patient,"So it's really just I need to let other people know that like. It. You know that. That i'm not mad at them i'm not you know it's all like i'm mad, but I mean it's like i'm not that i'm just like I you know, like it like at work, if you know I can do it by like if I if I just like take somebody else's parking lot. If you know because i'm really the only one that work that likes parking lot. So it's like this that's an easy out, you know and, that being out in nature, being you know and everything but it's like if i'm like you know. Another doctor's appointment this. Definitely at the House for after. disappointment and. That is i'm getting treatment for a condition that my parents, most of my mom deliberately did not get me treatment for until it was too late um because it would lead to independence. So it was kind of like an indirect version of you know, physically crippling me. um. it's a doctor appointment, I had to basically you know. I don't I don't know exactly what I get to convince them that it was like I wanted, I was like. Basically, the PR I know it was like the perfect partner for like two years before I finally was allowed to get surgery. For sure business correction. and And I basically was like you know I promise that like I had to repeatedly promise that like yeah if I get my driver's license you know i'll be kicking you places i'll be. You know, getting groceries for you, you know, think about it, you know how you know the person who could drive you know if you know, would be a good thing for the family, you know. It was it took two years. And, by then, I hope the surgeon was kind of like whoa this is kind of sassy like you know, like you should have had the surgery done when you were 12 like. I introduced the same guy who diagnosed me when I was eight years old. we've congenital strabismus severe and he was like I told you guys, to come back here when she was 12 you know when her eyeballs at finished growing. So it's so different doctor, but basically that darker said I would because it had gone and treated for so long, I would need another surgery within five to 10 years and it's already been six and my vision is definitely impacted. So that's very stressful so you know so it's like basically just need a way to. Get out of my own head it's like I physically cannot like DNA truth or you know be alone or you know from with other people were. So do you have any advice on how to."
148.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it sounds like you're looking on guidance and how to set boundaries and just tools for your trauma I guess i'm just wondering, do you feel like it would be more beneficial for you to work with a trauma specific therapists."
16122.0,Patient,Well yeah I mean it's the I thought I thought you were I mean I told dominic's that I told the scheduling people felt like I needed to work with a trauma specific therapist about this way you work.
148.0,Provider,Okay okay. um so I actually specialize in. My certification is in drug and alcohol.
16122.0,Patient,"Oh, my God i'm. Oh, my good oh my God i'm so sorry I literally I did not know that I thought you were a trauma special. Just don't don't wonder, this is. yeah I mean I don't have a problem with. drugs or alcohol at all like this is like the mismatch of. Okay yeah. yeah. Oh, my God oh."
148.0,Provider,"that's Okay, because I also work with mental health and i'm getting licensed as a therapist currently so um that's okay Evan we'll just switch you over to somebody that's more that can help you more with the trauma piece right now."
16122.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that would be great. yeah cuz it's like. Oh, my gosh it's that kind of makes sense, I was like because that was coming in, is feeling like. Maybe a little bit too much for you or whatever, but like I want to be honest about that."
148.0,Provider,That right i'm glad that was. Important to get your needs met.
16122.0,Patient,Here yeah they told me that you were a trauma specific therapist.
148.0,Provider,mm hmm okay.
16122.0,Patient,"So I have no idea, maybe they they got you mixed up with somebody else I don't know I mean I don't know how much quantity based off with the scheduling department."
148.0,Provider,yeah. You had mentioned a group. To have you been putting a group yet.
16122.0,Patient,"No and that's The thing is, they want me to be in dominic's group because you know she's my psychiatrist but The thing is, is that I found out that it was gaining key and that's pretty much guaranteed to have people like my parents in it. You know and that's just at this point it's like i'm glad personality disorder, people are getting help I have nothing against them it's just it's personally. very, very."
148.0,Provider,triggering very.
16122.0,Patient,"very unfortunate yeah like i've had to cut out a couple like a couple of friends, you know just set a very hard boundaries say like hey you know. Like I have pulled a couple friends that. You know who are displaying kind of very they were slightly personality disordered but I don't know what they put they are exactly i'm not a doctor I can't diagnose them, but they were displaying kind of similar behaviors to. The were unhealthy and I said, you know hey I don't I don't think it's gonna work out i'm busy with work, you know let's just see where we are in a few years. And they were like cool whatever bro but you know, like. It was like okay that's. that's as bad as i'm cool with that, as long as they aren't angry at me that's great. um. But like it's so I mean i've and I, there are at least three people at my co workers in two of my bosses who are. Definitely. very, very similar they felt familiar because they're basically like my. So it's like I said very clear boundaries with them. And that's why don't need help setting. boundaries I just need help, like because I can you know, with people like at work or whatever i'm more talking about like if i'm like in a doctor's office or if i'm. Right like with my roommates and. Sometimes, like my roommates were both raised by you know relatively sane people you know so it's like sometimes they unintentionally do things that are like. kind of urge unhelpful. So it's just more like I need some I need more skills like to be able to play get out get out of a state, you know, besides like doing you know laundry for three hours."
148.0,Provider,working through the trauma.
16122.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah like you know and eventually get to the point where i'm maybe not being triggered so much."
148.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I hear you yeah."
16122.0,Patient,So I you.
148.0,Provider,"Know request to have you switched over to. Like I said a trauma specific therapists and. Is there anything else, I can do gel requested trauma specific group for you as well."
16122.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just the thing with the group would be to make sure that, like again like there isn't anybody need. This, I understand, like a lot of a lot of people with borderline personality disorder do have trauma, but I want to make sure that, like, I would just say like avoid group. For now, if at all possible, because it's like if i'm exposed to people with that particularly borderline because that's what my my mom and my grandmother in has. This it's again it's like I don't have anything against them, I just cannot be exposed to them, people like that right now."
148.0,Provider,Right right so you'd like to do more work and individual sessions right now and then be putting in group. Okay yeah.
16122.0,Patient,"I mean if he if he if there's if there's a group that's like you know survivors, and you know people like me, you know who are not personality disorder, but you know. do have the similar issues like that you know who don't have like the inner personal issues but have like the you know the. This association or being like Okay, what is that emotion, you know, but not because it's like they don't they don't know what it is, but because, like they were not allowed to express emotions ever, you know as a child."
148.0,Provider,Right.
16122.0,Patient,"Right, you know. That would be very helpful. yeah."
148.0,Provider,"So i'll go ahead and put in a request for these items.

And we'll get you will get you an appointment as soon as i'll put this as soon as possible okay okay."
16122.0,Patient,"yeah and like I said, like I have other for me to support like a church and things like that you know it's it's really just this really specific thing that right. In its so i'm not you know i'm not like in crisis or anything it's you know, so if it's like a month way or something that you know. It really the only thing like you know, like i'm fine with with dominic you know, like just staying on top of my meds and everything. Is isn't. is important feel so."
