724.0,Provider,I was gonna say that much time to see lot last I talked to you going on a hunting trip.
13379.0,Patient,"yeah that was September. yeah temper so it has been a while here yeah. i've been doing the group sessions for since I got head got back there. And I i'm not really finding the I guess the counselor part. Sure it's fine with that I don't know. You know, having somebody read to you out of a book on a zoom this is kind of. hard to."
724.0,Provider,hard to.
13379.0,Patient,"For attention, maybe yeah it just you know it's like I could read it myself obviously so. Okay, but anyways so i'm back here. Okay, and. what's happened in the interim here well like I said life ups and downs. My trip was was a great with by a couple of my best friends. Did sober trip and. Nice and i've lapsed back and forth since then and i'm still struggling with it here. Okay, so."
724.0,Provider,"I so well. we'll also scale back slit the trip was good, there was no. No drinking at all."
13379.0,Patient,"No, none of us."
724.0,Provider,So I that's awesome okay.
13379.0,Patient,"yeah yeah my friends, you know, like one friend he. has been sober for like six seven years now. And we've course used to drink on those trips. To access but. And then my other friend has kinda like me going back and forth with trying to not drink so much and, but it was a good, you know. Good trip. lot of miles."
724.0,Provider,On the spread out there.
13379.0,Patient,"This we usually do like a full two week trip, but we had to do this, one in like 10 days, because. My friend matt had another trip an offshore fishing trip to go. and"
724.0,Provider,Pretty busy.
13379.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and he just got back from Alaska. But now now he's paying for it he's just slam be. So, but yeah you know and it's like two plus days driving on each end of like you know 15 plus hours driving each day. Brutal it's pretty brutal. yeah three guys that works pretty good, because you know somebody to drive somebody to copilot. Somebody that rast snooze if they want. And and i've been doing this trip since like. Most years more than not since like 91. So. yeah and haven't gone as much the last you know, probably the last 10 years but. So it was nice to go to get across the border was all good even with coven they had you know some hoops to jump through. sure we weren't sure we were going to get it. You know, to do a. Do a test, you know within 72 hours of your arrival that's negative, so we took the test in fallon Nevada and just kept driving and it worked out, they were just south of the border spent the night and our phone start going off at six telling us our results so that worked out."
724.0,Provider,Perfect okay.
13379.0,Patient,And we didn't have to resort to play and beast.
724.0,Provider,Nevada.
13379.0,Patient,"Now Montana, my friend matt grew up there, and we would go do something in Montana."
724.0,Provider,So he said a backup plan is good for nothing to from what. We got here yeah.
13379.0,Patient,"yeah it's kind of early, it would have been like you know would grouse or something there are a lot of the other seasons work opened yet like they are in Canada, but yeah he had matt had plenty in mind for us if it didn't work out Montana wyoming. are already that far east so. anyways and yeah it was it was a good trip, it was not the not the best turning it was gonna I don't know if this is the new normal, but it was like 7580 degrees up there every day. And that doesn't make for good water falling he wants some stormy weather but yeah."
724.0,Provider,So down right.
13379.0,Patient,"yeah yeah just make some moves around me makes them, you know a little more urgent. Gert load up on the grain before they have to make their next job and. see that everything from you know, like like. The 10th of September, where the snow and Michael and you could almost lose your stuff out in the field. And then you know and then you'd have we'd have usually that that trip that ended that few days later, it was T shirt weather and back and forth, but it's it's just dry it's really sad to see driving all the way from here to there in drought in pretty terrible drought so."
724.0,Provider,yeah it has been a real bad drought up there.
13379.0,Patient,So and. katie Bowman was good for a while and started drinking some wine. And it's been you know back and forth again here quick quick for several days and but. The urges are clear there. Right so. Of course that causes tensions.
724.0,Provider,Are you are you back at the House or. No so with the.
13379.0,Patient,loops in that yeah so yep. And that adds a layer of stress.
724.0,Provider,"Pressure yeah for sure we talked about that, before you love."
13379.0,Patient,OK.
724.0,Provider,"um. So. it's been two months, how many. Of you felt like you've gotten back to drinking more in the last few months or. Less within the last two months. If that makes sense to restarted like. The back and forth, you have more ups and downs or."
13379.0,Patient,it's probably more ups than downs.
724.0,Provider,"Now I mean that would alcohol is understand this it's like. that's a hard one to kick 100% you know and early recovery you're going to have a lot of peaks and valleys because. it's not like other drugs, you know, are the things that we can become dependent on because the access to it is. Everywhere everywhere it's a lot of social interactions and a lot of people. You know I mean around the holidays like like they don't know that somebody might struggle with it and they might be oblivious to it but that's not going to. You know, without them, knowing like they're not going to stop doing what they do drinking wine or if they drink beers while watching for it's like socially widely accepted it's part of so many activities it's on TV it's part of sponsorships for. You know I mean it's just yeah one of those things it's always like in your face, and I can imagine, as somebody with a chemical dependency. or or an issue with abuse with that substance always being on Friday, it would be like a heroin addict constantly like turning on TV to watch their favorite football team and then every every five minutes or a commercial for heroin it's like. Okay i'm supposed to get through the whole season like. This maybe the first game it's cool you know i'm still early it's by a recovering I got the willpower and determination, all that kind of good stuff but like. As the season winds on you're like oh my God like just constantly reminding you constantly reminding you so it's one of those things that's very difficult in early recovery it's even more problematic so. Ultimately, what I want safety, you know, I hope that you'll be safe right to it's like understanding that. That this type of things going to happen right, so my expectation isn't for you to be like one day be like yep i'm there i'm done i'm never going to touch it again it's like that would be unreasonable, you know, for you, for me, for anybody else so. what's important is like what you're getting from the experience like are you learning from it, are you. Are you figure out what's more important in your life like what are your takeaways I know when you slip you're like shit you probably like I probably should have done that, and like. Maybe that put some more distance in between the time that you use again and then for that happens, you learn a little bit more, and then you're just setting up like healthy boundaries for yourself is anything like that happening."
13379.0,Patient,"yeah yeah what is pretty hard to trip. You know it's. not happy with myself when I do obviously and. You know, oh OK, for a couple of days and and it's calling my name again. And I spent a lot of time alone so."
724.0,Provider,"it's a recipe for for self destruction for sure. yeah um. I guess, are you having any physical withdrawal symptoms, would you stop."
13379.0,Patient,"No, I didn't have any you know we may for a couple of weeks there. nope not at all."
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so even even now, since you you've kind of see saw it a little bit still the travelers no no confusion, though blackouts seizures not okay."
13379.0,Patient,No nothing like that fortunately.
724.0,Provider,"Good very, very good Those are the things that are like the biggest concerns on the on the medical side of the House when it comes to this and the physical side."
13379.0,Patient,"Those are the things, those are the markers that we want to pay attention to."
724.0,Provider,"Right, so we have to focus on like a harm reduction kind of model with it, where it's like. We have to figure out how to. how you can start establishing some boundaries and then setting some some expectations, you know with those boundaries for yourself. You know, because if you don't have physical withdrawal seconds that's good right, so that we can kind of play around with how you're going to manage you know you know. The slips based on what's triggering it, how we can develop like a plan to deal with those those triggers and, as you said, like being at home alone. At night, you know that's a problem you know living with your you know your your wife sister that's a product, these are all triggers that you know as a pile up it's is it makes it easier for you to be like yet time and check out. yeah I have a drink. So we need to really kind of plan how we're going to do with those things, because if it's not helping, then you might need to find like a better living situation, but if that's causing you stress, then we might need to figure something out to address that."
13379.0,Patient,"yeah the thing that's more stressful is. You know, not being at home and in my interactions with my wife. And we even work together. But. yeah it's you know. I hate to say it, but it's the same dance. it's like. Her. hurts her part of the dance is fulfilled, too. So. And that's you know that doesn't help it's like just being stuck and. She doesn't think it's she's a part of it, so that makes it. Not you know heart, it makes it harder to untangle."
724.0,Provider,"um. That part you're not going to have too much control over because unless she's seeking out, you know. You know counseling or therapy or or input from somebody else and she's she's probably pretty content being where she's at you know. Because things means you know, like she she still has her home to go to."
13379.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"That makes sense, you know she she could pop into work and then take off like her comfort zone is still stable."
13379.0,Patient,mm hmm.
724.0,Provider,"So for you it's like Okay, I can see you. And it's at work and fly, because I can maintain my professionalism all that kind of stuff But then when I leave here it's like I can't go. home we're like where my comfort zone is like I don't have that luxury, I have to go to your sister's place. And that's stressful for you and it's stressful for sure the sister for the like the the dichotomy relationship that she in your your wife have so it's like that whole situation is bad news for everybody, but it's like, but you have nowhere to go. So it's not fair to you either. And you know, have you guys had a discussion about. Like the living arrangements like I know this is kind of supposed to be like a temporary thing but."
13379.0,Patient,yeah was.
724.0,Provider,And now it's.
13379.0,Patient,Like six months.
724.0,Provider,"Right so so I mean what's have you talked to her and be like Okay, we need to come up with like a like a real plan here now because six months is a long time to be you know crashing with your sister in law."
13379.0,Patient,"yeah it's she's actually well she's pretty chill hub. she's taken in other people when they needed it before times and. banshees a pretty just a pretty chill roommate really but but yeah it's like you know. All like you know, like i'm living out of a suitcase almost you acquired a closet. And so much of my. My things are you know at my house and. it's a big place my wife there's a lot she can't do to take care of it, so I you know. it's my house to that so you know I find myself going up there and fixing things doing things."
724.0,Provider,And not. and not necessarily betting from it.
13379.0,Patient,You know yeah well yeah you know it's it's not my house anymore it's. Not not technically but. and
724.0,Provider,feel like that right.
13379.0,Patient,"Now it's like it's like you know told I can't be there obviously and. Not. It yeah it can be it gets. I mean I can't help, but have some resentment at times. And, of course, that that. Get sensor off. You know she has this real thing of not being appreciated enough just it's. You know something I think, since she was a kid or dad was not. Was was not there for might be to put it. And so you know it's just really easy for, though, for you know those things to for to trigger her. And you know you don't appreciate that you do you didn't don't thank me enough didn't do this for me kind of stuff. which adds you know. Express frustration on my part, at times, I try and you know just. Okay, this is, you know, but even even saying you know. We do we do you have to go there, do you have to. throw everything back out every time you know it's like it doesn't take much and there there we are again and but that's yeah we you know. that's more of a marriage counselor for real."
724.0,Provider,yeah have you guys considered. Doing that or she open to the.
13379.0,Patient,idea we. We did. You know and. Some of it help maybe you know. And I think she feels that you know that this is what I need to to resolve and. Then we can talk about that you know that so.
724.0,Provider,"would respectfully probably disagree with it. I think in in combination. Both avenues are acceptable, you know what I mean because it's not you know what I mean it's not all this out, I mean it's not just you drinking that's not. that's not the only problem right most part it's new it's controlled and would be in more control, if you were like in a different setting if you didn't have all these other roadblocks you know, like like it would be even a it'd be in a better place. You can't get. Those roadblocks because of the situation. And you'll never going to be like it to therapy, you know with her if you can't get past these so it's already like like designed to failure, you know what I mean it's like a like a snake eating its own tail. same thing and it's like well. I think if you guys, you know attempting to do therapy, you can hash out some of that stuff and then potentially get to a place where you could move back into your House back into your comfort zone. And then you might be able to have a little bit more control of your situation in your processing right so. That would probably be a conversation might want to bring up with her, and I mean like it's just not one thing it's a combination of a lot of things that if you can work on all those things a little bit at a time, it might start cleaning up. makes sense."
13379.0,Patient,It does yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But you're also gonna have like a backup plan to like if she's not willing to you know set up like a. Like a timeline for you, then you don't know what you're working on it's been like you said just about six months and it's like. You know how much longer, am I supposed to do this for six more months like what do I have to prove to you that i'll do all right, like like not drink for six months is that the deal like."
13379.0,Patient,that's that's what just throw out.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it was three months, not enough you want six months it's like. yeah at that point relationship is suffering, you know this animosity and resentment not both sides and it's like I don't know what what y'all can expect the the be a positive outcome if you don't start addressing it now these time is only going to make those resentments like worse. I think if you guys got together and kind of clear the air out and it's set up like. Like some goals of mutual goals with each other than you would want know what you're working on working towards then she would know what she's working on and and working towards that you guys go to like a reasonable conclusion."
13379.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Well, so frustrated."
13379.0,Patient,And she'll throw out things like you know you got to appreciate me more. and
724.0,Provider,"How would she would like you to show that, though, because guys guys have a hard time showing appreciation, despite appreciating what like the like our significant others and stuff like that it's like, how do you how would you like us to do that. There, because we're more like a lot, like the silent type it's like you want to prove that I would step in front of a trade for you. Like like. What you want me to do like you want me to buy more flowers you want more materialistic stuff where you have to say I appreciate you it's like because I do you know I just don't know how to convey that to it's such a way that you will understand where i'm coming from it's like oh."
13379.0,Patient,yeah it's like.
724.0,Provider,"Like I come over your House. Or, according to our House on a repair stuff you know what I mean like like I say you say that I don't appreciate, you know I don't value you if that was the case i'm like nope sucks to be you know cold like no hot water for the for the winter do. You know what I mean it's like yeah like i'll do whatever you want to do it's like."
13379.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,Because I appreciate you for calling my life.
13379.0,Patient,"she'll say something like you know I want I want you to compliment the five times, every time you see me. Which is just clear all kinda like. can try it seems like to me. And you know I i'm trying to give her some of that but it's also you know it's kind of it feels like. Forced i'm pouring water into a well. it's not going to fill up it's. So it's. yeah it's. It you know it feels to be like okay if it's forced and it's just. throwing up hurdles and you know. That I can't really get past year."
724.0,Provider,"Right, so I don't know I mean you love her right."
13379.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Clearly, you do I mean she's the mother your kids and there's all that kind of stuff to it but. Could you. Could you finish out the rest of your existence without her being your wife like you love her enough to continue to jump through all these hurdles. To appease her you know what I mean and do all these things, and if you're not getting it what we call like reciprocity where she's going to. match that which even big hey you know Mitch, I appreciate, you too, I see how hard you're working out of that you keep crazy hours and you're an excellent dad and your you know I know that you're struggling with. You know this alcohol bag and you know I see that you're trying and I appreciate it, you get any kind of words of encouragement on your end or. No negativity."
13379.0,Patient,No it's like pointing out failures.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's you know what I mean like it's not it's not inspiring you to."
13379.0,Patient,Know it's not. yeah.
724.0,Provider,So.
13379.0,Patient,"hard to be you know. be good about. You know, like feels like. rubbing the baby's nose in the dirty diapers."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's like if you're gonna if you're going to me or talk down to you, every time I tripped and stumbled that it's like. what's the point you're going to keep me stuck you know they call it like a power and control model, you know and like. You know, we talked about like abusive relationships it doesn't just have to be physical abuse emotional abuse, and you know mental abuse and stuff like that, but there's like I like the power control bottle and I thought, like a family therapist. i'll probably butchering this but, like essentially like the bro science behind it it's like. Two people will be one of them is obviously way down and have super vulnerable state, and this person comes in, they prey on that state right, so they. pick a mob and they're like hey yeah you know that, like. I could take care of you you're better than this, you know they they encourage them and support them and also this person's like. Their self worth improves or self esteem improves of like hell yeah I have a good person and they start getting to a certain point so here's the here's the control person is a broken person. they're going to work on Oregon workout you have all the way up here as soon as they get up here they knock out the legs dropped, because they don't want to surpass the control. Right, you know, one of them come above the control all so they don't need this person at work is like that they figure out like okay now. i'm in a good place this this person loses the controller so they'll say something like negative shit like oh yeah but you're still an alcoholic Pooh. Did I mean everything that you strive for, they just knock it down to just take you like, like a peg down. And that's like the power control ball I think that's a side so essentially it's like what's the point of working super hard to do with all this extra stuff that better yourself. If the person you're doing it for essentially is not recognizing that it is keeping down so you can love it person, but you cannot you can also not be in love with them if that makes sense."
13379.0,Patient,mm hmm.
724.0,Provider,"And if you're not feeling that then it's like maybe we need to pivot and go a different route and become somewhat more selfish. And just focus on you and then getting you to a point, your life to where you're like i'm good I can sustain on my own, and I don't need. I don't need you to be like my trigger I don't need to come home every day after I bust my ass at work for you to tell me how much of a dirtbag I am. Chris for sure i'm just going to go off on my own and get loaded you know what I mean like I don't need to put up with this bullshit every time I come home. If that's where that relationship is headed like headed or has headed like that you need to reevaluate that relationship and maybe it's maybe it's not what you're working for that maybe it's too toxic for repair. So i'm sure it's probably cross your mind how to imagine right like. Oh yeah Okay, so if. So if that's their then did you have to maybe explore that a little bit you know what it suck yeah are you kids growing up and out of the House yeah you know, do you have like a history and that houses sentimental yep but it's still just a house. Right, I mean if it's you know if it's not what it used to be. You know that it's going to turn into this thing where like when you show up you're like this doesn't feel like home anymore, and even if it got. Even a little bit better and you move back in you still might be living in like like like like the feeling of it doesn't really feel like my own anymore like I don't feel like I belong here. You know, then there's a point in my life, where i've been gone for six months, nine months a year it's like and then you come back and it's like yeah i'd be like I feel like I rent this place doesn't feel like I built it, you know what I mean so. That might be something to consider if you like, and you know you'd have to set up some expectations for yourself like How much longer are you going to tolerate not being able to go home. Because one of the because the other person of the House doesn't want you there like. Like In fairness, like what does that stop."
13379.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,well.
13379.0,Patient,it's a lot to untangle.
724.0,Provider,"For sure yeah and it's a mess, you know I mean like like i'm you know and full self disclosure like i'm divorced and. It obviously wasn't married nearly as long as you have so I can only imagine, but even like at 10 years just. Because untangling the web of those relationships I kind of stuff it's a disaster, you know what I mean like. yeah like things are super hard you have you have a lot of usually owned stuff and that it's about separate is it's a mess bro like so. I understand, like the the resistance and the you know. The idea of just being like okay I I can be content and deal with it like I can manage it, because everything else is so complicated, and it would be really tough but. You know I don't know if that would be the best option for you."
13379.0,Patient,"well. At this point, not, but I can see getting there. If it's this can't go on and definitely."
724.0,Provider,"Right so yeah I mean you, when you have to set like a goal in your head right because right now you're you know, the only goal that that you have, as far as I know, when it comes to like the alcohol thing is is just just not drink right like."
13379.0,Patient,mm hmm.
724.0,Provider,"That can't, be it, you know I mean because. You could do very well for a while, like you had and then slip and then regress and then it's like well now what am I working on that to get back to like get back to not drinking again when I was already there it's like you could lose a lot of steam, and a lot of momentum. know what that way, whereas if you change the goal, obviously the long term goal is is to be you know alcohol free right. But the other goal could be like. I cannot allow myself to drink as much as I have been doing, you know I mean we could use what they call it the harm reduction model and it's like. Just decrease your use and opposed to just the idea of being like that's it 100% like I can't do any bar late those extremes and those those pendulums like shifts they never work. And you can't be like either drink or I don't drink like life isn't black and white, like that there's some Gray area that we have to navigate in so it's like. I can't drink like I used to, but since I like I have a hard time because I don't have like like the coping strategies to ward off. I need to at least develop like a pattern be like maybe I only have one glass of wine or two glasses why don't Polish the bottle off, I have a little bit of this like discipline here then over time. You could work to that long term goal, where you're like I don't drink at all anymore not like I used to know it so it's. We have to set like reasonable expectations right, so if the wife is thinking like Oh, you need to be on 2% abstinence free before you can cut back in a House it's like well that's probably not that's probably not reasonable. Right."
13379.0,Patient,Well that's what i'm being handed so.
724.0,Provider,"That ultimatum is not that never helped anybody in recovery or anything like that it's like well if that's the case you know what I mean like, then I bought his will. Look, for my own place because it's going to be a wild so I get to the point where I never have a drink again like it's pretty extreme like that expectation is pretty extreme right you, you have a full time job you're successful your kids are healthy they're good. You you are somebody in your employment you pay your bills you got no legal history that i'm that i'm aware of right now to Why is you have lost your job you."
13379.0,Patient,know.
724.0,Provider,"you're not in debt or bank, you know I mean like you have like like all these things, these environmental factors that are very stable. You know, and if, and if they weren't you know that would be problematic and you could be like yeah it's because i'll because I drink all the time. I got fired from a job and I got arrested for dui like all this punch you don't have any of that so I can't say that that that you know that that you're drinking is a huge detriment to your overall life because you you've managed up to this point, it seems like the relationship. Is is in a place to where that's The one thing that she could latch on to you and I don't know, maybe you are terrorists when you're drunk I don't know what I mean so it's like. But like on the surface, when we look at like factors were you know is is your drinking affecting your day to day life is that affected your ability to perform basic tasks and it's like. On the surface that's not that's not the case, so it seems like like there's there's there's conflict at home because of the drinking and maybe you know, maybe you are difficult or whatever it is, but. We need to figure out why that is like what's going on back at all to where when you do drink xyz happens, and when you don't drink you still getting X, Y Z if that makes sense."
13379.0,Patient,yeah that's how it feels at times.
724.0,Provider,Certain right so when you do and drag like like how much do you drink.
13379.0,Patient,"Oh, my bottle of wine and if there's more around them. You know it's kinda like face start it's. a bottle of wine it's pretty easy to."
724.0,Provider,kind of.
13379.0,Patient,Polish off.
724.0,Provider,And she drank too or no.
13379.0,Patient,She does that much.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have for you it's like regulation like like once you go you go."
13379.0,Patient,it's that's the hard part yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and what's your endpoint what's your endpoint look like."
13379.0,Patient,"um you know, like to drink a bottle of wine and there was more it's like maybe you know, not a lot more I stop. So you get like."
724.0,Provider,"You get drunk you get red face you get blackout, do you get to the point to where you're like you're you know you're falling down and, like you, don't recall anything like what's."
13379.0,Patient,"No, not well my wife would say that. You know the. I guess for for my I see that, like kind of my resentment comes up more i've been drinking, or at least a filter goes away. that's."
724.0,Provider,"What i'm looking for like like that, like the the patterns of behavior once you. Once you get to that point a bottle and a half right like does it become self destructive or you abusive verbally abusive physically like. You get to a point to where like if you were sobering that somebody in that current mind say, would you like that individual or we just be like this person is just to watch."
13379.0,Patient,yeah well. I don't get. Physical. loud. Any of that but I I do know my resentments you know again my filter for for those other things. This. is definitely weekend. yeah. not going there.
724.0,Provider,"Tonight well that that's you know that's that's the effect of alcohol and the central executive functioning and. inhibition and all that kind of stuff it kind of clears that up and and people a little bit more like truth serum people before a lot with their thought process, there is no filter. yeah I mean essentially trying to see what is. What is destructive as far as that relationship goes that's due to your alcohol consumption, do you drink every night, or is this a couple times a week or only other weekends, are you."
13379.0,Patient,"There was a long time, where was you know almost every day, not not every day but pretty damn regular."
724.0,Provider,"So, like seven days out of the week, like five. yeah. and obviously that's on work nights to any hangovers the following day, like that it was it impacted your ability to go to work."
13379.0,Patient,"not really no. No, you have no physical withdrawal symptoms when you'd like the next morning or anything like that. No."
724.0,Provider,Other than like like a hangover headaches dehydration stuff like that.
13379.0,Patient,"yeah dehydration you know I mean I stayed away from hard alcohol for a long time because that's. yeah you know it's a lot easier to get too far too fast and. So. Maybe that's part of why I just drink wine, I mean, of course, I like to with food to."
724.0,Provider,As a cultural Part I.
13379.0,Patient,Like to cook. yeah but. So you know. Like. I find myself stopping before I really get.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have some regulation."
13379.0,Patient,"yeah now I recognize that here, maybe, no."
724.0,Provider,"All right, well Okay, so when was the last time he drank."
13379.0,Patient,Saturday.
724.0,Provider,"So it's been a couple days, do you have any access to wine currently."
13379.0,Patient,"Well, I could always go get some I don't have any."
724.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and on Saturday, how much did you drink."
13379.0,Patient,I drink a bottle yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and then what happened."
13379.0,Patient,"And then I stopped at dinner and. went to bed, because I was gonna get up real early on Sunday, and you know, there was kind of what it. What it was. Okay."
724.0,Provider,"All right, so look. What I what I think we should do. I think the goal should be like in the next 30 days are. Not that I would I get I wish I did, because my job is like that, like an alcohol drug counselors that is not advocate use right but i'm not. stupid either, so I want to stick with like like a harm reduction concept. And I what I would like to see you do avoided if you can absolutely do not drink like like i'm not telling you to drink, but if you do drink. Set up so some boundaries with that bottle maybe not drink the whole bottle you know what I mean it's just. Can we practice that like if you do find yourself in a situation where you're like it's this is happening like it's going to happen, and you know we've already committed to our past. You know, like like the struggle part that if it's going to happen and least regulate yourself. To one glass one or two whatever it is, but the goal is is to not finish the bottle. Can we do that, like the next 30 days."
13379.0,Patient,yeah right.
724.0,Provider,that's that's the plan are you on any medications or anything like that carly.
13379.0,Patient,"I take a blood pressure. Good and. I have, I do have no tricks on. I have taken it. I should probably go see my doctor here next week haven't seen him in a long time, so to get that renewed. It seemed to help I wouldn't say it's you know hundred percent. and yeah and that's that's it really."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so that's the plan Okay, and I know that you've already made up a follow up appointment with me."
13379.0,Patient,In a couple of weeks in.
724.0,Provider,"The summer, which is good. yeah so that's what I want you to do I want you to start setting up some boundaries for yourself as far as your drinking is concerned, if you feel like it's going to happen, then we need to at least compromise right. A little bit on your approach to it, so that would be one goal. Another goal i'd like you to consider is maybe having a conversation with. With your wife and figure out really hard and fast what her expectations are as far as your relationship goes past the idea of you just not drinking any alcohol anymore be like let's be realistic okay. be like is this relationship going to persevere and move past all this when we get back to whatever your your gold standard be is, or do we need to really start acting like adult and figuring out what we do next. Whether or not that's therapy, whether or not that. I don't know I don't want to say divorce, you know what I mean like like take the steps towards avoiding that at all possible."
13379.0,Patient,that's one option but it's definitely right so. don't want to go there first. But right.
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's not your what we call like like you're just see records is like. yeah go. But be like look up feeling obviously you know I still care about you deeply i'd like for this to work, so I think we should maybe it goes to some therapy consider. You know, you know family therapy and see what happens right so maybe have that conversation with her, you know this month, maybe after the new year, you want to be in the euro resolutions are always good people. They like those things so. be like okay after the holidays, we should really considered about maybe going into therapy, you know for our relationship and then see where it goes from there okay."
13379.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"All right, so those are a couple things that i'd like you to work on, so a little harm reduction. Have a conversation with the wife about what her real expectations are minus the alcohol like we're just not willing to pass all that, be like what do you like, what do you want out of the relationship long term. It and that'll give you kind of like a game plan on how to pursue it, you know give you something to work towards all right um. I think you have to do your surveys, it looks like he might be behind on."
13379.0,Patient,Surveys okay.
724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah you're definitely service so and I think you're behind on your labs to so, what was the last time you ate."
13379.0,Patient,"You know well, I did one lab one your toes both blood tests on that there was also not unknown to me, but when I went into the lab a urine test. What you know it was explained it's like. If i'm being prescribed something you know they need to know. yeah and it's not you know don't have anything."
724.0,Provider,So.
13379.0,Patient,"It I mean, I guess, I."
724.0,Provider,Are you getting Gavin patent from us is.
13379.0,Patient,I did get a prescription but i've not taken India of it so i'm not. gonna bet.
724.0,Provider,"that's probably what it is, though."
13379.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,So found file if you're a prescribed anything from us then yeah they require talk screens.
13379.0,Patient,yeah well i'll take the yeah I mean it's a cost per treatment for something i'm not using so.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it'll show up is nothing so. um. And then i'll like i'll just your your talk screen after that, so what I would do is I would call the virtual clinic right. And that's everybody's favorite thing to hear, but you gotta call the virtual clinic and have them send the email to you with all the start with the link to the surveys. Okay, and then tell them that you have to get a order in for the labs you have to physically go to like the local quest lab or whatever it is, wherever you went did like your blood work initially for lab."
13379.0,Patient,"Oh yeah they sent me a you know for the urine test the thing for in the mail and. So you know, I guess, they could do that and send it back."
724.0,Provider,"Well yeah I mean the same have a long sessions. yeah I think they want you to go to the local lab. Like after after like 60 days are required to get a little. Like local lab. Okay, so I would. yeah call the virtual clinic tell them to send you the link with this with their surveys and so when you logged in today with the virtual clinic that they tell you anything about the surveys or no. No okay yeah so. call them on get the link for the service and then tell them to put an order so you can go to a lab do a urinalysis."
13379.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"i'll tell you, whichever one is local and then you'll go on through that all right."
13379.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
724.0,Provider,"As far as the group, the Group thing goes, I can see if there was like another group that would be better fitting for you, that I believe. Sharon is she your therapist or the counselor or the doctor right Sharon is."
13379.0,Patient,The doctor yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, I can see what other group Sharon has that maybe she can place you in one."
13379.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"All right, so."
13379.0,Patient,"I mean it's it's helpful what it's kind of like you know. My story bro. So yeah you know I mean it's it's probably good to see people in various points in the spectrum and. totally different substances, a lot of it. But the kind of issues are similar. But yeah it's. I guess it's useful as well it's really one that that you know count the counselor came in and to it that's that's kind of like that just seems like a total waste of. To me like I said, you know reading a book Kevin people read out of it on zoom meetings is not real effective."
724.0,Provider,yeah you're not connecting with it so go. So.
13379.0,Patient,anyways.
724.0,Provider,"All right, yeah that's that's what i'll see if I can work on that for you too."
13379.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so well, it was good, seeing yeah yeah yeah like like literally on Friday I was that Jesus I haven't seen mentioned a hot minute. And I check and I was, like all right Lisa I was like at least the hunting trip was good, because he came back you know. So I was like. So I sent like a request for you to like to for them to contact the make the appointments for me so i'm glad that you did. Alright, so game plan is you're gonna do some harm reduction, a little governor on your wine consumption if it gets to that point obviously absence is always the best what we're not you know we're not kids we're not foolish in our expectations. So some moderation right and then we'll work on that. Have a conversation, and you have to pick like the opportunity to have that conversation with her. To see what her expectations are that you'd be willing to go to therapy and I kind of stuff are."
13379.0,Patient,You okay.
724.0,Provider,And then call the virtual clinic get the surveys and your lab stuff squared away and then you and I meet again I think in two weeks.
13379.0,Patient,Two weeks here yeah.
724.0,Provider,And then i'm going to work on see if we can find a better fit for a better group for you and we'll see what Sharon Scott alright.
13379.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,Alright well it's good CDs for sure.
13379.0,Patient,"Okay, Joe will. See you in a couple weeks."
724.0,Provider,"You could, if you need anything before that just. contact the virtual clinic if you need to talk to me and then they'll just plug you in where i'm available all right."
13379.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good. Okay, thank you."
724.0,Provider,"Alright, for transcription have a session with Michel pharaoh he's gonna contact a virtual clinic. To have his. survey link sent to them is easy to catch up on a surveys he's going to request a lab order to so you can go to your analysis i'll probably adjust his monthly requirement for uds to not applicable if he's not taking any medication from us and he's just here for alcohol. The other thing is for some short term goals that we've identified that we're going to work on is some harm reduction, with his drinking and potentially. Bad your family counseling, for he and his wife establish boundaries and expectations, other than that he has a schedule schedule appointment with me in two weeks, and then we'll see where is that we meet nothing else like you."
