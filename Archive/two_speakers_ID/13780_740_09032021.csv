13780.0,Patient,She just started.
740.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know I don't know what's normal I just started literally last Monday. Okay, oh I guess we'll figure out what normal is together."
13780.0,Patient,"All right, there you go."
740.0,Provider,um how have you been how's everything been more.
13780.0,Patient,"um it's been going Okay, a little bit well actually have good days and bad days, a lot of mine is stress from my marriage. I think I think i'm with like, I know, with the controlling person, but I think he's a little bit narcissistic and i'm just learning how to. are trying to learn how to set my boundaries and kind of stick up for myself without rocking the boat I guess per se."
740.0,Provider,What do you mean when you say rocking the boat.
13780.0,Patient,"Because anything that doesn't go in his favor is an argument. he's one of those people that thinks he's always right, he you know I can't really have an opinion, because if I do have an opinion i'm wrong and then it's just a bigger argument than. It needed to be so i've decided to work on me and fix what I know I can fix and. We can't whoa we were supposed to start individual counseling and marital counseling counseling and quit drinking well i've put drinking and started my counseling. But that's as far as it's gone and so now he's just like you're the one with the problem you go fix you and your kids my children my grandchildren he doesn't want me to really. I shouldn't say he doesn't care if I have a relationship with them, he just doesn't want them to call me and need anything from me, or even. I don't know it's hard to explain he's very he just has different parenting skills and I do."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13780.0,Patient,"And I tried to understand that, but he doesn't understand that I grew up with my children, I was young, when I had my children. Yes, they're grown but we're very close, I was a single parent, most of the time, and he just wants them he's like their ground, they should just be out on their own, they shouldn't ask you for advice anything, or even just how to make dinner, I mean that that's a fight. Just dislike. anything like my son oh you'll be like oh mom I got to like you know I did one up on you, I you know made this plate, but it tastes, a bit like you know he'll just be harassing me just like you know tease me. And my husband gets really upset and i'm like it's Okay, if he calls me to tell me that. He made dinner and he's proud of himself. So i'm learning as i'm just trying to set my boundaries and figure this out, I have a lot there's a lot of history, a lot of anxiety, a lot of. physical, mental abuse. And i'm just learning i'm just trying to like I said figure it out and set my boundaries and know that I could fix me and nobody else. Before I have a nervous breakdown."
740.0,Provider,How long have you ever been there.
13780.0,Patient,"Like two and a half years, but we were together for like I think like eight or nine years I can't remember exactly, and then we split up for the same reasons. And then, of course. I let him weasel after two years, I let him weasel his way back in because I was like okay i'm good enough, I can handle this now, and so we became friends again and then one thing led to another. And then he I thought he really had changed, and then we got married and now we're back to square one again."
740.0,Provider,"Can you say every man, you said two and a half years."
13780.0,Patient,yeah about two and a half years.
740.0,Provider,How long have you known.
13780.0,Patient,"i've known him. Oh, my gosh. Maybe 20 years but I didn't really associate with him I didn't like him, I didn't I just heard, he was bad news, so I just stayed away from him."
740.0,Provider,So what made you go through them.
13780.0,Patient,"Well, because once I started once what well we became friends like our kids my oldest son started hanging out with one is stepchildren at the time and we became I was like oh he's not as bad as I thought he was. You know, I was just like I was just listening to what other people said he's a he's a charmer he's a charmer and. worked his way in and yeah. My I should have went with my first gut instinct like they say. But I didn't and now i'm doing I like i'm I waited and I don't know it's just rough it's I want my marriage to work, but I also want to set boundaries with him. and be like it's okay for me to love my kids. And it's okay for me to be a caring person and it's okay for me to have these traits that I have and it's Okay, for you to have your trade. But to come on common ground, he doesn't. He doesn't do that, so I, I know I can't fix them or change them so i'm just trying to learn how to make me a better me. To deal with it."
740.0,Provider,How long has he been in his addiction.
13780.0,Patient,Do it.
740.0,Provider,How long has he been in his he.
13780.0,Patient,Oh drinking I think he's drink forever for a long time.
740.0,Provider,hmm.
13780.0,Patient,"But like I yeah I don't know I mean I like to drink too don't get me wrong, but if you're saying it's an issue and we need to quit drinking and then okay let's give it a try. But I didn't feel like he's not trying, and you know it's like an even like like his his thing is like well it's just a couple beers i'm having well it's just a couple yeah but you're doing it every day like you said you were going to stop. And you're not even slowing down the process. Or maybe because he's not drinking as much so, then I should take it as slowing down the process."
740.0,Provider,"Listen i'm just trying to figure out how. You can be safe, basically."
13780.0,Patient,"Oh, why I have keys to my car I can leave if I need to I know how I know how to call 911 I know how to do all that. But i'm really i'm really trying to fix my marriage, but I don't I i'm just stuck without being. Anxious like like I I don't do you have Facebook at all."
740.0,Provider,I do not anymore.
13780.0,Patient,"Okay, so. Okay, so you know, on Facebook when it says, like the little name things where you put in your name and it gives you like these."
740.0,Provider,characteristics mm hmm.
13780.0,Patient,"Okay it's a dumb little APP like you know, whatever so like yesterday I put I put one in, and it was a song like a song and then, but then it gave you like certain traits. And Lo and behold, you came into the room and just like literally went off on me. About you just want attention you want people to say something that set me up and i'm like no, it was just like. And, but I think he thinks that I put in all that stuff because he doesn't really understand Facebook, a whole lot, but I was explaining to him. know you like, I was like try it for yourself, I said just put your name in there and it'll pop up you know, but it was like literally a 30 minute argument and i'm like. you're arguing i'll delete it it's not even that big of a deal like you know I mean he's going on there, like laughing at me saying wow I can't you know. He goes you're just putting our business out there and i'm like no it's not even like that, like you're drinking way too much into it. But then I kind of feel like in the same sense if I want to post, something I should be able to post something. You know where it's like but it wasn't that big of a deal to me, so I just took it down to save the drama but it's just little things like that, where i'm like you're just and he's just like people think this and i'm like. it's not about you it's something that I posted it has nothing so nothing about you in that post. And i'm like not everything's about you i'm like bro like stop. Like it's not even that serious but it's like every everything air everything and sometimes I just feel like i'm not even entitled to my own opinion. And it gets frustrating and stressful."
740.0,Provider,yeah I can't I can't imagine how I was gonna ask you how does the boundaries work do they work I.
13780.0,Patient,"Know like that's something. that's something that i've struggled with my whole life i've struggled with the boundaries, so now i'm just trying to like re initiate them and, just like. You know, and so i'm still learning, you know i'm trying to teach myself on tinder if you feel strongly about, because I used to like no one could tell me anything, nobody could tell me anything, because I was. Strong headed strong willed but now i've been submissive and I want that power back like now you're changing my character and I don't want I don't want that. And I feel that and i'm gonna get my character back i'm gonna get me back."
740.0,Provider,So what's your plan how was your final doing.
13780.0,Patient,that's what i'm hoping my therapist can help me with that.
740.0,Provider,You know.
13780.0,Patient,"Yes. yeah yeah. yeah i'm just like you know I don't you know and he's just like you're not even working on us i'm like no I am that's why i'm going to counseling that's why I quit drinking, you know it's like I mean I drink I drink a couple times in the last month, but nothing crazy like I was doing. But. I wanted to like be still be a social drinker but not it be in everyday life activity."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Is a boundary discussion question. Yes, says. Personal boundaries all the rules and limits, you say within relationships, they tell you what's okay and what's not okay in a relationship, think about two people in your life and and describe the boundaries, you have with each one, how are they similar and how are they different. So your husband to be one and then. pick another one."
13780.0,Patient,I could pick my mom. Okay okay.
740.0,Provider,"So. What boundaries, do you have with your mom it versus your husband."
13780.0,Patient,"My husband yells at me and screams at me. And I will I used to react now I try not to react I just say you know what I tried to talk him through it. And I say you know I know you're upset I know you feel a certain way. But we will have to agree to disagree, because you have a different view than I have and. we're not going to see eye to eye on it, so why sit here and why, why is it Okay, for you to point in my face and yell at me and i'm not even yelling at you so i've tried to do it in a calm matter, instead of reacting. Like normally I would just fly off the handle. To are not always but sometimes I would you know, I would just be like, why are you always yeah you know, and it would just be more chaotic after that. And with my mom my mom I could tell my mom how I feel about something, and if we if we disagree, like he doesn't agree like if he doesn't agree with anything it's just his way or no way and I tell him that, as like if someone. disrupts your boat or your ride or whatever, I think you get so mad and start yelling and like like I tell him he's abusive I like your abusive you're verbally abusive to people when. They don't agree with you, I said it's okay for people to have a different opinion with my mom I could talk to my mom and if we don't see eye to eye on something. Or if it's something that's a little bit more nitty gritty where i'm like mom I don't want you to respond. I just want you to listen, I don't need you to try to help me, I just want you to listen to it and I don't want you to be judgmental and she will she's like Okay, you know, and she listened she's a good listener like he's not a good listener."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. So we got one one of your listener ones. Number two values are the things that are most important to you, ideally, your boundaries will reflect your values, for example, if you value family time you might say, strict boundaries, they work, what are your most important values and how do you have boundaries reflect these values."
13780.0,Patient,"yeah my my I have a strong family family ties with my kids and my mom my father and my. and also my husband, but my husband is against my whole family. So he doesn't want because and some of them are valid points he has with my children because they are adults and sometimes they make bad decisions, but like I tried to explain to him. it's not i've done my job, raising them but i'm still here to support them and not be like he could. He he's very he's he puts people down a lot he talks about about people and even if they're in a rough spot and I tell him, like our my. My thing is, I try to uplift people instead of putting them down because I don't think why, why do. I why beat the dead horse it's already down in the dirt they know they're not doing right, so you know, we need to support them and we need to try to help them out of their whole instead of digging deeper for them where he's like. You know, like he he'll throw away the key and not even look back, he does that personal relationship doesn't matter to him and it doesn't matter with him with a whole lot of people. Like you know he'll write somebody off in a heartbeat where i'm not that way i'm more like let's help them let's try to fix them let's try to see what we could do I mean not say like give them money or anything like that, but just like you know, like be supported."
740.0,Provider,"Number three, in your opinion, what are the sign of a healthy relationship. What sort of boundaries might, you see, in a healthy relationship So what are the signs of a healthy relationship and what put a boundary my to see."
13780.0,Patient,"um I think a healthy relationship is listening and understanding one another, even if you agree to disagree, because everyone has different opinions and I understand that completely. I don't think i'm in a healthy relationship, right now, because of that. Like I tell my my husband, I was like you're a great provider you're not a loving husband. And i'm working on setting the boundaries, because obviously i've allowed too much also. So i'm trying to set boundaries. Like like I was gonna say, for instance, one thing is. He got mad because he doesn't get along with my children so. My son, it was his 30th birthday, so I met him at the beach with my mom and we hung out for the day. And he got still got mad at me I you know it was like and i'm like, but I still want to spend time with my family just because you don't want to spend time with them that's not my problem and i'm working on setting that boundary because I want to spend time with my family still. And you're not going to tell me I can't see my family, because you don't like them."
740.0,Provider,"whoa. let's kind of imagine if we were to. Imagine a healthy marriage I hate the relation between you and your husband, what does that look like."
13780.0,Patient,"i'm happiness and getting along with each other, not arguing every single day of our lives and trying to. Provide and take care of each other and build together."
740.0,Provider,"And how likely. How likely be how likely, do you see that happening."
13780.0,Patient,"Well, right now, it's not going to and. that's why i'm trying to fix my part of it, so I know that i've tried and I. i'm trying to do everything that I can in my power to make this work, but in the long run, I like. I know, like you know i've talked to my primary care doctor also about the narcissism narcissistic part of it and. I know I can't change him, and so I I, I can only tell him how I feel and hope that he understands and makes a change, you know, and if not, I know what I have to do at the end of the day, because I can't live like this for the rest of my life. And you know there's been times when he's been physically abusive to me and. he'll like so like you'll be like Oh well, you were drunk you don't remember what happened, no, I remember it was traumatic and I tell him like what happened and he's like no that's not what but so he changes the story, but I know what happened, yes, I was intoxicated but I remember like. When when things happen to you that are traumatic like I tried to explain to him. And you know you remember, like it happens, and you remember it and. he's just like Oh well, all of a sudden, you just remember, I was like no I remembered, but I was embarrassed to saying anything you know now i'm not embarrassed i'm going to talk about it and i'm going to know that that it wasn't my fault that you did what you did. And he doesn't like that."
740.0,Provider,"hmm. Would the number for. Those people who are influential in your life as models for boundary setting whether their boundaries are healthy or unhealthy think of someone who has helped shape who you are what has this person taught you about boundaries, whether intentionally or unintentionally. that's a good question."
13780.0,Patient,"yeah that's really that's done from. huh I don't really I don't really know. I mean my mom and my step dad are very good role models they're very. they've had unhealthy parts in their relationship also but they've been able to work through it. But as far most part of. For the most part. My step dad is very passive so they get along really well. So. yeah he's very yeah yeah. So see my my husband will try to manipulate my step dad because he'll listen like he's very, very, very passive like he's a great listener great I told him I can't you be more like my like my step dad. Because he's like you just want to boss me around to my mom kind of does boss them around but it's not that it's just they get along really well they balance each other very well."
740.0,Provider,"Oh. Well there's only seven let's keep going. When someone has rigid boundaries, there were looking to ask others for hill protective of personal information and avoid enough close relationship. What do you think are the pros and cons of rigid boundaries describe an area in your life, where you've had rigid boundaries, so it seems like and when it when it when it breaks down this kind of definition. they're saying like these attributes bitchery parents and within your marriage and but from his bad. Religion to ask for help protect your personal information and avoid and have close relationships I he would you shoot her."
13780.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"So what do you think are the pros and cons of having rigid boundaries and then describe an area in your life when you say, would you."
13780.0,Patient,"um. I think the pros and cons is or the the. The bad part is. Like he just cut right everybody off and just not look back where me if I look at it more as a situation happen let's get past it and let's move forward. let's try to not let it happen again, but i'm on me with my boundaries because i'm forgiving I forgive quickly and I move on, so I guess that would be bad for me, also because it's kind of like. My like you know, like say my kids did something to make me mad or upset and then I just like let it go. You know, a month later, we were just like and then we just never really talked about it again and got it resolved. Where it's like everyone just says they're sorry and let's just move on that's kind of how I dealt with things my whole life, I guess, and. My husband hates it, he was like you should like he thinks I should be added on for the rest of the world, and I don't i'm just like I want to move forward, I still want a relationship with them tomorrow is not promised."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so when someone has porous boundary they over share personal information have difficulty saying no and all really concerned with the opinions of other would be you think are the pros and cons of porous boundary describe an area of your life, where you hate poorly."
13780.0,Patient,"And I can say, probably with my children, I do I go above and beyond for them if they're having a hard time in their life or you know I try to. I go to bed early because I wake up early in the morning to come to work, I come to work at four in the morning, so sometimes my. My kids will not one of them now, but he'll call me in the middle of the night or text me in the middle of the night and it wakes us up. I won't respond, but my husband gets mad because he's like he thinks that that's rude because he shouldn't call in the middle of the night and i'm like I understand, so I understand where he's coming from but. I have you know, and I told him what calling like in the middle of the night it's rude you know i'm sleeping."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13780.0,Patient,"But it just doesn't work out in my favor because then, I still forgive him for calling in the middle of the night or whatever. So it's like I understand part of it, but then like I like I said I forgive and I move on."
740.0,Provider,So.
13780.0,Patient,"that's for me because i'm not really setting that boundary it's like what do I have to do block you at nighttime so that you can call me But what if it's an emergency, then you feel bad."
740.0,Provider,When you put your phone on do not disturb you know. yeah but so with a porous and what it is that you're too involved in the church to in mesh with other people.
13780.0,Patient,"yeah that would be much but wallet my my youngest child while he's 20 you'll be 26 he involves me with everything and so. Like he counts on me a lot like for a lot of different things, and so i'm always basically there and available to him, even though I try to set my boundaries and be like no. Like last night he text me at 730 at night and i'm like i'm going to bed, I have to be at work in the morning. And then he still continued to text me throughout the night and i'm like I didn't respond to that I was sleeping, but it was like you know i'm asleep, why are you still texting me. So it sucks because then it's an argument with my husband again because he was texting me in the middle of the night. And i'm like why didn't answer like you know me i'm just like why didn't answer so I don't understand just move on like I can't control of what he did. Just like I can't control you being mad at me right now, because. He text me."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely athey it seems like he wants you to what is it seems like the boundaries that you're trying to put with between you and your husband he wants you to put that in between you and your children, yes."
13780.0,Patient,"He says, I love them more I do more for them, I do this, I do that and i'm like I don't do anything for them like I don't like I. said I you know i've done i've i'm, this is the best that i've done by setting my boundaries of my children and they know that now. Like I can't just jump up in the middle of the night and go get you or do this or do that because you're drunk or your this or you know. Because i've always wanted them to be safe and now i'm like you guys are adults, like you need to figure it out if it's an emergency I got you, but if it's not an emergency, no."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. last one, and this is a good one. In some relationship healthy boundaries same to form naturally and easily and other relationships, however, setting setting healthy boundaries is difficult, what challenges have you faced when trying to set healthy boundaries and how did you overcome them or how could you overcome them."
13780.0,Patient,"So i'm still working on that we're trying to set healthy boundaries and. Trying to let my husband know that I have an opinion also and it's okay for me to think differently than he does like just he's not the boss of me just because you feel a certain way, does not make you the boss of me, and I am not your. possession i'm a person and i'm entitled to my opinion and to my beliefs. hmm so i'm still i'm working on that i'm good trying to get back to that."
740.0,Provider,Let me ask you this. Do you ever have the time.
13780.0,Patient,"We did have good times and then kind of covert here and everything just kind of like went kind of. I don't know like where we just didn't do anything so like my husband was he so he and I, and I understand where he's coming from like so he got more focused because we bought a house, so he got more focused on doing things to the House. Where i'm like i'm the type of person like I like to go do things, even if it's like we live 30 minutes from the beach like let's go walk on the beach so let's go. Do this let's go do that just get out of the House, and he didn't really want to and didn't really want it like you know it was our end of it was like our anniversary don't want to do anything. And, which is fine, but i'm like okay well let's just make the best of it, but then, but then, when our friends have an anniversary Oh well, let's go let's go party and let's go do that and i'm like well, what about so like. Right now, like and so like it kind of hurt my feelings, but then I just got over it so then like my friend's. birthday her 50th birthday, we went to Cancun, and he got mad at me because he's like you went to Cancun without me and i'm like I been telling you let's go and you don't want to go i'm like I was like i'm gonna go with the girls, I told you that and he got mad at me. But it's not like I need like I should be able to have a say so and i'm like why it's my friends 50th birthday, it was a girl trip it wasn't you know. I don't know. But he's still mad at me about that."
740.0,Provider,"I guess i'm just trying to figure out like what the real problem, like wow."
13780.0,Patient,I think it's a control thing I think he's just like very jealous and very controlling and i'm like I don't want to be. Like that I don't want to. be unhappy I don't I don't know.
740.0,Provider,"Well, I would say. You know, like you say it to continue to work on you. And I know it's hard, I can imagine the difficulty, maybe 15 live in such a toxic environment."
13780.0,Patient,"Right that's why I just try not to argue, you know I just. I just don't want I don't have that energy to argue anymore i'm just like i'm tired, but you know."
740.0,Provider,You don't want to argue with you don't want to be passive either you don't want to go.
13780.0,Patient,Right right. to stick up for me and my beliefs.
740.0,Provider,"Right, so it just one of those things because I mean like I said you don't I don't want you to fill out Oh, I just have to let everything go and you know I just have to agree with everything he says, I can see it, so I said man that's not healthy either."
13780.0,Patient,"No it's not good. And I think for too long now. And I think that's kind of where the problem would start to because so he was starting nagging that he's the one he's the type that will follow you around the House and, like. get his point across so I you know, like and then we'd start drinking so then my whole voice came out, then when I start drinking so that's where. Because if he started in on me, then, I would just stand up for myself and then it ended up being a bigger. battle than what it was, but then, at the same since I get upset because it's like I should be able to drink and have a good time also. You know what I mean, why do you have to nag at me why do you have to put me down, why do you have to talk bad about my children or whatever, and the same with his kids he you know he has a lot of children and. He talks about about them and I stick up for them also i'm like you know what you don't know what's going on in their life. You should not talk bad about them like you don't know what they're going through like what gives you the right to put somebody else down. And so, so it's not even just my children, you know he does it with everybody and like it's a joke and he'll that joke about people and it bothers me and i'm like, why do you feel like you have to put yourself above everybody else you're not better than anybody. But I don't know how to get that point across to him, because he doesn't get it, he still thinks like you know he's the guy that walks past the mirror and looks at himself and let you know and i'm like seriously like no that's not you."
740.0,Provider,"I guess, I will a win. win because it hasn't always been like this, since i've been there for the whole to the heavier the window."
13780.0,Patient,"Oh yeah literally like right after we got married. We went on our honeymoon came back, and so I thought I thought it was just the stress of buying the House and getting situated, you know that's kind of what I thought, like so I was, like all right, you know we all stress out, you know oh yeah but it just hasn't stopped. And then, more drink and then Colbert and then more drinking and, like every day drink em you know, sometimes it might have been a couple drinks, sometimes it was a lot of drink some you know. And then yeah i'm just like I can't. And then it got how I ended up in this situation is I ended up to a point where. He my grandson was over, and I had been drinking and he had been drinking also when my grandson was there, because I was watching him because his mom is the my grandson's mother was like going through a little mental breakdown, so I. I was like oh i'll keep them tonight and i'll take them to the sitter in the morning, I get up early like I said so usually if I stopped drinking i'll drink in the mid afternoon and then. i'll go to bed like 730 or whatever seven 730 so and I was out there with my grandson we had went swimming and we're just hanging out I wasn't I was intoxicated but I wasn't like belligerently drunk or anything like that. And he just started in on me and I was like he's like i'm calling his mom he's going home with his mom I said no, please don't do that, like she's going through it right now please don't. Like I don't know why you have to do that, so he called her had her come pick him up after that I lost it like I lost my cool and I was like i'm gonna kill myself. i'm tired of you doing this to me you control every aspect of my life, and I just like went off, and so, then he called the COPs on me and they took me in and had me committed."

But that that's what I was saying, my final straw was when he tried to take my grandson from me, or you did he told you know he controlled that situation and I lost it, I was like this is not okay. And so, then I was like i'll just kill myself and like I went and I grabbed a knife. Like if I was going to do something to myself, but then after I you know your common sense comes back I just put the knife down and i'm like what are you doing. So I left I left the House, and he called the COPs on me, but I have a tracker on my phone so he knew where I was at and they came and got me. So that's what i'm it's just like yeah but he doesn't you know, then, then he called my step down was like oh I saved her life, and this satiny i'm like no you didn't I put the knife down I I did that on my own when my reality kicked in I was like what are you doing. Like you know and. So that's where this all snowballed from and i'm like Okay, I need to. I need to work on me and I need to fix me because you're hurting me like you know, and I take responsibility for my actions but i'm like he's. mentally getting into my head, where I want to do something to myself and that's not okay like tinder get your you know i'm talking to myself and get your shit together, you need to fix the situation or move on. Because yeah like I said he's been physically abusive to me, also where i'm just like you know I I feel. Like I was trying to explain to somebody like I don't need like I didn't even feel like myself, I don't even feel like myself anymore i'm not because usually i'm the happy laughing go lucky person and I don't feel that that anymore and i'm just like I want myself back."
