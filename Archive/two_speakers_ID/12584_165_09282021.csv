165.0,Provider,"you're not supposed to be like you're at a point where you're not supposed to get more medication until you're seeing this. encounter right now isn't you really being seen because i'm not a doctor. All I can really do is give you a bridge prescription. and your last appointment was two weeks ago and your next appointment is tbd. um. What are your withdrawal symptoms right now. What withdrawal symptoms are you. experiencing Michael. Michael. Michael. Hello. Michael. Getting a patient, a message number 913 35 so initiated encounter 1324 pst ended at 1334 or 1324 to 1334 pst patient needs less medication was four to five days ago patient has no way to get to group and no way to. Know Internet until at least Friday patient is he's denying relapse and he doesn't want to relapse but he doesn't have. there's no urine drug screen ever done he's been a patient since June there's just no way that I can justify giving this patient medication without. Some sort of effort on his part his girlfriend always shows up to the encounters instead of him, he wanted to have her to the N m. This is an appropriate behavior the patient needs to be an adult and get something done if the patient can do something and help us out then i'd be a lot more inclined to help the patient get medication, but I don't feel comfortable. As i'm not a prescriber giving this patient, a bridge therapy from no point A to Point B so Michael Preston 1324 to 1334 Pacific standard time no further action needed at this time."
