15881.0,Patient,hi hi hi your name and date for me. Nicole June June 14 1990.
498.0,Provider,How we feeling today.
15881.0,Patient,"um I just feel so crummy on this pill like i'm still my body of stuff and I haven't been sleeping well, I would say i'm sleeping like four hours a night. sort of like on and off in and out asleep. And then the blurriness is going away a little bit, but from a distance it's still pretty bad i'm actually thinking and I wanted to ask you about like medical leave from work I could maybe get a note for like a week or two i'm not sure how long. yeah because it's been such so hard at work for me and I don't want to do a bad job and lose my job so."
498.0,Provider,Now that's absolutely fine. When you at the end of our visit today i'll bring someone in and just have them document something up just related to you know if you feel like a week off what kind of give you a chance to stop. So we last night and the night before you only took the five milligrams right.
15881.0,Patient,"Yes, just a single pill yeah."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and. abilify has a pretty long half life. I was thinking about this when I talk to you on Tuesday. So i'm happy to hear that the blurred vision, it sounds like what you said is cleared up just a tad bit and we won't i'm not really expecting to see any. Real resolve with respect to like the side effects until tomorrow tomorrow will be maybe Saturday morning tomorrow Saturday morning we'll be right about 72 hours. And that's when you'll kind of level out to. The dosage of five milligrams instead of 7.5, but I still wanted to see you today just to see if you felt any any you know kind of resolve or improvement in any of the symptoms. Is that. The side effect of the vacation."
15881.0,Patient,"not really i'm just like so fidgety when I work, I have to like work and then walk around like piece around a little bit. I just I don't know i'm still worried that this is not the pill for me or that i'm supposed to be on like a much smaller dosage. Man it's going to ask you, like eventually. If I could maybe switch or if i'm Oh, are you still there. i'm still here was no window okay. Or if, like there's even a way to go, natural or holistic not sure."
498.0,Provider,"We don't have any like a homeopathic methods here. I don't I have not I kind of have two options on the table is what I was considering one to kind of continue to taper you down just to see if you continue to. receive in a bit benefit from the medication and then to see if the side effects subside tomorrow Saturday at five milligrams and then possibly consider tapering you further down to two and a half milligrams which would be just a half of tablet. But that's not something that we would want to do abruptly, because it could you know calls, you know adverse effects correct. So if you. If the if you if you continue to be okay at five milligrams and the side effects, improve then that may be best for you. If you're still not you know hearing any voices, if you are able to. You know, progress throughout your day more effectively and the side effects, you know, continue to subside and we find a happy space at somewhere between. Two and a half milligrams and five milligrams then great If not, then we'll continue to take you down and then bridge in an alternate medication. In order to combat you know the auditory hallucinations which is like I said we'll kind of do on both now kind of tapering that abilify down slowly, so that you know you don't run into any more worsening effects and then. kind of assessing how you feel. The presence of any you know voices or anything and then, if it's Okay, we bridge in another medication, but. Just stopping taking it would not be recommended."
15881.0,Patient,I wouldn't do that I just was like wondering. Most normal.
498.0,Provider,"I know I bet both of those options are kind of what we're navigating through now. I know that we didn't necessarily have an appointment that but. Today is Thursday another two days will be 48 hours, I really like to see how you're doing in 48 hours at. The bottom milligrams yeah. yeah if if you're doing Okay, if you there's any improvement in the in the blurred vision, you said you feel stiffness Is that correct."
15881.0,Patient,"yeah I still feel that like answering this and, like my muscles are so stuff."
498.0,Provider,What. Are you taking anything else any vitamins any supplements anything else.
15881.0,Patient,i'm taking be 12. which I read online was good and then i'm taking this thing called alpha brain. Which is like it looks like this. And it's mostly just be six.
498.0,Provider,"Okay. Of course, those B vitamins kind of increase our metabolism. And like you know, give us energy and maybe kind of pulling back. From off of those B vitamins, but I had what are you take you to the taking them like today, and yes i'm taking them today, but I took them like."
15881.0,Patient,i've been taking them before yeah.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's refrain from taking those as well for the next couple of days. I really want you know you to try to find like a happy medium, where you're not exhausted, but you still you know still enough energy to make it through your day. So is the is the tightness that you are describing is it is, it does it feel like muscle tightening or does it feel like you know. Energy that you, you, you want to expel."

498.0,Provider,Taking anything else other than the be 12 and the basics.
15881.0,Patient,"Just my birth control, my Salah or it's like a generic of yasmin I think."

498.0,Provider,"Okay, I. I think that. eliminated that beast that be six that be 12. will do a lot for the jitteriness that you feel, and I think if we could get a handle on that, then. You may you know see some improvement in in you know the lightheadedness, you know as well. You just pick your record here."

It has a side effect of like. what's called across Asia and that's kind of like feeling like you know your muscles want to constantly move. yeah it's not that you it's not you know, a complete fun phenomenon and it's just that typically it it resolved, you know as as you continue to use it i'm. Bringing you down to the five milligrams daily as long as you continue to. Not hearing the voices, then you know we could counteract that and maybe actually today, we may try you out on maybe a short term loans, does it as a pain, maybe one milligram of. cogent and then that way you'll feel you know some you'll feel you know some immediate relief from you know just the jitteriness. that's not that that'll is something that you get resolved today and then that'll allow us to see if the five milligrams of abilify continues to work for you over the weekend, you won't have to check in with me every you know 48 hours until unless, of course, you know you find some.
