105.0,Provider,"Any. I always like to find out, you know the context of how a meeting you anything kind of going on presently is your common in here right now."
10410.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm doing i'm doing better. Today last week was pretty crazy I am i'm not the tickets to withdraw or the lead I just felt like I was getting very anxious and frustrated. me and Joseph ended up getting in a big fight I said a lot of things I didn't mean and things were just coming out of my mouth and I like couldn't control them, and it was just getting worse and worse and. I am, you know I feel really bad for the things i've said, and how would even got to that point and. So i've really been trying to work on myself this week and. You know, try to. realize why it was acting out the way it was and why he said the things I did, and it made him say certain things, and then it made me go back more and. It was just. yeah it was just a lot and. It was. Like we were literally enemies trying to tear one one another down yeah."
105.0,Provider,i'm wondering so on the front end let's just see what your summary of insight is when you say I tried to understand why I did this what's your summary of that.
10410.0,Patient,"Well, but i'm just I don't know I don't know um, but I just know that I don't feel right I it's hard for me to. I cry any any for any little thing I am. Pretty frustrated easily it's been a lot harder for me to to babysit my nephew um. I feel like. I don't know I just feel different I feel different but I I know it's a my mind is changing my there's a lot going on in my body now, so I try to tell myself that as well."
105.0,Provider,"Good so let's let's just let me. Bring the template down. Your body's changing you're noticing your interactions with people. are different. you're doing your best to remember your physiology is changing right you're hearing about the the domain production you're hearing and I think that's getting in. So that you're getting Okay, and I think i'm hearing you say I need to be patient with it and it's hard because i'm irritable and tearful. Yes, okay. All right, so what that might need is just some patience and now i'd like to actually hear your summary about you probably asked yourself why did I go to war with Joseph how did you answer that when you did the work and you try to analyze it."
10410.0,Patient,"first started coming up as i'm selfish and and you know, I was."
105.0,Provider,"Saying who you're saying, if you are he's saying it."
10410.0,Patient,"No, I am i'm thinking to myself in my mind when i'm trying to think you know why am I acting this way Why am I acting out that i'm selfish and that. That i'm doing it because i'm selfish and i'm you know I will I don't feel good in the moment i'm not happy, I want to make him not happy."
105.0,Provider,Okay. Okay stay there. Just imagine everyone does this thing have I feel this I don't know how to express it what i'll do instead. Is have them feel like I feel. So let's go back. What is it when you looked over at him. You may you ended up making him feel like what.
10410.0,Patient,That he's not enough.
105.0,Provider,"But he doesn't do enough. that's right. So maybe you were in i'm not enough. And not know how to communicate that. And so you cut him to shreds did you yeah okay everyone does that. You hearing me how do I know what i'm talking about because everybody does it you see your smiling I even saw your teeth. it's Okay, if you knew how to express i'm not worthy, you would have done it, but you didn't. that's okay that's why you're here you're getting closer and closer to being able to recognize. i'm triggered my worthiness is triggered and instead of having someone else feel that same thing you're going to be able to eventually say i'm activated. i'm triggered. Rational rational irrational don't know it's happening, make sure you're able to focus does your baby. it's Okay, if you need to attend because you'll be distracted just make sure you do everything you need."
10410.0,Patient,"i'm sorry that was my name. You see that's why. i'm i'm almost hosted companies to to help because I have my nephew here as well, and I have my son setup which is him he's very even with everything he's. become give me one second i'm so sorry right back then come back that's fine just kind of do."
105.0,Provider,Okay. let's hear a little bit about. How long did that fight last.
10410.0,Patient,for about two hours and then he ended up leaving to his brothers.
105.0,Provider,at any point were you able to see what you were doing you couldn't see it you're just in the anger you're just like you're not giving me what I need you're the problem joe's.
10410.0,Patient,yeah hundred percent. hundred percent hundred percent.
105.0,Provider,And how are things now.
10410.0,Patient,"they're better they're a lot better but. i'm afraid that's going to come out again i'm afraid because i'm flooring and I still have little ways to go, that is just going to get worse and I don't I don't want it, I don't want it to. me make us hate one another or. I don't want to say things I don't mean because it was getting to the point where I could have said some really hurtful stuff."
105.0,Provider,What would have been the worst thing you could say to them.
10410.0,Patient,"Probably about his mom. I would never but like it comes in my head because. He says some things where it really hurts me inside like. You know just he he knows when he's hurt he knows what to say to get me her, so I think when. He says certain things in my mind i'm like Okay, you want to say those things, I think, say some things back to hurt your feelings, but I try not I try not to go too deep because you know I never used to he this is normal for him, I yeah i've never really been in a. relationship where you know people talk to each other kind of like that, because we had a long. couple of years at the beginning, where it was normal for us to to be harsh with one another to. win it wouldn't happen often, but when we would get mad when we fight we would say mean things to one another, and I was never used to that because I I didn't really date much, and when I did it was nothing like that and. I think it took a long time to kind of get us both out of those habits, to turn to we right away, and we still do it and we both try to talk to one another, we both get barium."
105.0,Provider,"la take a breath breathe. Okay now let the shoulder stay there, read into the belly. And exhale out. The next one, I want this to be the longest exhale I want you to portion it make it the longest exhale you've ever had okay. And slowly out the mouth. One more time, one more time in the belly shoulders don't move. Long exhale. stay there, I. feel. and think this horrible thought this yucky thought joseph's mother and it is this just saying."
10410.0,Patient,I I feel. they're both awful to one another.
105.0,Provider,"They were awful to each other. I think it is my opinion they were awful to each other. So listen now just imagine it over here with some distance. I think you're you and your mom treated each other, poorly I think it it's affected you Joseph. what's so bad about that."
10410.0,Patient,"I think he wants to see his mom and a perfect way because she passed. He he lets us like sometimes he'll at that side, where you'll say some stories of what she did when they were younger and what things he's done to her, but it's very rare that that he'll let that side come out it's more the good times and. And it's very hard to because I try to explain that to him to um because he says, like his mom is the only person that he had in that he was that's why he still messed up now, because that is long, as the only person he had in Scotland now she's gone, but she was. i'm not trying to being."
105.0,Provider,don't digress it me. You don't go backwards just say.
10410.0,Patient,"She wasn't there for him, she would leave them for for for men, she would. Even as a young boy, she would drop them off with family members and disappear for months away. She would drink by they would physically beat each other up in front of him, he would have to try to protect her."
105.0,Provider,"Like a scores for Joseph palm hi esports Joseph yeah. yeah okay so we'll win a pin that notion, because it might be a useful resource for you in empowering your sweetheart for him to know himself and to free himself from this single way of having to glorify mother. Which means ignoring the wounds. He stuck. And that's the risk, as you do this work la as you become more insightful you're going to see everyone's wounds. But it's no one's asking you. No one's asking you. To highlight them you're in therapy they're not so come back into here it's not your job, because what you're doing is highlighting his problems and not owning yours. So you can be humble there you can say oh shoot. Right. that's all that's all. You model this hard work you do this hard work he may come on board. But right now, you you're going to not be able to sell it if you're just a B I T C H, you know selling this this therapy business i'm exaggerating obviously to kind of add some humor."
10410.0,Patient,You know.
105.0,Provider,I hope you're laughing.
10410.0,Patient,No it's true or other. Little brush.
105.0,Provider,"But you're at it, but this isn't you didn't study this you don't you don't you know we're meeting very little you know this is hard to do you're now feeling your feelings, I believe you have unprocessed trauma that we've just and then we backed away that's Okay, but it's there. it's threatening."
10410.0,Patient,"I don't want and that's the thing too I don't like to even I don't know to even go there, just like he has done things he doesn't even like to go there with and I know it's his mom that's like my things that I just."
105.0,Provider,"wanted to say. So you're a bully and you make him go there, think about it."
10410.0,Patient,"yeah I am I do I start it and then, when he comes well I don't start mean beings that's the thing I start an argument and then he gets frustrated says me things and then I come back with some meetings but. I try not to ever because I don't know my you can we could all pass tomorrow, we could all we never know what could happen and."
105.0,Provider,"If it meant stead of you, avoiding looking at your own truth. Then you wouldn't be and I use the word bullying, because sometimes it's a good way for us to see i'm i'm trying to get someone else to do the hard work that I don't want to do. And you're able to say it here I go there."
10410.0,Patient,No i'm meeting with my past like my thing was that he doesn't even know about.
105.0,Provider,"Right I get it that's what this is for in here. is to have some reprocessing of that history, so your relationship with it is different, so that you don't act out. When you. have an integrated sense of this happened and watch I can sit with it here in my awareness, I don't have a panic attack. And I like it kind of crummy but you know what it's opened my heart to people that I wouldn't normally have opened my heart to. And i'm still lovable when you can get there, instead of you going. Ah, then I know you free processed it. For now, your psyche says. we're going to project over here. and have him do it, but it ends up feeling like you're a bully he has to go do that work. So it gets very complicated very fast, so if we say all of that aside. If what i'm saying is true. The more resilience, the more that you change your relationship with that history. The less you're going to be going to fight. The less you'll demand that other people change it'll be just your regular you'll get to decide if this is a good fit this relationships, a good fit, so be it, but you gotta change change here's the deal. You can ask them. hmm they say no, then maybe you stay with them, and you decide on i'm going to put up with this nonsense, because the good outweighs the bad sometimes we say goodbye to people, but that will take its form without. Making them demanding gotta ask sometimes the answer's no and people part for years, sometimes they come back together sometimes they never do. But that's not what we're up to here. we're up to you were up to as this medication goes down this stuff is threatening to overwhelm you is history. And you either meet it with integrity. or it'll come out in super creepy weird ways that you're not proud of right now it's coming out kind of weird we can kind of like angry and hostile and violent. Because, if you think about this le this is deeply wounding what he went through. What you guys are coming out each other with aggression and violence, really. Imagine me coming at you with violence, because you're wondering. How does that make sense. But that's what you do that's what most people do. So bizarre instead of coming at it with tenderness and compassion."
10410.0,Patient,"yeah I just I think I don't know how to get there, I tried it. I don't know how to express myself and then, when I try to say something, and we just fight it just turns it never goes away I plan it to go."
105.0,Provider,"The short answer, is this, you can be compassionate with your own tender vulnerable parts. So how you supposed to do it for someone else's you haven't had the skill to sit with you you've been you've done it bit by bit you've been doing it and you are changing your relationship with those memories, bit by bit. But i'm really explaining to you, so you have an explanation about what might be some good grief push why Okay, because i'm not doing it inside here. So, as I say this. And it might be off in the distance is there. Some curiosity that maybe the way to healing is not to run from your history, but to have a new relationship with your history. A little Part A little curiosity."
10410.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't know how I get how to get there, or how to start."
105.0,Provider,You have actually done it for a little windows of times you were able to go there. And we didn't stay there long which you did go there. Okay. But what happens we're going to move into it now what happens is. anxiety shows up to protect you from feeling into it and anger can show up to protect you and your body can really distract you. Right.
10410.0,Patient,Doria. strikes me for. Everything so.
105.0,Provider,"yeah the body can say notice the heart racing something this is life threatening this is this is catastrophic, well then, what you don't have to do when you're busy doing that. Is feel into whatever this wounding is."
10410.0,Patient,"And there are a lot of the times when I have anxiety and. In the moment of my panic and ugliness my memory disappears, and I remember, of course, but like certain things that are happening around that time like. let's say if I get a phone call while having anxiety, I will. It will be kind of hard for me to remember that phone call i'll have to sit there and really think about okay what was said on that phone call what was. What was I needed to write down or what would what did I need to remember from that phone call and it'll be kind of hard for me, and I know I noticed that I can't really remember a lot of things, so I have to are. have to sit there and think over and over again, but i'm and i'm in panic mode, a lot of my life and I like that."
105.0,Provider,"and your memory is going to be terrible. But that's not a moral failure that is brain tissue that's the amygdala it cuts off the prefrontal cortex i'm gonna give you one story, you need to give yourself this out. Just imagine that there's a we got to go way back saber tooth tiger coming at me. listen closely, do you think it would be efficient if I analyzed oh my gosh I his left tooth is a little longer than the right one oh look at that, for me, that would make a nice coat do you think that that is what I should be thinking about. What should I what Should I be doing wanting. That is the part of the brain this activity that is the alarm system first brain to make develop it hijacks means cuts off this and for good reason back when. We had saber tooth Tigers and dinosaurs whatnot we all have those or is still going it happens on a phone call when we perceive abandonment conflict threat. Things that we have no label for. It cuts off your ability to think forward and to remember. It is not a moral failure we've got to get your ability to manage that first brain response. Because the truth is. you're really not an actual danger you perceive it, though, nonetheless, got to get in there. Okay, give yourself an hour, so you save yourself, this is just my brain thinking i'm in danger, this is just my brand thinking i'm in danger. i've got my breathing i've got to do i've got to do okay i'll do peripheral vision we just look ahead, what do I see my right. I see gracie Brown and see if I can stay looking for here, I see some blinds us you like you get yourself this body has got to feel safe in order to turn off that that alarm. In your brain work I know it will, this is science it's not a hack it's not a trick. we've got to have your body believes that you're safe you're displaying will work that are this one okay up here in the front. Just remember that."
10410.0,Patient,"yeah I try to I try to remember that and it helps a lot of the times, a lot of times we'll turn it around when. I feel like you know something's going on with my body, I think something's wrong and also myself how many times have you been to the emergency room your hearts fine. you're fine and most the time they'll turn around. So some of the times, it takes a little bit more, but. i'm just happy that i'm not where I was on methadone because I. I used to think I was dying at least three four times a week, I was going to the emergency room so much, I felt like they weren't going to help me no more because. i'm going for the littlest reasons why not little as to me because I, my oxygen is super low it they do admit me because I am maxim's low and everything's freaking out my policy but um it's because I make myself that way i'm not really my body's not had any help but yeah. But i'm just. it's hard for me to get my brain to tell myself Look how many times have you been there you go to the doctor you're healthy but literally five minutes later i'll be thinking my whole body shutting down. or my chest."
105.0,Provider,"What would it be like today. Just spend and I can set a timer. or a few minutes. Just being with a protective part it might be. panic. It could be you know all the symptoms ago with that that's protective part. But what that'll be blended with and probably activate. Is a little bit of the early trauma, but I could set an alarm and your protective parts might feel reassured that we won't be there for long we won't do this for long there we won't have to make contact with that vulnerability for long. If I were to set an alarm on my phone here. what's a reasonable amount of time that we might spend possibly. Holding space for some of those pretty old experiences like childhood. You can say exactly what the number is and i'm going to say yes."
10410.0,Patient,four minutes two minutes.
105.0,Provider,"To you want to okay. So start doing your breathing i'm going to set it to him and now what's really important is that I keep my promises in it. Once you think that's important yes. And what I like is that your your protective parts for said for men, they felt it and then corrected it to to that's what I like. I like that it did that. Good so i'm going to go ahead and turn this around and we're going to start this puppy. We go. So just get a sense. Of the earliest time that you had. A stress reaction in the body of something's wrong. Right. What age was."
10410.0,Patient,six or seven.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, what are you noticing in your body right now."
10410.0,Patient,i'm looking at the templates in my throat chest.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so breathe into throat breathe into it. This is now. that's scary stuff. is not going to happen again. i'm in this adult body feel. The adult body, the throat in the chest. can picture the difference shape and size of body just be present in your adult body. And that six year old self. Never has to feel that again. Because if you're willing, you can take her inside of this adult body of yours, let her know you're safe here will never let that happen to you again you're here safe inside of me and closing the door. To the scary stuff you're safe here inside of me. In this adult body. feel the truth of it, make it so help her. safe. And two minutes that's elapsed take as long as you. Keep breathing into the throat and chest envisioning her safe she never asked for that account she's safe inside of you. your eyes are open and you look in here. want to process with this was for you."
10410.0,Patient,"The beginning I felt very tight, especially my stomach started to get like turning and nauseous. But when I started to. Think about my younger self and embracing her and. Keeping her safe and. It made me sad but. Like feel good for for a second. Okay."
105.0,Provider,"Ask the part that may be as angry or the one that. Maybe wants to get you anxious check and see what is the think of what we did. might be hard, this is a complex yeah close your eyes. What is the one that makes you. Have heart racing short breaths sweaty palms and panic is that part think what you just did two minutes."
10410.0,Patient,"That it was it was good work that I need to keep myself safe and all my all my parts. Just not now, but my. All of me."
105.0,Provider,Turn toward that protective part again and ask it it's like did this more. Good to work less to make the panicked.
10410.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"i'm hearing sounds just want to make sure you're taking care of yourself and your environment as well everything's okay. Yes, okay all right. Well, what do you think of that that you just got a yes."
10410.0,Patient,"It feels good i'm going to really try to I forget I forget these things, the I I know because this last time it made me feel better too when I made my safe room and with my teenage self are right, I think she was like nine or eight but. That made me feel a lot better as well, I forget these things I need to learn to practice them and I have it written down in my in my journal, but it's needed."
105.0,Provider,"But remember you won't remember when your body perceives danger. yeah gotta start and that's why we right away, I teach that breathing and you can you can go to safe place and imagery whatever techniques work for some people, they. I don't know if you've you were in a in a group right taught the tapping. Right this. I think we do here, people different people do it differently, the collarbone can do it with one hand I like crossing over when you do like this, I, like the cross the bilateral stuff and then down to the hip. You can grab something. This. kind of bumpy smooth it moves. it's really smooth and cool. So so sort of sort of that's slimy that slick Ridge. rubbery. that's how you get back in your body that one is grounding the five senses and all I did was touch. it's hard to remember these in the moment and why I just told you earlier, why it's hard to remember."
10410.0,Patient,Her panic mode. While i'm in panic mode.
105.0,Provider,"The alarm called the amygdala you may just remember the alarm is cutting off thinking parts and then remember. It cuts it off, and why it's not efficient but that's really old that brain is super old we don't have saber tooth and when you're just talking to someone trying to schedule an appointment. saber tooth the body still believes it's life threatening, so the more that we can have q's, the more you have sticking posters things on your hand reminders more you practice this when the stress response response is not there, so, for example. You did this. When you're not in a stress response you're at least establishing a neural connection, so that you can remember it. When you need it so doing a more often, you know you said, well, I can't remember any it, but because you're probably not practicing and throughout the day when you're actually feeling like a normal person you're not activated so. I don't mind me and a broken record just do it more when you wake up second consciousness, I do the breathing. scan my body don't even know my skin feeling the sheets that's my hip fill my arm feel my shoulder I had one pays attention to that. you're thinking about your day you're off and running, but having these practices means they're there for you and there's recall when you need them. that's the logic behind it. None of us can remember when we're in sabretooth moment. But i'm better at it, because I do these things, all the time and then I teach them to you guys, so I i'm like oh mercy wow my freaking out i'm freaking out. Oh hold on just a second. They don't know what i'm doing I could be answering the door picking up a baby taking food out of the oven. i'm just taking care of myself, you can do that. Oh sorry to keep you on hold okay what was that again, you said no one's available until the 13th mm hmm can you put me on a waitlist. What do you need to do to remember, I don't live your life you got a Lhasa people pulling attention Left and Right, what do you need to do to remember."
10410.0,Patient,"me some I need my own time together, I gotta at least give me. start off at least 15 minutes a day or 10 minutes a day and then work up you know, trying to work on those things meditation."
105.0,Provider,When when can you take time for air.
10410.0,Patient,"Probably when everybody falls asleep just because the mornings are so hectic I don't think it was. I mean it probably would benefit more in the morning but i'm just always such a rush, probably in that. After afternoons night time."
105.0,Provider,"So that's fine you can do that's fine, but I want you to hear whether it really is reasonable, what you just said i'm gonna say it back to you I don't have time for 60 seconds of breathing. Before my alarm goes off Is that true."
10410.0,Patient,"um no I meant like 1015 minutes to sit there and do the. I know, like practices."
105.0,Provider,"But that's fine, but here what I just said, also."
10410.0,Patient,"Is it true, I can do that."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so there is some time, so the second that's the routine and you may do it for the rest of your life that's how powerful this is oh oh i'm awake guys have an open i'm away. Oh snap I don't want to my alarm hasn't found yet wonder if I have a few more hours I don't know what you're gonna be thinking, but you know what i'm awake. Here I go i'm going to start doing my breathing. And the scan my body. You know, you might do the body scan that i've done with you when you picture this light going through this perfect temperature, how does my head feel as it feeling Hello. forehead eyes mouth neck shoulders chest arms gut bottom legs you do a scan you can do that, why is it only takes a few seconds. So, yes 10 minutes you can carve out in the evening and i'm going to add that to your treatment plan if it isn't already here but also second you become conscious. Maybe you call awake is when your eyes are up and you're out of bed, but conscious means you're no longer in one of those sleep state cycles, you know when you're awake don't you. yeah okay."
10410.0,Patient,Because you start the free one.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so do that not only is that amazing if you want to go back to sleep, by the way. But it's a wonderful way to set in motion mindfulness and i'm okay in this moment. It sets in motion a tone for the rest of the day. Okay, so let me just see what's already in here and see what we got. Alright, so 10 minutes. you're going to set aside in the evening you said. For whether it's prayer whether it's meditation. Clearing your mind might be include some stretching while you're doing it might you know, be a combination of that movement and reflection. To purely practice the skills so that they are remembered when you most need them Okay, I want to talk freely to people without worrying do more hobbies under control, my feelings and thoughts, so I don't have anxiety attacks. So this one was, I will learn emotion regulation skills and control process trauma okay let's add one, because this is very behavioral I targeted so we'll do this. client will just be an objective, the goal is still the same the ones you have you know. This one is probably a connected with this one learn to control my feelings and thoughts, so I don't have anxiety attacks and probably just going to take that goal. copy it and we're going to add and you'll do the 10 minutes each evening now how realistic, is it you're going to be able to do this every evening what if you just. Increased it from zero to a number that you could succeed at this month."
10410.0,Patient,yeah. Like start off a couple three minutes and then work up.
105.0,Provider,Three times a day two times a day I mean i'm not a day a week I mean.
10410.0,Patient,Three now i'm. Probably start off three because I think tell myself to do yoga every day to when I.
105.0,Provider,That doesn't happen about twice i'm going to try my hardest.
10410.0,Patient,So about three times three times a week for about three minutes. start off.
105.0,Provider,You think you could do three times a week.
10410.0,Patient,For 10 minutes. yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I would, I would say, you were going to forget unless you have a way an alarm."
10410.0,Patient,"yeah i'm gonna know i'm gonna set my alarm, I am i'm going to i'm going to do it i'm gonna. I really do it now i've been doing actually a lot better I feel better. About myself because i've been thinking a lot better about things and I usually down myself right away, but um i've been doing a lot better, so I I really want to keep up with doing these things."
105.0,Provider,"Go ahead set set it now i'm going to write the goal, while you're setting it if you drop off video just come right back. Oh you're doing on a different vice perfect yeah so i'm going to just the goal here just keep putting that in place now reasonable time anything they'll be asleep. here's what I wrote client will increase from zero times a week to three minutes three times a week the practicing. Of. mindfulness practicing it's not great grammar but of yoga belly breathing and grounding the five senses, I can change it if those aren't the things you're going to do you tell me what you're going to do during those three minutes."
10410.0,Patient,No just definitely breathing maybe some your. senses.
105.0,Provider,Do you need any review of any of them I can go back over belly breathing and go over how to do grounding in the five senses again.
10410.0,Patient,"No, I I, I know I know how to do them I just need to. Do more at a down."
105.0,Provider,"Good good good good okay sweet, and the other thing, although it's not written down is when you wake up in the morning, when you get up, but when you wake that you, you do at least the breathing. I want to. kind of talk a little bit about. that yes, I want to reschedule with you, but I also want to talk about. Is there any way that you can take what you learned about yourself today. On some of it a little bit. and share it if you wanted to with Joseph like. I had to really think about what was going on. kind of letting him into your world as a part of the repair, because my guess is, would you do just say you were sorry it's up to set off."
10410.0,Patient,"No, no, I told him I apologize to him and I told him that I i've been thinking, he was the problem 100% and that he was. He was. I just blamed him for a lot of a lot of why things aren't working right but it's a lot of it has to do with me because I don't I don't speak so I just let it build up and build up and um but I told him that I I how I felt before, and now we felt like it was a lot of him and. That I got to work on myself and and. Right now."
105.0,Provider,"What What I wonder is, if you actually shared a little bit more meat like we got into the meat of things we got into. Instead of. that's fine if you think the that the relationship is repaired fantastic. You know Okay, so you may consider going back and saying, I know I apologize before, but after I went to therapy you don't have to say that part, but I also realize, I think I. am asking you to do the work that i've been i'm willing to do myself and i'm working on it with with gwen and i'm really sorry that I believe you. Now that's my way of talking right i'm very I can get right to it, you might need to dance around a little more, but the less you dance around the world, direct you are. it's like dang she's really doing it right and then maybe you guys can get back to joking around and playing again quickly. see where where your comfort zone is on that because notice I didn't give any content I didn't say anything about trauma history just now I just said, I think what I was doing. was asking you to do this difficult stuff from your family history that I been really having a hard time doing myself and. i'm sorry I did that I know i'm i'm on the job, each time i'm going to do better and better getting better at it at seen what's my stuff what's your stuff i'm getting there, but this. You didn't sign up you didn't ask to do this healing in this therapy stuff I did and i'm sorry that I asked you to go somewhere, I myself and scared to go. I don't know if that's your truth but that's a way to kind of say it, they can, because now he's not going to feel blamed anymore. Just a thought all right. Do you have anything else to say right here at the end. i'm okay so something. reach out to. During the day i'm year's Eve day at nine and do anything, most people doing the other day to really celebrate that but can you meet at nine on December 31."
10410.0,Patient,yeah I could do that.
105.0,Provider,"If not you'll have plenty of time if if you realize oh my gosh I have this kid thing or whatever, and you just let me know okay. Lots of time to reschedule as needed. Okay, well, I will see you next time in group."
