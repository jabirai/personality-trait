416.0,Provider,when's your court this.
12564.0,Patient,"My court dates are next month i've been going into court dates for approximately a year um I did do six months in jail or in jail, I did three months. Three months at the end of last year and I recently did three more months because. I was up to no good after I got bailed out the first time, so Luckily, there was a there's a there's a not a company a franchise called the bailout project, they were able able to bail me out and send me back to my parents House just in time. My parents are just in time for my parents to you know the pissed off fitness to wear off, so I can come home because they they they were pissed for a long, long time my dad actually sent me back to jail so. It was just getting in trouble, but now i'm like so freaking after been going to jail, the second time i'm so freaking scared I just like I haven't even hung out with anybody yet like."
416.0,Provider,"wow Taylor you can throw line. And, and this is, is this the first time you've been in trouble like this."
12564.0,Patient,"yeah it's um you know I had a bad I had a bad breakup. With a boyfriend we have. We had. And you're gonna roll your eyes at this but. The first day I met him I moved in with them and we ended up living together for five years, and it was just so toxic. I you know he he had a he had dissociative identity disorder, but he wasn't telling me about it, he never told me about it. So it was basically five years of me trying to figure out what the hell was going on with this kid because I could not figure it out and it was driving me crazy and and. It yeah from there, I just he he basically I basically started drinking drinking myself into an oblivion every night every single night i'm, to the point where i'm putting myself in front of them and things like that they were just like so disgusting and. He finally took be finally dropped me off with my parents and said, you know, good luck and he hasn't contacted sense so i've struggled for a little bit I ended up checking myself into detox. I did detox twice actually because I relapse after the first detox. And then from the second detox I made sure that they had an uber take me directly from the detox facility to the rehab so that I had no option to crab alcohol because i'm a little wizard when it comes to getting. The things that are not supposed to get and. So I did I did do 85 days in rehab I was excellent at it, I was lead resident. And after rehab I got back you know i'm still a now, instead of just dealing with a breakup i'm dealing with the breakup and the fact that. He never called me during rehab he never inquired as to how I was doing, and all that you know drama than even care and I just I I couldn't understand how a person to write another person off like that. Like you, like a human being, but you know with. And so, then I started wonder if I was split like if I was dissociative identity for the trauma that he calls me, you know. And i'm still trying to figure that out. I, I know that I have a very creative mind a song i'm a songwriter aspiring to be a pop artist i'm 20 years old, so it's getting kind of late, but i'm doing my best. And I have a plethora of all sorts of cartoon characters in my head that helped me out with you know, a that helped me annoy me bother me some people would call it voices in your head I i'd rather distinguish it is something more positive."
416.0,Provider,You just got muted.
12564.0,Patient,"All that kind of stuff but. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. And OCD or not a swab I was never diagnosed with OCD but I struggled with some most CDs like symptoms, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder major depressive disorder. And ADHD. And so."
416.0,Provider,And when we.
12564.0,Patient,say that one more time.
416.0,Provider,He said when were you diagnosed with those things.
12564.0,Patient,"About a year ago. In practice, when did these when did your challenges with mental health start. My challenges with mental health um. i've always struggled with OCD one high school I struggled bad with OCD and ADHD I was bullied severely for. being gay I didn't even know, I was gay, so it was just a lot of kids you know you know boiling boiling boiling boiling me and. Luckily lady gaga came out with a born this way you know theme and all of that she made gaming cool and kids stop calling me at school, so that's a fun fact. of her you know ripple effect um. I from there. It started. While I was living with my boyfriend and we were on our second year of living together and. His. And I was doing pretty well I wasn't on any medications I was going to work full time and I wasn't having panic attacks I wasn't having negative thoughts I wasn't i'm invoices and. His dad got sick from cancer and his. And we had lived together and bonded together every day for two years, like we we hadn't been separated of it at all. His dad got sick from cancer and. Suddenly he's telling me I needed to take care of my dad and you know, luckily I was working full time so I could take care of the bills anyways um. I couldn't understand because his dad also was a. was someone who had molested him when he was younger That was one thing that that I thought that I have done a lot of research on dissociative identity and I thought that that's what may have initially split up. But I couldn't understand why he would leave me and go take care of his dad because I assumed, you know as gay people when we get into relationships like that's our family, you know it's hard to explain but."
416.0,Provider,The queer Community too.
12564.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah oh awesome awesome well rupal says it better than me but. anyways so. So. So he went to visit his dad and for three months for three months until his dad died, and I did not know what to do, I I went to work, I came home, I was like rolling on the floor, I was like it. was like it was it was a weird like codependency type thing, like my primary my primary love language is touch and words of affirmation so losing that touch and it is really hard for me especially especially like right now in my life I haven't you know, had that. You know, got guys these days they just want to hook up they don't want to. They don't want to you know. show any romance or anything it's really hard to find a guy that wants to romance. I got one I got one guy that i've been chatting to he's really romantic with me says that he loves me but he's not moving here for a year, so. This is just as kind of a little struggle, he says, I can talk to other guys, but you know these guys, really, really I i'm i'm really, really like, as you can tell i'm really talkative i'm really straightforward truthful honest and. You know I I give them way too much beginning of the relationship, and I expect the same out of them, but it's like these, these guys in their early 20s you know, and I tend to go I tend to go for guys in their early 20s 1919 2021 22 like 25 because. As someone that was closeted until basically I was like 1928 my parents found out, I was outed by my uncle actually. At first I was really angry at them, then I realized he didn't you favor because there was no way I could have kept up the actor would have been extremely toxic for my mental."
416.0,Provider,Parents did your parents support you.
12564.0,Patient,"My mom. My mom initially was extremely distraught she. was primarily worried about helping me get getting her like a grandson or grandkids and so she was she had a hard time dealing with it. My dad was cool about it, you know he's more of this standoffish standoff type of dad. His father wasn't there for a much so, he tries to be there for us, I have two little brothers. and My mom and my dad have been married, for I think 30 years."
416.0,Provider,And that's who you're living with now are your brothers there too in the House.
12564.0,Patient,"yeah my brothers are there um i'm trying to build i'm trying to build better relationships with them. I just that. They kind of like to do their own thing but um. Anyhow, so he spent the three months with his father, I was going not so house and he got back and when he got back I had come up with so many things in my head like. I used to call it like detective detective Taylor because I would be like over and over analyze everything I always have I always will."
416.0,Provider,Always that's part of treatment.
12564.0,Patient,yeah yeah sorry I don't mean to be negative.
416.0,Provider,"Now yeah i'm just. i'm going to push you a little bits here and there, right. yeah something."
12564.0,Patient,"Something we can work on and so. When he got back man, he was just acting weird. When his father died, we went to the react, we went to the open casket funeral that checked me out but not check me out. And so, he finally moved back in with me to the apartment he was just acting weird so the mental. The first time I started showing signs of schizophrenia which I haven't been officially diagnosed with, but my mom has. My mom still struggles with it on daily basis, she doesn't want to take any medication for it. and social struggle, I mean I tried i'm near were there all day i'm unemployed, so I tried out for out because I have. I guess it I don't want to say a higher intelligence level but i'm younger and I know how to deal with all this in my head better than she does so i'll explain to her like. You know, like different methods and tactics that i've come up with um but anyways i'm getting off topic, it was being weird and he was staying up all night. And I was asking I was asking him why are you staying up all night, and I was going to full time work, so I was going to full time work and then I was pretending like I was sleeping at night, but I was staying up all night listening trying to listen to what he was doing. um. And I did that for like three weeks in a row, which is like insane to not sleep that long. holy crap I don't even know how I was going to work so Finally I started tripping out I checked myself into a hotel room and. I. I went to his best friend and I was telling her you know he's he's he split he's got different personalities, some of them want to hurt me. You know stuff like that, and she. You know she stuck up for me, but. Then I I went be she's like just eat you know we're going to go eat food go back and then you know go back to the House see what he does. And then I went back to the House show with him for one more day he was still acting so weird and I was still so tired. I said i'm taking a walk I went on a walk I saw a police car and I ran to the police car and I said hey I said, my boyfriend's got cameras in the walls my boyfriend's got different personalities he's trying to profit off me he's torturing me at night."
416.0,Provider,"Did you believe that, at the time."
12564.0,Patient,"I did 100% believe that especially that there were cameras in the walls. which really, really, really tripped me out, I am glad that I have. outgrew that type of nonsense, but you know it's not actually nonsense, because people do do that on this planet, which is really fucking sick. But for for my ex boyfriend to do it, you know I I don't know, he would have had to be a genius but Aside from that, the police said we think you're having a. psychotic break. And they directed me to the glendale adventist mental hospital and going to advance how me for three days in the mental Ward to let me chill out. and After that psychotic break I was never the same I just I think."
416.0,Provider,You were 2022 22.
12564.0,Patient,yeah. Maybe 2121 22.
416.0,Provider,it's all in the range of when this stuff presents.
12564.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah i've read that before as well, and so. um and, and so it it kept going on just I would watch everything he would do I would ask him question after Question after Question i've seen my mom do it, you know. i've seen my mom do it before and. We ended up moving to new Mexico together. But we were still dealing with the same problems, but now I have the problem that i'm so far away from my parents, if I want to walk away from this. I can't just walk away from it there be some have to be some kind of travel or playing involved, you know, and I didn't see how I could do that, and then I was so codependent as well, I didn't see how. I could leave them. And so it was just it was just a lot of. A lot of weird things me trying to figure it out to the point where I was putting audio audio record like iPod audio recorders around my house. to figure out what he was doing when I wasn't home, and I would get them and I was just obsessed with them, and I would listen to them like. And I heard all sorts of weird stuff like I can't even begin to explain all sorts of weird stuff that I heard it just it was just scary and so Finally we ended up moving back to California. Oh, and. To deal with listening to the audio recordings, I was drinking vodka, the whole time I was listening to them so. I wouldn't have I guess a frickin heart attack when I heard something that I didn't want to hear. You know if it would be it's kind of like. it's it gives you that you just know that fear liquid courage so. ended up telling them about the audio recordings we moved back to California, I was still drinking, he said, I could limit it to like two beers a day. He said, if I see with vodka again i'm going to bring you home to your parents, I was swinging vodka, in the middle of the night one night and he got me brought me over my parents and I was just obsessive over him just obsessive. And I think that's where the OCD comes into play. And he just kept telling me, you need to get help you need help and, finally, you know I exploded on him and he said he'd never talked to me again so that I struggle with um."
416.0,Provider,"So you've kind of grief that you're facing right now, in addition to you've been through this thing that's very, very confusing and upsetting right where you sort of get disconnected from reality."
12564.0,Patient,"disconnected to the fact, where I also believe in like aliens reptilian aliens. ufo those. Things like that you know i'll get that disconnected um."
416.0,Provider,But it doesn't sound like that comes in and goes like that's not all the time.
12564.0,Patient,"Well that's something that i've got something that i've. You know, become the master of you know i'm not going to allow myself to think like that. and You know i've got i've got bigger there's a bigger and better problems, you know I told myself. A good mantra that I tell myself, is what is one of the moon was made of cheese, you know when I start getting in now, what if what if what if what if that's a reptilian or what if that what if they exist and. One of those gang stalkers watching. i've seen i'm sure you've heard that a lot gang stalking. And so. yeah for now. For now, for my life I guess. I had a lot I built up a lot a lot a lot a lot, a lot of confidence, I built up a lot of confidence, the first time I served in jail, the three months last at the end of last year, it just sucked all the confidence that i've ever had out of my body and It made me angry and. It if. I had witness violence on a daily basis, fighting I became desensitized to violence. And it made me so angry it gave me ptsd to really bad ptsd which I haven't been diagnosed with. And that is when I started to think that I was split because um. And it was actually a bad call because I thought that I had you know I have, I have these little. Like they're like I don't like anime characters and my head like cartoons there I turned it all into a I turned it all into a mythology for the album i'm going to write the music album i'm going to write. But. Some of them even like some of them even like our characters from shows that i've watched you know or books that i've read you know things like that, and then I can emulate their personality and get through a situation so that's sort of what I did the first time. The first time I went through a jail, I was in a dorm with 140 people, I have to worse social anxiety ever I. I cannot even if i'm not on my meds I cannot even be in a room with two or more people. and So I had to deal with that and I was, I was just emulating like cartoon characters I was emulating drag Queens because they have so much confidence. You know, things like that and."
416.0,Provider,i'm like your survival instincts kick in.
12564.0,Patient,"yeah for sure. And so I got out the first time I guess I just. I guess, I was so on cloud nine that I didn't realize I didn't remember what it was like you know and so. I you know i'm i'm usually. You know I like to smoke weed when I write music i've never been into anything harder, except for you know alcohol. For some reason, after the jail thing I was getting into things like cocaine. and"
416.0,Provider,I got.
12564.0,Patient,"I got busted with the cocaine. I just I had done cocaine before and I remember how intimate It makes you emotionally, and after jail I just I felt so depleted I just. needed something to numb the pain, and so I got busted with the cup by the COPs and then. I was on grindr gay dating APP and I found it really easy to get into the methamphetamine world. Because the methamphetamine world you've got drug dealers and I had no friends, I had no boyfriend but you've got drug dealers who you can buy a. $20 bag off of and they're suddenly your best friend they're suddenly inviting you over there, suddenly inviting another cute boys over and suddenly i've got you know i've got friends i've got boyfriends i've got a sex life all over methamphetamines. My parents are X addicts of math they quickly caught on and sent me right back to jail. I dried out for another three months. I came back out of jail gotten to that regard out regarding to this program again and. This the psychiatrist and her name is Sophie of shontelle shauntel um. She prescribed me by Vance because I was taking strattera."
416.0,Provider,yeah sauna.
12564.0,Patient,"And she prescribed me via events and. I do, I have really bad panic attacks that's something that I can't fix or make go away, I have really bad panic attacks that's why I take the diazepam as well. And, of course, the other antidepressants and all that."
416.0,Provider,you're still taking seroquel or no.
12564.0,Patient,"i'm the seroquel I take as needed so like if i'm. If i'm going to bed, and the 300 milligram is a lot like guy, but I just break off a little piece of it. And yeah yeah, I guess, I would say, I take it almost every night um you know if I fall asleep without taking it that's just."
416.0,Provider,"Too you're taking her sleep them, not for the hallucinations and delusion."
12564.0,Patient,Oh no no i'm not having i'm not really having hallucinations and delusions at this point like visually or auditory.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
12564.0,Patient,"i've got a good rain and the second time in jail made me realize I don't have the ID and i'm not split because. Although I may have these alter egos or imaginary friends, whatever you want to call them, I was not able to switch into something that."
416.0,Provider,Note I don't think you have any kind of. DIY an eye. on any of them.
12564.0,Patient,"I may be able to. to emulate the. to emulate and duplicate these things from living with someone who had it. As a survival technique. But I was for being diagnosed with bipolar I do have manic phases, I have manic phases, where I can go. I can go like I can, for instance, I could stay up for three weeks without sleeping I have manic phases, where I want to go out in the middle of the night and. Be homeless for days on end without eating without sleeping the manic phases make me feel invincible. And so, and then I have the depressive faces. So basically right now I was taking something for bipolar it was giving me it was It made me gain like 100 pounds in like. Like six or seven months, so it was I was on my way to getting diabetes from taking that medication. Plus, you know the therapist I was going to was more than obviously trying to sell out medications. And so. anyways."
416.0,Provider,"To do, are you feeling like a lot more stable on the medications that you're on now."
12564.0,Patient,"yeah I yeah, the only thing i'm struggling with is depression yeah i'm not going out in the middle of the night anymore i'm not trying to sneak out. i'm you know i'm not trying to get drugs i'm not trying to drink. But the the depression is hard some days I wake up and I don't want to get out of bed sometimes i'll sleep two days in a row. And my parents i'll just be you know so upset at me but they don't understand i'm just depressed. I don't want to get out of bed I don't want to eat yeah. Something that really, really helps me is the vibe Vance. i'm a it's it I need to talk to shauntel about. something about upping it or getting an extended release or something like that, because I take it, I wake up at 8am I take it. If I take it at 8am it only lasts and i'm not sure if if it's like because of my body way because I shouldn't have a high tolerance to it, yet um."
416.0,Provider,"You need it last longer, though."
12564.0,Patient,I take the 50 milligrams and it lasts until the afternoon. crashing i'm getting really cranky i'm really depressed. So.
416.0,Provider,You have a MED follow up with chantel on the 14th.
12564.0,Patient,What.
416.0,Provider,Do you have that down the MID. 19th okay good.
12564.0,Patient,"And um. it's so I crashed in the afternoon, if I take it, when I wake up at 8am in the morning i'm i'm actually out of them right now, because my mom was giving me one one in the morning and then one in the afternoon i'm because my mom my mom is actually has on my meds and safe she keeps them. And she passes them out to me."
416.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so do you have you reached out to chantelle about you being out of meds because you can't be out of five and that's not going to feel good."
12564.0,Patient,yeah it really doesn't feel so good.
416.0,Provider,Have you been out.
12564.0,Patient,Probably four days.
416.0,Provider,"And, have you reached out to chantelle."
12564.0,Patient,um I saw her on Friday I just didn't want to bring it up in front of. The whole group.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, you can always asked to speak to her separately. Okay, and i'm going to send her a message right now hold on really quick."
12564.0,Patient,there's also one more medic okay i'll let you finish up but there's another medication i'm out of this.
416.0,Provider,One second i'll tell her.
12564.0,Patient,"she's gonna be mad at me that my mom had to double up. It was just the circumstance I I explained it to her on our last. appointment, two months ago. She got the update but. It didn't cost any longer."
416.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just gonna give her the information I don't have a medical degree so i'm just going to pass this to her and let her. nibble it so. So he's been off for four days. And what else, are you Anna."
12564.0,Patient,i'm out well. You can tell her it's in it's in my CVs it's in my CVs database. i've been out of that for about four days as well.
416.0,Provider,"If it's in your CVs database, then why don't you just go to refill."
12564.0,Patient,"um because the refill has to be approved by a doctor. The wellbutrin was prescribed by my last doctor, and so I haven't talked to Sean tell about wellbutrin yet, because I had refills from my last doctor, but they just ran out, so I I told Sean tell on Friday about my wellbutrin. But I didn't get. The end product is from another doctor so maybe she didn't see it."
416.0,Provider,"and asking if you can get an emergency appointment with her right away. Okay um. Alright, so don't suffer in the future call the virtual clinic we have a prescription line. You know, takes a while to get into it sometimes, but you can reach out to Chantal she usually gives out her email to let people contact her directly, you can let me know you can let virtual clinic know but we don't want you to suffer okay. And Okay, so we have about five minutes left and then I need to go, but I want to get make sure we get scheduled. and want to kind of reiterate what i've heard and talk about a little bit about some goals that you might have."
12564.0,Patient,"Okay, and two seconds I just wanted to let you know why I brought up the vibe and because. It just makes me feel like myself and makes me feel confident makes me feel outgoing talkative like I want to sit down to get my work done. But like i'm also not afraid to walk into a room full of people and start talking to people. it's very odd that an ADHD medication makes me like more confident and outgoing."
416.0,Provider,My my advances I believe i'm answers mood stabilizer isn't.
12564.0,Patient,"It it puts me into a happy mood, which is not something that i'm normally in So when I say crash I get real depressed like damn I have to wait until tomorrow to be happy again. You know. I don't have ADHD for only four hours a day, I have it for being tired today that's all i'm saying."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so I just heard back from chantelle you need to go straight after this to the prescription to the virtual clinic. and tell them, you have an immediate prescription issue. That you're out of medication and they can they can help you. Okay um okay. And so. Here, a lot you've been through a lot too."
12564.0,Patient,And that's that's just the tip of the iceberg.
416.0,Provider,"yeah I have a feeling there's a lot more to talk about. What i'm hearing in terms of like maybe the the most immediate stuff that needs to get worked on is first of all, you just need to participate, because of the court case. Right and you have a lot of grief about the stuff that's happened over the last few years, particularly with your former boyfriend. And you've had a break or multiple breaks from reality and. that's alarming and scary and it's adjusting to a new normal around some of that right and seeing if we can work on finding some stability for you around that. um and I right. And i'm what i'm hearing is like kind of a tendency on your part, to look for. To look for kind of kind of the term quick fix comes to mind, but that's not really accurate, but like you know. i'm going to drink, because it helps me feel better or i'm going to take some coke because it helps or i'm going to take some math because then I connect connect with these people right so it's like. yeah looking for like kind of and I don't mean to say that in any kind of judge the way it's just. So um, so I think finding some skills and some tools to have so that that isn't your go to. Be is going to be helpful, so I don't know how that sounds is that sort of like some crisis management stuff."
12564.0,Patient,"yeah, of course, no that sounds awesome."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, what and what would you add to that are there is there a particular goal, or something that you would want to add."
12564.0,Patient,"I just I. I don't like to make friends, I like to make like lovers, and I only talk to someone if there's a potential for a relationship. A lot of times that backfires in my face so maybe I need to learn how to make friends before i'm you know so smitten over I do."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and it's a great goal we can absolutely work on that so really learning how to how to approach people as friends first and take things a little slower."
12564.0,Patient,yeah taking slower.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, absolutely and. What else anything else that i'm missing."
12564.0,Patient,"not really because I mean on the addictions i'm doing really well you know. i'm not into any illegal drugs and I haven't been since I got out of jail, again I think it's carried me straight and I am. Very much over that I haven't you know gone out and looked up with anybody so i'm doing a pretty good job I just. it's just that depression, I don't know the medication taking my medication as prescribed. helps with the depression, a little bit a little bit more via Vance wouldn't wouldn't kill me that's all I.
