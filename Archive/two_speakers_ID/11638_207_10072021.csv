11638.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,I think the last time that we met you and talked about. Having issues now he he lives with his bad right.
11638.0,Patient,"Now. He moved out. I had customers have full custody of my son. My wife thing I gave them over to his dad's or. You know, do some stupid lose them. Ever gave them custom whenever the front of sport, so when all this started happening you move in with his aunt and dad sister. and Because I don't want you know i'm leave the school district is going to. Get guardianship over to it."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm. Bad mood now.
11638.0,Patient,"he's just trying to start with me. Trying to stay late oh. he's trying to use my drug addiction against me but I never really. went to any rehabs or anything like that. Where it says, I was using heroin. So. there's no proof, other than word against minds nobody's saying anything to the CPS worker is not not everybody I talked to so it's not gonna say anything about my dog. I took care of it i'm taking care of it, I never heard anybody, I know what the jail, you know it's the right thing again to his dad dragged through the mud with me so. Oh, and. i'm trying to help my dad, on the other hand, drinking problem and. never tried it out."
207.0,Provider,"So, so what is the newest because he said that your what what happened today person specifically for them."
11638.0,Patient,it's just he calls now wants to start this argument I started to call CPS and his sister and me.
207.0,Provider,He didn't mean to call CPS on you and his sister. yeah is he you know he's he's actively using now.
11638.0,Patient,"he's always drink. But. The thing is like a. He can cause, yes, I want, but. He realizes that CPS is already been talking to. His and. They called and talk to me once."
207.0,Provider,"How does a phone. Call so but Okay, so I know you said he you gave guardianship to his sister so he's he's still actively living with his sister your his his own. Okay now if he's always drinking, which puts me in the mind that he's for the most part, always intoxicated right and when you're under the influence. You. You know. you're not necessarily."

207.0,Provider,Okay.
11638.0,Patient,Here we go again.
207.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so it is one of those things where you know him trying to him being under the influence and making these threats, the threats are not necessarily validated right So if you call CPS you're only putting yourself in issues you're only. you're only looking for a restraining order to stay away right, because if CPS was supposed to follow up on. an allegation they can only invite they're going to see that she has temporary guardianship because you filed any bad temporary guardianship. And it's going to go and investigate her, and if they see that there's nothing out of what he's saying that it's a false report, it could possibly be."
11638.0,Patient,"Like two days after he moved in with us and. She. actually called CPS they've already talked to her and everything very know what's going on they're the ones that said, probably best if I did get her comfort. With illegal came up that needs to be done, I can see around she has you know she did say you know, whatever she has to get you know, whatever guardianship."

207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11638.0,Patient,"Let it, you know just. Not gonna let it ruin my life like that."
207.0,Provider,"And I like that that that that tension of strength perspective to say that i'm not going to allow. You know the scrape or whatever happened to ruin my life, but then let's put it into."
11638.0,Patient,"I was a heavy drinker. Drinking wasn't because of being right, I was already doing that. We great and I didn't start doing heroin, it was 20 years old, so no no."
207.0,Provider,"Just like situations at the situation that piled up on top of each other that's what that's called it's just like it was it started from one thing you're absolutely right. It started from one thing and then it just became the catalyst all the other things that occurred. And that loss of control that loss of confidence that that loss of you, having so low self esteem all of that just started piling up so, then the addiction, the addiction, or the dependency just became more. So you're absolutely right, the rate is not no trigger of it, but the rate didn't help the situation your independence."
11638.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,And so the who introduced you to the alcohol.
11638.0,Patient,"And the kid. Where I live, I mean I was invited to a mall my boyfriend was like his house was the party house mom will leave on the weekends so and I lived in Ann arbor I live now. What we do is we give somebody who is 21 or older mainly like. US usually a bomb, to give us. off and we give them my providers of all or. We have an older brother or sister to get for us there's always someone easily supplies."
207.0,Provider,"i'm i'm flow from so so would you say that just the idea or concept of fitting in or would you say that what settings. Yes, you were introduced, but what said, the desire for the alcohol to help to as a comfort or as a means of coke would you say your living situation living with your dad and spent more or your living situation is what just continue to. contribute to that need to continue to drink to suppress how you were feeling."
11638.0,Patient,"When you say living situation, what do you mean."
207.0,Provider,Would you say your homework with it a pleasant home I because.
11638.0,Patient,"I had a great child then like. I can't complain, but it that way, I am very grateful for what I had going up, I mean I have my mom my dad my step dad my grandma my aunt. My great grandma my grandpa my grandpa I had a bunch of people and they all got along there was no animosity with anybody um you know how they say, sometimes takes a village to raise a kid all these people have raised me mm."
207.0,Provider,hmm.
11638.0,Patient,"My family like there was no abuse of any kind. No, I mean a. I was very lucky child to have what I had growing up. very lucky. still am."
207.0,Provider,What know in school were you ever bullied.
11638.0,Patient,"No. No people a try, but I knew, because I wasn't finding what they call a kid in school and I knew that I the way I was dressing, I was gonna get. Some backlash in this way, I was living at a time it wasn't like a. country's school type saying yo and then i'm my mom. out here in Ann arbor which the bigger city. it's normal to see like got kids by all black and different color hair back in the day and I loved it I I I was where I was and I liked my own individuality and I had, I was not sorry for it and I didn't care I didn't people stop teasing you I show them, I was confident in who I was. down for very long."
207.0,Provider,"And I think it comes down to. I guess you for you, for you, identifying where the breakdown started and how it started because, yes, we can address the rate and the negative impact we can address you know all the other things um the lack of trust. In especially maybe in men, you said that yes, you had a good childhood growing up, but it still comes down to identifying. The source of when it all because you've identified that you had a great childhood, it took a village that you chimed in to assist you but. It still takes you tapping into that inner truth, so when did this all start because I could be introduced to alcohol like you said, depending on where I live, where it came from. And initially it's just like. Oh yeah it's good about like how it makes me feel because the first time that you drink alcohol what it does to you is just like I mean yeah it tastes sweet, but that I didn't know like how it made me feel or what happened, right after but then something for you. piqued your interest to continue."
11638.0,Patient,really like drinking I like the way it made me feel and. that's. that's what kept me going I just. really like and drunk.
207.0,Provider,You really liked being disconnected from the world.
11638.0,Patient,yeah I mean I I drank alcohol before or smoking pot.
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm mm hmm. To still want to still be disconnected from the world naturally to want to be disconnected It means that I want to avoid I want to hide away from the world, but why do I want to disconnect and hide away from the world and understanding them. What was it that i'm afraid of what is it that i'm afraid of experiencing who is it that caused me to be a free. Because from a natural standpoint."
11638.0,Patient,"I was afraid of growing up, and I just never want to actually grow up. getting older."
207.0,Provider,"yeah it was really scary I was so scared I grew up in a good home all right, it was a Community every everybody got along with each other, so what is it that i'm afraid of. What about adulthood. hmm."
11638.0,Patient,And a failure in life was like in on my own.
207.0,Provider,"With somebody in your life in your, whether it be family close or far that you saw. That, in your opinion, became a failure and amounted to nothing, in your opinion, because for me to be afraid of something or for me to have that thought process, I had to have seen someone go through it for me to come up with that that that thought pattern."
11638.0,Patient,"And my grandma had a gambling habit. She. Gambling addiction, she lost everything because of it. Was. All her my house Jason random hotel little motel i'm not your business businesses moto is. hard. A. family members, stop talking to her."
207.0,Provider,Were you very close to the family. your mother or your father.

11638.0,Patient,"know they were my mom hated that school I dad it's like. My dad said I needed to get away from that school district, because all they were like I was getting bad grades, and I was doing good I didn't have any friends they're. Just suck and then, when I moved in with my dad. I got good grades I got friends. I just have. My own version and. i'll call on weekends and see my mom. and Everything worked fine it was fine for three years and then I get sick of where I was at such a small minded inbred redneck piece of shit school. I can dig it. And then, like individuality, you sit through a cookie cutter mold. Oh well, you you're uh. yeah. I mean. You back raging in which. The older people in that time and suddenly kids were asked open. So I just told my mom look I can't take this stupid school anymore, so they Let me move back in with them when I was in 10th grade. I moved in with my mom. But. What it was. When I was in ninth grade. Columbine had happened, and then soon after that a bunch of schools around the time period is stupid call and bomb threat. In our school had that one and. wow wouldn't you know because there's like only five kids and the whole day of school and i'm walking along me."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11638.0,Patient,"trouble we were the first time, we were the first ones, and about the bomb threat."
207.0,Provider,um.
11638.0,Patient,got look at the most first.
207.0,Provider,Because you were because the Columbine was the thing that's what was the whole thing about the Columbine. But it sounds to me like you were bullied more than to give you acknowledge more than what knowledge.
11638.0,Patient,I don't want to get I mean I was bullied by China like. bullet a lot is just what did happen it wasn't like. I enter into danger.
207.0,Provider,"So you were bullied more than you you acknowledge and you your bullying. had an impact on is what maybe contributed to your drinking because Columbine happened, I want to say."
11638.0,Patient,In 1999 1999 I remember it clearly.
207.0,Provider,"I thought it happened wasn't cool. Okay Okay, so should happen wow oh wow I really thought that happened, while I was in school, but I remember a lot of its surrounding because then the kids that dressed in black were always targeted to. but either way if you connect the thing is, you know, even though, yes, you say when you say that you know you don't necessarily. You you when you look at how you try to move on and not have something control your life, but the truth of the matter is it's also looking at. For you at 12 years old, you think about a 12 year, even though your son is 15 but you think about a 12 year old child who grew up being raised. In for the most part of a healthy home a healthy family community and all of that, but then you drink, to the point where you wanted to disconnect from the rest of the world now granted. I remember when I was in school kids that dressed in black and all of that some of them different dabbled in certain things and things that they did. Was I would say, was out of the norm, depending on the group that you were in or were a part of but still. for you to dream, to the point where you wanted to disconnect yourself from the world. You face what you face with your home life with grandma living with grandma everybody getting displaced everything that's going on. The transition from moving out of mom and grandma auntie and moving in with that and then dealing with what you were a 12 year old kid that's a lot that's a lot for a 12 year old child."
11638.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,So.
11638.0,Patient,"When I moved. He doesn't he can't read or write, so I helped a lot of."
207.0,Provider,"there's a lot for a 12 year old child to have to deal with that is not within the norm for a 12 year old child. So the fear of me growing up the fear of me having responsibility, the fear of all of this is connected to the people around me. And the example and what I see why do I want to grow up, why do you want to have to face adulthood, why do I want because of the example that was introduced to you at a young age, so why do I want to go through them. And as other bad things started happening to you. It gave birth to new diagnosis, so your ptsd did not necessarily start from your. The infractions of the the rate it started from the humiliation of the teacher it started from you being picked out after that Columbine it started from all of these things. And all that continued so your experience was trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma as the trauma after trauma and today you're still experiencing different from us so as you work to work through one from another one happened. So your. need to isolate your needs to stay indoors it is you have learned how to hide away from the world because you don't trust the world you don't trust anyone in. you've been disappointed disappointment after disappointment after disappointment people disappoint you everyone around you disappoint you. But how can I get to a healthy place where every time I try something out. The door. Seasonal depression, probably but. Your trauma contributes to your anxiety or depression or bipolar to your mania your highs and your lows and to everything that can go on. that's the 14th."
