Because I had the prescribed by my doctor, but he, like retired, so I don't have a doctor, right now, and without. That I have I go into seizures. So she was prescribing those to me and every time she was like taking them down but it wasn't really like winning me off lakes, I thought was going on. Okay, and so like since I haven't had like I haven't had my prescription so last week I did go into a seizure. And the hospital had to go to the hospital and they gave me like out of in there to like help like give me together, the only problem is.

But like she would give me um she would say like say, like the last one, she gave me was like I believe 10 or something and. Today Okay, so today 10 that's for five days and that wasn't even completing my week before my other group, so I didn't understand why she would say today and then knowing the situation you know what i'm saying. yeah where I was she actually did."
386.0,Provider,"On 11 she sent in for two tablets my mouth once daily as the dose reduction and then she sent in a quantity of eight but that eight. Also there's a refill attached to it, so it."
13303.0,Patient,"was a four days I mean on the bottle. That they had a refill, but when I called my pharmacy and they said I had no other prescriptions there so. Okay, I didn't know what that meant."
386.0,Provider,"I can definitely verify with walgreens pharmacy for the clinic as a Pam and see what we have on file. There, because they should have something on file if you've."

386.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so when was your last dose of the canasta Pam."
13303.0,Patient,"i'm. Like bright be present to you so last week I knew I was running out, so I was literally having to break pieces off of it. Just because I like obviously didn't want to go into the. Future so last week sometime and then from there on out i've just been trying to like, for the first couple days I had two more of my seizure pills left, so I took those. Okay um and now i'm kind of just like fighting that battle like i'll have like I I know what it feels like when my seizures are coming, so I tried to just like stay up and. Like I don't know it feels like i'm on edge at all times. This is like day for I usually like it's it's never been like a week before I have them it's usually like a. few days after so like that's why I like called because, like I get insomnia, I don't sleep. beat they get loaded I literally can't fall asleep and that's like usually my first trigger of how I know what's going to happen. I did go to the er. And they gave me a dose there of my on the third day of my. seizure medicine, but they wouldn't write me another script they told me to go to my doctor, which I don't have."
386.0,Provider,No okay.
13303.0,Patient,um so it's been about four days now.
386.0,Provider,"with him and have him. Yes, thank. You for that okay. And then, for this a book how about for the suboxone the people. Nor female boxing when's the last time you use that one."
13303.0,Patient,"i'm around the same time I I knew that I wasn't like I knew I wasn't going to be able to make my meet my group, because I, my phone is off, so I only can connect with wi fi."
386.0,Provider,Okay.
13303.0,Patient,So I was literally cutting those in scripts not even able to take like a full one a day. So it was around the same time. Last week I guess you would say.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, and then."
13303.0,Patient,i'm trying my best to make. What I had last.
386.0,Provider,"Last absolutely stretching it out, I get that um I have walgreens pharmacy is the correct pharmacy for you."
13303.0,Patient,"Yes, it's the one on Monroe street and Stuart sometimes they get it confused and send it to the other one."
386.0,Provider,I have 1285 North Monroe street.
13303.0,Patient,"You, that is the correct one okay."
386.0,Provider,"i'm not going to be able to call in a script day because it's past four o'clock it's passive and we can't call prescriptions and after seven um However, what I can do is definitely you know. to let you know what we. are able to do so right now. you're currently your current group schedule is on a weekly basis and you're supposed to be. And for individual therapy and managed by an outside provider. But from what I understand is a. you're not actually being seen are managed by an outside physician and no longer Is that correct."
13303.0,Patient,i'm not like my doctor.
386.0,Provider,"It just has current individual therapy appointment frequency is managed by outside providers, so do you have like a psychiatrist outside of ah ah."
13303.0,Patient,"I did have a psychiatrist that I wasn't seeing but I haven't spoke with her in a while, because of like the phone situation. I mean, I guess, no to that and."
386.0,Provider,"that's Okay, and so what I see here is that you've missed quite a few appointments in the last like month I have no shows on 1130 1124 and then you had shown up on 1123 when the last script was sent in but prior to that 1029 and 1027 so yeah and then."
13303.0,Patient,What else I know that is a problem.
386.0,Provider,"yeah, and so the bps evaluation, you have scheduled on 1213. And you have group again on a 1214 and do you think you're going to be able to make those appointments."
13303.0,Patient,yeah I I told the guys that I spoke to I will make sure that I do my one on one I didn't even know I had to do those but he told me that I did. I told him I will make sure I will do my one on one and then my group i'm i'm going to be somewhere where I am going to be having access so that won't be a problem.
386.0,Provider,"So, right now, as we speak, where we're at in in frequency of care and with the amount of no shows that have. that have happened it's 12 plus no shows and at at that 12 plus no show what they do is that the computer automatically generates a possibility for the provider to review that there is a possibility there's a discharge for higher level of care needed due to just non compliance. And so. At that moment time what they usually. do is say move your current group. Appointment frequency for a weekly three times a week. With you not having. You know, Internet connection, which is a huge requirement on you know. Important part of. telemedicine, and so."
13303.0,Patient,"What i'm starting next week, I will. I will be in a different like a different place where I will have full access that's how I was saying, I will, I know i'll be able to make the group and the one on one."
386.0,Provider,"You got it and then your urine drug screening i'm it looks doesn't look like we've received like a urine drug test from you, through bh ah. Have you did you realize that cut back in August."
13303.0,Patient,"um I don't remember receiving it, but the the guy told me I could go to a quest or a facility that does that and they could provide it. yep questions thing and I just have to get the fax number."
386.0,Provider,"yep so as long as you get that fax number, we can get an order sent over to whatever facility, you get go that you're wanting to go to for us to be able to get that up to date okay. That that would show a lot of commitment on your end in terms of making sure that your prescriptions wouldn't be altered as we speak, right now, because of those no shows, and because of that urine drug screening in your individual therapy. The previous evaluation hasn't been completed yet. And the container automatically generated. For your prescription recommendation to be a two day supply without any additional. refills that's not going to get you very far and so what I can do is I can send a message over to Julie kane to see if i'd be able to do a four day supply with one additional refill or two days supply with three additional refills to get you over to your next appointment. For. For your next group appointment for her to kind of just take over and do like a whole evaluation again and see what we can do, moving forward and getting you back on track. Okay, I cannot stress enough how important these appointments are because the only time we've typically discharged patients is when they don't come."
13303.0,Patient,"to grow. yeah and I actually like I I, like my group and stuff so like I don't like miss it intentionally it's just like it's like I have a situation I can't really control, so I only can do so much in with that situation."
386.0,Provider,Understandable um so i'm gonna i'm just what i'm going to do.
13303.0,Patient,You don't have a callback number.

Today, with multiple refills to get you taken care of that way you're not without medication at all, have you relapse using any opioids or any other illicit substances, since last time she seen you. relapse and are you currently experiencing any type of withdrawals at the moment."
13303.0,Patient,"um no, not that I I don't think so."
386.0,Provider,Just a little bit on edge.
13303.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't want to go into that next step of the like actually relaxing and or my health of like this user situation or that's, the only thing that's like a model like anxiety I guess you would say."
