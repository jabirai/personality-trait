6542.0,Patient,Other appointment is on October 1.
165.0,Provider,"And that's where individual therapy okay i'm. Okay, so. So you are also you are also on the list for the Monday care group. So if you're able to I would go to that i'm not going to require it, because there's a prescription over right in here. From your prescriber just only, but only until the first of October so just so you know that's. You know about to go away. Obviously, if you are still having struggles they're going to make sure that you're taking care of I just. Just a heads up."
6542.0,Patient,If you're. Totally.
165.0,Provider,"No, no, so like so instead of very short read like a very short day supply with additional refills it will you know, like we're just. She noted that you are having a difficulty with housing, right now, and so that, and so, because of that we're being a little bit more lenient we will always medicaid our patients as long as we see them, so you make sure you come and show up. You know what I mean. But, but no she just right now, you have an override for that recommendation of like the two or four day supply so i'm going to call on a five day supply of suboxone for you to walgreens. i'm just typing I might even talk to myself. But yeah so anyways but that override it ends on October 1 just just so you know and. Like I said, if you're still struggling. All you need to do is talk to her about that, but you have to go to your appointments in order to have that happen, you know. And also just to you know I did try to let you in here, I had you in the room, and I even sent you a message, it would have been at 1222 to 1227 and I even send the message and I was like hey can I help you so you must been doing something else on your phone, I just want to let you know. Well, and new I guess the only reason I really even mentioned that justin is because if you go to your group, then you don't have to come here and, like you know what I mean like we're not like the hassle would. That household would not be there. You muted yourself I don't know if you did that on purpose or not, but. I always do that and then talk to myself and then feel stupid later so so like I said i'm going to call on a five day supply for you when is your group on what time is. just looking to see okay yeah so five days should be let me double check the calendar that's today Saturday Sunday Monday. Tuesday yeah so you'll have medication from today, and through the end of Tuesday and then you'll get a new script on that Tuesday group okay. And then, if you want to just hang out with me here, while I call that in i'll just connect from audio and then. And then buzz back when i'm done. I mean, do you need to go, I mean you're welcome to go if you need to, but this way I can tell you in real time that it's done."
6542.0,Patient,No just wait.
165.0,Provider,"Okay alrighty i'm going to disconnect from audio now and give them a call Thank you. alrighty are you still there with me. yeah Okay, I was able to call that in I talked to pharmacist ready or add why. And so, if you need anything else, but I think you should be good to go is there anything else that I can help you with."
6542.0,Patient,yeah Thank you.
165.0,Provider,Okay nice to see you.
6542.0,Patient,You too.
