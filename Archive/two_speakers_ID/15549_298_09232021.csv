It just got worse and worse and worse and so i'm yeah. i'm dealing with panic attacks and just my anxiety is just always it's always highs like i'm dealing with it every day, as opposed to. Do would be here and there, and it's just it just gets worse as time goes on, and I think it's due to not working and being out doing what i'm normally used to doing you know. And so. yeah I was I had xanax I was taking xanax I was able to take it without having to go to the doctor which. My mom my mom also deals with this we have anxiety, so my doctor now won't give it to me my regular physician so now I get to go to uni know how it is they're making you jump through hoops to get certain prescriptions so here I am."

298.0,Provider,"Okay here here's where i've had no success like zero success. Is anytime that I take on a patient who gets xanax from the street and I tried to put them on something else, or I try to give them a little bit.
