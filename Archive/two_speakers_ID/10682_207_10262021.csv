We gotta get it done if if you know we're being paid for the job from my mother in law, she technically owns the House but um you know, like she's paying for my my tires that she paid for brand new tires on my jeep so it can't be that and.

207.0,Provider,"So, so how was everything with your mother in law."
10682.0,Patient,"it's going okay I. can't remember I don't think I had talked to yet, but I snapped at her like pretty bad because. She keeps talking about she needs this House done she needs it done blah blah blah the girl wants to move then okay well I work a job. I have a baby and you went on your 50th looking vacation this year, so it must not be that important to you, and you know that I can't have my daughter around the page and i'm going to need somebody to babysit her and so just kind of snapped because. Well, about a bunch of stuff so I ended up going to um I ended up going to. Which my call it my hairdresser my cousin she's my hairdresser and I ended up getting it done it took forever I don't know why she takes forever, but she did a really, really good job and then I um. I ended up going back to the House, I ended up leaving work early and everything and I ended up i'm. Basically, getting my hair done the leaving their CD sorry i'm like losing my train of thought, like add or something, but I ended up i'm. sandy messaged me at seven o'clock okay Just to give you an idea I went to the hairdresser at two o'clock I had to have Genevieve on my lap for two hours. at seven o'clock I said Oh, she should be done soon this part it's still kind of like yucky like an ugly nasty yellow but she ended up doing my hair incorrectly. And I was there for about nine hours total so I then from there, she ended up redoing it a little bit, but sandy had said, can you put Nana on the toilet for me so i'm like Okay, we should be done at one o'clock or i'm sorry eight o'clock and she ended up. Having or lay in bed she told me to take my time so I didn't bother rushing or messaging her when it came nine o'clock so I ended up. message in her finally saying hey sorry, you know my hair came out kind of messed up in the front, she had to redo it was literally orange all this section was orange and I wasn't about to leave their like that so then. She ended up but redoing I got out maybe quarter to 10 and I come back to nana's, mind you, my dog hasn't been let out i'm like 12 hours so i'm like Okay, and I told her, I expressed her in text I need to go do that ASAP. will tell me why she asked me to can you put me in on the toilet i'm like that was 75 you haven't. nana's embed it's 10 o'clock at night, like you, didn't put it on the toilet before then. Well, no, so and so at four o'clock put her on the toilet and that other that I said why really needs to go and she's like well she's, what can you just change her and bad. And I just kind of split and I was like fine i'll fucking do, and I can do everything like I just snapped like my God I haven't I didn't eat that whole day because I was at the. hair salon and then I had my daughter, and it was just like a million things going on it's just like. you're super inconsiderate like I appreciate you watching my daughter for four hours, but my God like if it was anybody else watching her mom and her mom was what should we want to get cussed out."
207.0,Provider,"Do you think that there's a part of her that's kind of a fleet. cold you like the way she deals with him now, and he is not physically there like she's having some of the same expectations of you."
10682.0,Patient,"I mean, I guess yeah yes, I know, like i'm always trying to fill in and help because she does help me to a certain degree, but it's just like Jesus Christ like you know that i'm starving I haven't eat and. i've been gone for all day I had last time I was home was at 9am 8:30am and I haven't even fed my dog or let them out to go potty and, like this one simple thing just fucking do it that's how I feel. I didn't say sorry to her, she didn't say anything but the next day that's when she. said that she would pay for my tires. So."
207.0,Provider,"I said Okay, are you will say no."
10682.0,Patient,No. hold on it's hard to shit.
207.0,Provider,"Oh, like Okay, so you you flip the script on the phone came out of that term you use."
10682.0,Patient,"On yesterday yeah the hood came out of me a little bit I got a little crazy and then I settled down, and it was kind of funny because she was still trying to maintain her composure in front of Genevieve and like. She was just like oh Okay, which, which is a good thing, yes i'm not saying it's a bad thing, but I just was like I had it enough."
207.0,Provider,How are you managing your time and your availability and just your own overall self care I.
10682.0,Patient,"feel like of course i'm lacking in my self care area just because i'm just doing a million things right now, but I feel like. i'm checking off things off my list like I finally found somebody to do my rough at my house which that was like a huge stress reliever. um I just ordered all the shingles got it all delivered and stuff and then I have to order the last minute stuff tonight, but like. So basically what i'm saying i'm checking things off big major things that have to be done i'm slowly checking them off the list, as well as trying to maintain. You know and and grow my business that i'm the manager and trying to I don't know, sometimes I just want to break, but even on the weekends I don't get to sleep in I don't get that break, because I have my daughter, and she wakes up she's on like the schedule, you know."
207.0,Provider,"And, and I think that, ultimately, it becomes important to manage, even when you have enough to say that you're. Having to set those boundaries or say what you have to say to your mother in law wasn't necessary but sometimes you have to manage and identify, whereas a lot of that passion coming from could that passion you're muted."
10682.0,Patient,"Sorry, I was trying to wait for us to saw dust off my phone."
207.0,Provider,"No problem if you have to look at some of that passion and the aggravation is it coming from. You know, because you have so much to do, you have this big to do list and you're working through them. While being genovese mom and trying to hold down the fort because of because of this accident individual sometimes you have to do sometimes check in to say hey you know, I am sorry for the way I blew up because I was. overwhelmed and I felt. For that moment abandoned, but also, I hear you speak a lot about her, and even though you both are helping each other how much is your mom and your family involved in helping you."
10682.0,Patient,"Oh, my mom has like a jealousy thing against sandy which I understand, of course, but. She has a hard time facing the music that you know sandy's been here to help me she's been accommodating and then I told you that last time they were arguing about how. You know it's not convenient for them for me to go someplace and they want me to take her here to meet them here, and it was just too much, I was like dude. What about me I thought this was going to be convenient for me and to you know, and my mom said that's not enough time with my granddaughter I said anytime should be good, so my mom's kind of back down on that you know stance in she um. She actually watched Genevieve yesterday with my sister and my sister were kind of like at odds with each other she's a super super stuck up bitch. And she does know run again I don't know she's just super petty and bitchy and she thinks she's better than everybody and so. I wasn't sure how that was going to go, but my mom runs to her beck and call, because I think my mom just has to feel needed so like i'm in the process right now of trying to work out a schedule for her and Genevieve and everybody to be happy to spend time with each other, and you know. it's a work in progress."
207.0,Provider,yeah and um so when is when is Cole coming home is he he's.
10682.0,Patient,"going to be late on oh yeah. he's supposed to go see the board the parole board in December, but with him being a parole violator that is a good thing on his side because they might say. You don't shoot come on decline that call they might say i'm you know. You can go home and 90 days here you go you don't even have to see the board bye bye so it just varies, you know, right now, every October it's a new year for the Department of corrections and that's kind of how they go off oh."
207.0,Provider,i'm happy you speak to him a lot like How often do you see him.
10682.0,Patient,"um so sandy since I have a criminal background, I cannot visit him but sandy can she's the one who has the the visitation form i'm almost positive unless she has to. fill it out again, but I got denied immediately, so we can do like video visits i'm almost positive that her thing is good, but then i'm the. I get to talk to him every single day."
207.0,Provider,i'm.
10682.0,Patient,Adrian which I think it's like an hour away or something but.
207.0,Provider,"She ever bring the baby, are you won't allow it."
10682.0,Patient,"Oh i'm bringing my baby and they're like no, we can do, video visits. know. We can do video visits so."
207.0,Provider,He does it so we just get to see her.
10682.0,Patient,um he we haven't done a video visit as of yet.
207.0,Provider,Okay okay.
10682.0,Patient,"So i'm just waiting pretty much right now for sandy sandy has been kind of all over the place, which is the mother in law, she literally has been a fucking circus. um you know she we went to court for one of the tenants a girl odd and died and in one of our houses, one of the rental properties right down the street from here. And so we had to evict him. He has not paid rent in nine months, and they have I don't know if they have it down in Florida, but it's called the Sarah program have you heard of that. it's a government funded program and it's to help with landlords and tenants that are. In a rear edge of rent so they'll pay like they paid a bunch of money for him to be there for like I think 10 months or something well on his end she was supposed to provide $215 every month. Well, he hasn't paid shit it's all we have to take them to court and everything so like I get she's all over the place she's trying, but you shouldn't be going on vacation. that's what I don't get."
207.0,Provider,"What well, I mean, is it that she's going on vacation every month every month every."
10682.0,Patient,girl she goes up North and on her vacation what whether they're like mini vacation she goes up there all the time. This is like it's a non stop saying.
207.0,Provider,Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you went on vacation.
10682.0,Patient,"shane. Boyne mountain, I think, was the last time, which was in like June or July, or something. i'm just like."
207.0,Provider,This year.
10682.0,Patient,i'm sorry say it again.
207.0,Provider,It was June and July of this year right.
10682.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah we went up North and it was super super Nice and it's like the mountains and stuff it's a boy in mountain or whatever and. It is nice I think it's beautiful but um. You know I don't get to go on vacation like that number one I got that job position and I can't just up and leave without coverage, making sure everything squared away, but also to like. nano watching me Anna has definitely made me feel like you know I need her right now so i'm kind of happy she is alive. Because I seriously would not be able to make it off just my income, I have to pay the taxes, this year for the House, I have to have to get new tires I have to pay my car payment my car insurance and everything for Genevieve new clothes like she's growing like a weed."
207.0,Provider,hmm. So hurricane sandy pain you watch Nana has been a big help.
10682.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely yes, it has been an extremely huge help, so I mean me me being able to just be there and watch her. and have all this free untaxed money has been a blessing because it's helped me pay for so much stuff like I don't know what I would have done Rochelle like I seriously don't I would have been screwed. Without paul's income and his help I would have been. screwed over."
207.0,Provider,"So so okay so it's definitely been a big help for you, but then you also said that sandy outside of her paying you to watch Nana it sounds like she's also helping you with other things to her just tired."
10682.0,Patient,"She picks and chooses what she wants to help with. let's be real she. picks and chooses and that's an issue with me because I try to help as much as possible. But it's it's a pain in my ass. Because, because I really do go above and beyond Okay, for instance, one of these days I ended up going into work late, just so that I could go take paint to this other rental property to this guy named Danny and he. I was late because he's such an idiot he could even go to home depot and get the right fit and paint it just. drives me NUTS so me being me i'm like Oh well, work is about 10 minutes away i'll take off work a little bit or i'll go in late and i'll go do this and I don't think she really counts, all that stuff sometimes like it's aggravating to me super aggravating. So I feel like sometimes I give too much."
207.0,Provider,So maybe it's reevaluating how much you're dedicating your time. To what you're doing like what what makes you what. Why do you do offer so much of your time and service.
10682.0,Patient,"I guess you know, for instance, this House I initially agreed to do this House on the strength of my friend chevelle. she's an older woman she's like in her 50s early 50s and we she was my old neighbor before I moved out to my house and she's became a really, really good dear friend well. Her husband is the provider and he works. She hasn't worked for a while she has disability or she's been trying to get disability, but she's so young, that you know they automatically deny you well, whatever. So she wanted some money, so I said Okay, well, we could go paint this House i'll help you with it, but if you clean it up you'll get all the money for cleaning it and then i'll help you paint we can split the painting stuff. So that was my purpose of doing this, for instance, that that's just an instance there's always a reason to it, or I just feel like Maybe I should help out oh Why could do that here i'm just i'm a giver I don't I don't know I like to make people happy and proud and not you know. mm hmm I don't know, maybe i'm start seeking reassurance I don't know."
207.0,Provider,I need and why do you feel like you're seeking reassuring that. Something you've left over the years.
10682.0,Patient,"Well, I guess, maybe it's because I look at her as like my mother and. She has been like a really, really, really big help throughout me being pregnant, I mean she was there when I gave birth to Genevieve and I don't know, maybe, deep down i'm doing stuff to seek approval without me even realizing it. I don't know I just fit i'm."
207.0,Provider,Good. was your mom was your did your mom was lacking in those areas.
10682.0,Patient,"Oh 100% my mom is all about my mom she always has been. Mike my aunt which is my mother's sister she raised my sister and I she had custody and my mom. would definitely pick men and partying and all that type of bs over being a mother like we I was talking to chevelle about it, the other day about how. I would, we would sit at the big window and my mom would say okay i'm going to walk right up to the store the store is a block away and you could see the store from our House. And there's a bar right across the street, and she would walk to the store and then she'd go to the bar and I remember my we would have my sister she was eight years old she'd have to go down to the bar and get her to come on."
207.0,Provider,"Because it sounds like even though you, you have this. The relationship like where you know every now and again, you kind of sniper who get upset with me, it seems like you have a much closer relationship with sandy like if I didn't know any better I would think that that's your mom."
10682.0,Patient,yeah I do feel like that I do.
207.0,Provider,Like you said it is she gives you and she shows you more time and attention and you everything that she's giving you started out from your mom and because you don't get it you're more willing to go above and beyond for sandy she's more like a daughter.
10682.0,Patient,"Yes, and even with my mom you know I went as far as buying her a car, I mean she paid me back the majority of it, but like yeah I put out a couple thousand for her to get a car and. You know I even have her car registered to me and it's under my insurance, and you know, I guess, I put myself out there way too much for just anybody in general."
207.0,Provider,"But, but it sometimes you think about the reason why you gravitate to one. family or you stay where you are it's because there is a void within you that you're seeking to get filled and so right now sandy is filling it in and i'm sure you're there you have your moments, where you reach out to get it from your mom and there's been a disappointment."
10682.0,Patient,yeah I think there's a ghost engineer because somebody just turned on this radio all by itself.
207.0,Provider,"No one none that you just said that. You, as you as the face that you had just now, I was watching these things on on instagram and it shows the people like you're in you're in the House by themselves and they hear the noise and they just stopped and looking like."
10682.0,Patient,Go yeah I was like what i'm like halfway across. The room and it turns on out of nowhere i'm like what. Is it one of the wall radios. um no it's like a it's like an old school clock radio. But you have to literally push that thing over and i'm like Jesus. yeah i'm not scared though but it's kind of we're.
207.0,Provider,Not all have you ever like had a heart to heart with your mom to let her know how you feel and why. Her feeling of jealousy i'm short is legitimate legitimate simply because she probably feels that you invest more of your time and energy and everything with Genevieve sandy Have you ever really talked to her.
10682.0,Patient,"Well we're actually. We set up a time to talk this week because she kind of went a little crazy on me and she was being like super mean and she started talking about. I guess my friendship was chevelle and she thinks it's weird and I said well why she's like because she's almost my age, she was just. She gets in these moods and she tries to like hurt me and bring me down and um. I had said why I think it's kind of funny that you are talking to this guy who's around my age who I used to be in drug rehab classes with. Like she she told me about this guy who she met up with, and they got freaky whatever and I was like oh what's his name and she showed me a picture i'm like Oh, I was in rehab classes with him like six years ago. And she kind of then she threw it back in my face and she's like oh don't get me started on age. And she started bringing up my past about me having this really old sugar Daddy that would like he really took care of me was a good guy. But he was super old, and that was during my addiction, but it was like what I don't get it you through the jab at me first like she just she's very hateful she has a lot of emotional issues I don't know if she's bipolar or what something mentally wrong."
207.0,Provider,"Which equals, for her mother."
10682.0,Patient,"um yeah my grandma was an enabler though my grandma gave my mom practically whatever she wanted, and you know bet bailed out of jail all the time and."
207.0,Provider,he's super cool does your mom have been.
10682.0,Patient,issue what.
207.0,Provider,Does she have sibling.
10682.0,Patient,"Yes, my mother does yes."
207.0,Provider,"Because the way you just described, your mom is as if your mom has not differentiated between that your relationship she's mommy and your daughter, the way you talk about your mom and dad your mom see you effort equal."
10682.0,Patient,"yeah that's how I feel a lot. She doesn't care what she says to me, she doesn't care how I feel about a lot of stuff but she's definitely scared if my sister finds out about something, because then she'll judge her and i'm like what well, what about me like."
207.0,Provider,You don't care what I am your friend. yeah how much older sister.
10682.0,Patient,Just two years older than me.
207.0,Provider,Is your sister a little bit more stern or more of the no nonsense in some sense in comparison to you.
10682.0,Patient,"Yes, where we i'm more of like a down to earth person she's more of a stuck up knows in the clouds doesn't you know show Rachel off in the second regardless of if your family to me I I value my family, so I feel like loyalty is everything."
207.0,Provider,So regardless of your sister.
10682.0,Patient,She fears yeah she is it.
207.0,Provider,"But because you're more down to earth she um she fears your sister she sees you as her equal she grew up being somewhat as a little princess. One that never had to take responsibility for herself your sister does not condone that and so, therefore, not to say that you condone that but you kind of just like hey."
10682.0,Patient,Everyone i'm i'm more accepting of her behavior.
207.0,Provider,"Is it that you're accepting or you just say hey you do whatever you want to do you do today, you do your what have you but because you value family a little bit more you're you're a lot more tolerant than your sister."
10682.0,Patient,"I mean, I feel like that statement is true um and maybe it's because my mom feels like I she can relate to me more because she's been in trouble with the law she's had problems with drugs and everything but."
207.0,Provider,yeah I don't have never had any now she has a problem was spending.
10682.0,Patient,"She spends way too much money and that's Another thing I feel like me and my sister kind of that adds with each other, because I bought a house I. With my partner or whatever we bought a house and you know, I have a nice vehicle, even though it's a lease, but I feel more stable in that aspect she's renting still she's been renting she throws away like 20 $500 a month in rent."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, it says Okay, this is the thing and sometimes if we kept it we we justify things we add new meaning Okay, you may have been an addict to some form of chemical substance right. Right you over here spending your money like there's no tomorrow that doesn't mean that you're not an addict is like a gambler Oh well, i'm a gambler honey i'm not a mid. brain. We both got to go to anonymous it doesn't matter, why we go into the mountains what we both went on this we both. deal with our issues in different ways, just because I don't choose to drink it away. You choose to spend it away at the end of the day we both have the same upbringing, we both had the same mother who struggles with her own things just because we went in different direction doesn't mean that we find different ways to cope with our past. And so it doesn't make me any better any any different from you or i'm no better than you but we justify certain things in our mind and so. Though your mother feels like Okay, well, I had my vows of addiction, and so I may relate to you more know all three of you can relate to each other, is how."
10682.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,"All three of you relate to each other, because the same mom raise both of you. The same mom left both of you alone and says look through a mirror and watch me go to the store and both of you watched her go to the store then go through before Nancy this person and do the same, you both of you saw the same thing. Right, how you dealt with it it's just different."
10682.0,Patient,"yeah you know I may have dabbled in drugs and everything and she's done her fair share of you know, whether it be. overspending shopping addiction, whatever and you know, but the thing with her why we are so different I used to make up a lot of excuses for her and i'd say oh that's just leticia that's just how she is. No i'm done you either have respect for somebody or you don't like enough is enough i'm not going to coddle like my mom does, I feel like my mom cottle's and like conforms to what she thinks my sister wants or. You know what she represents To me, this is me i'm an individual i'm different from you, you may be my sibling However I deserve respect to so no, you cannot talk to me that way, no, you cannot try to order me around and tell me what to do with my kid."
207.0,Provider,"And do you think that your mother fears saying that to her, she doesn't say the same thing to her, because she feared cutting her off completely."
10682.0,Patient,"Yes, I am she's always been like closer to my sister, you know, like growing up even she's always been my sisters. and It which is okay I don't care because I have my grandparents and stuff but like i've always felt like they've had a completely different bond than what she does to me and. My mom makes up excuses for her and to me that's why we're so distant now is because i'm not gonna i'm a grown ass woman you're not going to tell me what to do, and she would like. Start shit with me because I wouldn't allow her to boss me around on how to take care of my kid when I first had a."
207.0,Provider,single marissa I believe that you have a strong personality. How much stronger your personality than yours.
10682.0,Patient,"Oh, she I mean she's a total bit she's got a very strong personality and the thing is it's a shame."
207.0,Provider,"What she said, you are to which you."
10682.0,Patient,"know I think she would say that i'm careless and i'm not organized and I need to schedule and she thinks i'm just totally unorganized and i'm just whatever. Which is okay with me i'd rather be you know, the way that I am I do a million things already as it is, but i'm not going to sit there, and you know act like I have just this my mom made a comment and said. Maybe you should tell leticia my sister we're colas then maybe your guys's relationship, maybe, she would feel the need to talk to you more than. What does she said no, she. She."
207.0,Provider,wants to talk to you.
10682.0,Patient,"Exactly that's what I said I said no ma'am that's not going to make a difference if she wants to talk to me, she will, at the end of the day. she's my sister the conversation left off with her and if she wants to have a relationship with me or her niece. Then she will do so i've went out of my way multiple times and that's where I say she makes up excuses for my sister she calls her and makes up all these excuses of why she can't do blah blah blah blah blah. But I should be going out of my way 50 million times out of the day, to have a relationship."
207.0,Provider,"And I say no you're fine hearted. Because because it's the way you again, it goes back way you keep family and the way she like you said you describe your sister. She has she makes no nevermind about cutting you long, where is it for you it's not the same now is it just the three of you. Just your mom yes so and in your dad and mom in the picture has never been in a literary festival and."
10682.0,Patient,"That really he's in prison for. For life for murder down in Florida actually where you're at well not in Miami or and thank you, and he got arrested in 2012 and I think it was land O lakes, or something as by Tampa and all that."
207.0,Provider,"yeah remember later, but you're going on."
10682.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"very, very hometown before but."
10682.0,Patient,yeah between new port Richey in there.
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so either way it's just the three of you and. i'm sure like you said, both of you have a strong personality, the way to display, it is very different and i'm sure the same way you describe her, she will probably describe you in the same way, but just a different way of describing. The thing is, your mom is afraid of losing her you have never given her a part of. You have never given her a reason to be afraid of losing the relationship, but your sister give her that reason of of losing the relationship so that's the reason why."
10682.0,Patient,"it's so ridiculous it's like what I just don't feel like I need to prove myself that I need to go out of my way a million times for somebody who should be involved in my life, like my sister Just to give you a background my cousin who We grew up with who is pretty much my sister. We all grew up together she's the same age as my sister and my cousin was going through a divorce, she was clinically diagnosed with bipolar and depression and she was going to kill herself. um I ended up not going on my friends bow one a couple for this weekend and I went to her house to help clean up because she got admitted to the hospital, you know she's going through she was going through a breakdown and my sister. She didn't have any sympathy for her, she didn't care she just that she's disgusting i'm like are you fucking kidding me do it that's like our sister We grew up with her that's family. that's just the type of person she is in G sided with my cousins ex husband and like would prefer to be friends with him versus her own family it's pretty sad."
207.0,Provider,"She has no lawyers and he yet. But you know what. Your sister your sister, and she has to come to that place of saying hey you know what family is important, and I want a relationship and she has to work through certain things. I think it's just at this point it's more important for us to really have that conversation with a heart to heart with your mom. And if she is jealous of the relationship between you and sandy it's letting her know hey you know what because sandy. treats me like a daughter, and then this is the manner in which a tree, something that I see from you, but you're so busy trying to be my friend that you're not recognizing I need my mother. Right and it's not that you're you're minimizing the friendship relationship you guys have, however, is not a healthy friendship relationship, because you forgot that you're my mother and I need my mother. But I need my mother, and so this is the reason why sandy fills that gap and that's the reason why i'm more drawn to sandy."
10682.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,"And so, in conversation with her and letting her know how you feel and it's not you know, at the end of the day, you know, whatever is going on between you and your sister that's something that both of you have to work out but enabling her behavior or making excuses for her it's. not helping the situation, because then for you. It just makes you more resentful toward your sister and even her because of the fact that she keeps making excuses for her behavior."
10682.0,Patient,"No, I agree 100% and and I can't wait to even express her exactly and reiterate that what we just talked about her he's That is exactly how I feel."
207.0,Provider,i'm not going to enable leticia to feel like she can have power over me and.
10682.0,Patient,Treating anybody just any kind of way.
207.0,Provider,"of expressing that film, because the more you make excuses for her The more I feel more resentful because then she feel it's almost like you're empowering her. To to continue to do what or if he even right that she's doing what she's doing and it's like you're not going to allow that anymore you're both two different individuals you both grew up with the same mother and have the same experiences both of you have the same BAT right."
10682.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
207.0,Provider,"Both of you to foster dad whatever. occurred. So you both have the same experience how you choose to deal with and and cope with it and, just like you said, but it me making her aware that my partner is incarcerated that's not I don't need that type of. Sympathy I don't need that level of empathy I just need you to be. Whether he is incarcerated for he is at home doesn't it shouldn't change the relationship in our dynamic I shouldn't. affect anything you should just want to be my sister, though, we have our different personalities, but that is something that both of you need to work on. She doesn't need to get into because it's almost as if she has like that friend in the middle that's trying to say hey let's all come together and let's go do no. No, you should. You should be. Both of us not not mom to one in a frame for the other."
10682.0,Patient,"Exactly oh my God it frustrates me so bad, but that's the perfect way to say it, though you she does treat you like, a friend and her daughter, and she treats my sister like that you know her kid I just feel like an outsider with the two of them, I feel like they gang up on me a lot."
207.0,Provider,"And it's letting her know that it's letting her know that so when you find yourself being defensive or snapping either one of them. is letting her know that i'm speaking from a place of years of frustration built up anger or resentment because of how you are or you're being seen so you know it's wild sandy is probably naturally being who she is to you because that's just sandy. But at the same time. i'm getting from what I would desire from you. So and that's just kind of and you're not trying to keep her away from arm your daughter, but at the same time is Cindy is going to be a grandmother her granddaughter and not try to me because, then this is the other thing that your mom could end up trying to do. is sometimes some parents, they try to live vicariously through the grandchild."
10682.0,Patient,Because she's.
207.0,Provider,Not a mom to you now she all of a sudden want your mom to your daughter.

10682.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, I really hope, like patience is definitely a virtue and i'm working on it, but my God, I sometimes I just want to jump out of my skin like."
207.0,Provider,"What it's being it's being open all you can this is all you can do, Melissa let her know how you feel share with her how you feel and leave it, because then, if you then start backing away you can't she can't then say you never verbalized how you never communicated how you feel. it's not saying all of a sudden, you just decide to go, you know go. invisible."
10682.0,Patient,"Well, this isn't new though Russia we've had multiple conversations about this multiple."
207.0,Provider,And I believe you will.
10682.0,Patient,She treats me differently and i've said that from the very beginning.
207.0,Provider,"But then you would have to put the boundaries there just the same way you put boundaries with coal or but with with with sandy or with your sister it's a thing, where you're gonna have to do it with your mom. Because you're going to then get frustrated because you feel like you're you're a broken record towards her so you would have to say hey This is where i'm ending it it's either you work you if you need therapy for yourself and from your past and you need to do what you gotta do. And so i'm not gonna. i'm not going to be your mom and i'm not one to attempt to be your mom I need you to be my mom I need you to be Genevieve grandmother."
