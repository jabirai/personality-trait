Let me. or warn you. i'm going to Okay, so let me kind of back up for a second, so this is kind of the way that this works, so you had. to know show appointments with your therapist so it kind of puts you in like a compliance red zone any it has nothing to do with you specifically anytime you're on stimulant up therapy you're required to. Do frequent presentation in order to make sure that the stimulants aren't causing you any disdain or any discomfort or any dishonor and so. When you go into like a red zone of like quote unquote program on compliance, then I have to stagger you back into. Like full prescription so program requires that i've prescribe it in like increments of four days. And i'm going to submit it for like four days, plus one refill just to see if that goes through, because I know that this is the medication that you're comfortable with is not providing you with any issues. And then, when you first presented to they're wanting to groups in order for you to like join to see me frequently so that you wouldn't have to worry about these individual appointments so. i'm going to put it in for that if there's any issue with filling it in our know first and then i'll send you i'll send you an email so you're aware of it, but I also admitted only double check make sure that I have your correct email. madeline.edu at gmail COM. yeah okay.

All also let me make sure that I can help. alleviate any of this to see. If you receive any surveys to complete with regard to how you're feeling with regard to attention and focus and concentration, it should be an electronic link. Make sure that you complete those and then. there's also urine drug screen, you had labs completed in at the end of September yeah. i'll set you. up for an updated urine sample to be complete anytime in the next two weeks or so if that's not convenient for you, but the care navigator know so that they can push it out some. Other than that, this is all kind of a ways to put you back into like overall program compliance, so I can go back to like two weeks, and then 30 day supply so that, at that point, you can just checking in with me, let me know that everything is going OK OK. any problems with i'm seeing or hearing anything that isn't there. Any thoughts about self harm."

16255.0,Patient,"i'm it was, and then it. I felt like it was kind of crashing a little bit, and so I started doubling up and it still doesn't really do it i'm still not feeling good."
498.0,Provider,Are you are you taking did you double up on the 20 milligrams or are you doubling up on 10 so How long have you been taking a total of 40 milligrams.
16255.0,Patient,Probably about a month.
498.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. About four weeks, you should should theoretically feel at least How long have you been on this, a telegram from from conception. Did you start off at 10 or did you start off at 20."

498.0,Provider,i'm.
16255.0,Patient,Not I know of.
498.0,Provider,"I would only recommend that you gave it another two to four weeks at the current 40 milligrams. Only because. you've been on it for about a year and a half, and if if you've been Okay, so far, most recently on the 20 you doubled up over the holidays, the holidays are kind of peculiar. Most people. have to kind of buckle down or the holiday it's just a tough four weeks back in yeah so not not not having a perceived benefit from doubling up on the medication during the holidays. isn't necessarily an indication the medication is working, it could have just been like you know, a difficult moment i'm more interested if you continue to not receive any benefit over the next four weeks, how do you feel about just giving it another four weeks at the current 40."
16255.0,Patient,yeah that's fine I feel like once I am back on adderall to it will help because I can at least.

She doesn't have any interest in explaining her toys at this time, so i'll make the request for her reestablish. regularity up or urine drug screens and admit her to my Monday group with an audra i'll go ahead and refill our now. For the adderall for plus one, and she will join me in group on Mondays in order to to continue her. therapy so it's at risk to the patient as low, even though she is expressing some recent difficulty with regard to her low mood could be attributed to the absence of the adderall and the difficulty with regard to attention and focus and concentration that's. causing a dive in her mood so let's see if we can make the correction with the reestablishment of our adderall regimen and go from there recording stuff."
