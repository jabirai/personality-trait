705.0,Provider,"hello, how are you."
3767.0,Patient,i'm well how about yourself.
705.0,Provider,"i'm very well, thank you for asking how was your holiday."
3767.0,Patient,"really good yeah those festive it was a foreign and you know it's good around good to be around the family, how about yours."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I had more of just a staycation so it was nice just to you know I didn't have any of the airlines, because you flew somewhere right."
3767.0,Patient,"No, I fly on Wednesday, the fifth."
705.0,Provider,"that's right, this is afterwards."
3767.0,Patient,yeah a lot of the there were hundreds of flights canceled.
705.0,Provider,yeah i've made the choice not to go back to Texas so it's very happy with my choice.
3767.0,Patient,Beautiful that's really good yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, but you're still you know I mean hopefully by then they have worked out the kinks with the airlines."
3767.0,Patient,"I didn't get a notice so. You know i'm looking forward to it, and my mom knows we're coming. and What. I got my driver's license."
705.0,Provider,can go. whoa that's been in the making right.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah just it was like I didn't know what to do it myself, it took me a minute to process it, but at the same time I wasn't lost or or weirded out, I was just so excited. It was a big weight off my shoulders. But it didn't weigh on me to the point where I was worried about it, I honestly didn't care for years because I live in the city. And I got rid of my car in 2012 I was like i'm not going to dream 20 $800 total. To pay the two dmv that I owe for a car, to have a license and then not have a car in a area where I live, using public transportation."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3767.0,Patient,"You know um but anyway it's all history, I got it I said, you know it's time I was going to get it years ago and found out about the money I owed."
705.0,Provider,high.
3767.0,Patient,"And then I was like no the situation it just doesn't make sense, and now you know. Going back to buffalo I should have had a license to drive my mom around and do things. But we did stuff anyway, and I would use uber relatives would come and get us. So, and I had already gotten in trouble years back so whatever they thought of me about the fact they had to pick me up I could have cared less."
705.0,Provider,You made that decision.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah I you know I had to move forward at my own pace, and anyway it made a lot of sense I got the license and. You know i'm going to rent a car. Oh kind of in buffalo and. So that's what's coming up."
705.0,Provider,Is there any plans to then to maybe purchase a car or is that just in the works.
3767.0,Patient,yeah probably August. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Well, in the event that you need to go in, because I know on public transportation that took many hours would you derive or what would be your better option."
3767.0,Patient,I would have to drive and I would have to do it super early and then get out of there you know no later than two or three.
705.0,Provider,But that would allow you to take the time to maybe listen to a podcast or something in the luxury of your own vehicle.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I do that now, a little bit when I travel and. So. Anyway, sorry about that that was a text from bright heart health i'm not sure, because I checked in I apologize."
705.0,Provider,"No, no worries. I can see that you checked in or you just thinking that."
3767.0,Patient,"No, it was a really long text, and I think it was just extra info that went with the link. It wasn't as long as the normal one, so I thought there was some kind of message in there. Okay sorry about that."
705.0,Provider,"No, no worries at all i'm just looking to see and I I don't know if one of them is maybe the link to the surveys."
3767.0,Patient,yeah oh it's just said you're checked in and then i'll read it out after.
705.0,Provider,Exactly so then with the upcoming trip you got your driver's license we're coming to the end of the 2021 any any thoughts about nearing the end of this year.
3767.0,Patient,yeah so um. it's it's been a long year but it's been a really good year on the 27th of December I celebrated 19 months over. that's number one. and My friend left.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
3767.0,Patient,"he's still waiting on the offer to be finalized I don't know what they're doing and he's still applying to jobs, he had to go back to Florida and. He was here for four months, I told you about how I took them in and. Right, so it benefited both of us he did a lot of music stuff with me he knows a lot about a piece of equipment and he worked on that was like taking a full course he's an expert in it. And in this piece of equipment that drum machine that I pointed to it's even more than the drum machine what you can really do with it, and he happens to work, you know he works for the company and. As a consultant and product specialist he stopped being a full timer. and The. I mean he's one of the best experts in the country on it so anyway, we had a great situation for four months, but it has a little bit you know, anyway, what i'm saying is after four months I having a roommate now I don't. that's."
705.0,Provider,A judgment.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I, my main point and i'm. I addressed, something that kept coming up with ISA. And so. If she drank and he was here, it was a nightmare I couldn't escape i'm him here still like my morning is different than his a little bit. Plus, he had a lot of things that have you know, been carrying over and it got better and all that and part of wives here but um. I realized how much. That yeah I was suppressing some feelings. And I never, never want to drink. mm hmm but. I have to give myself some credit, because at the end of the day. I just managed it. And I, and I wasn't going to the gym which I really need to do more that's a big one, but i've done some power walks recently I went to a meeting last night."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, how was that."
3767.0,Patient,It was awesome so. So i'm just reflecting on having my time and space to really focus and not be distracted.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3767.0,Patient,"So I can have a busy schedule working on music have work and be able to balance things and not be so distracted and worry about all this stuff. And i'm including you know, a healthy weekly program that I do, which would include at least one, a meeting anyway and. It it was good, it was good. yeah it was fine it was I just listened, I decided to share at the end or wasn't once time and. um I just said that you know all the gifts that we call them we call them gifts. And I said I really just you know I said it's wonderful and I said, my point of view is that when you stop drinking and you cut out all the bad behavior and your bullshit shenanigans. And yeah things start to improve and I said i'm not saying that in a negative way I said, but the gift and i'm driving at here my point I want to make. Is the gift of paying it forward and some things that I was able to do to help a friend and he's not an alcoholic but he was using it as a crutch and I felt like something was going to go bad fast."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3767.0,Patient,"And um and we were running out of time, and you know and people were welcoming and I didn't get any weird vibes from anyone, there were some people who you could tell just you know there they got stuff going on, you know and. I saw. Two or three people kind of go. like that, when a guy made a particular comment during a share and. I was like Okay, you know no big deal, I decided i'm not gonna let that bother me so because I think it was inappropriate, but I don't think he caught it."
705.0,Provider,"After right turn your experience because you're bringing your experience to it and that it's like you said about the other person to that's what they're going through that day, who knows where they are."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah these three people when he was sharing talking about going to more meetings and how you know it's better it's better, for he goes for now I guess to you know I don't think he was downplaying I was just the way he communicated. With me I could see where they interpreted as. Oh well, he thinks it's good for now that he's going to meetings and then he'll do whatever he wants after because he's going to manage it, and he thinks he'll beat it like like is that judgment and like and and. You know, maybe they're right and maybe they're not but they don't need that body language when sharing yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And i'm hearing to James that you have empathy where you know what it's like to be there and that it. is more beneficial if it's a non judgment zone, and so, how that can hinder someone especially early in recovery."
3767.0,Patient,"It was subtle and I think it was more of me i'm looking to see because I heard the comment, and I was like. You know he's struggling to go to more meetings and maybe he thinks that he doesn't have to stay sober for the rest of his life you hear these comments, like that, like it's fine for now, you know i'm. i'm not passing judgment, but when I heard him say that I could see where you know, maybe if it was open discussion people would say hey you know you're right it's fine for now we got 24 hours at a time. But it is a lifelong thing so for now is good if you see it as i'm doing as much as I can do, and then day by day or for now. it's what i'm supposed to do and i'll be fine later I can drink whenever I want we don't we don't it's you know he didn't say one way or the other but it could be interpreted in both ways, and it was a nice sherry had and when he said that I was kind of you know I looked. For body language, and you know I wasn't surprised I caught a couple people rolling your eyes and I didn't say anything, and I was I looked at him and he didn't pick up on it and and the meaning continued. Nobody knows that I did."
705.0,Provider,"And it can be to, or sometimes a person needs to just put it out there and share the way that they feel that day and that doesn't mean that they're going to carry through with it, that doesn't mean those things are going to happen, they just needed to share. And just see that."
3767.0,Patient,Good for him i'm glad it was there.
705.0,Provider,yeah yeah how it is you know you get a room full of different sometimes personalities and then.
3767.0,Patient,"You know who knows right because some could be old timers right with a lot of time. um who are the type of people who have to go to meetings every single day and um and they're pretty involved and that's great and. They might be raising an eyebrow with judgment others might be in a different place and they hear something like that and they're like. What do you mean does he mean I can do this, whenever I want i'm like i'm here because I don't want to do it whenever I want so that you know what what's going on inside their you they're really passing judgment, we shouldn't or. they're, like the other people want to hear that it's, not just for now that's what they want to hear. Right and that's why they're there, so you just don't know where people like to come from you don't know where people are coming from what baggage they carry that day. And i'm not passing judgment and even now that I put this time and energy into our conversation about what people are thinking about it it's you know it's not doing me any good either think that way. To get somebody That way, you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah it's their interpretation.
3767.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,And then it didn't stop I mean i'm hearing it doesn't stop you from going to another meeting because it was beneficial for you.
3767.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah and i'm going to go to meetings and i'm not going. to worry about that kind of stuff because you know time to time it happens, it was no big deal. it's just that I experienced something like that that was really bad like two or three times over a period of like whatever how many months, which is why, then, I said no, and i'll tell you this, I think it was my first meeting and maybe a year. And I was determined. I was determined I was so pissed off from before I was like that's it i'm not going for a whole year, like a child. But I really didn't want to go it wasn't it really wasn't That was the knee jerk reaction, but as time passed I kept saying to myself, you should go, you should go, you should go. And, and you know there's no substitute, you have a combination program and you should go, you should go, you should go and then I kept telling myself. You don't feel the need to run there, and you don't feel like you're going to get anything out of it and then you're going to go with a bad attitude. And then what's going to happen if you don't like what somebody says to somebody else you're going to get mad and criticize them for being judgmental. So I said don't go until you're ready when you feel it then go and I felt it I needed to go. I didn't want to drink, but I needed to go yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And that's even better James that you didn't go when are ready, you know you were in that cycle you're going because it felt right it's where you are today."
3767.0,Patient,"It is an eye it's great I have all these skills from you from our group, and all the work that i've done and I noticed that i'm really using them at the right time. And and it's it's it's nonstop it doesn't stop. You know, when I need to think about some things that i'm going through I pull out my CBD deck of cards and I pull on from the category that is specifically going to address what I have going on at that moment yeah you know I add that, to my journal than I do, or one pager. As part of the one pager if I God fearing resentment going on i'll do or cheap."
705.0,Provider,"And that you have these tools in your toolbox, and you know where they are and you've worked through of knowing what may help with that you know different events."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah and you know I got to be an adult because you know I get pissed off when I once people get judgmental your day you know the impact that can have. And and. You know. cuz you know it when i'm 53 right when I was 23 or even 33 and someone did that in the meeting, and it was obvious to others i'm like well you're rolling your eyes, for I would say that. But I don't do that now. Right gamma but say what are you doing this guy wants to be in a meeting where he's going to see that what are you kidding. me he's like I want to come back. he's gonna go drink and worse, possibly. intention versus impact this is something that hit hard. When I did the coaching essentials and my natural tendencies was you know, I have a very clear picture of things that i'm going to continue to work on and i'm kind of shifting a little bit going this way but. I i'm happy about that and. I don't know I feel I feel really happy and i'm trying to keep myself focused. and enthusiastic and you know, I have a lot of energy. So I have the cheering what right."
705.0,Provider,"It can fill out James your passion and you get passionate and I know you're a big advocate. You know, for others, and I can see in that meeting. And it's nice to see you get to the place where you can be selective of when you want to spend your time and energy to be that advocate and to be able to turn that off to to just be in the moment be at the meeting it was for you."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah. it's a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful thing I mean, these are. These other things right, this is the way things are supposed to go it's funny my friend, said to me, he goes you emptied your storage unit. Since i've been here you started a new job since i've been here, you did all these really important courses for music production over the last year and now you're getting a whole new workflow with that thing he worked on with me, you have all this great. stuff and. And you get your license, and all this, he goes. And said yeah he goes you you put your life back together and and this time you're doing it proper and you're just starting, he said, think about everything you're going to do now. It took you a year to get everything back together and now what's going to happen. And I said. Not good things great things. You know i'm not doing this i'm saying I got a lot of work to do with work and with my music production, but I aim high."
705.0,Provider,And you've built that foundation. You didn't count to already it's complete. You built the Foundation now you're advancing and each of the stages and so good for you and for where you are it took time and dedication and some really good self discoveries.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah yeah there really has and. i'm. So this is relevant East has been great I will. I was supposed to go to he says, after therapy and spend the rest of my work day and not working tomorrow. And I text her own coming over after therapy and she said at foods co said some. Sebastian picking me up when done. that's her daughter's boyfriend i'm. I got I gotta stay positive my friend talked a lot about this with me about ISA. And, and he said, you have to stop letting her manipulate you. don't answer her don't talk to her don't give into her bullshit because you give her power and she's going to manipulate more and I said I don't care about power, he goes i'm not I don't mean it like that he goes you give her leverage. and That talks. What the hell, are you doing it food co after the holidays are done and your family's all set with food and i'm good with food, what the hell you doing there she went out alone, and they carry boobs. I don't know if that's true."
705.0,Provider,that's what it feels like and brings you well he's gonna bring her here.
3767.0,Patient,she'll say don't bring me home. And she's going to come in park here so she waits for her moment she sneaks over to it comes here and plops and traps me. it's completely manipulative and deceptive. So.
705.0,Provider,"Your friend pointed out, and then i'm hearing that you're taking a look at it."
3767.0,Patient,Are you doing. I don't know what.
705.0,Provider,To say and are you at the point James where you're like you know what I have to address this.
3767.0,Patient,yeah. I can text her bag. I just said okay well i'll see you at your House.
705.0,Provider,yeah your your plan says you're going there to her house. And that that's that's where you're at right now.
3767.0,Patient,"yep. I don't know. I. don't know we're going to buffalo soon. she's out and about Maybe she wants to the goodwill next door, this is the one in Pittsburgh i'm thinking about and she wanted to go back there. And I talked about not going out in public places much at all because we're leaving soon, and I don't want to put my mother at risk of the coven and. So she's trying she hasn't been doing much either so she's she's she wears a mask and everything so. Oh. So there you go this was something that I needed to like communicate right away in therapy, I saw that toxin that was upsetting because I know what that means. You cannot be trusted I don't trust her at all I don't trust her at all. she's a liar. that's what alcoholics do they lie. Constantly."
705.0,Provider,"When they're when they're actively using and you're still in there and I I know before you said, James that there's that connection that she was there for you and it's difficult to establish that hard boundary."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah. and wonder what's going to happen now. and see part of me said. To. Look at my phone, because I can tracker. I can track her I know where she is because there's been multiple times, where she's gone and no one knew where she was and people panic and. And then I said, you know that that's it I gotta go into her phone when she's not around I gotta share location to myself and then delete that notification came and social she won't know that I did that and. So multiple. Multi multiple times i've had to use it to go find her, and so did her daughter."
705.0,Provider,level of distrust and to use it device is this where you are right now chains is this okay with you.
3767.0,Patient,"um yeah she's an active alcoholic so it's all bets off all these different things and it's a lot of things. So that's what's been difficult, as time has progressed I kill you made your choice you being compassionate you lover you your this is going to happen, you got to manage it don't blow up but I realize more and more. it's all bets off as soon as she drinks, you can hope for anything to be good. And I would still for a while, oh that should be OK, though know this should be OK, though no. it's all bets are off soon as you drink it's all bets are off. So I I kept telling myself that that wasn't going to be the case, it wouldn't automatically be all bags off as soon as she drinks and it is not all bets off once he starts drinking when she continues. You know so."
705.0,Provider,"At some level content, then that need to control by thinking you can control it in a certain way, and then, as you know, you're always chasing that and it doesn't quite. A line."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah and, and the reason I have that is because I don't want some kind of into her like we found her next to a Bart station down a street of laying in the grass. She could she could have been abducted and killed and buried somewhere. like that. So. I watch too much ID network. But that's how it happens, I want she watches those shows a lot like whether it's that or something else bad that can happen, you know. And and. For me it's, not that I got out and constantly checking it if I have if I see it coming I can usually try to have an influence. and And I know, maybe I can't control it, but the biggest reason the biggest main reason is to make sure that I can get to her some drunk. But the other reason is, if I know that she's wandering around and she doesn't answer my calls and I see them that she's not at home and she's wondering I get my shit together and really the House."
705.0,Provider,"that's tough, just when you say that changed as you're having to leave your own home."
3767.0,Patient,and i'm going to text Sebastian. So. i'm going to call him do you mind he.
705.0,Provider,Go ahead.
3767.0,Patient,"This is all part of what's going on, no for me, am I should I not do this, am I, being rude."
705.0,Provider,"hey you know here's here's what I want you to think about because this situation has been going for some time right. And you're planning on going Wednesday. Out of state right. Is this for you, you know how do you want to handle this what is best for you and where you are today."
3767.0,Patient,"here's what i'm going to do. I think it'll be fine and even if she's drinking then she. won't impact us leaving. But if she binges and doesn't make that flight with me it's over. it's the last straw. i'll pack all her stuff up that's here i'll bring it over the House i'll block her on Facebook i'll block her email i'll take my phone the phone back I don't want to say, like that, but. i'll take the phone back i'll take the iPad back i'll take the other tablet back i'll take all those things so she doesn't have those devices for. Her pleasure her needs to communicate everything i'll just rip that from her not physically and i'm blocking Blocker and bring your stuff and it'll all happen like that and I won't talk to her because that's how I have to deal with it."
705.0,Provider,hearing a very healthy voluntary games as you're you're willing today to see how this plays out you're there to be supportive but at some point it gets to where enough is enough that it's stepped over that boundary and it's becoming too unhealthy for you. And to me that's that's valid if if a trip has been planned and that's going to interfere with it is taken a hard line of what that means for you in the relationship at this time.
3767.0,Patient,yeah and I hate that I have to think that way it's like it's almost like i'm hoping that it happens. Because I don't know how to deal with this and i'm half in and half out on a regular basis i'm a caregiver.
705.0,Provider,"Well she's someone that. He what i'm hearing is that you love her you love her you care about her you don't want her to get in harm's way. You also, though, want to be in a relationship that you can trust the other person that you don't have to have these like waiting for attacks and how am I going to respond to this and what does this mean. You felt such a foundation and Is this something. That you feel you want to continue to invite in."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah it's tough. um, but I also like this stress plus my friend being here. And the new job like it literally took me. And she made a comment she goes. She goes I don't you don't have to what did I say I said. um. I said something about going over there and I said well come over, we can have coffee, but then I gotta go. or whatever, when I she goes Oh well, I don't need you to like fit me in. Like i'm an afterthought, I told you how I feel about that, and I said. So I told her, and I was like you know you you've made this comment, a few times but there's a difference between intention and the way you take it, and I said and i'm i'm making time for you. Making sure I make time for you, because I want to."
705.0,Provider,know your important.
3767.0,Patient,"If you take it a particular way and you turn it into negative energy that's on you. and coming up in the new year i'm starting a new class again at night I got a busy new job. i'm trying to stay healthy and stay sober i've got a packed schedule that i'll manage and we'll have lots of time together, but I don't want you to think that, if I have to schedule you in on a certain week because i'm so busy that you're an afterthought i'm busy. God forbid, you found a hobby and got a job. Okay. So. I didn't say that to her, but that's how I feel."
705.0,Provider,"And that's where the resentment part comes in, then."
3767.0,Patient,Continue you see.
705.0,Provider,"I can hear it, I can hear it."
3767.0,Patient,Oh yeah your face.
705.0,Provider,"And then the way that you're hearing your body, the tone everything you change James."
3767.0,Patient,yeah and now that whole little thing right there that was I would give myself a nine and 10 for being an asshole but. i'm not proud of it.
705.0,Provider,"I didn't read asshole that's not what I read James is I read someone that's truly trying to work this relationship out you cared deeply and that working on to that boundary. Of where you know, is it going into enabling or is it going into you've been role modeling and doing what you can and that your life is getting very full and that you spent a lot of time and energy to get it where it is today. How much risk, are you willing to continue to put out and is that healthy for you. And you just now, did I hear 19 months. yeah 19 months."
3767.0,Patient,Two years and may 27 that's what that's what it'll be. A when I make it that far yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so these things are all important to you, and so, for you to have the piece, where the concern and that extra part i'm hearing you don't have time for that not meaning you don't want to spend time with her you don't have time because you're you have your plate is pretty full. So it's a new new boundary being set."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah and. I can. And then you know it's like I opened up to her and told her about all this stuff that's been going on and how I felt and how literally. I reflected even more and had this big breath of air and collapse, but not a total breakdown almost more more than relief and i've been i've been kind of depressed and I said but I handled everything well and I didn't drink and I wanted to let you know and. And I said so you're not going to come over, and I was like I need to rest and and i'll come over tomorrow after therapy. And then, an hour later, while i'm making this for dinner. Okay that's good enjoy. So you're not going to come over we just had a conversation. So. it's manipulative. that's what pisses me off, not what she says her how she says it the fact that it's being said at all it's manipulative."
705.0,Provider,"When your friend was here too, and you managed and you've been trying James since you and I have been working together these different ways that you're managing and these different ways to see if she's able. To you know, be at her best and to be healthy and that you will allow for some times that people make mistakes and you've been the supportive boyfriend and being there. It gets to be a place like you know with Alan I have you ever gone to an Al anon meeting."
3767.0,Patient,"You know it's interesting i've been to a bunch of them a long time ago and I was a teacher and I sat in i'm in allentown school that a counselor Ram at the school. And I did that, because some of my students were in there. So. Sorry, I checked the location."
705.0,Provider,Old habits are hard to break.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah now it's more than enough i've done this now and we're talking so at that that's not that's not polite the. i've been to them yeah, so I think I need to go soon."
705.0,Provider,A lot of what you're sharing today James is just to get where you're not alone and to hear how other people to where. Maybe when when their point of where they had to realign what their boundaries were and learning from them and then learning from you and just being able to say it out loud and having a space that you can go to.
3767.0,Patient,yo. yo i'm going to do that I gotta go download. So.
705.0,Provider,"it's almost at the the timing to James it's sometimes the end of the year can really propel us into reevaluating what's important what are our values, what do we want this next year to look like and putting those intentions out."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. i've got. I don't feel disorganized I don't feel discombobulated. What. I think more. than ever before. Even when I was in my bounce back phase. You know those first 30 6090 especially. Because it's a. it's you know it's all bounced back recovery, but you know it takes time but but that initial like 30 and 90 days like that's a serious, you know and so anyway, what i'm saying is that i've got. i'm gonna have a busy schedule and i'm not afraid of it i'm not worried about it. And i'm going to immerse myself so much in that that. um. What time, I do have with her i'm gonna I want to look forward to it, and I want it to be good, and I need to communicate this to her. Yes, because otherwise I blow up at her. But she doesn't know. What I just said, like, I mean she knows that she knows that but I haven't communicated specifically. i'm going to be busy. let's plan to have a date night once a week and do some stuff but i'm so busy don't feel like i'm just fitting you when I said. And at the same time, when if it's a day when I have class and I have a lot to do at work and i'm working on music stuff there are some days i'm just not i'm just busy. If you're going to come over and then we'll cook dinner and you're going to stay then that's great I said, but you can't come to me drunk. I have a busy, I have a busy schedule and. You know, life is by design."
705.0,Provider,And that's a very reasonable asked.
3767.0,Patient,"To yeah. And you know as long as she's not working in an active alcoholic. i'll be compassionate i'm not going to preach i'm not i'm not gonna play counselor but. You know, there were there there's been you know it's just i'm heartbroken. I got her an iPad put a couple Apps on there for doing clothing design that are easy to use she's got the pencil for it, she uses it for her group. And I showed her some basics, I said that's all I was like you can she uses it a little bit. Then I got Bernie browns recent book for both of us and said, maybe we can read it at our own pace, and if you want once in a while we can you know something comes up, we can talk about it and. um. No phones up."
705.0,Provider,I was just gonna say James you've put out a bunch of resources.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah and. And now you know. there's a fire tablet dad. I gave her that the grants on the as the day use that they have, and I said the ipads not for the kids so now he uses it and other kids use it, she doesn't use it as much the Bernie brown book sat has been sitting in that box for a month. And I said, you know I they haven't read mine either, and I was like Oh, she goes no this is your ideas, because i'm not reading it down i'm not reading anytime soon."
705.0,Provider,Where are you with the book.
3767.0,Patient,I scan through the chapters and that's all I did know.
705.0,Provider,"Is that something, though, why you're going through this James to just put some time and energy into also you bought the book you want it, you thought you know what this is good for me it's resonating and i'll."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah. we're just we're just living different lives. She doesn't have the same motivation, she doesn't have a job she doesn't take care of herself and see drinks, so it can't I can't sustain this once owners."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that doesn't mean that you give up on the person that's just on their relationship for right now, maybe it needs to be different than what it was before. you're protecting to what you've worked for and to be able to see, then, that if you're not there with the resources and that that support. Will it then cause her to go in a different direction that could be healthy that could then where there's not going to be, you know, like you said you're picking her up when she's falling down."
3767.0,Patient,"i'm enabling basically in some ways i'm enabling and i'm. deep down, I know that. Either I am the relationship or i'm so immersed in my own life that she's really not included that much and then she'll just walk away."
705.0,Provider,"While you're working this out is really doubling down on all those things that make you feel good James with the working out with doing you know your form when you need it with bringing in you know if you need a meeting trying out al anon. and trying to just each day to pull yourself back and go, you know what just for today just for today i'm sober okay after that now let's look here's work here's you know prioritize."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah so. I went from elated to like this as soon as I got that text you see. But that's okay i'll manage it and i'm dealing with it better and better and. So i've got to tell her, I never tell her this is that every time you go all by yourself, you drink it's very rare that you don't and I can't trust you and it twists my stomach. so bad that I can barely focus, I can barely read because i'm so upset and i'm so emotional. And I, and I don't. I feel. It doesn't give a Fuck she's an alcoholic. Maybe she cares but she doesn't try hard enough. it's a disease. There are things that you have to take it takes time, I have to be compassionate. But other than a few exceptions in life, if you haven't succeeded or accomplish something is because you haven't tried harder. Other than some exceptions."
705.0,Provider,And there's different outlets there's there's different outlets in different ways. And you're being supportive and you've been supportive James and now having those conversations is then where i'm going for my own pieces insanity. To set this healthy boundary and then she can make. The commitment or if she's not able to at that time.
3767.0,Patient,"yeah. Part of the reason I stopped going to the gym. Is because I didn't have the energy, because I was so emotionally drained. So i'm not going to drink. But here's the worst part. i'm not reading like I want either at least a little bit each day and i'm not practicing my workflow and my music production as much as I should be because I am flatlined, so to speak. So it's impacting me all lot and i'm and then I get angry angry at her angry at me, so this is going to go like this until something significant. there's got to be a change right."
705.0,Provider,"Right and i'm hearing that that changes your you're healthy and you're you're making all these changes and you're constantly adapting. yo, it is now getting where it is literally affecting your mood it's affecting like you said you know where you were when we first started. This initial session to where you are now and that that's unpredictable I mean life's not predictable, but we do like to have some sort of routine if we can we just when we we want to you know. To have that it's almost like hitting you keep hitting well the buzzer keeps almost like it where you're like and it's not it's all these different times, where I see like you're getting in the anger, the enzyme at. Depression."
3767.0,Patient,"yeah I get depressed sometimes Oh, my goodness, excuse me i'm sorry."
