527.0,Provider,"i'm sorry that's okay well I just rushed home to see because I was just rushed home, I was with my dad."
6947.0,Patient,and am I supposed to say my name or anything first.
527.0,Provider,"No, but you probably just came to my room and didn't check in right."
6947.0,Patient,yeah I shouldn't have done that. that's okay.
527.0,Provider,No that's okay i'll check in i'll check in this time so yeah no but no big deal.
6947.0,Patient,"Okay fence. yeah yeah. That was. Coming on the House with my dad and then I got a call three or four minutes ago from my new job of the lady at my new job that must have talked to me and i'm like. yeah i'm gonna have to call you back you know. Just like Okay, and you know cuz she doesn't know the whole story that they. know now, I have a job, but is there any way we can we can do like a half hour today or or you know. that's fine obviously need these meetings and I and that they're my priority but. it's just that was crazy time she went to."
527.0,Provider,"Share share. that's fine because I need the job bad. yeah so well fill me in where How are things going, since we last spoke sounds like a lot lot of things are going on."
6947.0,Patient,"A lot yeah um so yeah just been busy i'm just still working on myself every day, and you know still trying to get out get some exercise and. Fishing and everything and then, but obviously the majority of what i've been doing is looking for jobs, and you know and it's like all at the same time, they all call back at the same time."
527.0,Provider,So with him when yeah.
6947.0,Patient,"which was good and bad because what I did was I was like I already knew this job that I that I got is good at. Red lobster it's. A server a red lobster which would be good. For right now I mean we make good tips, I think you know i'm pretty sure it's been a while, since i've served tables, but I mean I did that for years before I worked, or for a couple years before I worked in golf. Okay, so remember it but anyways I was saying, I got a call from sportsman's warehouse and a lot of like really cool fishing like. Fishing places that I could have worked for. And so it's just it just kind of you know, it was a bummer so I had to tell them what you know that i'm going to be making more money somewhere else, I appreciate the call because they they're like Oh, can you show up to orientation today. i'm like I haven't even I haven't even talked to you guys in like. A week and a half or. So, but I guess that's how it works nothing works fast when you want it to only when. You don't want. It all works like that so. yeah so I settled on the red lobster thing, because I know the tips that they make there, so I mean I pretty much had to set or I pretty much had to I want to say settled but yeah I had to. Go for that. Sure, I just hope that works out with me and you know I just hope the job works out that's, the only thing i've been stressing about lately. Okay um."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I mean what are the potential reasons that wouldn't."
6947.0,Patient,well.
527.0,Provider,Or is it just your negative thoughts.
6947.0,Patient,"yeah. it's partly my worst case scenarios, you know, usually tend to be what I imagine. You know, things you know, usually things starting out as we're. Okay going but i'm i'm just also were too, because I remember how fast paced, that is, and I don't want to forget stuff and i'm. And they don't know that i'm you know I don't know sometimes like on the questionnaire that we have for the you know the weekly question you had asked you sometimes do you feel like. You, or does it it's something like do you feel like you forget things that you sad, are you forget things you've done throughout the day or whatever so i'm just worried that that it's going to be that i'm going to have some mishaps. You know, because of medication does that does that some slots are really."
527.0,Provider,"Reasonable yeah I mean, are you are you allowed to use a notepad or write down orders and things like."
6947.0,Patient,That that's The good thing is yes.
527.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, I mean."
6947.0,Patient,"From what i've seen when i'm there because you know I go there every once in a while my dad you know. his girlfriend i'll go and i'll go with them, and from what i've seen yeah definitely a notepad I would definitely need that. yeah that's gonna be. i'm just gonna learn how to learn how to me that's what I used to do and I just write as fat."
527.0,Provider,"Obviously, with show servers and waitresses do is."
6947.0,Patient,"is right as fast as they can. which for me is it's terrible handwriting anyway, but but but no, I know little tricks like you know to not have to spell out the whole entire freakin you know yeah I know how to do all that. But i'm still. it's still worries me that. they're like i'm gonna forget stuff like you know, so you know my table might ask for like you know cocktail sauce or something and i'm just so already worried that shit you know. yeah half hour later you're gonna be like. hey bro."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I wonder if you could do like some times. Like maybe like put some scenarios out on. areas in your House and time yourself with like a notepad and you know do like a like a run through of you know i've got i've got a service these four tables in the next 10 minutes So how do I get all the orders in and then. And then come back and these these people went to cocktail sauce so which which table, one of the extra cocktail sauce and do some of those quizzes with yourself, I wonder. If that."
6947.0,Patient,"that's a really good idea that's and that reminds me to that this Kim her name is Kim she's the manager there she's awesome. she's she's really nice lady and I had she she has her mask on and we're talking but I could, I get the vibe that she's really, really cool like she's a genuinely good manager for. Like if you were to imagine a good manager for like she's just awesome and she even told me that she's going to be doing, because I didn't outright say it, the way I did to you, but I. learned it I learned, it is a it's been a while. Since i've served and and i'm just being honest, you know I want to do it again and it's been a while um so she was like Oh well, you know we do we do tests like test training and we do sample ringing. ringing and. they're gonna have me probably ringing in different you know just fake orders so you're saying you know. Work on on what I think and she's the type of person that I think would. You know just not trying to make you feel like an idiot you know but. You know you're not gonna i'm not gonna build a mess up you know all the time, but."
527.0,Provider,I did.
6947.0,Patient,"And I don't think I will, but I just want to do do a good job she I haven't even worked there yet and she'd already makes me want to feel like i'm doing. A good job."
527.0,Provider,so good.
6947.0,Patient,"That part looks really promising yeah. As far as yeah so so that did help me a little bit, knowing that red lobster itself has a very structured training program it sounds like."
527.0,Provider,"You know, they want it done exactly the way they want it done, which is good for me."
6947.0,Patient,"Because, if I have to follow things to a TEE that just makes me feel like i'm not gonna veer off."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and I would think it would just. Show like consistency to like if everybody's doing the same. thing. One yeah yeah then it makes makes it much there's no. kind of second guessing. You know rough as. Well, good so have you started or you."
6947.0,Patient,"know she. She said, the last time I talked to her. She she just said, to go on the Internet and get a food course nowadays, I guess, you have to get a food handlers course training card. Okay it's like this $8 video, you have to pay and watch and then you have to pass, you have to get 70 points or higher pat or 70% I got 86%."
527.0,Provider,But they were hard.
6947.0,Patient,"Questions like. stuff like how. Like how how what degree is chicken supposed to be if you're serving it this way, like i'm thinking that's the that's they're asking me shifts like a question you definitely a chef I would think and I guess they think they're everybody needs to know it and I guess it makes sense."
527.0,Provider,You know sure sure.
6947.0,Patient,"And it's all for the health, you know it's for health and safety, because obviously you can get pretty sick if. Right, so they talked about cross contamination and. which I already knew, you know every most people should know if you're going to use a cutting board. So all that stuff. Yes, more or less it was just all that."
527.0,Provider,"Easy stuff sure. Sure, well, I wonder if part of it is you know if the board of health comes through and and grabs a server and says hey what's the temperature chicken. You know you you, you know, like they can do I, because I know that you know facilities that i've worked in you know border health comes in and reviews things, and you, you have to know it, whether you're working at department or not. Necessary yeah so that may that may be part of it. But it, you know, whatever it's making sure you're serving food accurately for people to so."
6947.0,Patient,"ya know the more I wanted it I enjoyed it actually because it's information that it's like i'm glad i'm watching this because, when I. go into a restaurant. Personally, when i'm not I would I would hope that people would see that video you know because there's probably some people that don't know you know the you should wash your hands for 20 seconds 15 to 20 seconds, at least, and just weird symbols. You know, basic you know stuff like that. But um anyways i'm happy I got the job at least I hope i'll have some some income. At least for. Training day. It was funny I just. I shouldn't have said this, but I was like Oh, you know i'll come in and do a couple hours you know for free, if I have to you know extra she's like no, I have to pay you I was like yeah no. i'm just. yeah but."
527.0,Provider,"graduations congratulations. I know you've been you know, trying to find something but also trying to balance that with taking care of yourself too so."
6947.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, and I, the only thing the only good thing I thought about this job is obviously i'm going to be walking around be more on my feet so that's i'll get my exercise the day. And that's that's. And then, food, you know i've cut out all the bad foods so which is crazy to give you 50% off there, while you're. So, but still, you know it'll be salmons good for you so i'll beat and stuff like that you know salmon and and like whatever trout I know they serve trout seasonally and all that he will you know you've been there, you know they serve all sorts of stuff."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. But they got the grilled stuff and some salads and put shrimp on them, or whatever."
6947.0,Patient,chicken yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah you can find. Your find good stuff.
6947.0,Patient,Well you're an indiana right.
527.0,Provider,uh huh.
6947.0,Patient,They have a lot of red lobsters.
527.0,Provider,"Actually, when like 10 minutes down the street for me."
6947.0,Patient,"For a minute I was you know i'm talking about it, like it's mcdonald's but then I forget some. People might I mean. yeah depending on where you live, you know, like on the east coast, they have probably a different one right. yeah you're all the way on the east coast."
527.0,Provider,"yeah they need, and then you'd really want like fresh out of. Israel. yeah. yeah yeah."
6947.0,Patient,right but.
527.0,Provider,"Well, good well some time out of the House to for your you know just to balance that I know you try to keep yourself busy, and out of the House, but I think there still is a little bit of isolation with you, too, so."
6947.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah must have given yourself some structure structure of a schedule again.
6947.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah now I noticed that when you said that in the morning, I noticed it's that's kind of a little bit like I said it's still the hardest part of the day for me, but I noticed instead of laying there for like an hour and a half i'll lay there for maybe like 20 minutes. play on my phone you know and then. i'll get up and then. I want to go back to lay down, which is good. And I attribute that I attribute that to the exercise."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
6947.0,Patient,"Because i've lost like 45 pounds now. yeah, then I hope the way to, and I mean. Totally healthy i'm you know I haven't been starving myself or anything."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
6947.0,Patient,"I just wish I could lose weight in my face that's the only place. I mean you see my arm to get mine, you know, like, I was pretty chubby when I started, but I was over 200 pounds. When I started with you guys. So I hate to admit it, but exercise does help. I always hated admitting."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well and I think just you know it's gotten such a an ugly connotation to it, you know exercise this is. kind of a bad word, and so I always try to I always try to encourage people you know what makes it what makes you feel good just to move your body, you know, is it you know just. Is it dancing is it cleaning the House is it going for a walk is it riding a bike you know doing something that's not you know not have to define it as exercise like i'm just moving my body for my health."
6947.0,Patient,"Right. Right, I see what you're saying, but I. don't know if this was the wrong tactic, but I I seem to be taking it on more as like a pretty extreme method, like, I want to go like i've been running like every other day and and. i'm not saying I can like literally work myself to the ground and and and you know work through Depression and anxiety clean out of my body like I wish I could. But I don't see why stopping or slowing down. I mean, I see what you're saying everybody should get a little bit, but I think i'm gonna try a little harder and keep going harder and harder, I think. I mean, I know i'm not 28 i'm 38. Still."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, paying attention to your body to and resting when it needs to rest not."
6947.0,Patient,"Yes, that's true now as long as i'm listening i'm listening to my body like my legs and stuff. which are in good shape again but i'm just trying to listen to my body and and I guess you could call it like a whole new hobby I picked up. You can say. or a whole new passionate almost you know. Because it feels good it does look good to switch your butt off and then take a shower and then. Sit down couch because then when you're sitting on the couch i'm not guilty I don't feel guilty. In the in the evening or I mean later in the day."
527.0,Provider,yeah no.
6947.0,Patient,"Because, because at least you're like well I you know I put in some you know something I did something to try and make myself."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, have you noticed a difference in your Depression and anxiety."
6947.0,Patient,"Yes, I have actually I hate to admit it, but I don't hate to admit it, but yeah a little bit. And it's it's all yeah it's. Just mental just all mental a little I get I have a little more clarity, a little bit and. there's lots of benefits i've noticed since obviously you feel you know my body feels better. from eating. Just a whole bunch just just happy with the way I look i'm starting to feel too it's been a few years and. yeah so. just trying to be positive, with that and keep this going as long as I can. Because this is about usually the time that people go Oh, you know I got to my goal weight."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
6947.0,Patient,i'm cool now I only do that.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I think it's you know also recognizing I mean you're obviously seeing successes with it so. You know, can you know again finding that with whatever your schedule is you know finding that balance and recognizing there may be days that I don't fit it in, but other days you know i've got time to. To do it, and so and that's okay like not beating yourself up if he if you don't get in any exercise, because you may be moving your body in a different way that day."
6947.0,Patient,"You know right right. So yeah well that's a good point. yeah I try to keep in you know, keep keep in mind everything I did the day as a whole. As far as calorie loss, and you know all that stuff but um but yeah i'm i'm pretty excited about this i'm not gonna be able to fish as much. But it's getting cold, I think I can tell myself it's getting cold anyway, the fish."
527.0,Provider,"Well, you still need to find some time to go fish. For sure. I know yeah yeah."
6947.0,Patient,"But yeah no I mean yeah I still you know i've woke up in the middle of night and had some you know, like the depression isn't gone or going anywhere you're neither is the anxiety, but it's weird how I felt. You know I mentioned in the clarity thing it's almost like you're you have a little bit more control in your mind and a little more focused, I think, I think, from the from the just the overall health. So cheap and it's almost like I can have better self talk if that makes sense in the park is a little bit better. A little. more positive, I think, because because of the way I feel."
527.0,Provider,"Sure good. Good because that's something we needed to work on, you were really you had a really negative. tape glory for a while yeah."
6947.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. But. um yeah is, are we, is there any way I can go a little bit early today."
527.0,Provider,it's a color back i'm just curious on what she wants to ask. yeah that's fine.
