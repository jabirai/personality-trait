15750.0,Patient,"But yeah I mean Julie, told me if it was above like 343 50 I should go to the hospital, but it hasn't been luckily because i've been like. I got enough insulin I think the last me until I go to my appointment so it's hard to tell about the land is because I give myself it's a sliding scale. And i've been giving myself for the unit so i'm pretty sure I got enough to build lantus unless I have no or spike in my sugar. So I have enough philosophy is the 20th literally of this month, like, I see the endocrinologist. i'm thrilled do because I think I need a pump. That maintain you know if it helped me i'm so good, I hate it I hate giving myself this year, which is weird i'm on depends, too, by the way, so i'm not on like the regular needles they've all been I hate giving myself the shots like. walking around like hate it and I would like do better.

15750.0,Patient,This do not on TV. stuff there i'd like to take my prescription with me.
724.0,Provider,"Because they'll so I worked in the hospital before I came here and I worked in the er so your medication protocol all that stuff can be taken care of like as. You know, it might not happen as quickly as you wanted to, but they will do like what they call like a medical or medication our reconciliation will they'll pull all your data, you know, and even if you went in there with your prescription. You know, like this is my stuff this is where I take it, they won't let you take it. Once you fall on the hospital care it's their responsibility to medicate you so even if you had it, they would take it from you."
15750.0,Patient,"Okay, oh."
724.0,Provider,Oh that's how that's how it operated in my state i'm assuming.

15750.0,Patient,"Probably not for like a couple hours I got well right. Here, with is far enough away yeah. I would have to bail right back end up from family members so send me a couple hours, so we can finish."
724.0,Provider,"Okay well. As I do if that's if that's the case, I was going to have you disconnect with me and then call the virtual clinic called like how you signed into this right, did you talk to somebody like over the phone or. connect to your how did you connect."
15750.0,Patient,"Oh well, I had to call them and they ended up connecting me to the I think I have the number and my zoom. From the triage bit, the first time it's I had to speak with someone over the phone it was all messed up so hopefully it'll let me go straight through since I spoke with someone before."
724.0,Provider,"It might have so i'll just waiting out like a response back on. Okay um. I haven't got one yet so. log off this with me here. A contact in it that number again it tell them that you want to talk. To somebody if they're saying that you need to be like triage potentially you got some concerns you want to get addressed really quick, but ultimately i'd like you to go to the hospital, you know and."
15750.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"No that'd, be it and if worst case scenario, if you feel like it's progressively getting worse, or you don't feel like wait anymore you just dial nine one of the areas of sculpting you like. Right just do that you don't want to prolong this type of stuff. Now okay."
15750.0,Patient,I know about me i'm alone that for fox.
724.0,Provider,"I just because you have in the past as of yet you have to keep doing it. yeah that's a that's a that's a bad habit that you could break it anytime you want right, so you got to take care of your health. So we'll do that, so this kind of with me. contact them all, I do what you go to the hospital like that's. If you feel like it's a concert and you know."
15750.0,Patient,"there's that going on, I mean this is weird I know something my sugar because i've. been maintaining my sugar pretty well. yep so."
724.0,Provider,"If that's the case, then you should go, you know you can even skip the vc you should just hang up and call the ambulance and go to the hospital. worry about everything else later. Okay."

724.0,Provider,"Alright, for transcription That was the initiation of the boss like social for Leah. damn RON she's got significant medical histories and concerns currently she was presented with like stomach discomfort cramping. distended bloating I contacted Julie came and gave her a cursory background on what I thought was going on with her, I put in a request for her recommendation on slack through care knives have a RN team Member contact her. I did encourage her to to go to the hospital. it's ultimately her decision if she's going to contact the our ads once you disconnected for me. But the recommendation is that she go to the er and not wait for a ride just threw down I want she's got a myriad of medical concerns it's definitely above my scope to give her any kind of diagnosis is so. Self care is important so Hopefully she goes to the er and then we'll coordinate a follow up to this like social related time that's it Thank you."
