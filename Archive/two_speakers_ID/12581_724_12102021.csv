12581.0,Patient,"Good evening. it's things are things are good in terms of sobriety and. I you know I have those triggers but they're not. to a point where i'm drinking I don't feel the need to drink just trying to work out. You know, issues that have been that are kind of stuck in my head, but it's not anything that would make me want to drink."
724.0,Provider,Well what's what's triggering you currently.
12581.0,Patient,it's just pretty much. Just anger towards things that happened in the past to kind of resurface. it's.
724.0,Provider,Your turn oh. yeah just get more specific or you're gonna remain cryptic.
12581.0,Patient,"Now it's it's the previous job. i've had colleagues that I knew were hidden enemies. And so. i'm at this point we're. doing business with them now and I sent an email out saying hey can I get a quote for this instrument that could be up to a million dollars. And that that hidden enemy, who has who never included me in meetings never respond and it's been a week. So it's pretty much like do I take the high road and. Try to work with that person or go around them and say hey this this person who you employed is being unprofessional that could possibly fire him. and I was just like, why are you being so petty I don't it's and I suspect it's other people that are kind of manipulating him but."
724.0,Provider,I mean is this individual is are they at work or are they on vacation Is that why they're not getting back to you or.
12581.0,Patient,"Someone else I didn't want to assume. If if they're a sales REP they should have an out of office. Automatic response, but I didn't want to assume it was like. So I called someone else in the organization someone who's a different division and it was regarding another topic and I just said, oh, you know, I just want to make sure I have the correct email address for this one person i'm looking to to. propose a new instrument for this department, and you know, I just want to make sure I have the correct email it's been a week I left it at that I didn't say anything more than that. And it was regarding other topics, but I just wanted to make sure I have the correct email I just said, they said yes, the correct email address okay just just want to make sure I have the correct email just before I send another email, and so I left it at that, but."
724.0,Provider,Did you submit the other email.
12581.0,Patient,"I haven't yet, but I want to see how long this is going to go. busy with other things, and so it's not like it's urgent, but you know. Tomorrow i'm going to say friendly reminder, but I also want to add this to the email I didn't originally include this an email, but just for clarification. But I i've gotten, to the point where you know, I was talking to my a sponsor you know few hours ago i'm talking about you know it's like sometimes these people are just sick. And you don't treat a sick person, you know horribly so you just take some like okay."
724.0,Provider,that's a good point so I wrote.
12581.0,Patient,"I wrote is that guys okay he's excited you know, I was ready to go around this person, but okay something to think about I don't want to assume so something like this would just. know it, you know it did it still pisses me off, but it would send me to have a drink. But I don't have that urge to have a drink, so I just said Okay, even though i'm pissed off i'm not craving a drink, you know i'm. going to just find something to distract my mind and carefully think about my next plan of action rather than assuming and overreacting and i've gotten to a point where I would overreact and it wasn't like overreact like. I would get in this person's face and speak my mind and. wrote a fan of using profanity look pretty much. Like be calculating and try to make this person look bad, even though I don't need to make them look bad they make themselves look bad, but. Right that's the time when this person tried to make me look bad I just stayed calm we're talking about like in a meeting or they try to throw you under the bus. yeah he ended up making himself look bad, but I just stayed quiet, the entire time and thinking like okay Now I know that. you're trying to you know you're my hidden enemy and there was no remorse from his end, but I just said Okay, I was like I could just be calm and not overreact and I did that. But I was just like okay it's been two years since that incident and I don't know what I did to you know make you perceive me as your enemy, but."
724.0,Provider,"i'm trying to. Some people are like that, and like that that work environment they're always trying to get ahead trying to make themselves look good."
12581.0,Patient,"I think it's just the insecurity. But you know it's like I can overreact and make them give them a reason not to trust me or I could just do my job, and if."
724.0,Provider,"You could take the high road you could just be like because it's probably be like hey just following up with with email. Where we're at i'm you know any response would be appreciated if there's somebody else that I need to. If there's no department, whatever it is you take the high road you are still acting in a professional capacity, you don't want to get too shitty out an email because it's a permanent record."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah it's. yeah it's. I realized like you can't do, especially when you're in that moment of rage to not send emails out. right and it was and i've done that, before it wasn't like talking poorly about anyone I just said this contract that was negotiated is looking a little messed up. I said I just have some Intel from this organization and they have a secret contract with our competitor, and if we miss out on this opportunity I think it's going to really hurt our organization well that wasn't received well. yeah I heard, I heard from colleagues like you shouldn't have sent that email out not now upper management things you're a whiny little bench. Well backfired so it's snowballs and they blamed me anyway, so I just said, like. Give them Intel or have them blame me anyways and not give them until. At least I warned them. But I would cause like you shouldn't send anything negative you just quietly resign that's the the professionally quietly resign, even though they're going to blame you anyways but at least you come out walking looking professional. Right, so that was a hard lesson for me and so i'm I realized like I could just get even with this guy or I could just take the high road and. Follow the advice of people who pulled me aside earlier saying Okay, I know it's easy to to try to defend yourself, but sometimes you just have to walk away and look professional."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean yeah the high road, especially like in that setting because. i'd imagine that that community is somewhat chatty cathy's."
12581.0,Patient,So it yeah it is.
724.0,Provider,"To get out there, so like we always want to take you know road as much as it pains you much as you want to like leave there and start you know kicking kittens and stuff like that, like you just can't you know what I mean like you have a reputation a professional reputation to uphold."
12581.0,Patient,"I think i'm outside that arena now but i'm back out of a very high profile company and then these people who. pretty much like. cut me out of their network are now trying to weasel their way back in trying to get our business because i'm the only contact at this company that try to get business up, so I don't say anything I do like is like I know that was connected with them on linkedin. And all of us and I get a connection request from them like again wait a minute we were already connected and now you're connecting with me again."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
12581.0,Patient,"I just says like okay clearly you, you know you're trying to maintain your professional your reputation by Disconnecting from me. yeah right like pretty much like okay i'm fortunate to have this new. Job where i'm now. I would say now in a respectable position, but at the same time as like you know it's kind of toxic environment, the previous arena was pretty toxic, but I just say Okay, how can I still. regained my reputation and still work this in my favor. So it's pretty like talking to my husband says, I Okay, I just have to think of them as sick people. And you wouldn't want to treat a sick person poorly you know just try to help them out, maybe how help them regain a new perspective to. make them realize that they were sick to. begin with."
724.0,Provider,"that's a good universal precautions to live by you know what I mean like you know treat others how you want to be treated, despite the way that they treat you, you know what I mean like it's like the. Like like the Good Samaritan rule you know I always thinking that."
12581.0,Patient,"The point of enabling bad behavior but. know some of them yeah you don't want and that's a fine line like do you enable that behavior do you. So it's like how that happy medium, like okay let's try to to meet Idi. But at the same time, like I don't. condone this behavior and I did I did have colleagues that that were just toxic and I didn't. I didn't confront them I just said, you know what i'm I went above management is just a you know this behavior is you know I just said that I didn't say names I just said, I hear this conversation like who did we make cry today at the start of a meeting. And I just said, I was like I hope you're joking, when you say that because I don't think this is something called a behavior we should condone."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
12581.0,Patient,"I think everyone everyone in the organization deserves to be treated with respect. And when you when you hear about someone in the organization crying because of how they were treated by a colleague that's a red flag, I said, like that colleague quit and because that call it quit their work piled on the rest of us. And I just left it at that, as like we deserve to treat our colleagues with a certain level respect, even when they make mistakes right I just said crying is a red flag and he said Okay, I understand."
724.0,Provider,You know yeah by disrespecting one staff member and it gets to the point to where they leave because they feel that kind of way you especially disrespect all your staff members.
12581.0,Patient,"yeah and so several people did leave after that and I just said okay there's clearly something that isn't being addressed but i'm. not putting it that way, like they're sick people you wouldn't treat people poorly. I would. Try to help them out."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah what you would do your best. While maintaining healthy boundaries and healthy expectations, they don't have be obviously if the person is overtly disrespect like obviously you don't have to entertain that stuff."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah it's um. it's more like passive aggressive stuff. Right i've never been. But it like when it's a meeting and they're clearly throwing you under the bus it's like okay i'm just going to be calm and maybe there's some reason behind it, but i'm not going to assume. Maybe it'll come out in the open. Right and there's like I can't just overreact and make myself. get to this. confirm like maybe what they think they know about me and so or reaffirm or whatever. But so yeah I was just like i'm at that point where like clearly i'm upset but it's not, I would say the silver lining is it didn't trigger me to drink. Good so that's that's progress. Progress to work through my anger. Otherwise it's just going to eat me up inside and then get to that point where like I need a drink right but i've been silver that I sober tool is helping my family monitor me and."
724.0,Provider,You know.
12581.0,Patient,"Sometimes I do now, I got busy this morning and they got after me like why didn't you send your your result. And I said I got busy, I know I got I got this is okay we're now concerned. I understand, like so there after me, so I need that to get me, you know, on that."
724.0,Provider,stay on track.
12581.0,Patient,on track.
724.0,Provider,"Because look look at it's it's easy, the first 30 days of do this stuff because you're motivated now you're past that point. And now you're like it's kind of a pain in my ass so that I get to keep do because you think that you're solid you know what I mean you know you may have convinced yourself that you're solid, but you still need it, you know what I mean because. What 90 days for a habit, you know what I mean."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah and it's um and talking to my sponsor he says, you know you're you've you've kind of messed up your bank chemistry bye bye chronic drinking. And you know as long as you've been drinking that's how long your brain chemistry is going to get back to normal. So you know you're you're not thinking clearly he's like you said that you're you're mad about this. is maybe not as bad as you think it is it's just pretty much your brain chemistry is back on track and it's really insignificant like if you were back to your normal self. You may look back on this and say how insignificant, it is, but the little things like this are probably being exaggerated, by the way, you're drinking as fucked up your bank chemistry. Could pretty much like with them."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah they say people that that started start using drugs at picking age it's like that's where they're Richard you kind of stops. And that's where like their central executive function kind of stops I don't know if that's true I don't know i've never read any kind of literature or. been seeing that or its peer reviewed by scientists or anything I don't know that to a certain degree, it makes sense because you know if you're nervous at a certain point. You don't you don't start dealing with real life situations appropriately because you're already going into it with a level of impairment so it's not like you're. stone cold sober and you experience like life on life's terms, and then you adapt accordingly you're kind of doing it haphazardly so once you don't have that thing that caused all that distressed. yeah it would be very confusing for your brain to be like now, we don't want to get pissed off I just grab something to drink and not to worry about anything after that, like. You know I kind of tricked myself to the point where I forget that i'm cool you know, and I get my own problems now the deal is so. You know your default response is through a series of conditioning because that's all you know. You know, so the hard thing is. Getting past that and then, finally, an alternative practice and then doing that enough time so where that practice becomes. Your standard and the alcohol thing because the alternative default where you're just like that's what I used to do that's that's not going to help me now I just do some push ups or. You know I go to like a martial arts class or something like that and get that out, which I think you should probably look into like a like a physical outlet. You know if you didn't have other like anger stuff go into the gym is real helpful, but like putting your hands on something like punching a bag. You know, whatever it is like but martial arts, I think, is like crucial to like you know inner inner inner confidence and then like ego death so. I used to tell people like go and do like jujitsu and shit like that, because, like nothing will humble you like having like another man who's like half your size like struggle you, to the point of like unconsciousness. you're like oh my God I don't know anything so late, like by the time any of us ever left Jiu jitsu like there was like no rage or no anger like you'd come up like. You leave that shit at the door, then you come in, you do you, you know you go through your roles and you do your workout then when you leave you're like, why was I so angry you just like. like this, this nine year old came anyways half as much as I do he's ran circles on me tonight you're like. I got some stuff I got to work on, you know you really have something something like spiritual growth from experiences like that, not to say that you should go do jujitsu but, but something you need some kind of physical. Where you can't be hobbled you know at the feet and then, when you grow from those things it's like real crucial like. Anger will kill you it's very cancerous it's an irrational behavior it's very impulsive and you make real bad decisions when you're angry like that, like I struggle with. The whole reason I went to the martial arts and started doing jujitsu is because I got anger problems to me I don't like like it like I got this what you see here. And then, like 11 and like nothing in between, you know what I mean so like I needed something to help regulate. From this being like cool, calm collected like crazy like what like on the drop of a hat if I felt threatened or disrespected you like. You know I grew up in the city, I was always on edge military all that kind of stuff so it's like going in that stuff kind of really centers you it kind of like balance me out, you need some kind of escape for yourself. And for me, nothing beat jujitsu was like the best thing that ever did as far as like for me personally, it was like my drug of choice, and I would go there. injured not injured, you know do it, despite knowing that it was causing me significant physical harm and stuff but what I got out of it like it just that was like the drug that I always chased you know so. But it allowed me to get rid of, like some of the other stuff that was hanging over my head all the time that I was carried with me. So you need something that's going to help regulate that impulse."
12581.0,Patient,"To do. That. Since i've been with this new company for about a year now, they they just showed us show me where the gym is located and it's open now. You know they have all these classes available, and I just got to find a time of day that's that's gonna that's not going to interfere with work, but I think early in the morning is probably going to be fast. So yeah things are opening up and that that was the means they had a managing stress was just intense workouts. know just walk away just with the endorphin high and not like um yeah I don't remember drinking. Very at all when I was working out regularly."
724.0,Provider,yeah cuz you.
12581.0,Patient,"got I got every I you know got whatever steam was building up out of my system and um yeah I was. I would say my anger was never. By. threatening it was more like I would say is as bad as my anger would get what maybe I wouldn't even say, I would say right on the line of unprofessionalism not crossing it. You know, but enough for people to say okay. i'm."
724.0,Provider,he's getting there.
12581.0,Patient,I don't want to hang out with you you're like a debbie downer. Not like not like I don't trust you it's like oh you're a debbie downer.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I think I think a good goal for you, you know outside of you know you know working a program you know doing all that stuff doing your you know, like your family like regulation with that thing like I think you need to do something for you and I think the gym. Exercising at least like three to four times a week, would be an excellent outlet for you and then over time, once you started the benefit from like the work that you put in there's a good chance that. You wouldn't want to put anything into your body that's going to be a deterrent to what progress you've already made. You know, when people are like go to the gym and it sucks you know it sucks getting back into the gym it's hard and all that kind of stuff. But again, like anything else, once you start noticing change you start feeling better it's like yeah for sure i'm not going to want to eat a cheeseburger i've. been busted my ass all we got the air die, why do I want to. You know the gaming the progress that i've made for like a single cheeseburger so like little things like that will start to happen over time you'll start feeling better and the likelihood of you doing something. damaging to that is some type of enough to keep you on the straight and narrow, you know so having an outlet like that would be very beneficial if you have access to it, the only thing that's stopping you from going you and time management, but if you're clever guy you can."
12581.0,Patient,"figure out. This is this job is offering a a better routine, then, then the previous ones, where I was traveling a lot, and even then like you know I think the traveling was just an excuse, because every hotel has a gym."
724.0,Provider,"know, as I was, like, I was just thinking okay well i'm not home or not it's not my regular gym."
12581.0,Patient,"Right used as an excuse, and then there was like an keep in mind i'm still working so I was like oh it's just the i'll just go to the hotel room bust out my laptop and have a beer. Right, which is a bad idea right. just gone to the gym."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you're a workaholic too so there's a little bit of that what, if you could turn just a quarter of your work ethic and turn around and invested into yourself, you know what I mean, I think your headspace would clean up a whole lot. And just because you don't have access to like like a physical Jimmy where does it mean that you can't do some body weight mechanics some. Some sit ups and flutter kicks like there's so many like like you're walking around you're like you're your own personal gym like one of one of those things don't exist doesn't mean that you can't get down to like 15 push ups, you know. yeah do some jogging."
12581.0,Patient,"Or, and there was an APP I downloaded on my my phone it was, do you know bodyweight. Exercise workout routine it's different every day and it's like just one that you just take with you when you travel. yeah you know, and I downloaded it, but I never used it. Things that I said I would do and. I think. When there's just so much change going on it's just hard to get focused on one simple healthy change. Right like constant change and it's like okay it's now's not the time to start I convinced myself that now is not the time to start adopting a healthy habit because there's wait for things to settle down and then."
724.0,Provider,there's always gonna be.
12581.0,Patient,"So much time goes by, and nothing changes like it's just constant change, and I was like Okay, I am waiting for something to be consistent and it's never going to happen so it's making that effort to find something consistent when everything else is chaos yeah."
724.0,Provider,"there's always going to be something else down the road that's holding you back. that's why it's important to like live in the present like realistically like like little things like this, like. Having the gym APP that's cool, but if you don't use it that's a pain in the ass because you're literally walk it's like it never leaves your side it's right there on every and really what it's asking you to do is commit like 15 minutes of your time to yourself and you're so. selfish with everything else but yourself and what I mean like you're willing to. To bust your ass for work you're willing to do all these commitments for your family but you're not willing to spend any time on yourself, for whatever reason, that might be. right because there's always something else for you to be doing that you should be doing and it's like, no, no, you could take. A portion of your day dedicated to yourself reinvest that type of energy and a better yourself and that may be you perform all those tasks that you're required to do anyways. But more efficiently with a clear head and a better conscience that you get the all the work done in half the amount of time and you're not stressed out about it, like why wouldn't you want to take advantage of. Something like that you know what I mean it seems like a good a good investment if you have like a bunch of money it's like I could put in 30 minutes a day. It doesn't have to be 30 minutes of a Rhodes it's like 15 minutes here when I wake up, I firstly the more I get up at ease of bodyweight squats. You don't think it like people in jail and stuff they're all rip they don't have access to the gyms are all just doing bodyweight stuff get up to like 15 push ups through a couple of air squats really. You know, get the blood going get the get the dope amigo the oxy to get it all working on your blood going alright cool. Get all your day when you get home from work like i'm really tired don't sit down go straight into a workout dad earn earn the right to sit down and relax. You know, and when you do that by is going to feel great you eat food putting clean energy and getting clean energy out like you just start to feel better like nothing beats depression. You know, especially if it's like work related pressure, you know the day to day stresses of life, like like a clean exercise like it really doesn't really clears things up conscience like snacks on that fogbank off, you know, and then you can."
12581.0,Patient,"um so yeah the January is when things are opening up all over work price they'll be more like exercise classes. More people interact with but yeah i'd say. it's new with new year comes new year's resolutions and. Worse, and."
724.0,Provider,"sort of way up you know lots of people there towel and they're they're fresh care like like skincare and sneakers and they're ready to go like. getting into the gym socks at the beginning, but if you stick with it long enough, it starts to benefit you like it's one of the best things and then after that just about maidens you know what I mean. yeah getting in there, getting the bait that stone staying on top of it once you start to look better you feel better you know what I mean like I used to work with a guy who used to. When it came time to get like a new uniform or a boss like super stingy with the uniforms he'd go up to him and be like you know what he's like I don't feel good. And the boss is like why there's like because I look like shit and he's like he's like really my shirts all faded I got holes in it. And you won't give me a new shirt he was like it's kind of crazy us like you know what I know I know that when I look good feel good it was just do stuff like that, and the dude like Jesus here's a shirt he was like good and he get it like you know the next day come into the be like. yeah he's like what you look good you feel good man it's like all those guys wear fancy suits all day and it's like. The difference between a guy who's wearing a suit that's not Taylor and the guy that's wearing a suit that is tailored it's like, why does he what does he have all that confidence it's like. he's got a tailored suit on he feels shit hot he feels good like you know I mean it's like whatever gets thrown at me today, like, I still feel good, like everything fits like all the right areas, you know what I mean so when you look good you feel good it same thing with the gym like. that's what I have mirrors everywhere in the gym you know what I mean, so you could like bought it to your progress you're like oh shit I didn't know I had it like that it's like motivates you to keep working you know what I mean."
12581.0,Patient,"And i'd say when I when I was doing crossfit like religiously that was I could have a bad day, but I was like you know what I. I killed this workout, even though the day was shitty there, this is probably something good that I feel I have something I felt good about and I killed this record, even though the rest of the day was shitty like something, something I did today, I feel good about and so. And you don't do."
724.0,Provider,You know what to be here for a.
12581.0,Patient,lawyer yeah.
724.0,Provider,"And that's how you should look at the today and it's like what was shitty about your day you use the word portion your day was shitty. You know everybody's work days shipping, you know what I mean like that that's that's part of it it's like, but if all the things that you did for yourself or good yeah it don't matter of how bad work was you know at that point."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah it's um. You know, I was told to write a list of things to do and it's not like. mean that things for me, but it's just things to do, like be productive that's outside of work. yeah but it's like. But I should put something in there that's for myself not like household chores like what did I do today for myself. yeah probably put that in the list every day. Make sure that I check that off even if other things aren't checked off. You guys want. You know, sitting watching TV yeah."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean checking a box for watching netflix at the end of day you're like at the end of the week you're like I did a lot this week I watch netflix a lot and then you're like.
12581.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You know that one hour, you know watching netflix for three hours of i'd spent 30 minutes doing something else I still would have gotten two and a half hours worth of netflix and at least 30 minutes or something that benefited me directly, you know yeah. I think checking boxes are poor and i'm sure we've talked about the importance of being task oriented. You know, you know for guys we'd like to see an end result, we have to start a project and we like to see it through you know we get a lot of reward out of that that's like the. hunter gatherer mentalities that we have in our DNA like we'd like hunting we like going places and accomplishing a task for the greater good that's why. You know that's why we excel at work and we'll put it in the long hours and all the bullshit but there's got to be like a positive outcome that we could see, but if you're not getting that at work that you need to get that someplace else you know, for you for your own. yeah like that's that's why it's important you know it's easy for us to sit around and not do anything because it's convenient you know just take a lot of energy but. sure you have a decent amount of energy just waiting to get out maybe getting back in the crossfit would probably could be one of the best things you do for yourself this year."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah it's um yeah I have to, I think that Jim has the company gemma's crossfit like classes and I think with the Community it's going to be a challenge, but if if they have a variety of classes i'm sure i'll find something that's similar to it."
724.0,Provider,"What would what would be a challenge, though."
12581.0,Patient,"what's the challenge, because I have to get up at five o'clock to take the bus. So I take a backseat to hour and a half. bus ride. to and from so it's like a. There isn't anything nearby because it's in a. it's in an. area where there's all these pharma and biotech companies, but no gyms like crossfit gyms nearby."
724.0,Provider,So watch a bunch of squares and.
12581.0,Patient,kind of isolated yeah this this it's an industrial area.
724.0,Provider,Okay.
12581.0,Patient,"So there there's very few maybe there's like a few like chain restaurants, but nothing more than that it's like just office buildings and. You know these office buildings like companies have their own gyms inside but not like crossfit that's really nearby so but I have courses in the in the gym that are crossfit like."
724.0,Provider,or like hey at high intensity and.
12581.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So hey man, it sounds like a good like a business opportunity if there are no crossfit gyms in this park like Maybe I should tell the crossfit gym there."
12581.0,Patient,"ya know I know that the some people thought about that idea. No, I don't know if I don't know if the pandemic ruin those plans are. closed their business but i'm sure they'll start opening up a again as people adapt to going back to work and trying to manage this work life balance that that existed before the pandemic."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah right so yeah I think that would be an excellent goal for you, you know for the new year, you know getting get into the gym. Because I know you got it like that, there are a lot of people that do crossfit had a good time and if you did cross what you liked it, that means that you're you're a special kind of person right, so you know Castle it's not for everybody it's definitely not for everybody."
12581.0,Patient,seven days a week that's how. Much I was into it and I maybe it's the addictive personality.
724.0,Provider,"Working out is very addictive, it does those."
12581.0,Patient,"I would probably do something else, like drink."
724.0,Provider,So yeah I think if you got back to that you know you'd be in a better place.
12581.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"And something or do. one more tool to put into your toolbox to help you get get to where you need to be um. So the other night when you logged in I don't know, can you see, but I sent you like, a message in the chat was."
12581.0,Patient,"I thought leaders so you'll be in shortly, and then I just waited and then it just said that you left the meeting and I thought, maybe I was bumped out. hello, and so I dial back in, and it was just processing. Really, then I contacted by our health is like Okay, maybe there's connection issues. And I said Okay, it was like maybe maybe it's best if we just reschedule. So I did get the message it should have replied back I don't know but yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Because, because I got told. That from somebody completely different they're like yeah you like when when people are like in your waiting room when you're in a zoom meeting like they can't see that message, based on their screen and I was like what I was like I hope that's not the. case that way, like a lot, I never get responses back, but I do that because nothing ever ends on time, like in these sessions and I. I tried to like when I make my point is like, if you notice what I always do like 15 minutes like after the hour so it'll be it's never like. Right at the hour i'm like 715 like after my groups I have you know sessions like you know if they had their way, you know, I have a group at four and and they would have me have a session at five it's like. You know groups never finish on time you got 20 people talking like never nothing ever finishes on time, if you have a crisis like that person that follows a group. Ensure to get shafted so I make it a point that anybody that follows my group are like 15 minutes after the hour. And I personally do like by the visual sessions now or schedule people 15 minutes after the hour, because if things run law or whatever it is like I need that. Like that time as a buffer because somebody might be like like going through some like real stuff I can't be like all right times up sorry bro like. Stop I don't like that you know I prefer to keep the aggregate out, so I do communicate with people like through that text, I was like I hope. that's not the case man because it's like I kind of rely on that they like get the message out to people like literally i'll be right there i'm just wrapping up or."
12581.0,Patient,"You know yeah I was, I was thinking you know, I was like well, maybe there's a connection issue but. Also thinking, maybe he's dealing with the more serious like I i'm fine like just to let you know i'm like i'm not in crisis situation, but I was thinking, maybe he's on he's talking to someone who's in a crisis moment, and you know it's okay if we reschedule I just."
724.0,Provider,"mean the possibility for that to happen on any session like is there, you know, but by and large, all. yeah biologic it's that bad we try to resolve it before. You know, like before the end if that makes sense, like I would I never want to leave somebody in crisis and the guy times up bro gotta go gotta go like. So yeah normally you'll go right out of the gate if it's going to be like one of those sessions, where you're like okay Okay, and if you. If I haven't gotten resolve within that hour then i'll probably not going to get it resolved."
12581.0,Patient,"Like okay. yeah I got. I got the message I should have replied back, but then I got bumped out, and I was like maybe there's connection issues or there's like Okay, the crisis situation. So."
724.0,Provider,"You know i'm not sure I. So I mean I did end the video because it, you know as you could tell this is recording so what you never want to do is have somebody else come in, after one person left and keep the recording going because that means that both your. records like birds and that that's like a hospitality hospital porter pet like portability issue Hippo that kind of stuff you've never want that, so I hit the STOP recording but I never closed my zoom down. And I just left it open, and I would readmit you theoretically, and I would hit record and then it would start the new thing. But that didn't happen, for whatever reason. So I thought, maybe like like the message thing wasn't working so I was like oh Christ there we go so i'm glad that you everything kind of got sorted out, and if you did see it that's good So whoever told me that says."
12581.0,Patient,yeah no I should have responded back I just thought that there was connection issues so yeah next time that happens all will communicate through.
724.0,Provider,Data yeah.
12581.0,Patient,"Okay yeah but it wasn't like Okay, we can schedule."
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that works oh uh let's look at your chart little bit of reviewing your surveys surveys, you did earlier in the week. Your pH Q nine in right the minimal that's the depressed mood one. yep minimal one one point out of a possible 21 I believe so that's pretty good so you're good there your anxiety one he scored a. Minimal so busa eggs, all the way across that's good snow, so no depression, anxiety, the past two weeks."
12581.0,Patient,"Now good. idea, I think that was that's been bothering me is that email that I sent out like not right now to reply, but I was like that's just kind of like in the back of my mind, but it's not like."
724.0,Provider,Well there's underlying yeah there's an underlying stuff attached that that's one.
12581.0,Patient,"factor but it's not like yeah i'm still able to work and get stuff done it's just um. I would say it's like. yeah just Okay, a little annoyed just that but it's. Not i'm not drinking so it's."
724.0,Provider,"yeah well, we got to reframe like that thought process, you know what I mean like that can't be like your."
12581.0,Patient,"I gotta move past that negativity. And so I think that that. That perspective okay they're just sick people. yeah I was saying, you know I wouldn't expect people meet me again my my low point you know with the withdrawals, where I was feeling really bad about myself, you know I wouldn't be shitty of people like treating me poorly in my my. My mental state, so you know if you just see them as sick people like okay you wouldn't treat them treat them how you want to be treated, if you are sick so put things in perspective."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I tend to I tend to think that maybe they, for whatever reason be like be like I don't know what's going on with them. Like maybe maybe they're being the fairies and if that's the case that sucks to be that you know, like it's like maybe they didn't see the message, maybe that computer screwed up be like I don't know, but the initial reaction that. You it's not a frustration, because you have another life history with this person so you're like oh OK OK, I see what you're doing here, I could reply back to you going to be that guy. That you were in those meetings aren't but that's really maybe that's the case you know if it was it's definitely not benefiting him professionally to back it back to your emails if you kind of if your company is trying to generate. some kind of body, you know what I mean so like whatever he's doing he's not being smart about it and that'll come out in the wash if that's the case or maybe something genuine did happen, maybe he's away from the dead, whatever it is like we just don't know. And I would I would hope that if it was somebody. If it wasn't this guy that you had an email, you probably want to be this upset if you hadn't got a response back in a week you just like okay. They just haven't replied back it's really not that high on my priority right now, because you said that earlier but I gotta build email me back when they do, but it's because it's this guy. you're pissed off about it it's not really it's got nothing to do at work it's got your it's got everything to do with your relationship with this guy you're like Okay, I see what you're gonna be you're gonna be that guy so to give you got past that I just."
12581.0,Patient,"I think I just gotta. I think I would be if I just learned by like that be vindictive about it, I would probably be disappointed myself down the road. Later I would look back, I was like you know I probably shouldn't have done that so it's i'm. Right now i'm just processing is OK, but that that whole perspective, like he's just SEC, and you wouldn't treat. A person like shit. Yes, okay. Perfect so."
724.0,Provider,"it's definitely it's a that's a good like I said earlier, it's a good universal. precautions to take I think it's the same way that I tell patients where it's like you know people that are dealing with like like opiate dependency and addiction stuff like that. And i'm like yeah but I know what i'm getting you know I know the heroin i'm getting i'm like okay i'm just going to say this because I have to so. A universal precautions be treat everything that you get as fentanyl. Because finals I think that's out there and it's killing everybody just assume that what you're getting has spent a lot it. And then maybe that when you think of it that way, maybe you be a little bit more cautious maybe you'll take less maybe you'll just whatever it is, but maybe I plant that seed I do the same thing with like universal records like. To me, everybody that I see, on the other, street. Sometimes, potentially, you might have a weapon autumn so maybe I won't get crazy and my car when they cut me off, you know what I mean so like like. It where i'm from in Rhode island like it's really hard to have a concealed firearm. At least, when I was growing up so Road rage was, like all the rage, you could totally say things to people and not have any like real major recourse well. When I was in Florida, I had that mentality, I was like 22 somebody caught me off, and I got brave and bold in and send some things that I shouldn't have and the dude was like. And I was like oh. You know I got complacent I didn't know where I was at so I don't do that stuff anymore, as much as I want to just like off the cuff, you know, like, I talked about earlier like I can go from zero to 11. You know, in a second I was like i've learned this scale back some of that intensity like by universal precautions taught me that everybody potentially has that so meet them where they're at they cut me off, maybe. My vision, I just gonna be maybe they were in a rush they got something else going on that's more important than what I got going on, so i'm just like okay."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah that reminds me of the incident, it was like when I was probably. i'm probably at the peak of the stress, I was dealing with was just yelling on a daily basis from a manager and. customers and colleagues were I guess i'd be I became emotionally detached. And so it was late at night, and I was like I need to get some sleep and I was going to go buy some over the counter meds. So it's late at night but walgreens and there's like no one in the parking lot except a few cars. So I see someone moving and the car that's parked next to me and I kind of lean forward and and the guy leaned support and I thought he was saying something like maybe it's walgreens is closed, so I just kept looking and and I get out of the car he gets in my face. He says you gotta fucking problem like it looks shady sketchy. I had no fear whatsoever and I realized something's wrong with me like normally it would scare the shit out of me like this guy can have a guy. And I. But I realized being yelled at daily just I just became emotionally detached and. These people who show anger and aggression. they're probably in that same situation where they're just so detached and have no fear of the consequences."
724.0,Provider,"Right, because that situations like anyone can just be set off and not."
12581.0,Patient,"Have any think nothing about the repercussions about what they're getting into and. As you know, as I said, they're sick I was sick."
724.0,Provider,"yep I was sick I learned my lesson. taught me a lot, I had to learn a lot for out of life from that those experiences and I got more from that than I did like being deployed overseas. I was still a kid when all that stuff happened, I still had like that energy it wasn't until much later in life when I started doing that was like oh man I got. I got some other like stuff that I need to kind of like work out and get through and evolve, you know as a person, and I did all that stuff you know what I mean. There are there, like milestones just like kids have milestones like when they grow up you don't stop. evolving as like a it's like a human being, just as an adult we feel like it takes longer because we're so stuck in our ways, but you are it's it's progressive in nature, it takes a while. And then you have like these, these defining moments in life, where you're like good bad or indifferent, they are still defining what you do is never the same. You know what I mean like you're not that person, you were up until that moment, you know you're altered in some kind of way and then just move forward and then that's why like, would you be like like super old timers and stuff like that, like for sure, like. I don't know pick something like your grandfather, the way that your grandfather is is probably not the same way, he was when he was like your age, you know I mean so it's like you're meeting somebody who's. At the end of like their life cycle and they've gone through the entire gambit of all of it you're like damn I wonder what you must have been like when you were 20 but you were like a. savage or whatever it was invited me but they grow and grow and they grow, they grow into the first and only you aren't so you'd like you run your course so."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah he was he was a war that my grandfather was a war veteran and he was a nice gentle grandfather, but everyone who knew him when he was younger, he said that he didn't come back from the war, the same so he was mean it was resentful. Exactly yeah strict Is that not the grandfather I know he's like Well he changed. yeah James like he's like he. made peace with everything, and you know so it's just yeah and it's interesting because it's right at the age where I am. yeah where he changed no yeah."
724.0,Provider,"So yeah you'll keep doing that because eventually to light like you're going to have suffered like enough life altering experience like. Events where you're going to be like the things that you hold as priorities right now you're not going to at some point you're just gonna be like it's not that important you know I mean like I can't wait for you to get to the point and in your life, where you're like it's just work."
12581.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's it's what I gotta do to make sure my bills or pay my be like my my means are men it's like this work. All this other extra shit that I do is like super exciting and like I have fought it i'm happy to do, and all that stuff like like it's again a lot of talk about work is this work like. It pays the bills and stuff but it'd be getting you know I mean we're like we're so purpose driven that we're we're. Our identity is is attached to our employment so often."
12581.0,Patient,"i've worked with some very hostile people but. You know and it's just like you take it personal after a while it gets under your skin but, but if maybe if I did you jitsu and had someone had if someone had me in a headlock maybe they're screaming and yelling wouldn't be so offensive compared with the headlock."
724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah cuz anyway, like I said."
12581.0,Patient,From a headlock but you're screaming and yelling isn't so so bad.
724.0,Provider,yeah bye.
12581.0,Patient,birdie Nice.
724.0,Provider,"it's like oh man like I you know I get choked to death for fun, you know what are you gonna do you know it'd be like it's like a weird thing, like my. Like my coach my first coach he was like a like a sheriff's deputy at all. He was a real cool and he, like Friday night you guys are gonna go out to the clubs you're going to meet some girls that they'll probably going to have boyfriends you know, and he was like. it's all right he's like they might want to fight you he's like. he's like hopefully they don't they don't know jujitsu better than you he's like the chances are. that's going to be their first fight that they've had in several years he was like that, if you come here three four nights a week and you average four or five rolls. Class he's like you bet in 20 fights before Friday night that was just this week, he was like so I feel pity for those guys, you know it's like, but most of the time you're like Okay, but he's like but don't go out looking for fights he's like fights will find you, you know and he's like. So just don't be that yeah, but when you get to like to that point where more often than not like. Now that I know how to like full people up with like their clothes like laundry it's just like I don't have the urge to do that the people you know what I really like and i've had like. Situations it like in corrections when I was there and working in the hospital, where I had people like. Get crazy with me i'm like Okay, I mean I could just showed you on conscious with your shirt, if you like, but you know, like we don't have to do that and. You just very calm, like you, just like calm and in front of chaos you're like it's not that serious bro like you can relax like we don't have to get it. crazy here, everything is cool like the escalations like it's fun getting like that that's fun, but it's not practical like somebody's gonna get hurt it's not going to be made so. You know you don't want to do that so yeah it'll change your like your perspective on a lot of things like like life events will do that to you. And you'll get to that point to and you're already, probably at that point to where now like you're not letting work it to you as much as you used to and that's what you kind of have to use as like a better for measurement."
12581.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's. You know i've had several people give me a different perspective I wasn't in that mindset to let it sink in. it's it's sinking in just took time. we're just maybe it's not maybe it's just they are Maybe other people already said it, but it was just not put in a way, where I could understand it understand it so."
724.0,Provider,yep oh you weren't ready to hear it.
12581.0,Patient,You know I mean so maybe. Maybe yeah maybe I just didn't want to hear it. But it's sinking now so just hearing that okay they're sick now now i'm like okay i'll just let things move its course without being vindictive.
724.0,Provider,Right yeah.
12581.0,Patient,Well down the road.
724.0,Provider,"You know and don't let those people have control over you, you know what I mean like like they're like that behaviors to them. And with this guy particular he's probably not doing anything, above and beyond, but just not replying to an email he's like that's easy, but like I forgot even said that they like he's like he. he's occupying free real estate in your head and he's not even trying, you know what I mean he's but. That might not even be the game, like the dude might be out on covert for all you know you don't like you know what I mean so it's like who knows what's going on, but for you like. You know it's like all these politicians and stuff like that Donald trump they're still talking about Donald trump like. whoa boy last man like he is it he. is not an office you don't have a Twitter he's not talking anymore like you already you don't hear from this guy. But he's still occupy so much real estate, like all these people's heads that it's like yo man is he's charging you read right now it's like. So yeah the idea of just you know, like your buddy said, like maybe sick maybe it's not maybe truly is sick and we don't know so you know we don't know what we don't know so. don't. don't want to occupy that space he hasn't earned it, you know what I mean."
12581.0,Patient,yeah it's. yep he hasn't earned it.
724.0,Provider,"hasn't earned it so. just keep moving forward. Alright, so let me schedule up for the second part of the summer, unless you already have an appointment."

12581.0,Patient,yeah I think it.
724.0,Provider,would help. help improve your mental health if that helps you decompress of that stress and give you an outlet for some of that anger frustration that you have.
