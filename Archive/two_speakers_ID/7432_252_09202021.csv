252.0,Provider,yeah long time and sobriety you know you got a lot.
7432.0,Patient,"And there's no reason, I do have to mention one thing real quick I don't know how to like. Like I feel like i'm gonna be one of the people who like needs to be on suboxone for like maybe even possibly the rest of my life. And I was trying to talk to my husband about it because, like. with him starting his own company i'm worried. about health insurance, of course, you know and having to pay for everything, because i've already what's happened to me in the past is I lose my health insurance and I relapse because everything it's taken from me all at once. yeah you know. And he had said something. Oh no What did he say. He said well why don't you just cut down, I know you can do it and, of course, there was like a look of. He said there was like a look scared look on my face when he said that and i'm like well it's not just that it's the fact that you know, every time I stopped suboxone I relapsed. And he's like every time i'm like do I have to explain this to you again like i've already told you, you know when you've been there when it happened. And I was like well. What if i'm one of those people who is on it for the rest of my life and he's like no you won't be you can stop. he's like don't you want better for yourself."
252.0,Provider,how'd that feel.
7432.0,Patient,"Like i'm just like are you serious. It kind of hurt because. Well, the other thing is, when I decided to get back on the suboxone. He didn't know and you saw the time I was still taking pills every once in a while, because I was struggling. And when I told him i'm going to go back to the suboxone clinic and he said Oh, you are, and I said. Yes, I am like this isn't you're not going to tell me i'm, not because I am This is my choice my recovery my choice I need help again. And he was taken back at that, but I don't know I just because he was like well don't you want to spend our money on other stuff and i'm like well if it was important to you wouldn't it be okay."
252.0,Provider,"yeah well and he probably you know doesn't know that there are people that need it long term, you know, there are some."
7432.0,Patient,"that's just a friend of his actually a very good friend of his that he worked with for a long time he didn't even know was on suboxone until one day they were in the van and. He he stepped on a pack, and he was like oh my God dude is that yours and Mike was like no that's not mine my husband's like oh dude i'm so sorry he thought he it stuck tone from the House. You know and he's like dude i'm so sorry about that well Mike finally came clean and my husband about it and it it's taken I mean he was on it for 10 years I mean it's longer than that now, before he was finally down to a four milligram. mm hmm and i'm just like well you know, like. I don't know. I like when other people he's okay."
252.0,Provider,"Well, how many milligrams are you on."
7432.0,Patient,"i'm on 24, which is still a lot."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
7432.0,Patient,"So also I feel like he also doesn't understand like it helps with my pain, no it doesn't help with my teeth pain. as much. Because that's you know something I need to take care of their infected they're broken, I need to have them pulled, but I have chronic back pain, because I have degenerative disc in my back, and I have a bad back it does help with that. And I don't think he understands that because it's just I don't I don't know."
252.0,Provider,If you ever been on suboxone.
7432.0,Patient,"No, he does not like pills, he does not take he won't even take anything because of me."
252.0,Provider,"well. You know a lot of people are on suboxone for pain management. A lot of people. Since that's the alternative to any kind of. oxy or tramadol or whatever. You know. And having that conversation, you know, with him, maybe. Having a conversation with him and married."
7432.0,Patient,yeah you know.
252.0,Provider,"Maybe he could ask them questions, and you know get some information that might help them understand. that's what I would suggest you know. Get the facts."
7432.0,Patient,"yeah I couldn't do some research to and fill on my guest. Yes, like literally you like he's seen. you've seen this on. The top of my bottle for my suboxone. And he likes me that's just an opioid to. Because that's on my soapbox and i'm like well it's not like the other upper you're talking about."
252.0,Provider,Now.
7432.0,Patient,"So I don't know sister. it's hard, because his mom was an addict and she died, you know and. My mom's an addict and that's pretty much probably meant to but."
252.0,Provider,"Well errands. Gathering some information talking to Mary you know, asking if she'd be willing to meet with you in him and give him some information on it medical information piece on it asked him if he's willing to meet with you and Mary."
7432.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,And to help you em figure it out and understand where you're at you know what I mean you're in a great place it's almost like saying if it's not broke don't fix it.
7432.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know that.
7432.0,Patient,My girls understand yeah.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
7432.0,Patient,"But. Okay i'm almost done okay make them come in. don't let them. don't let them do that because he's trying to dominate you owe her dog. He tried to my God or he tried to help my daughter, the other day. She was sitting there, and he, like tried to mount her and she was like no, you know, and he tried to do it again and now she's outside trying to work out and he's trying to do it again."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
7432.0,Patient,"Trying to dominate you list like you've got to tell him no like that's not, as I understand, like he's my daughter's dog, but she does not she's like the oh baby like not the. This yeah and. that's why I can't watch hutson here. I have to watch him over at their house till he gets bigger because he jumps and he you know, like they brought him over yesterday, for the first time, and he freaked out, he was. Running circles and trying to jump on my brother and it's like yeah like haley you have to and then she gets mad at us when we try to do it. And it's frustrating."
252.0,Provider,What about obedience class.
7432.0,Patient,"that's what I told her she's gonna look into it, because he's got to do something like he's good. Except for when people come over he wants to jump on them, and he does the same thing to rowan and he knocks them over every time around comes over, we have to pick him up until until he comes down that all comes down."
252.0,Provider,"yeah I would say in obedience class, and you know I noticed that is a pickle pickle has one."
7432.0,Patient,"yeah but it's not the same as like. it's like teaching them to sit and stay, I guess, not like a. Disciplinary for certain actions I guess you would call it. yeah we have a couple encounter that I heard her pretty good, so I told her, she needed to."
252.0,Provider,look into it.
7432.0,Patient,yeah cuz that's ridiculous like I can't even have people come over that because they don't want to be jumped on yeah.

7432.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean that's the whole reason we don't go over to my cousin's House you know I mean her dog is huge and I won't go over there anymore, because my grandma's over there. And she always complains you never come visit me and my grandma because that dog i've already witnessed him take you down once because you're trying to pull him back from jumping on other people and he's gonna hurt you badly like he is like 100 pound huge dog."
