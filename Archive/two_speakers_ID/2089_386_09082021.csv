2089.0,Patient,i'm not real sure I think it's the.
386.0,Provider,"Northern buprenorphine okay usually it is and that's why I just wanted, but it's written as suboxone so I just wanted to be sure here don't want to send in a wrong bed once we get to that point. Swiss sure and. Writing and so looking at everything here, it looks like here, you had been you missed the appointment for the bps evaluation on the third of September, and then you also missed the appointment for group on the seventh of September. But you said you were in jail. Yes, how long were you in jail for."
2089.0,Patient,What was it. I think it was Tuesday Tuesday.
386.0,Provider,Tuesday Tuesday.
2089.0,Patient,yeah I got out early yesterday or late yesterday evening.
386.0,Provider,Already when was your last dose of medication.
2089.0,Patient,i'm actually yesterday.
386.0,Provider,"Last dose was yesterday, approximately morning after noon."
2089.0,Patient,Time mark.
386.0,Provider,978 and are you currently experiencing any type of withdrawal symptoms.
2089.0,Patient,may not feel rough that's all.
386.0,Provider,When you say so rough like.
2089.0,Patient,Any like sweating energy.
386.0,Provider,fatigue hired. Any sweating.
2089.0,Patient,I always do that.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, with. About nausea vomiting no okay perfect. Have you used any illicit substances opioids or anything illicit over the counter that's not currently prescribed. yeah no relapse. Perfect already so right now looking at your chart you currently are enrolled in our program and you are suggested to be seen, once a week. With the suggested individual therapy appointment to be twice a month, they can't get you scheduled for individual therapy until that bps evaluation is. completed, however, they do have you scheduled on the 30th for peer support Okay, so what I would recommend at this point, your appointment is scheduled for the 14th so next Tuesday. So, for your group, but what I would do after we're finished here I would definitely recommend logging into the care navigators virtual clinic. To get scheduled for rescheduled that bps evaluation otherwise is your prescriptions already been reduced. Right now, the recommendations to reduce it down to a two day supply, with no additional refills so what I can do is I can get the two day supply out for you, however. it'll be a two day supply without any refills and then what I would do is, I will just continue to bridge you up until we can get you seen by either individual therapy or group first so you'll have to log into the rx. Virtual clinic so the the room that you were just in prior to this one. You would just log into that every you know, on the third day just to continue to get bridge prescriptions, but they won't Bridget if we don't see any appointment."
2089.0,Patient,Upcoming good.
386.0,Provider,"So just definitely need to make sure that we get individual therapy or your PPs evaluation Scott told Okay, it looks like here your last appointment on that you had completed it looks like it was on 831 of 2021 and that was for group so other than that other than not being seen. You have everything working for you right now, at this point in time we just want to make sure that we get everything aligned okay."
2089.0,Patient,"Lady to move for me, she just she didn't tell me done like as she just told me that they would give me medicine until Monday, then she says she may be an appointment for Monday at 10 o'clock."
386.0,Provider,"So we are currently in communication with the other team, just to make sure that the standard of care is completed through out that way you're not given false information because technically. they're not supposed to guarantee any type of medication renewals if you haven't been seen you've been seeing within the 30 days, but if you have if you're not seeing within 30 days, then it goes into discharge and we don't. We don't prescribe so you know there were working on communication skills to be able to you know, report back to the patients appropriately of what's going to be done. But in terms of prescription bridging what's been recommended at this point in time is a two day script no refills and then just, we have to make sure we bridge those two days out until you're seeing next. And then until you see by the prescribing physician, at least, and then looking at everything I have Dr sell it or I can today is your preferred as you're prescribing physician and. Did you come."
2089.0,Patient,out like it opens you.

2089.0,Patient,The three years old. Are ya know about it.
386.0,Provider,"Perfect if if suboxone it's not covering you for that pain and then you can always I always recommend epson salt baths. I don't know if you have a bath but getting a little bit of Epsom salt read the instructions on there and then so can like a almost like a Luke warm bath. The epson salt helps go into that muscle and it relaxes the muscles a little bit for you, so you don't have to so many aches and pains okay. And then, are you using stimulants currently."
