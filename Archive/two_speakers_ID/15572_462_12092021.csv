462.0,Provider,ashlyn. whoops hold on one second. hear me.
15572.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, good um. How are you."
15572.0,Patient,Good how are you.
462.0,Provider,"i'm doing good Thank you. yeah so obviously we met and had the initial intake appointment, and this is your first therapy appointment, so I just wanted to. open it up and see if there's anything that you wanted to talk about in particular first maybe some of your biggest strengths challenges anything going on with you right now."
15572.0,Patient,um. One of my big battles. Is.
462.0,Provider,"Your frozen i'm having a really tough time hearing you. whoops Okay, I can see you again, but I couldn't hear what you were saying you were frozen."
15572.0,Patient,"i'm. Just that I have to. Make it, so I can keep up with everything that I need to do. Like. right down to being worked on time. i'm just. crazy I procrastinate a lot and I don't know why."
462.0,Provider,Okay yeah Well that is definitely a part of having a dd common symptom is procrastination and just kind of fighting to keep up.
15572.0,Patient,yeah I feel like i'm behind everybody I feel like everybody's way ahead of me.
462.0,Provider,"Okay So what does a typical day look like, for you."
15572.0,Patient,"And usually I wake up at about 230. To be the word fight for. And I wake up in a bad mood. or. later. snooze 20 times. And then I I bring down sometimes before you go to work well, because my mornings, already been rough and then I have to come home and take care of a two year old so. which I love I wouldn't trade that for the world but. Of course yeah."
462.0,Provider,yeah but it's a lot of stress and it's a tough wake up time so do you have any type of self care that you do any hobbies anything you like to do for fun that just kind of give back to you and make you feel more connected and better.
15572.0,Patient,"um most of the time I do stuff with my daughter, to make you feel better honestly like my life or and we're pretty much I don't really do anything for myself anymore."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so. That might be a place to start is just trying to find some things that you can do for yourself just to feel a little bit more connected and maybe start working on that waking up in a bad mood thing. A lot of times. When you wake up in a bad mood the day can just kind of spiral, and then you're running late and everything, so it can be helpful to try to kind of wake up. Even though you're not going to have much time, but just take a deep breath and even say like I don't know a positive affirmation for the day or something to just kind of. bring it around to the best place possible, even though again, that is a very early wake up time and that is not easy."
15572.0,Patient,No it's not.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so it could be a start just trying to figure out what self care could look like, for you do you have any ideas of how you could start to get back to doing some things just for you."
15572.0,Patient,"make myself Liz. I tried that for a little while, and it was working. I don't really know anything else, I mean I put a lot of stuff in my phone, because I do everything on my phone. And I have a little note section on my phone that's usually where I make lists. Just or set alarms for like a week straight at it so it's already set or not hit the snooze button so many times."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you're that lists are a really good start, so do you have a calendar and some notebooks that help you stay a little bit organize."
15572.0,Patient,I do actually have a calendar thing here on the wall that has the calendar and then it has what do I need just a little other section or.
462.0,Provider,"Well that's good that's a good foundation that you have so. You know, you said you kind of feel like you're always trying to keep up always behind other people. And well first you shouldn't necessarily compare yourself to other people, but maybe trying to just. kind of get reacquainted with yourself could be a start, because you're giving so much for work you're giving so much for your daughter and that's great you love her, but you also need to kind of fill up your own cup as well."
15572.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I didn't think about it, like."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it can be hard to there's like a quote it's hard to pour from an empty cup right in order to pour and give all this stuff to others, you have to fill up for yourself to."
15572.0,Patient,that's true.
462.0,Provider,"So. Usually, when we start working with people we create kind of a treatment plan and some goals So what do you think would be some of your initial goals or initial thoughts that you'd like to kind of work on."
15572.0,Patient,"Every. Day. bye. say that again sorry, you were frozen like a couple of times I I well one time I didn't show up one time I didn't show up for work, because I could have sworn my schedule said, one thing and it didn't kind of against me. Just things like that, like setting a schedule and writing things down and. that's my biggest thing right now I guess."
462.0,Provider,"Okay pressure yeah that's a good start so trying to set a schedule trying to write things down. Sometimes, it can be helpful to have a time in a day each week where you know that that's like your scheduling and organization time. Can you think of a day, where you have like maybe 15 minutes to sit down and sometimes like a Sunday could be a good going into the week or a Friday, ending the week getting ready for the next week that you think you could sit down and start to do that."
15572.0,Patient,Probably Fridays because they want to give me Fridays and Saturdays off like.
462.0,Provider,it's okay it's.
15572.0,Patient,Every week that's another thing my work schedules been all over the place they're just now setting a permanent one so.
462.0,Provider,"yeah, and that makes it hard really hard to keep track of."
15572.0,Patient,Dallas yeah.
462.0,Provider,"So all right, you can establish that as your first goal for the treatment plan of just trying to. establish a schedule write things down and. Trying to accomplish that by setting aside time on Friday every week to. Sit down and do that do you, you said you have a calendar so, is it just a matter of actually writing in it and. Yes, checking it."
15572.0,Patient,Not procrastinating writing in it.
462.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah okay yeah so trying to write in it as soon as you know, basically. Right okay. All right, um so that's one goal how about a second what would you say would be just a secondary goal."
15572.0,Patient,"Finding somebody to talk to when I get like that in the morning it's early in the morning, but I know people that would would answer the phone whatever."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's a really great idea. So reaching out to your support. When you feel like you need help, turning things around a bit right so like you said you wake up and it's just really immediately bad for you. Right, how can you turn that around well other people can be helpful yeah."
15572.0,Patient,"I don't I don't like how I get in the morning, I guess, after i'd been that way I just I kind of don't like myself per minute."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah well like I said it's. it's hard that's a really early start time and so maybe that that's a great secondary goal to try to call on someone else or support. Like I said it can be helpful to have your own affirmation something like I don't know just even like I accept things are as they, as they are right now, or you know I. acknowledge where i'm at but i'm choosing to turn things around right now, do you have any little phrases that inspire you that you think you could try to repeat to yourself, if no one's available."
15572.0,Patient,I know I have a chip on that I like give any rain. Okay. Progress not perfection.
462.0,Provider,"that's a really good one. yeah so maybe next time you wake up feeling that way you try to call someone for social support if someone's not available, and maybe you just start saying itself progress not perfection progress not perfection and just kind of keep saying it until you notice a little bit of a shift."
15572.0,Patient,yeah that is depression.
462.0,Provider,"yeah it can be. really hard, but it is possible to kind of slowly start changing your thoughts. Slowly start creating new mental habits right."
15572.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're thinking about getting that time to write down your schedule each week. As well as. Trying to just add to your calendar, as things come up you're thinking about trying to reframe your mornings, by calling on other people are going to your progress not perfection affirmation. How about other things that have been going on with you, what would you. say is your biggest stressors right now."
15572.0,Patient,"The being on to work on time thing has been because I got called into the office, the other day, and they went over how many times i've been late or days i've missed and they that I think you get five points and then you're fired and i'm at three and a half right now. And I can that really stresses me out because I can't afford to lose my job and. I please."
462.0,Provider,"Okay. that's so. Huge yeah that's really stressful to be at that three and a half point mark and just be really concerned, so what would you say is your biggest barrier to getting to work on time."
15572.0,Patient,"Getting up when the alarm goes off probably or getting trying to get a little bit more sleep than I do. I mean, I feel fine after I leave and I get there i'm not wrong here and I just think I could be maybe an hour or two more sleep."
462.0,Provider,"Sure it's that. Initial wake up where it's just you're not quite ready so maybe you try to just work your bedtime up a half an hour just starting with a half an hour right two hours might be too extreme so maybe you try to work it up a half an hour and see how that makes you feel. Also, do you use your phone as an alarm."
15572.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
462.0,Provider,Some people find it helpful to either set the alarm on their phone and Hello.
15572.0,Patient,Sorry.
462.0,Provider,"that's okay yeah some people find it helpful to set the alarm on their phone and maybe put their phone, on the other side of the room really loud, so you have to get up to turn it off or use a traditional alarm clock and put that on the other. side of the room for really loud."
15572.0,Patient,I thought about getting this alarm clock I saw online like a ball or something twice on the alarm and you have to get up and change.
462.0,Provider,"That might be, you know something to consider just. Going in you have you have to stand up right. To do it, and then you're up. So that can be something to look into even if you dont I i've heard of those those kind of fancy ones that you described, but even just a. old school alarm clock that's really loud and it's, on the other end of the room will make you certainly want to get up and turn it off and then you're up."
15572.0,Patient,Right that's true.
462.0,Provider,"yeah. So. A couple things to think about there, how do you feel about that as a starting point for your goals and treatment plan."
15572.0,Patient,I feel good about that. I hope it helps because I can't really I can't afford to keep being late. and
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that could be. Maybe you move that to the top of the list, trying to move your bedtime up a half an hour and trying to get something. Across the room that's going to wake you up and get you up that's loud. And then go for the organization and the trying to generally reframe your mindset in the morning."
15572.0,Patient,yeah the organization on my part is a big challenge. For everything really. I always say i'm a mess. And I mean it.
462.0,Provider,"yeah well, maybe you start to just tell yourself i'm not a mess anymore. i'm organized. As even before you are right, it can start with a thought, and then the actions comes to maybe start to focus on nope i'm not a mess anymore, I have my calendar and i'm going to do that now just trying to really start. Changing changing those thoughts, because it usually goes kind of thought feeling action. So actions start with those thoughts."
15572.0,Patient,that's right.
462.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, so with those things in mind how about we schedule you then for next time we can go towards the end of the month."
15572.0,Patient,"All right. i'm gonna write it down on available or when you tell me, I was just gonna say that this is a good start so there's no procrastination straight to the calendar. Ray."
462.0,Provider,"So. Are you available on Wednesday, the. 29th December."

With them next time, but you can start you know, trying to take care of yourself a little bit too and just affirm yourself that you're not a mess you don't have to be you know you can make small changes to get there."
