Just so like me, she asked me why I said it's just I don't like the way I feel in this space, right now, so like before I would I realized that always force myself to do things or talk about things that made me very uncomfortable. And now it's just like if I don't want to talk about it i'm not going to talk about it and i'm not taking any like believe for for not wanting to talk about how I feel in that yeah. cuz like you know, sometimes like especially mothers they're like I want you to tell me now like what is bothering you can think. They don't really understand like boundaries, but then I don't like I have spoken to mom i'm 25 years old."

759.0,Provider,"You know I don't know if you want to talk about that more in terms of how you feel about your marriage now, or we can table it for another discussion."
16325.0,Patient,"um no, I think. I have accepted that the marriage is not going to go any further, I think that is just my husband and my mom are having a hard time. I mean it's fine. You guys can process it's not like i'm like if there's a one big file for divorce and like they get really shocked about it. And you know. i've spoken to you about you know where i'm saying it's not going to come as like this, like a sudden thing. So that's it. But my husband I think we're fine we actually like we kind of live everyone has their own room maybe you feel say I like a roommate situation like we all just missing the same House we get along they kind of. Watch movies together again so it's more like a bad. Situation yeah yeah it'd be very awkward if I had to like sleep next to you. But I don't have to do that."
759.0,Provider,So it's kind of like fun roommate situation. yeah yeah.
16325.0,Patient,"Because like i'm the reason the marriage started like feeling in the first place was because we stopped having sex, I think, in April last year. yeah so, then I was I kept trying to get him to like initiate and more. You know, like do stuff. And it just didn't work at all and. If it did, it was just so bad that. Like you know, like. Over time, the chemistry like fizzled when it when the sex. So I think once that happened I stopped seeing him is like a lover just more like a friend."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
16325.0,Patient,"So we just like we would hang out, you know will cook meals together, but we stopped like kissing and stuff like that just close it was just like for me on my end the camera she was gone."
759.0,Provider,You can rescue sky. yeah kind of hard to probably make that decision.
16325.0,Patient,"You know, Israel long time I. took the whole plans here."
759.0,Provider,"decide yeah. yeah The reality is, is that you don't have the same feelings that you used to have for. him for friend now."
16325.0,Patient,Okay here here.
759.0,Provider,"yeah, what do you guys didn't do was you know feels natural you know, to have the chemistry has gone away the chemistry has gone away. yeah like in. So."
16325.0,Patient,You can force it.
759.0,Provider,yeah you can't force it. yeah you did your best to kind of rekindle.
16325.0,Patient,"You know, oh my God so. yeah so that's I told her i'm just tired now like that's why I don't want to do anything because I did so much for so long, and then, when I handed you the ball you didn't even know what to do with it. Just like obviously like. Nothing I did already work, so why would I want to put more effort into the yeah so the he says, like okay. he's a very like i'm very i'm the like crazy vibrations partner. For more like column. saw food yeah so it's like not my to be rich and he was just like okay. yeah because, like I said, like let's not make it an ugly separation, if we do. You know, because we would be great friends."
759.0,Provider,You know yeah yeah. Good good friends so some ugly separation. yeah okay so that's where you out with him.
16325.0,Patient,that's where I met we don't know where everyone.
759.0,Provider,"Telephone yeah me your mother yeah. yeah well i'm glad that you got your mom support. You know, like she came out she visited you and that you guys got to go to New York. You got there on doing different things you know so that would be seeing you I think just having her support, even though she can be you know she she tried to be your DEMO purpose, which is i'm sure a little annoying. boy."
16325.0,Patient,"you're like. Looking at like. you're you're a nurse, and especially your speciality is gerontology. Young. is different so yeah she's so funny little so when she tries. That she's so nice and so blind she's only 51."
759.0,Provider,Oh she's only 50.
16325.0,Patient,"But then i'd be like mom your thoughts are in the drawer then she just looked at me why and i'm thinking. i'm only to see. Why can you hear me. So say something like three or four times, where it's just those looking for when I get louder and louder and i'm no one hits. so good. yeah okay good. fumble she's funny."
759.0,Provider,"that's good that's good okay alright, so we got a little bit of plans for you, you know with the dancing what's your long term goal you think for Derek therapy is to become more stable or. A wellness plan or just being stable."
16325.0,Patient,"I think, just to maintain stability. Okay, you know because I know that I will never 100% be 100% stable. Member but, at least if we can get to like 80% and then the 20% become manageable. Okay yeah."
