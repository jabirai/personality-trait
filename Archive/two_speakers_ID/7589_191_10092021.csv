7589.0,Patient,"I put a hold on i'm doing anything at the pain clinic because I was getting the neurologist. And he basically told me, you know, obviously i'm too big right now for surgery come back Barry October surgery and he'll he'll get mine scheduled so. pretty much as soon as I get my BMI BMI down to 40. I can, I can go get my back surgery. The bariatric surgery."

7589.0,Patient,"Oh God it's like 70 something I think. it's. Just gonna be hard because i'm so damn sure i'm only five one. Right, so I mean. A real big issue you know because they obviously treat me like i'm way bigger than what I actually am because i'm not so sure."
191.0,Provider,"I see cuz I know the BMI looks at the height to weight ratio. So, if he goes to do the surgery. That ratio and how much. yeah that can really interfere with the procedure, so you need to be less than a 40 for the surgery. you're currently at least the 70 your BMI."
7589.0,Patient,"yeah I think I would have wound to I can't remember the exact number, it was like 200 like well down to 200 and i'm a I lost like 15 pounds total i'm only like 370 ish."

He has. incision because i'm so. So i'm hoping, I can lose a little bit more away so you know, because the surgery is not told February ELISE."
191.0,Provider,"Okay alright, so now, have you noticed the difference with the 15 pounds, because when you pick up 15 pound weights, you can feel the power, sometimes you have to pick up a 15 pound weights to really appreciate what you've lost on your body, have you can you tell the difference."

And you know what I mean down like two flights of stairs and you know, I was able to walk all the way from the stadium i'll almost back to the color and back up in the 15 minute interval and I was like belt to keel over."
191.0,Provider,"Okay breathing better with the weight loss, would you say you do have you increase is it easier for you to move around, is that what you saying breathing better easier to move around, or just less taxing."
7589.0,Patient,"Like pain was because I still hurt I mean oh my God, I can barely move right now, from sitting in those seats so long, but. Just the just not having to like sit down and catch my breath. You know, like I did. Last month, or you know the month before."

7589.0,Patient,"Actually yeah gap. With with people. You know I mean, I know that we couldn't for a minute, but i'm saying like i'm actually. that's a big step for me is to to get back in and to group gatherings, and I mean, last night I was around 500 people."
191.0,Provider,"Okay. Together, is what people. Taking the actions are you taking precautions."
7589.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah absolutely we were we were social this thing is sending everything we weren't allowed to like sit on top of each other, we had to like skip a row, when it came to. The seats and everything, so we were well away from from people but i'm just saying in general, like if if that would have been me last year I wouldn't went I would have just told her no I don't want. You know what I made up some nice I have something to do or. I haven't really been making excuses for going anyplace I actually went to this with my and. A few days ago."
191.0,Provider,"wow yeah i'm kind of here you more. sociable yeah well congratulations, let me look at the last year and drug screen for you was 929 and that was policy for buprenorphine and marijuana you know the marijuana just still want to encourage cessation of marijuana one that may help with the appetite to in a weight loss okay."
7589.0,Patient,"it's gotta happen, I guess anyway i'm not saying that i'm not probably going to start it back up because I probably will it does help with my pain, but according to the nutritionists um it can't be in my system for the surgery."
191.0,Provider,yeah a lot of places don't want the nicotine or the marijuana. yeah this will help.
7589.0,Patient,You have to quit smoking and I think a little bit of it is kind of like the religious side of that doctor's office. Okay she's turning told me that I can't do CBD either.
191.0,Provider,"And and The thing is, with a lot of the CBD it'll come up positive for marijuana so they don't know if you're really hitting the marijuana or not, so I think, to the purists point of views, you can see what i'm saying."
7589.0,Patient,"I mean I I do, but it was just kind of the way that she. Was responded about it, where I was kind of like."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, like maybe they a little. Okay, a little far reaching there in terms of expectations."
