8241.0,Patient,hey.
416.0,Provider,i'm just sitting here talking to you not realizing i'm muted. yeah just like with anyway how's it going. What do you do it kyle blah blah blah and i'm like wait what.
8241.0,Patient,"might be responding. I know I saw was muted, I was like I wonder which does gonna come. yeah."
416.0,Provider,That was that was a rookie move my rookie move for the day.
8241.0,Patient,So what do you say or did you ask.
416.0,Provider,Jeff how you doing.
8241.0,Patient,Good good.
416.0,Provider,Good.
8241.0,Patient,yeah i'm able to play guitar now I don't know if I told you that.
416.0,Provider,"yeah last time I talked to you, you."
8241.0,Patient,"know I told you that in a little bit yeah you would play a little bit, but it was really rough. yeah this is improving."
416.0,Provider,Every day.
8241.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah it's improving and i'll probably be better at once, I get full function. Just because i'm like. Because like. I really need to get my function backs on practicing like a lot more than I would normally so I probably going to be better than I was because i'm practicing so much just to get my normal function back. That it will cross over."
416.0,Provider,doing your own version of rehab huh.
8241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,You got. therapy going on.
8241.0,Patient,"Not that it's the best idea but i've always done that done my own rehab. With the methods with the with. Whatever else I guess. Like I always tell people like I don't endorse like doing it by yourself, but. I tried to go to rehab a couple times actually I mean I went to rehab five times and I stayed clean the whole time but it never it never stayed with me. And then I had to just wait until I hit the bottom it didn't matter if I went to rehab I just had to wait till the bottom and that I did, and then it was not hard to do it on my own anymore."
416.0,Provider,you're one of those those people my nephew always talks about this you're an experiential learner. Sometimes you just gotta. Sometimes you just gotta walk through some people just have to sort of walk through it themselves to learn it.
8241.0,Patient,"yeah because it's like it is when your rehab all these people are telling you different reasons why you shouldn't do it and. I don't know it's just like you need your own engine, you need your own. motivation use your own reason it's not enough to hear other people's bad stories, because you still don't have your own, and I mean unless you have your own other people's bad stories aren't going to prevent you or really do much."
416.0,Provider,"yeah what makes people follow through on actions and decisions is because it's been people do it when their. Their life depends on it, or when it aligns with their values something they feel like they need to function right. So if that's what we mean by hitting rock bottom right rock bottom means that you've lost everything of importance to you or wherever your rock bottom is you've lost the things that are most important to you, and you have a strong drive to get them back."
8241.0,Patient,"yeah and another big part is to is like. I wasn't getting anything out of it like I do tell people like. I don't know I wasn't fighting an urge because the drugs, I was getting like I wasn't feeling anymore like there was no there was no hi there is no. It was like I was just throwing money in the toilet flushing it down it's like it's like."
416.0,Provider,anymore at all.
8241.0,Patient,"yeah it is wait they do i'm doing all this work to get this money and then spending it on the stuff that's not even doing anything. At all like, not even helping me sleep so it's This is like I had to do that for like six months until I realized whoa. What the hell is the point of this and I realized that i'm addicted to not the drug but i'm addicted to the lifestyle, the driving to go score it the the waiting outside someone's house the. Calling you talking about estimation yeah yeah. So it's more has to do with the scoring and and. Getting it, but I always done it that part is the worst part, but when I look back that was probably the part that gave you the most stimulation was getting it, even though at the time. I was bitching about how much you know it sucks to you know, like have to get it like I, like you know, whatever but. I think that's what it is yeah. yeah the drugs that no effects anymore, for a long time actually I remember doing it for a while, after. And no effect and so."
416.0,Provider,um. I was going to ask you about your taper on methadone.
8241.0,Patient,"yeah What about it, what."
416.0,Provider,Where are you on that.
8241.0,Patient,i'm 30 I feel like it's a little I don't know i'm having trouble with it. I mean i'm not having.
416.0,Provider,slow down a little bit from the. I mean there's no need to rush right but. not slow down on the taper a little bit.
8241.0,Patient,"i'd like to get off yeah I did so down on it, because I don't know I don't know i'm having stomach problems sleeping well. yeah I don't want to make it make those things worse so. yeah so yeah. I worked for from like 18 to 35 so."
416.0,Provider,that's pretty impressive.
8241.0,Patient,"Well, it is, but it's probably too fast, but at the same time. I probably should have went from 8245 or something like that."
416.0,Provider,So now you're just kind of waiting to level off from where you are.
8241.0,Patient,"yeah. I think, but i'm not having cravings or anything yeah."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So I have another patient who recently got completely off of methadone and it took him. I want to say, like two years it took him a while, and he was really methodical about. You know how much he would go down, each time and then. How much time he would spend at each level to. You know, to kind of stabilize at each level before going down again and if he felt yucky he would you know stay there for a while, as long as it took to to. kind of stabilize and feel really confident before going down again, but he he was able to doing that, with that. He was able to get completely and totally off of it, and he feels great now he felt crappy after he was completely off of it for like three weeks two weeks or something like that. And it was still kind of in a system and then after that he was like it was amazing to see actually he felt a lot lot better. yeah so."
8241.0,Patient,i'm not trying to push you and.
416.0,Provider,"yeah exactly, but I think the point is exactly he took his time and was able to do it successfully because he took his time that he he also just like didn't give up, you know he didn't get discouraged along the way he wanted to plenty of times but. But he didn't he he kept it up."
8241.0,Patient,"So. I don't know I feel like a lot of it has to do with like outside forces to like if you have a job if you, you know, whatever have motivations and stuff like like if you're already depressed it's gonna be way harder to get off is what i'm trying to say. Basically, but if you know if you're feeling motivated and you're feeling like you know. i'm ready to get my life together, then it's easier, obviously."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. Yes, so him a lot of it was I think his success was around finding other ways to boost his mood. Because he has a lot of the same struggles, as you, but for him, you know he, like he does a lot of yoga he. kind of dove into going back to school like he's sort of chosen to do a bunch of different things to sort of replace those. To keep him. He works out a lot to to keep him like. To keep him steady. mm hmm. yeah."
8241.0,Patient,that's my phone is like stimulation.
416.0,Provider,yeah. I think that was definitely something that helped him well you. Have a little bit of it back now right because.
8241.0,Patient,yeah yeah I do.
416.0,Provider,So. How has your self talk been lately. Those thoughts those sabotaging thoughts.
8241.0,Patient,"It seems like when i'm trying to sleep the really, really, really, really bad. But when I get up. And like move around and stuff. it's not so bad I kinda like. See the positives but. For some reason i'm trying to sleep or late, I don't know strong asleep or waking up or laying down I don't know what the hell that's when. I feel really depressed or i'll start to think like the methadone, for example, like. Like how long is that going to take to get off like. No like really like a year I don't want to spend a year getting off that I don't even want to like I almost want to get off of it completely right now, you know I feel for the stomach issues but. I know it is, I think about methadone and then i'll think about just. Just."
416.0,Provider,starts to.
8241.0,Patient,"be like well, I want to get out of here and it's like. I want to move out, but the methadone and medication is holding me back from from doing that and and blah blah blah and. I just have friends. Or, I have a friend, or whatever and she's like getting on my ass like. You know. Get out of here get a job, whatever stuff it just makes me feel bad because it's like i'm trying my fucking hardest like I just had to end, you know and it's like. it's like people don't understand. That i'm trying."
416.0,Provider,"Is this is this friend. Somebody that you want to do is that way, why is your."
8241.0,Patient,"Recording yes know sometimes not anymore. I mean yeah, it is an x and it's been back and forth between like being a friend, but, but she doesn't want that, and i've accepted that."
416.0,Provider,This is the girl that you are with when I first met you the one who's a little bit younger than you.
8241.0,Patient,"know I wish now that one block mean doesn't talk to me. it's not that, not that I was bothering her I wasn't like. Like sending like 1000 messages she just she just blocked me probably just. I don't know I think I think. she's like really close to her family, like her mom and dad so it's like they didn't like it or something so maybe that's why I don't know that's how I accept it is. she's just. Noise sorry that's my phone. I was just scrolling through text messages, just like. it's just like i'm trying like I tell her like she must be moved to Washington, I want to move to Washington how soon is just up in the air, obviously, and i'm just like saying that yeah blah blah and she's like. I was like yeah I want to see you and she's like you may have to wait until you get to Washington someday and i'm like yeah i'm aware. And then I was like don't forget about me like joking around and she's like I will not and then whatever like two weeks later, she says How are things and I said, good I could actually. Almost play the guitar fully and then she's like nice how has been making you're moving plan, and I was like Well, first of all I need an ID and. license and all that stuff and she's like well that isn't hard you are, you are the only person stopping yourself for making your dreams come true. Have you even called the Oxford houses it's been a week, so I hope so, if you can't get to do it yourself then you're not trying and that's not that bad, but. Sometimes it'll hurt you know, like make you feel like i'm not doing anything at all."
416.0,Provider,What are the Oxford house.
8241.0,Patient,"And my parents it'll be like. her and my parents basically or well my mom her and my mom basically say the same thing to me. Except she wants me to go to Washington and my mom wants me to go to like. Monterey or something I don't know. Where my mom wants me to go, but the point is they both want me to move out and they both want me to do same kind of stuff same kind of thing, and I want to do it. But. I got in the way medication i'm. Being a depression case. I don't know all those."
416.0,Provider,guys.
8241.0,Patient,are making it really hard and or I don't even think i'm depressed I think I just haven't variety actually after after really looking at myself I don't think i'm the depression case I think i'm actually just a really anxious person I think that's what it comes down to.
416.0,Provider,yeah you definitely have disordered anxiety for sure.
8241.0,Patient,yeah but I don't think i'm depressed really I mean I don't know. The anxiety makes me like crazy it's not like I get depressed and think about killing myself it's all it'll be like i'll be so overwhelmed that i'll be like I just don't want to live it's not like a suicide thing you know what I mean it's just like a. Wanting to stop the.
416.0,Provider,madness yeah you want to get off the ride.
8241.0,Patient,"In the past, in the past, people will stake in the goal, you want to kill yourself like no, I just wanted to stop you know I mean like maybe you know put me to sleep or something just. yeah whatever. that's not."
416.0,Provider,"slowing you down a little bit kyle. Here, and no don't be sorry it's okay i'm just helping. Bring the focus back. So slowing you down a little bit it sounds like there's a lot that goes on your head, particularly around bedtime and that a lot of it is around sort of this feeling like you want to do all these things, but then you sort of get paralyzed when you think about doing them all. yeah."
8241.0,Patient,Is it to my stomach yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So there's um. I think we've talked about this before it's all about breaking things down into very small pieces and doing one thing at a time. is the only way to not get overwhelmed. So that's what I want you to come back to your brain with if you need to write it down write it down to keep a notepad next to your bed right write down those worries just get them out, and you can write like worries on one side and a to do list on the next. And the to do list, then you break it down into tiny little bits so you need an ID making a you know, maybe one thing you could do is make an appointment with the dmv. yeah right, you can do that online. So that's. sort of concrete thing that you can accomplish."
8241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"As you said, i'm saying."
8241.0,Patient,"yeah I could I could do that. And I guess, I have been doing that, but I haven't been doing it like. yeah you're right i've been doing it in a frenzy I haven't been doing it methodically like writing it down checking it off."
416.0,Provider,"But lists are great for folks with anxiety because you get it out, you get it on paper and then you can have the satisfaction checking it off right it actually psychologically is great for you, because it, you know your brain knows like i've accomplished this."
8241.0,Patient,"Actually, now that you mentioned it that's actually really good to will to journal all that and, in general, because I do like journaling and now like it right again I could write like a journal so."
416.0,Provider,Do you want to make that like kind of a goal.
8241.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah definitely."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8241.0,Patient,To to. prioritize and write it down.
416.0,Provider,Do you want to start right now and just jot a few notes down yeah what we've been talking about grabbing a journal.
8241.0,Patient,"of a lot of these I filled up like six of them. I do. A journal a lot, or at least I haven't been lately, but in the past six years i've journaled law."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8241.0,Patient,And you anyway.
416.0,Provider,"Alright, so jotted down a couple notes. She was not for."
8241.0,Patient,You was.
416.0,Provider,"love to do list i'm big fan. I do it on my iPhone now but i'm. so helpful. I would never get anything done without them. Maybe just leave that next to your bed to when you go to bed at night and just so that if a thought comes into your head about. I can't do this because I haven't done this write it down and put it on the list for something you can do tomorrow, or at least take a chunk out of or take the first step on tomorrow right."
8241.0,Patient,yeah definitely. should put those number one.
416.0,Provider,Say you're gonna you're gonna. get an appointment with the tmp. For your ID.
8241.0,Patient,Number One.
416.0,Provider,I don't know it would be an easy thing to check off. Because you can just set up an appointment online.
8241.0,Patient,yeah that's why that's why I said that exactly actually but you're.
416.0,Provider,Perfect I mean.
8241.0,Patient,Like.
416.0,Provider,I always like an easy win first right do something quick getting easy when you're about to tackle something more difficult. you'll be feeling good I feel like. i'm on a roll now right.
8241.0,Patient,yeah yeah no that's good point. Okay.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and then you mentioned something about Oxford House what is Oxford house oh that's a it's a sober living environment. Okay, and you want to give them a call."
8241.0,Patient,"um yeah yeah I have to, I want to."
416.0,Provider,To see what about what about putting that on your list.
8241.0,Patient,"Oh yeah that that's that's what I mean it's definitely. supposed to be on the list. right here, right right no action. there's just a lot of them and I don't know where to start I guess. So."
416.0,Provider,"The single I do just start with the single phone call. I mean, where else can you start."
8241.0,Patient,"yeah you're right, I guess, I meant like what area or whatever, but you're right. For me, if exactly."
416.0,Provider,yeah exactly yeah or if it's not in the area that you want to be in or whatever.
8241.0,Patient,"yeah you know what a problem, one problem that's like I guess i'm I always bring it up, but I feel like it's something I don't really talk about much because it's like. i'm always toughing through it, but it's like I do miss using. Like I do miss having that stimulation and."
416.0,Provider,You do like.
8241.0,Patient,I know and it's like.
416.0,Provider,yeah you're not the only one who.
8241.0,Patient,"says this to me i'm not going to go back. And that's good and i'm strong enough not to go back, but I dream about it. Constantly and. I just. Know it's common."
416.0,Provider,it's common but you're experiencing is normal i've had i've had probably three different patients say that to me this week.
8241.0,Patient,"Better clean, though."
416.0,Provider,Better totally clean in recovery solid in their recovery been in recovery for a while.
8241.0,Patient,"See, so I know cuz i'm two years and it's like I thought I wouldn't even be thinking about it, by now, I mean that might have to do with because i'm still stuck in kind of a weird place, but I still feel like. What you know I might get everything together, and then I still might I don't know it's like someone then have to stop eating chocolate and then, like all these things about chocolate isn't."
416.0,Provider,"Well it's thinking, I think the important thing is to think about so it isn't like you're physically craving them. it's like you're it's like you're. you're missing aspects of the LIFE you had when you were using."
8241.0,Patient,I missed the ritual and it's bothering me I don't know until you. I don't know how to substitute for it.
416.0,Provider,"So that's important right is the the the the ritual around it. And so, but we're gonna have to figure out, I mean this is the recovery work right, how do we find a healthy version of that ritual it's not going to be exactly the same um."
8241.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,it's important to you then we'll need to find some other aspects of it.
8241.0,Patient,"Well, I mean it's kind of funny because I have been trying like lightweight. rituals like like Okay, so I used to do like i'm not gonna be along, but I used to like do drugs and like get my music on. And then, like get my space all figured out whatever OK OK, I replaced that with instead of you know, doing hardcore drugs and instead I smoke marijuana and listen to music but it's just not the same it just doesn't. it's just it's boring. I just I mean not listening to music but trying to reach that same stimulation or trying to reach that same ritual by using marijuana just doesn't work and i've tried it."
416.0,Provider,And it's not.
8241.0,Patient,"That might not be a healthy way, I know that but it's just like i've tried substitutes and it's just like I don't know how to reach that level of."
416.0,Provider,"So it isn't necessarily about a substitute right because a substitute probably the only way to get a substitute would be to have the. exact same you know you'd be substituting one like negative addictive behavior for another, so we aren't necessarily looking for the substitute, but we are looking for healthy alternatives."
8241.0,Patient,"Well that's how bad it is i'm almost looking to looking at the lesser evils, you know what I mean like shit well that's not as bad so maybe I should do it like I don't know like I mean even social media like i'll do like that will be like. You know kind of a thing is stimulating or whatever, or like. Just that kind of thing."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, but we want to be careful with that right so."
8241.0,Patient,you're looking at.
416.0,Provider,Something that you feel kind of passionate about and I think that's great I want. You to feel that you're passionate.
8241.0,Patient,That I can play again.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And I think you know you already do have something that kind of works. It just isn't fully floating your boat. Because it. You know you're not able to play live right now, you know you've had some setbacks with your hand it cove it has been a massive setback for you, with regard to this so. But there's there's room to grow in this right, so this is a passion of yours, there will be opportunities, hopefully soon for you to play live again for you to reconnect with other musicians all of that so."
8241.0,Patient,"Yes, that is, that out. yeah and that that actually is a higher high than drugs playing live."
416.0,Provider,yeah there you go.
8241.0,Patient,it's just hard to get but but yeah you're right that's true.
416.0,Provider,"So I mean, I think, then we can refocus on that it isn't the drugs that you're missing it's it's the. feeling of euphoria that dope I mean that just that feeling of wonderfulness that comes with doing something that you're passionate about and really enjoy and you got it from drugs for a while until battle. When, in a bad direction."
8241.0,Patient,"I think, is just a long time, yes, like seven years I think that's what it is. But I feel like I had to do it for seven years for. Like if I would have done it for two years, I don't think I would have been able to quit like I don't know I think I would have went back to it because I wouldn't have been fully done with it like I don't know."
416.0,Provider,there's a whole thing of like getting it out of your system.
8241.0,Patient,"And that's a controversial idea because, can you ever get it out of your system, I don't know I feel like I did but that's that's really depends on the person."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I think we go through phases in our lives that are really natural and you know it worked for you, for a while and I mean maybe it never worked completely, but it it gave you something that was important to you for."
8241.0,Patient,"Like I was getting back what I was missing like. In my in the late because my my late teens were really terrible so I felt like okay good i'm finally getting what I deserved i'm getting it. You know i'm happy, you know."
416.0,Provider,"So it served a purpose until it didn't and it takes that takes, you know that sort of. cycle takes a little bit longer for different people depending on who you are and why you're doing it, and all that, but you hit you hit the end it was the end of a phase. It was the end of a part of your life, and I think we have a very natural yeah we have natural parts of our lives, and you know what is it the the Bob dylan right for there's there's a season, but isn't it, but it says thing for every."
8241.0,Patient,would show.
416.0,Provider,The Bob dylan it's a song. The song the lyrics.
8241.0,Patient,i'm.
416.0,Provider,"Every time I think of this it's a different song keeps coming to my head, so I don't know. it's just that there's a season for everything right in our lives. yeah I believe i'm not thinking everything."
8241.0,Patient,is okay that makes sense. that's a good one.
416.0,Provider,"And this isn't this isn't your season for heroin anymore. No that's using this as past, this is going to be your season for something different. yeah heroin season."
8241.0,Patient,Not that it's not that it matters but um they don't even have heroin it's all fentanyl it's all.
416.0,Provider,way worse.
8241.0,Patient,August yeah so I mean like it's that that helps actually that makes me not want to even think about. scary because it's all fat knowing it's all bros and.
416.0,Provider,that's scary.
8241.0,Patient,It makes me want to throw it because I know the taste of it and it's just.
416.0,Provider,That that it's tough it's dangerous so dangerous yeah I worry about anybody who's shooting heroin or just using using heroin in any way. Better right now.
8241.0,Patient,"I thought I was better before, because I was smoking it but it's like either you're going to lose your veins or your teeth and I ended up losing my teeth, but I got it fixed, but I did lose some teeth, so I learned my lesson."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah. there's an old song. By by the I don't know if you know to pop music at all like old.
8241.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,Do you know the band seven seconds.

8241.0,Patient,"No, I don't know the song, though."
416.0,Provider,"You got to look at at at some point, like a punk rock to you. And so what you were just saying reminded me of that it's like hard living punk rock."
8241.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah. I know right.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm and Kevin has punk rock D yeah.
8241.0,Patient,yeah but I don't want punk rock.

8241.0,Patient,"You want the punk without the teeth yeah Oh, maybe I did hear that song. I don't know that's a good thing it's something else but either way."

416.0,Provider,hey thanks yeah. seven seconds that's my generation was a long time ago.
8241.0,Patient,"I missed the 80s right it's not that long ago I don't think it is that long ago, but I mean a little younger."
416.0,Provider,that's pretty good music yeah I grew up in the 80s and 90s.
8241.0,Patient,"that's my favorite Decade for music. 1980s and 90s, I guess. I like the 80s actually a lot more than you would think."
