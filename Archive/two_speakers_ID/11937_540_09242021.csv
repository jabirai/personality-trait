540.0,Provider,Okay Saturday. Okay yeah yeah it makes more sense okay so yeah yeah.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm excited about that I went yesterday to go practice on more because it was like a studio where you my friend, how it's like credits, and so we went there for two hours, the person who got me the show and we worked on. me getting used to like the equipment like that's going to be at the club more than just like the ones that I have at home they've been using so she said, I was doing well, so she says i'll be fine, so the more prepared than her so. But."
540.0,Provider,"Also that's good one, so the setup is a little bit more intense right then even the studio or."
11937.0,Patient,"Was I know it's. it's more like more like the studio because I just have a thing that's like a solid like board. And there's like two things that have it's like detachable so it's like. Set with more equipment and so more options like cheese microphones and other stuff too, so it was a little intimidating, but I did it for like an hour and 20 minutes and went well so. But yeah."
540.0,Provider,So how are you feeling about that do you have everything squared away all your songs and everything.
11937.0,Patient,"um I have the songs i'm going to use, but I need to narrow it down and have like a set order how i'm going to play them, so I have like. 25 so far that I have an Nea about like 60 so it's not too bad just more like a selection from your shoes on and see like for the vibe of the place is just kind of like going off of that too yeah, and so it should be fun though i'm excited and all nervous. I told her like Okay, if I have like one drink beforehand, just like to help with the nerves a little bit. To open me up like so I can dance to not be like steph and like look awkward on stage in front of all which people the venue I Scott moved to a place with that's for bigger capacity so it's going to be bigger than that how we thought it would be so wow. Okay yeah so i'm a little nervous but it's Okay, and no but today was a little hard I woke up just kind of sad I just same stuff of Dalton just gonna hit me and i've been still feeling like homesick and. I just the anxiety, with everything and just I don't know just been kind of hard still it still comes up every so often and so today was I just woke up kind of felt bad, but natural medicine, I felt a little better, but. Still, like it's still hurts."
540.0,Provider,I mean it's going to take time so it's going to be those waves where you're gonna feel them come and go.
11937.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,Have you talked to a doll in and since we last spoke.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah I told him that the when I went yesterday with a girl's name is katie who, out of the gate she was like. She actually said that they're having another show that if I would like to do it, too, since she said that saw that I did. pretty well just the practicing so I was like yeah i'd be down, and so it would be October 31 and so that's an adult and about it, and he said to. The guy that's really cool and he's not much of a texture so it's kind of like hard, I tried calling him, but he was still at work, because it randomly at work so but. yeah We talked every so often nothing too much, though, and I still like want to mail him something so really just the physical and you said before so but I need to figure out what what it is it's just a postcard or something and so."
540.0,Provider,So when when Dalton did you invite him to this show.
11937.0,Patient,You wouldn't have been able to it's too far for him okay okay yeah so 14 hour drive here so so.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so it'd be a pretty significant. yeah. Good stretch yeah I."
11937.0,Patient,"kind of figured I know I told him I hope if I ever do a show in portland that him and MAC can go and then that'd be really cool if somebody. He said something along the lines yeah that that would be fun so yeah. But the big thing that I think happened last week was a me and my mom pretty big argument, where she wasn't talking to me for a couple days, I guess, and so it was kind of like that was kind of really hard actually to. ended up staying over at my friend's house one night, which was fine and then said stay another. And she's just kind of stressed out with me because, like she's like I can't sleep at night and you're usually works out with the dogs down. And I even tried to compromise and tell her like hey like and i'll be back at times you need to take them down, but still just want to be here, and she just said it wasn't how she wanted it to be she got mad at me and. she's like I pay for everything for you i'm always supporting you and you can't be here to help me how. So, but we talked it over and it's fine now, but it was it was hard she wasn't talking for like three days really just minimal and it kind of felt very uncomfortable and. She her reasoning was because, like it is because I guess I heard that I wasn't here, but I mean, and then I was like whoa like I could like drive back, which is like. An seven eight minute drive away 12 minute drive and she was like don't waste, the gas don't I feel like I guess you put money in my car for for gas and. She I guess she didn't even really have much money into but she still did that, and I was like well like I. know she tries she overextend yourself to me when I don't even realize things and then she gets mad when like I can't do something for her. And she's like I do all this and, like you, can't even be here like she has lupus she's like I feel like i'm having a flare up and. Like you weren't here, take the dogs down and I need sleep and like I need help and like as you're getting paid from the state to be here and help me. And I don't ask for much me and I was like yeah but like it's just it's just because it's like a week before my show i've been like wanting to be around people like who are of the demographic, but the show which was my friend."
540.0,Provider,And kind of give you not kind of like the vibes before the show but guy into that headspace.
11937.0,Patient,"Calm yeah yeah and so. It it works it works itself out she ended up talking to me and she's like I just want you to like. Get be more responsible with the things I need sneak from you, and she was like I want you to like try to get a job after this is over, so the good thing is over and. At least like if you're doing something even if it's not like a lot like just you I want it's like. So basically i'm probably going to try to see if I could like uber eats grub hub and see if I can make some extra money with that and but I mean I already get paid from the state to help her and I. sent her some money already to like help out and but I know she's listening to my phone bill and so she's wondering, to take that over and so i'll have my my car payment terms and the phone bill so it's just I know I guess just emotions been highly here because. My uncle's also going through like a huge divorce thing and so she's trying to help him out with that and so that's why I don't have a room, because my grandparents are here because there's two families and their house. So, and they have like full family of little kids, and so my grandmother was staying with us in a two bedroom with me my grandpa my grandma and my mom so."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so the House is kind of packed right now."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah it's been for a while, since I moved here, this has been but it's still kind of like."
540.0,Provider,Oh no there's probably I mean there's more emotion now right since the divorce or How long have they been there or is that that's recent right.
11937.0,Patient,My grandma's my grandparents been here. Since the. yep but the divorce is recent where my mom's trying to help them out and help support me my grandma and grandpa and like still being there for her brother so she just spread thin right now too so.
540.0,Provider,"i'm the stress summer how have you have you guys ever sat down to really like see like expectations of like what she needs what you need and what you guys expected like with you, moving back."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah I realized, we had this conversation like not long ago or my sister even involved, it was like a big state and. Once like. kissing yeah OK cool and so she was like I thought you said you were going to be down here to help me with that and I was like. I guess what after being here, I just realized I didn't even have the capacity to be there for someone really either, and so we kind of talked about that too and she's she's understanding she knows i'm going through a lot, too, but it's just. She has ADHD too, so it can sometimes be explosive but both of us."
540.0,Provider,"And I mean when emotions are high so say she's dealing with the lupus and then she she also has your mom she could be worried about you, in general, so you being home, it may be like her sense of comfort knowing how you are. So it could be also that she may not be talking about as your mom because, obviously, as, apparently they're going to be worried."
11937.0,Patient,"But they're not going to want to stay right yeah yeah so especially this time I think it was lack of communication and it felt like she gets hurt she said she shuts down because just don't want to fight which does not like talk when she's emotional. And so it's more like. Yes, just chose to like ignore me because she was hurt and I was trying to like call her and she was done picking up my phone holes and I was just like looks like talk this through i'm trying to like come to. my mind, I saw as a compromise me driving across town even that little bit twice, it was 10am 2am that I had to be here to take the dogs down, and so, which I stay up late anyway, so it works out fine. And so. her head she's like you're spending money you don't have to go back and forth like it, she she like she's like oh. No worries."
540.0,Provider,Okay hold on I think I hear you again.
11937.0,Patient,You can hear me.
540.0,Provider,"Yes, okay. So you said. So it was something into am and you stay up so it's pretty."
11937.0,Patient,"works out, yes, I take the dogs down at 10pm and 2am. As well as you said, like track that should take out the trash and other times during the day, depending but, like the set time she knew, just like 10 and 2am so she can sleep the night. Because whenever dogs is kind of dying, but it, and so the medicine she's on helps make some have to pee a lot. And then, when he has to pee it makes them cough because it was so hard and large, so it pushes up on those trachea so it kind of makes him feel like he's like having to coffin like kind of joking. So we have to take him down to go to the bathroom a lot, so if he doesn't isn't uncomfortable so."
540.0,Provider,How old is your dog.
11937.0,Patient,Oh he's like 12 1213 something like that.
540.0,Provider,That when you're in childhood dogs.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah maybe maybe Maybe it was 2011 maybe he's 10 vs 10 but yeah it was my childhood dog Okay, we have three dogs so."
540.0,Provider,You have three dogs.
11937.0,Patient,"Yet, to have them from the same letter and then one of them's a different freedom from the smaller like a toy Chihuahua mix with the. tropics with toy poodles like that."
540.0,Provider,"And the ones that you have that, on the same letter is that the older dogs or. yeah okay all right how's the other like the brother sister dog."
11937.0,Patient,"The brother is he's. he's just old it's just progressive with age, so too bad he has it right so whenever he's like walking upstairs he's always slow, but sometimes I can't take him up like pick you up, especially when it's like tired and I woke them up to go to the bathroom and so i'm like okay."
540.0,Provider,Like okay.
11937.0,Patient,"So, but no, it was just. I think in my head I just saw it as like the reactions that was that I got towards my me, I felt wasn't matching what was actually a situation, but through her emotions I guess it was valid, but like I just felt like it wasn't a valid reaction in general to me and so. And apart what."
540.0,Provider,Did you guys talk about that.
11937.0,Patient,"No, we talked about it, she like she perfectly like I hadn't even made it worse, I had my grandma come in and like cuz she lives with us, and I was talking to my grandma for advice from it and. My mom was like, why are you gonna like my almost kind of upset with that and my grandmother was like saying well let's just like. Have a sit down and talk about now and she's like I don't want to like not right now, like, I told you i'll talk to you and i'm ready and new respect my space and she can like snapped up my grandma my grandma was just like was like done and she just went to her room and so. yeah because a lot of that nature but."
540.0,Provider,When was that night.
11937.0,Patient,"This was so I think this happens Sunday night and maybe. Monday Monday or Saturday, no Monday or Sunday is when that happened."
540.0,Provider,Okay.
11937.0,Patient,"Alright, so that was last week."
540.0,Provider,"yeah and when did you guys some what resolve it like how many days, because."
11937.0,Patient,"So i'd say probably until. Wednesday yeah so I know with my anxiety I just didn't feel good and like I don't like someone not talking to me at all yeah and so. It just it feels uncomfortable and it's like It made me feel like you're just like walking on eggshells, even though she just literally just wasn't talking to me and so. That was kind of hard and. How did you."
540.0,Provider,How did you cope those days that she wasn't talking to you.
11937.0,Patient,"On. Those days just continuing on the work that had to do and I just cannot continue I didn't really do much anything else. that's actually I was stressed out, so I have a I guess that's the way I cope to, and I was like I because I wasn't being for a second, and then I was just like i'm stressed and i'm crying. So it sounds nice somewhat, and so, but. No, it was just hard and I feel like. she's here she says like i'm always like never there for her and it always she's always on the backburner when she like ben's backwards from me and so it's just kind of like. hard to like. Try to live my life and not making you an upset you know. And so."
540.0,Provider,"I mean and that's the hard thing so like you said, where you moved back in order to kind of take care of yourself and basically like repair yourself and be able to build who you are so it's hard to do that and then also take care of things sometimes."
11937.0,Patient,Because the focus.
540.0,Provider,"The focus of you coming back it was really for you to focus on yourself, so I can see where you may have that struggle of trying to find yourself enjoying life and reconnecting with things that maybe weren't connecting with or finding new things like this, DJ so. yeah there's there's also that aspect that's there too."
11937.0,Patient,"um yeah for sure it's been and then she's like she says, I get mad at her Whenever she asked me for anything and I explained to her like I don't even realize that I am having an attitude it's like. I just told her like it's hard for me like switch tasks, and so I think just me having to switch tasks makes me like irritated not that she's asked me for something."
540.0,Provider,And what did she say back to that.
11937.0,Patient,"I don't remember it wasn't like anything basically she was just like i'm telling you like how I feel like. This is my house, I want you to respect like how I feel like you're suddenly she like yourself for like mental health, but like you're not worrying about like my mental health me. What i'm going through right now, and like that's why like just when she was asking for like space and so and I apologize for that and I apologize for like bringing my grandma and and so that was a. It was it was just a tough stressful week with that yeah but."
540.0,Provider,"I can imagine, and then on top of that, you also have this show coming up. yeah but it's always gonna be nerve wracking to it's your first show."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so. it's been it's been it's been a little bit stressful but. It helps hearing that my friend who DJ so that like she thinks she wouldn't even know, and I just started a month ago, so that's good that's hot."
540.0,Provider,it's an anchor great we're sharing thing.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah yeah for sure, because I have a lot of friends who are like Oh, like you, sound great like I don't even like you know but i'm like for someone who actually knows how to do it it's a different game, like their opinion versus like someone else so."
540.0,Provider,"Well, and it's got a great that she already talked to you about a show so is that, like a Halloween show."
11937.0,Patient,yeah yeah so it's the 31st Halloween show.
540.0,Provider,I mean that's exciting that she's already kind of setting them up for another one.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no I appreciate it, I was like I asked her to I was like when do you guys have like the next events, and so, and she was really nice and she she uh. I was just kind of awkward because I hadn't seen her since high school, I mean you know her in high school, so it was kind of a little awkward like senior her at first, but then it was fine so."
540.0,Provider,Did you guys like career.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. It was it was more like well because it's hard to talk and DJ at the same time. That consistently the deeper conversations, so we update each other on our lives and what we were doing and I she's apparently going to law school but taking a break from it right now how's it go that's really cool so and. yeah, and so I know it was it was nice it was really nice to reconnect and get to know her before going to the show, and then, so I there's that we stick another familiar face between like everyone else there yeah so."
540.0,Provider,"So with her, did you did you know her so she set you up for the show is that."
11937.0,Patient,"Well yeah so my friend matt ladder once you California, who said, told me about Oh, she does like DJ like maybe like usually talk to her what I was doing like making music more music production more, and so I reached out and then. He or she reached out to me, she said, since you're doing so good, with ticket sales we're going to give you, plus two I don't know what that means. i'll ask her afterwards."
540.0,Provider,"plus two is that mean, maybe like two tickets for your."
11937.0,Patient,"Oh yeah so they don't need to worry about the cover Oh, I see I get a plus I see that yeah that's cool. yeah but. 18."
540.0,Provider,Oh that's amazing Jose.
11937.0,Patient,"Some of them. I was like let's just buy like a couple. Like my grandma bought a couple extra tickets, my friend bought like three tickets and. awesome so just helped me get in through the door and like so again another gig says like because it kind of matters is that how many people, you can bring and then i'm bringing other people too, so it'll be fun and a lot of people. But i'm sad because my my best friend my other best friend their albums ago, so one of them went has a music festival they're going to, and then the other one is working until after my set so. Okay, oh yeah."
540.0,Provider,And what friends are those are those ones that you've been hanging out with their.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah my friend amanda, which is no longer yeah will not went to portland and everything and then I have different selena she actually went to portland to and so she she I met her at starbucks and then. We just like became friends and I moved to portland she moved up there, then amanda moved up there, we didn't learn together only me and amanda live together, but then they both speak for like a year since they were up there, and then I have stayed pull it. All together yeah. yeah."
540.0,Provider,"You guys all ended up back. home. Okay, are you guys okay."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah we're off basically from simi Valley. And so, but no yeah it's a. it's been Nice."
540.0,Provider,"um what happened with you and I know that you and your mom were talking about your friend, did you end up talking to your friend about her language or anything like that."
11937.0,Patient,"No yeah I was just like totally K like you're here can you just like watch your language, a little bit. And she was like yeah that's fine she was respectful about it. Okay, I was I didn't think she would not be so I mean it was fine and so. yeah that was fine and that's another thing my mom was upset about she was saying, like you, don't like you always defend your friends, but you don't like defend our household here, and this and that and. I know I think her mentality is very much like be with, why are you against me if i'm doing all this for you like, you should leave support, like me, and like oh no. it's it's we have like complicated history of just in general it's always like. Like like I love her and it's it's like. I want like I always feel like I have a wall with her maybe it's like just constant fight fighting through the past or maybe her having lupus and not feeling like. wanting to get as close because, like that hurt to in general and just everything it's just it's it's always been something that's been like. kind of took off, but not bad like we because we were really close growing up and then like I was kind of curious I kicked for a while, because my sister moved away back to California, we moved to Florida for a year, when I was eight. And so it was just kind of me and her, and I think there was like a codependency that she like had with me and so. It kind of that's why moving away helped a lot, especially will help us with like being closer, but now, then back it's kind of like. stressful and she's like no she doesn't want to try to control me or stop me from doing things but right now it's more like she needs the help and you just like be more responsible and, on top of it so."
540.0,Provider,"You. know with you guys so with a codependent do you feel like there's like a lack of like foundry, to the point of like having a certain extent of like us, helping and assisting one another or."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah I would say so um she like. She. Will in the past, like it was meaning like since I will like I would make money and then i'll give her money, but then like I felt like I never was like manage my own money. She would like have like access to see like what I spent money on through my account when I was younger and then like get mad at me for like doing anything. Like that was frivolous and she's like tries to support me as much as she can it makes her mad that I spend money or do things that she feels like like I would like to do that, but I don't because I help you and so. kind of stuff it's really weird and I knew she had a lot of mental health journey to go through for understanding herself with ADHD and such and and she has like ptsd from her childhood my grandpa was a marine kind of abusive. may find now he's very mellow and doesn't not even abusive at all, but um he she just had a hard childhood that I know like there's a lot more like trauma responses and I guess abandonment responses that comes out. And so that's why like I understood why she felt way she did because, like it's like well I listen that's how I tried to like separate myself from filling because. When she like gets matched gets really mad and then like she's fine the next day, so I figured it would be something like that, like she's just mad at me now, but like she was being like just. Oh no and then like she's upset she can like sometimes like manipulative on some level and she's like even notice it, but like like guilt trips and. Can you hear me."
540.0,Provider,yeah okay you're just you're. Just frozen.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah and so there's things like that, and I know when I came back before she got mad at me saying like. Why are you crying over here at the neighbors when you like came down here, I was with my friend matt from portland and we came down and drove down and she's like you're supposed to be here like being with your dog isn't that. and Then. Then it was like. My dog still alive, a year later, and I was like I even called her, I was like are you sure like. you're you know upset that i'm not there for you, because if you listen to what you're upset about you should be like. For like be honest like that's why you're upset not upset It makes me feel guilty my dog is dying and not being there for them, they drove all the way down here already, and so."
540.0,Provider,"More like forthcoming to like that, like the actual meaning behind what she's saying."
11937.0,Patient,yeah because sometimes they don't even think she realizes like what she's doing or like why she's doing something she's just like. An ADHD and like just goes off of how she's feeling in the moment and says something and instead of taking a step back and understanding what she is she wants and she doesn't like asking for help either. which I think is like another like trauma thing and use like asking for help and so maybe my grandma's is some way so.
540.0,Provider,"i'm sure. Her mom to asking like her child for help, but then it's also then there's the dynamic, where she expects to help too because she's taking care of the finances now so. feel like there's that weird dynamic where there's probably this pole in her where it's like okay I don't want to ask my son for help, so maybe she won't ask you until it becomes like too much and built up. Inside yeah. yeah I was like okay like I need help, instead of asking you like, little by little, what she needs."
11937.0,Patient,"No yeah for sure, I think I think you can see that and then. looks like I told something my sister. see what it was that I was like he told me therapist this. It was. And that's another thing my sister like got mad at me for like cuz she doesn't see the whole thing and I like got mad at her, and then we worked it out and she's like i'm sorry i'm being so hard on you, I just worry about you and love you a lot is what she my sister said. And so."
540.0,Provider,Does does your sister and your mom have the same dynamic or no.
11937.0,Patient,"my sister used to like not like my mom for the longest time now they're better and they have a good relationship, but growing up, it was pretty bad and I feel like growing up, it was like. it's like it. I remember that but um it was like. Now there'll be screaming at each other and I just feel like they're like don't know how to do feeling upset because they feel as if people's emotion and so. I mean that's why my sister living with my grandma since we wrote in Florida at the time, and so she the schools were really bad up there, so she came back to California. And so they had a rest a tricky dynamic for the longest time, but since I, since you moved to Australia, can you hear me."
540.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11937.0,Patient,"Okay, and so now now that's not our country, I think she kind of ground more and like has more because she had a lot of resentment and like a feeling she didn't really resolve with my mom. Okay, like perceived trauma so things like that too."
540.0,Provider,"So I mean it seems like Oh, and then I want to talk about what you realized with your sister or what you said to your sister but i'm sorry. um. So it seems like you guys when you left you were able to have that growth right."
11937.0,Patient,"Some both you guys yeah yeah okay yeah she grew a lot to since I left like since she didn't feel like she's just living for me or her children. she's like had to figure out what she wants to do for herself. And so, she had my sister when she was young, like 2021. Yes, maybe 23 so. But. Sometimes they just never feel like i'm good enough and. Whether it's for her whether it's for anything else, like one that's one of the things I watched a video on the other day about. This person who is a teachers like about ADHD in their own challenges and she's talks about like imposter syndrome. And I feel like that kind of relates with me like, no matter how good and how many accomplishments I kind of have I feel like I kind of just like. Like I don't know how to get back there again I don't know like I don't like necessarily even like deserved the amount of praise people give me for things. To like."
540.0,Provider,Thank you don't know like. You haven't like achieved their praise.
11937.0,Patient,yeah like.
540.0,Provider,Like you're not worthy of the praise.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah like I like they don't flake I was good enough or. Like I don't even know if I could do that again, even though it probably can just kind of one of those things where I know it just I think I struggle with that a lot more than they realize just not like. Like even with like doing this event, I feel like yeah that's a great accomplishment but like I don't know how I got here. And so it's just weird, though."
540.0,Provider,"And I think I mean I think that's a lot of things that we do in life, where we eventually like when you can sit and pause and then you're doing something you love that you never expected. I think you have those like as humans, we question like how we got there and sometimes we don't know and sometimes we can piece down like the the certain points that made us who we are. But a lot of the imposter syndrome, a lot of that it's being comfortable and accepting of who we are. And the things that we truly want in life so being able to take really that like self inventory and that's how you start to work on, like the that like that imposter syndrome of being able to be comfortable with. And content with what you do being enough for yourself and not for anybody out in the crowd."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's yeah that's something like I feel like I felt like I felt that the party like I like it was fun, the party that I did for and everything, but I was always it was like it wasn't like was actually that good. And so, but I always like I always have like a high expectations for myself my sister feels the same way to we were talking about it. Of like how like you just grow is hard on ourselves, and we never feel like we're good enough for ourselves were like lead with her with singing like we worked on a song together and she's like I don't like how it sounds. But they cannot good I thought it was good."
540.0,Provider,"How are you guys like like kids wise like even with school like did you guys have like this, the same like mannerism of not feeling like you weren't good enough."
11937.0,Patient,"um. I think she's always kind of felt like that. And yeah I think. I think I have felt like that, too, I think I felt like i'm always trying hard and then people see me just where i'm not doing as good as, like other people and so like. I think when it was like I would prepare myself like in high school a lot to like when I was in choir I always felt like i'm kind of in belong here with everyone else, like Jeff like I seen but i'm not like that great and so like the acapella choir I was in and. So just driven like that, like, I remember my high school teacher, we all went sincere, it was like the last concert of the year to get more of an intimate group acapella group and so. 1216 people, and so the end of the year, they were all like congratulating each other's graduating I never how how like everyone's grown and everything. And they are living like my when my best friend time James like the same and he didn't really continue with music and I have a. Like I have always kind of been more musically and he's good with music not bad it's just like we're. we're on the same level, and they all everyone like even like congratulated him, and they were kind of around a circle and then like no one really even said anything about me and my mom was the chaperone that time too, and let's see Julie yeah that was weird."
540.0,Provider,"The millions anything, no one said anything."
11937.0,Patient,"hmm, and so I like that that was kind of like I want to say traumatic, but it was hard to deal with thinking about it afterwards, but I was like didn't matter even that I was here like the two years that we've been in the group together. So."
540.0,Provider,"Well, and like those experiences they leave their mark, so it likely hit that self esteem and. yeah permanent mark on it."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah I had pretty bad self esteem issues in high school, it was it was pretty bad not gonna lie. I was like I did some self harm never really did anything more, but like once my mom found out that's when she put me in therapy and that's kind of like the first therapist they ever had, and so, but it helped it helped a lot. and nearly like that therapist not much, but. They weren't bad I just didn't she didn't feel like the right fit you know yeah but. It was a it helps me get through a lot, and then it helps me with my mom sitting my mom down talking to her about how I feel and having her listen. So. But."
540.0,Provider,"So I want to kind of go back so with the self harm, so how old were you when you started, do you like remember when like the moment that you started like thinking about self harm."
11937.0,Patient,"i'm. High School. freshman year i'd say. I didn't really actually saw all I would I used to when I was overwhelmed I was going like panic attacks will every so often that would happen hasn't recently than that, like the last. Since I broke up with my first toxic X. It hasn't really happened then, but I would like by myself, or like pull my hair because I just felt so overwhelmed and. Then, when high school and like sophomore year I remember, I used to like cut myself, but it was never anything mature bad and then my mom found out and chew like. Like really, really upset and so and, just like upset with me, too, I think, on some level, but the things she was more concerned than anything else. But."
540.0,Provider,I haven't she was probably concerned that it would escalate.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah. And I know you probably internalized it like to saying like oh my not like a good parent like this is happening or is it my fault too so. But no, I haven't actually hurt myself and like. Probably since like I was with Jordan, he would like it was it was a pretty bad relationship he. Remember, he would just make me cry and i'd be like, why are you just being mean so mean to me like. And I don't know if I told you, but it was an airport going on vacation with my family, where it was just me and him trying to meet my family somewhere. In portland relieving portland and he was like saying like stuff like oh like this, he was super insecure and who the project is and security is pretty bad thing. And he would like tell me like oh like there's one for you have just knowing like what my type is and then like calling it out and making me feel like shetty because, like he's in secure that i'm looking at someone else when I wasn't even looking at someone else. stuff like that."
540.0,Provider,And how long were you guys together at that point.
11937.0,Patient,um. Like a year and three or four months.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah you guys for pretty deep and and how long were you guys together total again."
11937.0,Patient,"Two years little over two years, I think we broke up around. I got together with him like well, I met him like January 2018 and it ended February 20 2020. yeah right before the pandemic."
540.0,Provider,"and that's yeah yeah it's crazy have domestic violence on like there's like a certain cycle for it and it increases, little by little, usually, but when coven happen when a pandemic happened it like intensified the cycle and somebody. I was working in residential so many people were coming in and, like their relationship went from like a little bit of toxic to completely just. Terrible terrible yeah yeah."
11937.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah I remember reading something like horror stories with that.
540.0,Provider,"yeah and it's hard, because everyone was at home, so there was no accountability for people to be like at school or at work, so I mean other people like family members don't really know what's going on with them, because they were quarantined anyways."
11937.0,Patient,"yeah no yeah that that's scary. yeah but no I learned I learned a lot from that being with him and it wasn't all bad I think now I think of it more fondly, if anything, even though there's lots of things that were pretty like mean like one time my sister remember telling me that we were out dancing and. Then I disappeared, and I was outside and it was really drunk and our Jordan was fighting with me and I was like well i'm just I feel like I was overwhelmed I was like i'm just wondering like die, and I was like really drunk and. He went back inside and I was just like on the side of the building outside and. He told my sister's like well where's my brother and she was like oh he's outside he said he wants to kill myself, he said he wants to call them so again uber home. And I was like what the hell. Is this was pretty mad. About."
540.0,Provider,So you guys would hang out with your sister.
11937.0,Patient,"didn't. She doesn't have the energy to keep the guy or not even like the guy. It was just like she just like into the hall, and the all the time, like I don't have anything against him I just don't like how he treats you. And so. But he always took it as like your sister hates me. This this isn't like me it's just like dude I don't even think of you. So oh yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Last time, you talked. to Jordan when was the like the finalized talk."
11937.0,Patient,"um August of 2020 you reached out, and I was kind of mad at how he did it, he was like Oh, is this your card. And he told me like the last four digits of a number, and I was like no he's like okay. And I was like, why are my in my head, I was like, why are you messaging me about like that, like, if you want to talk to me talk to me don't come up with some random excuse of why to reach out to me yeah and so. And he he was very blown obviously don't link. Because they're like what the Fuck and he's like don't like what the Fuck me and I was like but like it's just ridiculous like if it's not your car don't use it. And he's like well, I thought was my mom's and I was like well ask your mom I don't know if it's not yours don't use it and so. Cars i'm sure he wouldn't. yeah and so It just seems like a like a bullshit kind of like excuse to like try to reach out to me, and I think at the time I was already with like Dalton because i'm adult and like. The 16th of August 2020 somewhere around, then I don't know exactly, but it was some summer sometime around then and I was like I don't want to rehash this from the past, especially when i'm trying to like move forward and so. And then yeah I know his friends even it was it was really bad I remember his best friend I let move in with me and they brought their toxic. boyfriend in with her and she's like oh it's okay it'll be fine because she was a person who was so positive that was kinda like toxic positivity. Where it was like kind of like oh don't worry, we always say don't worry love bug or or this or that but she would never like. follow through with like giving sound advice and remember when I would talk to her about Jordan, she would be like oh. i'm sorry I love flow, but like he's just he's just been through a lot and like just making a lot of excuses and not really telling me that I should just not be with him kind of just saying like so. He just."
540.0,Provider,Sugar coated for what.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah and they ended up leaving me with like having a $300 like fine for the apartment they brought a dog, in which I was fine with I was just like make sure you take care of it. And I guess she surprised her boyfriend with the dog and. He didn't even really want, but the meaning, even though he was going to get a dog and didn't want the responsibility, and so they would fight about who's responsible for the dog. So they'd be like you should stains on the floor and like it was just there was fleas and that's when I was like I just have to get out and so i've been moving out before. They moved out and then I was in that was responsible for like cleaning up the apartment and taking things out, and so it was it was just a huge mess and. So I mean no I thought, taking advantage of that time to even by her, and there was just because she doesn't know how to stand up for herself in the relationship and. Also, she was trying to support him well he didn't have a job so she had like pay $1,000 for rent for both then when like he didn't so it was just it was a mess and not to come out they're engaged and I think married."
540.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah and I remember she even called her like a stupid bitch lying to him, saying that she was going to bring home weed and she didn't. And I was like that's so bad like, why are you putting up with this This is like not okay at all and just so disrespectful and I think they had a D ID, and so I don't know like how that they were pretty and they were like a former like meth addicts and they're trans boy. And they had issues they kind of had to grow up on the street, a little bit, so I had a passion that first, but then. I just didn't like seeing all the negativity and just like how it was and the entitlement to that came with like using myself like We broke my chair and no one never even said, who broke it. And it was like a really cool like share that you'd like to you can sit down and look like, but kinda like a click."
540.0,Provider,or nuggets.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah like a half a sphere, so it was it was kind of cool chair to. yeah. and So just it was just any."
540.0,Provider,ability for any of that.
11937.0,Patient,"No, not at all, and so. And they actually fought me on Facebook, because I, someone said something about like oh something about being in relationship, how was your last one, then and I was like yeah two years of how loud. And they all jumped on me on Facebook and I was like I get it, I was kind of asking for it, but like a start saying like oh no, it was it was pretty bad like it was really codependent and toxic and. Actually cheated on him because I mean I tried to leave a couple of times and that's one thing, like my sister was trying to be like like you try to leave that relationship it's not like you didn't like you would get sucked back in and so. I would, I mean I kind of got ahead of him saying like I didn't never did anything with anyone, and then it was true was a lie and. Then that continued on for like six months so that was like August we broke up in August of 2019 got back together and then last until February, when we were kind of just both done at that point, because I told him the truth in like December. And he's. still trying to make it work, but then he kind of made me feel like shit and it would just be cheap me bad and. was like felt betrayed and now it's like I understand, but we just kind of put each other through it, I see how like Tennessee with it like we were both kind of just bad for each other. And I had a lot of growing and need to do."
540.0,Provider,"Together, really."
11937.0,Patient,"um and he was an alcoholic too so alcoholic exemplify all the problems too so. It was pretty bad under the last straws that I had was I was drunk and he was drunk and I found out that this is already everyone, we knew like I can clean with everything and it was the day after my birthday and. All my birthday, I remember, I actually went on, not even a day I just hung out with a guy and we went to the beach with his dog and never told, Jordan and we were just like casually hanging out. And I remember feeling bad thing, like oh like I wish I could I wish like Jordan now looking back I don't but. That night he was on grindr looking at talking to other guys and I found out. And I was like it's not even that you're doing that that matters it's like i've all days like you were doing that my birthday. Like good like you could have waited one one way and and. So I was really drunk and I. was like kind of like not the I was digging into us like we need to talk about this like it makes me upset and like. he's like i've worked tomorrow i'm leaving my friends pick me up and i'll try and get to stay I fall into not sides like just be like no like I just want to talk about this until we're done talking about it. And he ended up he was super drunk too, and I was really drunk and he ended up throwing me off of him, and then I my head ended up getting a Pole and. Then he was like i'm sorry I didn't mean to do that, and then I was like little like bleeding a little bit it wasn't that hard, but it was pretty it was pretty decent bump and I get sold the next day and then he sold left that night and next day he kind of was like saying how. He just doesn't know if he wants to continue anymore, but like also like not really giving you an answer just saying he needs time to reflect, like. He said, if we got physical again like we weren't going to do this anymore, so he just needs time and I was like just talk to me like. don't completely ignore me like you literally like just left, and I could have had a concussion and something could have bad have geico died honestly, it was something that was worst I didn't realize, and it wasn't but just the possibility of that like if you really cared you."
540.0,Provider,Are in summer something if you had it too hard.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah, and so it was it was a it was a lot and I was still just I was so codependent time I just tried to like make it work still and it wasn't till my friend jade she's when I came down in June, July from Oregon. She introduced me to her friend AJ and he was gay too, and he was just nice to me and I was like and we actually got along and I was like wow like someone can actually be like nice to me and. And I had a couple of moments like that, throughout the relationship with Jordan, where like I met up with this guy in Canada. Six months before we broke up when I went to visit my sister and we didn't do anything but we can actually hung out his house and he was actually it was it was like rich, it was interesting he had a a. His family was like doctors and it was this mansion and everyone hung out and it was really cute and she was trying to be a doctor to and. I know, Jordan and i've actually messaging the guide to to see like if we ever did anything and so he's ever said that it was it was to me it felt like a Cinderella moment like you just meet someone and it's a blimp of the moment and it's gone just momentary interaction and. So yeah that kind of that kind of made me upset I was like, why are you gonna bring someone else into it and, like I got it, but like at that point, you should just you know, like he doesn't even look in this country he's a Canadian. we're making such a bad name for America. So. But yeah it was AJ who made me realize would be like Nelly this guy something toxic and like like a kind of a piece of shit and. He kind of just told me how it is like you don't deserve that kind of treatment and so then that's when I kind of like told Jordan. Like that we're done I don't want to do this anymore, and it kind of helps that I kind of had a crush on AJ at the time, and so and we're still good really good friends to this day and it's more of like i'm. Like I appreciate it appreciate that we never did more anything more than than that, like we were interested in each other, it just didn't work out. He was going through a lot already himself he's like I can't handle relationship yeah so it just never did but it kind of helps me segue myself out of toxic toxicity and and into more of."
540.0,Provider,Just know what was actually out there and what you deserve.
11937.0,Patient,"yeah and then Jordan actually ended up stalking and one day I remember, I was in my room. And he just walked into the House because I mean he would walk into my room from like my house where I lived at the time that was fine because we're doing. And he said, like he was like just sitting outside and he came inside and like he was drunk little bit already and I was like. You can't just walk into my house now we're not together that's trespassing like you can't be here. And then he threatened to like throw everything he'd given me out like say look in the attic room out the attic window on the lawn and I was like you can't This is my room, this is my stuff now you gotta leave. It was like well where Am I gonna go i'm like I don't care like you just can't be here, and so I was like if you're drunk like i'm sorry that's not my problem like you got yourself into this mess like. God, I am. yeah i'm like i'm just i'm done I can't do this anymore so i'm making him leave and I was just funny part was because I was talking about to my friend jaden. And so. It was just. funny.
