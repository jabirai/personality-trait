12669.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. let's see. abigail. abigail Anderson medical record 112669 or 1991. and a half ago. came to barnhart. thinking that she has ADHD. When on the criteria. With her at this point she's on an extended release 20 milligrams we switched from the twice a day because she was getting the second tablets and national has taken once a day. And she does he goes a little more focused and alert. But does go like she's tired all the time, low energy. there's like the differences are are mild. and The memory. Which is the big concern I have with our. own is only helped a little bit. she's still having to take photos of her tools to know where they the placement of her tools. While at work. In a request for a neurology console and they needed a referral from us, and so we actually did send them a referral. For Dr Warren w oh am on the 23rd. Which is almost two weeks ago. And they have not contacted her so I did tell her to call them that information i'll see if they can get an appointment set up report. He had a hit in three. Years ago, so. I really question. If that's more of her issue. than anything appetite she says. Not the same not eating any less. sleep. Around 11 what's up around two or three. And she's awake. about an hour before he falls asleep again. Which is mentioned with enough at 5am and he has to get up at six. And so, she young throughout this whole. Appointments today, she says she has melatonin gumming she wants. And they worked okay. So tell her to try them again. Before we. started no prescription medication. So right now we're going to keep the. Overall, is the 20 milligrams extended release. Oh. Okay, I sent him a prescription on the 15th. So she should have another week. yeah. i'm looking at the first on the first I sent 14 tablets, and on the 15th so I sent a 30 day supply. and she's working. Okay i'm not being."
