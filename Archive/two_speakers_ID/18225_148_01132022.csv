18225.0,Patient,Hello good morning.
148.0,Provider,morning how are you okay.
18225.0,Patient,"i'm sick still very, very tired. i'm not i'm still not sleeping. So that's been. A struggle of mine for as long as I can remember, but. I slept really good when I was actually you know, obviously so better hospital because probably the drugs. But. Since i've been home it's like it's same thing I toss and turn on I feel like i'm gonna jump out of my own skin, I cannot get comfortable so, then I go out on the couch because, for some reason the couch i'll fall asleep but i'm only getting about. Two hours of sleep a night."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay.
18225.0,Patient,it's messing with me big time and I mean this is just a pattern of mine i'm. always been. So.
148.0,Provider,Okay yeah we'll definitely talk more about that just tanya have and have you on any medication for sleep.
18225.0,Patient,"Well, no, because when I initially was talking to her, because I did you know the abilify that i'm on is supposed to help me sleep. And it, I thought that's what was helping me sleep like it when I was not at all right. But I also was taking like live libertarianism and you know all this other stuff so I don't know if that's the difference, but and I used to take tries it own."
148.0,Provider,yeah okay.
18225.0,Patient,"And then, of course, that stopped working it's just I don't even want to bother with that anymore."
148.0,Provider,Have you tried any natural remedies like.
18225.0,Patient,"But not recently but yes, I have. melatonin yeah and the problem with melatonin same thing, where I remember the first couple times I took melatonin I was like oh my gosh, this is a miracle, you know, and I would fall asleep, and then by like the fourth time it didn't work. Okay, this is kind of a theme just with my own system, I guess, like, for example. A lot of different. pain meds don't work on me very well or that's why I don't even bother that's why I always say like ibuprofen my friend. um. i've you know most of my surgeries i've had, for example, I wake up screaming because whatever they've given me, you know for pain just doesn't really I just and it runs in my family my dad's the same way, so we tend to, for whatever reason, just build a quick tolerance. To different things, and so i'm sure that's why because the transit on used to work great. Okay, no, I would take drive down and would shut my brain off I would fall asleep, as long as I took it early enough, you know I get 810 hours of sleep, it was wonderful. And then, it just over time stopped working like that you know and there, and there I cannot tell you how many nights i've had where i've taken 300 milligrams of don't ended up all night. Not even one hour of sleep."
148.0,Provider,wow.
18225.0,Patient,"Okay, so and i've also run through over the years and and i'm going to email my doctor, because my regular doctor because. You know I still have a sick. yeah and so i'm thinking Oh, at this point I probably should get tested for co, but at this point."
148.0,Provider,yeah. I think that's a great idea.
18225.0,Patient,"But I was gonna mention to him as well see cuz he he knows my whole history of like we tried different sleep medications. I am I don't even I couldn't tell you all of them, but I, there were so many times, where he's like okay now listen, this one is very strong it's gonna knock you out. Because he was trying to get me to get some sleep, because I, you know I would go two weeks without sleep. And I i'd be all excited like Okay, this is it i'm finally going to sleep, and I would get home, you know get the prescription and I go home and get ready for bad and I would take whatever you know, was the E. And nothing. or I or I would sleep for just a couple hours, so this has been something i've just been dealing with for years."
148.0,Provider,"wow okay. Well, we will definitely work on this and finding relief around this issue um."
18225.0,Patient,"Because i've also been trying to do. You know, like deep breathing exercises and like you know, because what happens is I get it's it's a mental thing for sure now because, as soon as I get into my bed i'm like stressed out. So i've been trying to do like just breathing from my diaphragm and working on, you know, like you breathe in you hold a you, you know. And it during the day when i'm stressed out, and I do it, it really works, but, for whatever reason, when i'm in bed and i'm feeling like i'm going to jump out on my own skin and I can't get comfortable. I just can't like last night that's what happened and i'm trying to do the breathing and i'm trying to get comfortable. And so what happens is I get so frustrated that finally i'm like you know, an effort, whatever just get up you know get out of bed I go walk into my family room and try and watch some TV or whatever. So."
148.0,Provider,"um. So, Kate today as part of our initial session, I have to go through some questions. Okay, just your on your background in history, we can go through fairly um and then yeah moving forward will definitely it will be geared more around what you want to talk about so i'm Sorry, I have to, I do have to act."
18225.0,Patient,"No, no, no that's fine yeah."
148.0,Provider,So do you have any questions before we get started.
18225.0,Patient,"i'm, the only thing that's my I do something that's come up is you know I have my own individual therapist. Oh Okay, so I already have been working with her for months. And we mean on Saturdays so I don't know i'm gonna just money wise like paying for these co pays. I want to stick with her on my individual, but I also want to take advantage of bright health as far as like the group and also dealing with my addiction. So i'm trying to. kind of figure that out like a schedule, you know."
148.0,Provider,"So i'm glad you're here today, because we do have to do this initial session together, so I can ask you these questions. After this, you can go back to just meeting with your individual therapist, the only thing that we need from you so i'm going to ask you to go back to the virtual clinic after our session today. Let them know you talk to me about this, you have an outside therapist you're going to meet with you're going to continue with that therapist for individual sessions they'll ask you to sign a release of information, just so we can confirm that you're meeting regularly weekly. Right getting the care, you need and then and then that way you don't have to meet with me for individuals, you can just do your groups."
18225.0,Patient,Is there any way. I could alternate it where I because right now I see her once a week what I kind of still want to be because aren't you more geared towards. See she's my regular therapist so we're dealing with more of like my trauma. Right anything. like that.
148.0,Provider,"No, I specialize in yeah drug and alcohol."
18225.0,Patient,"yeah So is there a way for me to do something, where I meet with you twice a month in her twice a month or something like that."
148.0,Provider,"So you are only required to meet with me twice a month you don't have. you're not required Okay, so in that case yeah we could just do twice a month, you know, maybe once at the beginning of the month month towards the end of the month."
18225.0,Patient,"I would rather I would rather do that because. I know my therapist name is ELISE but she because she she even though she can help me with certain. addiction issues she's not an addiction specialist. Okay she's a therapist right she's a clinical psychologist so it's it's different like we're working on, you know trauma and just different. You know coping mechanisms, all that stuff. But it doesn't necessarily always address."
148.0,Provider,We can address more of the addiction. yeah okay perfect yeah that sounds like a really great plan.
18225.0,Patient,Okay cool.
148.0,Provider,"um Okay, Kate so let's start with, and I know i've heard you know you talk in group and a little bit already so sorry if these are a little bit repetitive. With what brings you to treatment and why now."
18225.0,Patient,"Well, I relapsed. I mean that's you know first day. But even before that I, like my because i've been in therapy and finally dealing with some pretty heavy stuff. It was it, it was so overwhelming, and all I know how to do is you know I go to alcohol to numb out. There so that's how the relapse because I was just like I can't you know and then because my ex husband pulled he pulled. Getting to have Ray full custody of our daughter, while I was in the hospital that just kind of sent me over the edge. You know it's I mean I relapse twice in between hospital visits. And now. I don't know I just. You know i'm here in my apartment by myself and Miss my daughter. yeah and. I want to drink, really, really bad. But at the same time. I know that's not going to fix anything. You know, like logically I know that's The worst thing I could do. But I don't I just feel kind of helpless and. miserable and I know a lot of it is too i'm so tired and I haven't been sleeping so. yeah okay just about combo i'm sitting i'm literally drinking diet coke this morning for the caffeine."
148.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and your hospital visits that you mentioned, with those because of your drinking because of your relapses."
18225.0,Patient,"Well it's more because I. Basically, it was suicidal ideation I found out later, but. The first visit I did try to kill myself by drinking myself to death, I literally, with the full intention when l but to of vodka drank them and, unlike a four to six hour period and mixed it with to double doses of the tragedy which I found out later that trouser don't want. You know. But that was my idea at the time was to because I was so depressed and so. Just. wanted the pain to stop and I just wanted to fall asleep, and never wake up again was kind of where my head was out at the time. But at the same time I don't want to die so it's like this weird. So anyways that happened, and of course it didn't work, thank God, and then, and so I drink all that alcohol talk about like high tolerance to drugs and alcohol like i'm five foot three. Okay i'm overweight, but i'm still a smaller person I drink these two bottles of vodka mixed it with all the transit own did not fall asleep. was a. And then. So what happened was I was like for the rest of the day and kind of the night, and at that point i'm like. Then I start because I hadn't drank and so long because I, you know i've been sober for. Almost 18 months before that, so my body immediately just starts to detox and i'm shaking and just freaking miserable and that's that's the whole problem with my drinking is. In the past, when I would try and quit. As soon as I would try and quit. You know I would feel the detox effects and then you're thinking at least my thinking was well, maybe if I just drink a little bit it'll relieve my symptoms, you know it's like this vicious cycle."
148.0,Provider,Right.
18225.0,Patient,"Right yeah so here I am i'm like detoxing my hands are shaking so bad. And now i'm starting to go. Okay, that didn't work How else could I kill myself and that's what scared the crap out of me because I actually i've never been suicidal before this in my whole life ever. And so to have those thoughts and think, why would I want to leave my kids why wouldn't you know, so I had a choice to make, and it was either call 911 and ask for help. or attempt again. And that's so that was my first hospital does it is I literally dialed 911 and was like I need help and by the time they got here I mean I could barely walk I was still so drunk. I was shaking my blood pressure was off the charts like it was I mean even the paramedics were like holy crap like my blood pressure was, I think 207 over to a one. Initially, which is kind of like stroke still kind of area. So anyways went to Henry Mayo went through detox and then literally got home and the day I got home I started drinking again. So that's how I ended up. The place of pasadena. So I had to go through the detox again, which is you know it's horrible. So now i'm kind of white knuckling it, I still have to pick up the preschool tanya to prescribe medication for the cravings. So I need to go, but also this week has been my first week back up to work so i've been you know where I get busy and and then as soon as i'm done with work because i'm so freaking tired, because I don't sleep I keep procrastinating to go run my errands and go pick up my prescription."
148.0,Provider,So how old were you when you started drinking.
18225.0,Patient,"Oh gosh I mean my my parents off little isn't OK, so my dad's an alcoholic but he quit when I was born and, to be honest, my mom's that i'll call it, but never acknowledged that. She was the one that would offer to let me, you know try champagne or whatever, if she threw a lot of parties so probably around 11 or 12. was what I got. I realized I liked it. Really heavily getting into partying and drinking and abusing alcohol, by the time I was 14. And then. went through a couple years of. You know rebellion and partying really hard and drinking pretty heavy and that's, the problem is, I mean we just we cut my dad and I always joke in our family because i'm German and Irish. So, as I always say I was screwed up birth, because the problem is my tolerance for alcohol is very high. So as a teenager that's just a bad combo you know what I mean like i'm rebelling i'm drinking copious amounts of alcohol, but still functioning like I was still a good student, you know all those things and then finally. It did eventually affect my grades, because I was starting to you know miss a lot of school and things like that, and then I also kind of got a clue that it was it was really affecting my friendships. And I was putting certain friends at risk because of my. partying and just really stupid stuff that I was doing so, I actually stopped drinking. I just made a decision, I think it was like at the end of my junior year of high school, I was like I gotta stop so I did. Now, mind you, I. Back then, I wasn't drinking every single day because you're a teenager you're under age and soccer you know. You know what I mean to have access to alcohol, every day, but so I stopped and I actually was sober for a gazillion years because. You know, like it just wasn't part of my life and then."
148.0,Provider,Number four.
18225.0,Patient,"Oh gosh okay so stop drinking when I was 17. And pretty much i'll just wasn't a part of my life, for I mean even throughout my whole marriage, because my ex husband's an alcoholic so we never even had a goal in the House, even though he actually. relapsed a couple times but alcohol wasn't in the House and it wasn't part of our life. So I mean i'd have to do. The math let's see okay i'm 49 I left 111 years ago, so now, I mean 38 so and I probably started drinking again just socially when I was about 39 so from 17 to 39. wow yeah I didn't drink, I mean and the thing is like it just wasn't I was doing other I, but I also had other stuff like i've always had. Some sort of like like i've battled my weight my whole life I have a really unhealthy relationship with food, for example, like an emotional eater so, even though I was sober right i'm not drinking I did have other ways of coping some healthy and some not."
148.0,Provider,Did you have any other um did you perceive any other substance or drugs as a problem for you know.
18225.0,Patient,"No matter of fact. As a matter of fact, I actually purpose, because I had a lot of friends that you know did a lot of drugs and stuff I mean, I was in that crowd. grown up and I purposely I think. Even, even though I probably wasn't aware of it at the time, drugs scared me and I stayed away from them, and the reason was I knew i'd like them. mm hmm and I had a really good friend of mine that would do heroin. And he odd in front of me twice, so I kind of saw the uglier side you know the scary side of stuff sometimes. um, and so I just went for whatever reason, by the grace of God honestly I stayed away from drugs. I never even this is mind blowing and my friends that know me that grew up with me in high school or just they think it's the funniest damn thing I never even tried pot. And a bunch of my friends were potheads I mean they hot box, we, the hot box did a bunch of times because i'd been stuck in a car with them. But, like, I never even went that route."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so they just alcohol, that was a problem for you."
18225.0,Patient,"yeah that's why like recently, you know I found out through my oldest daughter Ashley. The my ex husband is convinced that I had a drug overdose and that i'm addicted to opiates and i'm like even even she's laughing because anyone that knows me knows I don't even bother with that stuff because it first of all, not very effective. And I don't like the feeling. Alcohol my drug."
148.0,Provider,You ever received substance abuse treatment prior to bright heart health never been in a treatment program for substance use um Have you had mental health treatment prior to break her.
18225.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i've gone i've seen there you know gone to therapy kind of off and on throughout my adult life. But I typically. You know, would get into therapy and do a lot of good work, and then it would start to get too hard, and so i'd stopped going."
148.0,Provider,How long have you been with your current therapist.
18225.0,Patient,I started with her September 1.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
18225.0,Patient,"um but you know, the thing is, I do want to mention. I said I started drinking again at 39. For a long time it wasn't a problem, it was social it was once in a while, or on the weekends, it was a gradual thing. yeah but as far as like actually it becoming a problem and me really abusing it and self medicating I mean that went on for like three years. At least three years. So before and I finally went and saw help with her my doctor. February of 2020. And then kind of a you know I be sober for a little couple weeks so that I realized in a couple weeks, but my last drink was may 11 of 2020. Up until what happened recently. But book for that. I was a heavy probably one of the heaviest drinkers I know of, and it was. During."
148.0,Provider,"You started drinking and 39 again and then how old, are you now."
18225.0,Patient,i'm 49 and turning 50 actually this.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've been drinking for about 10 years."
18225.0,Patient,"yeah but like I said, the first several years."
148.0,Provider,Okay. It really was.
18225.0,Patient,"Just more social of yeah I had just gotten out of a horrible marriage who he was always so freaking controlling. And so, when I kind of was finding myself right like when I left, and you know, I was like I want to try glass of wine, I haven't drank and since I was 17 years old. Maybe i'm not and then the thought I had in my head was maybe i'm nonalcoholic maybe I was just a wild teenager so for years, there were quite a few years where it just wasn't as much it just I wasn't abusing it does that make sense and then, but I also found myself in an. Soon after I started, you know drinking socially. into another toxic relationship. And he was a professional drummer so you know we were going to bars and gigs and everything constantly and I, and he ended up being I didn't know it at the time when I met him but. a drug addict so it was that a whole lifestyle like you know you go to these gigs and it was perfectly normal for everyone to just get hammered and take an uber home. So that's kind of how it snuck up on me was, like all of a sudden and then i'm in this toxic relationship with him so now it's bringing up all my issues, and so I I just all of a sudden started finding myself sneaking. You know, like when I was at home, for example, I started hiding my drinking. From my kids and. I started, you know wasn't wine anymore, it was bottles of vodka, and it was you know carrying it around in a mug while I was working from home. And hiding it so that's kind of where and I, and what so when people ask me how long did you abuse alcohol I can't give you a exact number, because it snuck up on me, but at least three years."
148.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and you said that you don't have a history of suicidal ideation."
18225.0,Patient,"No never done it all, I have a history of Depression and anxiety."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm but I always had, I never had any thoughts of."
18225.0,Patient,Ending my life.
148.0,Provider,Up until. When the incident when you were in the hospital.
18225.0,Patient,um oh God i'd have to go back and look at dates.
148.0,Provider,Month what was.
18225.0,Patient,"No, no, the first time was December, I think it was December 15. But I had been starting to have, I would say, maybe a couple weeks, even before that with my depression and I had been talking to my therapist about it. But up and even she at that point, it was still more, I just want the pain to stop. It wasn't necessarily like I want to die. where she got concerned was as we got closer to December 15 where I was like. I don't see a point like I don't even see a point of being here anymore. And that's when she was like you need to go to the hospital."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay so um you had the two experiences with severe really intense suicidal ideation are you feeling suicidal at all right now, are you suicidal thoughts or self harm."
18225.0,Patient,"No, thank God, I think it was the combination of the alcohol. I mean, because with my depression that's the problem it's like it's like that two edged sword right, you are, at least for me um I was self medicating with alcohol to numb out, but it makes your depression even worse. yeah so."
148.0,Provider,depressant yeah.
18225.0,Patient,"So it's just this vicious cycle of wanting to feel better right or not want to feel bad things so I drink, but then by drinking it makes my depression worse and my dark thoughts and all that stuff so it's yeah but no, I mean i'm sober now so. Thank God i'm and and also you know just sticking with therapy and working through things but that's what scared me so bad this last time was it was literally, the first time, where I thought of how would I do it. I had never even had those thoughts of any my life, putting my children through that can you imagine, I never had those thoughts until this this recent."
148.0,Provider,You would say that you want to live today.
18225.0,Patient,"Absolutely, I want to live I just. want I. I get so overwhelmed just with pain and feelings. And I want that part to stop I don't. Know sometimes I don't know what to do with all those feelings. Because i've never really learned how to deal with all that crap. So it can be very overwhelming, and so I think that's how I got to that place of it wasn't that I wanted to actually die. It was that I just wanted the pain to end. Absolutely."
148.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and do you have a history of homicidal ideation. No, and do you have a history of self harm."
18225.0,Patient,"No okay well. You know what self harm, I know what you mean cutting things like that, no, I do not mine was more. Just self destructive behavior as a teenager like putting myself in very you know precarious dangerous situations kind of the rush of you know that kind of stuff but not actually harming my body."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay. yeah um and can you tell me growing up what was your family life life, did you have something where your parents together."
18225.0,Patient,"yeah so my parents they're still married they're in their 80s now. I have a younger sister she's two years younger growing up we've always been very close, until recently, when she. When she initially found out that I was an alcoholic she actually has stopped speaking to me so that's that's been a really difficult thing to deal with. So only communicate with me through email so but growing up, it was it was interesting it's like we had a good life as far as you know. On the surface, it looks like we had a good childhood. That was a very big thing for my mom is appearances. But at a very young age. Well, first of all, I was molested when I was pretty young because my mom ran a daycare out of her home. and The first kind of memory, I have of any kind of trauma is. There was an older boy Patrick. Who cornered me. One day, and I think I I was about four or five years old, and he had to have been five years older than me four or five years older than me because he was you know in my head is a little girl, he was a big kid you know it was like one of the big kids. And she walked in and caught us because he was making me do things, or at least trying to get me to do things and instead of. You know, protecting me and getting angry with him, she actually got angry with me and told me, I was dirty and grounded me actually sent me she punished me and sent me to my room. So that was kind of the beginning of. I learned very young, my mom couldn't you know my dad always would constantly tell us, whatever you do don't upset your mother, my mom could not handle it it's a it's a generational thing in our family, but she couldn't handle. You know, strong negative emotions for me. mainly because she couldn't handle them with herself probably. But she just and yet she also was a homemaker for a long time and made our you know all our own clothes and we had nice Christmases and we you know I grew up camping and you know there's good memories, too, but I learned early on. Like my sister, and I have always joke like when mom says. How are you feeling she doesn't actually want to know how you're feeling or she says, why are you mad at me. She doesn't actually want to know why you're mad at her because, as soon as you start to say it as a kid she go that's not true. That didn't happen. I didn't do that, so you were denied so after over time, when we were pretty young both of us kind of learned you didn't actually answer those questions you just kind of went i'm not mad at you i'm fine. everything's fine. And you would just for me personally, I just held it all in."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
18225.0,Patient,"So that's where you know, and then I became very you know, looking back in hindsight at a lot of anxiety and some depression and that's how that came out with drinking and partying and just being self destructive."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, and did anybody in your home life struggle with mental health substance abuse or other addictive type."
18225.0,Patient,"behavior i'm. useless, I mean my dad."
148.0,Provider,Both your parents were alcoholics correct.
18225.0,Patient,"Well, my dad quit one right after I was born. So he's he's actually been sober for my whole life. Okay, but my mom abused alcohol for as long as I can remember, but never admitted to any kind of and the one time, I remember as a teenager I got so mad at her and I went you're just fucking drunk I was so mad. And she turned it around on me and was like how could you say because that was a thing like. She was like how could you hurt me like that you hurt my feelings and then she would run into her room and cry and then my dad who come out and go, why did you, you know upset your mother go apologize. And all of a sudden, I find myself apologizing for things I didn't even know what the hell, I was apologizing, for you know, but I do remember the one time I confronted her on being an alcoholic and she full left on me and after that I was like okay nevermind."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, was there any other. Mental health, you are aware of other than alcoholism."
18225.0,Patient,"yeah it kind of runs in our family, especially on her side of anxiety depression. As a whole, as kind of a collectively as a family, like my aunts and stuff and cousins were we wonder. It we're pretty sure my mom's mom my grandmother was probably bipolar at the very least, because of her highs and lows and my mom's very similar, but there was never a diagnosis, because my mom never. That I know have never thought any kind of help or therapy or you know and. So, but that that was you know my mom growing up. Even through adulthood, you know I always walked on eggshells around her you because you didn't know which Moody we're going to get. Right so because she's either was going to be like kind of manic. and overly emotional and. cruciate he leaves that sensitive, I mean you can't even tease my mom like regular joking around you know you deal with your family or easier, or whatever you you. The entire family knows you cannot do that with my mother she flips out so it was just a very unpredictable emotionally kind of unstable things, so I would lose myself. I was in sports, for a long time I played soccer But then when I got I got pretty badly injured and had to give that up and that was kind of my decline, I remember like that's where depression really hit in the partying and."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay um let's see here what was school like for you and how far did you complete.
18225.0,Patient,"i've only done a few college classes, so I graduated high school I hated school, but I not because of actual school, I was bullied from the for by two boys, the entire my fifth grade all the way through high school so that was tough. I was a good student, but I was never. I didn't necessarily enjoy more of the traditional kind of setup of public school, whereas my sister thrived in it like she loved to study and I was the procrastinator that would cram The night before. and get the grades like I would nail it, but if you ask but sitting in a classroom where you know the teachers kind of lecturing and.

But in our family, I was because I was labeled kind of like the bad kid and my sister was the good kid so in my brain. know you know megan's the straight a student the hard worker she likes school I can't stand school so when that therapist said that I was like gifted what the heck are you like.
