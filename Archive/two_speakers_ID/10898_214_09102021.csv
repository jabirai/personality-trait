ID,Role,Message
214.0,Provider,Kelly. you're on mute if you can hear me. well.
10898.0,Patient,"hey there, how you doing."
214.0,Provider,"I am fantastic, how are you so first of all, very much apologies. For last week snafu. Oh, they should o'clock contact I lost my total Internet service, the whole thing like."
10898.0,Patient,Oh no.
214.0,Provider,But so but yeah what are you gonna do.
10898.0,Patient,yeah technology being what it is.
214.0,Provider,"yeah but, and you know you we rely on it so much arm and then they had to cut it was a whole big what to do it took until Saturday to get it rewired and fix good i'm up how are you."
10898.0,Patient,it's been a rough week.
214.0,Provider,talk to me.
10898.0,Patient,"There was a. Last Thursday, was Carter second day in school and. They were completely unprepared for his behaviors he broke three windows. He slammed the door broke it kicked one and then he hit his head against another. room when he was outside against the glass against the window of another classroom thankfully all the kids were at lunch, so it didn't freak them out, but. there's probably like wait are the glasses park classroom is busted what's going on, when they came back. So. We gave him a second chance, he went back to bed, this is Thursday last Thursday, Friday he went in and. yeah and he broke another window we've kept him home, since we had an emergency meeting with the. School super school superintendent. he's not super he's like one step below but. And the teachers, the principal bunch of people from our therapy and support team there to just. go through, and come up with a plan to keep them safe but also keep them educated because. When we were talking to them at first they're like well, we have this plan, we had this room that's off the gym it's like a small workout room like you're gonna isolate him just you're gonna shove them in a room. yeah. yeah it's not it's not what school is, for he just gonna babysit and we'll just keep them at home, I might learn a little more but. and So yeah it's just been a big stressor this week."
214.0,Provider,"So let me just ask you the question so let's just roll back the table ready this isn't about being a bad parent a good parent was something very different, my question is this is new to him too isn't it."
10898.0,Patient,Is.
214.0,Provider,"Just socializing part right there's a lot of people now here yeah he he's at home and he's very comfortable with mom dad brother Ray like he's got this little village going on now, we bring them into a big city and he's like what the F."
10898.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
214.0,Provider,"I think i'm not all that my wife has more knowledge, because your voice and pediatric er but it sounds like the overwhelming this this is how we compensated."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah yeah well last year we actually they actually ended up going to school for a few hours a day, it is a week. They. They set up the gym as a classroom for ease of sanitation and being able to keep him safe and such as well as his brother, because he and his brother were the only only ones there. In this class. and That was in the gymnasium so now he's had sort of fixated on the gymnasium is where I have class and he kept asking about the gymnasium when we toured the school and stuff and. We took him to see the school a couple of times before. Before he started before his first day, so you can see it sort of get an idea like this is how things are going to be, but they were unprepared to for. He has strong reactions and I think then sure I thought and I thought we'd made it pretty clear like. And he had strong reactions when he was there touring the space cuz he's like you know well, this is a great classroom, but I have class in the gym now."
214.0,Provider,yeah you got going to go to the gym.
10898.0,Patient,And so.
214.0,Provider,"So I just want to be reflective of something I know this is difficult i'm not even going to minimize that but here's the thing. I want to presume, and this happens in all types of education they always think that the parents are embellishing something instead of listening to the direct communication to like yay yay yay yay yay okay so yet me right, because you didn't want to hear me. My child my child not going there, but the idea here is your on preparedness made this a volatile thing for him and it's very true yeah So what do you think the resolve is like where i'm sure you've got a million things rolling but like what what are you thinking now."
10898.0,Patient,"Well, we talked to them yesterday we've asked for to the and I asked for. Well it's in his IP that you know and it's behavioral intervention plan. He needs a one on one adult person with him to yeah save him from himself essentially that has to have a cushion with them, just in case he throws the ball on the floor because he wants to hit his head against up yeah not hitting it hitting hitting his head against a lot of stuff and. You know, to keep them safe and then they need a better space to we asked for a better space for them to give him, Sir, as a decompression space that he can."
214.0,Provider,He can vent by where he can feel safe his own. Right yeah.
10898.0,Patient,"As many stimulus is stimuli as possible damn padded. You quiet as possible, we have."
214.0,Provider,I know.
10898.0,Patient,"Dan printers for him so and where those but just a place where he can just sort of pull away and gather himself again and, but the one space they had was just a mat on the floor in a corner, which you know still open to the class. It wasn't last shelf above the space was like this is not."
214.0,Provider,Like.
10898.0,Patient,Not for him and not a good space corn. And so we've asked for that be a better space we've also. got one on one.
214.0,Provider,and
10898.0,Patient,"We worded the IP to be like it doesn't have to be a specialist. But you know it's it can be a janitor it's as long as there's an adult need, we need an adult person."
214.0,Provider,yeah we call them a to him.
10898.0,Patient,And just.
214.0,Provider,yeah they provide that yeah.
10898.0,Patient,"So what they're looking at is we had from. A member of our aba team for Carter is there as well, who said that maybe we can get behavioral technician in there to help, so the. assistant superintendent or whoever what whatever his his his role is he's a politician, you can just tell, by the way he talks. is like. So. and So he's gonna look into finding funding for another person like we'll find another person we've also said this, you know, we want to keep them in the neighborhood school but. If we can't, we need to find we have there's a couple. Schools around that are actually deal with. autism, one that deals with autism specifically one that deals with children with. developmental disabilities in general and we're like we got to get him in there yeah we're me, you know it's. 5500 a month for each student which we can't afford that so, but they need they, but they can they can."
214.0,Provider,They can pay for it yeah if it's if public schools is not not his not for him.
10898.0,Patient,We need to get into a space where he can. be safe and thrive.
214.0,Provider,that's absolutely that's.
10898.0,Patient,that's what tiffany said yesterday when when she was talking she's really good at talking really good saying this stuff without.
214.0,Provider,right because it's emotional it's very much yeah.
10898.0,Patient,"And so, she was like. If that's the only option we need to get him some place where he can he's 11 years old start learning vocations and there's one school but garish academy on. out out on the east side of the area. Actually, focuses on book actually has like vocational training it's a year round, so he would never have to leave school, he would never have vacations which always throws them off, but it kind of makes them all. yeah cuz he just gets out of the team is that routine and then changed again. and So that's what we're doing, but last night he. He was having a really hard time for like an hour, he was screaming hitting himself."
214.0,Provider,"right because he he's he's finding it difficult because he's young he hasn't gotten the tools, he doesn't know how to decompress."
10898.0,Patient,yeah so we've tried that you know each other.
214.0,Provider,I know lights down. I know you gave him some.
10898.0,Patient,"melatonin to help sort of hope, maybe help kick his."
214.0,Provider,thing he said.
10898.0,Patient,"He said his head hurts, so we gave him some ibuprofen can maybe that would help him to. And then he just. He kept like putting his hands on his ears, we read a. We were wondering if he was like. Hearing voices or something like."
214.0,Provider,"I don't so it. So when I worked at the Red Cross, we had a specialist for autism children for swimming they love the bottom, or they don't like the bottom of the food they like to go in the water. No sound no sound so he's so hypersensitive you're like well that's a whisper for him it's like a loud Horn yeah they're processing is very much very different with sound and stimulus, so that I know. How old is he. he's 11 okay so but that that is, that is a very factual thing, in fact. Depending where the autism, is it may not be in California, but they really understand. how sensitive, they are, because how they utilize the water, how they just want to encapsulate and they don't have to deal with an empty because it's I guess it's extremely stressful for them to process."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah that would have been a good idea I didn't think about that, last night, maybe because just giving him a bath."
214.0,Provider,"just give them a bath and because you know, obviously the warm water has a soothing effect as well, have you thought about medications."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah we have where. I know we have he's currently on because he saw. He hadn't EG we had to sedate him for any EG. and While he was a day that they saw a lot of activity in his brain that like that didn't seem that, to a neurology we saw neurologist who said it kind of. Almost. means it's seems like pre seizure activity to him, and so we have harder on lamotrigine for those and we also have him on methylphenidate for. The ADHD the hyperactivity. and We have PR ends available or when he is."
214.0,Provider,Sure he's.
10898.0,Patient,"escalating just can't go down but we're really reluctant because, once you start down those roads, it becomes a lifestyle almost any kind of."
214.0,Provider,"So and i'm not a medication person, but here's the thing we're probably it's a speculation, but it could be somewhat accurate we're at a point where. We have to provide him the ancillary stuff you can't provide themselves, and if we over protect him right he really will never be able to. regulate so he needs the stimulus in school, but we also need to keep them safe, so I I really and I know how schools are they're going to be very compatible taking 5500 out of their budget for him, they just saw. yeah but you know that that that that is something that they will have to do, but the idea here is. Is that the right medication."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah we have an appointment with is, we have a psychiatrist at the Seattle autism Center that. children's Center that. we're working with who's actually said subscribed his nothing who."
214.0,Provider,muscle founder.
10898.0,Patient,Is methylphenidate we also have a doctor a neurologist that we see regularly with for the remote region so we're. We got some good advice we got some people watching.
214.0,Provider,"It right now it's you're trying to find the resolution and I know it's got to be heartbreaking at best it's not even overwhelming it's just heartbreaking but the idea here is. As long as you're working with the right team they'll find the right elixir in the interim, I understand how he's going to be, but. everyone's trying to work very diligently to help him. yeah and you have to feel that too and that's probably very difficult for you."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah it's, it is nice to have that but yes, there are times when. Sure, I. Know myself. I see like our neighbors and the way they interact with their kids who are neurotypical and. i'm not gonna say it is a little bit of jealousy that comes in. In my head. of life course my son's 11 years old and I haven't had like an extended conversation with him, I have to talk in you know."
214.0,Provider,PBS you know children yeah doe quotes and kind of figure out from what he's saying like.
10898.0,Patient,That you know it's like oh elmo was feeling this way in this.
214.0,Provider,You have to associate it with something he can associate with right yeah.
10898.0,Patient,"So we have to. I know body language, I understand that, but it's there's just times when it's just like you know, I was really. yeah I never know when I first met tiffany I was really good wasn't wanting children. um and then you know I met stephanie and she's wonderful children kind of thought you know thing. yeah we talked about like now let's let's do this so we're decent intelligent human beings who were caring and you know we we should we are the ones that should be reproduced. Not to sound they'll like."
214.0,Provider,"No, I he'll."
10898.0,Patient,"eugenics but the point is is that just you know we. will produce good kids and you know we yeah we have it's just they have the job. But. You know, when you and I just had a vision of i'm coming up on 50 and i'd be helping them with their homework already showing them. You know because I was D amp D so with math tiffany's better with like languages and stuff but i'm good with math and science good about. Like showing him that it's really easy that you know. How to calculate the area of a triangle, you know it's just or find is you know just like basic algebra multiplying fractions it's just a I thought it'd be. kind of looking forward to helping him with that."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but but you're helping him in other ways don't don't. I would suggest that. I definitely emphasize what you're saying. But what i'm. What I want to go deeper in. is before you know we get to that thought of having some resentment about the decision you're providing something that he needs I know it's not what you want, but it's what he needs and you're the one that can do it. it's difficult for sure this is stressing you don't need it's it's one of those cards you didn't want to get when you all in. I get it."
10898.0,Patient,You know. No metaphor you deal with you know you play the hand you're dealt.
214.0,Provider,"And you know the unfortunate part is none of us get a playbook and there are mistakes and sometimes they're they're very reversible and sometimes they're not and we navigate the best we can, and we look for the wise but. You know I know that you had a vision, but I believe the vision is the same it's just a different distribution it's just given different because the needs are different. I mean it's will always be like this just phone it's a, this is a tough time for parents, because this is that seven through 12 the six to 14 that they're very difficult periods and really they can only rely on you, because no one else can compensate for that they just scan you know."
10898.0,Patient,"And just and that's the added difficulty is that and he's. Like he was really upset last night, and I really just. I don't what's what's wrong and you just like you're just. You he can't articulate it and i'm. i'm not mad at him for not being able to able to articulate it's just it's. As if you don't want your kid to feel that way."
214.0,Provider,"But you're feeling guilty, because you can provide. But you can't deliver something, but the delivery is not dead, because you don't know what to deliver, so you know you, you have this mixed emotion, one is you know what am I not providing into is. Why is my son this way and why, can I figure it out like it's it's a lot of unsettling things but. It. I know it doesn't feel this way, but you gotta stay the course. About you gotta rely on the professional schools always going to be. I don't know lack of better words of percent propaganda thing."
10898.0,Patient,To be a great there's going to be bureaucracy.
214.0,Provider,There is.
10898.0,Patient,That you find is that.
214.0,Provider,"It will it will eventually stable out now is just the tumultuous time. And you're going to some other things, on top of it and it's just. i'm not sure anytime would be right, but just not now, but it is now yeah how are you managing yourself don't."
10898.0,Patient,"i'm. getting through it, I feel like i'm. i'm escaping a little bit i'm just you know, and I have a chance, I kind of. it's a pure pull away just because i'm like."
214.0,Provider,"Well, you need to brief."
10898.0,Patient,"I need to circle, the wagons, you know you can't really."
214.0,Provider,"can't be in the fight the whole time it's very, very difficult you, you will deteriorate yourself so it's not a bad thing yeah."
10898.0,Patient,"So it's just it's got to be sure that i'm not. don't make it a habit like I have in the past, just you know and never present."
214.0,Provider,Right or i'm just.
10898.0,Patient,yeah they need to be sure I stayed. As present as I can keep in but still keep myself.
214.0,Provider,"yeah you know how long can you keep your fire your hand over the fire. yeah not too long right so like it's really the same thing, even the fires can hide I bet I bet to chill out for a minute. Because I won't be able to handle it myself and and you need to do that, you need to self regulate, as well as long as you're aware that you know you can do it on a continuum and. become isolated, as if nothing's really happening you're gonna have to get into the to the fight every once in a while to address it yeah."
10898.0,Patient,yeah do you think you know you can't be in the fight all the time.
214.0,Provider,"Again, no one has this domino."
10898.0,Patient,it's gotta be. it's gotta be a bell between around somewhere.
214.0,Provider,"yeah no it's it's just knock me out knock me off the 20 seconds, let me just lay there for 120 second thing I feel for you, I do and."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah and it's it's that exact feeling of just like you know you're. You know I don't I don't want to harm myself I just need a break, I was like I just want everything to stop. You know, like I could just have a day, where the entire world just stops you know. And I."
214.0,Provider,"But what's the alternative to that what's the compromise to that instead of wanting the entire day yeah I think just be fair to yourself be fair to the family, what is what is something."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah it has been it they've. Then it went to bed like early I get up earlier than he usually does and a lot easier than it usually does and. he's it's just been. I just need to be here, I just need some time where I don't have to be on."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but you need to make that happen to yeah just you're saying it and you're expressing it I validate you I want you to do it. But you, you know you have a partner, you have a wife."
10898.0,Patient,And I.
214.0,Provider,Both probably need the same amount of knockout time. You need to figure it out and it's really fair as a human being to take time out.
10898.0,Patient,"yeah it's just I can't I mean if I. I snapped snap i'm no good to anybody. But yeah that's. Because I realized this yesterday was when I was. It was when Ben it was home, you know tiffany Bennett and Carter and I, and I. It was a moment where i've been at wanted something Carter wanted something and tiffany was asking to talk to me I just. You know I. Bennett is Ben it started rejecting his started rejecting some foods that his some of his usual foods last week, too, so that's kind of crazy but he's getting him back so i'm wondering if just the. addition of school is."
214.0,Provider,catchy them so hopefully he'll.
10898.0,Patient,"Work so into it, but we have. women's the diet, with a dietitian and ot and a nurse practitioner next next week from the feeding program from Seattle children's so we're we're we're going on we're actually moving on that front we're getting some some help with that and. So, and then you know Carter was. Was Carter doing Carter was melting down I think Carter just. realized, I think he realized yesterday that then it's going to school and he's not and that kind of made him go. what's going on here because, yes, they tried to get them, he was wanting to get ready to get on the bus it's like no we're not going to send you that we can send you back yet and we need to make sure it's safe."
214.0,Provider,yeah every.
10898.0,Patient,place for you trying to tell him that I don't know it's hard to tell.
214.0,Provider,"I know, but. But was. Good."
10898.0,Patient,"I was gonna say my point was before I get too far down another another track was. Like I just said to myself, like I can't be on I just I I i'm going in. read it versus the ones that i'm look, you know my job ended last week so i'm looking for new job, too, so the back of my head and it's just. yeah I just can't constantly being character, you know I say."
214.0,Provider,"it's fine, though, like don't don't be so hard on yourself about that. You really need to. contemplate how to get the time out because what's going to happen is you're going to take it and it's going to be too long."
10898.0,Patient,and
214.0,Provider,But I don't know if you know what you want to do in your time out.
10898.0,Patient,"yeah right now, I just wanted to just. At this point, I just want to stare at a white wall or a just a blank wall for a while just I don't want any stimulation whatsoever, be in a dark room. Just quiet yeah. I mean I don't even want I. mean I love our cats and they're wonderful, but I can I sound like I don't want to pet anything I just."
214.0,Provider,"Because you you but, but I think you're reverting to something in childhood yeah."
10898.0,Patient,I have nothing to give right now and I.
214.0,Provider,Because you can't even give to yourself yeah.
10898.0,Patient,Exactly.
214.0,Provider,"So you know. If you can't love yourself and you can't. feel that you're. Providing enough and you're you're a super dad and your. super husband. You know you started to do that self you starting to internalize things is. As if you have the failure, and so, therefore, you know what I don't I don't. I don't want to be nature nurture anything. i'd rather just like. to simulate a lump on the log. Right now, because I don't have the ability to provide the tenderness I want to. and I don't even feel it. yeah I know. it's tough it's a tough this one's a tough one it's."
10898.0,Patient,"yeah and. i'm kind of skating really dangerously close dangerously close, but as close to apathy, just like. Because I know I care."
214.0,Provider,"very obvious you could you still there yeah. And then, a long run."
10898.0,Patient,"Life and just. You know. yeah and you know even the saints had took time for themselves. You know Jesus did too, and he was a hell of a sport, I mean come on."
214.0,Provider,"But, but you don't. have to provide this support you, you both need to figure out how you can do it, and this isn't like being a child this isn't being non responsible, this is about, you know. i'm going to when I bend in the when it's gonna break like I need to get away for the wind from one minute I need to be flexible, whatever whatever way I need to be, but I think what's happening is you're finding the build up with no way to release it."
10898.0,Patient,"Together speed bag, or something put it downstairs."
214.0,Provider,"I don't know I like cm see this is why I said to you before you want to do something, but the idea is you can't even form what you want to do right, so I can make a million suggestions i'd be wasting your time and making you angry, but if you can get to something. Whether it's 20 minutes 10 minutes one hour, whatever it is, even if it means a lack of sleep, I really strongly suggest you lean into it. yeah well I, and I don't know what it is that you would. want to do that would say you know what I could really this would be beneficial to me."
10898.0,Patient,yeah. yeah I can just slap my base for 10 minutes.
214.0,Provider,"yeah again in all fairness to you. We can talk about it, but if we don't do it, it will continue to. build up we've got to find the release now yeah."
10898.0,Patient,I really need. That could be my homework assignment for next week I guess.
214.0,Provider,"I would just I would I would do it this way, I would make a circle cut it up two thirds 30 minutes in each right and then say okay so i've got I got one third 30 minute blocks. When I get available 30 minutes i'm going to do one put an accident so you've already stimulated that you've done one now you got two left. You need to have a visual aid that's going to say so, this guy's telling me I should make a circle cut it up into thirds three parts of what else 20 minutes I don't care how it is cross it off in the Okay, I did that I need to do it again and I need to do it again."
10898.0,Patient,yeah the whole. atlas having the world on his shoulders he just can't.
214.0,Provider,"get no one, no one, no one and and the problem is is we don't see it, the weight, although doesn't increase, but it feels like it does."
10898.0,Patient,yeah even even if you hold a glass of water out like this you're eventually gonna fatigue.
214.0,Provider,Right and emotional emotional stress is much more heavier and impactful than physical.
10898.0,Patient,"yeah that's been. i'm actually thinking about what you said, this is hitting on the shame response, the. unworthy unworthy feeling that."
214.0,Provider,"Of course I know I know I know that this is systemically having an attachment to childhood. Because what you want to do is withdraw, but as a child, you withdrew because you had no choice yeah well it wasn't the best place to be, but it was a place that you. You function. So you're looking to find that whole again. And i'd rather you find another outlet and that whole."
10898.0,Patient,will be a little more yeah.
214.0,Provider,"It doesn't have to be productive I mean I know it could be as silly as whatever you need it to be, but yeah."
10898.0,Patient,The one good thing is that Ben is doing really well in school he's been.
214.0,Provider,"Very well, so so. Okay well that's that's actually fantastic but here's here's the the that's silver lining thing that we need to look at, although one child is having difficulties because. No one could provide what he needs. One child is successfully doing what he needs to do right yeah the flip side of that is, they both could be not getting what they need. What what double entendre would that be few. doesn't make it any better, but the reality is when we think it's all not working, some of it is some still needs to get fixed yeah. I think it's important for you to vent I think it's important for. You just to say what you need to say and you. shouldn't reserve it thinking, I would have a bias or or an opinion on it, because I think what's happening is you know you got 24 hours right. Which is time seven, whatever the hell that number is and it's you yourself right Okay, thank you for the math that's a long time to hold stuff i'm wrong."
10898.0,Patient,"But yeah 14 before he is the number of minutes in the day I remember reading a book about that years and years ago but. yeah yeah, as you said."
214.0,Provider,You don't bank them you can't bank it your own bank time you don't.
10898.0,Patient,"that's him can save it for later, I have some. sort of the great. equalizer it goes, this is why everybody deals with this yeah X amount of time, but yeah I just need to. i'll try to find some time to really sit and think about."
214.0,Provider,"Please do. However, you can formulate it whether it's a circle, I recommend you've got something else. A square columns in the quarters each each consists of 15 minutes, which is one hour now one hour together, but like if you break it down it's like okay that. Okay 15 minutes disappearing into bed or 20 minutes you know, like don't don't make it more guilt driven and you already feel guilty."
10898.0,Patient,yeah you can take a minute to read an article if you're working on something.
214.0,Provider,"That could take a minute to put your face in an ice cubes and cold water like I, and again I don't know what will help but there's always something that we never thought of that would benefit us the most yeah."
10898.0,Patient,production at least. Not productive non destructive.
214.0,Provider,"Right non destructive it doesn't have to be productive but it shouldn't be a negative behavior with a negative consequence, but it should be enough to distract to reboot the brain and that's kind of what you need to reboot. yeah."
10898.0,Patient,and yeah I really needed yeah and I need to talk to tiffany about that cuz.
214.0,Provider,she's like you do you do it's okay you do.
10898.0,Patient,I need time it's okay.
214.0,Provider,"It is okay, because the time you're asking for is not unlimited but you're not saying from now to when I go to another place."
10898.0,Patient,Which is saying is appear until I feel better.
214.0,Provider,Right and that's what I want to prevent.
10898.0,Patient,yeah or they don't really shouldn't be. Pulling that kind of stuff you know.
214.0,Provider,it's difficult I know.
10898.0,Patient,Nothing it's just I really need to yeah.
214.0,Provider,"it's it's changing your. characteristics, as you know it. But the but the answer a small part of the answer is in front of you, the problems we're finding is if we execute do we feel bad about executing are we going to feel more guilty. More like."
10898.0,Patient,You know.
214.0,Provider,I was never made to do this. This is exactly what I thought of like all these all these old things are going to keep populating.
10898.0,Patient,That make sense. When you're tired you.
214.0,Provider,"You shut down like a computer you shut down like a bad hard drive you get the blue screen to blue screen of dust and then that's it. Eric. yeah you know and it's like you gotta be kidding me I got everything on my hard drive I should I didn't back it up and down and and, and that is that is a real good parallel mirror to. What happens to us if we. don't stick to something, whatever that. Is and everybody has a different stick and I and i'm not a fan of one over the other if it provides a distraction in the reset mode then."
10898.0,Patient,"All, be it. yeah. yeah. That antisocial there."
214.0,Provider,"yeah the. The going, you know going into the turtles show mode is not productive because you're going to shut down like completely in other partially shut down you're completely going to shut down going to be there. And that's why I think it's important that you say what you feel because you need. You need to know it's okay to say things that does."
10898.0,Patient,That.
214.0,Provider,"At the moment, i'm feeling it. I feel terrible but i'm feeling, but I need to tell somebody i'm feeling it."
10898.0,Patient,"Not feeling guilty, for having an emotion."
214.0,Provider,No.
10898.0,Patient,"I think that's it I think that's what. I think we've already touched on something, because I started to remember. This sort of feeling that I would get when I would talk to my mother about how how how things were yeah I would just hold it in and hold it in until I just pop out and the. idea of. And it's the. That. a complaint complaining means you're ungrateful if you complain you're ungrateful you're not really you know you're not really. In here. You should focus on the positive, yes, and then, on the other, as a lot out there, but you can still. You know I would feel bad for complaining it's like oh."
214.0,Provider,"But, are you complaining, are you having an emotion i'm I am a little confused because they're two different things i'd like to make a lot of money. I don't know that's not an emotion that's just a financial thing that we don't have enough money in the Bank, I feel, lousy I feel like i'm not providing I actually I feel like a failure that that's an emotion arms."
10898.0,Patient,i'm shameful that.
214.0,Provider,I can't do this. Okay that's not complaining yeah.
10898.0,Patient,You know. expressing your emotions and not complaining yeah exactly it's just.
214.0,Provider,"And, and the difficult part for you in all fairness, I mean i'm. i'm a married guy for a long time. i'm not sure I want to share all my emotions with my wife, she may not be very receptive so who do I, who do I express this to it's not complaining. it's i'm going through it. And you know directly right exactly that's my point would would venting or having what I call a vomit session I think it's very productive because. i'm about to say things that people gonna be like you're a terrible person for saying that and then we hold it in, and then we got other issues."
10898.0,Patient,"As you say. You actually touched on this before, is that you know, this is what these sessions are about you are not emotionally invested. You care as a provider it's just you know you want to help me get better. As far as like day to day stuff you know if i'm. The way I feel at home if I express it to you know I can explicitly you mentioned, or you don't want to express all all your feelings to all your friends or your."
214.0,Provider,Your your wife or anything or your.
10898.0,Patient,I would not want to look at my child and say you know what I don't want to do. No.
214.0,Provider,"But see see where you are now you're getting it because it's okay to feel something it's not about right or wrong feelings on right or wrong if you act on the feeling. If you say something mean and you mean it mean that's wrong yeah but to express it to say right now i'm more than frustrated I am. i'm kind of not having. Answers i'm tired of feeling like this world. is not giving me a damn. break I need to tell somebody that but I can't tell my partner that because. she's gonna think that she's part of an issue right and again, this is not complaining. it's an emotion emotion is never complaining."
10898.0,Patient,You mean it means wrong. St because you're letting it out.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I mean what you say but don't say it mean. it's difficult, not all that we want to say will our partners, regardless of how many is it together will be enlightened by what how we're feeling. So something's we can share and that's why this session I think is important for you to be able few to whether you write it down, and then we you know when we meet you say, well, I got the following things I just I gotta get off my chest."
10898.0,Patient,Exactly Thank you.
214.0,Provider,you're very welcome all right.
10898.0,Patient,"All right, I will find. find the release and i'll try out that system."
214.0,Provider,"yeah. Give a shot this week I I really want you to. Think about it. Even if we don't. execute it. i'd like you to just at least to keep processing it. Because as long as this fluid. it's your it's in your mind bouncing around you'll eventually going to jump on it, but if we suppress it and we don't get to think of that's why I said, put the sticky note. And you're looking at it every time you look at something kind of reminds you. It may may help you launch it."
