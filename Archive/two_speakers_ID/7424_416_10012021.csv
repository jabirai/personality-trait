416.0,Provider,I can't hear you you're frozen.
7424.0,Patient,"Sorry, can you hear me now."
416.0,Provider,Now kind of you're in and out.
7424.0,Patient,So maybe I should move over there. um. Okay. um I think i'm maybe a little bit away from the wi fi is a better now.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, now I can hear you."
7424.0,Patient,I guess I might as well go inside the House I just put him I couldn't breathe inside so come on.
416.0,Provider,So what's going on.
7424.0,Patient,All I mean I had my social security hearing. The judge asked me how my conditions. You know interfering my ability to work. I had a panic attack. I couldn't say anything.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
7424.0,Patient,"I found out apparently there's this one for needs to be completed it's kind of like a questionnaire saying what the diagnosis is sometimes and what treatment i'm getting by psychiatry's or the psychiatric nurse though they're not accepting anyone else's. i'm like my primary care doctor or anything cannot complete this form. Something similar to that were completed by my cardiologist regarding my heart condition all my metal other medical conditions, you know I took it to them and they completed. But I didn't know anything about this form that needed to be completed by bright heart. How I found out about it after the hearing um so the judge gave us three weeks to get this thing done. But then I found out bright heart is not willing to fill out this form and practice literally this is going to cause for security deny me. I don't know what to do, I don't know who to contact, I spoke to tanya she says she would be happy to complete it, but Brian hard has, I guess, not willing to fill out forms and I said. I would be willing to pay for the time spent and I understand because you know it's going to take you know someone's time to do this. And I have only like four or five days left. You know this is not just like going to affect my finances for the next 15 years but i'm not going to potentially have any health insurance."
416.0,Provider,Because your social security has to be based on your mental health stuff it's not based on your physical.
7424.0,Patient,"know it has to be like collectively, all of them, because they're all you know impact each other. Of course, the judge will look at my medical condition, you know, like my heart condition all other things, but. My head mental health is also a big component and the fact that i'm young and I have a degree, and I have good work history makes it more challenging for me to get such security, despite the seriousness of my health care, you know conditions. and For years, you know my anxiety panic attacks and insomnia, triggered my arrhythmia whenever I don't get sleep several days I get arrhythmia and then I end up in hospital that's why. The last seven years I was only able to work, one and a half years, and that was just part time every time I would go back I would see you know. Could not sleep could not get enough for us inside it and I would get atrial fibrillation so it's all like tied up to each other and. Not the judge will basically completely disregard my mental health condition if this form is not completed just medical records does not do anything i'm. And with audit my chance of getting so security will be significantly reduced and I don't know what to do you know this one form is. going to show my."
416.0,Provider,Who did you talk to.
7424.0,Patient,"Well, I talked to tanya the secretary person box, the farm to medical records I guess. She received a response, saying that they don't come status. I don't know i'm. Contract do is some medical records Director or."

416.0,Provider,"I don't know what to tell you, but let me see what answers I can give you or who you might be able to talk to you about it, I wish I had a more information that I could give you, but I sadly don't um. So yeah I see why that's stressful. So hopefully you'll get that information, one way or another."
7424.0,Patient,This December my medical need to get certified and my daughter is moving out and more like that i'm not even gonna be able to get services from bright heart health either.
416.0,Provider,Why wouldn't. You be able to get.
7424.0,Patient,"Because medical you know gives you. I mean you're eligible for medicare based on your income, right now, my household is to my daughter moves out is just going to be one and i'm going to be over income."
416.0,Provider,I see.
7424.0,Patient,This is medicare.
416.0,Provider,medicare you may not qualify for medicare. But you might still qualify for what's the California plan it's. covered California.
7424.0,Patient,"I don't know it's like just so so like. unclear. Like not knowing if i'm going to get. Sorry. I guess they're. dropping for. Sure, you might want to check. i'm having a therapy session. Like I can't I can't risk. So many serious medical conditions."
416.0,Provider,Okay well let's not get ahead of yourself.
7424.0,Patient,Why just have like a couple days.
416.0,Provider,Right.
7424.0,Patient,"Okay, can you put it there yeah I didn't need like embarrass. Somebody to fill out this form."
416.0,Provider,Excuse me.
7424.0,Patient,bless you.
416.0,Provider,And you have a lawyer right.
7424.0,Patient,"yeah but she's the one who told me afterwards I was little bit upset with her also how come he didn't say anything about this, I was not aware of anything I just thought you know. They asked for my cardiologist primary care and all those doctors to fill out the form and provide medical doctors know I helped them get it, I didn't know nothing about this."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, even without the forum you're entitled to get your medical records from us, you can always. yeah for those."
7424.0,Patient,"yeah we got it, the thing is to judge needs like this assessment that she cannot just you know she's not going to go through pages and pages of medical records and make it. She just needs some you know, a specialist to say Okay, this is her condition this person, this is a mission been getting you know just basically on couple pages, he just wants to you know sit assessment, I guess, this thing of a sanction I don't know."
416.0,Provider,"I wonder if if there is no way to get you the form, at least to get you a. letter or something saying it's our policy not to complete these forms and that's why she doesn't have the letter."
7424.0,Patient,"Well yeah I mean the least thing something, because I specifically extended the time for this form because it's still not. You know. take into consideration, even if we say surpassing that's very unusual honestly i've never ever seen a provider not do that, and I would think a provider with want to help and advocate for their patients. Especially when you're just saying put whatever it is you think is the right, no, no, was telling them to write anything specific just you know document, whatever it is that you're doing. So I just been like saw like. Possibly burger I can't think anything else because of my mind I can sleep. Like my stomach burning sensation. For like I can breathe."
416.0,Provider,yeah so lots of anxiety these days. How are you using any skills that you have to. combat it.
7424.0,Patient,"Trying to tell myself it's not over, maybe i'll get it and try to calm myself down, but then this other voice telling me it's over you're not going to have insurance. You may have to leave the country, all kinds of stuff if I don't have insurance here I can't even in this country. My know my daughter is moving, which will be good for her formatting little."
416.0,Provider,swear she going.
7424.0,Patient,Somewhere in Monterey or Salinas no.
416.0,Provider,She doesn't have a place yet you haven't decided.
7424.0,Patient,"yeah well she kind of has one or two things that's you know in works, but she was so unique experience independent living before she goes to college. I mean, even if she doesn't move on now to the dynamo well. When she transfers to college so. she's. pretty much. Know beyond her own. So I cannot really depend, you know, medical, you know, giving eligibility based based on household of you know, to their their income limit it's so low. I mean what is it like. You cannot make more than 1200 just like."
416.0,Provider,My mom.
7424.0,Patient,likes to talk thousand something.
416.0,Provider,"I think that's why they've. You know they have the covered California to kind of bridge the gap between like the really expensive insurance it's out there and medical because there is in California, especially there's such a big gap in between. yeah I know people who have color covered California and they've. They swear by it and depending on your income you either pay nothing, or you pay like a little bit."
7424.0,Patient,"yeah well, I know, like man, I used to work at the welfare, a lot of times they're your shirt cost is so much that some people just choose not to have any kind of insurance I know people here. That they're not using colored careful covered California, because the plan they get for what they pays is the the restrictive too restrictive, or one day like right now medicare covers all my services. it's not restricted is not like limiting me to. This or that I mean, I have to go to the people, Linda network but that's about it, you know, and I had open heart surgery and. All the other complications I had all the er visits, it was all covered, but covered California is kind of like a private insurance almost you know how they have it's a lot more expensive and a lot more restrictive. So I really do not."
416.0,Provider,have been I had that's not the feedback i've heard about it but.
7424.0,Patient,"I was working at welfare and I will determining eligibility for medical and you know covered California cash Schadenfreude sometimes. We are now I mean my income is not that much. Because I was not able to work as long as you know, I could have why work 20 years but I was six so frequently. That and Mr like counting 21 years they counted on 14 years I mean literally down there six years I was either in hospital or out could own work. So. They just to show you. How much I can work, and that was when my condition is better than a quarter of the time I was out sick if I was working for a private company, they would have fired me long time ago, but I was working for the county in town he really tries to work with you and. and help you so that's how I was able to stay with them. I was not this bad all the time it's only been bad in the last seven years, eight years so yeah it's just. It will, I mean, as my heart, because my condition is progressing as time goes by, it gets worse and worse. So think a point where. I couldn't work more than four hours and even four hours, I ended up in the hospital like I was there for six days it took them three days to just stabilize me I nearly died. And prior to that I was in the hospital again I was even an intensive care unit because none of the medications and my organ started failing and."
416.0,Provider,"So basically, I mean given all of this, it seems insane to me that you would any trouble."
7424.0,Patient,"It is insane today, I was thinking Do I need to die, to show them I can't work, I mean who would live a job well paid job is like I wasn't making I would be making $85,000 paid health insurance benefits retirement. And I had to leave my job because I realized, I will die, you know I will not always get lucky and survive each episode, because I realized every as time goes by, it gets harder and harder for them to stabilize me because my heart is not responding to medicine anymore, so they shocked. me when medicine, all kinds of stuff and that weakens my heart so much that it takes months and months. For me to just. become even like like to the point where I can walk around or just meet my basic needs and. And there will be a time where sharpening my heart is not going to work either so. And by you know i'm going to work while i'm not able to sleep well and having anxiety depression it's only going to expedite this process just going to you know, let me die earlier. So I mean I was just asking myself like what is it going to take literally i'll have to die for them to understand that all of these medical conditions I have collectively are debilitating and their life threatening for me. And you know I chose. You know, to live, I was like I want to have you know I don't know how much time I have that. You know even. When i'm not working, my. dressing. But it is not so pressing as fast if I was working so you know I chose to live on less money. You know, hopefully. You know I enjoy the remainder. time I have on this earth. Now that my health care is jeopardized right, I mean, I have a very, very good chance of getting it because I do have a lot of medical records supporting all my physical. illnesses, as well as you know."
416.0,Provider,My exactly.
7424.0,Patient,"I have it, and they are they're okay with it there's just need this form."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
7424.0,Patient,"For everything to come together, you know."
416.0,Provider,"Well, if if I were you I would go back to the virtual clinic and ask to speak to the supervisor or Director of medical records to see what can be done about this."
7424.0,Patient,"You know, when I contacted to for them to register me for your appointment, I asked who the medical record director was and they didn't know the name or contact. Information so they just gave me the email to the general general medical records, not to the director."
416.0,Provider,"Let me see if I mean i'm trying to find that out for you, but hold on."
7424.0,Patient,yeah they were not able to find.
416.0,Provider,and
7424.0,Patient,"I had an email me Robert tried to reach out and explain. How adversely this is affecting me. You know if I had my shares, I would go back to the psychiatrists I was having before here locally and they don't have problem filling out forms but they won't accept medicare medical."
416.0,Provider,"All right, well i'm seeing, if I can find that answer out for you as soon as I find it out, if I can get it, I will. I will either email it to you or we'll figure it out."
7424.0,Patient,"Thank you so much Julie, I really appreciate your support and tonya to she was. No problem very empathetic and really sad, I have no problem filling out the form they just won't let me. Because of the policy and essential see what you can do, but I haven't heard anything from her I don't know. She said in the past, she talked to I guess contacted them regarding some forms and she kept getting same answer send our policies, not to fill out forms like. I wish, like I knew that as the beginning, because I mean people always will have some kind of forms from their employment for state disability and to say that they're not going to fill out a form this completely just unbelievable very, very rare you know at the."
416.0,Provider,"door let's get some clarification on it be here because you know, let me let's see what we can do. and get some clarification because, at the very least, I would think that we could at least give you like a copy of the policy that says we don't fill out form, so that you could provide that okay. Shelby who is Shelby."
7424.0,Patient,"Okay. I Russia the things I sign, they just say they can refuse. You know the Shelby."
416.0,Provider,awful that's who the director is so if you contact the virtual clinic you can ask for Shelby awful.
7424.0,Patient,And you like write it in the trash so I can.
416.0,Provider,yeah hold on. Shelby a.
7424.0,Patient,Good day give her like.
416.0,Provider,email or anything I don't have her email but.
7424.0,Patient,"Because when I when I call. These people, the virtual cleaning, then I really know anything I don't."
416.0,Provider,"Even I mean it's probably it's probably as. awful at bright heart health.com that's usually how our emails go but it's her name is Shelby awful I put it in the chat for you. And you could ask her you know, of course, about the forums, but if you can't get the forums, I would think the least we could give you is like something thing we don't fill out form, so that you could provide that the judge and."
7424.0,Patient,The judge that your hands are tied. Maybe they can even write a letter saying you know what my what medical you know conditions I have. You know that I.
416.0,Provider,"mean just I would contact Shelby and just explore your options explain to her what's going on and explore what your options are I mean at the very least, I would think that we could give you something about like this is our policy right."
7424.0,Patient,Your system you don't have her email.
416.0,Provider,"it's ours, the way it works is our emails our first initial last name and then it's always at bright heart health.com."

7424.0,Patient,"yeah I will definitely you know, do everything I can, because I was even seeing if I could. contact you know the director of bright heart because I really need somebody up there, who has the authority to make an exception, or you know wave this rule."
416.0,Provider,will start with Shelby I mean she's over medical records so she would be the first one to go to.
7424.0,Patient,"Okay i'll definitely do that s opal@breitbart.com. Thank you so much Julie.
