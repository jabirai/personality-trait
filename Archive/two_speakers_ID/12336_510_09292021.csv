ID,Role,Message
12336.0,Patient,hi. hi is it just you and me.
510.0,Provider,And since you and I now so well we'll wait i'm gonna wait a few minutes.
12336.0,Patient,"Yes, oh. Well okay."
510.0,Provider,"Everybody deals with. Final sessions differently so we'll see there's always that risk when you prepare people, this is going to be our last session so we'll see but. yeah you get. um yeah so we'll see I all. yeah."
12336.0,Patient,"i'd be surprised if crystal doesn't come, but that would make sense, maybe she doesn't want to like deal with the loss."
510.0,Provider,"And it's really different I like so this last week and last week as well, and you know preparing people i've been preparing people. For a while now, even though I was out that one week, and some people it's just everyone's different and there's no judgment it's just sometimes it's just tough so yeah we'll see. we'll give. Our others a few moments."
12336.0,Patient,yeah sure.
510.0,Provider,These were my checking questions and we certainly can start with these in a few. And if not we'll we'll just see.
12336.0,Patient,But.
510.0,Provider,"Hopefully, you can see them, these were the ones I was planning to do so let's. give it a few minutes yeah. And all need to."
12336.0,Patient,that's a good question in terms of whether.
510.0,Provider,yeah I love that one I haven't done that one. In a while.
12336.0,Patient,Those are great questions. Oh i'm still feeling sick from the third shot.
510.0,Provider,Are you your booster.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah but. it's normal I just right before you clicked on it was reading an article that 80% of the people who have done it, which is that they surveyed which is like 13,000 or something out of 2 million. They 80% have all had. The same kind of reaction that they had the second time mine wasn't as bad as the second time it wasn't but it's it was bad and today i'm I didn't think i'd be like awake but I walked downstairs and took my vitamins and I did wake up, but I walking hurts."
510.0,Provider,Scott it yeah yeah the second one was rough for a lot. yeah and i'm just now starting to get people who are getting their booster and their third so yeah.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah it's for me it wasn't as bad, but it certainly wasn't isn't. yeah it wasn't great."
510.0,Provider,"No, I know I the arm soreness. I think, was the most common and just yeah it just like I don't move."
12336.0,Patient,"You don't it's so like oh poor abby she always sleeps in bed with me and I think, because I was, like all day constantly moaning and groaning and, like our and because it hurts if I move on it. She slipped downstairs by the door I think she slept there she's back now, but she slipped downstairs I think it was like protect me. Oh i'm serious."
510.0,Provider,yeah dogs trust me. I know.
12336.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"They will absolutely guard and they can be in doorways that can be at the front door the bedroom door yeah Oh yes, I am well aware yeah she's."
12336.0,Patient,she's all of like 12 pounds.
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12336.0,Patient,So play their ankles.
510.0,Provider,"Oh alright well we'll go ahead and. get started, I mean I there's 11 minutes or. Actually yeah if anyone comes in, I will admit so i'll close it down so, but you want to go through the checking questions but."
12336.0,Patient,they're a little better yeah.
510.0,Provider,Let you describe your week. In terms of whether.
12336.0,Patient,"i'm. I would put it as like the weather that just last week, not in all the time. The weather that you get after a bad storm, so the storms gone, but you're just kind of like is it going to come back. The storm. So it's like the after the storm. Okay."
510.0,Provider,"so easy like after yeah sometimes what I noticed after storms it's really calm, I always. You know, because once the big weather has moved through it just seemed more calm."
12336.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,Do you feel like that's been the case more calm for yourself.
12336.0,Patient,"I do, but I also know it's going to get bad again because i'm almost out of money again so now i've got to start selling stuff in this House or go in and get the job post office which I haven't applied for it because I can't move. Next, next week today's Wednesday, so I can apply over the weekend, and I still need to apply and going to do today for the unemployment it's just that I don't I still have 12,000 in there, so that's my storm that's about to brew but oh. i'll work on it. Okay yeah."
510.0,Provider,"What was your second question, second one, and you might have to think about this and come back, because when you have to really think about. Oh, when did I stay. Calm well everyone out seemed impatient judgmental or distracted can you think."
12336.0,Patient,"This is a great. question because, for me, literally everything almost almost everything since torsten died, I have this weird like reaction now I am. i'm like common I don't care it's weird I don't it used to bother me when other people would get upset I either walk away I don't reply to their text or email. I just like because there's always drama going on there's drama going on in my Hoa right now, because different people are doing updates on our home and it's noisy well you know what that's like that. So one of the neighbors was like getting really riled up and I just ignored it i'm right here too, so whatever I didn't care."
510.0,Provider,"yeah you're relating to it differently right. yeah i've talked about that, and it is such a powerful lesson like. yeah I really do have the choice here to TAO i'm gonna respond do I want to respond in the same way I normally do or do I want to. yeah yeah. that's what."
12336.0,Patient,"My biggest thing that I want i'm going to try and put this in because i'm getting hot arm hurts. i'm going to try and keep that forever, but i'm worried because I was really, really not react out not reactionary like but. I don't know I just always everything I don't know I couldn't take myself out of it and just distance myself from drama, I wanted to fix it or I wanted to help her, I wanted to like I don't know end it whatever the problem was now if it's not my business I don't care. I really don't. If I can help you in a way that's okay with me i'll do it, but I don't really care. i'm not not empathetic because i'm still empathetic but. i've learned that there are bigger things to worry about like death, for example."
510.0,Provider,"yeah why think you're sort of in the mode of soda just attending to yourself and there. yeah and that's not a selfish thing you're just really in this mode of a need to take care of myself. So I can maybe be of more service to others, but when we're completely depleted we're not good for anybody. You see, I know, parents right when they get so depleted like you've got to be a holding environment for your kiddos right if you're falling apart you. Know they're relying on you right and you want to kind of make sure you have that that energy in that presence so yeah I think I think you're just this is where you're at and there's no judgment it's like I need to tend to myself and my knee. yeah good. Now we started talking about this, but i'm it's more specific to group."
12336.0,Patient,what's the most helpful yeah.
510.0,Provider,lesson or topic. You had while here at bright heart how obviously it doesn't have to be in my group because you also have another science group but has there been a. topic that you think has been.
12336.0,Patient,"super helpful yeah the anxiety. The exercises i've learned in my other group on anxiety like there's a bunch of different ones and everybody in there has anxiety, it seems like so. We all like talk it's so funny because I made so much fun of it, not in a bad way teasingly behind me when I first signed up for bright heart and I found it had a good group therapy. I my joke to my friends, was what are we gonna do like share different ways we can kill each other or kill ourselves. And it was a joke, and then. I read now I tell everybody like you know what that's my favorite thing I like. Learn so many different things, and it helps knowing that other people. are going through exactly what you're going through to like I can relate to them and I don't feel as alone. So it would be the the techniques for dealing with anxiety, I know i've learned like four different ways or five and the idea come right to my brain that and you saying just sit with it or be with it i'm like okay. I do that it goes through my brain all day long."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you're really internalizing a lot. of strategies, I love hearing that. Well, the show and tell we. I mean, I certainly got. to watch your video we'll see."
12336.0,Patient,"I don't need to see it actually again. I started after I sent it to you I started to watch i've only ever watched it like. i've only ever made it through it twice, I think. yeah ever um i've watched it full twice, but I never make it for her and I didn't make sense to you. And just thinking about it, I don't really want to watch it today."
510.0,Provider,"You don't have to. it's okay. it's okay if it's just you and I went yeah. Now I will want to give you this oh yeah Jesse. Is the therapist it will be taking over the group next Wednesday same time. same station none the differences. It will be her zoom ID for the group. Oh right is that. The link, if you want to."
12336.0,Patient,make a nice yeah hang on. i'll take this and just screenshot it.
510.0,Provider,yeah and then.
12336.0,Patient,There I got it.
510.0,Provider,"Perfect all right so um that I think is the last. There of vr yeah so. You you got the floor, I mean I know we sort of already. But. yeah me if there's something you want to talk through or. I was going to give these are my other recommendations to that i've been giving out, I mean I keep getting this question and. It came up in my groups yesterday they're like do you have any final book recommendation so um I was planning to give these in today's group at the end, but these are my sorry just. A screenshot if you would take another."
12336.0,Patient,Know yeah.
510.0,Provider,There are some books. That I personally just love adore there's so many I mean I could list.
12336.0,Patient,"It feel that it's great The other thing I wanted to get from you again, is the website that had all the different. tools, it was interactive it was a website that."
510.0,Provider,"yeah oh yeah let me, I have to look on my phone I have it on my own phone."
12336.0,Patient,And I yeah I forget.
510.0,Provider,about this yeah it's called my life.
12336.0,Patient,my life I don't think was that what you told me the other one okay. All all a.
510.0,Provider,"screenshot there's that one. And there's an I don't think. there's also, this is another common APP that I give out i'll give you both just to. Now, Sam Harris he's a neuro psychologist he's just an amazing mind, he has an APP called waking up with Sam Harris, he also has a podcast. Okay, talks about lots of different things, some of it incorporates mental health. A lot of times, it does, but those are the two common Apps that I tend to give. The my life has some great meditation now obviously this goes without saying, the insight timer calm my headspace Those are all really, really good to that I like the."
12336.0,Patient,Only think it was headspace that you said. I think headspace was the title.
510.0,Provider,"yeah so calm and headspace and insight timer those are the top three that I really like little they're they're all the same, but a little different right there. yeah trying to differentiate but the, the idea is providing meditation practices, and you know really just sort of educating you but also prompting and taking you through actual practices. And summer about gratitude summer about anxiety summer about depression priorities so yeah they're they're great, but those are the other Apps that I tend to. To give so I keep getting these questions and my groups yesterday and i'm like Oh, you know what i'll just have sort of my go to."
12336.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,hearing some parting. parting resources. yeah yeah.
12336.0,Patient,"i'm trying to think if there was anything else that I wanted to ask you. i'm like sweating right now, because it's like i'm like still sick so it's like."
510.0,Provider,"I know, and I mean I mean no pressure I mean we had. Technically, our last session."
12336.0,Patient,"I know. Yes, what I. Do was just stay until 930 anyway because i'm not feeling great I. took the dog yet so when I got here, I was gonna say. Can we can I leave at 930 but I don't have to. Like leave this therapy. It flipped over but yeah I don't have to be gosh there stay. I know i'll just look at it it's so much headroom but i'm like whatever it's on a little stand. yeah um okay so i'm trying to think what my biggest fears are right now my biggest fears are well the money, but I can figure it out."
510.0,Provider,"I think you have a plan, I know."
12336.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,I do it's just a matter of taking those steps and getting the application in and.
12336.0,Patient,yeah it's gonna suck. I don't think about working part time. I don't know I don't want it work. socks. Oh well.
510.0,Provider,Probably part time might be. yeah more of the speed sort of getting a routine yeah.
12336.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,The post office I think that's the first time I heard post office. I think you'd be really good and there's lots of different.
12336.0,Patient,"types because it's not going to. require much like from me i'm not gonna have to brainstorm it's going to be everything's going to be right there for me like when I write or produce or anything, it requires a lot of my brain and I."
510.0,Provider,Just.
12336.0,Patient,I don't want something that. requires too much of my energy so i'm assuming with the post office it's probably very like regimented you come in clock in do your thing and leave. that's why n plus one of my neighbors is she has a good job at the post office and. She told me she could help me get a job if I wanted.
510.0,Provider,A neighbor okay.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah. But, as you can tell i'm thrilled."
510.0,Provider,"I know you'll need to take care of yourself, I know you also talked at one time selling your. window."
12336.0,Patient,But yeah but know what.
510.0,Provider,was like they want to stay and yeah get just income to turn a where you're at yeah yeah.
12336.0,Patient,I think if I sold it right now. I would just be so last.
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah cuz where you'd have to live somewhere else that's the reality so.
12336.0,Patient,"I don't have money for rent rent would be less than oh yeah no rent would be a little bit less than my mortgage but if I could reply, but I can't reply recent job."
510.0,Provider,yeah I see.
12336.0,Patient,"They actually called. Mortgage company, the other day, and ask them and they're like no you can't unlike i've been begging you guys. For two years i've had the mortgage with them for eight and i've been begging them for two years to refinance and they won't because I don't have a job and, like you, guys would make my life so much simpler, because it would take my mortgage down 1200 dollars a month."
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12336.0,Patient,So that was the other reason for the most office.
510.0,Provider,yeah exactly then you'd be able to do it and then that will.
12336.0,Patient,know.
510.0,Provider,When I think again Lee.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah, but when I called him, he told me if it was a different feel than I worked in before that it's a year before you can refinance to two years."
510.0,Provider,wow. So they have. Relations goodness gracious.
12336.0,Patient,yeah if you go back into a job in your own field six months but it's it's a job in a different field it's one to two years.
510.0,Provider,"I just seem so arbitrary. i'm sure that yeah you hope there's a reason that it seems somewhat arbitrary. yeah job frustrating well I guess it's probably to avoid people doing what i'm going to do, which is turn around and."
12336.0,Patient,"quit. You know, because I know I can pay my own mortgage and never going to let my house fall into like foreclosure."
510.0,Provider,yeah.
12336.0,Patient,"If I can avoid it. Like that's not something I I would sell it there's no way that would happen to me because I only oh 282 and it sold for 835 i'd never lose that I could flash sale it, you know."
510.0,Provider,yeah no no biggest asset.
12336.0,Patient,You want to make sure you purchased on.
510.0,Provider,It sounds like you will do all that you need.
12336.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm not gonna lose my house.
510.0,Provider,"No, no that's your home base to, and it seems like you've really kind of moved and shifted some energy to kind of continue to make."
12336.0,Patient,The new bed free will comes tomorrow. yeah. It.
510.0,Provider,actually going to take your old one away.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah, thank goodness, and this. I feel a little bit badly, but this mattress because the only thing wrong with it, is that he peed in that a couple times. But whatever. I mean, I feel badly for people who don't even have the bed. And somebody could have this, but maybe they'll take it."
510.0,Provider,"Well, you people by often those toppers. That can go yeah have a mattress and it's exactly yeah."
12336.0,Patient,"i'm not gonna keep it, though."
510.0,Provider,I don't know I think it's good you're letting it go I think you're ready to let it go.
12336.0,Patient,yeah hey it's time to.
510.0,Provider,To have a another shift in that room yeah.
12336.0,Patient,yeah maybe i'm I think i'm also I mean I don't want to make you feel bad i'm gonna miss you.
510.0,Provider,Okay.
12336.0,Patient,I know i'm you know your baby.
510.0,Provider,"yeah it's another transition and, in some ways it probably feels like a loss which can sort of."
12336.0,Patient,It is.
510.0,Provider,"It is a loss, but it is different, but I know. It kind of. You know ruffles those those. nerve endings doesn't it."
12336.0,Patient,"yeah. Just because i'm already lonely and I had somebody who like to talk to. Somebody else you're not that easily replaceable, though."
510.0,Provider,"I know you've been very kind with your feedback and I do think Karen I know you're not one of my groups that she shadowed me. And the two groups she's taking over and all those patients will be assigned and there's a handful and you were one of a handful that aren't in my groups but got assigned to her. And she lives in the Bay area, so I got to meet her that I get to meet her yesterday so she's she lives."
12336.0,Patient,In better oh yeah she.
510.0,Provider,"She was shadowing my groups and she lives in the Bay area, she has a dog and. Lots of experience and substance abuse and mental health. And I think I think you'll you'll be able seems very approachable and open. Including names. So I think you're going to be in good hands, I know it'll be different my style is different and i'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I know you really resonated and felt like it was a good fit and I know."
12336.0,Patient,"That because you're intelligent and you. You know, like not everybody in therapy is intelligent then it's hard, because if you're way more intelligent then. You don't get as much out of that, and you just knew so much more like I think also it's because. I feel like you knew your you know newer things and things change so much and often I have older therapists and I don't feel like they have always known. Things that changed like even torsten with dermatology I used to say to like what are you doing like dermatology is blowing up and you're not doing anything to stay on top of it or up to date, I said we could go to conferences and stuff it just wouldn't."
510.0,Provider,Oh yeah and that's a big part of I think in any profession definitely in the mental health i'm always taking seat us i'm always trying to.
12336.0,Patient,Like.
510.0,Provider,You know cuz trauma right just take the word trauma there's so much new stuff that comes and i'm always fascinated by trauma and the brain and how to help.
12336.0,Patient,need to.
510.0,Provider,"yeah and anxiety and and i'm i've been trained in mindfulness meditation it's big part of what I like to do but definitely for doctors right, and you have to stay sort of current and maintain, but you want to stay, you know moving into. The new realms oh wow I don't know if you've ever shared that so he he just really was not interested in that because I thought dogs had to do sort of continuing ED to."
12336.0,Patient,"They do, but what he had done. right before he met me he had done something where he was going to be certified for 10 years like it was a 10 year certification. Okay."
510.0,Provider,So from parameters okay.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah and so in the 10 years I was with them, he didn't go to one single thing, and I was like his heart wasn't in that he got to a point where I. Really cared about was drinking."
510.0,Provider,"yeah and that's that's the hard thing to witness, and you did this where. It was horrible arrive, and the intention was the alcohol and nothing else, and the casualties that fell right. You asked him. Well, exactly you would have been another casualty if he had remained a lot right you're in the."
12336.0,Patient,process of know he would never have left me but. I was. You were trying to I was.
510.0,Provider,Already in a more. casual day.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah I would be right, where I wanted to be I would be moving great they'll. Just like threw a wrench and all my plans, I had worked from Sep tember until March in a therapy Group and It was all online though it wasn't like."
510.0,Provider,You talked about this yeah. yeah good really supported you are ready. To ship life. Life is life yeah.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah whatever I just need to get back to where I was. Like before he died yeah you're getting there, but you have to heal your healing your."
510.0,Provider,mean you are literally attending to the wounds. yeah.
12336.0,Patient,"And then Christian I knew something I wanted to ask you about Christian i'm. Remember, he had sent me that really shitty text and. So I took it Joe hello, my friend in her 70s, has been my friend for like 16 years the one who bought the bed, and she. She read it, and she said that it's so funny because I hadn't even told her what I was thinking and she read the text message. And she was the only person who read it, the way I read it, I mean it hurt me and but once I stood back and really looked at his text. It told me he has a secret and he doesn't want to tell a secret it's all that text said I can send it to you again, but I showed it to Johanna and she was reading it she's like. She said that she was like Lisa this text is saying, I have a secret did you know, I have a secret, I had a secret before i've still got a secret you don't know my secret. i'm not going to tell you my secret like that is what it was, and so he's got this guy remember, I told you about the guy but he had a guy. in Kansas that he had met online. That he had gone to visit and hadn't told anybody about. Well, the guy is. At his mother's house with him right now, and like i've sent it i'm not sending the text today I send you a text every day since the kids been here just high or whatever."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12336.0,Patient,"And he's like he doesn't want to introduce his kid to me, I can tell like I didn't I didn't say that I just I made it all casual that's why i'm not gonna say anything today. i'm yeah i'm just gonna let it go but it's like and I thought about this all day yesterday, while I was on bed, I was like you know what i'm getting myself prepared to not meet the kid you know to just like him not let me and. It just it's just another thing take it away from me, because I had three steps, I had a husband job. I don't even know his steps and. I have like mason texts me."
510.0,Provider,"And if I texted event yeah you were talking about yesterday, though, that there has been some."
12336.0,Patient,"yeah Nelson it's. yeah mason did just randomly reach out to. and Christian I guess. In my gut I think the guy is gay, but I don't know i've never met him I, and I said to base and I sent him a text him like hey did you get to meet Preston. And he wrote back yeah. Just just for a minute at dinner he goes he seems pretty conservative and mason mason torsten and I were all. democrats and Jennifer his mother not person's mother she's she's the same as US i'm Jennifer and his Republican and she's turned Christian republican which sucks ass but that kid is not he's a democrat in his heart but. Anyway, so I don't know, I have a couple friends who are gay and Republican but it just doesn't make sense to be gay in republican you've got everything going against you."
510.0,Provider,"I wish we had. More parties, I think that dichotomy oh."
12336.0,Patient,My God yes.
510.0,Provider,"Yes, it's it's more complicated than two parties and."
12336.0,Patient,A lot of reasons.
510.0,Provider,A lot and it's really hard that we we seem so pigeon holed and that's creating such this division it's. I didn't know a.
12336.0,Patient,Great point.
510.0,Provider,We need more choices and just have. To is. is not enough.
12336.0,Patient,"it's not it's the same in. Canada, though, we only had to I mean we have independent ones here, and when I was younger I used to think that, but then I guess when I realized how politics really works here. yeah I just forgot about it, but there are."
510.0,Provider,Other bar but not.
12336.0,Patient,Not enough things that.
510.0,Provider,"are competitive it's really we are. All should be two party system we have we have a lot more, but they're not given the forum it's we're a two party system and it's. it's there's more nuance and not everybody wants to be pigeonholed in one or the other, and there's things that I actually liked from the Republican Party, but. I actually did test and then there's things I absolutely hate about the Democrat and then I really love then yeah i'm an independent now and, like I where I belong."
12336.0,Patient,"i'm independent to i've never chosen. A party and I do only watch CNN, though, because when I watch fox it seriously disturbs me because it's flat out lying. If I was, I come from news."
510.0,Provider,My background yeah I tend not to watch it I feel like they're they're selling a narrative on.
12336.0,Patient,The boys are the.
510.0,Provider,"Absolute both sides, and so I tend to be really strategic of what I read and sure."
12336.0,Patient,"And I agree with that, but here's here's my thing. The way my point was no forget it i'm."
510.0,Provider,on fox news yeah.
12336.0,Patient,"don't yeah My point is yes they're both they're both going their own direction, I will totally agree and I disagree with that they're not supposed to like as a newscaster you're never supposed to have a side, even if you do you're not supposed to show it. Right so they're both in the wrong, but when I put fox on every now and then I my mouth drops, because I think like I want to like send them a legit news article and say what you're saying is actually completely false like."
510.0,Provider,"they're they advertise as an entertainment channel. There in. That status. With it, this is how the disinformation and distortion."
12336.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"it's allowed and a lot of people will watch it going, this is. fox news or the other, I."
12336.0,Patient,couldn't understand how we would fit but that's how you're right.
510.0,Provider,"amen yeah. yeah yeah I know I know it's it's a complicated world we're living in and not that back 20 years ago 200 years ago there was still propaganda and the narratives and what they're trying to sell just but now the imminent release of information, whereas back in the day."
12336.0,Patient,Yes.
510.0,Provider,The printing press took a while right.
12336.0,Patient,yeah you know when I read news.
510.0,Provider,amy yes and it's viral and it's. yeah me and hacked it's just. yeah.
12336.0,Patient,yeah and try not to I when I first caught up and reading the news in 1995 there was a. There was a machine that you had to crank to get the teleprompter I used to run my.
510.0,Provider,own yeah for now it's like. within seconds.
12336.0,Patient,Things are blow I would run it in my own teleprompter.
510.0,Provider,uh huh.
12336.0,Patient,cuz it was small small station.
510.0,Provider,"yeah I want to get back into the news I know it. yeah I would enter to, but it seems like when you talk about that there's an. there's a light that kind of comes up in you, but I know. yeah I don't have that."
12336.0,Patient,"is just energy I don't have any. I don't have any. Real any footage that's in in the last decade. Only footage just like. More than a decade old I need I need stop on a real to get a job. I don't have any way to get stuff on a real well, unless I did it myself, which is honestly what it was thinking about doing with tick tock i'm just wait not there yet. And to be."
510.0,Provider,"more of a long term goal. Right don't yeah don't push yourself to the point where, then you you start to ruminate and worry oh my God i'm never going to do it, I think you."
12336.0,Patient,can eat right.
510.0,Provider,"you're in this mode of taking care of yourself, you are still fresh off a significant devastating loss. And many losses. Not just him there like you just shared earlier, I know yeah I."
12336.0,Patient,"heard, but I would love to do that and, obviously, in my heart, I feel like. I will end up back in that field somehow whether it's tech talk I, I think it might be tech talk because that's what I I am relating with the most. I don't know it's weird when I think about that I know i'll be happy doing that, but. I guess it's because I have to say goodbye to this. And I should it's not like i'm having fun. But. Yes, i'm not ready to like. To move forward."
510.0,Provider,"you're having to sorta, and this is where a lot of our when we have such intense emotions or we're sort of fighting the present moment right and you're still trying to accept. The present moment torsten is not here there's been a big shift with your step sons. there's been a lot and and trying to really accept this present moment, and this is where i'm at but also being able to recognize. You have the strength and resiliency it's just I know you're you're feeling like it's hard to tap into at times. But you have been doing it because you just shared it yesterday, no, I know, and I know you're not feeling well too, and I wonder if that's just sort of sometimes we don't feel well it just sort of. damsons and impacts, we sort of feel vulnerable. And we can sort of sometimes be a little more emotional, do you think that. could be plan set today."
12336.0,Patient,"100% like I said I. wasn't feeling good, and I was gonna say like. yeah let's just do 30 but. I appreciate them coming yeah. Thanks I well i'm glad I did actually to be honest, now i'm like well I got so much more out of this even though i'm crying it's helping me. yeah just ignore the tears no I love talking to you, and like I tell everyone. The loneliness is the worst part like and I don't really want to be around anybody so to worse like. I could, I could make plans every single day with people if I wanted I have friends, but I don't want to."
510.0,Provider,yeah.
12336.0,Patient,i'd rather be alone.
510.0,Provider,"I think that's you recognizing that you, you do probably need to be alone and some respect and continue to attend to yourself doing yourself care and reaching out when you're ready now I don't want you to be isolating, to the point and then. Oh, are, though. I don't think you are, I think you're being more. intentional about how. Yes, you schedule, because you're recognizing when you kind of over schedule yourself, I think it tends to be an avoidance. yeah and I think you're now slowly I know it's uncomfortable but just allowing yourself to kind of sit with the emotion and it, it will pass through you, it will, but I think you're just learning to sort of be alone with your thoughts and emotions, I know that's not easy at all."
12336.0,Patient,"Well it's better when you have somebody smart like you to talk to because, why not Joanne I can talk to, I will talk to Joe hit until later, but. I don't know you have different people in your life for different reasons. head into whatever life let's I know I. Thought I what your."
510.0,Provider,Life here like Do you still feel that way like yes.
12336.0,Patient,"um I always I always think like, if I have some purpose here. tell me what it is like don't just leave me hanging i'm talking to God not you. or whoever, but this is just doesn't make sense to me it doesn't make sense Why do people have to go through so much pain and I look at people like I met the sweetest homeless man at the pharmacy the other day, when I went to get my booster shot. He was blind he legitimately you could tell it could only see it, a one eye and. As I was walking in he's like hey do you have any change. And I don't ever I rarely give a homeless person money because I I don't know what they're going to use it for, and you know I would give them food or something like that so. He goes, do you have any change and I looked at him, I really legitimately had $1 in my purse and I said i'm so sorry I don't and then he I go. I don't have any money and he goes and he was the way he said it was so sweet goes if I if I had some I would share it with you. And I knew he meant it and I looked at one ago a women and the booster shot they came back, and I said, you know what when I went in. You told me if you had money, you would have shared it with me and I believe you so i'm giving you my dollar and. He almost started crying and then he started like talking to me and he's like I don't do drugs and I don't drink and. He showed me his feet, which were a massive shoes were breaking and then I remembered I had an $8 and 67 cents subway coupon or. card, and so I gave it to him and I felt that he was like he didn't believe me that it actually had money on it, and he was it's not it's not you I just. People have done that to me, and then I go and there isn't any money, and I said, you know what I totally understand, and that would be more finally embarrassing. Let me call the number right here in front of you, so I dialed it on speaker and it goes, you have $8 and 63 cents I go I gave it to him and I go there you go $8 and 63 he was so sweet anyway, so I left him so. I have a heart, I care, but."
510.0,Provider,"I know you do, you are a healer and yeah I think you're an empath I think you are very much an empath and I think you're trying to you know learn the ways of being grounded and. Not kind of immediately though kind of take on everyone else's energy and you're just sort of firming up your your boundaries and that takes practice Lisa I mean it it really does you."
12336.0,Patient,It is a heart.
510.0,Provider,you're very empathic you're very compassionate I mean just listen to the story you just shared.
12336.0,Patient,"He was so sweet, though I kind of want to go isn't it was a Tory at our why and. kind of wanted to go and give them like a blanket or something today, but I don't know, I have a lot of extra blankets. Like you didn't even have a blanket his shoes for falling apart is. Be or like being alive by like something that made me feel bad because in the past, I could have come home and got a cream from torsten and taking it to them. I want to give them. A sucker to happen."
510.0,Provider,"I don't know well, hopefully, he can I mean I know la has lots of different resources. For aware of. Some of."
12336.0,Patient,"Your mask and it goes, they will give me a mask do you want me to die, and I went well I don't want you to die and i've got extra tasks, let me go get some. Because torsten had boxes of masks and when he died and kept them and I I reuse them because I barely go out, so I gave him like 20 of them like here you go give them to your friends don't lose them."
510.0,Provider,are quite generous. And this person.
12336.0,Patient,"Well, he was somebody who needed to help these like yeah and when you set boundaries, like, I never knew what boundaries, for I never even heard of that terminology until torsten got his first dui. And I had to go to like. couples therapy for his in intensive outpatient Program. Right and that's when the first thing the therapist said. to both of us and I hadn't even met them, they just knew torsten they're like you guys need boundaries, I was like it's a boundary. I didn't know and now that I know what they are they're amazing I love them torsten hated that once I started using boundaries that that also led to his end because he couldn't take it anymore, because I. never said I was meant. yeah like what I would put up with and I never did that, before and I and you're right, I do with everybody now and. that's why everybody comes to me like when they're upset because I used to like get involved and help and try to fix it I could care less now I don't care fix your own problems like I don't care i've got my own problems."
510.0,Provider,yeah I think you're learning that boundaries are really needed.
12336.0,Patient,"they're very, very."
510.0,Provider,"Everyone and and that that says a lot when you were introduced to that and you're like oh yeah no I need this and then. didn't. He wasn't that's what happened ends in relationships right they the the boundary start to shift and not everybody is on board and. And absolutely yeah that's that's the tough thing to witness, and you, you watched it in real time, but you also watch pure addiction, where even losing me, you know, having legal issues lots of other things happening for him the addiction was paramount and it was."
12336.0,Patient,"I mean God when I clicked it this House God. bottles of either empty half empty. Vodka like broke my heart. In fact, one of them that I found I put in my freezer and I was just I was thinking I didn't want it, but I was thinking if somebody ever came over, but you know what I want to throw it away today. I don't need blood in my freezer."
510.0,Provider,"yeah he he really I mean he was consumed by it and that's what addiction does that's. that's the sad part of addiction, the disease it literally takes over and torsten probably wasn't even the torsten that you really knew."
12336.0,Patient,"Towards the end, though, and I used to call his mother and I used to say that to her, I would say, like. he's not porcelain anymore, he wasn't."
510.0,Provider,The addicts and took over taking.
12336.0,Patient,"Just control them like 24 hours a day, he drank."
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah and he net remind me he never did like Inpatient detox residential any.
12336.0,Patient,Patient.
510.0,Provider,"Up yeah and it sounds like his level of us he needed like he needed to be like enough 30 day residential to kind of basically detox and then slowly re enter, but so often, I mean they."
12336.0,Patient,Work on.
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yes, I have some awareness and buy in it sounds like he didn't."
12336.0,Patient,"He gave up honestly he knew he was killing himself, he gave up."
510.0,Provider,yeah and it's so kind you witness that in real time yeah.
12336.0,Patient,wants to kill himself.
510.0,Provider,"It was a slow down but yeah the alcohol just took over. yeah i've always. said after working in. The er and I see us on doing psychiatric alcohol is the most dangerous drug on the planet, it is because it's accessible it's legal affordable for most. And I just the eye and I saw all sorts of drugs right people income in an er an icu and, to this day, I say alcohol is the most dangerous drug on this planet and be careful because some people can drink and others can walk away and others can't like and torsten."
12336.0,Patient,"Know early. yeah mason's like that to mason is going to die, probably in like 10 years i'm sure he stopped xanax but I asked him if you still going to the laker game first birthday, on Sunday, because he turns 21. and He said no he's thinking about going to Las Vegas. So I just went oh. Whatever it's his journey."
510.0,Provider,"It is, I mean, in that, and you see you're learning that boundary like you can still love some I met you can't always rescue them."
12336.0,Patient,"Oh, my God that."
510.0,Provider,Law.
12336.0,Patient,"i'm so glad i'm still on with you, do you know that there's a really good movie I just watched two nights ago I want to say it's called the one in some Glenn close and."
510.0,Provider,it's amazing.
12336.0,Patient,Mila kunis. Mila kunis married to you know.
510.0,Provider,yeah I know here.
12336.0,Patient,"Okay yeah um I think it's on netflix and it's about Glenn close is the mother of an addict and it's Neil is the addict and it's crazy whoever wrote it knows what it's like to like live with addiction, because. The shit that Glenn close has to go through, and the dis you see the decisions. she's making in this movie and their decisions you've had to make yourself like you'd have to know you'd have to know you will understand it, because that's what you do."
510.0,Provider,yeah how about. yeah.
12336.0,Patient,I know I was thinking it was going to recommend it to mason I will but not yet because part of the whole thing is the shame that the addict has to deal with that's part of the reason they can't get themselves out. And i've never been into shaming addicts and alcoholics and so many people are. Like when torsten died my family members were talking badly about him was like this dude he's dead like. He didn't want.
510.0,Provider,"To I know the more I mean he was more than that right, yes, the addiction was a big. Part of it and. He was way more than that of course."
12336.0,Patient,"And you know, there was."
510.0,Provider,"enough, and you know that, and I think many know that but you're right there's so much quick to judge."
12336.0,Patient,"lot there's so mean like. First of all, you're insulting me by saying i'd be with some like horrible human being."
510.0,Provider,"wasn't you know, he was more than that."
12336.0,Patient,lived for his sons and they don't know that. Whatever um so yeah. But the one it's a it's good.
510.0,Provider,"yeah i'm going to make a note, I want to make a note of it."
12336.0,Patient,yeah I would watch it first before you told anybody because I don't know like.
510.0,Provider,I have my.
12336.0,Patient,trigger for.
510.0,Provider,"Some people, and I was worried, it might be a trigger for me, but."
12336.0,Patient,It wasn't if anything. I was sort of validate hell for.
510.0,Provider,You yeah.
12336.0,Patient,No.
510.0,Provider,Because bill I think hey I am not the only person on this planet and you are certainly not but sometimes when we want stories or hear those stories it's this implicit validation that we didn't realize is so comforting and that's what you're talking.
12336.0,Patient,"about what was comforting was watching the addict. There so. they're just master manipulators like mason was a master mason I love him to death, but he he can outsmart."
510.0,Provider,Anybody now.
12336.0,Patient,"You it got to the point where I would look at Taurus and be like, why are you even going to go into his room and waste your time looking for drugs. is like so I can take them away and like he'll just get more and you'll never find them I go, are you going to unscrew every electrical outlet because they're in behind the outlets through. The ceiling like you're not going to get them don't waste your time that's that's I could say that because that's the point I had gotten to with him in the alcohol. I would always find it, no matter where it is. Literally I didn't find them all, because after he died, I found another for. You know, but he just had them everywhere, I think."
510.0,Provider,yeah I know it's embedded in secrecy and the drive is the the drug whenever drug.
12336.0,Patient,"I think part of it is getting away with them, I think, part of it for them is getting away with it, they. it's weird it's that's part of their. Their control thing I think for them to know they outsmarted the person who's trying to help them. But in the movie. You see Glenn close struggle to make it there's a really big one, at the end that she struggles to make, and I think I would have made the same decision you have to see it."
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12336.0,Patient,If you can read it on her face like.
510.0,Provider,"about it, I know a phenomenal actress like you really like. Your."

12336.0,Patient,yeah it didn't really love or anything.
510.0,Provider,"Your level of insight Lisa I mean I know you were tearful earlier and your level of insight you're you're you're right where you need to be you're. Getting I understand that. Okay it's still painful though, and as a reminder, the pain is there and you're you're just trying to relate to it you're trying to experience it we just don't want you to get completely over identified right. allow yourself to feel it and know that you don't have to judge it in this moment i'm really sad or i'm really anxious or i'm really frustrated. allow it, and then you can just see how can I attend to myself and then, and then you do, whether it's self care talking yourself with compassion and kindness utilizing your supports you're doing the right things. Okay really want you to know that."
