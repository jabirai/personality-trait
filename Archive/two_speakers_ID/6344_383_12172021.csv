We got a letter, it said she'll have $123 a month added to it, but it was $1,120 so we were like whoa like thank you. To our daughter, and she goes sure. i'd love to help. So those have been very helpful, which we shop at the farmers market and so. You swipe the card and put your pin and they give you tokens at the farmers market. I think, for the. First $15 you take. out they match $15 with tokens. And we can buy. Food all food except you know hot food."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6344.0,Patient,"So that's been helpful, so we use that a lot. But it's kind of embarrassing i'm like do on a Caucasian person in the line you know it's mostly the elderly Asian people and I like stick out like a sore thumb kind of embarrassing that. I have to do it this way, but again I go good you know coven really derailed me, I mean. Everyone has their own. Kobe story, you know. Right so yeah."
383.0,Provider,"You really were very resilient, though. Mark you know and that's a really great quality you jumped in there, and you kept on. You know uncovering opportunities or just making sure you are linked with people, so that any opportunity that surface would be."
6344.0,Patient,"True yeah true and then, when I lost my job immediately I applied for everything and anything. Like the hours that I found out, you know, I was already on the phone with. With everybody, you know you know. yeah so I had to do a lot of footwork."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6344.0,Patient,And then finding right hard dude. I went through so many and finally bright hard came through for me so i'm very thankful.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good and. yeah how are you doing with the groups, and I know that that was you know kind of like you were. frustrated with that and."
6344.0,Patient,"So yeah so. I now work till 530. And so I told my boss, I have group now that I just can't. pop in whenever I want, so I told them, this is an obligation that I need to do. So now, I could every week and then I get a. an email saying my next group was December 16 which was yesterday i'm like okay Why am I Why am I scheduled now, instead of every week."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think we reduced your group frequency to monthly because you were you had requested that you, you weren't too, you know you were busy and. And, and you weren't, you said you weren't getting that much out of groups, so we reduce the frequency to monthly and then what they do is they schedule that monthly if you're bi weekly, then it will be on a schedule. And if your monthly it will also be on a schedule as well."
6344.0,Patient,"I mean, I think I could do every other week."
383.0,Provider,"Do you want to be in the group every other week, do you feel like you know you would get. something out of it."
6344.0,Patient,"What I like about it is. it's kind of like the same people in our group, and then we'll have a new one here in there, but then, some would fall off and i'm like where where's that person. But I don't. The meditation and stretching and all that I i'm too tired to do it. You know, so I don't to myself, I just don't speak in that."
383.0,Provider,yeah i've noticed that I didn't know if it was if you just. weren't connecting with it or.
6344.0,Patient,"Is it just something i've never done in my whole life. Never, the only stretching I do is in the morning."
383.0,Provider,you've never done like a mindfulness type of thing.
6344.0,Patient,"All right, no. No. Only listening to sounds major. waves crashing."
383.0,Provider,Right.
6344.0,Patient,that's what I I like to do.
383.0,Provider,I see.
6344.0,Patient,eye to eye on wind.
383.0,Provider,"uh huh. yeah well, maybe one day i've been of bringing nature sounds that's a great idea."
6344.0,Patient,"That would be really awesome. yeah just like all the. Pictures you share those are like awesome you're sharing your private life so that's fun to see intel's wedding pictures and now she's so excited to be a grandmother, those are. Those are fun things."
383.0,Provider,are like yeah yeah.
6344.0,Patient,And i'm sure the group does too.
383.0,Provider,yeah welcome mindfulness can take different shapes and I do come from more of a body centered kind of approach but i'll bring i'll maybe i'll bring in some nature sounds that sounds great as a background.
6344.0,Patient,Right.
383.0,Provider,"yeah I mean the point of it is, is to connect with the present to you know and many times as a stress reaction people become very disconnected from themselves in the present moment and. In different or detached from their own bodily you know felt experience, as they say so that's part of why you know when we get too detached from ourself. It can, it can be unhealthy because we don't really know what we're feeling or think you know what we're feeling and so doing these activities that help just turn our attention back toward ourself. can be helpful for some people."
6344.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"And I I really appreciate it, how supportive you were of one of our the group member who's going through so many health problems, last night, that was really great."
6344.0,Patient,"yeah I just. You know you take, we. Take a lot of things for granted, you know and. I would be under the covers if I hadn't been going through all of that, but she's fighting the way."
383.0,Provider,"I know. yeah. yeah um so. If you came to group twice per month, then you do get that contact with chantel also twice per month, if you need any you know just quick action with her and so forth."
6344.0,Patient,I know.
383.0,Provider,"Okay now do you want to drop your end because you weren't meeting the individual therapy frequency appointments of twice per month, but maybe we can change that to once per month, the individual and bring you to group twice per month How does that."
6344.0,Patient,"Yes, alright sounds good."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
6344.0,Patient,"And they're still not giving. Those friendly reminders hey that. Your group with amanda or you know change our group. Really yeah those things will be a few times is that's how I.
