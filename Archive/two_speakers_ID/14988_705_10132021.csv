14988.0,Patient,I didn't have a question I was just giggling.
705.0,Provider,"Okay sorry it cut out there for a moment, so just making sure that no question, there on I know you probably filled out an intake forms that talked about confidentiality and Privacy Act and all that. Just wanting to show you lauren that broken heart i'm going to call it the hh at bright heart health we do take that. of importance, and so, if someone calls tomorrow, and they want to know lauren if you and I met today and what was the outcome of having the assessment, I can't confirm or deny that I even know you without first asking you to consent to that party outside of right heartfelt."
14988.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely the exceptions to the confidentiality, though. Is and you probably have heard this before we're mandated reporters if it comes to elder abuse or child abuse outside of that if you share that you're going to hurt somebody. Like if you say i'm going to kill and you give us a name we're going to get them help get you help and then also if you share that you want to harm yourself we're going to get you to the help that you need and support you."
14988.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,Have you had before what's called a bio psychosocial assessment.
14988.0,Patient,I don't think so.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, the difference in an assessment versus a counseling session is in counseling we would explore things we would talk a little bit more about like coping skills and things like that. Here today it's more trying to gain a little bit I getting to know you better lauren gaining some past history information family history and then currently what's going on, or we know how to help you best. anytime cuz sometimes I tend to talk really fast, and I have a Texas accent, at times, you might hear just I felt like what did you just say, and let me know that you need clarification on that. Some of the question you are sensitive in nature, and this is a non judgment zone safe zone and just answered the best to your ability."
14988.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"The first question, I like to start off with and you're going to see me look to the left or the right, those are my guidelines or you might even see it in my glasses. The first question, I like to ask is reason why you joined by heart health."
14988.0,Patient,"um i've had addiction issues. Over the past and. Well yeah I have 34 days clean today and. Just kind of been having like memories coming back and things like that so i'm personally uncertain, sometimes of my past and what's real today versus what the past was or wasn't sure I don't know they've been under the influence for so long."
705.0,Provider,i'm glad you're here and did you see 34 days just writing.
14988.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,that's huge.
14988.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,yeah wow wow. As you probably already know it's usually the first day is the hardest and then you just keep accumulating days as you go along.
14988.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,what's been keeping you sober.
14988.0,Patient,"I feel like i've just been. so out of touch with reality and with family like All I want is family. hi I miss like I just. feel like I missed out on a lot of time. And my whole perception of things, has been completely skewed my understanding of things as well. And yeah just wanting to be like everybody else in the regard of just. Just being able to like function and. I don't know just be happy, you know, and I think that honestly starts with like sobriety and being pure you know inside out."
705.0,Provider,Absolutely on like you were sharing to lauren is just getting back to call us sometimes getting out of the fog we're now that you're getting sober you know think the fox lifting a little bit you're starting to discover yourself again.
14988.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,And it sounds like you have a family that's supportive.
14988.0,Patient,"Yes, I have a very awesome family um it's just been like I said really difficult I don't know why, but I don't feel like they're my family, because I feel so different from them. um. And I can't like I said I can't tell if that's just because of drugs or what but i've just felt really. Really, out of place."
705.0,Provider,Do you have brothers and sisters.
14988.0,Patient,I have one brother and one sister.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, are you close with either one of your brother or your sister."
14988.0,Patient,Close with my brother.
705.0,Provider,"As you. As you know, we all have our different personalities and you know I have an older sister and a younger sister and all three of us are so different. yeah yeah. With your mom and your dad they've been your your main caretakers through childhood, you know, like from the start. And until I graduated."
14988.0,Patient,"I yeah yeah. I lost my mom when I was four for us poor my dad remarried when I was seven. And my mom passed away. Five years ago, just about from cancer."
705.0,Provider,"i'm sorry, and you know it's a the loss is still to me recent when you lose a parent, and you know something like that is going through and. Especially if you're actively using as a lot of times when you become sober it's like a lot of this stuff might may be coming up, because you never were given the opportunity. To go grief."
14988.0,Patient,"physically, I think, because I wasn't sober i'm overwhelmed like even just saying it makes me makes me choke back. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"I substances, the big thing is that, at the time is used as a surviving mechanism to get by with what you don't want to think about. But it takes that filling and numbs you were even though it's a struggle today and talking about it lauren is that you are starting to fill the fillings and these things is being able, just to take each day that you know what i'm human these things are coming back and. The feeling of sadness, sometimes those great losses it's like okay working on, you know just for today. I don't know if you have even like a special memory of you know your mom and things like that."
14988.0,Patient,yeah. She was also my kindergarten teachers so yeah I do um. She. She took me out to it was like the last day of kit wow nervously I think it was about the last day kindergarten and stick me out to the mall and bought me like a nail file and took me to lunch and. i'll be at the time I didn't have a mom so she really like role model that feeling of having won the super special like looking back and just that girl time and was awesome.
705.0,Provider,"How that's that's great that you have that memory and that's very sweet where it's like Oh, I remember that. Do you know with your family history if there was any type of like substance use disorder in your history of our mental health disorders."
14988.0,Patient,A I know that my mom had issues with alcohol my brother has issues with alcohol um. yeah and my sisters had addiction issues as well to substance.
705.0,Provider,And currently what city and State do you live in.
14988.0,Patient,modesto California.
705.0,Provider,And do you live alone or with others.
14988.0,Patient,i'm staying with my brother.
705.0,Provider,Thank you any type of military service.
14988.0,Patient,No okay.
705.0,Provider,"And thank you to i'm pulling from the questionnaire that you filled out that look like to some of the legal was arrested before 18 running away and truancy anything else with like duis or anything like that, throughout your lifetime."
14988.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I got a dui when I was. yeah I had had like a year and some change, clean and my grandfather passed away and it just like death is seems to be a massive trigger for me, I have a huge issue with a band Amir and loss and I. always feel like i'm on the outside looking in I never really feel a part of and that's not really ever the case because i'm surrounded by people but. I don't feel a part of, and then, at the same time, I could get surrounded by people like if i'm out and about somewhere new a group. forms around me I all of a sudden, develop a sense of anxiety and feel like everybody's staring at me and talking about me and i'm and I don't know where that comes from either."
705.0,Provider,"Right now, to learn, with some of it is rolling out if it's residual effect from coming off of the substance and a lot of that can create some anxiety, or is it that anxiety has been there. The whole time and part of your substance use was. initiated to help you enjoy it."
14988.0,Patient,"yeah. i've had a lot of recent discovery of trauma like staying like the reason why was because I felt like something was happening in this House, and I have gone to. them or emergency room to confirm whether like full salt or anything was happening, they did I know it's like a sexual assault like encounter or trauma there and. yeah I definitely like i've been covering. You know, for very long time and very inappropriate relationship with a coach in high school, who is is old old enough to be my man oh. yeah. yeah. And like after that."
705.0,Provider,"It seems lauren can you hear me, I think it the Internet for you froze for a moment. let's see if. It should ask you for your camera again and we'll see if. We can get your audio back. Oh, I can hear you yes that's great I can hear you. There you go, thank you, it looks like it just froze on your end for a minute. I did hear you talking about the last of it lauren was there was an inappropriate. relationship with the coach in high school."
14988.0,Patient,"and Basically, after that happened, like everything in my life just felt a shit excuse my language, everything just went horrible it was never the same it just. Everything was just off the charts I quit talking to friends tied this relationship by there's just so many things that I did to just avoid. Talking. You know. Maybe come like very familiar to that lonely miserable feeling of existence, so I don't know I think I just started partying and drinking and doing all kinds of things at that point."
705.0,Provider,"And when you're that young and you. are trusting someone, and they have used that trust and things like that you can't process with being so young, and so it usually is where you turn to other things such as substances. Because you can process that while you were so young."
14988.0,Patient,"yeah and like I don't know why, but I always have this eerie feeling like i'm the bad guy like I did something wrong i'm i'm a terrible person, and all this and I don't know where that even comes from either it's it's. it's all."
705.0,Provider,You froze for one minute lauren.
14988.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah it just froze for one moment I wanted to see to so you were talking about that you know, for you is not being. able to. Basically, communicate with with others and share. what's happening and with with traumas a lot of times anxiety does develop."
14988.0,Patient,"yeah and like I said it's it's being on both ends like thought like i'm the bad person and. But i'm the victim I don't know how that works out to be. it's the most screwy feeling i've ever had a messes with my head on a regular basis, even just with just a coping in the world feeling like devil versus angel versus. You know."
705.0,Provider,"It can be absolutely and with lauren is i'm glad that you're able to talk about it and to start to put out there, you know you said some really important things which is. You know, part of that too is being in a room that's maybe full of people, but yet you still feel alone and it's like things like that will help you as you're in your recovery to start to see like okay. here's an area, maybe I want to take a look at and definitely one of that is the the trauma and being able to process that start to address it a little bit more."
14988.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"With it, then, will be some more of your self discoveries and being able to build that that sober support, as you move up, you know as you go through this. Right mm hmm."
14988.0,Patient,"Like even going to charge and stuff I, I get the best feeling when i'm there like it's it's unreal like how at home, I feel, and how good I feel. And then I leave there and I get this empty feeling like i'm just like my own worst enemy and then I want to go. necessarily old places like drugs and those kinds of people not like that that's like the furthest thing from my thought process. it's like I just want to go back to comfortable things like the dead end job the the you know what I mean stuff like that stuff that requires very little to no effort come super easy. I love predictability it's sickening how I can watch the same things over and over and over again, because I know what's going to happen and it's. it's sad that I live like that it's super sad but I don't know how to like kind of break the cycle and i'm really I really am trying like putting on Mary poppins last night, instead of watching cruella for like the third time. I decided to do something else but it's it's just that predictability piece, even down to eating sometimes like. Until I came to my brothers, I was literally very rehearsed on the way I ate where I went how I went everything everything, because that was the only thing I could trust, because I knew this from that you know, like the back of my hand. And i'm trying to really be. honest and free with with whatever's coming my way but it's scaring me a lot it scares me and it terrifies me that I can't just let go. Because I feel like you're somebody or something just around the corner. That it's just me so that I get confused like whoa by the bad person by the person I freaking out over. It makes those sets."
705.0,Provider,"lauren as you're describing it could be even trauma responses and sometimes how we respond in different ways, and so, when you're. Sharing you know this is absolutely. A start of where you can start to understand it more and start to heal from. It and it makes sense to me of why you'd want that stability, where you said, the predictability. Is when you were younger and to have a traumatic event happen is he lost the trust you didn't have the stability there, and that was your early like. experiences and so, in your adult life you're still carrying some of the childhood imprints that you carried with you and that's where it's like okay. you're noticing which you're going to even notice more things just like you changed it up with the TV where you're like I know I always watch this and the predictability part that gives me comfort. i'm going to try to go and adjustments and small steps, just the small steps and be able to to. Yes, goals are great but also make it more manageable pull it back if it gets too overwhelming."
14988.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"it's like just for today celebrate your wins. This is new, for you, you haven't done this before you're here today. check that off as a man it's like heck out so that predictability piece you didn't know you know how this was going to be, that is, may be considered a small step, but I think it's a huge step."
14988.0,Patient,"And no it's okay. I wanted to not come to this, I wanted to find an excuse to not arrived. I was really searching her wide like well, maybe God will heal this too."
705.0,Provider,boring or not.
14988.0,Patient,"will restore me but. I don't think I know I believe he works through people you know, and I would imagine he's going to work through you to help me."
705.0,Provider,"you're not alone either i've heard that many times, where they're like. I tried to think myself into being sick I tried to you know do X, Y and Z. And then they came in. So. Okay, good for you and you know again some of the stuff I know is causing where things start to surface and it's okay to just like take a deep breath and just put yourself back to the day that today i'm getting the help that I need. There is. No timeline where a lot of these things collectively has happened throughout the years right. We become who we are, today, because of some of our experiences and how we view ourselves how I call them core beliefs. Especially with trauma how we view ourselves how we view others how we even view the world, and so, if you don't have security when you're younger, you can get a global video that the world is dangerous. It can just go from there."
14988.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"bring it back and just be like you know what for today I am breaking the cycle, I am here I am doing something different. And the sobriety piece. If you can get that one you already have with 34 days."
14988.0,Patient,"Beautiful yeah. it's weird because, like I said it's not even like the wanting to go back out and use the only thing I will say, is, I feel like i'm still cheating on the clean thing because I have to take that suboxone stuff. And I hate that like I hate that I have to take that like I feel like i'm totally cheating."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I disagree with you."
14988.0,Patient,"Okay, like I don't even take the full recommended dose."
705.0,Provider,"here's what i'm going to say lauren is that. substance use disorder is no different than any other type of mental health disorder. Okay right. And so, mental health disorder, if someone needed to take their medication where they weren't as depressed. Is that OK, if someone is so depressed they can't get out of bed, so they take their medication to get out of bed and we're talking daily activities, sometimes suffered not brushing your teeth not showering."
14988.0,Patient,"yeah you're right I can't disagree with it, I can't disagree with that I kept thinking like okay again God will heal this one, too, but I feel like when I went off of it for like three days I was unraveling."
705.0,Provider,"Right it's giving yourself a chance that sometimes medication is just for a period of time, it can be brief and sometimes we need medication to help us like with anger management. If someone is so angry all the time they're not going to manage their anger. They don't have that ability, but give them some medicine that will help calm for at least two seconds that maybe they can excuse themselves. it's something to build on and the same thing with you know substance use disorder it's a disorder and it we know it can be treated effectively with medication. Will you need medication, the rest of your life, maybe not, but this is to help you we're bringing it down a level where the cravings are so crazy where you're like I you know when you're out the door where you're able to manage better."
14988.0,Patient,"Okay, so. i've been incredibly honest I get so worried that like. i'll get hooked on it that's what i'm afraid of like that's why I got myself down to the one strip a day. But I do still feel like a little edgy at times. Like yesterday, when I was taking my walk it's like I don't know any other way around it and i'm trying to find all these tools to deal, instead of just taking something taking something taking something. And it was a very hard thing yesterday and I don't know if this is just common what i'm going through or if it's because i'm not taking my full recommended dose I don't know, but I just feel like sometimes. It takes it requires quite a bit of effort. Like almost an over like I like I will walk and walk and walk. and walk and walk and walk like one that I walked for like an hour and a half, maybe flat, you know, and I don't think that's necessarily good either because I can't pace and i'm normally a pacer."
705.0,Provider,"rate, and so the medication is helping you with some of those symptoms, and so it can assist you with bringing it down. talk to your prescriber about it and just be honest lauren that you know look I don't want to be hooked on this here's how i've been doing it here's where i'm trying to find balance. see what they're going to recommend and it's good if you're mindful about it that's good I always say if you're mindful then it's like you're educating yourself you're talking about it now. yeah that's fine but substance use disorder is just like other disorders, a lot of times with. Diabetes if if someone is diabetic they take medication to help lower. It and in time. Sometimes, if they're managing it that they no longer maybe have to take the medication were others have to take a dose to manage it."
14988.0,Patient,"yeah. Like and the suboxone to is not like it's the. clonidine that one really helps um. It really helps and I feel guilty saying that like I can ride on the one strip of suboxone feel just fine today was a great day, took the clonidine today, it was a great day. Like I said there's guilt around that I have massive guilt like i'm not doing this, the real way i'm cheating um and because I feel so good. Like there's something wrong with that."
705.0,Provider,"Again, these are all good things lauren that the more that you're in this process is starting to explore more of having that tendency to. Take it where it's in a way, like it's not you're setting the bar up to fell like you're like this never meets my standard up here because I expect so much about myself. That I can internalize the negative feelings that keep me going into the guilt and so, you know as you go through this you can start to work on some of that what's healthy shame versus unhealthy shame, you know and there's a lot like. I can't encourage you enough lauren you're doing great today to just keep being honest don't hold back don't edit."
14988.0,Patient,"Okay, good cuz you're in that makes me feel guilty it's the most screwy feeling like when you've been so dishonest and that's the most comfortable way of being being honest."
705.0,Provider,"Remember, though, especially with substance use it's not a disorder, where you can say hey I need like if someone maybe. Has diabetes and they overeat and they have a diabetic coma People may say Oh, I hope, they're okay things like that. Well, was with substance use disorder it's not it's more of an internal usually and it's not like you can see it or people don't identify with it as much. And so, when you talk about a relapse or you talk about you know other things people may not understand and then that also plays a part of where you know with a substance use you start doubting yourself, or you start to feel like how come I don't measure up."
14988.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
705.0,Provider,Well guess what those things are changing.
14988.0,Patient,"Okay, good cuz like I said, even feeling good I feel so stupid about like and I don't want to feel like that I want to feel good about feeling good I don't want to feel silly about it, or like. yeah I don't want to i'm so tired of feeling guilt and shame i'm so over it like so over at like it has ruled so much of my addiction my existence all of it yeah."
705.0,Provider,it's not going to happen overnight I wish I could tell you. it's going to be a quick fix it's not like.
14988.0,Patient,You would be a big gillion it.
705.0,Provider,"Just like it took many years to develop where you are right now, and some of that internal dialogue it's going to take time, but it does happen, is where you start to learn different coping strategies to counteract those thoughts. So just like that guilt in that shame behind you. Having a substance use disorder is hopefully you can start to share that no I don't deserve to feel this way I have a disorder, just like other disorders, we know it's treatable we know it's manageable right."
14988.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"it's like other diseases, if you don't treat it, we also know, it can be deadly it progressively gets worse, those are things that make it a disease, like other diseases so let's treat it like a disease. And that starts with you not feeling guilty about her disease, where it's like no I did some things that maybe i'm not happy about when I was under the influence and those maybe if people want to put it in the bad category, but you're not bad."
14988.0,Patient,yeah I think I have a lot to do it step one and accepting i'm an addict and it's a disease for sure i'm powerless over it to being a disease.
705.0,Provider,"The more that you're willing to really pick That apart, and I like how already you're like here i'm looking at it this way and that way. that's perfect that's where you start to learn how does it apply to me because the more that you believe it, the more you're going to carry it through and it's just like we're all different different people are in different stages of their recovery there's different types of recovery. Okay, when you're in group, you can pick and choose some sometimes people may say something that works for them, you try it it doesn't work for you roll it out it's like one less thing. may hear something to that you start to say you know what I relate to that. You try it out and it just might be like okay. So, again coping strategies, you will learn so many different ones, and some of them work on different days for different situations."
14988.0,Patient,Okay. Good.
705.0,Provider,"cognitive behavior therapy it works, and especially with substance use disorder. And it's just being able to and people will say well you're trying to make everything positive no we're not trying to make everything positive it's just more realistic and more like Okay, I can take a look at, I made a mistake versus I am a mistake."
14988.0,Patient,Oh yeah I like that I like that. yeah that's something i'm definitely trying to grasp is that one is understanding mistake is not something I need to keep looking back on but like not to repeat it again. Moving forward.
705.0,Provider,yeah and our life experiences of when we make a mistake or opportunities to learn and grow from.
14988.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and then with that, then it will you know we change our thoughts about something, then we change our feelings we change our feelings we change our behavior right. we change our food like It all starts to connect it away. So, again, I am glad that you are here and that you're starting you know to process and you probably already have started groups."
14988.0,Patient,"yeah I. i've been to two out of like I think four or yeah two out of four and. Group was really crummy on Friday i'm not sure if it's by choice that it went that way, or if it was literally this situation again feeling kind of weird about things, and the medication and feeling like because i've got on my side like i'm this powerful being or something like that. and I was asked to like obviously get out of my car, because I was in the backseat my brother was driving and you know there's privacy and whatnot and then that's not even what bothered me, it was the fact that. There were rules that they weren't applicable to everybody and people had to leave early and it was like obviously I was out shopping too, and I was also in the midst of things, but then it was pointed out that I hadn't been to the last group or the group before and i'd missed. So I guess i'm just super black and white individual to me rules are rules either we're all staying a support group but we're not. But what and I get like one person here and there, you know, but when there was like four or five it was like wait a minute so half of us can leave by choice, but the other half of US can't and again didn't read it anywhere, where it stated either or. Again, I am not the boss, but, for whatever reason, I want to be the controller, and things and bossy and I feel like if a rule is the rule, then it should apply to everybody period, especially if it applies to me. And then. Checking in with Dr Lund, I had questions and was just kind of more or less like I don't want to be on this stuff forever he recommends me being on it for a year. So I have a better success rate i'm so untrusting with people right now, I wonder, you know, like was this guy like gonna just tell me a year and then i'm going to be hooked on it so, then the success rate shows yeah i've stayed cleaning your. i've been on the box and crap for a year and then it then there goes two years and then three years and, of course, it's a successful rate. You know i'm thinking of stats to in my brain i'm not a dumb girl, by any means I don't think, and so I was looking at it from that angle and I felt like he was humoring me but not really answering me."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I will say this morn is give the group, you know give give it time because some of it like I facilitate different groups and group dynamics can change, I will sometimes have. A lot of people that have been there for a bit they may leave. Everybody is kind of new so a lot of it is just getting to know the people that are in your group, they can getting to know you you getting to know the facilitators. And you're right with the guidelines we do have our guidelines and to see. Which one of them, you know which guidelines is your group, where it's like mainly this is how our group runs and it may be different, you know if you switch to at a time something else, where it's maybe a little bit like Okay, is the guideline hat does it have some flexibility. yeah yeah and I hear what you're saying is just if i'm going to be there in the group I would want everybody to be there in a group."
14988.0,Patient,"Well yeah that was there, their whole point to me was we're here to support each other, you need to stay for the hour or if i'm going to be here to support all of you, then, where the hell, are you all going. that's where I was at with it. yeah and and again and again i'm not i'm not anyone's boss, but I do need support and then I completely got passive aggressive. And didn't say anything at all, I just shut down and didn't participate in the group I just nodded I might have thumbs up maybe once or twice. And they call them me once or twice and I just had nothing to say because also everybody jumped in on my check in which. pissed me off because are ticked me off, because everyone else's check ins were. them in the doctor and I didn't like that it's like again if we're going to have a set of rules or a way of doing things we need to be respectful in all facets all areas in my eyes, because that's the way that's how i'm expected to be in group, I would hope it goes always. But again i'm not the boss so who am I to be. But I feel like i'm the boss."
705.0,Provider,"You know lauren you still have your sense of humor and it's like Yes, some of it."
14988.0,Patient,Is.
705.0,Provider,"That we can take a look at ourselves and sometimes say look. Can I have some flexibility and, if so, is it for this group is that appropriate or or not, and to be able, just to see you know where you go with it, that was some of your new experiences. You know, and just. When you feel more comfortable share how you were feeling. You know. If this is continues and you're just filling away. Being able to. share that in a safe zone."
14988.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"yeah. Absolutely, that I have to lick your other history with substance use. And then, it looks like to I know you said that you identify as single and you have one son."
14988.0,Patient,"Yes. Is 14 identify myself a single a my guy can enable this but I read your memory issues, I feel like I have a whole other family out there. I feel like i've maybe even been married before, but I have no proof of this at all at all. at all, but it's just an intuition, I have very weird. Okay, and I don't, and again I get nervous to say these things out because I don't want somebody but little she's crazy, you know. But, but for now, today, I have one son and i'm single."
705.0,Provider,"Now. again. lauren it's like nothing is is surprising because, especially if you're doing substances is trying to see what's reality and what is not, and sometimes recalling the past is difficult and so you're hiding now that you're sober. To try to play some of this and it can feel like you said kind of odd an off. yep yeah. again remind yourself each day that you know what this is this is new to me, I am embarking on this, you know it's all about exploring they can some self discoveries. And just pulling it back into today just for the day i'm sober. And then, a day keep adding keep adding. I wanted to go over to what we call it our safety protocol, and this one's the Columbia risk and protective factors and this one, the questions are specifically in regards to suicide and so. We want to make sure of how that we can help you if you feel suicidal in the past, or at any times, so the first question on here is, have you wish that you were dead or wish that you could go to sleep and not wake up in your lifetime."
14988.0,Patient,Oh i've had that feeling before yes.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, can you tell me, the last time that you felt that way."
14988.0,Patient,"So I guess today, when I was like tell me about when I came back from the doctor and I went on a walk and it was a fleeting thought and it wasn't like going to sleep and waking up, it was just like if somebody had pushed me over the ledge that we're just been fine with me at that moment. Okay again again the feeling i'm like I can't put drugs in this bad feeling I don't know what to do with this bad feeling. And, as I kept walking and walking it it subsided like I knew that's not what I wanted to do psychologically I recognized as a fleeting thought and kept talking and talking out loud and self talking and talking and talking out loud I finally reached a point where. you're not going to use this bad feeling as an excuse to be stupid or loaded or whatever, but maybe one day it'll it'll be something I can share with somebody else and get them through something else. going to be a strength builder but as of yesterday, I felt terrible you know just felt terrible."
705.0,Provider,"However, I would point out lauren that you made it through and just like you said it was a fleeting thought you identified what was going on, and then you did what we call you know, using a determined by i'm not always going to feel this way. i'm not going to you know think this any further i'm going to go about my day. You know, with this to how many times like a week, do you feel or with the thoughts alone is it usually like daily couple of times a week couple of times a month."
14988.0,Patient,"Right I right now it's the least it's been all month so right now, I would say, probably once a day, maybe twice I have it, and it happens generally in the morning and in the evening. And again it's like I have to go on a walk. and deter from it the other thing is is gonna sound wild I missed my animals like crazy because they really help ease a lot of my anxiety, a lot of it, whether I can walk them and feel not alone in my walk or pet the heck out of them, just so I have some movement. yeah and I had to give those up in my movie and stuff that's been really tough, as you know, i'm really dealing with being by myself, you know and it's tough and I do recognize like what you said about making it through like today, I was in a great mood. Still woke up you know kind of feeling crummy a little bit, but prayed got moving got my son school music always seems to help me a lot helps me change my mood and i'm trying to really be vigilant of it's a choice. it's a choice my mood can be a choice, but sometimes you know the feelings are just overwhelming and like I don't know why I wake up feeling so crappy like I hate that I wake up every morning feeling like I could cry and I sometimes do cry okay."
705.0,Provider,"Do you ever go from then where you said, sometimes you have the fleeting thoughts does that ever lead and two thoughts about how you would do it."
14988.0,Patient,"No yeah. Oh God no it's like a quick it's literally fleeting like like I said, and it would be like accidental like it would just be I guess if a car hit me. I wouldn't be doing this."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
14988.0,Patient,"That kind of thing you know what I mean I wouldn't stop it, but it wouldn't it's never been an actual vision of me. Like planning anything or anything like that, no, no. Like if an accident happen. You know kind of a thing."
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah, and this will just basically duplicate the same question is to never collected pills obtained a gun giveaway valuables are wrote a suicide note or two pills, in order for you to to harm yourself."
14988.0,Patient,"No, not that I think I know when I was in high school I threatened my parents with a bottle of tylenol but never take anything I used to have. issues with cutting myself. history of cutting."
705.0,Provider,"When was the last time that you remember, cutting yourself."
14988.0,Patient,hi about two or three years ago. Okay.
705.0,Provider,"Do you have now where you reside, do you have access to like a gun or weapons like that."
14988.0,Patient,"No gun I have access to knives all the time, but again I don't look at them like that at all I. I think. I think that's where a lot of this discomfort comes from is knowing like that doesn't work and not knowing what else not having other tools right now."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, do you feel like you know we looked at, we look at protective factors, and so do you feel a protective factor is that you feel a sense of responsibility to continue living for your family and friends."
14988.0,Patient,"No, I feel a sense of responsibility to me actually enter the integration into my son, but. Like sobriety for me this time is, for me, and like before it was for my kiddo and I think that's why it wasn't successful, and again I really firmly believe that's why a lot of this is so highly uncomfortable. Because i'm dealing with me it's not about losing my kidding core it's not about getting a dui and getting yourself into legal trouble it's literally about like a life and death, and I don't want to die, I want to live, and I want to figure out how to do that and I don't know. The struggle for me it's not knowing how, how does everybody else do it what's the rest of secret recipe like what's the magic ingredient, how come everybody got the memo and I feel like i'm 20 steps."
705.0,Provider,"Pulling yourself back in today, you know what lauren today you're doing this and that you're not going to be figuring it all out right now. that a lot of this will, in time, you know we'll we'll have more clarity, but you are very self aware, you have really good self, awareness and building on that. To where quieting down the part that goes more towards negative more that inner dialogue to the self awareness that prompts you to say you know what i'm going to dispute this i'm going to challenge this thought, because no longer am I going to believe this. Exact were. shifted over right. And you'll learn that. it's absolutely very doable, and this is where you know, have you felt like in the. last three months any sense of hopelessness or helplessness."
14988.0,Patient,"Oh yeah three months ago, absolutely and then gosh like three months ago, I was journaling that. I felt life would be better, without me unit like kind of like how you were saying, like the sense of obligation to family, it was kind of the opposite like I would be doing everybody a favor if I just let the tide take me away. I could feel my addiction just becoming. so out of my tears like I thought, if I could do this functioning addict like I was going to have it be like successful you know. And I could feel I was losing it absolute control of everything everything I had no relationship anymore I just. went to work and that only provide for my habit, I was being the most awful mother to my kiddo um you know yeah I was there and taking care of like the real basics, but I wasn't there you know what I mean."
705.0,Provider,"No, that makes sense."
14988.0,Patient,"When I could feel like all the walls just coming in and then. And then, like I just started like my room and put out this notebook and I just started journaling it, saying that cow I just didn't want to be around anymore, and I just thought it would be better. And I know, since that original entry till now. it's Definitely not. I still have moments of hopelessness, where I just wonder like Am I ever going to get the tools, I need to overcome this feeling that's My fear is that I want something so badly that i'll miss marker."
705.0,Provider,"and drawing back on learn that. Even with the suicidal thoughts that you. notice that they were fleeting and you notice that if you go for a walk you can distract yourself and you've done that, time and time again. And so, how you felt even under the influence, even the self talk of what you said there, along the lines of harming yourself have changed now because you're not using. i'm so you know with that too, sometimes there's also a belief that suicide is immoral, or because of spirituality that you wouldn't follow through with it is there anything like that for you, when it comes to suicide."
14988.0,Patient,"I don't feel like I actually feel like I say I feel very safe, I just have the fear that i'm going to miss the marker like I said, like there's this answer that everybody's got and i'm not going to get it. And then i'll die from that I will die because I didn't pick up, but it was being thrown down part of that guilt, the shame of where I was at it my house and missing the marker and things were happening, I did see it because I was so blown. Over i'm afraid, I know that i've got new lenses and everyone else has had their lenses forever that i'm not going to see the same things are seed and i'll miss it again."
705.0,Provider,"And what you see lauren will be different than other people you're. Right it's going to be different because we've had experiences that are different from when we were young all the way until our adulthood. Your coping skills may be very different than someone else it's being in long term recovery is going to look different if I took a role of thousands and thousands millions and millions now of people in long term recovery. You would see different stories, you would see different things, and so you're right it's not going to be like what worked for you and was just like the Aha moment might be different for somebody else. And it might be, at the same pace. And so, when you feel like that you start going into that you know being that self critic and starting to judge and your progress is pull yourself back just for today i'm doing my best. And that's what we're going to keep going over is just for today i'm doing my best. I deserve to feel good just for today i'm doing my best. And what i'd like to do is we call it the safety plan and then i'll email it to you it's it's just something you can reflect on because let's say you're having a day, where you've already. The fleeting thoughts, maybe you're starting to have a little bit more that you want to do some self harm. And for you to be able to get out your safety plan and go Okay, this is what I need to do instead rather it's walking and we're going to come up with that right now it's a good guideline to have. there's some numbers to i'll give you that are some good resources. Okay, so when we talk about warning signs, can you give me three warning signs that can be thought images mood situation or behavior that in crisis may be developing."
14988.0,Patient,"And samples, let me know. I do I need example i'm so sorry i'm like super unfamiliar I feel like I only have sad and mad and happy as my feelings like nothing no others in between and oh and frustration."
705.0,Provider,yeah when you're feeling. Good feeling frustrated.
14988.0,Patient,"Confusion confusions a big one for me i'm very confused and then I have distrust for everyone and everything around me and then I start wondering like if people are toying with my head if i'm again missing the marker and. And then I start shaming myself for feeling that way. I, like you, shouldn't be feeling that way shame on you shame on you and because you feel that way if this car came and hits you like that would probably be again, the best thing that ever happened again that quick thought like. And that's where I feel terrible even saying that."
705.0,Provider,"The more that you say it and verbalize those things lauren, the more you take power out of it it's when you keep these things quiet that it grows and grows and so. that's why we do the safety plan is for you me, really good information so when you're feeling frustrated or missing the mark or. shaming yourself, you feel distrustful were confused and so those are going to be, you know some of yours, sometimes i'm warning sign too is if you're having maybe a day that you're crying more than usual, or you feel like you don't want to get out of bed anything like that for you."
14988.0,Patient,"um. Sometimes, I do have the feeling like I don't want to get out of bed almost every day, but I still get up and get out of bed and handle business, and I do feel better for it, I make my list of 10 things and. I feel very good when I can check them off individually, because I can see like you've made progress from. The original 10 being actual things to do to now you've actually completed six or seven of them and that feels good to me. And just not feeling like I have a lot to fill my time, right now, and every you know I know I feel like everybody's waiting on me to do something and I don't know what the hell, that is, like it again is that in my head or is that a real thing I don't know. Like my biggest most important job right now to get right with myself and I don't know why I just keep thinking like you got to get it you got to get it soon, and if you don't get it soon like something terrible will happen and and that's what goes on in my head. More like your family's gonna. Like I have this image, like my family is just going to load up on a boat and leave me on the dock and they're just going to take off without me because I. I don't know I didn't I didn't get it in enough time and I don't know why I have this time thing in my head and there's no actual. limit like it's not like it's two months or five months it's like in my head, though it just feels like I don't have lots of time. And I don't know where it comes from that freaks me out."
705.0,Provider,"Can you tell me, too, I know, when we talk now three coping strategies and you talk about like things I can do to take my mind off the problems without contacting a person, it can be relaxation techniques physical activity and you did name already walking."
14988.0,Patient,I do walking i've been doing yoga.
705.0,Provider,Oh good.
14988.0,Patient,"And then i've been doing meditating and they seem to really help. them like little things happen like like my laptop went down, and it was like I was yesterday such a bad mood I wanted to just take that thing it's smashed the shit out of it because I was so bad like how come i'm trying to do so, such a positive thing, and the one reinforcer I. Do not working, like all I wanted to do is meditate and the thing with my phone it's weird with my phone I don't want to be attached to my phone all the time actually want to be able to set my phone down. and get in front of my laptop and be separated from it and I can't. Because I feel like everything comes back to this damn phone, I have to do everything for vote no offense I have to talk to you on the phone instead of i'd rather put my phone down and actually have my laptop just sitting in front of me and be more relaxed and arms down and."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14988.0,Patient,I know that sounds crazy of being super picky I guess I don't know.
705.0,Provider,"I don't think so at all I think lauren that a lot of people right now are preferring in person, but this is right now like, maybe what's available and easy you know easier to get connected. And this is, if you start, and if you ever feel like. Okay now i'm building a foundation, and I want to do some other things in person, then we can always talk about that, and what that would be like, and that may be, we know as you go through the stages of change, you might desire that to go in person."
14988.0,Patient,"ya know, and this is a great start a brilliant. Absolutely I just don't know why, like it's so weirded out by the phone. Except for me, I like doing the emails from the phone the videos from the bone everything from the bone the bone the bone the bone the bone and I I don't know what I don't know why i'm just. So weirded out by the third I can't have my laptop."
705.0,Provider,I.
14988.0,Patient,"began to because I was able to watch my movies on there, and little things like that they're just little things I could do on there that just helped bring me relief."
705.0,Provider,Can you get me then three social settings that would be coping strategies and so those are people are social settings that provide you a distraction.
14988.0,Patient,"my brother. church. and probably this session or like a meeting, I guess, but even even meetings i've become I become interesting with people in there and I don't know why either. I told people I was going to go to church, instead of a meeting and I got like the most judging what G looks ever."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I can remember lauren people in long term recovery do it many different ways, and some people a has saved their life or in a or CA or ma one of the anonymous. But that's not how everyone recovers there's many people that do it a different way with maybe a therapist maybe going to different types of meetings i've had people that don't want to go to the to say in a they they decided that. codependency anonymous was where they felt like they were more of a match so it's going to look different and being able to just you know take back and go, you know what mine's going to look different. So being engaged in a meeting or a session could definitely be. A distraction, for you. Anything else with people or social setting that can provide a distraction, but could you call do you have like someone that you could call and say hey let's go get a cup of coffee or let's go walk in the park."
14988.0,Patient,"You know I don't at this time I don't think I do. Okay i'm trying to really establish that right now, like, I signed up for a bunch of groups at church tonight online. So I could start like connecting more with people, those this really nice woman, I met and I can't wait to see her again tomorrow night at church. And she seems like the type of woman that would totally go have a cup of coffee with me and I I forgot to get her number, I even forgot her name but she was a total stranger that I ended up sitting next to a church and she just held me during prayer and she just really. I went to this food drive the next day, and she was like I was looking for your car I was looking for you, and it was like the best feeling for somebody to just want to see me just because they wanted to see me."
705.0,Provider,And they.
14988.0,Patient,"felt like people want to see me because they want something out of me. Again, that where the hell that comes from I don't know it's always somebody wants something."
705.0,Provider,"Who do you know, three people that could be your support people if you needed help like would your brother be one person that you know."
14988.0,Patient,"yeah my brother would his his wife would absolutely she's somebody i've been kind of talking with a little bit here and there, with. um. And and and and and Melinda my friend Melinda she's like she's known me since I was like a little kid she's been really helping me keep me. Organized like Sometimes I get overwhelmed by stuff and. don't know where i'm starting and she'll get you make she's wanting to told me about making the list you know you make that list every day, and you check those things off and. And she you know, has me checking in with her, she had me check in yesterday and then she texted me back today, you know I know if I called her and told her, I was in crisis i'm i'm pretty damn sure she'd be there."
705.0,Provider,"Oh good i'm glad you have Melinda and then your brother What is his name. Jordan, Jordan and then Jordans whitesnake."
14988.0,Patient,Gillian.
705.0,Provider,"Is that Jay you Oh, I am."
14988.0,Patient,it's Jay I ll I am.
705.0,Provider,"Okay Julian i'm sorry not Julian Julian. yeah right i'm going to put that on your plan that's why i'm asking how to spell that, so I will put that on that safety plan. You know to what we do is two things that keep your environment safe like they're living environment safe I usually one of them is not to keep weapons around that sounds like something that you already do. If you're also you know with substances, including alcohol, I think all substances anything that changes your mood is that something that in your environment that you keep you know more of a clean environment."
14988.0,Patient,"Co I my brother's know he has alcohol and pot around and, to be honest it's it's whatever to me it doesn't even bother me, the only the only the only thing I could feel triggered by I think at times as pot, but again like. it's very strange it's like I recognize it to be just if it's a moment and I recognize that that's really not the direction I want to go I just think I think I do, but I know I don't know if that makes any sense at all."
705.0,Provider,"yeah part of it, too, can be especially when we're talking about keeping your environment safe it's just having people that you know that you can talk to like your brother. So with Jordan is in the event that you did for like a crisis, you could talk to Jordan and so. What I do to for the professional is there is a suicide hotline and what's it now, you can just dial 988. If you can't remember 988 just dial 911 and they would help you are go to the nearest emergency room is, if you need also to and i'll put this in your safety plan is a crisis text line. So the first 1988 is the Suicide Prevention hotline the text line is 741741 and it's a crisis counselor that you can talk back and forth with so it doesn't have to be specifically for suicide, it could be other types of crisis's that are happening and it's only text so. Like talking."
14988.0,Patient,I love that.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
14988.0,Patient,"I love that. yeah and then i'll. Mention I forgot to mention this other woman rhonda she's like a prayer warrior and she like I went to a healing room today at church that's been that's another coping thing for me is going the church and really like. Really cleansing mice my soul you. know your knowledge goodness and. It is very helpful and it feels very freeing and very good, but then I like I said I step out into the real world and I get all freaked out. But she's been amazing she's prayed for me with me over me she's just she's a godsend to and she's somebody I could definitely call and go have coffee with. You know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and so building those networks, who do you have like okay so then there's there's rhonda to would you consider rhonda also a friend like mental Melinda."
14988.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, I would, yes I would. So she's my. sister called me a soul sister today."
705.0,Provider,that's awesome.
14988.0,Patient,I thought it was cool to say always wanted lots of sisters.
705.0,Provider,"Now exactly what are some reasons that you can name like what is, what are your reasons why life is worth living."
14988.0,Patient,"Oh gosh because I have so much, I want to do, I want to travel, I want to get married, I want to have more children. I. want to give back and serve. Her God sees that that I have it, I sometimes feel like my whole journey and where i'm where i'm at today is going to be like this true testimony of where i'm going I don't know just down the line. yeah i'm just i'm not done and that's that's I guess that's why I get terrified like my time like Am I gonna run out of time, this is like you know standard our glasses. Oh, like a freak out a majorly freak out and, in my own worst critic because I I get scared that I won't get to actually do the things I really want to do, because now i'm free of drugs and i'm not arrested by habit, you know what I mean."
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly i'm so all this, you know there's a lot of things that again as you're going to get sober you're gonna realize that Okay, all these things are surfacing. So use everything you have some really good things sometimes people don't have the spirituality piece, and so draw that even closer at night, as maybe you know before you retire and go to bed is saying that prayer the serenity prayer just that alone is cognitive behavior therapy. You know it's that that change part is knowing you know the wisdom to know the difference. yeah anything that you can use like that lauren just start to like Okay, this is all about finding like you're using meditation. excellent way to ground yourself, so if you have in the future, those fleeting thoughts come in do a grounding exercise take a couple of deep breaths. You know, and you can do other ones for sometimes it's just five things around you that you can see, or things that you can hear three things that you can smell two things that you can maybe. You know, taste, if you have like coffee or candy or something around you and you can do that in different sequence but it's a grounding exercise, and it really can help with anxiety. When you start to feel you the heart is beating faster to start to ground yourself where it's like okay i'm going to interject my head. Okay yeah the breeding definitely helps for sure."
14988.0,Patient,Good.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, good good, so I appreciate lauren you've answered a lot of questions I. appreciate your openness and honesty. And um you know, so I have all the information here is there anything that you would add, in order for bright heart health to work with you, better is there anything you would want to add that I haven't asked."
14988.0,Patient,No i'm just super grateful that that you're here to help me and i'm glad you made this very painless.
705.0,Provider,"Good okay good good with that said to lauren I opened up the with your chart to see, and so you and I are going to be working together, which is great, do you feel like setting up an individual session we can knock that out right now get that scheduled."
14988.0,Patient,"Yes, please."
705.0,Provider,"Okay awesome Let me then go and pull my schedule up what days of the week, are you going to your groups. So on the individual sin and I work Tuesday through Friday, and then we try not to have two services on one day so Tuesday through Thursday we could schedule your individual groups."
14988.0,Patient,"let's do Tuesday again. Okay, Tuesday, this time was well, can we do it, maybe an hour sooner."
705.0,Provider,"Let me pull up the schedule and see what I have available there. let's see we're talking about a Tuesday Tuesday the 19th i'm looking at. So to sit and night to. that one is just looking for the slots there sometimes what happens to is things spoke up as as they go along on that. Friday. I mean i'm sorry on the Tuesday the 19th not seeing anything on that one, but let me see. me go back to to. So let's see the. there's. So i'm pulling up the 26. On the 26 lauren I do have let's see it would be the 530. or I have 530 or six o'clock. Would either one of those work for you or I can look at a different day."
14988.0,Patient,So is it every two weeks we made her every week we meet.
705.0,Provider,"out we work every two weeks is what it's on right now, but if you feel like you need more we can do that too."
14988.0,Patient,I think I think more would be good.
