3843.0,Patient,"yeah i've been i've been working six days a week, and I also had finals for school last week so i've been extremely busy."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, are you canceling when you're not making it to your group."
3843.0,Patient,"No, I haven't been."
148.0,Provider,"yeah definitely try and cancel because if you just don't show up, it comes as a no show and that could cause you to be out of compliance with the Program. Okay Okay, yes, definitely try and do that when you can't make it um so you've had a lot on your plate you're working six days a week and you had finals last week."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah I was tired, I was pretty beat us sweep. Was it was a busy week for work we have like a 250% like event with the company posted like their company Christmas party my work in the orders. are packed like our food package that comes to try to barbecued chicken and just like a lot of stuff so I had to go in and I was on Tuesday we did all the prep for it, which took like 10 hours between like the five or six of us that are there. wow i'm list and then started cooking and then we finish putting everything. Wednesday, but yeah it's just been crazy busy."
148.0,Provider,"So, how did finals go."
3843.0,Patient,"I think that went on right, I was pretty lucky one of my teachers said surprised if you have an A in the class you don't have to take the plane oh."
148.0,Provider,Oh wow that's awesome.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah so that was nice I have I had a 99% in the class, so I really agree sounds like full that's one that's classic i'm worried about. My other class I just had to do a presentation, like a four minute presentation and that went really well she actually gave me like 10 extra credit points for being so good, so it was nice. wow yeah and then I don't know what I got on my human resources cost yeah I think I did okay. Hopefully, I was like on the edge between an A and like to. Be I have an apron like i'm on the initial that's when I was first in a little bit sing with me anthropology class. i'm like right at the edge of that one of an eighth so I kind of needed in the navy to keep it, but I haven't gotten the grade I was struggling a little bit with my anthropology press that would sound online class. And I mean I had all week to do it, but I just again like I had like no time to work. So, on Sunday, when it was too, I was like rushing to finish my final and she was like really like a six page paper. that's where it kind of like, finally, caught up to me, the busy week. I got it done."
148.0,Provider,"yeah I got it done. Well, good luck in the classes you're not sure about but it sounds like you, are solid in school on getting really great great."
3843.0,Patient,yeah worst case I gotta be which is.
148.0,Provider,really good.
3843.0,Patient,"So really good i'm just i've never gotten a 4.0 before so really on it i've always been close like always won't be or something i'm like this is probably the closest i've been to like a 4.0 so I wanted to keep it but it's all right. And it's kind of a lot to do, while working full time so. i'll cut myself like a little slack."
148.0,Provider,At guys yeah give yourself some grace you're doing so much right now. yeah you're determined.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah it's been a little hard, though, because. i'm still getting like nowhere with trying to figure out like what i'm going to do, school wise everything everybody keeps telling me, I just have to go back for my masters in order to do human resources. And the two universities here that I want to think about buying don't accept students memory have bachelor's. So my fourth grade I don't know what to do, and neither of them has a masters in human resources, so my only option is private and I don't want to go to a private school because it's too expensive."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah so. they're they're telling you my best best to do certifications so. yeah that's something i'm gonna look into but I might keep going to Community college for like another semester, because. When teacher asked if I was interested in doing in human resources internship so I might as well stick it out and do an internship will be really helpful."
148.0,Provider,"Okay awesome so it sounds like you have a good plan yeah. Okay, good yeah was there anything specific that you wanted to talk about today."
3843.0,Patient,"i'm looking specific it's just been kind of a word like a. week or two just feels like a blanket of like overwhelming thread. And my work situation doesn't help because I never intended to go back to my own town it's just what ended up happening because I lost my job. it's just been really stressful it's just been kind of a lot and they don't think it's particularly a good company to work for, and that was the reason why I left to be dinner. And so, like coming into work every day, sometimes is difficult and like I was so frustrated on Sunday like I would, if I didn't have rent to pay. And would have walked out and then job because it was just it was just it was just a really bad day. For ELENA yeah I mean obviously that like overlying from Chris probably isn't helping anything but yeah it was it was hard to just want to do anything this President week week and a half. Obviously I pushed through and more going through the motions, but I was struggling, while I was doing everything."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm. So it sounds like. Your workplace could be detrimental to your mental health.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah very much so, I try to make it the best environment. But it's just hard you see like. You know, higher ups man exactly care about its employees and. Just like not taking into account, plus like my my boss is pretty burnt out. Because they take advantage of him and he comes in, with a shitty attitude everything and it's just super negative so it's hard when you're already dealing with depression and like you're on like. starting to go on like a low point of depression and then you also have like I mentioned before every shitty attitude makes the car Horn."
148.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely absolutely yeah and our environment plays a huge role in the way we feel, and if that's somewhere, are you there all six days. Okay, so you're spending a lot of time somewhere that just as a negative atmosphere for your for you."
3843.0,Patient,yeah and it's it's been hard. To just like overcome that. meet the best of it.
148.0,Provider,um. Have you thought or Have you considered looking elsewhere for.
3843.0,Patient,"The word means there is feel bad for my boss because he's like me to like basically is Brock and because and. He needs my skills, because i'm this person instead with administrative stuff and I get all that done so, he doesn't have to worry about. another country, they all they he approached me about taking on more of his responsibilities obviously compensation would. would follow but. And that's something that I almost want me to take into consideration is like is, can I can I continue being they're like well Can I make a difference to make things better. and will to get better my bosses and some wealth in the day to day operations on, and I was talking to one of my supervisors or co worker and I told him I was like I can't do this without you saying and we talked about like giving it one year in. Okay, and then reevaluating a year. I was like I confused like you're the only reason i'm saying when you came back you like that made it easier for me if I stayed on my camera on security be like I can't do it, I really can't. Because he's he's good at the more physical like candy kind of stuff whereas I handle the administrative stuff so we work really well together."
148.0,Provider,I know I remember you're in the restaurant business remind me where exactly you're at.
3843.0,Patient,"my birthday busy dreams it's like a smaller baseball Park, so we have like."
148.0,Provider,"Oh, you were in a restaurant."
3843.0,Patient,"know so it's a it isn't there's two restaurants on property. Each restaurant is attached to three baseball fields and then got like a full bar in there and then. it's a snack bar, but like we you know we do make like food and stuff like REPS and stuff like that burgers."
148.0,Provider,i'm. Okay.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah not your typical restaurant, which is nice or am I doing after working a very normal restaurant i've learned that I don't like just small restaurants work going on anymore."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay interesting okay so you're giving yourself a year. to work together with these people that you're close with and see you know what kind of positive changes, you can make."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah that, in its new ownership so maybe they'll be making changes and. If I give myself a year that I. could possibly still be going to school and still do that internship so it also gives me a chance to continue that. Obviously. Never post to reevaluating. sooner than that it's just at least, like all signed on going to existential crises that I normally do because every time I tried to leave when I was in the back there. And for me to feel stuck like career rides as hard. Because i'm a person that always needs to make progress, or I get really frustrated or really down on myself, so now be able to leave or being like constantly. Like ending up back there is very frustrating for me. Like i'm like."
148.0,Provider,A big part of you wants to stay and wants to make positive changes and be there for the people you care about. and work with them and making these changes and a big part of you doesn't want to be there.
3843.0,Patient,"That is, that is what i'm. kind of battling."
148.0,Provider,yeah so you're really at calm and conflict around this around your job situation.
3843.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,Have you weighed the pros and cons of staying and then the pros and cons of leaving.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah oh my Burmese afraid that i'm living. Like the fear of. I used to be a person that used to like if I wanted to do something I would just go do it it's how I ended up with as many tattoos and piercings is I have, especially the piercings so my. spiritual health, and I would just go do it and that's just kind of have been with like everything um. But ever since like how I lost my job, and you know the you know being written stuff I can't be so like rash with like certain things anymore. And so, part of me is kind of scary like what if it doesn't work out like what if I go like go again and if I leave the baseball park like I don't think I could have come back and. Like I was lucky, the last time I was able to come back and I don't think that's what like what extent they'd be like Why would we let you back like you're just."
148.0,Provider,"Saying that you. view going back or i'm letting you come back as lucky because. that's something that you no longer want to do right you don't want to you don't all I don't hear that um. You want to be there, and you almost feel stuck there."
3843.0,Patient,yeah I mean I guess i'm even more like the financial sense.
148.0,Provider,Okay okay that you're not left with nothing.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah like I could as basically, I never stopped working I transition from the grind and, like, I asked for a week of lent not really scheduling me because I was pretty distraught. And I was paid out early so like I was OK financially for like the rest of the week, because I, because I was salary, even though they let me go halfway through the pay period they still had to pay me for the rest of it so. was like I have the money, I got the page, or we. submit to me just take a week to processes um but even then, I was still a so pretty seamless I went from like working once every whatever and I was working both jobs to lean on us immediately, I was working five days a week. So financially, I was always okay. And uh yeah lucky in the financial sense."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm. gotcha all right, so it, it gives you comfort around the finances, but it around your mental health it's. yeah it's not good okay so both are really important right your mental health, I don't know if there's anything that's more important than that, but your finances, you know. Being actually stable definitely plays a role in your mental health, otherwise that would bring you a lot lot more stress in your life right. So these are really big. These are really big topics here. um it sounds to me that, where you're at right now, you have your mind made up that you want to stay for one more year and see. and see what what might happen, and if it sounds like if things remain the same, and it still is really challenging around your mental health to be there that you'll leave in a year."
3843.0,Patient,"So, like i'm still going to keep my eye out for different opportunities like i'm still making myself open. To you know you never know what's gonna happen, especially in a year, or you know, things can change like. Months month so i'm so like leaving i'm definitely not gonna shut things out, and I think a lot of it also depends, because they haven't discussed compensation in this company's very stingy. So if they're not willing to compensate me like to what I want to make then i'm not going to take the position and I am going to look elsewhere."
148.0,Provider,"Oh God OK OK OK, so I hear that you are putting yourself first here, and you know thinking about what's best for you all around."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I had, I have a job well for to leave soon after I I got like code. And I only I get my boss really wanted me to Spain and they don't want to give me what I wanted, but they were ended up going above when I would have made it the other jobs so that's also kind of going to face. And so my boss knows that, like i'm i'm not going to take us like anymore like before like I would have just to stand out, but like you said i'm trying to put myself first, and especially in this market of you know, in the restaurant business right now, like it's they're paying a lot more. So, like, if I could just go elsewhere and make more money weiner expressions, I want to leave anyways so my boss knows it kind of have to make it worth it for me to stay."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay good great boundaries. yeah stay true to yourself and keep those boundaries, because people will take as much as they can get right, so if you're not setting these boundaries and using your voice to you know advocate for yourself they're going to give you the minimum and to expect you to be okay with that."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah and this company is known for doing just that. I mean i've been there since 2017 so i've seen it a lot and i've been on the receiving end of it and I don't want to want to anymore i'm learning that I need to evaluate myself and like that's one of the things i've been practicing is like you know the men doing what I deserve and. Especially if you know they're telling me like hey you're like we really need you here it's like Okay, then, if you really need me you gotta compensate me, but you need me."
148.0,Provider,yeah give me a reason to stay.
3843.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm not I guess part of me is like worried about sounding selfish, but at the same time, like we make them so much from London. We make so much money, I was like, and I can see the financials I see that profit loss for the or the yeah there's all the sheets and stuff because i'm the one that does it and I can see just how much money the reference meeting, but I know you guys can compensate us better."
148.0,Provider,"huh huh good for you good for you yeah it's important to get what you deserve and not feel like you're being taken advantage of and then just to be acknowledged, for the hard work you are doing, I mean you're working hard six days a week. You know and saying that. um how are you taking care of yourself, right now, where you're at in the company, knowing that it's difficult and a negative environment and what are you doing to cope to get just to get through each day that you're there."
3843.0,Patient,Like on a day to day basis or like on a day to.
148.0,Provider,day to day basis.
3843.0,Patient,"Now a lot to be honest, if I can play like a mantra to have video games. They usually end up being tired so i'll just go to bed, so I have a really been great of self care even I can choose whether or not, today is a rules, my first for like actual they are. I slept for way too long. So, like i'm trying to be aware of like not to fall into like the pressure of it so like just like sleeping too much um yeah. I have been taking care of myself at all."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay so let's definitely set that as a goal to work on the self care. Whether that through meditation or. You know, positive self talk and affirmations are doing some journaling just something just some positive things for yourself because i'm hearing there's a lot of negativity in your work environment. So let's definitely work on that, and if you feel like you're you're having a lot of negative thoughts let's practice identifying those. And then reframing them, you know and what's the situation that caused me to have these thoughts really you know talking yourself through that because that's a scary place to be when we get really negative in our own head."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah and that's I can notice that that's something i've been struggling with link. Like those thoughts, just like i'll be working in those thoughts, just like negative thoughts or reruns of you know, things i'm still upset about like just like constantly going to write it down like why i'm just picking a burger place, why are we doing this."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay so How does that sound. To practice, some of these things for yourself. That sound reasonable or realistic for you to start to identify the negativity when when it's going on in your head and then try. You know the first step is identifying so we can just practice that, but if you feel comfortable you know start to reframe these thoughts into more positive ones. Okay, and then we'll talk about how that feels for you, the next time we meet, and if it makes a difference, you know just in your day overall. mm hmm yeah okay good i'm. gonna ask you today. um have you thought any more about what you're doing for Christmas."
3843.0,Patient,"No. my sister asked me actually have a song and she asked me what I was doing for Christmas. I told her I don't know yet so i'm really thought about it. yeah. I mean, I have, I said no, no, I want to do like i'm not i'm just going to stay home. Maybe maybe awesome by their house for a little bit because i'm sure to make them happy to see me for a little bit. And then, just like different feeling uncomfortable."
148.0,Provider,yeah you're really doing great with the boundaries in all areas of life yeah so you know going and. Spending some time with family and then removing yourself if you feeling like it's an uncomfortable situation.
3843.0,Patient,yeah i'm trying because i've always been a tough it out kind of person. And so i'm just trying to. I guess honor myself and the King of boundaries yeah. You know.
148.0,Provider,Like great work around that. yeah. I can hear you like you're really applying yeah putting yourself first.
3843.0,Patient,"I know well over time I just need to like go ahead and do it, and like alcohol pay was on there. So I know that's a little bit of my hurdles to the anxiety of things as well. And sometimes like when I just when I go. And then give myself that room that it's okay to leave or to leave early and then I might be like okay anyways."
148.0,Provider,"yeah I think my biggest concern right now would be. If you're isolating outside of work, just because you're working so much and then your time off, you know you just you probably don't want to do much because you're tired so. I would like to see you getting out of your comfort zone and putting yourself in situations that are outside of work where you can have some social activity and just you know connection. action and support is important."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah it definitely has been exciting part of it. Apart from these two weeks i've been isolated. So yeah everything might be good, and I know we have to be around my family and around my nieces and nephews. Really, a safer space to."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay good. So can we have you commit to showing up and then seeing how you feel and having a plan to remove yourself if it gets too uncomfortable.
3843.0,Patient,I will come in.
148.0,Provider,"Okay perfect all right, we got some Christmas. Okay Janet good work. See."
3843.0,Patient,"ya yeah i've noticed and me and him, and I mean cuz I don't always commit to everything, because I like to leave by granted, just like nevermind. So yeah assemble and just like turrets of things."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay yeah you deserve that to you, you deserve that connection. outside of work, and I just want to remind you right now to be patient with yourself, because you did just have a really overwhelming couple weeks. So listen to your body if you're tired it's okay to rest you don't need to beat yourself up over that or feel guilty about it. But just pay attention to the balance there. Right pay attention to the balance and. If you start to go too much into that isolation and the sleep and all that that you know leads to depression. Okay. Good sounds like some great goals great things that you're working on um anything else you want to talk about today."
3843.0,Patient,"I haven't written that letter yet um I don't, especially with everything going on."
148.0,Provider,yeah I figured.
3843.0,Patient,"i'd even the times, then I it's I don't think I was ready for it. I known some of like that's part of the thoughts that have moved into my head like is some of the things like I want to say. And I noticed myself getting very angry or upset when those thoughts come in tonight and honestly I don't know if I have the emotional. stamina while doing while trying to like get their work and school to also like deal with like that, so I haven't written it yet, but it's not something I forgot about it's."
148.0,Provider,"You have to be ready for it, so when you're ready and when you're when you get something on paper, we can talk about it. But I don't want you to push yourself if you're not feeling ready it's just something that we can continue to check in around and how you're feeling with those emotions and um how your healing process is going."
3843.0,Patient,yeah healing process anger.
148.0,Provider,"Anger right now yeah so if we look at the stages of. grief, I mean anger is a stage of grief right and technically, you are grieving this this past relationship. yeah yeah. mm hmm makes sense yeah so just allow yourself to be where you are to be where you are and know that there's emotions that are there under that anger, such as pain and sadness right um. But that the more that you process it and get support around this and let it out to you physically, whether that is writing about it, or just talking about it it's going to be helpful for your healing process."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah i'd even like through like instagram and I liked him his girlfriend and. Other people from like the gaming group, like I just like not that they're trying to contact me or anything but like I just don't want to see their names like even along with only I just. need them, like other sites, so that, like it's not just like a stab in the heart, every time I see them."
148.0,Provider,"I think that is the best, the best thing you can do for your healing have you noticed a difference, since you've done that."
3843.0,Patient,"are actually have I. Have notice. Like Oh, think about them a little less willing yeah."
148.0,Provider,what's helpful.
3843.0,Patient,Yes. yeah okay so yeah i've done that.
148.0,Provider,"was a big step, so you haven't written the letter, yet, but you did take a. big step from the last time we met yeah I just want to acknowledge how huge, that is, and how hard, that is to do."
3843.0,Patient,"It was especially I like I told you last time i'm one of those people that just kind of tends to leave the door just kind of cracked open for people, and so, for me to define black people and, just like no like i'm not like maybe this door open. yeah I guess yeah it's pretty huge I guess."
148.0,Provider,"That just demonstrates again that you are loving yourself and putting yourself, first in your healing and not putting somebody else where's that may come back around may not come back around right you're closing that door to. To. Take care of you."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah and so important one from social media but there's one person from nine group he does not have social media, so he. Like immediate last time I talked to them at the beginning of November, I made it clear to them like that I didn't like I didn't appreciate what happened in in like when they left me out there and stuff and. Like he didn't talk to me for over a month and then like two days ago he he texted me and i'm like it's my own fault I manifested it because I was like. Man he hasn't takes me in a month, I can fly he left me alone in like later that day he texted me, so I think that's like my next step is just basically telling them to leave me alone. Especially since he's basically into me he just wants to basically he just wants to sleep with me i'm i'm obviously not interested in all knowledge sitting in front of them. And so that's that's my next step is just. something nice and a song like i'm not interested at all."
148.0,Provider,"Well um um. I wouldn't I wouldn't label that as being me and I wouldn't label that as being selfish again I just a lot coming up today where you are just taking care of yourself. And if you don't take care of yourself, who will, and if you don't love yourself, who is going to write you, we have to practice, these things in order to attract the healthy things that we want in our lives."
3843.0,Patient,yeah so that's what i'm gonna do.
148.0,Provider,"OK OK. And when you feel ready, but identifying that this is something that you want to do is already a huge step."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah so that's that's something i'll do and that's basically the last time, a whole group of people."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good good to have made huge progress and separating yourself."
3843.0,Patient,"yeah, it is a bummer but you know it's it's been it's been."
148.0,Provider,"Passed yeah I agree, I agree, especially if you already feel. relief from it."
3843.0,Patient,And you're.
