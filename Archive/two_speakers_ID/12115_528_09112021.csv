528.0,Provider,Doing.
12115.0,Patient,"Fine, I just still water all over the place, but it's not okay."
528.0,Provider,Going back to work.
12115.0,Patient,"Sorry, say that one more time."
528.0,Provider,how's it been going back to your.
12115.0,Patient,"Oh um well a bit chaotic. But. Not. I mean, like the first day was. Well, honestly, the first day was kind of like a shit show, I mean there was so it was just so disorganized it was incredible like I don't think I don't think like public institutions should be allowed to be disorganized but uh well i'm not in charge um. anyway. So that was. yeah it was. I don't have a lot of time i've noticed that so i've been trying to i'm definitely this has been an A a week of adjustment um I had. I would say, I had kind of a rough time coming into this week, like. You know before it started, I was kind of building up my anxiety about things, and also about. Like I hadn't. I hadn't talked I had not really met the principal and so, at least not one on one, so I hadn't. I hadn't talked to her about sorry i'm just i'm having trouble converting Kelly i'm. Like I needed. I was adding pressure because, like Well, first of all I got to school on the first day and they said oh our school day doesn't end at three it ends at three or five, and I was like are you kidding me like. They change the school time nobody knew about there's like yeah I was printed wrong on the thing and now it's 305 and i'm thinking. Okay, that makes it even harder to get to group, like and I was like I i'm gonna have to talk to like I can't just like somehow try and you know, I was thinking if there's some way I can just like leave without you know telling anybody like somehow like work it out that it."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
12115.0,Patient,"That could happen, I was like no yeah you can't because you can't sleep your job early and. So I met the principal on the first day and. got to talk to her, which is like a few minutes, but like she put me enough at ease the evening them I emailed her, and I was like Okay, I have you know, a personal health issue that. I thought would be you know not resolved, as in like over with but I didn't think I would be in the group at this point, so I was like i'm so but it's not and I need to take care of this, and I said. So I didn't ask actually I said I said, I will be leaving school 10 minutes early Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays, I will take that I will make up that 10 minutes um. I will take her off my lunch and do because I have a half hour lunch so and I can eat in 20 minutes like. Okay that's not yeah cuz I was like. yeah that's fine because, like that's what I do during lunch is I just eat and 20 minutes is enough to eat lunch for me i'm."
528.0,Provider,i'm sorry hold on for one second I got.
12115.0,Patient,"Sorry, oh yeah."
528.0,Provider,Sorry.
12115.0,Patient,"i'm sorry I said i'll take 10 minutes from my lunch on those days and just do extra supervision duty because they're short staffed at that time, anyway, for supervision and she said, oh that's not a problem at all just let let your direct supervisor know. So. And I was like oh my God that was so easy all I had to do was. Tell ask you know. yeah um well and I did at the end, I said I I hope this is this arrangement is acceptable to you, please let me know. And i'm so like that was an enormous you know relief and then i'm because I have to miss coaching now to be here or be on the program days I had to find someone to step in and like substitute coach for me. and I was like oh God now, I have to tell the athletic director um you know and like kind of get through this, and so I haven't sent the email yet i've been working on it and I, my husband came came home, the other day, and he you know, has been helping me work through it to make it sound. The best you possibly can say like hmm i'm skipping out on practice um but i'm and i'm going to send it to. The ad this evening um and so. But it's like it, but it feels like all these pieces are falling into place now, and like yeah the school schedules really chaotic right now, and like i'm supposed to get a 10 minute break. And i'm unfortunately nobody's really noticed that during when i'm supposed to get my 10 minute break there are over 100 kids unsupervised outside so i've been supervising them and not taking my 10 minute break but i'm. i've been stepping out of class, you know, for five minutes to eat a snack then started another time until we get this sorted out because. You know, like the principal is very concerned about everyone getting their their brakes and everything and wants to make sure it happens, but we just lost another staff member not died, just like."
528.0,Provider,Oh it's like yeah.
12115.0,Patient,"Not school with co video can't deal with it, so you know we're trying to hire somebody else and we just don't have enough supervision and they're having to switch like we have 34 kids in the classroom right now, which is like too many even without coven. So they're having to make another section and hire another teacher it's just you know everything's kind of a mess right now. So the first day like On Monday I I just i'm going to say I I tried really hard not to gate engage in behaviors but I felt like all weekend Saturday Sunday and Monday I was just like. The whole weekend I felt like I was fighting behaviors and I just I got like Saturday like muddle through Sunday wasn't quite as good and then Monday was was not very good and I was just like. I just felt like I was spending all of my timeline trying to redirect and I had. I was home alone, and like I you know I called friends, but not only last for you know that's half an hour or like I will go. I did some work like office work and I was like okay you step another hour, but it was just like that's how my day was it was like okay I got through half an hour without doing any here. And it was just like I I got exhausted by it. And I, and I realized like. I was also so it was interesting to me because I realized, I was internalizing things like okay so on Saturday my husband ran the world mountain masters Championships in Austria and my son ran his first collegiate race and i'm both reported to me. somewhat disappointed. And I took all their disappointment like you know i'm i'm really proud of him that he did it, but he I mean he was racing. The altitude really impacted him let's just put it like that we're not at altitude and then he was running from 3000 feet to 6500 feet, but race was all uphill it was like brutal and he said that you know not having done any training adults YouTube it hit him hard. And so. He was hoping to get like in the top five and he ended up 12 and so out of 60 and i'm like whoa you know i'm proud that he did it i'm like impressed and everything. yeah but. I because i've been in you know I competed in college and stuff I know how it feels to like have that disappointment and I felt like I took on his disappointment and then like. You know I know he knows how to deal with disappointment my son, you know his his first collegiate race. But because of covert he hasn't raised for over two years and so he just he was like mom I just couldn't I couldn't push myself to the racing point you know I just was like kind of. In my fast comfort zone and he's like I kind of forgot how to race and I was like. You know I I went through the whole talk with him it's okay it's a rest buster you know, like. don't worry after a couple of you get a couple under your belt you'll you'll you know you'll relearning I said, all the right mommy coaching things. But then I was like oh God, you know out she's like I know how that feels to like you know your first race, you want to show that you're decent and then it's not as good as he wanted it to."
528.0,Provider,be right.
12115.0,Patient,"And you know, and when you're 19 your perspective is a little more like can't really see that big picture, which is why you need people to say things like that to you. But I really kind of internalize those things, and I also had a difficult situation, with my mom happen. So a lot of these things, plus the school anxiety and I just like. You know, and then I tried using coping mechanisms and then I just kind of like gave up after a while. um but I will say that since school is started um i've been like I feel. I don't know if you've been looking but I noticed that my moods have been like well there's been stress and frustration irritation, you know at various things it's not being overwhelmingly so and. And my i've had a lot more positive feelings and like excitement I think that's partly because you know, Fiona and Ian came home so i'm feeling, you know really a lot more supported you know because I have people around. yeah and i'm. excited because you know it's exciting to start school, even if it is stressful and like you know meeting trying to learn every single sixth graders name who's in a mask like. huh um anyway so it's i've been feeling a lot more. Even I guess about it and i'm like and also after the first day I was like you know I can take all of the stress. That you know, like there's not the right lunch, she will region there's not enough stuff I can't control any of that I can only control. What I can control and one of those things is how I handle it and my emotions and stuff like that, and I was talking to one of my co workers, and I was like yeah I don't know like you know i'm not getting my 10 minute break and she's like you know what. I you know. She said there's somebody else somebody else didn't get a lunch break at all yesterday and she's like but. i'm not gonna you know it's not my problem i'm taking my lunch i'm looking out for me and I was like at first, I was like gosh that's selfish but i'm like no that's healthy because, like you know if you're running around worrying about like whoever Mr lunch break needed to say hey. yeah don't have a lunch break like. Somebody needs to give me one like you don't just settle, you have to advocate for yourself, and I was like. yeah debbie you do you you take that lunch break. And so, like. And i've also noticed my intentionality and my lunch breaks like. i've had. Like every every day, I have had all kinds of opportunity to skip my 10 minute break whoa or you know, not even try and get a snack in there, because I don't actually have that 10 minute break quite yet, but. You know I stepped out of the classroom and I, you know I just I said that I had to go to the restroom I did go to the restroom but I went to the restroom and I, you know, try to yogurt drink a string cheese whatever you know um. And you know it'll be less less harried in the weeks to come. But, but I noticed that, like when it was my lunch break my intentionality was not to like distract myself on my phone or read a book. More whatever. Or you know make phone calls and try and schedule that dentist appointment six months in the future. That was just to sit down and eat. My lunch and. Like and that's not late last year. I will try and figure out ways that I could you know eat a few bites of my lunch and then have to do something else, so that I. didn't end up eating it and i'm also been packing so for the last two years, I packed the same lunch. Right i'm not talking i'm talking different stuff which that's, not to say that, like I won't have the same lunch again, but I, I really wanted to make sure that I didn't fall into oh i'm back at school, this is my school pattern."
528.0,Provider,"Right right yeah you mentioned that the other day just kind of making it do it differently or whatever yeah. um yeah so did you were you able to eat, like all the snacks on your lunch, like the whole week."
12115.0,Patient,"Or did yes so that's. I actually um so I wasn't in group on Tuesday, when we normally set diary cards, but I decided that, like that was going to be one of my diary card things is three meals three snacks just to make sure I like I will say that some of my snacks weren't what they should have been. Like I mean weren't as much as they should have been but um. I was able to have something that each time and i'm. i'm anticipating that next next week we're going to have this worked out a little bit better and i'll be able to have you know more than a few more minutes for that snack. And afternoon snack it's not a problem I have a transition window between school and coaching so that's not a problem at all, or if I come to group, I can always eat a snack."
528.0,Provider,group so that's okay yeah okay yeah so um. And breakfast you're eating at home right. yeah why i'm.
12115.0,Patient,"Although like I will say that i'm not like. The set Maybe it was the second day of school like I ate some at home, and then I i'm not sure which day it was but anyway, I felt like I should have had like a little more so, then when I got to school like I had some juicer or something like that. That I just lumped in with my breakfast recording because I anyway. um but yeah i'm eating breakfast at home and yeah i'm making sure that I have so that was another thing I used to do was. make myself so busy in the morning, that. I would kind of just pretend breakfast and nobody would really notice, because I was in the kitchen doing this and that and like. But i'm not i'm not doing, I mean like this morning I didn't really. Sit like. This morning was a little frantic just because it was feeling today was feeling a second day of school and i'm in the morning she's like Oh, I have all these forums, I need to have signed and like Oh, I need a binder you know, like like could you know have told us last month. But anyway, that you know you know how that goes and so it's a little more frantic than I wanted, but I didn't let it stop me for me like I was moving around eating breakfast like I didn't. But i'm. All right, like the day before I have time to sit down and. eat breakfast but I still like I eat a slice it I don't. I don't know I wrote it down I don't know if I put in my. Today, oh. yeah so I had like oh I haven't a photo of it, but I didn't upload it yet um. So let's see so yeah so I have like a muffin and like a little slice of pizza leftover pizza from last night so yeah I I ate stuff I just didn't. All record everything later, sometimes I just I don't have time early at school i'm not supposed to have my phone out so i'll just like jot down some notes on paper. And i'll put it in later."
528.0,Provider,"Okay okay. um. yeah I mean and and I definitely want to acknowledge like like. What you're saying, as far as like comparing how you would have normally been approaching the meals or your intentionality around the meals, I feel like. that's progress right there you know, for you to be like sounds like you're actually prioritizing your meals and snacks like rather than. You know, doing everything you can to not eat the meals and snacks so good that's good job."
12115.0,Patient,"yeah and I also. um I made, I put a bunch of like yogurt drinks and smoothies in the refrigerator at school with my name on them so. That I have like. Like when I didn't really have time to have a snack I can go and just like. You know, have have a yogurt drink or like I found they have these breakfast smoothies that are like they're almost 400 calories he was like whoa I should get i'm gonna get some breakfast foods and stick those down there that like, if I could drink that i'd say. that's not bad yeah pretty tasty they. come in late i'm barely oatmeal in them, or something it's like. Oh, there are. made by bolt bolt house farms. Like. there's like a peach peach and one in the strawberry one and so."
528.0,Provider,"yeah good um yes, because I noticed I don't it looks like you didn't have any smoothies like I noticed I guess you might have started school on Tuesday wait now you had a smoothie in the morning on Tuesday, but then I didn't see too many smoothies after that um."
12115.0,Patient,"yeah I took one today, but I didn't it's not recorded yet yeah I don't know I just I kind of went office smoothies for just about now I, like, I just wanted to break for a little bit, but now i'm like knowing. Okay, on board."
528.0,Provider,"You substitute with that, though, because I don't want you to just take a break and then not have something else."
12115.0,Patient,yeah. um well those the yogurt drinks are pretty good I like those um.
528.0,Provider,How many calories are those.
12115.0,Patient,"I think they're at 160. Okay, I can even if they're not all email you and you know, but there are about that, I think I think it's the same as like a yogurt cup about well, I guess, those are different Those are all different. yeah I think they were 160 there either 161 71 or one."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you're going to use that and the other thing too is i'm just looking here like i'm because remember how we talked about like the smoothie should be like kind of in addition well originally you were."
12115.0,Patient,"Yes, and not like yeah."
528.0,Provider,yeah so like if you do.
12115.0,Patient,"I do feel like so that. Oh, like. I like today, if you I only log lunch today because I was my phone was out I can have my phone out lunch, and so I was like logging right after eight. yeah but. So, like I I increase like I was i've been I was trying to increase my portions a little there so like I ate more Curry chicken salad because I did notice that yesterday, like all right, my lunch like a have lunch and then. By afternoon snack. Like I love being a substantial afternoon snack because I was too hungry, and so I think I note that I put on that was that, like. I should have had oh yeah because in the morning, my morning snack was string cheese kombucha and crackers that was like I didn't even get to string the string cheese and that's half the fun because I just like. yeah Ada you and i'm so um yeah I just felt like I kind of didn't get enough in in the morning, so I was like yeah okay that's something I need to know i've been trying to like. My big theme for this this week has been like awareness kind of like trying to i'm sorry i'm looking for a piece of paper, where I wrote something about this yeah oh i'm sitting on it okay. that's a mouthpiece paper. All my math and everything is getting all mixed up with. Okay, so um let's see. Okay, so well yeah I was i've been wanting to just um so actually in intentionality and awareness, was one of my target behaviors on my diary part, so I put three meals three snacks. i'm the water thing, because when we have to where i'm like God in the cat in my life to drink in the classrooms anymore, because everyone has a mask on so like. In order to. Sorry, say that again."
528.0,Provider,"Oh sorry I just said, even just to take a SIP of water, you have to you well okay."
12115.0,Patient,"So I mean, but we have like 34 kids in our classroom so we're we're not even three feet distant we're not compliant yeah so. You can step out of the room to have like anyone's allowed to step out of the room to have a drink, but that is not good for me because it's a whole other level of effort, then."
528.0,Provider,To actually drink yeah.
12115.0,Patient,"So um. That has. definitely wanted because, like yesterday I was so thirsty like in the middle of the night, last night I got up and drink 10 ounces of water at two in the morning because I woke up and I was so thirsty. I was kind of weird because, like I woke up because I had to go to the like I had to pee so badly and then I realized, I have to pee really badly but i'm also super thirsty was just a weird. So I just went to the fridge and just like. drink drink drink drink and I got back in bed and went right back to sleep but. um but yeah so i'm that's what that's one of my things and then. Daily intentions was something that I decided to do, and that was something like Sarah would always say that it, she would Journal and and like write down her daily intentions and so. I was like i'm going to take a page out of sarah's book actually to because she did three meals and three snacks all the time, too, but i'm so like i'm. On Wednesday, I wrote like it doesn't have to be a lot, but I Journal and journaling every morning I wrote. Happy Birthday to me today my intention is to give myself the gift of a behavior free day I intend to be positive today and to advocate for my needs and then i'm. Like also let's see what was this one of today's was I wanted fuel myself well today and be mindful and aware of first cues if I have a strong emotion, I will notice and acknowledge it and try to simply be aware, about aware of it, without reacting. I would also like to complete the daily dare of opening up and sharing a success with a friend, because that was the daily dare. So yeah I, and I feel like. Studying my intentions like and then like yesterday was my intention is to be aware of my emotions and accept them and my urges but to sit with urges and after that. Okay, and I wrote, I will check in with Anastasia for accountability because we've been I like after I had that bad day on Monday I texted her and was like you know, is it can you be my accountability buddy and I can. check in with you after ate lunch at school and stuff like a lunch and then i'm the evening i've been just checking in with her just you know I i'm. Nothing like I don't know if I need to reassure you of this, but I feel like I need I feel like I need to reassure you to reassure me that we're not like no triggering messages."
528.0,Provider,or anything like that.
12115.0,Patient,Just like. You know I I was able to you know use my coping mechanisms and not engage in behaviors or whatever and she's been doing a little bit of the same back so. It. feels like a really positive kind of. abandoned for. And I just I felt like. I was really able to i've been really trying to set myself up to have things move forward. I honestly like i'll say that this week has been a bit chaotic just because. Everything is.
528.0,Provider,Like your. blocks yeah.
12115.0,Patient,"But I think I am creating. a really good framework. In order to like. You know okay crazy week next week, now that I have like I know i'm doing my intentionality I am. You know my lunches have gone well i've eaten lunch i'm not skipping them i'm advocating to you know, take a break, and you know have something you know it's not time i've been eating breakfast not faking breakfast. yeah um and. yeah so i'm feeling like i'm i'm setting myself up for this to go go forward well. I have. One coworker at school, who knows everything that's going on and um you know so. she's been just checking in with me here and they're just like rb we're not like we don't really have any of the same stuff but we see each other, you know, in passing, a lot and. yeah you know she'll check in with me like you know, did you do, she is maybe she's like did you eat your lunch today, yes, I did."
528.0,Provider,"Oh that's so great it's wonderful to have like people, you can reach out to in person, and then you know not in person kind of thing. You know, so I along those lines i'm wondering like so we were actually talking about at the meeting today like about your behaviors and. Somebody brought up that I guess it hasn't decreased, and like we'd like to see the behaviors decreased. And the idea came up about like have being accountable to somebody not just Anastasia but like. Either ELENA or me or like the whole group or you know I guess you know they've done this with other people kind of implementing this thing around like within 24 hours you report if you use the behavior, for example."
12115.0,Patient,"So somebody mentioned that and i'm so I wrote that down, and that was something that I wanted to to do and I I was um. So if I The thing is, like I didn't know I figured like it would make sense to report to like. One one person so like maybe, could I send you an email if it like in the 24 hour thing and yeah I was kind of noticing to that like. i've had some like you know there's been some weeks that have been better, but like on average yeah the behaviors really have have not well. I guess prior to because, like, I think, just before I started writing heart, it was like you know, I was engaging and binge purge behavior like you know over 20 times a week. So it, it is a huge reduction. yeah it's kind of like. plateaued at this like massive drop off and then like yay but now we need to go somewhere from here. and actually That was something I was thinking about for this week, I was like I really want to. stress this and challenge it and see cuz I like so now it's then. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday so that's four and then. Like tomorrow i'm anticipating Of course I always anticipate it's going to be a good day right, but like Ian still home tomorrow and I have, I have to get on the cross country bus at 545 in the morning, and so I will be at a cross country need all day. I mean it'll be great fun, but it's a long day."
528.0,Provider,yeah and you gotta pack all your food.
12115.0,Patient,"Oh yeah definitely. yeah um yeah so um. yeah so I work six days a week, actually didn't think about that um anyway so. And yes, but I did think about packing my food um. Because that's Another thing I used to do is like oh I didn't bring any food which we can eat it or or give my food away to athletes who like. i'm i'm hungry sorry my food um. But um. So yeah and I was like oh that'd be really cool to get like a five day stretch because i've only done that, like once before in the program I think like two weeks ago. So I was like I think that yeah like within 24 hours if I could like send you an email that. would be. that'd be a really good and that's a good motivator to because I certainly I certainly don't want totally you engage in behaviors like and this yeah yeah so that's good."
528.0,Provider,yeah sorry I was just gonna say I wonder if you could do you want to message me privately on group me because i'm just thinking I don't check my email.
12115.0,Patient,That sure.
528.0,Provider,"But, like the group me message I pretty much get like you know you got first probably."
12115.0,Patient,Okay yeah I didn't think about that. brittany's new to me so. yeah I don't always jump to that um yeah so let's let's say that's. Nice to do i'm going to write that down. To zero is. Great and I have no idea I feel like my brain has too many things in it and are falling out. it's probably because of all those kids means.
528.0,Provider,"Well yeah i'm a busy I mean you've got such a shift this week with everything you know just you're trying to figure out your your schedule. Eating scheduled food schedule, like all this like you said, the names like it's a lot, I can I can understand, I mean i'm kind of also think as you're talking about this. And he had this is just a thought I have like your it sounds like you're doing you're much more active than you were so i'm thinking like you're like."
12115.0,Patient,"Actually, I would say no. I mean i'm The one thing that I am noticing like i'm not I wouldn't tell him any more active than I happen in fact i'm probably moving around less at school than I do at home. But I am standing up and I was like why nice feeling kind of like tired today and I was like oh it's because i've been standing up a lot more at school. um but but yeah I wouldn't say that my movement is anymore."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
12115.0,Patient,But I would say it's less.
528.0,Provider,But even just.
12115.0,Patient,So standing standing.
528.0,Provider,Standing takes more energy than just sitting so. You know.
12115.0,Patient,"I kind of figured it was probably equitable, because I feel like i'm moving around a lot less i'm just standing up more so I kind of thought it would probably equal out."
528.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. i'm. it's enough of a like I definitely want to push you to try to you know, keep working on, you know, like the things we talked about with the protein shake and. yeah and also like like I think, maybe going if you have that meal plan, if not, I can send it to you again, but i'm just going to share my screen for a second just so maybe we can kind of see where the holes are. Remember, we talked about this back um hold on one, second, let me just. Okay, so like I feel like hold on i'm just going to look at your. I think for breakfast let's look at breakfast, what do you think So where do you think the whole any holes are in breakfast."
12115.0,Patient,"um let's see, I think. Oh Okay, I was kind of I was looking at all of that all three examples I was like wow that's a lot of."
528.0,Provider,bro yeah.
12115.0,Patient,"So, like yet if we look at like yesterday's breakfast where I had the coffee the muffin the cantaloupe do group drink of water um I kind of feel like. Well, I guess, I would say media protein was missing there but don't like. Those muffins I there's a photo of it after I taken a bite, then I realize I forgotten photograph it, but like I know they're they're like the densest muffins they're like. Small boulders I don't even know I don't know what they're made out of but it's like they're super dense and there's um so they're really filling so I don't know."
528.0,Provider,Did you or did you buy it.
12115.0,Patient,"I they're made by our co op. Okay, and they're like I mean the ingredients are listed there actually it's weird because they're like. I think a wheat free actually or something like like I was surprised because I like I don't. Do I don't do gluten free stuff because it normally tastes really strange but it's like almond flour, or something instead and it's like they're super dense there's like full of nuts and raisins and carrots and. yeah I don't even know."
528.0,Provider,um.
12115.0,Patient,But yeah I think like maybe adding a protein to that.
528.0,Provider,"I think that sounds um I think that sounds good, because you've got the fruit. you've got the dairy or the milk you've got like i'm going to assume the muffin has that in it like it probably has like. Oh it's."
12115.0,Patient,it's one of those things where like if you hold it your hand is greasy so.
528.0,Provider,I can almost like see the you know. glistening yeah um. So yeah I would say the protein is the one thing that's that we that's kind of the whole in that particular meal.
12115.0,Patient,"So what like there. Are some was gonna say the day before. I think so, like the day before there was a yogurt train the cantaloupe and i'm toast with butter, but I probably should have had like. Another piece of toast or like even like put making like. A toast sandwich or something with a peanut butter in it, or. Maybe."
528.0,Provider,"You got it exactly if he did the peanut butter, instead of well then you'd be missing a button well yeah I was gonna say if you did the peanut butter sandwich and then you at least like the peanut butter would be your protein. mm hmm and the two pieces of bread is your grain, but then you'd still like."
12115.0,Patient,I have a dairy fruit or two.
528.0,Provider,"yeah and then actually I would say, you could use the peanut butter. Like it's got the fat in it so it's got a protein and fat So if you use like two tablespoons I think that's good enough to cover. Both yeah. Those things i'd say that's okay."
12115.0,Patient,"But then like. Okay, I guess, I have a question because, like, for my morning snack. yeah that day I I have string cheese crackers and water and I wrote out acquit because I felt like so it says inadequate adequate or excessive is that, like how am I supposed to regard those like. yeah right like. cuz sometimes. i'll say adequate when it like if it fills me up, but even if I know that it wasn't like. It was that was not an adequate snap right, I mean are not asking i'm saying that's a rhetorical right so yeah it was not an adequate snark like, if I had added a smoothie to that, then it would have been Okay, but. At the time, like it, I wasn't hungry anymore, so I said. Not to quit. And then, like sometimes you know, like, I would say, like that felt, you know that seemed like an excessive amount of food that I, even if it wasn't the right amount, so how am I supposed to. Am I supposed to do it in regards with like what i'm supposed to. start and pointing you can. clean up the meal plan. yeah is it. Is it in regards to like if i'm following the meal plan or how i'm feeling."
528.0,Provider,yeah that's a great question.
12115.0,Patient,"Because i've gone back and forth, and so, probably doesn't make any sense any of my answers, there really."
528.0,Provider,"So yeah i've actually kind of it's i've never nobody's ever like asked this question but i've noticed it in the wreck and the log myself when i'm. Like just looking at your log or not just yours, but other people's too, but like where is actually where i'm anyways, but I would say I so because you're when you say adequate you're using your like stomach feeling as like to say whether it feels like enough is."
12115.0,Patient,"not always sometimes i'm like. didn't sometimes I look at it, and I say inadequate it's because I know like I didn't meet like So if you look at my morning snack from yesterday. I said. Five ounces kombucha string cheese and crackers and I wrote inadequate because I knew that I did not eat enough, but I felt fine I just knew that it wasn't enough. Okay, but the day before. yeah I also knew it wasn't enough, but I felt satisfied physically, so I said I didn't quit so like, if you look at my logs like it's just ridiculous."
528.0,Provider,"yeah I see what you're saying so, I would just from this point moving forward let's like agree that it's like so because you're you're able to measure your hunger fullness I would use fullness as like that's your. place to put like how full you feel and then adequate or inadequate is like what you what you've been doing as far as like according to your meal plan, you know that that was not. Some spots, you know."
12115.0,Patient,Okay.
528.0,Provider,"And I think that would actually be helpful. To do it that way, because then we can see like. Again, like where the holes are like how many times, did you miss something you know, I think. I hear it like for you, I don't know if you have this like I would recommend that you pull this out or I don't know put it on your phone take a picture of it put it on just some somewhere where it's like. You know, you can unless you have it memorized like."
12115.0,Patient,"Oh no, I do not."
528.0,Provider,You know.
12115.0,Patient,"i'm sure I have it somewhere, but would you mind sending it to me because it'll be a lot easier to find the team. yeah and then yeah I will put on my phone was, I think that would be. helpful and maybe helped me target that a little bit better."
528.0,Provider,yeah I think. So um yeah and then again like I said.
12115.0,Patient,"I will say, though, that, like. On September the eighth."
528.0,Provider,Like okay.
12115.0,Patient,"Well, my morning snack was not adequate, like I ended up having like an unplanned um. You know, big slice of birthday carrot cake with frosting and five. So that I felt like you know it kind of balanced it out, you know in in the Grand scheme of things which I guess is you know that's what intuitive eating. yeah The goal is eventually to get there, but um."
528.0,Provider,"Yes, and actually that's really i'm glad you pointed that situation out because you know. to acknowledge that you could have just been like I already had my snack I don't I can't have another one, so the flexibility is really. I want to acknowledge that because, like you were able to just spontaneously have. That that I don't know if you knew that was happening, I was definitely unplanned that that birthday cake, you know you were able to just have it and not like say, well, I already have my snack so I can have that like did you get what i'm saying."
12115.0,Patient,"yeah well I it was it was unplanned because I, one of the girls on the cross country team works at a bakery and so she showed up with this. Big carrot cakes LACE just one for me in a box and I was like oh i'll save it for later and then, just like the team went out for their run and I was just sitting there waiting and I was like Oh, maybe I better have a little bit of it now and then I was like. And then, it was like I felt it was kind of scary because I felt like I couldn't stop eating it because it was so tasty and um. And it did make me I was like oh no no i'm making a half to like Persian this because I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing and. But I didn't like I was like no that's my birthday cake like that was awesome cake it tasted so good, and I got like eight eight my piece of birthday cake like no it's okay."
528.0,Provider,"yeah did you did you feel like you compensated in any way like after that, like I didn't look at your dinner or anything like, in other words, did you feel like you couldn't eat as much for."
12115.0,Patient,"Well, I did think okay I won't have I won't have dessert tonight been like I won't have any birthday desert in the evening, but then you can see, I blew that one because. That was when in and Fiona came home and I ate dessert at almost midnight on and so no I felt like like I made a good dinner like a. You know I had a pile and noodles with the veggies and stuff I mean I didn't make a super fancy dinner, because it was just me, but it was like. I had to cook it like I had to chop everything up and couldn't it was all I had to make it all and. And then yeah, then I was like oh I won't won't but then I got a message from in like yeah we'll be home sure we'll have dessert with you. And, and I was like oh Okay, I guess i'm having tiramisu so um no I don't think I I mean I didn't need a giant amount of JEREMY Sue, but I have you know, Jeremy so um so."
528.0,Provider,"Were you because I just noticed your. Would they let you know our because I see, they do eat dinner at seven and then like you didn't have that total of 30 so but normally your staff your nighttime stack is earlier right like."
12115.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
528.0,Provider,"yeah oh you kind of just. um I don't know if I just press something to you, but anyways."
12115.0,Patient,um I don't think so I don't see me.
528.0,Provider,But so you kind of knew a few hours before and you kind of wait it you held off.
12115.0,Patient,yeah yeah. Okay um yeah cuz they sent me a message like around getting our time saying when because they weren't exactly sure when they were going to be back.
528.0,Provider,I see.
12115.0,Patient,"Okay, so yeah normally normally fast asleep by 1130."
528.0,Provider,"yeah you've had yeah I didn't even like I and. When you were talking about like How crazy this week has been for you i'd like it's like and then you had your birthday, on top of it it's like."
12115.0,Patient,yeah I only got five hours of sleep that night.
528.0,Provider,"But yeah I think um let's let's try to focus on like you know meeting, making sure you're meeting. The you know basic exchanges."
12115.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
528.0,Provider,"The only thing i'm going to add and i'll actually it's probably good that i'm sending out I can't edit it here, I guess, I might have oh here yeah i'm just going to add the protein shake because that was a new thing that we've added since we had well."
12115.0,Patient,I was more like a smoothie that we added me right. yeah I did I think enter that picture of one it was like uh. yeah I think I saw. yeah the vanilla protein one.
528.0,Provider,uh huh.
12115.0,Patient,"I wasn't entirely sold on that one it just it just a funny I would try it again i'm gonna i'm gonna give it another go but i'm. Like I mean there's plenty of it it's not like I need to get one with like the added protein, because the breakfast ones have some protein in them as."
528.0,Provider,"Well, and."
12115.0,Patient,The vanilla Chai one that I do a custom protein in it.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, and also, I mean I don't think you're necessarily in a protein deficit, like you, you know you're able to get protein and other sources. But like your lunch, you always have that chicken salad or attempt bay and dinner your."
12115.0,Patient,are usually have some protein with Center. yeah.
528.0,Provider,"But anyway, the thing that i'm I want to focus, I want you to focus most on is the calories. Okay, like I want any like again if you're going to do, you can either do and i'll give you this option if you want to do, like a 500 calorie smoothie and one and, like have that as one of your life with one of your snacks or you can break it up into like half and half like do."
12115.0,Patient,Okay.
528.0,Provider,"So just but, like the total amount that's going to be added, in addition to the food is like."
12115.0,Patient,I want I.
528.0,Provider,"can do like 500 calories. Does that sound triggering to you at all, I just want to know, like if if anything comes up when we talk about calories and."
12115.0,Patient,"No, I, I think we talked about this, the last time, a little bit late. And number it's not. The numbers not. A big deal to me like you're not."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
12115.0,Patient,It doesn't then that doesn't mean a lot to me like I don't really think about calories so it doesn't know it's not triggering.
528.0,Provider,Okay okay.
12115.0,Patient,But the long and the short of it.
528.0,Provider,Usually I don't you know for a lot of people is very triggering which.
12115.0,Patient,i'm sure yeah.
528.0,Provider,"You know, but I remember the last time we talked about it was not for you so just double checking."
12115.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"But yeah, so I think. Do you think well do you think you can work on that, like does that feel like doable to you to try to you know get all the food, plus the smoothie doesn't feel yeah."
12115.0,Patient,"I mean it feels a little bit intimidating but um. I think it's a good good thing to try like you know. yeah well, I mean I think i'm. My I mean, I think it was you know, I was getting in more smoothies before and I think it was work I think my weight went up um, and so I you know, I think it was working."
528.0,Provider,"And it's definitely improved I will tell you that yeah so that's good so so yeah but oh yeah, this is what I wanted to ask you um i'm I just emailed loretta before we. got on our call and i'm like oh is asking her for the weight, but i'm assuming you didn't did you see her this week."
12115.0,Patient,"I did not see here this week I called her to to figure out like cuz i'm I was like well, is it Okay, if I just like. Russian like do it, how much leeway Do I need to give you like, if I just run in at some point to do it, and she said, we can. We can set that up and so i'm i'm i'm going to rush in next week and just get a quick way, and she said that's totally fine I can totally do that, so I will do that at the beginning of the week next."
528.0,Provider,"Yes, please yeah and then like I guess that's you'll just have to do that regularly like can."
12115.0,Patient,Do Russian yes.
528.0,Provider,"i'm sorry, can you hold on one second. All right, i'm."
12115.0,Patient,kids.
528.0,Provider,"yeah I did I actually needs to just make sure my husband goes to pick up my daughter is because otherwise could be really late so i'm sorry. Let me just stop sharing this for one second. Okay sandy hear. me here. Okay, moving right now. sorry about. Oh, my gosh okay um. So what are we saying. Oh, about the weights so. trying to figure out how to."
12115.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Do that okay yeah I definitely want to make sure that's consistent and then the other thing is. And I can all talk to your doctor about this, but the.we have a doctor who I just met for the first time right heart health and he was saying that it would be a good idea for you to get like an ekg done. Have you had that done. anytime you have okay like before you started. mm hmm um is that, like, I mean I know you have challenges with getting places, you know, like getting to the Doc is there a place that you could do nearby."
12115.0,Patient,"Probably not um because we have so much code here right now, our hospitals are like. They don't even want people for coming in. And they've shut down some departments in the hospital and they don't want people coming in it, if they like if it's not a life critical thing um. But I can't let me email my signups doctors. it's probably quite soon enough Oh, why do I need a kg."
528.0,Provider,"Well, they want to you know just monitor your heart with, especially with the purging still going on, they want to make sure that, like. You know I mean your electrolytes were in Babylon we're actually because I got your labs from last week, so that looks good your glucose was a little bit low did she did she send you the labs. yeah Okay, so you probably saw some of it um but. Like you know the body can compensate for that, like it's like oh it's not uncommon for allowed to look pretty good, but you know even because the body can just adjust. So he was saying, it would be a good idea to just get another ekg I don't know I think he said weekly but um."
12115.0,Patient,I don't I can't afford. And I don't think um well what if I.
528.0,Provider,What if I.
12115.0,Patient,What.
528.0,Provider,"I just said, start with just one for now like."
12115.0,Patient,Okay let's What if I right got the behavior down to once a week or something when I done still need an ekg.
528.0,Provider,"I took a thought I was actually kind of thinking that too, I was thinking like if that would motivate you to like you know decrease your behaviors maybe that would be something we can talk about yeah yeah."
12115.0,Patient,"All right, well, I will talk to my doctor and see and then like I can. also check in like the hospital like yeah I just don't know, I have a friend who works at the hospital nice to talk to her this week just hang out with her this weekend. Okay Oh, I will ask her what the scoop is up there, because she always gives me right so of like what they're letting people do and not. And she knows everything that's going on with me, too, so I can you know say this."
528.0,Provider,Year yeah.
12115.0,Patient,yeah she's a nurse up there.
528.0,Provider,So okay great.
12115.0,Patient,um says it's absolutely terrifying.
528.0,Provider,"Was. Oh, in the hospital. yeah yeah yeah I can imagine. um but yeah I feel like i'll get more clarity. On the weekly thing, but I and i'll talk to that everybody and see like if that would be something you know that's okay to open up like. You know if you can get your behaviors down like I think that was a big focus is like everybody, you know alana and like Catherine and everybody was like they want to see your behaviors go down so. If that happens, I think they'd be more open to like not having to like do all this monitoring and paste like that. yeah."
12115.0,Patient,"Well that's a good motivator. I have to say, because I don't. Like it, I mean like I don't really care about getting my blood drawn I really care about the cost is like you know, because even though I have insurance is still cost me a shitload of money. To go in."
528.0,Provider,wow right.
12115.0,Patient,Oh yeah like it's it cost me more to get my blood drawn then to go to a week of sessions at brain hurt it's ridiculous.
528.0,Provider,that's insane.
12115.0,Patient,"Right, when I got full lab Panel for. Today, to get in with the ekg and labs and it was over 500 it was $500 with insurance."
528.0,Provider,wow that's surprising yeah.
12115.0,Patient,yeah well that's that's One of my reasons why yeah so yeah I think you're on board with that. that's.
528.0,Provider,"You know that, like this is all coming from like we want to make sure your."
12115.0,Patient,"I know I know I totally understand and I was like a remote program like I get it even more like you're you don't have eyes on me, you know it's hard, but I will say that, like. It least i'm being like honest about maybe like it would be so easy to be like, oh no I didn't do it that day, you know sorry I am being honest about it and, like. I want to get better you know we can help you obviously if."
528.0,Provider,"you're not being honest and and Aside from that, you know I mean I know you're. You know you're really working at this, I can see your efforts, you know and i'm not and I know it's not easy at times and it's you're struggling sometimes but like. You know, so I don't want to like dismiss that even though, like there's some you know, like physically your body needs healing it really does. But mentally I can see, you know behaviorally you're in some you know, in some areas, I see improvement so it's yeah it's all part of the process this yeah."
12115.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean obviously like my body's responding well to the nutrition because, like i'm you know, a malnourished body isn't gonna men straight and i've done that three. spectacular times now so that's a really good sign that you know my body's like oh OK, we can."
528.0,Provider,We can do that yeah absolutely um so we just want to make sure every other partner you is healthy your heart and like. You know that's one of his monitoring your labs are you going to get like do you have an appointment set up for next week for labs because it was supposed to be every other week or do you need to do that.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah I I need to see about that, like I I cannot go down, I need to see if I can get into our hospital, because I cannot, I cannot go down to I mean i'm already leaving work early to come to group and stuff so I don't know. I think I got like a Saturday."
528.0,Provider,I was just gonna say. The other day is better for you.
12115.0,Patient,"Except for I work on Saturdays to. i'm aware of cross country but um let me see what I can figure out I might be able to. See because Saturday I might be want to go to. A later appointment because my meat is early anyway, I don't need to talk through all this with you all see what I can figure out and. I will get back to you on that."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds good okay so you'll work on that you're going to get your week done early next week you'll figure out the ekg and the labs and then what else in terms of the meal plan."
12115.0,Patient,"Oh well, you're going to send. me that again. And then i'm I was going to report to you within 24 hours of behavior and then add 500 calories or you know, make sure i'm getting in that either to 50 to 55."
528.0,Provider,"yeah okay good um. Okay perfect Okay, so now we got to figure out our schedule, because I don't know. If this is going to work every week like I know we did this kind of just for this week. yeah um. I don't know what's. When are you are you saw halina some like crazy our right."
12115.0,Patient,630 in the morning.
