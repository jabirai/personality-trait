323.0,Provider,"The family, helping upstairs family. yeah good."
10611.0,Patient,So you're going you're just taking down like maybe for a minute.
323.0,Provider,Right right absolutely. That works for everybody.
10611.0,Patient,She started classes today she's full time so right now.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, what else I think we talked about this, but what is she going to study."
10611.0,Patient,she's going to wear the shirt.
323.0,Provider,yeah okay. doing it full time what's our. anticipated completion.
10611.0,Patient,"We can afford to pay to get her her old school fees paid off, so we get her credit applies will be the full three and a half years. Okay, so."
323.0,Provider,How much did she do with the old place.
10611.0,Patient,"A couple years. I don't want to believe. It will transfer now see. anything they only tell you what class you took over the phone, so there."
323.0,Provider,wow yeah.
10611.0,Patient,"She she asked to pay your bill and basically they sent her a bill for housing that i'm not even sure would have held up the transcripts and didn't really say it was the only bills that have a couple grand today a couple d'amour and but. With. His medical bills, because the people a job and family services are absolutely useless and don't answer their phones and they never actually like put his insurance through or something like that. just got bills for it."
323.0,Provider,But don't like can to call those places are the hospital or whoever did the medical care and then give them the insurance information. So that they were bullet.
10611.0,Patient,"I, my understanding is that she tried to even get the information from driving family services, I said yeah we'll get it together will give the hospital setting the card, and now that ever happened."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness."
10611.0,Patient,And that would have been two months or more. click on the contact the dmv to.
323.0,Provider,"be right, I know."
10611.0,Patient,We did have a call today today.
323.0,Provider,Nobody really answers the phones anymore. But I would think that they could somehow retro actively submit that to insurance.
10611.0,Patient,Give me a chance. To be able to backdated properly and. We finally figured out.
323.0,Provider,it's still a headache though cuz you gotta still call around and try to get somebody to do something. wow but was her the delivery and everything was covered.
10611.0,Patient,yeah cuz she covered so. let's cover.
323.0,Provider,You would think then they would have like the babies covered them to.
10611.0,Patient,The group number all that stuff.
323.0,Provider,Right.
10611.0,Patient,Given big Quick Start and you will have a little fun starting to smile. Oh sure.
323.0,Provider,yeah.
10611.0,Patient,The cool little bit.
323.0,Provider,wait till they start doing raspberries and all that fun talking back at two I could see so interested in. Looking around everywhere.
10611.0,Patient,"yeah he's he I think he's been having really bad stomach problems all day and we can rectify it he even though they make like sensitive stomach formula, he does not handle. Every time he gets on we probably shouldn't be given to him at night, hope and i'll make them sleep better and just turns into a nightmare where. She takes the breivik work during the days, but still it's just the cost around."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness. Plus it's hard, because then you know they're uncomfortable and there's really not a lot, you can do."
10611.0,Patient,"We we got to the point we're pretty much like to go sleep so we're we're getting now learning. Not rolling on your baby it's like he just will not sleep that you had a bed best, and that was a bit because for a while and. working."
323.0,Provider,Poor guy.
10611.0,Patient,Okay.
323.0,Provider,"And then it's a guessing game just trying to figure out what's going to work, so does he get constipated from the formula."
10611.0,Patient,"Now he just having it just like hurts stomach just cries he times but, like the struggle, the coop but he's for me breastfed coops a couple of times a day. Right, they say. Okay, if they don't prove every day, but you sure. So."
323.0,Provider,So things are moving through.
10611.0,Patient,"I think, like, I think, by we, we think that reflects he doesn't like late as back he doesn't like me until tilted backwards on early stood up and like there's not really a cost. So be like him trying to get something up. I know there's not a whole lot you can do that bring it up to the doctor. Is. not as bad and he looks at now."
323.0,Provider,And maybe it will just grow out of it.
10611.0,Patient,"Hopefully, we have a swing that is great for about 15 minutes at a time, it will stop in the matter what's wrong but it doesn't stop."
323.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know a child that doesn't love the swing there's something about it, I think that just reminds them of the movement that they were in. When they were developing and it just can rack them off to lala land, at least for a little while so you put them in it, you know you got 10 to 15 minutes to run and do something."
10611.0,Patient,"Right. is basically just this battle he's hungry right now is that. We need so for a couple seconds, and then you can tell it's like causing problems to be."
323.0,Provider,"That age now almost two months, does he go monthly to the doctor or how often do they go then for checkups."
10611.0,Patient,I think it was weekly I think yeah now he's. coming off happened yeah.
323.0,Provider,yeah.
10611.0,Patient,Pretty happy healthy baby.
323.0,Provider,yeah he looks like he's gained some good weight.
10611.0,Patient,Oh yeah he he's heavy heavy to carry around.
323.0,Provider,wow. What a cutie oh I can't wait till he's well he's entertaining us a little bit more. So your crew at work and everything's working out no big major stressors.
10611.0,Patient,"No i'm not for the most part, I think my main get a second or third swap out some other people such as this kind of stuff is a little bit I. Think he's afraid of getting next don't think it's an extender to a different division he'll probably four or $5 pain reduction so."
323.0,Provider,Oh boy.
10611.0,Patient,"i'm a little more i'm along or he's just playing. Come they hope i'm going to go ID not stopping a network of a rarely looking at my phone, I am just like. For eight hours a day, every day, very few breaks you struggling to keep up with me a little bit, but. yeah fear though."
323.0,Provider,"How big is what like how many on a team, do you have like now, for some of the jobs you're doing."
10611.0,Patient,"Usually two people sometimes three doing doing we do, unless you have very skilled people that can be left alone, which we do have a couple of those guys. not conducive to take a bunch of guys oh I end up doing is being said number two guys all day so usually to man for us we're ready to go and there's like a heavy lift. grab a young 18 year old that wants to break it back."
323.0,Provider,"And then you see does this like the fall winter season slow down a lot of things, or no."
10611.0,Patient,"yeah yes and no it depends how well the company is about preparing which. they're not we can tell them what to do all day long, so we can work through the manager and they're just so busy they don't want crap so I know it's going to happen is we're gonna hit enter. And they panic, because we can't do we gotta do we didn't prep appropriately so i'm considering taking like two months July employment because it's offered for like January, February. i'm also getting a lot of flack from the company is telling me if I take an appointment and I can't get shot by hours you know I might not get the hours I want. Every."
323.0,Provider,wow.
10611.0,Patient,So it's a pretty tiny I understand why people are willing to split it off on planet never taken it before but it's like five five bucks a week course an extra one ad for every kid you have. A higher but we. know.
323.0,Provider,"So if you don't do that, though, and they put you in the shop or whatever the next thing, what do they actually have you doing then."
10611.0,Patient,"What i'll that's the big thing is we do start well i've done that my whole life i'm so sick of doing it and i'd be more inclined to do it if I didn't live 15 minutes away from my job so it's a 15 minute drive roads are good day to day, so when it's boring i'm. reminder for our time every day to go talk for hours it's not worth it. Right so and then said well you're kind of deleting all the second need to build our time, you can do that, but man is miserable that is not fun when it's 20 degrees or happened, they have the black ground, the money mass you're getting a machine stuck. it's not desirable. So i've been trying to figure something out to do for the winners. For a while now, but the problem is any job that I can get it been worth it it's not even worth me go get a job that pays you know between 12 and 16 bucks an hour that's. Right okay i'm blaming the same way."
323.0,Provider,"You know, in less headache."
10611.0,Patient,"Right and if I were to plow. nice thing is it's like time and a quarter, so it would be like 3435 bucks an hour or something like that which it's just cool, but if you're only getting half hours and. I gotta I have to have an actual discussion with our own and see what he's willing willing to work out with."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10611.0,Patient,"cuz i've been through that like 32 hours a week yeah and then it doesn't snow but it's too cold, the work and all the chef works time man does not work for a whole month of January."
323.0,Provider,And you didn't collect the unemployment on it. Right mm hmm.
10611.0,Patient,"So i've been through that circus before and everybody says the same thing we'll figure it out, I heard that fellas and you will figure it out we'll figure it out, sometimes."
323.0,Provider,Because you've been with them for how long 10.
10611.0,Patient,"Now i've been with them for. Going on a year now, and that was my previous company for a little over four years years and then i've done with my for. Three years of like i've been doing it for seven to nine years. ago my friend patio like. 10 years ago. I worked for big guys so. Good skills to have but that's the."
323.0,Provider,that's always a challenge is the seasonal stuff.
10611.0,Patient,"And I need to maybe consider coming to a different field, but I can use my skills and your table I like what I do but i'm not CAP out at where i'm at i'm at 25 i'm just going to cap it that stretch my body. worth it."
323.0,Provider,Well that's The other thing is the body takes a toll to.
10611.0,Patient,"yeah and i've been steadily gain weight, which is even more, you know more cumbersome and bodies my my back kill everyone just kind of working through the pain, at this point. zero. To 70 gained 60 pounds and I asked you."
323.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's not not something you want to keep carrying around, because then your knees your hips your ankles like everything starts to take a toll to."
10611.0,Patient,go to sleep. go to sleep.
323.0,Provider,Okay i'll listen tonight.
10611.0,Patient,Right and that's the other battles keeping them awake in the day sleep tonight. You know i'm going to be.
323.0,Provider,Right.
10611.0,Patient,I wish I was around more to see and do more stuff. Coming on from work.
323.0,Provider,"Right. it's hard. Just the whole balance, because then when you're exhausted and then their opportunity to raring to go and you don't have the energy for it."
10611.0,Patient,"All right, i'll play a full time taking four times out and take care of the kids. Were. Like yes, I try to pick up the slack on my weekend as much as I can."
323.0,Provider,that's.
10611.0,Patient,still trying to juggle some free time and do their work.
323.0,Provider,"So, with the classes and stuff that she's doing will she does she you guys do have helped for somebody to watch him, while she needs to do some of this stuff."
10611.0,Patient,"And i'm a day. You know it's, not that I can't take him for me. yeah it's it's condensed courses i've taken on the for those there I can that person's work, I think. For every. record."
323.0,Provider,that's that's moving at a fast pace.
10611.0,Patient,"of fast paced is another word for it so like your first class, I mean the kind of stuff that you would expect from a second or third year like the pores. i'm sure she'll she'll be fine, but I was just a lot. Especially with one but. I guess steps rule doesn't stop moving. Right."
323.0,Provider,"Oh wow I mean i've heard of the six in the eight as opposed to a full semester, but for it's."
10611.0,Patient,So she has four classes for weeks apart every. So.
323.0,Provider,that's rugged.
10611.0,Patient,"I guess you know, on the plus side to that is yeah maybe more condensed but you're also not. required to juggle is much because you can put your full focus focus on a class and even if it isn't Kansas, and as those four weeks is up unless you're taken like a second tier quote course of it or whatever. yeah you moving them back."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
10611.0,Patient,"So and she's taking time i'd like to do I just I feel like i'm doing my life don't want can't afford the debt or whatever you know she's getting some help. Technically, a single mothers i'm. sure that that's. Helping for fans and stuff and. He had the script my forms of that work. Is where."
323.0,Provider,"You never know I mean it's never too late to go back, who knows the next job, maybe a little less rugged."
10611.0,Patient,yeah. I need to know and your management position.
323.0,Provider,"that's what I was going to say you're like really growing up the chain that you're ready to like run these projects, not actually be out there and physically doing."
10611.0,Patient,"That that's, the problem is maybe it my own company that is more of a position because they was big companies so small it's I don't see myself being there for a whole lot longer. Think there's room for growth. are asked my daughter, one of the cheapest human being ever in my life everything so so we get into it, or we got into it today it's just it's really tough to do my job, which has been. Employed him. huh so there's a conflict there, but he respects my opinion. A lot of times. it's not good to have the mentality, but she going to do about it. When I can just I can do it and it costs money or time but it's really what's he gonna do."
323.0,Provider,Right.
10611.0,Patient,"I know everyone's replaceable but. I also know I can go get another job, and you can pretty much but i'm making a moment's notice it's tough tough this time of year like fall to spring a little tough but I quit somewhere else i'll have a job next week so i'm not entirely stressed about it."
323.0,Provider,"Well that's what I was gonna say so, the industry what like. Does most of the industry just kind of slow down winter, and so it kind of is you got to make it while you can and spring and summer."
10611.0,Patient,"And it depends Dave states different Florida you do. year round right and you live in Florida, you only have your your complexion rates your soil PSI all that stuff is like, not even a factor, because there's no free thought it's just hot and steady the ground doesn't move. You know I say extreme but ally and then. Like the standard for what we do originated up I think Ontario so I mean it's miserably cold up this."
323.0,Provider,The way.
10611.0,Patient,"They build patty is blake commercial grade for skyscrapers putting in 12 inches a compacted now based on top of impact and soil and do great fabric and stuff that like I know how to do it there's just no necessity to do it here. So, moving a little further south probably helped, but I don't want to move so far South that I am just melting miserable 10 months out of year were you there."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10611.0,Patient,i'm pretty pale burn.
323.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's hard just the the heat in the sun alone would be some added factors. are being outside. Well, it sounds like they'll spring ish time you really need to kind of just shop, the market and see what else is there."
10611.0,Patient,"I usually do usually towards Dan just kind of apply every quarter and talk to people. About stalking and loop, for a long time ever, so people know or do this class people that want to do it or my learn how to do it yeah they see my resume about making sure there's no what his purpose to be around somebody they interact with don't run the job efficiently. know anything with open. People were pretty feel. So it's almost like I need to go and like pretend like i've never done it for like I have a friend that's done this i've learned i've never actually done it."
323.0,Provider,"You would think well you know I mean, I think the industry has changed a lot just in the last couple years with everything that's going on, but you would think the experience. is worth so much more. being paid, you know being paid so much more to run these jobs and come within budget and all that stuff."
10611.0,Patient,"And it's the further up North you go to them i'll tell you so they're willing to pay more to jobs are doing are much more high end stuff but here. I feel like i'm probably caskets I think it was if I work 40 hours a year without missing days or whatever and know, over time, it was like 56 years and I have our is our some 56 but. You know i'm not working full time a couple months out. Right, so it sounds all fine and dandy on paper, but then you actually made every year because not working through a bunch of years. will discourage."
323.0,Provider,And it makes sense. Did he fall asleep.
10611.0,Patient,i'm afraid to move.
323.0,Provider,Well dad's got the touch. Does he is that you know that is that a catnap where he's like out for.

10611.0,Patient,I.
323.0,Provider,Think we've got it straightened out in your chart where it says every other week now so we'll just you just need to kind of keep track of the weeks kind of thing so.
10611.0,Patient,"i'm just starting my day once we turn over 45 minutes of us talk about babies like this, like what was working for me, I like we get a lot i'm just like entirely but. Wait goes pretty smooth she didn't even send me for a drug test assuming she's going here guys is. right under whatever but. Anything pretty much. Like a lot of people they have you that intensive drug testing for the first 90 days or whatever. yeah pretty sure it's pretty high failure rate so it's a second time i've briefs."
323.0,Provider,"Good yeah Dr cell and I were talking will do this, you know these every other week groups and a few more individuals and then we'll reconvene and come up with the discharge and just be ready to get this done. With you so."
10611.0,Patient,With your partner.
323.0,Provider,"All right, well, I hope you have a good evening and a great day tomorrow and i'll see you tomorrow evening."
