252.0,Provider,Are you sleeping.
1977.0,Patient,No i'm driving actually I don't know if you can see.
252.0,Provider,"Oh, there you are. yeah are you."
1977.0,Patient,Ramon Ray. says going through some shit family shit.
252.0,Provider,what's happening.
1977.0,Patient,"Well i've been supporting my daughter and granddaughter the whole time she was pregnant and since the baby's been born or voice doesn't pay for it, anything can like for the House wise. And he makes way more money than I do, and she decided that she wanted to be on her own case for partnership and I just got noticing that I no longer qualify because I make too much money, even though i'm supporting her. and Her husband and her decided to sell the property when my son was living. So while he has nowhere to live."
252.0,Provider,descended just got out of prison.
1977.0,Patient,yeah and he's back in jail already two.
252.0,Provider,For one.
1977.0,Patient,"because somebody that he was hanging out with kept giving them drugs. And he. didn't turn the light off for a minute. Okay, he. went to his ar D plan player my daughter's boyfriend took him and then like. Five minutes after her boyfriend to my apartment my son comes running in the door, and he so they call me and tell me and. next thing I know. they're telling me what happened my phone service calling me, and so I hung up with them and answer this Paul and he tells me that my son has started masturbating in front of the ad Council and then. And I went to my apartment I guess. Because. patel. had to set them up so that his parole officer could pick him up and take them back to jail."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
1977.0,Patient,"and I don't understand why my mom and her husband would do that because, like the whole region there my mom's husband almost died chase was the first time, because he was doing nothing so, and the second time was because he was snorting the pain goes the doctor gave him."
252.0,Provider,Oh no.
1977.0,Patient,"So that she thought in totally disregard that and actually oh he's a changed man and he's so much better than my son, and it really pisses me off, because he wouldn't fucking have any of the health issues that he had. He hadn't been doing either of those things. And I had to take care of her dog both times that she had to be up there, because he was in the hospital it doesn't matter all the stuff that I have done to help them and not it doesn't matter that. They wanted to $200 a month for rent and I was going to be paying that while he was in jail and. it's like why Why are you doing this. we're talking about implementing social security fraud, the only reason he got social security, whereas because. At the time, my mom told so security that they were separated and he was living out the property well my son was staying and she was living at the other house, because they would get you would get a smaller amount by being married and still together. they're not reporting that she never reports any of the income that she gets from any of the people that she loves live with her and it's like you to make on a daily basis and you're pulling this shit. It really makes me want to freakin Turner in."
252.0,Provider,wow.
1977.0,Patient,"My son can't live with me, because I have had, I will either have to go off of hard on. I don't know how I would not freakin like for him on my lease or something, because I can get kicked out for that and with him having to register, it makes it really freaking hard. For him to live in certain areas yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
1977.0,Patient,Oh. It really kinda screwed me with her doing this stuff and they don't care.
252.0,Provider,"It just doesn't make any sense, all of a sudden, you know."
1977.0,Patient,"I know that's why I don't get why all the sudden like first lot like in the middle of last year, they were going to sell the big house and then they decided not to do that because they wouldn't get nowhere near the amount of money that they want. Because of the condition of it so and then oh my mom's husband made the statement well if I can't go out there and enjoy it, because your son lives out there. Why the hell, should we keep it it's like it's only for another year, and what you're going to have three know, three years to have three or something like that, but it's not like it's forever and. it's just frustrating because. She makes these promises to me and then completely frozen. Like box out of it and doesn't even like give me opportunity to try and. find you know how time to actually figure this out. Her yeah and if he doesn't have an address they won't let him out of jail he'll be sitting in jail and the pro."
252.0,Provider,ever.
1977.0,Patient,He froze I.
252.0,Provider,took a.
1977.0,Patient,"Call stops while he's in jail, so if it takes me six months or longer to find a place for him to live, then that extends the whole time you know however long he's locked up, and they won't release him unless he. has an address. So yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Well, how fast do they want him off that property."
1977.0,Patient,"wow. Like I got a huge argument and. i've kind of told my mom my mom to me anymore you let your husband get my face you tell me that this is your guys's home is that I need to get the Fuck out of your guys's home. i'm like the more time you have without man, the more you cut off your family and you treat him and his family, like their goal so you're pretty much dead to me like. If you're going to act like this, and not even work with me or give me timer a thing, and all she could say, is, I will he had his chance and I everybody I have talked to you even his parole officer says people that have mental health issues, it takes them a little longer. Yes, you stick with the program and the less support they have the worst that's gonna fucking be and in her mind Oh well, you know he just he fucked up again, not a problem, she it's like the only person, they can have health issues with her husband."
252.0,Provider,wow Jesus that's horrible so what's the timeline that he has to be off of that property.
1977.0,Patient,"I don't know she didn't give me a date of when everything is going through I keep hearing different stories one person told me that they decided not to sell it another person told me that they're just holding off because. Her mother in law just passed away. right before two days before Christmas or something. So I don't know because I haven't talked to her, since today."
252.0,Provider,wow.
1977.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,And so. You gotta you always got a lot of family stuff going on.
1977.0,Patient,know we. got a break.
252.0,Provider,"I know so. your daughter, and your grandbaby are going to be moving out."
1977.0,Patient,"Well, I got into a huge other with her i'm over the whole partnership thing and told her that I needed to their social security numbers because I was just going to. All partnership myself and see a partnership can change it, without going through social services and the weekend, because I only have one day left in my thyroid both the last time I went off of them is in the hot. More. So."
252.0,Provider,you're breaking up. I can't even hear you. Now you froze.
1977.0,Patient,well.
252.0,Provider,I don't know but a break right back that was cool.
1977.0,Patient,"yeah Thank God. Her boyfriend has not paid any bills at this House whatsoever for her and the baby he doesn't even go buy groceries he's done a package or two of diapers and wipes nothing. And he makes more money than I do, and get this he doesn't even frickin have any money fucking save a place for them to move into where the hell is all of his money young."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
1977.0,Patient,"I mean, he makes like 24 or 2021 to $24 an hour. that's really more monies learning. You know most. knows more than I make. How can I say, but he can't I don't get it and I told her that she should let me claim her in the baby on taxes, this year, since I supported them and she got pissed off and said no her boyfriend is i'm like he's not going to give you any of that money this year."
252.0,Provider,You should be able to claim. All three of them.
1977.0,Patient,"He didn't know he doesn't work with me he knows the sisters in the same apartment complex. Okay, when he was asked, one of the reasons I told her he couldn't be here anymore, because he wouldn't fuckin help with anything nothing he would literally let everything gets shut off and her suffer."
252.0,Provider,me.
1977.0,Patient,"fucking. He does not get it, she thinks that if they get their own place that he's magically going to be different."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
1977.0,Patient,"If he's not doing it now, why would you think that it would fucking change and they actually thought they were getting it a place that apart these apartments are like. To. be like. This tree. From my mom's house and then one street over through a personalized see the apartment complex from my mom's house and then. After she they said she qualified or something she went to go do some other paperwork and then all of a sudden, they said oh you guys don't have enough income they wanted three times the rent and they just raised the rent from like 595 to 1000 bucks. i'm like well and then she tells me they don't qualify for hug because he makes too much money i'm like So what are you going to do this here, the best thing would have been for you to fucking stay here and his dumb ass to be saving money."
252.0,Provider,And then.
1977.0,Patient,"could actually like put a down payment on a house to buy it. He does not want to fucking work with anybody at all. Well hey it's fucking sister money that are you fucking kidding me he was literally paying $300 or $400. A month to store his shit over there and we're staying over here. What an eight here half the time you would shower here half the time you would go over there and shower all his clothes were over there, except for whatever he was worried. That he stayed here. I don't get it and. An eye opener her, there is no talking any. sense into her anything."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
1977.0,Patient,"Well, at this point, know if she moves out with him well she packed a bunch of crap moneymen a bunch a bunch of the baby stuff and took it over to the sisters house. And let's all her other shit in the room here when she said i'm packing my shit and I come and look and all she took was a baby. So she's passing out."
252.0,Provider,There right now.
1977.0,Patient,"wow cuz I fucking got pissed and was like you know what i'm sick of helping humans here you are so you guys are being so fucking selfish I I just kind of medical because of you, I can't file taxes and claim you because you don't want me to when I know i'm doing everything for you. So if you move out and you end up with nothing because of him. Then. it's kind of been like."
252.0,Provider,I told you so yeah.
1977.0,Patient,"and Really haven't talked much sense, because I was so mad and told you got two weeks to get out of my house i'm not going to take care of you anymore. and his sister don't why you stay over there and I guess you're sleeping your fucking car with your baby, because this is bullshit I never wanted to be that parent and I never had all my kids I never thought in the to would be the one. To be like this."
252.0,Provider,it's understandable.
1977.0,Patient,"So, but i'm. pushing through. And I had five days off of work today was my first day back because my coworker before my two days off of work last week um. Well right when I went off for my two days off I get a text from her on my second day off of saying that she was positive for coven and that I should go get tested because i'm not vaccinated. So I got a home test that one came up negative, but I didn't feel good at all that day like I literally slept all day. Like all the rest of that day I had court Monday and then I came home, I was gonna watch a movie with my daughter, and I lay down and I couldn't I. was asleep and I woke up at like eight or nine o'clock that night went to the bathroom and went right back to sleep I just didn't build it and just. couldn't stay awake so I thought, well, maybe I do I have it, but the test came back negative and then my boss tells me he goes i'm not gonna say I have to go to the clinic and get an actual have one there. Did you follow. yeah I spent money for the home has for nothing because she wouldn't accept it and, if I can go with death came back negative. So why i've got to try and make up the money that. not working."
252.0,Provider,No my God. If it isn't one thing is always something else.
1977.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,I think you're doing the right thing with your daughter.
1977.0,Patient,Thank you.
252.0,Provider,It sucks.
1977.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"It really does, but you know you're right you're in you're justified. you're the you're the old faithful you're going to be there, no matter what right your mom. There should be some given take there. So I get it. Big time. You know so we're going to do, why did you get kicked off a medical."
1977.0,Patient,"Because they said I make too much money I don't know I don't know how what because the paper said something about making 20 $600 a month. 20 $600 a month what's the help and the worker never called us back when we call last week, so I haven't really been able to look into it, but."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
1977.0,Patient,"my headphones can you hear me. yeah Okay, I want to make sure that it didn't just like mess up the volume stuff because my headphone died."
252.0,Provider,No.
1977.0,Patient,"So yeah i'm. still hanging in there and I haven't got to see my son that's in jail since Christmas, because everything that's been going on and they moved him. Tanks two different times now, so the day is probably changed it was perfect because I could go on my lunch breaks and see him on Thursday and. Saturday, and then I had Sunday off, so it didn't matter what days are what time Sunday, but now they switch my days off back to Monday, Tuesday, so um I don't know if i'm going to get to visit."
252.0,Provider,And this is your younger son just got out of prison.
1977.0,Patient,Actually he's the oldest.
252.0,Provider,Oh okay.
1977.0,Patient,"yeah but yeah he did the one that just got out of prison yeah. And he's freaking social up and scared because. He doesn't want to be stuck in jail for however long it takes to find somewhere for him to live. Right and because of this sex charge. And there's a lot of programs that he doesn't qualify for. yeah like a mental health will pay for hotel rooms for homeless people, but not if you're a registered sex offender. yeah it does oh. yeah so, even though I feel like the lawyer did a fucked up job on that whole situation because the lawyer even said, we can one this case, but instead of telling him don't take this deal you're gonna win. He like Well, this is the only offer there is, and it was get out no probation know, basically, the only thing he had to do is register as a sex offender. And the lawyer even even told him, it was only going to be for 10 years and lied about that too, and there is like I don't have money to go find a different lawyer to i'm. Trying to. fix that. yeah so it's like what can I do."
252.0,Provider,"And this will eliminate because you were telling me a story about he was at him to went into his substance abuse counselor and. showed him, you know."
1977.0,Patient,"The idea that just happened right before he went to jail, but they didn't press charges for that Thank God. But what he actually got the sex charge for was when he was first diagnosed with issues and they sent him home from the mental hospital that he was in for only 10 days. And he they sent him with a paper prescription I couldn't get the prescription that the day that he got back because it was a holiday, so I had to wait and then, when I did get it, it was like. almost like him not taking those meds for just a day and a half really like made him go back to like like not being on them at all. So he was all out of it, and when I got the meds he refused to take him and ran off and then ended up taking a bike ride with one of his friends and. Instead of the friend not taking him to a public place they stopped to walgreens to get something to drink my son was asked to stay outside, with the bikes. was out there for a minute and then went running in the store started knocking stuff off the shelves just acting like a total jackass and then. One of the female workers, said something to him and he said oh you're fine bitch I want to Fuck you and grabbed her breasts and that's what got him the sexual battery charge. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"wow I just it's amazing to me how it spirals to this point, you know. It really does tiffany I mean."
1977.0,Patient,"it's so frustrating, but you know I can only do so much."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
1977.0,Patient,i'm not wonder woman. i'm trying the best that I can. You know when things are out of my control and in other people's hands there's not much I can do.
252.0,Provider,wow. really true. You know.
1977.0,Patient,So i've just been taking it one day at a time.
252.0,Provider,How are things with you and your boyfriend.
1977.0,Patient,"on and off still because. I have some insecurities with things that he does sometimes and he still doesn't have a job, but he just. won his appeal for because he filed for unemployment when coven first hit and got all that got like $11,000 blew it on absolutely nothing has nothing to show for it. And just won the appeal to get the other part, that when they stopped in it and so he just got $7,000 and it's like. Here I am struggling, you can see that, like i'm upset and not know about my meds like you can offer to pay for them, or something. And you're not so it frustrates me like you got this lump sum of money for doing fucking nothing and i'm working my ass off actually paying for everything and it pisses me off, that I get to watch you just go fucking float on the casino or whatever the Fuck you want to go home. Is bullshit that's not building a future for us, Brian and I like i've told him it, this is not. The life that you want to build then just get out of my life because I want to be in a relationship where we're actually partners. And he can't live with me because of all the shit that he already did we live with me here before, so if we ever want to live together again we have to move. i'm not going to fucking do that. and be screwed and be stuck paying for everything somewhere else he's got a fucking get a job. And that's been a. never ending battle Oh, and also my mom got him to do this renters bullshit so that she can get a bunch of money because he hasn't been paying rent and so it's like a renters relief thing. yeah and your tents can't pay or whatever. yeah so she only asked him to give her 3000 and he's supposed to be getting $8,000 so there's another $5,000 he gets to do whatever with and it's like. I should be the one fucking doing this shit. But. Like the few times that I asked for the information from either of them, they just blew me off. And it wasn't until I got into a huge argument with him, just like a few days ago that he finally wrote the information down on how to look the Info up and it pisses me off it's like. All the shit that i've done for you, like you, won't even be fucking living out my mom's property if I hadn't begged for her and it's caused so many. Problems between my mom and I am between you and I, because you weren't follow any fucking rules and you still just don't feel obligated to fucking compensate me in any way. nope. To his time. He gave me $500 well first he was going to give me 1000 then he took the money back and gave me 500 instead."
252.0,Provider,He has that much or something.
1977.0,Patient,"Because and hit, because in his eyes he's giving he's giving me $1,000 to give me $1,000 when he got the 11,000. The first time and that was to pay me for all the money that I had loaned him that didn't include like all the rent that I paid and all the utilities when he lived with me for a year and a half, but. Okay, whatever then he gave me $1,000 when he got the money from getting hit by the car on his bicycle for picking him up from San Francisco because I spent like $1,000 on that trip alone and he's like I just don't see how you spend $1,000. i'm like shit adds up real quick, especially when gas is like over $5 a gallon Brian."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
1977.0,Patient,"And not only that, but this is the one time that I did something that took me kind of takes you back to your old life but. A friend of mine was really desperate because she had some money problems and had some pain pills, and I knew he was going to be in a lot of pain. And they only gave him like 20 pills and you're all of the show with his hands, so I bought some of the pills for him, he doesn't remember that they're not cheap. Oh wow yeah but I said i'll never do that again because you didn't appreciate it, for one, and for to you keep telling me that. there's no way I could have spent $1,000 on that trip and all the shit I paid for, for you, I bought all these whole bunch of medical supplies to because they send him home with basically like a day and a half worth of dressing to change his will. Because they thought. yeah they thought that he was supposed to get home health coming in, but because he can walk home health would not come in so basically we were stuck taking care of it ourselves. And that stuff was not cheap either, and he doesn't think about those things. So. he's got like a very short amount of time to make some sort of improvement with what he wants to do with his life, otherwise i'm just gonna fucking tell him i'm done because i'm sick of this shit. i'm sick of watching. him get to do whatever he wants spend money on stupid shit while i'm sitting here actually being responsible."
252.0,Provider,"And struggling. You know. it's sad because the message is you know you make more money, if you do nothing yeah yeah no."
1977.0,Patient,"yeah it really does. But the good thing is friggin i'm still keeping up with my sobriety, no matter what, because I know that if I go backwards i'm going to end up with nothing. i'm not gonna be one of those people that is so lucky that gets free money in a free place to stay and somebody taking care of me, so I know I can't go backwards. But sometimes, let me tell you, watching some of the people that i've seen a male it really makes me feel like well Fuck I might as well just be goby friggin broken homeless and then i'll just get a bunch of money somehow."
252.0,Provider,"Because they're handing it out, if you need. If you really need it. I get it."
1977.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's frustrating, but I joke about that, but i'm not going to ever do that because, then I won't ever be stable for my son and with dealing with somebody that has mental health issues it's not just a one week thing or a month thing it's forever and. I am not gonna be that parent like my my mom tells me, you need to just make him grow up he's an adult he needs to figure out himself and I can't do that because people with mental health issues need help."
252.0,Provider,"um it'd be different if you didn't have mental health issues, but he does, which really kind of hinders his growth in the responsible state, you know the responsibility area, you know he's got limits, because of that."
1977.0,Patient,I don't understand she says that this is the things that her counselor is telling her and i'm like are you not giving the full story because i've never had a counselor say. anything about oh just let them deal with it on their own if they have mental health issues.
252.0,Provider,No.
1977.0,Patient,I don't get it like Where are you getting your information from.
252.0,Provider,yeah and um I would question you know.
1977.0,Patient,"I thought to i'm like that doesn't seem right, and you know. But."
252.0,Provider,I don't know.
1977.0,Patient,"i'm not gonna argue with her over my choices it's my decision she can't force me to not be there for my son. i'm not gonna be like you and. Just forget all the other fucking people in my family just because I have a man or I want a different life i'm gonna do what I can to help them grow into the people that they should be, and that doesn't mean it's going to be easy or a very quick thing but i'm not just gonna give up. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"I do know. And there's nothing wrong with helping people there's absolutely nothing wrong with it, as long as you're taking care of yours and your needs are met first."
1977.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean it's not like i'm like taking so much away from myself to do anything for him is just the fact. That she's taking away what she offered in the first place, and that this isn't y'all but if that's what she's gonna do whatever and I, you know, at some point it's gonna catch up to you mom if you keep doing things fraudulently you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah it does it catches up that's for sure.
1977.0,Patient,"But I don't know she's gotten away with doing things. A lot of times and getting a lot of help that she probably didn't deserve to get because. When you get help if you, especially if you're a sane person and you don't have mental health issues. If you keep doing the same shit over and over again, like not paying your bills and then. Either being on the verge of being shut off or getting shut off and putting it in someone else's name, because you can't get it back on and your name, because the bills do I then at some point, you know people should stop healthy. But somehow she managed to continue to get help from people Whenever she you know can't afford to pay for things and it's ridiculous I just don't understand it."
252.0,Provider,I get it.
1977.0,Patient,"But On another note she's gonna have some other freakin things to deal with because her husband's cousin that is mentally disabled that they offer to let move in and take care of and be the pay for um has been has gotten involved with the regional Center here to get. Like a worker that comes in and takes him to go shopping and takes him to pay bills or not pay bills, but to go to appointments or whatever takes him to go to school, because he never finished high school well. he's been telling this end his mental health counselor some of the things that my mom's husband has been saying to him, you cannot tell somebody that. You have to be there payee as long as they live with you there's nowhere enough in anything that says that you absolutely have to be there, he if he wants the regional Center to be his fucking baby instead of you guys he has that right to frickin do that. and threatening. and threatening to kick him out if he changes pay, he is absolutely freaking against the law so he they're going to be having to talk to frickin adult protective services soon, because of that, because you can't do that shit. No, and not only that, but they freakin told him, he can live at the their big house with them and they got tired of not having a break, because Yes, he can be very overbearing and. can call a million times and ask for a million different things, but that's the job you took on you can't just go take him out and drop them off in a freakin trailer. and expect him to be able to take care of himself that's not what that's not why he moved here that's wrong, and not only that, but. you're still claiming to so security that he lives in that house with you it's it's like. You can't do this shit."
252.0,Provider,wow.
1977.0,Patient,"I like talking to my aunt a one point, it was like so mad and was like I want to turn her in for everything that she's doing wrong, am I am like don't do that because. Then, something bad's gonna happen to you and i'm like Okay, whatever and I never talked to anybody or turn them in or anything and they already got this whole APS bullshit on their own, because their own stuff so i'm just kind of sitting back waiting to see you know. yeah well happy. I was at that point, because I was sick of it's like Oh, let me use you and then, when I don't need you i'm we're just going to cut everything off. that's why going to that that's horrible. yeah it does feel horrible because, when my mom's husband was in the hospital both times, he almost died all she could say was she just wished that he would go so she wouldn't have to deal with all of this. mm hmm and. What, five, six months after he is out of the hospital and somewhat okay and able to do things oh now oh they're back together and. Making all these plans together, I don't get it, how can you forgive him and so easily, but your grandchild that you've been in his life his whole entire life, you can just cut off like that."
252.0,Provider,"Right, especially the options are limited, you know."
1977.0,Patient,"yeah yeah exactly. And she would never do this to her husband, she would never freakin just kick him out like she's doing my son I don't I don't understand it. And like my brother is still lives at the House over there with them and nothing's ever said about him he doesn't have to move out or grow the Fuck up and stop selling weed on the side, he gets to just still do whatever he wants."
252.0,Provider,wow.
1977.0,Patient,"yeah it's irritating but I can't dwell on it, because then it just makes I just make myself sick, I have to think about the things that I can do, and the emotions that I can keep going. that's what i've been doing. talking to a couple good friends and venting to them and getting support and. I did reach out to you a couple of."
252.0,Provider,You did and then. I get a message from Dr bros and she was worried about yeah.
1977.0,Patient,"yeah I got punched in the face the last right before the last group that I had because my daughters have sister had been staying here which. I guess my daughter didn't even know she was coming to town, and neither one of us actually said she could just move in here, but she kind of just came and stayed and then never left well a couple of things of mine came up missing, and I saw her with. The same item but she said it was hers and i'm like how, how is that yours, like my shits missing, and then you have the same thing. And so I got a set and I told her to leave my room and then next I have my grandson at this time to next thing I know she's yelling up my grandson or you think you can break my shit you think it's Okay, a fucking break my shit I was like upon. Your 17 year old talking to a five year old that doesn't understand why you're saying that has like autism or something I can't remember what his grandma says he has to anyways he's like not like a normal five year old. You can't actually have like a full blown conversation with him because he doesn't understand, so I went out there and. grabbed him by the hand and said, you need to come and grandmas room, we need to have a talk. And I sat him down, and I said okay junior you have these are your toys you can't touch other people's stuff honey. If it's not yours, you need to ask okay grandma and said, you need to go tell her you're sorry. Bobby i'd made him stay in here at furman and I went into my daughter's room and i'm like I want you to take her and go for a drive. I need her to leave the House now because i've That was the last straw the way she talked to junior after sitting here lying about stealing my shit I just she's leave for a little while. And so I go back to my room I hear my daughter say something to her and she's like Fuck that i'm not fucking leaving i'll call my real sister aaliyah i'll have her come get me and so she's out there mouth and off stupid shit and so. I stayed in the room, with junior until I heard her say I don't even know why the Fuck your mom is accusing me of stealing shit again and I was floored I fucking walked out there and I was like you know what you need to get out of my house now. And she refused i'm getting my stuff and she's literally, this is what she's doing she's literally. Picking up one item at a time and putting it in a fucking back purposely just to piss me off, more so I grabbed the fucking bad from the cider and took that. side, and then I took her bong and I took it even like halfway to the road, because I knew that was the one the most important things to her and then. She said when leave my house, even though all of her items were not in my house anymore, now the story is she has to stay until his. sister gets here i'm like you can stay outside, and she still wants so i'm like I put my hands out like this and i'm trying to like corral her to the door and she frickin punches me in the back. my daughter my daughter gets in between us and then next thing you know, like two seconds later here comes the sister just barges in my house and all the sudden. The to his house that my daughters have sister her name is unique olson unique all the tears are coming down oh shimmy shimmy I didn't fucking touch her. And so the sister that you know came to get her her name is alia alia start screaming don't touch my sister i'll beat your ass. And my daughters like she didn't touch her what are you talking about you need sitting here lying my mom didn't touch her she's asked her to get out of her house. And so unique like where's my ball and i'm like it's out there by the road. And so, she goes out the door first and then uh we're starting to step out the door, but keep one foot inside my house, and so I start to shut the door, because I thought she was gonna go ahead and step the rest of out. But yeah so then she pushes my door back and she's like i'm fucking china's the and she's getting there. And i'm like she has over stuff you need to go and then she frickin push the door again and then just then my daughter's behind me. And my grandson's trying to get in between us, so my daughter's friend comes and grabs my grandson and then my daughter sees her step sister Leah COP back and she punched me in the eye twice before we get the door shut."
252.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
1977.0,Patient,"So I was really upset and chicken up because I didn't deserve that I didn't do anything for confronting someone for stealing from me after i've let you stay in my fucking house. yeah that's it you're done, you know leave don't kind of ever come back."
252.0,Provider,And so that's.
1977.0,Patient,"Probably why she was worried about me because I was like. No, I didn't I wasn't trying to like be in a panic attack, but talking about it just made me so overwhelmed and upset because I did the right thing by not hitting either one of them, when I shut up, I felt like I should have just fucking. You know knock some sense into both of them, but i'm the better person and try to do it the civil way, and of course they're gonna fight that."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God. But she's done now."
1977.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,Did you get did you have a black guy.
1977.0,Patient,"i'm just a a faint one but it's it's like hook for a lot longer than I thought it would I didn't like get really black and purple it was just slightly like greenish. been hurt like right here, still hurts just a little bit. yeah and it's been two weeks. or three weeks something like that."
252.0,Provider,She bruised and inside pretty good.
1977.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"And you know, honestly, you did do the right thing. And it sucks right. But. You don't have I told my daughter and."
1977.0,Patient,"I told my daughter you're not letting anybody stay in my fucking House again I don't care I don't care if it's your friends, I don't care they can come for a few hours. and leave because even the friend that was here that grabbed my grandson wouldn't stick up for me and say tiffany didn't touch her, she just sat there was she was watching the whole fucking thing go down, and she saw that I didn't hit her or touch her. So after that I just told you tonight, no, no more friends stay in the night, no, no i'm done."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
1977.0,Patient,"They can go fucking stay at your House, when you get one. When you get one deal with this shit."
252.0,Provider,Right.
1977.0,Patient,"I worked my ass off when I come home I shouldn't have to go Oh, I have to lock my frickin door every time I leave because somebody's going to go in my room and steal shit."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm he right.
1977.0,Patient,"And she shouldn't want people around that are doing that. No, but thankfully after all of that she said that they're not her freakin sister she don't want nothing to do with them and, as far as I know, she's said she hasn't spoke to either of them at all. And the thing that sucks, though, is all her dad can say is i'm sorry that happened honey you didn't deserve that and. hasn't talked to her sense. yeah goes from one her to come over every couple of days to have dinner or lunch or breakfast with him to just not talking to her, because since that happened I don't know if it's because of that, or what but. Pretty shitty."
252.0,Provider,wow yeah. That is finished up.
1977.0,Patient,So she like whatever I don't need him either.
252.0,Provider,wow.
1977.0,Patient,"yeah and it's sad because literally they were finally starting to like build a relationship, because they never really had one. He wasn't ever allowed to have her unless his baby mama at the time, the one that he had all the other kids with. She had to go she had to be the one to come get our daughter he could never come get her he could never fucking go by her anything. So there is like restrictions on the type of relationship, they can have until he broke up with that girl and started just. Doing shit but for himself and then finally started like talking to her more and then, when she found out she was pregnant he really started. Trying to be there more and then after the baby was born like I was blown away at how like how much he was trying to be involved with her until all this shit happen."
252.0,Provider,wow yeah and you never know what they went back and told him.
1977.0,Patient,mm hmm. hmm.
252.0,Provider,So I hope you find that out at some point.
1977.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"The truth, you know."
1977.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,God tiffany.
1977.0,Patient,And the sad thing is supposedly oh yeah he proposed to his new girlfriend that he's only been with for like six months or something. On Christmas. And now they're moving and they're moving to Vegas so she doesn't have a lot of time to even spend time with them because they're moving.
252.0,Provider,wow.
1977.0,Patient,But at the same time. Hopefully she'll see this as an eye opener and think about how he's acting towards her as her father and how her boyfriend is being with their daughter because basically all he does is go to work and come home and sleep he very rarely takes care of their daughter.
252.0,Provider,wow.
1977.0,Patient,She has maybe 24 seven.
252.0,Provider,Unbelievable but that's what he's allowed to get away with that's what he'll do.
1977.0,Patient,"And that's that's some she's got to deal with, but I just hope that she realizes what's going on, it sooner than later, as I told her your it's gonna be a lot harder, if you wait 510 years down the road before you get fed up with the shit. And do something about it it's gonna be a lot harder yeah. But. Is her decision."
252.0,Provider,"Well she'll figure it out, you know. And you'll be able to walk her through it and tell her, I told you so. You know that's one thing that I know is that kids they have to go down their own path they have to walk their own you know road. The other we try to warn them and get them to stop and do things differently it doesn't work they still better figure it out on their own."
1977.0,Patient,"are watching it's hard watching her, though, because growing up, she had so much delays that she. needed help with and guidance like she did never understood red fives of like oh don't don't don't don't go talk to strangers she it didn't matter how many times, I told her, she would still just run up to talk to whoever and it makes me worried with her baby because. Is she gonna know all these things, or is she just going to kind of do whatever you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
1977.0,Patient,The only thing I can do is be there if something happens I guess.
252.0,Provider,"that's right, I mean obviously they get to a point where they don't want to listen to you anymore anyways. man."
1977.0,Patient,"I really thought. She went and stayed with her sister for two weeks because. At that point, she was kind of fed up with her boyfriend pulling the shit that he was pulling and. Then all of a sudden, she came back in it was like she wasn't even gone she just. went straight to fucking having him come over again i'm just like, why did you even like go up there and stay gone for two weeks and not be around him. When all they did was give him more time to fucking play and then allow him to just continue doing what he's doing I didn't make sense to me but that's her decision."
252.0,Provider,wow. wow that's a lot.
1977.0,Patient,yeah it is.
252.0,Provider,"Well, listen, let me make. Our next appointment. Okay okay. let's have it set in stone already so that this doesn't."
