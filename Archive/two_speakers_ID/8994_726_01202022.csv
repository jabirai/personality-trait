So last night. i'm at the stone House just trying to you know unwind and relax and like kind of just get out in public and get like that on beyond that, like energy from other people around me and he ends up texting me. He wants to stuff. And i'm like yeah no worries, you know and like here I go like being super loving. You know, I was worried sick about you, is everything okay uh you know and then it's like so to make the cut the long story short, here, you know he he is in cahoots with the with Stephen the married. and For me, I just it was just another one it was just another thing for him to throw in my face to try to hurt me with. And now i'm like you know, like like he did it on purpose, you know and it's like here, I was I opened my fucking home to you okay I donated money to your fucking Fund money that I didn't have to get your fucking dog home from China. Okay, I bought food I bought him toiletries justin got on his feet. they're loving and supporting him, you know, and my whole thing is is I didn't really okay like yes i'm may or may not be misguided here, but his married friend pursued the shit out of me. Okay, two to tango here they both knew that I was super vulnerable. yeah a and. Like I treated them so good. I didn't do anything wrong."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
8994.0,Patient,"Sorry, if loving somebody. And being good to them. is wrong, you know. yeah, but I feel like and more these days it's like people use a fucking sledge hammer on a thumbtack.

Okay. I. You know, look, and I even I even opened up, and I said something to him, like look I have ptsd I have a lot of stuff going on with me right now, and sometimes hurt people hurt people okay it's like I didn't mean to hurt you, it was like a neat reaction. But you just you know you just at the one slight drop of a hat you just took off, you know I didn't think that you were going to take that letter but you. yeah and then he's like Oh, but you threw me out, and this is going back like fucking six or seven years ago Okay, this is how."
726.0,Provider,Oh wow.
8994.0,Patient,"Okay, so, six, seven years ago when justin was 24 he you know we opened our House to him Okay, and he promises shit he you know, he was going to give us money he gets a job he doesn't even give us fucking rent money Okay, and it wasn't just me, it was my roommate that threw him out. Okay, my."
726.0,Provider,"roommate the i'm sorry, is it the image that you live with now from. The same person from six seven years ago."

The person that owns this House. she's the one. That was like got on my case, and then we had to throw them out Okay, he goes moves in with some other chicks okay and given him rent them rent money. Okay, they take his fucking door off of his room they throw him out they call the COPs on him Okay, and he is homeless again and where does he come here. Okay, we opened up our House again. yeah and at that time he ended up getting arrested because he did it didn't have car insurance was driving around no insurance, no, no registration blah blah blah blah blah. And I Okay, so he ended up getting caught he went to jail for five days Okay, and when he came, you know, out of jail, you know he moved back in here, and you know that's when his best friend who whom already moved to China. was like you know, so I had like sent him a plane ticket to go to China Okay, so I, being a great friend and helping him i'm sorry my ears like called. me being a great friend, that I am I helped him get to China. Okay, I gave him suitcases I got him his passport, I mean I fuckin helped his ass. Okay, on my dime in my time and my whole point is, is he goes to China meets up with Stephen that's the married guy okay yeah and Stephen gets caught with a three grams of pot and goes and gets locked up in China goes to jail for three fucking years gets expedited home last year for. us so justin okay was never going to stay in China for five years.

But the thing is is for what reason."
726.0,Provider,"All I mean you've treated him very well and i'm thinking like if if he feels. In a way, yes, he has not treated me well, but also Secondly, he knows a huge treat him, while I wonder if there's a fear of losing you as a friend, because you have been a good friend and."
8994.0,Patient,He already did.
726.0,Provider,"So that's what i'm thinking, the reason may be that he's been trying to contact you he's looking he's grasping at straws for anything that he can get back in you know contact with you, whether it's good or bad, just to be in contact with him so."
8994.0,Patient,"And you know so last night um you know, I was just sick of it, you know so because I don't want to get played here all right. yeah I don't want him sleeping in his car either she hasn't met so I end up calling his mom. yeah Okay, and I love his mom his mom was like Fuck him he's being an asshole he's burning bridges Jay i'm sorry.

My cats wake me up around like four in the morning to get out of the room and feed them. i'm starting to fall back asleep, and I can just feel it in my lungs this feeling of my poor body is depressed I can't personally feel it, but I could feel that in my lungs and last time that I felt like this was when I was 15. My mom was being so abusive to me girl like I remember, she would drive me to school and this one time she is arguing with me, she punched me in the face Okay, and so I go to get out of the car at a red light, and she rips my fucking shirt off. I go running into school in a bra. And it's so it's around this time Okay, where I am so stressed out i'm so depressed as a teenager this is right before she abandoned me in a third world country, mind you, I ended up getting so sick with bronchitis or pneumonia for months I can't even I mean every step, I take i'm like. Because of the depression of the stress of the grief that feeling."
726.0,Provider,"You know, is."
8994.0,Patient,"manifested into this bronchitis or pneumonia that I had almost a year and a half, almost two years she. She abandoned me in a third world country with bronchitis or pneumonia. When I was sick and you know it's like stocks is so i'm in the facility okay and they're Jamaican and I love them and every single one of those women that were like the caregivers the nurse the. Mother the House mothers, they used to call them. They all took one look at me and was like they were so upset how on earth. Could a mother abandoned their child. that's sick. You know, and so i'm I have this feeling okay. Where because i'm so detached from because i'm in shock, you know, and I mean where I just feel like that grief that like pressure in my lungs and i'm like I just fall i'm falling asleep just being like my poor body my poor baby. My poor baby you don't deserve this you don't deserve to feel like this and and it's like everything all the odds are stacked against me. People treat me like shit. I mean I am abused by different people on a fucking daily basis girl. And you know what every day I wake up happy. Every day I wake up and i'm like today, is going to be a good day i'm going to try my best. Every day we've got. Every day, I try my best. and So I wake up, you know to my alarm right. And i'm in a good mood. Because in in my heart of hearts, I feel like. So much shit is is the odds are always against like an in a big way at this point. And i'm like you know what. Usually its darkest before the dawn and like now, that all of this shit is like I couldn't I there could be like, I mean the whole world's against me I feel like and that's when I had this like faithful heart where i'm like you know what. The reason why it looks like this right now is because something good is going to happen, a blessing a miracle some like. Like maybe God is pushing all of these people out of my life. And yeah these obstacles have to where it's like oh my God it's like seems like mount Everest so he can show out in my life."
726.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and what happened after. When your mom did your mom have addiction issues like or she just had mental health issues that."
8994.0,Patient,"She has that abusive so yeah she has OK, so my mom has an untreated mental illness. And that not it's not hereditary it's in utero when my grandmother was five months pregnant with my mom. A pipe burst and hit her in the stomach and she thought she was going to lose my mom. And although. there's a developmental problem there."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, I see okay okay."
8994.0,Patient,"um and she is very sociopathic. She doesn't experience love or feelings like normal people. she's very vicious at times but she's very good at like pretending to be the sweet innocent person. it's. it's hard you know because there's a part in my heart that like. I want to believe so bad that she is. This good innocent person. But then, all she does is abuse me. And i'm at the point in my life, I think I was telling you last week I can't have her in my life."
726.0,Provider,"yeah she's going to ask you when was the last time, what is your communication with your arm your parents, if there is any at all."
8994.0,Patient,"Well, my dad is passed away. he's done. My mom and. I. She is one of these people that like she like stocks me almost. So her and my aunt Jo Jo we're calling my other phone or whatever in September and then she tried to call and around Christmas time and i'm done. i'm done because I can't have, for in my life, because then, what happens is I attract. I can't separate her. The way he treats me from the other one my life, and I feel like that is what is coming at me right now is. All of these unhealthy relationships that have that I gravitated towards me because I had an open relationship with her, and I am like at the point like I can't have I can't. I can't discern healthy people and healthy relationships, because there's a level of tolerance of abuse that I have to deal with with my mom when I am you know in contact with her. What."
726.0,Provider,i'm sorry go ahead i'm sorry interrupted you.
8994.0,Patient,"Know it's okay like I have like so because I have to accept this level of abuse from her and have this tolerance, I accept a level of abuse and I have tolerance for other people. And that's why my ex boyfriend last year beat the shit out of me Okay, because I was having relationship with my mom and unfortunately it trickles in into all of my life and talks defies it and i'm really trying so hard to. cleanse this it's hard, because I live with somebody who's passive aggressive way abusive to me my Ashley you know and it's like I just feel like i'm so tired of being in a fucking abusive situation."
726.0,Provider,"So I would ask my question then is what's your definition of abuse, because the word of use is pretty heavy so in in a general sense if we're saying everybody's abusive well where who is it and what what is it that makes it. A beam service as opposed to be need or just being an angel."
8994.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
726.0,Provider,You know.
8994.0,Patient,I think I think we'll start with justin. Being abusive.
726.0,Provider,yeah okay.
8994.0,Patient,amy being very. aggressive towards me. calling me a horse.
726.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
8994.0,Patient,"Okay, and then there's Ashley Okay, who is passive aggressively abusive okay or. it's like how do I explain this it's like a level of disapproval."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
8994.0,Patient,Okay it's like a like a oh you can't even support yourself.
726.0,Provider,judgmental.
8994.0,Patient,"it's like you know she'll sit there and see me struggling and be like that's all help you. Like she doesn't like it's there's she's she also has a mental illness untreated see how I can gravitate these people towards me she has trichotillomania. Okay, and she's not in the phase where she's plucking out her eyelashes or hair Okay, but the other side of that is emotional detachment meaning I haven't seen this girl smile she talks to people like shit and she doesn't even see it okay it's it's very weird to me it's like. A chip on her shoulder like i'm just tired, I feel like she treats me like i'm a fucking peasant."
726.0,Provider,How long have you been living with her.
8994.0,Patient,"Since 2013. Okay, look if I I would love to get the Fuck out there if I. Could I would I don't know how I don't make enough money. i'm kind of stuck. In a pretty shitty situation. And every day I wake up happy every day I try my best, I do what I can. All I can do is try my best and i'm trying. I don't make enough money. I work my ass off. The economy sucks right now. I can't afford 1800 dollars. Plus utility yeah oh okay i'm really at this point i'm up against the rock and a hard place and it really does seem bleak, at times, but I tried not to dwell in there, I just try to really. You know I just have faith i'm fucking idiot okay I literally just have this like. it's toxic optimistic faith, I am it's it's so optimistic, like every day i'm like something's gonna something goods gonna happen, things will fall into place, I you know. I mean, and the thing is, I guess that's what keeps me going. Because what's the other side of that waking up I wish I was done like uh."
726.0,Provider,huh.
8994.0,Patient,"um I just try to hold on to the good. I try to let things go to the best of my ability. I. I you know I always think that like you know, at the end of the day, you know, things will you know. I have to believe in God Okay, because if I didn't I would be really screwed. So I always think in in my heart of hearts that you know God is going to send me something like you know, give me. find the right place where I belong, and then it's just going to magically appear out of nowhere and it's going to be a bridge out of this like hell."
726.0,Provider,I think it's important.
8994.0,Patient,"I have this um I am APP that like. notifies me 10 times a day of like. Good things like you're beautiful. you're stronger than you think. it's been really helping a lot. it's just really hard to. Have a life, where like nobody really here. I feel very isolated alone. i'm sorry just give me one second okay. And I don't know why I feel like things are going to get better eventually. You know, maybe it's just like I feel like i'm delusional. That like after 38 years of suffering and misery and up dope shit constantly happening to me. And having nobody, I really do feel like you know what. today's the day things are going to change and turn around and I do believe that. yeah today's gonna be a good day. It just it's it's just hard because, like, I will hold on to these positive things and have this like blind optimistic faith and it's just year after year, nothing happens. Little things happen like but it's again, I think we were talking about this last week it's it's there too little, too late it's too little. it's not enough."
726.0,Provider,I don't little things have gotten better.
8994.0,Patient,"Okay, like. I found the you know the outpatient surgeries for my my bath but I had to pay out out of pocket, but I do feel better, but I also was in constant pain for fucking 10 years. Okay i'm. You know my job bella's you know be you know that fell into my lap, but it still doesn't afford me. You know, but it is a happy, please mine."
726.0,Provider,Good. Man that feels happy yeah.
8994.0,Patient,My professional life is going great. it's going amazing Unfortunately I I still can't make ends meet. I am broke I a lot of the time don't have enough money for food. i'm 105 pounds. I had a bowl of cereal in the last I would say 18 hours. I have no vehicle. I have to pay for uber's just to get to work that they're expensive.
726.0,Provider,"Is there any Community resources in your area that would have. That could help with at least food, I mean if you're if you're making under certain amount of money, you should be able to get."
8994.0,Patient,"In as of right. Now, probably making. 2200 around 20 $200 a month."
726.0,Provider,"Think. Of think oh cuz I don't live in California I don't know what the what the cut the cut offs are um, but I think that if getting connected with um. You know you're in that community of where you live there must be some sort of program that can help with that least food, like, I know that with food that they will at least give you money for that."
8994.0,Patient,"yeah I know and the thing is it's like I feel like i've tried to do stuff like that it's I just you know what it is like how am I going to get there. You know, and I I just need help, like does that make sense, like I need somebody to sit down with me and and really helped me out, you know what I mean."
726.0,Provider,yeah that sounds like i'm like a social worker or case worker at an actual facility. That will go with you and actually go through all of the resources that are available in the Community that can help provide for food that were for rent or whatever it is that's going on there should be someone to be able to do that with.
8994.0,Patient,"yeah um. Well i'm definitely, let me just get a pen and paper. and write this down forget it, because I have. yeah i'll be right."
726.0,Provider,yeah okay.
8994.0,Patient,Okay um.
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah so um.
8994.0,Patient,"So you said, a social worker."
726.0,Provider,"Something like a social worker or the. caseworker those are caseworkers are the ones that are. Helping. People with with things that are in Community based, let me see your."
8994.0,Patient,Little chilly i'm just gonna put this jacket on.
726.0,Provider,"Because I think i'm. Okay services, let me just see what we have here. Look, in your area."
8994.0,Patient,I just need to get on my feet again.
726.0,Provider,"Oh man, I thought I was gonna say cuz you're talking about food and and all of these because also basic needs, really is, and I. Think for. for doing any kind of trauma work if your basic needs are not met, either it's really hard to do process and work, because you like, if you don't feel one comfortable in your environment or you don't even have the basics like. Food and in a place that that you're staying at that you that you can maintain it's a really hard I don't think you can do it it's more like stabilization and regulating and. i'm just trying to find in your area."
8994.0,Patient,"yeah I just feel like stuck you know. Because like I didn't even move myself here, you know, like I it's way too expensive late, I was you know my roommate is pretty wealthy and her family is who moved up here. Okay, they moved me here um years ago. Okay, and I had a head injury like I had patchy amnesia and I just feel like they did that. And they fucked me over you know what i'm saying."
726.0,Provider,"we're going to me and, like the."
8994.0,Patient,"Well, I mean Why else would you move somebody to a place that they can't afford, and then they gave me a job and make me a real employee, so I have."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, I see."
8994.0,Patient,"yeah. And then you know they kind of like just you know everything was for their benefit. And they pretend that it was like, for my benefit, and I was gullible enough because I had a head injury and stuff like that, and now that they don't need me anymore they're like throwing me away. and abusing me like their kid not them personally, but their kid is I mean abusing me like just passive aggressively. And it's like I just like this is the bed that she fucking me. And now, they. Love me anymore you don't want me here anymore you're. And the thing is she's so cross misha just watches me struggle. And like has a chip on her shoulder. it's really. You know, and I I think you're right about like I think a lot of this trauma really wouldn't even be in my life if I felt like I had my basic needs met and I had a safe environment."
726.0,Provider,"Now I want i'm gonna share my screen with you one second i'm going to show you something Okay, I guess, thoughtful. The thing is, you know a lot, like you, you know things it's a matter of. Like, for example, process, it would be good for you and it's very helpful but it's like. it's like going to it's like working with the homeless population and trying to do trauma work with them it's like they have no safe place to stay they don't have a bed they don't have a room where they could be in their feelings it's it just would not work so i'm gonna. And i'm going to show you this, I I definitely and i'm showing you this because I don't think you're a dumb person I think you're very smart. it's just a matter of. You have a lot of trauma and so, so this is what i'm going to show you here. Okay. it's like this is the bottom level physiological needs this is food, this is the the living space where you live. If you don't have that we can't even think that the self actualization all the way at the top, is when you would. You know, be able to process and do work and work on yourself but right now you're mean the things that are most important right now for you would be um. If you feel stuck is is how how to get to a place where you could afford living on your own or you could move back to northeast or you could like finding resources, where you could get to being. comfortable and not like you're surviving like it's like you're surviving each day, and you have a lot of health issues i'm even wondering, and they know, and this is just so you can think about is possibly could you actually be able to get disability based on your medical needs because."
8994.0,Patient,"I I try Okay, so I started this process of getting all my medical records and whatnot whatnot. yeah and then you know it just got kind of stalled. And map i'm like against a rock and a hard place because I don't have a car, I need to I guess my cases whatever I need to get a disability attorney or something like that or talk to somebody. fucking ride I don't have the money, and then i'm working my ass off and it's like I don't what I really need is somebody that can sit down with me. And just really be like okay. That one but yeah. That to do this, that because I I can do this it's just it's hard for me because. I have short term memory stuff."
726.0,Provider,and
8994.0,Patient,it's like. Go ahead.
726.0,Provider,"I was just i'm just thinking i'm just getting all of these different like ideas as we talk and i'm thinking if you're not able to or it's tough for you in California, I wonder if. it's in the northeast it would be easier for you to get disability or get um services, because we have so many of them up in this area, do you know what I mean. Well, because but."
8994.0,Patient,"I don't know how I would. Even move there um and then i'm going to be back in a situation with my family, where I have a lot of trauma there and that's what i've been kind of going back and forth with is you know. I don't know which ones worse is surviving a winter up there with no help and having disabilities. Does that make sense, because I. yeah. It does yeah and um and then i'm back in the place where all of this trauma began. And we're surrounded by my toxic family because there they'll find me. And then i'm surrounded by friends who are great but they're drug addicts. I left the east coast, because. I didn't want to be around drugs. I didn't want to add around. being abused by my family anymore I moved out here with two grand in my pocket. And it's like and that's where I kind of am at with myself is like I might be miserable out here, but it's a lot better being on the balls in my ass out here than it has ever been in New Jersey. yeah yeah. So um. You know so it's like I yes i'm miserable I hate my life out here and i'm lonely and i'm struggling, but I would be 10 times worse up there. yeah because I would be feeling the same exact way, except for getting abused be around drugs. And then the winters are harsh and I have disappeared I don't even know how I like just even thinking about the winters out here are hard on me and i'm in southern California."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8994.0,Patient,So I really don't know what I would how like you know what i'm saying.
726.0,Provider,"One um. I think what could be helpful than is looking at employment service and having them look at your skills and experience and see in what could you make more money in based on what you already have. So, like."
8994.0,Patient,"yeah he's like I have a bachelor's degree, I have a cosmetologist license."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, then you can definitely do something with that because. i'm thinking if it's if it's if it has to do with money and income that would be then, what do I already have what skills, can I use and. Try to look at it from that angle, because that might be the way that will help you get out of your situation, because if you can make more money. Or you can at least start somewhere with that bachelor's and grow within the the work that you're doing, then you know that they'll be more increase your income as as the time goes by, in the field."
8994.0,Patient,"yeah um it's I mean I have put out a bunch of resumes. And you know again it's just how am I going to get there, with no car. I mean there is public transportation to. You know. I mean i'm not trying to make excuses or put obstacles in my path."
726.0,Provider,"Does that mean that. No, I."
8994.0,Patient,"yeah I just I mean because, like a lot of these things that you are saying I have looked into. And it's just like how the hell, am I going to get there. And it's like I mean. I don't know i'm just I just feel like media, maybe I just need a moment i'm like because I don't."
726.0,Provider,"care. If it's too overwhelming just slowing down. yeah then. overwhelmed yeah so don't worry just we let's break everything up piece by piece because, looking at it as a big thing is not. yeah it's gonna be like oh I don't want to do that this too much."
8994.0,Patient,"yeah and I. already feel myself getting like you know. Yes, yeah."
726.0,Provider,yeah so.
8994.0,Patient,"I just need somebody really to just sit down and be like step one. Step two. Was this is what we need for step one boom, because I can follow direction. You know i'm. After you know what i'm saying like okay now do this now do that go here blah blah like I can i'm pretty good at that I just I feel very overwhelmed because I don't even know where to begin."
726.0,Provider,"Start like this. let's not focus on what you need to do let's look at what's going on right now and what's, the most important thing to tackle first okay. So if you just look at it basic all right transportation right would that be a bigger priority right now, because that's what. yeah used to get you to work and."
8994.0,Patient,"Vice versa, I mean that would definitely but then i'm thinking like okay. This is my problem with the transportation Okay, is, I only make 20 $200 around about a month it's like I can't afford a payment I can't afford the insurance. Oh yeah so my so my best option here is like to probably buy a new used car or a you know, a used car that runs but. I don't have payments on, and then we just have the liability insurance, because I, I do have great insurance and and because I have a driving record my insurance wouldn't cost that much."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
8994.0,Patient,"You know um so that is definitely what like needs to happen, but it's like it's hard to save up when i'm paying for uber's and there's a lot of expenses that are just like going so i'm i'm I mean to get a game plan for sure yeah."
726.0,Provider,"I would, the way that I would just start, then, is I would look at some numbers, how much if you were to jot down what you spend in a week or a month just on verse for your work okay. Okay, and how much you actually get paid at your job."
8994.0,Patient,hold on one second. Okay.
726.0,Provider,"So, then you can when you could do is. Look at the difference what am I, making what am I spending on call on numbers on this or that and then we'll go from there, because once you have the numbers that will tell you more where. And like jot down expenses, if you were to write in a month, what a rent what you paying let's say some utility maybe your cell phone. Where and i'm sure you i'm sure you've already been doing this, but like where can I cut costs, where can I reassess this or that and just looking at the numbers just basic numbers of what you make what you spend. Just start there don't worry yourself to overwhelm yourself with. Anything else. All right and just do one step at a time, and so, when we come back we'll reassess and and and look at this together."
8994.0,Patient,"Thank you. Okay, I definitely will i'll definitely do this for sure, because it's definitely something that I need to do."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. And i'll play like. Money and it'll all come back to how much can I afford and then working from their advanced figuring out what's the game plan or Do I need to do that, to make a little bit more Whatever the case may be, will look at that later, but let's just look at the numbers, right now, as they are. And I just want to make an appointment with you because already have someone waiting. Do you want to do same day same time in two weeks."
8994.0,Patient,"um Okay, so I know that we already have to February appointments."
726.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, then we're all set them. On and i'm not going to think okay yeah we're good then. Alright, so just take tiny steps be gentle with yourself you're doing good you're doing the best you can all right."
