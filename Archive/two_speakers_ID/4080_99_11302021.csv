4080.0,Patient,"I mean it's just too small apartment that I live in it's just too small for four of us. So I just I need a house, they need their own space so whenever I get a house and who he will be with me so."
99.0,Provider,"Do you think he needs anything else from you, in the meantime just been kind of separated from you, and knowing that the other boys are able to be with you."
4080.0,Patient,"I don't know he actually does okay like we talk every day, and he comes over. So. I mean, he does pretty good. And he understands like. He wants to know right that's what I try to explain to him, like you have all of that right now and I can't give you that. So, like he kind of understands he's like he's okay with it for now."
99.0,Provider,"Do you think i'm just really putting myself in both of your positions of you know, the. Just the you know, there is an ache about not being able to be together, do you think it. would be.

4080.0,Patient,"um dinner movie bullying. We don't really have a lot. To be honest, kid wise, you know. Maybe."
99.0,Provider,yeah just something because i'm i'm just imagining even though he's okay with it on some level there's probably some level that he's like you know the other boys get to be with her.
4080.0,Patient,And right.
99.0,Provider,"I don't get to yet so this just seems like maybe, something that would help to have some special time. Right okay. Okay, how about another goal."
