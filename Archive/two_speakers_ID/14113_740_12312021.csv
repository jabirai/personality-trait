Okay um. yeah so it's a good thing and we're not sure when she's in a component oh that's, the only thing."
740.0,Provider,hate the circumstances will be grateful for the break.
14113.0,Patient,"I told my mom I was like i'm sorry but i'm glad she's there because I take stress off of my plate, I told her, I was like. Sorry for that. But I told her, I was like I am kind of stress free because. guilty my mom saying you guys are all comfortable and i'm over here in the hospital i'm I was like. What are they comfortable and I went no tell us a little comfortable. break. So basically didn't do anything on he. didn't do anything on Christmas um. What else the interview, I feel like I did on I feel like i'm not going to get it, but i'm trying to be positive. I two questions just caught me off guard and also all i'll say anything about anything for those those eating beans and asked me that so we'll see and i'll find that out mid January, like 15 to 16 for when you told me. But one thing that's been really getting under my skin and I am obviously still in the process of trying to recover and grieve from all that you know but. My so firstly good friend, I guess i'll call her my best friend great I guess i'm. were talking and she goes to a talk to Matthew the other day, and they go uh huh I had asked we're just talking about everything, and she brought it up. And she was like sometimes when Sony went Oh, I went by the way, what's going to change the subject all the iona but he's still got under my skin i'll still honored. And best friend told me, the other day Well, this is the two days ago i'll say probably. Little right after when we had our last meeting. goes well, he talks to me every now and then he's like but I Andrew i'm telling you like we're not close at all like it's not like we talked to every day. I am honestly, just to be very honest, which I always i'm with you, I am very. hurt i'm very hurt i'm hurting so much inside but also angry. Because and i'm sorry I don't know if I sound selfish or seen this, but why are you banking off my friends, because you ain't got a lot of friends yourself, those are my friends. And to i'm a little bothered with both of my friends, because i'm like that's like, if I have to put in this way it's a friend code that's my ex i'm hurt it's a breakup while your. And what a slap in the face slash middle finger that he's cool with y'all but not talking to me. Right really I went what the Fuck is that about this morning, which but I haven't been. crying every now and then because of that I cried on Christmas Day to my roommate after he gave me the gift and I was like I just have to vocalize this to you. I went how painful does that fuel also give you in season we're together and you were in my circumstances and even though I was cool with him, I would not be talking to because you're my friend. And my roommates excuse was and if I told him excuse he'd be very pissed I don't care I didn't tell him. He goes Andrew he basically lived here, we were basically all roommates equals, and I mean him get along I went, I understand that i'm not asking you to hate him this is him, but you need to understand, I want you to just try to come see where i'm coming from the circumstances that. How horrible does that feel even if you don't tell me i'm just even in the background number thinking Look how much do you guys talk. What do you guys talk about. How do I know you're letting you know and you're not telling me like how much does that suck. And then, and then, I guess, he told me he asked my roommate always my MIC still at his house so you're asking my best friend about your bike that's at my family's house got it. And I told I pointed that ultimately what the Fuck I was like it's not your family's house, I was like i'm not mad at you about that I was like I don't know how to express this to you, I was like i'm not mad at you, but I am bother."
740.0,Provider,I am very yeah.
14113.0,Patient,"And he was like well I don't bring it up to you because I never bothered feels like but yeah but see you're my best friend I should be doing everything. Just how you know everything I tell you everything else, like that really genuinely really fucking hurts me and I started crying really bad he started really crying to him. And he goes I am so sorry he was like I completely understand he goes, again, I just want you to. Have clothes I don't talk to him every day he's like literally it's like probably once in a great while he's like i'll tell him if he posted something that is this crammed like. Of the mountains and it's snowing goes i'll say oh my gosh it's so pretty we'll talk for five minutes it. doesn't matter it doesn't matter I was like he's throwing me and that expression of or I did him so wrong I cheated on him and everything and I didn't do any of that and I was thrown in the trash can with the other assholes I was like just imagine how that feels. yeah and i've been having nothing but dreams and feeling really shitty about that almost every night, since we were we told me like a week and a half ago, two weeks ago. My other friend is. jumping she still um. I just. I am angry hurt i'm very angry hurt you know I mean i'm more actually not more of any of them i'm 50% or 50% matt and I don't know I can't do much about it, I. truth be told, I can't do much about it, you know I can't make my roommate not talk to somebody or what but I guess in a way that kind of feels disrespectful from him because i'm like. you've only known him for a year and i'm sorry i'm going to put it like this, we have been best friends for 10 years. And you're really going to try to debate this with me where you want to be friends with him. Knowing how hurt I am about it, my friend Sean turned him down said I don't think what's cool that we're talking because I don't know the circumstances between Andrew and he still hurt. I appreciate that so much, but again my my my best friend Sean was like jewelry to be a bitch oh wait no, no, no, no, I don't want any I don't want any of that just do me a favor just you know. like an adult just tell me no I don't think it's right for us, we know, I think you know to you and android figure out what you got. going on between y'all then i'll know what I need to do. But. that's been under my skin superbad I cry Christmas Day, I Chris I cried on Eve this last night before I woke with someone had a very deep dream about him again, you know it's been so difficult and it's like. I don't really know what to do, I feel like there's nothing I can do, and I know what I should do and me, trying to do that trying to focus on work and do me it's like. it's only bringing me so far. And me having that dream this morning has me super emotional, like all day today but i've been like this the past days days you know and. My room, he told me he goes, you know you wanted space, I went, I understand that, but why does he have to be friends with my friends. I understand he doesn't have any friends, but that doesn't mean OK now we're exes and we didn't on bad terms, maybe his friends can be mine, no, no, no, no. And my friend Laura she goes she goes i'm not so much disappointed in your friend she goes i'm more disappointed in him, because he should know better. You know and she's explained it better, but I I agree to throws like Okay, that I can now Okay, that I can agree do I, like it just has me messed up you know and. It does hurt. Because I still do miss him. I as bad as it sounds, I am making all these changes, yes, for me, I have been focusing on a lot with work i'm trying to do my routines and everything but still, deep down in the back. i'm still putting that small percent there for him kind of like i'm doing this for you, and this is what I get like I can understand if I did you wrong if I get you so wrong then yeah don't talk to me, but I didn't I just didn't communicate well and my anxiety didn't, let us do anything. Right that's a learning process slash the anxiety part, yes, I should have got their much student because he told me like 50 times that able to blame for. But. You know it's almost coming down, as if to like i'm trash to him and my roommates like no that's not true hey when James come on. he's obligated to ask how i'm doing because y'all are cool. What do you expect them to do not ask about me."
740.0,Provider,Really yeah.
14113.0,Patient,"That doesn't make any sense he's obligated to. new to me, and let me just a quick. And i'm just kind of like what a slap in the face, I was like that is some fucked up feeling I was like. And i'm sorry that I am coming at you like this i'm not mad at you, but I am frustrated because I feel like you've done this to me once before, and. he's my ex it hurts, and you guys are cool like even if you don't tell me like how shitty does that feel come on. And he goes well you know he wanted to space like he wanted you to do you and you to recover and he wants to do him and do the things he wasn't able to do in the relationship on Okay, but why am I, being treated like a villain really, really. You know so like i'm just i've been a little messed up in the head, you know to mean and. I yeah i've just i've been I feel like i've been slacking off on a lot of things I feel like. i've just been kind of like emotionally kind of messed up. I even thought the other day I was getting sick, which I do, I was for like a day or two, which is weird I was like super extremely light headed to where I couldn't even drive properly and then like I woke up the next, and it was fine. You know what I mean, so I just I feel like I just emo emotionally have been a little like jacked up in the head. You know and. Just super frustrating just super frustrating just annoyed and I don't know I don't know I feel like. This the past two weeks have passed, I feel like where I was at one point where I was like i'm not making progress, but i'm not going backwards either i'm like stuck in a pothole right now and i'm just trying to climb out. So, and I don't I don't like that meeting and. I feel like i'm just kind of like I don't know what else to do really know."
740.0,Provider,"What do you want to do. I don't even know do on the screen, do you want to shout do you want upon something."
14113.0,Patient,"yeah all of those I want to. Like screaming punch the shit out of something and just break it what which one i'm gonna do here, but. Like I just I haven't."
740.0,Provider,Yet found it on groupon.
14113.0,Patient,boy yeah and I.
740.0,Provider,"want you to go. You got to go, I say gone groupon either was you're somebody who had the same attributes yeah like on groupon. They haven't really cheap and just go into a breakout room, with just all breaking so."
14113.0,Patient,"And i've actually look those up like a year to go to or to like. yeah like a year or two ago, like i've looked them up countless times. i'm like damn there's none year you. Know there's one where it's at I get straight up anxiety, even going to the downtown la. New York style I avoided at all costs, I don't know but it's funny because I always have wanted to do that, and I feel like. People would see a whole nother side of me they've never seen and i'm like just stay behind that glass window don't do not even come near we want to start ripping it things to shred you know so. it's but yeah it's a lot of like. angry her is the only thing describe it."
740.0,Provider,"I thought I wanted to wait until you get done, of course, and then I was like well I guess i'll say my piece when he doing you know put things back into perspective and say things that he don't like. Because I ain't gotta leave which Okay, I was, I was once we get off the line I don't see you next time I see Okay, so I don't mind. me."
14113.0,Patient,Telling ya know yeah.
740.0,Provider,"But, so I must say this. If you, and this is, and this is what I know to be true. If you didn't miss as much as you do. And if you're not if you if you if you didn't miss your ex as much as you do. And if the thoughts of how things ended and how things transpired, and what is being said behind your back. isn't affecting you as much as it is. I don't think you make that much of a big deal out of it. But it's The fact of it's The fact of the matter of it's your roommate gets to have something that you can."
14113.0,Patient,"know and i'll be honest that's exactly what it is that does piss me off, because the example that I said I got thrown in the bin like I did him so wrong, I did horrible things in and I didn't. I called myself out, and I said yes, I wasn't communicating rate like I should have I was being a little Brett half the time shutting down not say anything take the blame for that okay. Other thing was not being on top of my anxiety, he was right, I kept prolonging it kept prolonging it and he got extra man he's like okay so wait a minute. Now that we're broken up now, you went and got their vehicles that gets me so mad he goes i've told you so many times, he goes in now you why, and I told them was like some times, people need a wake up call, and this is my wake up call so i'm telling you it."
740.0,Provider,wouldn't it wouldn't have this conversation I mean.
14113.0,Patient,"Oh no that was that was like basically the day after, like We broke up and he drove all."
740.0,Provider,kinds of.
14113.0,Patient,"stuff like yeah this was this was yeah. super then. You know, and he goes that's that honestly really upsets me he goes i've told you so many times, and now they were broken up, and until you i'm done now you want to do it, he was really he goes that's just ridiculous."
740.0,Provider,"Well that's the hell no it's not it's accurate because of the end at the end of the day, with someone is in a situation and someone else is telling them. Mind you can be so deep emotional in the situation to where you don't see what they're talking about attack after the situation is over, and then you realize the error of your ways and realize, you need to get people. To see what they post and see when they're. Emotionally blind."
14113.0,Patient,"that's exactly what I meant by wake up call, I went now i'm starting to open. that's exactly so they went, its opening my eyes, this whole situation because they care for you lot and that's i'm doing it, I am sorry that i'm doing it late i'm like, but again. This is the wake up call that I needed, and if we can just work things out you go with me through my therapy, you know. I want to make this work and he goes, I have to think about it. Two days go by three days go away or something like that, and he goes honestly I just feel like we're both not in a really good places right now I feel like you really need to get on top of your stuff and i'm really hurt. And i'm like Okay, I went I mean it's not just me, though, I need you to realize it's also you, your insecurities have pushed me so far away as well, but I. The reason why, and I told my roommate this that on Christmas and I was crying I was like the reason why I would get so mad and just. instantly go and read, not even green yellow then read i'll just go read and just get frickin mad was because I wanted things to work so bad, I wanted things to just be so. Everything normal because nobody's normal, but I just wanted things to just work between us and be good, in the sense of why can't you trust me. I haven't done anything to give you insecurities to question me I don't understand you're you're still bleeding from your last accent x's on me it's not fair yeah. You know and that's why I would get so mad and then he would tell me roommate last the last day he goes I also don't appreciate him, seeing that I should just go find somebody else he would repeat that arena and I went. Am I wrong for saying that he always thought I was with somebody else he. always thought I was there was an hour late the middle person."
740.0,Provider,"Why, lastly, the mind."
14113.0,Patient,"Because he. knows how I am very well, he knows how I take criticism how I react to certain things all of that and i've asked him, can you talk to him, and then I guess Matthew to define himself also to go talk to them and be like."
740.0,Provider,"I guess i'm gonna say. Okay, because i'm gonna say what you need when you did they. You open up the door to make her roommate for like he was okay. broke up are not broken up you don't matter, but you open up the door and major room I feel like it was okay see when you drag third parties into your relationship. Then they feel like Oh well, I didn't see anything wrong with it because I mean any other time, you would tell me to go talk to."
14113.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So you got to keep things in perspective into all things because you can say well you know the bro Code, the promo code is after a day you. know because being Nice is that you invited him into your relationship, which means now that now that he was able to develop a relationship with Joe access and still have one with you and so now, when you cut them all okay with me you cut them off to but wait a minute here. In the first place. You gotta be. You that's a no no. that's my five year old version of this a no no. Because mean what we try to do is is that we invite people in to be the middleman it to be the mediator, but then, at the same time, dealing with stuff go live okay now I need you to put a boundary. Why don't mean. Within I mean wouldn't you know things because i'm saying is can be honest, which is good that's all I got for you is that, if you're almost somebody if you don't want somebody to have that kind of relationship with someone. Not knowing where it's going to go don't bring them me don't invited me and initially."
14113.0,Patient,"I guess it was just desperate for help you know because he's my best friend we've been in business for 10 years and he seemed to go left and right, left and right and being angry and everything so and I got too accustomed to that. So I see where you're coming from you know I just and I would tell me about her and I told him I was like I care for him so much I already see a future of. married I was getting our own place together everything else but damn does he make life impossible sometimes i'm like he literally thinks that i'm always doing something with somebody else. i'm, to the point where I might as well just go do something with somebody else I was like that's how bad he has me also but i'm not going to do that. And i'll talk sick I would tell Matthew oh good do you want me to go sleep with somebody else I can because seems like the way you're running my ass i'm like it's like you want me to. You can have something to pitch at me about and you go well know what would you say that when you don't understand. You were driving me absolutely insane with this also what have I done to give you any reason to think about something else I was like for god's sake, I will say. You are here with me every single day, every minute of the day when do I have time to go hook up with somebody when do I have time to go cheat on you. I know, and to i'm not like I just don't get it, I was like you you're in denial you think you're not messed up from your exes, but you are, you have told me the stories of each of them twice, one of them went on craigslist try finding another guy when he was traveling. One of them. told you, he cheated and and and when you walked into a bar to make things better because that's what he wanted you some kissing another guy really i'm like I know your damn stories by heart. i'm like you were not recovered from your last relationships and that scares me, and I even asked you, am I a rebound because you broke up with your ex six months. Six months before we started talking that has me weary and I was like it sometimes I think that you shouldn't be with anybody until you get your shit together, and I would be very mean like that, but at the same time, I was being very honest, at the same time i'm just. What I meant to a certain point, I get very aggressive and I don't mean to but that's what i'm like you're not waking up you're not listening to what i'm trying to do you hear me but you're not listening. To me i'm the same way."
740.0,Provider,"Exactly, because at the end of the day, guess what broken pieces of broken pieces."
14113.0,Patient,"And I told him I was like i'm the same way don't get me wrong i'm not sitting around saying. I don't get bothered by some of the crap you do, or you don't get bothered by the stuff I do. I get that i'll say, but you have been telling me, I think you oh you're doing better and thank you like, I see i'm seeing you're working on it, I went. I would like to see the scene back to you, but I can't Matthew. Was it because you literally you're an investigator i'm going to start calling you that you investigate me you try to get clues and ask specific questions to get out of me, so you can see if i'm lying. To answering that question from the other day, and I make up another answer for today that's what you do. i'll say that I am not going to be doing that for long I was like I care for you so much, and I just i'm sorry I don't know I don't show it in the way you want it i'm like, but I have my own language of."
740.0,Provider,"toxic gases too much. Can I say this too much that's. Too much. Time job and i'm not even work I don't I don't even work there hold my own husband okay that's too much. Okay, is that a day if somebody is insecure you got trust issues and I just kind of stuff and we got to ask people, Mr rebound nine times out of 10 you are going to know the truth, yes you're very bad because it takes more than six months to get over anybody. Especially somebody who you say you learn it takes it takes longer. To get over anybody, and then you don't heal in that amount of time, especially when emotions are involved, so of course you are rebound Now let me tell you some Andrew limping so i'm pretty i'm just gonna be honest, which i'm. saying you will have to put up your eyes. Okay, you can't let your emotions make decisions you're going to have written with a relationship your emotions made the decision. uh huh let's be honest, yes indeed."
14113.0,Patient,"Yes, because he because. he's out of everyone i've been with."
740.0,Provider,"he's the last seconds because guess what which. Is the more with less problems liberty. bell that's a lot just would you this would you, this will mean listen to what you got to say made my mouth dry maybe for like I just came off an eight hour shift okay that'll make no dogs okay that's. Not and you have to understand that you deserve better in the end, the fact of the matter, that you have with if I get better than maybe we can we can what we can say we are separated. The see, I know, but the thing about it is it's normal to miss somebody you all have that's called grieving you don't grieve just."
14113.0,Patient,"Recently, beginning so grieved that with."
740.0,Provider,You yes.
14113.0,Patient,yeah no I know.
740.0,Provider,"But let me say you know things um I don't see you do Joe point now my turn get on my soapbox. Now. You and I mean that you can't get mad at a roommate who you invited he. Will you post me long whoa, this is a lawyer, just because of the fact. That he's talking to someone that you allow that you gave him permission to talk to. Now, after your relationship was over the geographical right to Romania say I don't want you talking to you. You just you just assumed."
14113.0,Patient,Yes.
740.0,Provider,that's what.
14113.0,Patient,"I made it clear, I try make it. Just because I didn't know how to see it like I don't want to sound I just don't want to sound ignorant and childish, and everything you know, to me, I feel like I shouldn't have. You shouldn't have all your friends, you know, like."
740.0,Provider,"What do you think. Well, what is this."
14113.0,Patient,So don't like saying a lot but that's what makes me more. Anxious and no not.
740.0,Provider,A thing.
14113.0,Patient,"In this situation, no, no, no, no, no, no i'm just saying like when I don't vocal that's what makes me more anxious that's what makes me self eat myself inside so that's why on Christmas, I was like I just I have to tell you. Like i'm sorry I was like I had to you."
740.0,Provider,"It should have been something initially said once it was over, because you can't expect people to read your mind I don't care how long you've known me. Especially when you gave me permission to talk to him so that means now i've grown a custom. to something that you gave me permission to do. So how is it now, after i've grown accustomed to something that you gave me permission to do now, as opposed to, no, no, no, leave him alone, what did you ever vocalize those things. You post the say something. About about looking childish and and and and and."
14113.0,Patient,You know yeah and but what catches me off guard is I didn't think he was going to talk to my friends. Why.
740.0,Provider,Like I think that Andrew.
14113.0,Patient,Because a lot of the things he told me Andrew.
740.0,Provider,"Andrew, let me tell you why you let me tell you why did I don't know why you thought the same thing, so the same way you feel right now you're just saying when he. Okay, so at the end of the day, first of all like you say you ain't got no friends and then secondly manager yo your friends became his friends, so he feel like okay well in order for me to stay in touch. Because, regardless of the fact of what he said to me, you know launch. So regardless if the end of the day, that has a meaning, but we know that we're not healthy for each other we're not meant to be together you don't matter how much your emotions want you to be where the the the the the the the reality of the fact is we ate meat to be together. But at the same time, people do stuff like that, just to reach out to get closer to you, so you take the job because he can't he calls me, let me hang on we just see his friends."
14113.0,Patient,Here I don't think he gives two shits about me I don't.
740.0,Provider,"Why you don't think they, why do you think he putting it out as effort and out his work, because if he didn't he wouldn't call nobody not even your friends. It is okay, what about this year, I know that it is, but let me tell you this, though. everything happens for reason. And right now right now you're getting better. Not for him or for them, or for anybody else your focus is on you. And, of course, this gonna hurt because the postcard there was emotions involved anytime emotions are involved is gonna hurt. there's just period. Right, but one thing I will say is this moving forward. You cannot expect people to assume."
14113.0,Patient,The course.
740.0,Provider,"Next time, you should go ahead and set those boundaries, initially with your friends. Of what you want i've known people since they were little. But even still to this day I steal my me and my husband known each other for a while and we've been married for just for a little bit before you know just enough to survive. But you know my hometown is another my real I know my reason i'm not in my room you gotta you gotta tell me i'm not sure we we breathe the same breath, we want to flash we got a whole baby together. which you know, he said, I know my arena, oh no. You want to know why. A you know you want to know why he says that and not understand want to know why engine because people change. And people change their mind. Right, which means that you cannot make. You cannot assume that your friend should automatically know what you expect and what you need if you don't verbalize. Especially if you invited me again."
14113.0,Patient,"I guess he assumed like I said because he knows me so well that I, this is not the first time i've said it, though that's why that's why. I even told him I forgot, who, I think it was about sell it was about I was like I was like I don't want you. Like talking to them so it's not the first time that's i'm a little shocked I was like.

14113.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,If I bring somebody into your life they don't mean that they're yours he's mine.

Like three times and I was like i'm sorry i'm sending like a bit chills like. i'm angry hurt right now I was crying will say this, I was like i'm. angry here, I was like but yeah my ex. i'll say. Thank you, when heather I don't know why the hell, he thinks it's okay to just keep it cool with the old anyone to give shonda fucking President. And Sean turn them down because I told him turn down. I was like but same time Sean was going to do it anyways he's like, but he wanted to hear it from me directly to tell him to not accept it, I was like that I appreciate Sean knows he knows what shawn's did for, and you know I don't know how he does things and it went. So so hold on hold on. So you mean to tell me like if he was like oh hey if I got you're gonna go take it with him, I went if you did that I don't even know where you stand i'd be pissed off like I would be livid if you fucking hung out with him. And he was Andrew he's like can we I forgot what you said, actually I forgot what he said he said that i'm being honest but it's like you said. it's something i'm not kidding and I don't see I don't see it as fear and i'm not saying that in any childish any selfish way I don't see that as right unfair, because those are my friends and i'm sorry you ain't got a lot of friends, but go make friends somewhere. don't make on your mind you know i'm hurt be you think it's Okay, for you to my friends and if I reached out to your sisters or your friends, I know for a God given fact. you'd be like that's weird that's weird. Really. yeah I know you're contradicting yourself, and I can hands down say that for a fact. If we had this conversation if I was talking to you right now let's just say just obviously my example I reached out to him right now and was calling him out like, why do you think it's okay for me to call my friends talk to my friends got knowing. If I reached out to your sisters and your friends Nikki bianca kane and all them, you would be weirded out and you'd be asking them every single time what is he telling you what are you guys talking about. Like that's weird is don't you think it's weird that he's reaching out to you, so why, would you be doing that no but like I said I am doing my absolute best not to get to me. yeah. i'm not."
740.0,Provider,"i'm not a mom to my roommate. So it's okay that it gets to you it's okay yo oh my gosh you're human it's gonna get to you and it's gonna stained and it's gonna hurt. And it's going to make you angry and frustrated and then, when you see your roommate yes Okay, because when you see your roommate it's not like you're going to see him like he was before you're going to see him as a friend that also talks to your ex that's."
14113.0,Patient,"that's what I have, I have been a little. I have been a little distant with him also talking. A little bit every now and then, but I can see that I missed it I can. I can see and feeling. My friend heather having colder in days, not even for Christmas no nothing, nothing like that. i'm telling myself damn you are being petty you are being pissed. i'm a I don't know how to really go about it so i'm just going off of what my body and my mind, or just telling me to go what to do, I that's the best that i'm doing. In the job i'm not history."
740.0,Provider,"Now let me ask you this is your body in your mind, or is it just your emotions this this dictating in running the show."
14113.0,Patient,"Will that it's my emotions yeah. I know and that's. that's, the best thing I can do, because i'm not gonna fake it till I make it kind of. Needle kind of thing because that's just more damage. On top of."
740.0,Provider,"This is what I will say right communication and I told you, I told you this before the communication is always the key. take a deep breath it's okay that communication is always the key. And this is what you this is what you do you address the situation had on instead of just being silent, you know what i'm going to punish you guys by being cited i'm not gonna say anything okay well."
14113.0,Patient,You know my friend who they're just not know that i'm bothered about a new that she doesn't know.
740.0,Provider,What i'm saying you need to communicate.
14113.0,Patient,And that's what i've been thinking of how to talk her. promise I promise I mean the past two days have been.
740.0,Provider,"With. me we've got a good few moments. let's talk about shall we. So how you communicate, is that you say this hey. So I recently discovered that you still talk to someone so. And I will be lying to you. If if I say that they didn't bother me because he really does. When I discovered it, you know i'm saying I was really hurt by it, because we're friends and i'm the one who brought this person into your life. and not the other way around, of course, that's on me for not expressing you i'm saying have felt early on, or putting those boundaries in place wants a relationship indeed. However, at the same time I just thought, because we were friends you run it by me first before continuing communication with him. But I do have to be honest with you the reasons why i've been so solid and being so this is because i've been really, really hard. And I didn't want to fake around you I didn't want to mistreat you or I didn't want to take my anger out on you, so therefore i'm just taking time right now to gather my thoughts and my emotions and and and try to stabilize everything before I proceed with communication I."
14113.0,Patient,Actually. really like how that sounds and i'm gonna do my best. To keep it like that that's.
740.0,Provider,going to pop off or.
14113.0,Patient,"We would never do that definitely never do that, but I know I would say more aggressively you nearly mean like and not meaning it to be aggressive but yeah i'm definitely going to say it, the way that you said it. Because i've only really confronted her once about something."
740.0,Provider,"Would you say to your roommate as well. again say hey, even though we had this conversation i'm not gonna lie to you. You know i'm never going to be fake around you will be in France, for a long time. And I would I would never want our relationship to Ian just because, just because of something like this, however, I will be honest with you and say hey. You know if there are moments, and if there are times that i'm a little different is because of the fact that this is still new news to me. And i'm still trying to gather my thoughts and my emotions and I never want to be fake with you because I love you we were best we're best for you to stuff like that. You know i'm saying, but i'm not gonna lie to you and say i'm not mad. i'm not gonna lie to you said that i'm still not frustrated I can admit that I haven't gotten overreaching and so you just gave me a little more time I will greatly appreciate it, but I do appreciate you being honest with me, and let me know front of that you still talking to him."
14113.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,Because I mean.
14113.0,Patient,"you listen to anything you have to tell them, you know what I mean if I have to tell them like, can I just talk to you he's very."
740.0,Provider,"yeah and it's just. it's just i'm at least letting them know where you are current because the first conversation that you and your room my head, it was more so you angry frustrated man stop cursing crying I was gonna, so now we are getting to a place to where okay. i'm still upset However, I have maintained my anger right i'm not going over the age, but I want to be honest with you and let you know where I am currently. that's it because i'll move together, so my."
14113.0,Patient,"And he's and he's done so much for me, I even told him I was like I have everything you've ever done for me, James auto like I was like I don't know how I would prefer pay, you would have to pony up my life out of like everything. Everything you've done for me, because he really has he's done."
740.0,Provider,"And then, this. should be made a statement I mean he cut you off, but, but when Adam was time, but what I will say is this, you also have, and I want you to keep that what you said into perspective he's done so much for me. Like we have been friends for a decade. As a lot of your friends to somebody and the fact that you know. And this is just to help you heal faster, you know. That he would never do nothing to harm you intentionally. You know that he would never do anything to make you to intentionally make you angry or upset you or to question law using between you both. You know that, which is why you been to France, for a long time, so you know that his behaviors and things of that nature. were not intentional to hurt you or to anger you and you also know that if he wants you to know he didn't have to take the truth but but, but because of the fact that he loves you he honors your friendship. That he was willing to tell you the truth, and, to be honest with you, even though he knew react."
14113.0,Patient,And he's also going based off of what you told me to tell them. The whole don't tell me anything about him I don't care if you.
740.0,Provider,don't be don't be so he's going.
14113.0,Patient,"In and I see that and that's why I told him i'm not mad at you, but I don't know how to explain how it feels like, but I am I am very bothered James."
740.0,Provider,"You are mad at him. You had me walking around China trying to make yourself, and I think like he'll bad guy just because you because you because you have emotions, we all."
14113.0,Patient,"Know i'll tell him if i'm pissed at him I told him before i'm like. What the hell, do you mean by that i've called him out."
740.0,Provider,"which I just were mad at him. Come on, Andrew."
14113.0,Patient,I guess it was I just didn't know how to say.
740.0,Provider,hey like.
14113.0,Patient,I wasn't sure.
740.0,Provider,Because yeah.
14113.0,Patient,"it's just perfectly he said he he's told me those intro never do anything to hurt you, you know I didn't want to tell you that, because I know it hurts you even told me like a few days ago, he goes. Well, I mean I don't want to say is a problem, as he was here, he goes that's when we did this net he goes, but I don't tell you the things he said, because I know how you feel about all that. So you're right what you're saying he's not doing anything to hurt me it's not on purpose and he even told me he goes I don't tell you anything you say, because you asked me not to tell you, and i'm like. it's like okay that's fair that's fair like is. yeah it's just shitty shitty overall, but I just yeah I have to come to terms with specific things so."
740.0,Provider,"And the reason why I told you. What I told you, and I still say know that even to this day. Because one thing I do know. Is that if you were told. Things they were going on with your aches you would do this right here, and we would never make any progress."
14113.0,Patient,"library to that because I know know me I gotta be asking me every day, you asked about me, what do you say about me, can you tell him this for me. Right try to persuade him to I in your thousand percent right, because I know that's what I would do it and i'm not gonna lie, it has been hard. anything about him. Nothing. Nothing at all even my friend said he goes. When I bring up examples which is. Only every now and then i'll go in Matthew he goes who and he'll do that, like no we don't speak of her name and he'll say. They like he says her for everybody. Because we don't speak of her he's a BA haunt me your example, so you can just play a game, I went Okay, so he tries to he helps me to you know, to me, he will kind of be like. No, no let's not talk about that let's not know we don't know that person right now let's just. focus on what we're doing here. You know kind of thing so but it's been hard but i'm glad that. you're doing it because it hasn't made yeah you're right I wouldn't be doing this 24 seven. mm hmm and usually I am stubborn and I don't listen a lot and I don't do this and not out but. I can feel myself doing those changes because. I want to get better, I want to learn, I want to grow, though. yeah. So."
740.0,Provider,it's okay. I appreciate you for sharing with me today. it's gonna take time.
14113.0,Patient,Just I hear how my mindset goes back to. Stay positive you know you guys probably will get back like and then I think of US laughing back and see you.
740.0,Provider,Know don't like don't don't stay positive. Now positive. don't you initially. Andrew i'm up to speed layer like lady. know I guess i'm confused and like we said don't see positive like. I don't know I mean don't stay positive with the fact that you know what eventually down the road we're going to come back together so that's why I need to keep up no. No.
14113.0,Patient,I stopped myself.
740.0,Provider,"right because, like, I told you in the beginning who's to say once you get on the other side of this if you even want somebody like that. who's to say, but you won't even know if the changes real or if it's artificial, because how you know he doing what you're doing. You don't know how you even though you've almost like a you might want."
14113.0,Patient,"Those to see, for example. I want, I want your personal opinion. uh huh which you always give, of course. What if I did get back with him how bad, would you judge me."
740.0,Provider,"You know, and the crazy part about it is um."
14113.0,Patient,What is.
740.0,Provider,"That somebody and I got you. I got. i'm not innocent thing i'm not going to judge you because it's your decision i've been in situations like these. Two where i've told clients i'm Like you, I think you shouldn't all sides points towards know and then they end up doing it anyway, because they don't feel they don't feel I don't see what you see, and I, you know I think it's I think it could work. And so, but then, then I come, we come back like this week, for example, and and I had a client and and she was like. It didn't work. And you know you know I try I used to use this phrase all the time, but I stopped using it. I tried it I used to say stuff like you know what I hate to I hate to say I told you so so i'm just not gonna say anything at all. And so, and the thing about it this figuratively speaking. yeah you chose to go back to the direction. I know not, I think I know that it will cause you to regress and before you call us him to progress because."
14113.0,Patient,to progress. hmm interesting okay.
740.0,Provider,"So, and the reason why I say that is because that it is very difficult to bring somebody up to a place that they had never experienced, but they can always take you back to where you came from."
14113.0,Patient,"Okay Okay, I never heard that one I like that."
740.0,Provider,So that's my non judgmental opinion.
14113.0,Patient,"Okay, I was just honest I was just curious kind of like all right, what if I do, I was, I guess, a yearly asking like let's say get on the other side of the Rainbow. My head okay. Good and everything Jana go back to him, I should have been more clear, I know I know he was talking about that's why I say."
740.0,Provider,"He will cause you to regress them for you, causing the progress because it's hard and it's very difficult to bring somebody to a place that they never experienced, but they can always take you back to when you came from."
14113.0,Patient,"I even had a friend asked me, is he going to therapy for his insecurities and I went I don't know and I don't. Know probably a bad habits."
740.0,Provider,"And defects and all this kind of stuff has he healed from all the other stuff yeah you know it just a lot. Because the thing about it is, and I guess the thing that bothered me the most when you said that he was like well i'm. You know, you need to get yourself together cuz i'm hurting and i'm like well that that right there that right there is automatic it's because you're not taking accountability and responsibility for your actions. As if you were the one."
14113.0,Patient,Exactly and that.
740.0,Provider,"And do a little victimized. As if you were the one who was doing the other day, and he was the one that was getting victim."
14113.0,Patient,"And that's how it felt like Indian and that's why I was pissing in after like a month, they started realizing I was like. i'm sort of. It started to come off like i'm The only problem here like I only did everything wrong I was like when really it was also him, but the way he's working everything and what he's telling James was like it's almost as if it was him. Like you weren't in a relationship by yourself, neither was I are together. It was you, too, I don't just get mad wake up one morning yeah it's a beautiful day to be a bitch oh i'm just going to treat you like crap today it's like. No, you gave me a reason, and I would always tell me if someone gives me a reason to be mean to them or be rude or pop back. i'm gonna do the same back i'm like I don't just wake up one morning and decide to be mean. I was like Matthew give me reasons, give me reasons, and the reason why I get so mad right off the BAT is because i've told you this 800 times before, and it's like you don't listen like you do the same thing again and again and again, knowing how it gets me. I don't do the things you told me to do, and if I do them they're like once in a blue moon i'll forget good question so anyways yeah yeah. i'm going to keep all that in mind. And i'm going to think of one I need to call her because I just haven't told her she'll send me things on tick tock left and right, left and right, left and right and like reply like. The most what hasn't called me I haven't called her obviously my roommate and live with us the whole time so. i'm going to definitely keep that in mind and. Just sucks. I don't like it. At all i'm just i'm, to the point where like. I, and I know sounds so oh me corny but I don't want to be with anybody anymore, but the other half is me of me is like no, I want to be with somebody so damn bad."
740.0,Provider,"No, I want to be."
14113.0,Patient,"But the other half is like. No like i'm done getting her i'm done being told lies i'm done with this i'm done with that, like, here we go another heartbreak another fail i'm just so. i'm so tired of it so so sick and tired of i'm just mentally and emotionally just drained and going off of empty, you know but i'm still trying to put my all out there and. i'm learning as I go, of course, i'm definitely trying to learn as I go, I will say. Some of the techniques that I told myself i'm learning from that I didn't use them in this, this relationship which that's my fault but it's it's. Because i'm just forgetting, who I am half the time you know to mean and not self loving you know and knowing my boundaries so and that's something that is one of the biggest things that i'm still trying to do for my soul and it's hard so."
740.0,Provider,"Well, until next time."
14113.0,Patient,"ready, I have to call make appointments for. So do that. Okay, was always, thank you for everything."
740.0,Provider,Absolutely.
