416.0,Provider,"Oh okay well so you've had a big move. yeah oh alright and and so today where i'm Julie hi. Even were scheduled for what we call bio psychosocial what. fancy way of saying that I need to ask you a lot of questions, just to get to know you a little bit and and maybe set some goals with you about how we want to move forward if that sounds okay. yep yep alright so let's start with um I did read the notes that chantelle took when she met with you. So I kind of have an I have an idea and I saw your your survey scores, too, so I see that you have definitely pretty high depression and fairly high anxiety and I saw some notes about ptsd and that sort of thing. what's important for me to know about that, what can you share with me like when you got those diagnoses originally and where they come from."
13888.0,Patient,"yeah I got diagnosed. With ptsd. The first time. 2000 6016. By a therapist I was seeing an order to have gender firming top surgery. And then, for the second time in 2018 for my therapist after. My mom passed away. yeah. yeah what was the what was the other question about."
416.0,Provider,"So what are the things that sort of brought you to bright heart what are, what are the things you want to be able to work on, while you're here."
13888.0,Patient,"yeah i'm definitely the depression and just being able to like I find it really hard to leave the House a lot of the time I, for some reason I don't really find it a hard. To like. Go to work, but I do. Typically, take. More time off, and I will, I would like to take off."
416.0,Provider,Mental like sick time yeah.
13888.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. and When i'm not and when i'm not during work hours like on the weekends or evenings I find it really, really difficult just to leave the House. And I just. I feel like I am like I have a partner, and I feel like. And this has happened in several of my last relationships, where it's like I. I reached a certain point of connecting and then I just. feel nothing and just wait for the for the relationship to die basically."
416.0,Provider,really good that you're able to express that okay.
13888.0,Patient,yeah we'd like to work on those things.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so chantelle put you on some I see you have some anti anxiety staff and some. And some antidepressants next in. So good okay when did your your deep depression stuff start when did you first remember having that."
13888.0,Patient,"At the time I was 17 for sure, but i'm pretty sure it started before then I can't remember a lot of that because that was very traumatic time in my family. So I don't have a lot of memories of before them but i'm pretty sure. It started sometime in depression started sometime in junior high and by the time I was 1617 years rebuilding."
416.0,Provider,And you tell me a little bit about your family who who where did you grow up and who did you grow up with.
13888.0,Patient,I grew up in yuba city um I grew up with my mom and my dad my three older brothers um.
416.0,Provider,How would you characterize that house.
13888.0,Patient,"what's it like in their hair had pretty bad tempers but they mostly had tempers just at each other, and so we I experience, just like mostly neglect. type of stuff I never, especially as the youngest I didn't brunt a lot of that anger myself, I did. Experience I was home schooled most of my life and I experienced my mom having a really, really deep depression as well, were you know she couldn't get out of bed a lot. and My older brother and in when I was so that was the middle brother. When I was in junior high he was just finishing high school and. This huge story broke about how his English teacher. Had. an inappropriate relationship with him. And because. It was a female teacher and a male student. My family got a lot of brunt of what was obviously his fault."
416.0,Provider,it's her fault you mean.
13888.0,Patient,His fault.
416.0,Provider,You see it as your brother's fault.
13888.0,Patient,"No, no, the Community did the."
416.0,Provider,"Community side is your brother's fault. Right. right, of course, they course not that he was a kid or anything yeah right."
13888.0,Patient,"Exactly, not the view is a minor, not that this was completely inappropriate and it turned out during the court case that she had been dismissed from another position for doing the exact same thing."
416.0,Provider,So there were a lot of ramifications for your whole family home that like are you guys a little bit ostracized or what happened.
13888.0,Patient,"yeah ostracized and then my brother kind of. started doing. Drugs, and you know started doing heavier drugs and harder drugs and was in and out of rehab and my parents kind of poured. All of their time and energy into him. to the point where, after my my next oldest brother and I got into college they ended up apologizing to us. For. Not being around for high school. But then right around the same time as that apology happened, I came out and was immediately told that if I was going to. be able to come home after I finished college, and that was about two months down the pipeline from when I came out. That I was going to have to go to conversion therapy."
416.0,Provider,Oh wow okay. And did they make you do that. You had to go to conversion therapy.
13888.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I had sorry.
13888.0,Patient,"I had to drive myself up to oroville. twice a week and then, once a month for like eight months. and go to this particular therapist at this particular church. up there."
416.0,Provider,Oh God even I am so sorry that isn't I we don't even claim therapists like that that's horrible.
13888.0,Patient,"yeah kind of stuff but in a weird way it kind of. helped. Because, at the end of eight months I finally realized that. They weren't finding anything. Therefore it wasn't broken."
416.0,Provider,"Oh alright, so you took the best possible message away from that right like yeah listen you guys i'm not broken I can't be fixed I don't need to be fixed."
13888.0,Patient,"Nothing to fix them there's nothing to fix. And I am i'm done with you poking around on my psyche. And then. In 2016 like I said I was gone to another therapist and they. diagnosed me with the depression and the ptsd i've been trying to get that diagnosis, for a while. But because. The only way that i've learned how to survive, is by being overly positive I kept getting therapists who. were saying no you're not depressed no you don't have that you felt, you know you. Just because I know how to talk about what's going on for me doesn't mean that I don't experience. The emotions that i'm talking about. And then in 2017 I had the surgery, and my mom was really sick at the time with triple negative breast breast cancer and I didn't know this until the following, you may some may 2018 but she wrote a clause in the will. That. says that if I ever come out or change my like genders. Publicly or legally then i'm written out of the world. So my dad is. Very much still. In the mind to uphold that."
416.0,Provider,"OK. Are your parents affiliated with a particular church, are they very religious."
13888.0,Patient,"they're very religious they haven't really been a part of a particular church. they've been a part of different churches, they were kind of a part of a house church thing in the 80s late 70s i'm with my mom's family. And that course sort of fell apart, and then we moved away. But only like an hour and a half away. From my dad teaching jobs and then. I was basically raised up there are really rather. You city."
416.0,Provider,"I mean I, I know that area pretty well because I grew up in Chico so I cannot begin to."
13888.0,Patient,single springs the foothills. I mean.
416.0,Provider,Those are not those are not. areas that are pretty but that are overly accepting of. Any kind of diversity. I bet that was hard.
13888.0,Patient,yeah I think I. I didn't even know what gay was until I was in college so.
416.0,Provider,Where do you go to college.
13888.0,Patient,I went to point loma nazarene University in San Diego.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, and how was that experience."
13888.0,Patient,"Though when I was going there because I transferred in as like the sophomore i'm. More my senior year the spiritual head. Which is a student. elected position came out publicly and then the entire campus erupted. We had lectures about how you're going to go to hell and other lectures were didn't you know that didn't. That was that it was totally fine and. I was also already struggling. And so I had already gone to the chaplain, and so I was having weekly weekly meetings with the chaplain trying to figure out. My sexuality and being told, basically, what I grew up with being told was you know gay people were evil and. were broken and blah blah blah, this is before conversion therapy. And then my beliefs, which were self deprecating and self loathing and home, you know internally homophobic we're being taken and used against the. spiritual head. student. As like you're clearly delusional because there's there's other student there's a saying that you do so this is big coal messy thing."
416.0,Provider,"Oh OK. OK so and then you said, your mom passed away in 2018 is that what I heard."
13888.0,Patient,yeah February 2018.
416.0,Provider,sorry about that.
13888.0,Patient,"My dad and I were her full time caregivers I was also doing my first year of teaching and trying to finish a credential program which I didn't finish. And I wish I could say why. yeah I was the only one home when well wasn't alone home, but I was only the only one, with her when she died."
416.0,Provider,And even What do you do for work now.
13888.0,Patient,I work at a school and a junior high with kids with. Moderate to profound disabilities.
416.0,Provider,And what do you do for them.
13888.0,Patient,i'm just one of the AIDS in the room.
416.0,Provider,Do you do like a like a BA.
13888.0,Patient,"BA BA. BA BA was sometimes mostly I just do whatever the teacher tells me to. i've been. A teacher i've also been a teacher and a special ED classroom. But i'm also trying to. continue a master's program for degree and a master's in history, with emphasis and curriculum development, so I figured I didn't want the stress of being the actual teacher and."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
13888.0,Patient,But I had back surgery in April and it's turning out to be kind of difficult on my back Beatrix Cooley down. I can hear on a truck over there. yeah my service dog.
416.0,Provider,Is she a actual service dog.
13888.0,Patient,"I changed her and she passed her tests, yes she's an actual so."
416.0,Provider,Today we're kind of diversity.
13888.0,Patient,she's sharp punk becoming.
416.0,Provider,"Let me see you gorgeous Oh, my goodness, you could not be but you're just perfection. And that little wagging the tail yes. So, are you currently enrolled on the master's Program."
13888.0,Patient,Good.
416.0,Provider,Okay got a lot going on.
13888.0,Patient,"yeah so, then I had to have back surgery, I was walking with a Walker I got diagnosed with fibromyalgia in March found out, I had to have back surgery at the end of March, had back surgery first week of April. yeah and then. Had summer. My partner i'd already known my partner like online, but we actually met for the first time in June. And then i'm here. where they live. have my own place I work at the school and I just finished moving about a week ago. I actually moved in about three days."
416.0,Provider,"So you're. You and your partner don't live together, but you're nearby what i'm hearing. yeah yeah awesome and what you said you would characterize that relationship generally is healthy, but then now you're in this kind of weird place where you're starting to find some apathy."
13888.0,Patient,And I felt myself do this before. I haven't really been in a relationship since before my mom passed away.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13888.0,Patient,I just don't get it.
416.0,Provider,"Well it's pretty hard to get close to someone under those circumstances I mean it sounds like a kind of a natural protective mechanism of your brain to be like, oh no, no, no, this is going to cause you pain."
13888.0,Patient,"yeah and it just. I don't know, I have a lot of like and I don't know if it's just because of all the trauma around my sexuality, I just have I mean, I have a lot of like. A sexual tendencies. That tend to get but then, at the same time and, and the reason I brought it up was I don't think it's just a sexuality, I think it's like still layers of internalized homophobia, because it only happens. It gets worse as a relationship go on. And that seems suspect to me."
416.0,Provider,"yeah it does to me too. And we're not going to really know until we kind of dig through some of that stuff right. But um but yeah it from what you're telling me I I hear more attachment stuff than I do kind of natural asexuality, although that may be a factor to who knows."
13888.0,Patient,yeah and I think I think two of the medications are more than i'm on lower your sex drive which doesn't really help my case but.
416.0,Provider,"They they can they don't do it to everybody, but they can. yeah yeah for sure mm hmm. But yeah we can definitely talk about that, I mean all of it is connected right all this stuff this the trauma that you've had. The fighting that wasn't directed at you, but I can imagine impacted you from an early age between your parents your mother's death your both of your parents reaction to who your you and your authentic self and. And, and the way the Church has reacted I mean all of it is sort of like. it's all connected right, I mean, how would you have learned how to trust. and get be able to feel emotionally close or even physically and sexually close to someone. Under those circumstances that makes a lot of sense."
13888.0,Patient,hang on one second izzy stopping. The cat is grouping up a chair.
416.0,Provider,"Oh kitty cats. yeah so. So there's definitely a lot to work on, I think, and so even what's your, what is your school schedule like. I mean not like not you in school, but your."
13888.0,Patient,works yeah they changed my hours to a 15 it was a 25 shows really excited if 15 to 3045.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so if we put you into a group at four o'clock did you would that be realistic, for you, I know you don't like the four o'clock thing but."
13888.0,Patient,be about five minutes late.
416.0,Provider,that's okay.
13888.0,Patient,buddy that's okay that's fine yeah that's good.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean yeah you have like a 10 minute window So if you can get in before then that would be. Fine, and."
13888.0,Patient,Give me about 10 minutes to get home typically get out to my car about 350. So.
416.0,Provider,"I want to look into who's in that group, so this is a group. That is chantel and I are both we co facilitate this, I do miss the facilitating and then she does the. The MED checks and all of that, in the group, although she sometimes facilitates it too. And I have a have a lot of groups. And i've been wanting to do like a trans non binary group, but I haven't pulled it together to do that yet would be super cool to do that. But so far in the group's. To the best of my knowledge, everyone has been incredibly accepting and everybody works really hard to use correct pronouns. So um I mean people might screw it up here and there, I just want to see who's in your this group that i'm proposing for you just to make sure that this is a good one for you hold on, let me look at the 10th so I can't see you for half a second because i'm looking at another screen. So if i'm making really funny faces that you know I okay um. Oh. yeah actually there is There is one other person in there who's non binary. and uses Bay pronouns. And yeah it's a mix, but I think you would be very welcomed and safe there. And so it would be Thursdays at four if that works for you."
13888.0,Patient,yeah like I said i'm going to sleep that's right then yeah that's totally.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'll make sure that you get assigned to that group and that you get the information on how to login and everything, and so, even through all of this has it and have you had any suicidal thoughts or ideations or attempts."
13888.0,Patient,yeah not recently but. Think 2016 was my last. attempt i've had four attempts since. 2009. And 10 one and 2009 had one in 2011 I had one in 2012. And then I wanted 2016.
416.0,Provider,And were you hospitalized for them.
13888.0,Patient,"know, everybody acted like they didn't happen. And the ones, when I was at college, I was put on a list and then would have iras that were you know, a year older than you Robin by room checking on you every two hours with no real direction, other than to make sure that you are still alive."
416.0,Provider,"How even every time I think we've come so far I hear a story from you, this is horrible i'm so sorry you've had these experiences. And then your attempts, did you have where they kind of spur the moment or had you did you have plans."
13888.0,Patient,"No, it tended to be when my depression would just get too overwhelming. And I just couldn't. anymore, and it was like weeks and weeks of after I couldn't anymore."
416.0,Provider,"yeah okay. And, did you did you overdose how did what was your method."
13888.0,Patient,"yeah typically overdose tried once with a razor blade. But didn't cut very far before it was interrupted. or very deeply. But typically China overdose. yeah and then I we haven't even gotten to this point, but after my mom died I got. cut off from all my medications I lost my insurance, so I didn't have any medications I didn't have any. of my pain medication. And I didn't have because I have endometriosis and. No muscle relaxant nothing and then my mom died and I started drinking pretty heavily after I lost my job. My mom died in February I lost my job in. June early June, and then by November. I was drinking too much and then in February of 2020 I finally got into a psychiatrist which i'd never seen before um no I had seen one before but they didn't. treat me with anything that I felt like working. And they made me feel like they didn't believe half of the things that I was saying, I was feeling. And it was not a good fit finally got into a psychiatrist that I really liked and she said Okay, if you can stop drinking for the next two weeks I won't give you any medication if you're drinking. I have an idea about what would be good for you, and so I did and ever since then i've been on the soul loft. And the quantity."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you feel like that's that's helping. Oh yeah okay okay good. Okay, any in addition to the alcohol, did you do any drug. experimentation or issues."
13888.0,Patient,Only when I tried to overdose okay.
416.0,Provider,Do you so you mentioned some pain medication you mentioned muscle relaxers what What else do you have for pain that you take regularly.
13888.0,Patient,"I have a prescription of tylenol number three and for my period I don't have enough. I only have enough to last me for my period it's like 20 pills, or something like that. Anyway, it only lasts for seven days and if I use it any other time that I don't have enough for my period and that's all."
416.0,Provider,In there what's the plan for treatment for the endometriosis is there is there anything on the horizon that's more permanent than just addressing the pain.
13888.0,Patient,"Not at this point. I just got diagnosed with fibromyalgia in March, and then I moved up here, so I haven't been able to find. A local PCP or."
416.0,Provider,chantelle can help with that.
13888.0,Patient,Oh cool.
416.0,Provider,"I mean, she should be she I know she treats other patients with fibromyalgia or I believe she does If not, then, we do have you could you could always have a pain Doc look at you, you know near you but. We have pain docs on staff as well, I don't know who's licensed in Oregon, but we do have pain docs awesome yeah so. Okay um so that's kind of something that you're just living with right now yeah yeah all right. Okay, so we covered drugs and alcohol, so when you think back to your childhood is there, I know you said there's big chunks that you can't remember. You mentioned the fighting between your parents, what about child abuse or a neglect, like any sexual abuse or physical abuse emotional abuse, I could argue that it's emotional abuse to."
13888.0,Patient,"yeah emotional abuse definitely my mom was really, really. Emotionally manipulative and very. um yeah and then I got. sexually assaulted when I was four, five and then again when I was seven and then again when I was eight by three different people. i'm. All over these all under. 16 years of age, one of them was a kid that was only two years older than me when I was five. And then, one of them. Was sort of set the eight year old was it was a kid that was 10 most like a corporation, and they were like. selling tickets basically to the other kids at the place school and. yeah I can't remember much more than that, when I was like in."
416.0,Provider,The deer did. You ever tell anybody about these things do you feel safe.
13888.0,Patient,They were all Christian therapists who are looking for. reasons why it was so it didn't really go anywhere productive. and And then my oldest brother. When I was. The oldest. turn the.
416.0,Provider,key message as well.

13888.0,Patient,i'm. Not that i'm aware of. And remember.
416.0,Provider,"But I mean at least there's that so the. With with some child protective services ever involved in your life. And um. So let's see what who would you consider right now like, as part of your your like social support network your community."
13888.0,Patient,um my partner our mutual friend Danny my cousin Lacey my sister in law Rebecca. My old pastor. i'm not like old like just from. previous years. I started going to a UCC up in loomis that was. asked by a gay man and just been transformative for me.

And and and then any like legal issues or financial issues that you're facing."

416.0,Provider,"And are you being like threatened with affection, or I mean any."

All of my. Like pressures in my head and everything we're off, which was making me so sick and it was from that injury.
