14822.0,Patient,"At first it was you know.

This look me up with HR and then she was just telling me, you know, will give you these days off and go find something and I was getting ready to go, I was falling around with places I try to get in some places that i've gone to before, but this is a new insurance so. i'm kind of their faces. was almost going to this one we had and they told me to get up hold for some reason, get older someone else or something I was bored but then that leaves me with this pace, you know there's a new program we're going through the hospital and it was through she worked at a hospital. social worker there. Okay, so are."
724.0,Provider,You going after here.
14822.0,Patient,"Okay yeah all right, my name is bad i'm not sure what. So medical Center and. I was at first, I was like no I wasn't wanting to because of the treatment centers I was on suboxone taper down within like a week. And that's what I wanted to do because I wasn't wanting to be on spot I didn't because i've heard about methadone and I heard about people doing so long and boring. Like yeah being on it for so long, so in my mind now nothing against that, but for me personally, I was like no, I want to. and The King was like man I don't want to be done, all the other 30 days at the same time. and but either way my girlfriend and I was asking her what do you think what do you think of shoes sounding whatever she would have liked for me to say Oh, she was she didn't say that she goes wherever you feel like you want to do with you know view so. More by the as the time went on within that day I made up my mind, but I was taught that between the two resident residential box. So I just want to. stay. With the format, I mean pretty good considering you know."
724.0,Provider,"yeah the suboxone programs when you when you use them appropriately they're really, really good and quite effective and. manageable to taper off, you know and complete. I understand what you're saying about the methadone and the goal method on it like it would initially came out was. Excuse me to get people, stable and then they got to a point when they when they achieved like they're stable dose was like a lot of milligrams astronomy like they start people off methodology on like day one it's like 40. And then, by like the fifth day, you know that, like 90 or hundred 20 and when I lived in Florida in Florida is like crazy crazy numbers like 300 milligrams a day i've seen like crazy numbers so. yeah trying to come up with numbers like that, where you taper like one one or two milligrams every every week you're looking at a 10 year plan and it's like no way no way. yeah."
14822.0,Patient,"I started to I remember seeing that pill epidemic being where there was like that was like the last date for that to be in the medical like files or whatever, like, I remember people hearing people going to Florida, because it was so. pain management like facilities everywhere getting prescriptions and it's an opiate side are like i'm like man."
724.0,Provider,"that's really what what started the methadone clinic that I worked at we literally shared a parking lot would pay advantage of a clinic so like I could walk out the front door of the medical billing. And then walk. A single parking lot you know what I mean a single parking area, and then a space where people came in and then the next parking area single row in that building it was like a horseshoe building like we literally shared you know patients on it was Florida was the Wild West. that's all yeah he was like the Wild West."
14822.0,Patient,All right.
724.0,Provider,"So yeah but the suboxone program is a lot better and. More selfish and when we use that program it was really designed for people that you know, to put it frankly like really had their shit together for the most part, you know what I mean like they didn't need. Daily dose and when they physically had a come into the building a dose because they had. So much other on stability or instability in their personal life they weren't working they didn't have a support network, they were homeless and all these things it's like. We are for sure not going to give you a controlled substance of it, let you take that on your own for five days straight and not be tempted to sell it that'd be tempted the to abuse it so that's a sponsor program is really. reserved for people that. are on the right path you know what I mean so."
14822.0,Patient,"that's how that's how I see seeing this one really like this, like a lot of people, but I like how you just explain it it's really bad for."
724.0,Provider,"people that have like like stable environmental factors I was always. Criteria it's like is this person working or not they're like no it's like they're not giving up suboxone now, because what I can let them pay his rent. You know we're not gonna let her pay or read you know with the medication it's a controlled substance the DEA would have a real hard time coming after doctors and stuff like that so. You know people that are good, you know they got it. and your dose to taper off what are you at with your dose."
14822.0,Patient,And Maxwell. six.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so I like that number that you know the mental gymnastics that one play to you know with ourselves, like 12 is not a big number, you know you can literally taper off 12. You know, and a small window, you know what I mean like that's an easy worked out so don't get attached to the numbers don't get attached to. You know, thinking that you're gonna have to be on it forever because that's not the case at all it's a box it's really, really good, and you can really. Self manage your protocol, you know as you see fit, so if you if you decided that you're like hey I don't take 1212 a day and I take it. will say hypothetically three times a day you know if it was me I would. Take that initial dose and then I would push that second dose see how long I could go today like before it starts giving me a hard time if I could push it out if I normally take it at noon. i'll shoot for 1230 see if I get the last till 1230 without taking it. and get the 1230, but I feel pretty good 130 we'll see what happens at 130 I feel pretty good just keep doing that, and if you hit a wall we're like. Okay now experiencing the withdrawals I don't feel good, even if I was a little anxious i'd like. 15 more minutes let's see what happens I would constantly doing it and, eventually, you would see over time that window would change like I don't longer have to take it three times a day I take it twice a day. And i'm going to take. X amount instead of where I normally take and like you can really manage that and measure that within like you know week sometimes like if you have like good discipline and a good. journal that you're keeping track your numbers like you could really get invested in. Like managing a protocol and a lot of people do a lot of people that I dealt with Iran suboxone typically get on suboxone or methadone you know what I mean and. Within 45 days or dod you know because they were really already in the right headspace and be like i'm done with this, you know my. build a support network identified triggers I got some some decent coping skills now i've been through some shit and i'm ready to go and they're really motivated and taper and Adonis like later. See you around hopefully I don't See you in this setting on, and so it is a good protocol, I like it, I think I think most people should probably be on it, if they have all the other things in place, because it really is beneficial. yeah um how long you been using opiates for."
14822.0,Patient,"pain medicine, it was it out, they. said when I started seven games, no, no good school.

And he just sounded real calm and chill and he looked like it sounds good sounds like. tramadol and i've always heard mixed thing about them at all those don't do that stuff like that, but um when I took them I took five of them that's so crazy think about that nowadays it's like you know take take."

So I just tell people like the universal precautions that even if it's from somebody that you trust just assume that it has fighting on it and take less you know take less than what you normally would because that's the safest bet. That you could have. Is there's there's no guarantee, I had a patient whose daughter was 19 years old, good kid college went to a party sniffed a lot of cocaine did.

So I go out there and Lo and behold, is a guy he looked like barney purple so purple a barney like on the site like either side of his car. And some random person doing chest compressions autumn, and then the kid obviously was his dad he's a mass he's all upset it's like I recognize him from from the program and so that this is all bad and. Yet they're already working on the call title one when fire department got there, and he Ms I was like. about and I walked back up and I just like shook my head was like nope not gonna make it no. He was. 50 shades of purple I was like oh he'd been he'd been like unconscious for a long time, I was like I don't know he was he did come back it was gonna be good for like so probably not a good day it's everywhere so.

14822.0,Patient,"Yes, the reason why I feel like I relax this because I don't know me and the reaction is I might have even over pause. You know the philosophy withdraw from them and stuff like that I know. there's any new lead, and this, they were explaining you know Take your time your some time to break your brain, you know here's your for. All those. receptors or whatever keen on the kind of held back and start feeling good again and it's just. i've done these before. i've got all the way up to the 12 step and I just I needed to get a fancy. And that's, the only thing I didn't complete I was chairing a meeting and I was doing all that that whole time just. Not wanting to do it so bad, but I was just like man I don't know what else you I haven't I mean i've been a rehab five four time at that time. or five I can't remember what time it was I was like and I never tried these meeting, so let me just try this so I went there on the sponsor work the steps and stuff like that. They were just saying make yourself filming and don't feel like me, being a feminist when I was doing that i'm doing it for nine months. After nine months I just stopped at all. stopped going, and then I just always noticed like get down like I was saying, oh going in anything. So that I mean pretty much any not talking to you know not talking it's like how we're doing now or talking anybody even my girlfriend I was just keep the things that I felt."
724.0,Provider,"Isolated yeah yeah. yeah so I mean what happens with. Like your long term happy neural transmitter the hormone is serotonin most of its 90% of it's located in your stomach so if you're not taking care of yourself there. Right, the other 10% is the dope me, which is like your are not 10% don't means its own has its own hundred percent but don't mean as the the short term happy neurotransmitter that's what you get from getting high that's what you get from you know catching the winning. touchdown in a football game it's the instant reward factor right. problem opiates and like a lot of drugs is that those drugs will hijack that reward system and. it'll be a long time before it relinquishes complete control over it, and because we have natural Ob receptors in our body your play video games. Like HALO or know that. Now, well, you get what they call it like it like in those first person shooter games you like an over shield and then you have your health right your health bar or the over shield. And all this damage before your real health starts to go down and that's what the opiate receptors in your body are like. it's your body's early alert warning system that something is wrong physically so like your Stub your toe really bad and the pain is like instant you're like ah shit this hurts so bad sucks you ever broken a bone, though."
14822.0,Patient,yeah it's like but.
724.0,Provider,"But if you're awake but if you're awake, for you know what I mean so like. So, like say you Stub your toe and you're like ah that sucks but so you somebody told you break your toe it doesn't really hurt, but your brain kicks in and it's like oh."
14822.0,Patient,something's wrong and not.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's not just it just doesn't hurt it like this thing this isn't good. So it's early in your early alert system so it's like the telling the difference between being hurt being injured. And when you're and you can get away with a lot of stuff when you're hurt, because just paying right when you're Angela you're like Okay, like you, broke your foot you can't walk out it, though. yeah so the body's gonna let you go that's out of commission so that's that's part of your that's part of your pain receptor so, then what happens with narcotics, is that you take them. You think of like like a like a wine cup right that's what it looks like right, so the pain comes in and it fills up that code. And then, it just stays in the cup perfect doesn't poor over not at the stage of the cup doesn't go anywhere and you're like shit this sucks. You take a narcotic that narcotic comes in it's a blue overfill is that copied it just pours out and you're like. Well, I don't feel pain anymore, and then I feel amazing this is awesome like. Like i'm not paying close before been injured, I know what that's like so it's like yeah I could see why people get hooked to this feeling I remember having that thought is like an 18 year old like Oh, I can see why rock stars like this shit. You just like. So I was like okay so, then what So what do you think happens with the body, the body is like. When you broke your foot, but now you're all these payments, you can feel that and now you're trying to run a triathlon like what are we doing. it's like trying to run, so what happens is boop boop another receptor comes up right because it's going to. scoop all the leftover stuff fill that cup and then you're cool, which is why, would you take what you took yesterday. i'm not getting the same effect it's like what happened yesterday I got super I today i'm like whatever I gotta take more and it fills up and it pours out, so the body's like Okay, we can't keep doing this, but we will for a little bit lupu. build another one, and then another one, and then another one, which is why you see people's like like tolerance for aggression, they they have to take more to achieve their desired high. More more more cups cups cups of markups and eventually you hit like a like a ceiling effect right where your body's just can't produce anymore, and I just got a whole bunch of pain receptors were there shouldn't be that many. Right, so when you get high, but when you think you get hired you take whatever you take you don't get the euphoria anymore you just get enough so you don't get dope sick you just feel normal. What happens when you don't do that. yep the COPs are like Oh, we don't have to do this anymore we're not getting any more pills in so we can start dying off and getting back to a baseline well what happens when this happens. dope dope dope second it's like I don't like this feeling I get high again and you're just because we see here."
14822.0,Patient,What is it called when your body's trying to get valid what's that word or. homeostasis yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So it could never get there right because it's always like. On so that's why everything hurts way more than it should. Do he's got way more patients that you shouldn't so it's like. Everything sucks right, so I get it. So what happens with the you know the buprenorphine suboxone that comes in it fills up the cup there's no overflow and there's no euphoria. But it's like all right, this is cool it's a low dose and maybe this much of the surface is leftover well if this much can die off and not make you sick you feel okay. You know you're not 100% but you're like 96% and your functional it's like cool now those receptors can start getting smaller over time and then you get back to a baseline because your body needs to know when it's injured and when it's hurt that's why the receptors are there. And that's how the pain receptors it was explained to me by a doctor I don't know it sounds like a lot of bro science, but it made sense to me. And that's what it is and in the process of all those things diet off your dope I mean it's like shot, you know what I mean like you will have a hard time finding joy in anything because right now you're just internally in your homeostasis being crazy. you're miserable you know so that's not an uncommon side of. It will post acute withdrawal symptoms so. don't take offense but. You know it's it's not a special side effect. You know it's something that a lot of people will have to deal with. As they get back to a baseline right. Because you went from having so much of it all the time. But not having barely any of course there's going to be like I. Just as high as ever, says the fall is even further, you know what I mean so it'll take a while to get back up to a baseline and you will you know it just takes a little bit and and trying. holistic stuff on your own. Well, we on a nature getting vitamin D exercise and getting good sleep having meaningful relationships all those things will help bring joy back into your love for your life and trick your your mental health in the working like it should. don't rely on people to make you happy."
14822.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's. Another thing, while I was like I don't want it same thing with suffice it sounds like I still have to rely on something happened with the pharmacy. But I. guess my focus on."
724.0,Provider,"suboxone. And i'm not a huge pharmacologist guy like I don't really think that. Like overprescribing people every time they have an auchi or you know if shit it's hard for them in their personal life. i'm kind of hard in that respect, where i'm like yeah life is hard you know you should feel upset when your girlfriend dumps you, you should feel upset about the check or get fired from a job, like we shouldn't nerve and round all the edges in the world, because people's."
14822.0,Patient,feelings.
724.0,Provider,"are sensitive now there are people that definitely need it, you know what I mean like there's there's a there's a world where that exists to but for me. Working in this business i'm like. What do you suffer from and they tell me that my you know the cowboy. Up to catch up a little bit. But the suboxone is, if you look at it it's it's a medical device or assistance that's going to bring you back down to a baseline and then you're not going to need it anymore. Where some of those other medications are long term or life term right this thing is a very temporary substitute for that thing that used to take. And now it's going to clear, you have that that burden it just takes a little while and then, when it's done it's like a friend that doesn't doesn't want anything were returned it's this article you good later. it's just going to take off it's actually make you pay for anything later down the road. that's what's the box, it does for people. You know, if you want like a long term friendship with somebody methadone or. suboxone suboxone."
14822.0,Patient,"yeah I like. To like because that's how I look at it like when. I explain that to I mean you know when you experience something negative, you know just take it that's supposed to have in like that's how i've been looking at a to another thing that's why I see what people don't know about addiction. I could see what they mean it's like they don't want to they don't want they want to be like that you know they don't want to get better and like it's not a disease and stuff like that that's why I was always kind of on the fence about the disease thing because it's like it's a choice. it's. It."
724.0,Provider,"can be both you know what I mean it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive, one that people like titles right. And that's fine if that works through that works through the problem addiction to and again, like many things. Is that when you're on narcotics, for a long period of time. And life happens during that period of time. You don't develop any coping skills to deal with. The sadness or anxiety. Because you're. you're essentially nerf out it's like I don't feel shit I don't feel anything so it's like my dog died it's like I guess that said. Or you lost your job today it's like Okay, I like that job anyway, you know what I mean like you just. Use your feelings have been blunted and now that people aren't on those drugs anymore. And those events happen, they don't know how to cope with that, because what they're used to is not feeling anything at all, and now they're just overwhelmed with feeling and they don't know how to address that So then, what do they do that default is like. i'm just gonna get high because I don't want to deal with this right, but then this causes like secondary issues and that's why like when they tell people like. You know what age, did you start using it's like 14 and it's like oh you're essentially your grains a 14 year old then now now you're 28 you're sober. Like we generally the emotional maturity of a 14 year old like I don't know if it's approved by sides, but some of that is accurate, because it means that I did develop certain coping skills in that. During that that period of time that I should have and now struggling as an adult because I should be cowboy this shit up but I. But I can't because I don't know how to cobble yet, but you have to learn those things you know it's just like anything else, like trial and error and, as you learn those things, and you experienced them directly or instead of indirectly you're going to perform better. But you'll get there, too, so we always tell people that like not trying to like get stone cold sober when like their personal life or their environmental factors is a total mess, either because it's like that's not going to end well for you either you know what I mean like. So yeah but you'll get back to finding self worth and value in life and hobbies and stuff like that you just allow your body to catch up and then you're going to cheat you know in certain ways like like I said sleep and exercise are huge for depression. Huge for like the replacement adult meaning of the body. If you're staying up till four o'clock in the morning playing video games and sleeping. For three hours, of course, you know your brain is going to be like we are in Austin you know what I mean so little things like that will help reassure eating right helps for sure. If 90% of your serotonin is located your gut bacteria and you're eating pasta and fast food all the time yeah you're going to feel like a fat slob you know what I mean like."
14822.0,Patient,that's what I heard when I was in the last three have this lady would come over to talk about your your like she was almost saying like your gut is like your second brain.
724.0,Provider,Science things that it might be the first brain.
14822.0,Patient,"yeah crazy hearing that But then when she goes and explains, it is like you know that makes sense that's why, when I got back, we have, I did like a three day cleanse of like celery it sound like that, and I did that, and I was doing a lot of juicing. Because that's I felt like I relaxed, because all my I was just didn't feel nothing and i'm like you know what I need to eat all this stuff so I could help that and I was signing now is exercising murphy's and I was my body was saying that and everything else pretty good. yeah and."
724.0,Provider,"What it's hard like we don't. want to kill each other, like eating healthy and working out. it's hard work it's a lifetime commitment that it's it's hard to commit this would be like I gotta do this every day. or four days a week for the rest of my life and it's like I want to have fun, I want to eat cheeseburgers you know i'm not totally opposing like trash once a while, but as long as you're not always. Training your body like crap. You know, occasionally it's okay to reward you know what I mean have a cheat day have a couple of cheat days work out all week and I had the weekends to kind of screw off whatever it is, you have to like everything else you have to strike balance in life right so. Finding that balance is important, but for a lot of people we just overindulge we have the access to it here this country and. We don't really take care of ourselves, we just assume that this pill here is this pill is going to make me happy and then I can continue to treating my body like shit all the time, but this pill is going to. Nothing ever fixes anybody it's nothing is that easy because, if it was i'd be out of a job. And they'd be. No, no, depression in this world there'd be no sad, this could be nothing you know what I mean, like everybody would all be the same. You know, they would they would put in the water and they'd start people do it doesn't exist really some of that stuff helps some people but it's not for the the vast majority of people that rely on it, because people are lazy and nobody wants a cowboy yep sometimes so. that's, why should be. Any history of self harm suicidal thoughts behavior."
14822.0,Patient,"And i've thought of life, all be better off here but. I never."
724.0,Provider,had an. Active plan. Those thoughts come from like being in a bad place kind of like we were talking about.
14822.0,Patient,"yeah. Just telling myself, I was never going to get out of this cycle. That wasn't working at the time I was living off of it. do this for you, clean your house or mow your lawn somebody's house man is using all that money to get out of this in time, like that are especially when i'm sick i'm like man i'm better off my here i'm always a point in my family stuff, but they were never let them yeah many."
724.0,Provider,"Any history of trauma physical abuse, sexual abuse."
14822.0,Patient,"The time yeah. I mean it would hit me like if I like bread company smoking or drinking do as I say, not as I do it because of me, you know it's not me kind of this. Like me and my arm or my sides, the baking soda can be doing but. Not just as you would come home and DVD for no reason."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, good. um. So the work is stable how's your House, is it stable like."

Like five. out that that. That good strong hated you know you see no i'm not going to grow up like it's."
724.0,Provider,Good yeah there's something to be said about resiliency that's that's impressive it's a it's an awesome human characteristic that's good.
14822.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,Then she she supporting your efforts here.
14822.0,Patient,"Yes. Yes, he is like kind of think about like if this was trying to do with me like if i'm looking at myself but i'm trying to how. Did I mean not that i'm I cuz i'm not even easier on everybody hands on her, but just knowing I come first, you know I need to get high, and then you get do what we want to do and stuff like that i've always had money to pay the bills and stuff like that, but. Everything know emotionally know cuz I could take a toll over time, you know you're not there for your partner and stuff like that just you know, but she just kind of stuck by me and then. Just are noticing a difference to me in this last relaxing cues it's like no she confronted me and not even in a bad way you know she just sat next to me and said they're doing all right, and people. Tell me, I told her and she just said, we could get through this stuff like that so it's pretty it's like you know because we kind of look at it that way, I don't know."
724.0,Provider,"it's awesome. All right, good all right well that's it for. The this assessment you have any legal issues I guess last question."

14822.0,Patient,"I guess about who would be the right person to talk to you about that. I need to know how the big above it's at work, but I was going over and look at work, and it was saying. I mean obviously illegal substances are not on the property or at you it's a random drug test base and. It said on there, you know, unless you have prescription stuff like that. But I mean I don't know I got tomorrow i'm gonna have to go over there and talk to HR because. It comes up as you're in business right."
724.0,Provider,"i'm not sure what it comes up in the panel, but if there was a question about what it was um. Since like a Gray area so. i'm not going to tell you one way or the other but. If I was prescribed medication my employer didn't need to know I wouldn't tell them. Because it's. My personal business. But. But if you, but if I again if I was taking that that medication and then I got randomly drug tested and it came up, I would just like well here's my prescription for it. There I mean."
14822.0,Patient,"It yeah that's how I want I mean i'm just kind of nervous cuz I mean we've tried for years and i'm going to be in this new position i'm going to I haven't started yet I was already in. Progress or I was already in the going to switch over. But then, all this happen, and then so when I do go back on site in any position i'm going to drive a. forklift and and then the next time physician offices driver front loader i'm going to drive that too so it's like and it says that they get tested more often, so I don't know if it pops up."

724.0,Provider,"yeah so she can tell us the prescriber you're gonna want to action tell. You can send her like a private chat and just see what she says. She might have more insight into it than I would, but if she does that, obviously, for you on your end HR would probably be like the best. yeah HR would be like the person that I would go to tell couldn't tell me anything if the prescriber was like yeah I have no clue that I would go to hr."
14822.0,Patient,And then it's California to you guys. If she over there.

All kinds of sizes. Right. But you don't have to leave the chat up like the old time so that that's how you would do it. So down at the bottom, where it says, who you're talking to so tomorrow it'll be shed tell you at the drop down box fine chantelle make sure it says privately and then. Type your thing if not it'll say to everyone, you know what I mean, like everyone in Vienna, you don't want that so find her data. And then, when you're done click on the arrow at the top, where it says chat. there's like a little drop down arrow close it out gone. cool."
