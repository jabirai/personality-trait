15031.0,Patient,Well that's that's pretty much what he does.
741.0,Provider,Okay that's fine. That is perfectly okay.
15031.0,Patient,i'm becoming a. becoming a pro at this aren't a.
741.0,Provider,"couple of housekeeping things that we need to talk about first. The first Okay, is it can be alone. In the room for an hour. Yes, Okay, the other question that I have is um does he have like headphones. No Okay, and the reason that i'm asking is that on Friday we're gonna have a group of people. And their confidentiality is um I have to put out to that and."
15031.0,Patient,So.
741.0,Provider,For that hour that he's in group. He needs to be the only one in the room.
15031.0,Patient,"Does that well. The thing about, that is, I can always leave the room."
741.0,Provider,Okay okay yeah. that's why.
15031.0,Patient,If you can get him if. I could get him some headphones headphones. I could work on that.
741.0,Provider,"Okay yeah because i'm that way if he has headphones he can hear and speak into them and. participate in the group, but you don't. hear what the Group is saying. So they're comfortable protected and the other part of. That I understand. I think that you need to help him away. On the medication issue, maybe, yes, and so that's why it was wondering if possibly we can do the headphone thing so that That way, you can type in what he needs because he may not be able to see you all I have to do that. Because he does."
15031.0,Patient,With any type in what we need.
741.0,Provider,"Well, like during part of the group he talks to kizzy who is his prescriber so he needs refills or anything like that."
15031.0,Patient,"Then I understand that, but I i'm. i'm his voice i've always been his voice, even with."
741.0,Provider,Even with.
15031.0,Patient,So.
741.0,Provider,"i'm sorry you're breaking up. Okay, can you hear me now yes ma'am."
15031.0,Patient,"Okay, even at the methadone clinic I was the one who was went in and did this paperwork and all that stuff like I was allowed to do that because I signed the paper and he signed the paperwork."
741.0,Provider,"And that's not that. He. And that's not the issue, the issue is that on Friday we do group. Where there are going to be other individuals in the group and we need to protect their anonymity. I guess. What they're saying, and they may not be comfortable with you in the group. Does that make sense."
15031.0,Patient,"I that totally makes sense, like I get that. Okay it's kind of like the same with yeah I get that yeah."
741.0,Provider,So what i'm trying to do is situated so that he can remain in the group. But and get the benefit of the group therapy.
15031.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,"But still, protect my other clients."
15031.0,Patient,"Right, but if it, you need to do something, while in the group, like like he said type in something I don't know he can't do any of that."
741.0,Provider,"Right, which is why. i'm thinking that headphones so that he can tell you that QC want some information or something along that line so that he can tell you type it in. Does that make sense if we've got headphones he can hear what's going on and respond to what's going on. But if he needs your system. Does that make sense."
15031.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,yeah breaking up. I can't hear you. yeah it's.
