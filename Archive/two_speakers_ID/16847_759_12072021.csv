May 20 funny my love of the first five months of the year, so you know I lost like half my hair and all that I have to go to the hospital and beyond super strong off the lights on medicines for almost a month. or so. And every everything was like an episode of stress that I had because I was like a toxic relationship I end up you know, like. My ex boyfriend was abusive with me verbally physically emotionally and everything, so I think that the. level of stress that I was going through, because some bad kind of burst my lupus honestly, because nobody in my family has lupus and you know I have healthy, overall I work out I you know, there was no recent blah, and for me to like have a decision like that honestly. mm hmm so basically that's what happened, you know, like being in this relationship and then having to fly with this disease pretty much just put me in a. In a crisis so i've always had problems with anxiety and depression like like you know, yes, they were severe, but this year was just something that I just couldn't control anymore. So. My ex boyfriend didn't believe in psychiatry or psychology therapy or anything like that, so I had to stop saying my therapist. I had a therapist from Venice well i'm from Venezuela and I used to you know how my appointments on like zoom and stuff every week and I had to cancel them for him. and Worse, so like I didn't have any. any help. To kind of like fine with all of these happening. Sorry age sq and and that's why i'm here right now that's why I look for your guys's help I was really in a bad place. Yesterday today i'm feeling better and I was working on this morning, which helps me a lot with my mood and everything and but yesterday I be honest with you, I, which is what scares me the most is like I I just feel hopeless hundred percent. You know, I feel that. There are days that I literally just don't want to be alive anymore I just don't see a purpose, for you know, like as my disease and all the problems that I went through and like i'm just like hoping that this will and will just go away. um but. yeah that's where I am right now They dominate semi prescriptions that definitely helped me out in the. first weeks it felt like she said that I wasn't going to feel. That like for me until like at least a month in three months. yeah, but it was it was quite the opposite, for me, like I. They weren't immediately.
