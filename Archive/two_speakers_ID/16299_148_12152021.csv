What I i've been thinking about was that i'm going to set up. In my house his office, like my my parents, they have an office room i'm going to set up by computer in there and i'm going to reserve that for doing work and taking care of business and i'm going to reserve my room for video games and stuff."

You know if they got my application, I mean they're supposed to be a major job for digital haven't done back to me. Which is weird well if you're not sure you could always give them a call and say I dropped off my resume on this day and just wanted to follow up make sure that it was received by the manager."
16299.0,Patient,"Okay, I should do that yeah there might be wondering why i'm flying for there, instead of the pizza place I used to work out across the street. I might be bad maybe they think that because i'm applying at little Caesars and that must mean that i'm not eligible for rehire at pizza factory, which i'm probably not they probably wouldn't be hire me so."
148.0,Provider,Where maybe they think that you've got tired of the pizza factory and want to go work at little Caesar.

And they rejected me on both occasions they didn't call me back or anything. So I never got the phone call saying you're hired they just ghosted me both both times so this time I got like three dozen phone calls or something from their manager who's trying to desperately scheduled me for an appointment to to you know, have an interview. And I just told her that you know you guys rejected me twice and i'd rather not work there and that's why I told her and I hung up so. I guess all except certain jobs but not others and mcdonald's kind of sucks so i'd rather not work there, you know."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so you don't want that position."

So it's unusual and it's it's weird you know, having dreams again. I don't know I looked it up and I couldn't find that as a side effect of philanthropy but i've only had it since getting back from the hospital i've only had dreams since going back so it's kind of weird maybe it's, not even the olanzapine maybe it's something else you know.

148.0,Provider,And you feel like you're still suffering.
16299.0,Patient,"I just don't know what to do with my life. I mean what what you know that's the dumb thing is that there is nothing to do alone, you know if i'm alone, then I might as well just eat food not exercise and play video games since that's what I want to do, but at the same time, I mean. yeah I just don't see any purpose to my life. Anyhow. that's the negative thing it's just this there's not there's no there's no I don't know. i'm sorry for being negative."
148.0,Provider,Honest you're being honest around how you're feeling right now.
16299.0,Patient,But there's really nothing to say about it and i'm. Okay i'm sorry.
148.0,Provider,Do you are you thinking about hurting yourself.
16299.0,Patient,"No, I mean if I have if I was going to kill myself, I put in all this work and then these projects and stuff and what I make plans and to go back to school and stuff. Oh."
148.0,Provider,I hear a lot of purpose in that.
16299.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,mm hmm I hear a lot of purpose in your life and a lot of things to continue going for.
16299.0,Patient,Okay.
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm and you are doing the work and may not, you may not feel like you're exactly where you want to be right at this moment but you're doing all the work you need to to get there. don't have purpose in your life."
16299.0,Patient,Okay.
148.0,Provider,And you do matter.
16299.0,Patient,So. What is so what I mind if I ask a question about therapy.
148.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16299.0,Patient,What is cognitive behavioral therapy.
148.0,Provider,"So CBP is that working around your thoughts so like if we were to do cvt we would want to reframe some of these thoughts. Because our thoughts affect our emotions, which affect our actions which affect our consequences so like if i'm sitting here and I all i'm having is negative thoughts. Those thoughts are going to affect i'm feeling right if i'm having negative thoughts. How do you think i'm going to feel."
16299.0,Patient,Good I feel bad.
148.0,Provider,"I feel bad if i'm having negative thoughts and feeling bad, what do you think i'm going to what type of actions do you think i'm going to have."
16299.0,Patient,That actions.
148.0,Provider,Negative yeah which it's going to lead to what kind of consequences.
16299.0,Patient,Bad consequences.
148.0,Provider,mm hmm so it's like this cycle. Whereas if we're working on reframing and restructuring our thoughts we're going to notice a difference in our emotions and our actions and are consequences.
16299.0,Patient,"And how does cognitive behavioral therapy usually go like What do you do, for it specifically what do you say."
148.0,Provider,We could do worksheets we can do exercises and activities.
16299.0,Patient,Okay. Maybe maybe yeah maybe that would be the type thing you covered group next week.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, you want to do that and grew some cvt work."
16299.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean like captain, why not, you know."
148.0,Provider,"All right, i'll make a note for myself that's a really good suggestion, thank you, Daniel I think that everybody could benefit from it."
16299.0,Patient,Oh i'm glad you have an idea for what to cover.
148.0,Provider,We thank you for your help.
16299.0,Patient,The people I noticed a lot of people don't attend very regularly you know it seems like everybody's late at least 20 minutes and it's it's just kind of weird because it starts like 20 minutes after it's scheduled right.
148.0,Provider,yeah. We can try to start more on time it's just that when people are come late it kind of throws throws it off and we can't let people in after the 15 minute mark right. yeah so that's when tanya usually really starts her medical check ins but that's something that we could work on moving up a little bit.
16299.0,Patient,"Okay, and. I mean how How long do people stay in this group. Typically."
148.0,Provider,As long as they feel like they need the support and that they're getting the support they need and there's really no time I have no time frame.
16299.0,Patient,"Okay, so I could be in this group for like a year."
148.0,Provider,"can be in this group for five years. Okay, as long as we don't change the date and."
16299.0,Patient,How long this group existed.
148.0,Provider,"I don't I couldn't tell you, because I took it over from somebody else. Oh wow so it's been a long time."
16299.0,Patient,"So it's really like a rolling group. yeah okay. yeah well hopefully i'll make some friends and stuff and. Hopefully. I don't know, hopefully, you can stay in the Group for a while and hopefully other people will also stay in the group and stuff. If you kind of a. it's kind of like I tried to call somebody yesterday. The person who kept me from killing myself during my suicide attempt. And I called her, I asked her Maybe she want to play a video game with me and my brother and I asked her how she was and thanked her and. You know it's funny, though, because she didn't she she obviously will never reply to that phone call she'll never reply to the voicemail I left. And it got me thinking you know man, I only ever get to know somebody for just a couple months at a time and then I never hear from them again, you know. it's like I just leave a trail of destruction everywhere, they go right. So that's what I was just thinking about with this group, you know it's like i'm never going to at some point. Everybody that I know in the group is going to be gone and it's going to be just me and then then i'll be in square one it's like it makes me feel like Why do I put an effort with people you know."
148.0,Provider,"Say you're already looking into the future and, seeing that you'll be left behind. Because I feel."
16299.0,Patient,yeah you know i'm sure you sometimes have that feeling to break.
148.0,Provider,course.
16299.0,Patient,Okay. Well it's a coming up on 25 minutes. i'd say we could cut it down to two now I don't have much else to talk about.
148.0,Provider,"Well, these are a little bit of concerning thoughts that you're having is there anything else you want to process about him or or talk about how you're coping with having these. These negative thoughts."
16299.0,Patient,"Oh, how to cope. mm hmm it's just embarrassment have to cope, but."
148.0,Provider,that's you know that's actually really brave work.
16299.0,Patient,I was a brave.
148.0,Provider,"Because you're taking something that's really challenging for you and getting out of your comfort zone, you know if you're coping with this. you're really challenging yourself to do something different."
16299.0,Patient,So it's a challenge it's not really bravery.
148.0,Provider,"But it is brave to challenge yourself, because if you're if you're not challenging yourself you're just saying exactly where you are. Okay challenging yourself that means you're growing and making progress, you just showing up here and talking here talking to me and showing up in the group and talking in the group that's brave."
16299.0,Patient,Okay.
148.0,Provider,"You are doing some really, really powerful work right now, Daniel so I want to encourage you to pick back up the journaling. And really focus on your thoughts this next week."
16299.0,Patient,"Okay, I can do that."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, and see what's coming out as your journaling are these negative thoughts are they positive thoughts and if they are negative thoughts I want to start to identify those and start to reframe them and find. You know, some beauty and what you're going through right now."
16299.0,Patient,Okay.
148.0,Provider,How does that sound.
16299.0,Patient,"sounds like a good plan, I have nothing more to talk about out of ideas for what to say."
148.0,Provider,"Okay that's Okay, I want to get you scheduled before I let you go and get you scheduled. For your next individual session, which will be."
16299.0,Patient,The 29th same time.
148.0,Provider,"i'm so i'm actually going to be out of town that week, would you be okay with pushing it out a week."
16299.0,Patient,To the fifth. yeah okay.
148.0,Provider,"Today, for Wednesday the fifth perfect do you want to do same time."
16299.0,Patient,um yeah.
148.0,Provider,"All right, Daniel so Wednesday January 5 at 12pm I just want to remind you in between sessions, even if i'm not available or from out of town. If you're feeling like you really need to talk to somebody just calling the virtual clinic and say I need to talk to somebody my therapist isn't available, can you let me talk to somebody else, and they will set that up for you okay. Okay, I just want to make sure you know that's always an option we're here to support you and you're doing great you're doing great."
16299.0,Patient,yeah well thanks actually. I hope you have a good Christmas.
