462.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you go by Suzanne."
17994.0,Patient,am actually. Sam yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, Sam so today is just a bio psychosocial assessment so it's essentially me just kind of asking questions about everything physical, mental social you know all around what's going on with you currently and. Maybe a little bit about what's going on in the past as well, but first I want to see do you have any questions or anything for me."
17994.0,Patient,um well mainly i'm just wondering if i'm going to. be seeing you specifically for the next like am I going to be jumping around between therapists.
462.0,Provider,"No, you will be seeing me. And then your group which i'm. Not quite sure if you're in my group or not, but there might be a different therapist for your group of for individually you'll. be seeing me."
17994.0,Patient,"Okay, I requested, only to have individual sessions that's okay."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, we do encourage everybody to join the groups, it is a part of the program So is there a way to have you try one of them or try at a smaller frequency and see how it goes, or we can even talk about you know why you don't want to."
17994.0,Patient,yeah maybe we can get to that at some point um. yeah I didn't really realize that that was a like a key factor in this um so maybe I can understand more about it at some point but yeah we can get.
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that sounds good, and then just something I share with everyone is the limits of confidentiality so everything that you share with me is kept confidential within the bright heart team. Unless you have intention to harm yourself harm someone else, or you report any type of child abuse to me or elder abuse or neglect, I do have to report those things but otherwise we keep it confidential. Okay. So we can just start with what brings you in today and how did you end up at bright heart."
17994.0,Patient,"um well i've had. A lot of really crazy mood swings and ever since I was a kid and. I am finding that I just have a lot of tendencies and might be holding me back i'm just mental health wise I feel like overall i'm doing fine but. I actually talked to the psychiatrist the first day I guess last week, and she helped me understand that I would been previously kind of misdiagnosis bipolar which I have read a lot about and never really like fully would have categorize myself as anyway. um and but that I have a lot of symptoms of borderline personality disorder which, like the more I read about it really fits with me. So yeah i'm also going through a lot of stuff right now, because my housemate and I were dating and we had to break up partially because of these exact mental health. issues that are holding me back and so that's just been really hard because we live together so i'm just trying to get some tools to figure out how to kind of remain stable during this kind of turbulent time. Okay."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense. So, can you tell me a little bit about the symptoms of borderline personality disorder that you relate to from what you read."
17994.0,Patient,"yeah well I feel like my moods are very sporadic and they can be easily triggered with certain social issues. I feel impulsive and insecure, a lot of the time. and Just sort of kind of all over the place. I have like really strong reactions to certain social things I feel like I have a really weird relationship with like male attention. I mean it's on that weird it's kind of a little bit standard in a way, but I feel like it's getting in the way of my life right now for sure I feel like I have just. Just like it's a really weird like obsessive need for it um and then I also feel like I push people away because partially I feel like this need. So much that, then I am also kind of afraid of getting it so that's been weird um my my mom had a lot of really crazy mood swings when I was younger. That I definitely had a strong effect on me so um yeah I don't know if I she's like borderline per se, but she would like. Get triggered by specific issues and then suddenly fly into a rage and either scream a lot or not talk to me for like a few hours, and then it would kind of go back to normal and. That definitely was weird and I think whether its genetic or whether I learned to do it from her, I find that I have that similar tendency, where I will really exaggerate a lot of things when it comes to social issues."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and if you can think back. And just kind of pinpoint in age that this started. What would you say."
17994.0,Patient,"um I mean I was especially prevalent when I was like four or five I remember, but I. know we my parents and I traveled around every three years, like approximately so there was a lot of like. instability in terms of having to we would be in a different country every three years and um yeah I think that just caused a lot of stress on my parents and on me and then that stress would manifest itself in like like sort of like these. blow ups that would have been. So yeah."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and were you traveling around for one of your parents work or just yeah travel."
17994.0,Patient,know they work with foreign service okay.
462.0,Provider,Okay. And then we'll just go through substance use questionnaire so starting with currently do you use tobacco of any sort.
17994.0,Patient,Okay.
462.0,Provider,Have you in the past.
17994.0,Patient,"Yes, and not really too much. Okay hi, by the way. When I tried to. fill out that questionnaire that you sent. It wasn't. It didn't give me I wasn't able to move past the first page just so you know."
462.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, i'll look into that so yeah thanks for letting me know. How about currently do you drink alcohol."
17994.0,Patient,"Yes, I usually have one drink per night lately, which is kind of a lot for me, but um it's. just been really hard being in the House and then constantly seeing my housemate and just not. Having much relief from like the stress of that so i've been like trying to limit myself to like one maybe sometimes two drinks, but it will be pretty much every night, but I think that that is like. kind of just a coping mechanism for the current situation, so I don't think it's super out of control okay."
462.0,Provider,"All right, and how about in the past have you had a point where you drink more than one drink a night."
17994.0,Patient,"yeah I used to work at a bar, and so I would drink a lot on the job, and then I kind of realized that that was going to be a problem in the future, so I stopped, let me get my socks on one SEC okay. Yes."
462.0,Provider,"All right, and how about marijuana do you currently smoke or use marijuana."
17994.0,Patient,not really no.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and in the past have you."

462.0,Provider,"Okay i'm gonna can you just tell me where were you born, who raised you I mean you described a little bit what your childhood was like, can you tell me kind of like what school was like for you academically and socially."
17994.0,Patient,"I went to a French school when I was living in Bulgaria sounds weird and in Cuba, I went to the French school so so yeah I mean I guess the timeline goes, I was born in portland Oregon then move to Russia for two years, then moved to Canada for four years, then moved. To Maryland I think for two years, then moved to Bulgaria for three years, then move to Cuba for three years, then went to boarding school. For high school in Massachusetts and then I went to college in Santa Barbara and now I live in Los Angeles so um yeah those moves were definitely anxiety provoking and. made me feel secure about myself for sure."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and what was school like for you academically."
17994.0,Patient,"I mean my parents are very like. They really want me to they cared a lot about that, so I mean I I did well I like I did well considering, especially the circumstances."

17994.0,Patient,"I had a good relationship with somebody for about five years before maybe a look at this one it's been like a year and a half now and we had a good relationship, but brought out a lot of insecurity in me and we broke up, but it was good for me overall."

17994.0,Patient,"And will that one was definitely misdiagnosis because i'd only seen her once and she was a little off her Rocker To be honest, but i'm just this last therapist psychologist told me that. I that borderline personality disorder sounded like very on par with what i'm experiencing."
462.0,Provider,And how long were you working with that therapist.

17994.0,Patient,"Anything that you consider traumatic I think I do have a lot of trauma shunning my mom's outbursts for sure, but I mean yeah."
462.0,Provider,"All right. And then. As far as suicide goes, have you ever attempted to commit suicide. No, no okay um Have you ever had suicidal thoughts."
17994.0,Patient,"I have more thoughts of self harm in during really stressful moments, but they're almost they're fueled more by an excess of energy in my body and less. Like it's like i'll bang my head against the wall, not very often, but every once in a while something like that would happen, and then I would regret it like within. You know 10 minutes so it's really more just like this inability to contain how much energy i'm feeling in the moment or i'll like bite myself really hard or something like that, but. I mean it's it doesn't happen very often it's really it's more in certain circumstances okay."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's no you'd say there's no suicidal thoughts it's more of self harm and it's kind of overwhelming feelings and a lot of energy and not quite sure what to do with it so it'll turn into like you said head bang biting something like that."
17994.0,Patient,mm hmm.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and when was the last time you've had a self harm incident."
17994.0,Patient,"um. Well, last month, or I guess it was closer to December. My housemate and I were fighting and. He was really upset with me and I just like wasn't handling it very well and I was just getting overwhelmed by the conversation and so. I just like couldn't. I don't know I highly needed to like. find some kind of outlets, a lot of the time, I will go and run and down the street, instead, or like do a book shops, or something, but every once in a while it'll it'll just get to me."
462.0,Provider,sure. And do you so I know you mentioned that the suicidal ideation is really more self harm ideation and I just have to verify do you have any suicidal method in mind or.
17994.0,Patient,"plan that you carry out. No it's really just like outbursts of energy that I feel like I can troll and then very quickly I realized like this is stupid my head's gonna hurt later, you know, like I don't feel like i'm not like thinking about it it's only in that moment."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah that makes sense okay um and then how about eating habits, do you eat regularly do you restrict Have you ever had purging incidents."
17994.0,Patient,I mean I eat like super healthy lately it's been kind of hard to eat but out i've still been doing it it's not like i'm i'm definitely still eating plenty and it's just I don't have like as much of an appetite and lately.
462.0,Provider,And do you think that's due to your breakup stress.
17994.0,Patient,Well yeah it's just the general. chaos of all this stuff.
462.0,Provider,Okay. So that makes sense to. and How about. If you could just summarize your sources of stress what would you consider your top three.
17994.0,Patient,"Well, right now, definitely this breakup is really. feeling kind of insurmountable right now. And I know that it's going to get way better, but right now it's feeling like really difficult um so i'd say like in general, like romantic. interaction is romantic like relationships and relationship goals, I always hired like a pretty big issue with they seem to tip me over the edge, a lot more easily than anything else. and Other than that, I mean just general like i'm constantly like trying to. get to the next level of my life and. Sometimes, like feeling like i'm not moving fast enough and then i'm wasting like are my opportunities are that i'm not working hard enough that a lot of the time is like a big one to me. And then I guess Lastly, if I were to choose i'd say. Sometimes I just snap at people or I will just like. Out of I will have trouble communicating in a way that's like really exactly the way I want to come off and that's been getting a lot better in the past few years. But. i'll have impulsive ways of speaking to people sometimes that i'll think about it later and i'll be like wow like that was overdramatic sized or like I was really taking out my frustrations on that person."
462.0,Provider,And what do you think you said it's gotten better what has helped to get better.
17994.0,Patient,"Well, I mean getting. more stable in my career path has really helped and I have a large following online, and so I am able to share a lot of information with people about fire dance and like give people lessons and stuff and and like just generally like. that's been going really well overall, I mean right now it's kind of I need to work harder and i'm having trouble because of the breakup but um yeah like in general that really helps, but I also kind of think. I wonder, sometimes whether it's. it's like I can only be happy if things are going super well and everybody is like i'm getting a lot of attention, you know, then i'm."
462.0,Provider,kind of like right.
17994.0,Patient,"that's interesting. there's like a lot around attention. And that's I think why right now it's just really hard because. I have like pushed a lot of people away because i'm trying not to crave this attention so much. But it's also. Now i've pushed people away and so i'm not getting that and i'm feeling really unstable, I mean not really unstable i'm feeling fine I can handle this but i'm feeling like just stressed about how much I want that, and how much i'm not getting that from certain people."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so just kind of thinking about your goals in therapy and what you want to gain out of therapy in relation to those three stress topics, what would you say are your your your goals are what you'd like to gain."
17994.0,Patient,"Well, I would like to. get to a point where I understand a little bit more about why I have I guess such like attention seeking needs that like I feel like super. Like I. I feel kind of crazy not having them. And I would also like to start pushing people away because. Because i'm like scared of needing that attention so much. So yeah I guess that and just. Just developing a healthier relationship with how I am communicating and how i'm. I don't know. Just like get a little bit more stable within myself in general i'd say."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I think those are really great goals, and so we can put them down on your treatment plan is sort of the you know long term goals that we're going to be working towards and. As we carry on break it down into sort of little bite sized pieces so that's a pretty you know big goals and we can break it down and make short term goals each week as we carry along."
17994.0,Patient,Can I can I be right back just two seconds.
462.0,Provider,"um yeah so. Those are all the questions I have right now, but I just also like to kind of open it up to you and see if you think there's anything else that's important to know about you that maybe I didn't. cover."
17994.0,Patient,um. I think that those are really it and. yeah I think that we have a serious really focus on that stuff.
462.0,Provider,"yeah I think that sounds like you're really know what you want, which is great that's a good start, you have an idea. You know I can just see you're kind of exhausted by this cycle of the attention and the withdraw and and I don't blame you so that's something we can absolutely focus on. So let me just pull up your. chart and see if there's anything, and I see, so you had the method of evaluation and are you going to be receiving meds from us."
17994.0,Patient,No.
462.0,Provider,"No Okay, are you currently receiving meds from a different provider. Okay, what meds are you taking."
17994.0,Patient,um well i'm prescribed adderall but i'm not really taking it right now.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and is that the only one. yeah okay all right. Then we can schedule you for next time. So yeah just how the program works, basically, is. Ideally you'd be in weekly group therapy and then every other week individual. So just kind of back to that group therapy piece is there a resistance to group therapy. For a specific reason have you ever tried it did you have a bad experience."
17994.0,Patient,"um I mean there's a lot of different reasons, it does not appeal to you at all, I think I don't really want to hear about anybody else's problems they don't want to use their. ways of thinking or anything about anybody else to sort through my own stuff that sounds like a really indirect way of getting to. it's just sounds really inefficient and it sounds more like a way to save money for from the therapists than anything else, I think that individual therapy would be a lot more direct and to the point. yeah it just sounds it just sounds like something that people are doing, because they have a finite amount of resources and that's not really. I mean it's hard for me to push myself to go to therapy in the first place, let alone to deal with other people's problems."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so, would you be willing to try a group at once, just to see how it goes."
17994.0,Patient,"I suppose um. I don't know i'm really trying to. yeah I don't know i'm like really unenthusiastic about it, to be honest."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so I would just ask that you try it at least once there are a lot of benefits to group therapy, especially with the PD just kind of socializing and there's a lot of psycho education done in the groups. So you can learn a lot of the skills that are needed for managing the PV especially so. Again, it is a part of the program i'm. can't force you to go every week but ask and encourage you to at least try it once and you know see how that goes. So yeah with That being said, we can schedule you for your next individual. Are you available on is Wednesday typically a good day for you."
17994.0,Patient,Is yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, could you do Wednesday the 26."
17994.0,Patient,Yes. Yes.
462.0,Provider,I have a noon slot open 12 o'clock noon.
17994.0,Patient,Sure okay.
462.0,Provider,"Alright, so i'll put you in for noon on the 26. Alright you're in for the 26th at noon and then the other part of the program is the surveys. So you did try to do it and you said it just wouldn't go through."
17994.0,Patient,"Like I would click next, and then it would delete all my answers and go back to the first page."
462.0,Provider,"OK. So my recommendation would be. To call the virtual clinic and tell them. You know that you're willing to try one group. and ask what groups. You can join right, so you can find one that has a good day and time for you and just tell them that the survey wasn't working and see if they have any. Recommendations for that so with the surveys, the bad one, I don't think you would be doing weekly but there's another one called the pH Q nine. And it just monitors anxiety and depression. Oh okay it's going down or it went down and then it went back up you know just what's going on here so it's kind of a helpful visual and tool for that. yeah if you could just call ask them what happened there see if there's any way to troubleshoot the surveys and then ask them days for the group find one that might work for you and and give it a try."
17994.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah is there anything else, I can support you with or answer today."
17994.0,Patient,No i'm okay thanks.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, well, it was nice to meet you i've got you in for the 26 and I will see you then. Thanks yeah. Right. All right. Can you please I had her state, you know some ideas. starts drive some ideas that she wants to work on and some goals, so you can add that on there, as well as just note her resistance to the group therapy and note that we discussed that and she did agree to start and try one group. yeah and then suicide note that she denied no history of attempts or suicidal ideation but some self harm urges However, she said she. is mostly able to contain them and it's usually something like hitting her head or biting herself, if you could just note that Thank you so yeah she is a low suicide risk no suicide risk no history of suicidal attempts thoughts no method, no plan."
