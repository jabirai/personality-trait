724.0,Provider,Good good i'm pretty much over that now so. So it's not exciting.
3605.0,Patient,Well i'm the official coffee maker for the Tuesday meeting here and.
724.0,Provider,Nice. Nice. Was that easy for you to do. or.
3605.0,Patient,"That was easy I mean it wasn't yeah. You know it's a matter of getting just getting back in and doing it for me just. Having the world. to want to do it so. i've had some I oh janine. Self awareness really happened, the last three days, four days, whatever it's been. dina and I are talking and we're talking very positive. She. By Tuesday before they meeting when we cleaned out the garage last weekend my niece and nephew came over. I found all my old books. And my original a book was in there from when I went through the same healing recovery unit and. I was reading the stuff that the people wrote you know in there and it just it just really hit me. How far away from the program I had gotten and how far away from taking care of myself that I had gotten away from mentally and emotionally. And i'm sharing that with dina and. He asked if she could share something with me and that it would probably dinner her and she didn't mean it to hurt if it did, but she shared with me that. The day my mom moved in with us, I cut everybody off, but my mom I went into 100% protect my mom mode, I had to check my mom from my dad which killed me just killed me because all he wanted was my mom to come home and then to you know. be the married couple of a been for 60 something years. But when he had control of her, she would go in the hospital and he would take her out of the hospital AMA. And it would be half hour 45 minutes i'd be getting a call from hospital say my mom was back in the last time I looked like somebody beat her with a baseball bat. She had fallen several times and hit the coffee table and in tables and so that's when I. took my power of attorney, as I already had power of attorney over both of them medical everything, and so I came down with the hospital I I took control of my mom and and. Sorry, not only did I shut my dad out of controlling any control my mom I had tech my mom from my brother and his wife and step daughter, who all they ever wanted was her money. They would only come to see her and. So she could write him a check. When she came to my house she didn't need no money. He would come thanksgiving Christmas and a couple of times. In spring and summer and stay, you know, three or four days with me, I take off work and we would do stuff. My brother's wife would find out, she was here at my house and she would call. and tell my mom that she was on her way and my mom had a cell phone I paid for it. And so, as soon as my mom told me that rose was coming down, I went to my mom's bedroom and I got her person I took her wallet your checkbook out and i'm i'm in my safe. And then, when of course rosewood want to talk to my mom in the bedroom and my mom and come out she Kenny, I can't find my wallet or my checkbook and I said no monitor at home. You need no money when you come to my house. And sure the Fuck not giving any money to this time so she can just get the Fuck out of my house and don't come back. So. But I had also said Dean out. emotional and I had shut her out I just. I put all of my energy. into my mom Karen from my mom and I. mean it says she understands she doesn't blame my mom and she understands and she knows that I didn't shut her out on purpose, but I still did it. And when I was reading some of the stuff in a a book that you know people wrote. It dawned on me that I had shut dina out emotional. And so, when I called her and I told her that you know I I discovered some stuff about myself, and what I was doing. I didn't care I cut everybody a year and a half ago I cut everybody off, I told you don't suck and call me they'll come by the House, nothing. I don't want nobody around i'm trying to deal with this shit i'm you know i'm doing two and three counseling meetings, a week and I wasn't going to very many meetings. Because I just wasn't and a mentally state to put up with people stupid shit so I I regressed into myself. And in that process hi. fat Dino. emotion. And I mean I we went places we did stuff. You know, we had some fun, but it was very, very those those. Things that I was trying to do to create some sort of happiness some sort of fun in our lives it didn't last very long yeah soon as we got home. Some backing me."
724.0,Provider,caregiver role and ignore.
3605.0,Patient,"And so, then you know my mom passed away on December 20. And that devastated me my mom was always there and then. I get egg left on the sixth of January and. It goes, you know I I know you always said that you just wanted them to get to sleep and not wake up, because their their quality of life was wasn't very good, I mean they both had been mentioned real bad, the only thing they really did know was they were each together in a room. And that's that's all they ever wanted was to be you know together again, and so I I been able to get him in to the memory care facility and they were they were there together they were there together on their last breath. And so dina was hoping that. After you know the funeral and stuff that I would kind of come out of it, I would kind of notice that I no longer had to detect my parents. And I would come out of this. And let her in again, and she tried, I guess, looking back on it and. She tried so many times in so many ways to become. A part of me again and I just shut it out. So when I, and I shared this with her and she shared you know her her feelings and she didn't know how to get me back. Emotionally and mentally. Because I I was telling her I see you know dina i'm about one step from phuket going back in the hospital. Three years ago, I 5158 took my mom from willows convalescent hospital nate took her up to sparks Nevada. I didn't hear the whole conversation, all I heard was there was moving my mom from willows California this sparks Nevada I didn't hear that it was going to be probably a 30 day stay and they were going a specialized in. Mental illness and dementia and getting her on a Regiment and getting her medications because my mother became very mean. She became very nice to everybody, but me and she was even starting to get mean to me because I wouldn't I couldn't bring her home she had Murcia at that time. All I heard was they were taking my mother know and that I was losing control I no longer had the. I no longer had the power of attorney to remove my mother from the hospital in sparks. Because the. convalescent hospital and stepped in and. said look. This is what we're doing. And this is going to temporarily take your right to. make decisions. And in hearing in that shit all I heard was they were taking my mom and I thought I would never steer, and so I lost it. I did I did dina. I was seeing a counselor and and or and and dina insisted on going with me and I thought, right now, which she just she went anyways, and so we walked in there. I wasn't able to talk, I could not talk without balling I couldn't say a word without ball and continuously sobbing for hours and hours. And so I said the magic words. I fucking don't want to live i'm going to take my pickup and run it into an embankment and the freeway. And of course that's all it to."
724.0,Provider,Get you.
3605.0,Patient,"ended up in yeah I I know the magic words, I mean I send on the. Big county mental health drug and alcohol Advisory Board for 25 years. and So I went down to a hospital in sacramento and it was there were five levels. Five being the least in the porcelain all the way it's you know where they just stuck you're asking rubber room and you feel the full authority or something for controlling and I was in number five and. And the doctor that in my medications and. By day, for I was really feeling pretty good, so I stayed seven days there. And with the medication going, and I was doing okay. But I still didn't let nobody yeah. You know, and then my mom came and live back with us and. deena treated my mom better than she treated her own on I mean Dana white my mom's asked he helped me Bader of the inner inner peace everything. The daughter she do right. And I did everything wrong that her husband should do, for his wife. As in being there for her emotional, so we had this great wonderful talk, the other day, and was it really was good. She was glad that I had recognized it and she was glad that we were able to talk about it because she was so afraid that if she brought up. anything about my mom."
724.0,Provider,would just set you off.
3605.0,Patient,I was going to lose it yeah yeah I was gonna lose it on her. And I know I apologize to our said I. Did. It.
724.0,Provider,"At the time, you know what I mean."
3605.0,Patient,"Right, I mean I wasn't and she knew that and actually I knew you weren't doing it on purpose I knew. That. You love me and that, but I was hoping that, once the funeral was over, that I would be able to get you that. And so that was the middle of January, when we buried my parents and were able to bury them together they got my dad back in time for cremation my mom had a. casket, and so we were able to put them put my dad in with my mom and my dad rated full military honors and he's down in Dixon national cemetery. And so, she she said, I was hoping after that that, as we were doing marriage counseling to that. I would be able to combat I would wake up, I would see that I had shut her out and she was willing to you know move. That wasn't happening so."
724.0,Provider,"Well yeah I mean. That doesn't account for the. For the grief processing. You know what I mean like expecting you to bounce out of it, right after they pass. doesn't account for that section of the time that you have to process the loss. And we so maybe the expectations. seem. somewhat short sighted because that's not reality, you know what I mean like once you process the grief, maybe that."
3605.0,Patient,"understood that no she was hoping, I mean. And then, it just never it just never happened so. that's when. She made this decision she's done she can do it, she cannot sit here and watch me i'm. Just do nothing emotionally can't be. Here, for her emotional. So, and she also took her part right, you know I mean she she did she and I didn't throw I didn't say anything she also took her part, she goes, I also know that. I sunk into my own depression course. I was sleeping all day or I was playing on my phone all day or it's in the bathroom hot tub you know, three or four hours. I wasn't doing shit around the House she goes I just couldn't do it no more so we both have recognized and opened up that level of conversation that we both were afraid to open up and talk about."
724.0,Provider,So it's like the first time you guys have been real really honest with each other in a long time.
3605.0,Patient,"Yes, it really is there's."
724.0,Provider,No.
3605.0,Patient,"Three and a half years, you know so. And I asked her The other day I said Okay, so now what happens on the 30th day, we agreed to do 30 days. And she goes well, that depends on what happens in the meantime. She goes, but if if I plan on coming home, I said okay. I did. I believe her. And she's making her decisions on her own, of course, she has patty after a meeting, and you know, but I have several of my own going."
724.0,Provider,course.
3605.0,Patient,"You know and we'll talk. about that too. I said look, you know i'm not i'm listening to three people and then did can the marriage counselor in my private counseling i'm listening to check my drug and alcohol counselor and i'm listening to Dr Chan kill. Those are the only three i'm listening to dina on us. I said i'm sure you have friends, you know, whatever blah blah blah your girlfriend's blah blah blah, and I have you know even some of her girlfriends or anything i'm so sorry that you're going, you know handling stuff and. It can work out, and you know those kinds of things, of course, I have, I have friends that are just flat saying you know that their jets."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
3605.0,Patient,"And I was that way for the first week to. realize his name yeah without realizing the extent of emotional. On her but on me. yeah and one of the things she was really bothered by is that. When we first met I was we were both extremely involved in and a and na I mean we did you know chair camp out, we did this dance that then everything we always had something going somewhere doing something with the programs. yeah and then we did also stuff ourselves and, of course, from my mom again that just quit. I had to if I took my mom somewhere, it was in a wheelchair, and until we got a van. I was lifting my mother up into the seat of the vehicle. And that's up. and destroyed my back so it was it was easier, not to do anything so yeah and where we're at now is we're talking we're having good conversations we are putting a plan together for individual I have. laid out the things that i'm going to work on for me. One is. Being emotionally available to her. The other is working on the communication skills to. When she says something to ask the questions, this is what I heard is this what you meant. Right and if that's not, can you please explain it to me that. clarify the other is to get back in yeah get back into the program which i'm doing these for me and I pointed that out there, I said i'm not doing this for you i'm doing these for me. Because if I don't do it for me if I just do if you ain't gonna Fuck on work and I mean, but you know I had 35 years of sobriety or 33 years last year and I drank you know so. which was devastating. And then she told me two weeks of just before she left she goes, you know I want to drink so fucking bad at. it's ridiculous it doesn't seem like Why go on right, and so I told God, I hope you don't I truly hope you don't. it's not the answer."
724.0,Provider,"Well, you laid out some. Some good goals you're establishing boundaries that's. that's the stuff that we talked about last week so. These are all really good. progressive steps to make. The conversation and the insight that you've gotten in the past week is."
3605.0,Patient,Exceptional.
724.0,Provider,"The fact that you can communicate this with her without. turning into a complete mess. Is progress so. it's good, I think. I think if you reorganize your priorities the way you said that you're going to your number one priority was to make yourself more emotionally available to."
3605.0,Patient,Her.
724.0,Provider,"That should become second because the more you communicate with. Her you will then become more emotionally available. So what I. What I don't want you to do is just. To be like like a lap dog is like not like. that'll come naturally. You becoming more emotionally open that will become natural and then. By going to the group that will feed into that too, because you'll get. When you go your groups for you, you become vulnerable you'll open up so all that stuff your emotions will come back. And that, without even real. Any effort on your part. Will you have to apply it does become. Natural so communication with her is key that's the biggest thing. Being on the same page having the things that you want to do. In the background having things that she wants to make sure that her goals are being met. You know, keep her accountable for that that. kind of stuff. Just like she's going to keep you accountable. for things that you say you're going to do stick to those plans of. So it's good it's a."
3605.0,Patient,Healthy conversation.
724.0,Provider,will open up all kinds of other dynamics. Because when you get involved with the whole. it's you're not emotional at first that stuff that stuff like. organically occurs as you get to know people.
3605.0,Patient,But.
724.0,Provider,You have to communicate first.
3605.0,Patient,that's number one.
724.0,Provider,"The emotions will come naturally. And then having the goals and having the. Like the boundaries and stuff in place will just reinforce all the things that you're trying to work on. So you got you got a good set of goals, so good."
3605.0,Patient,"yeah that's progress yeah yeah. The 12 steps is is if I didn't say in the exact order but I mean the 12 steps is number one at that is first and foremost. Because a 12 steps are for me. To make me a better person, and I agree that, where we are Community get worse we're ending the evening and she's really in the day meditation out of a book. To me, every night so we're we're ending on a positive note. You know, and I started out stupid just saying hey the skies blue it's a pretty day. And then she responded well it's kind of cloudy here and i'm looking at the clock, you know what I mean we started out with stupid little conversations like that. And he came into being able to talk about other stuff and then ending the day with the day and age, so good we're not going to bed irritated or upset with each other."
724.0,Provider,it's it's progress.
3605.0,Patient,And it's.
724.0,Provider,it's work it's progress is. All those things.
3605.0,Patient,"Good been here before. You know, get back into programming and start doing what I gotta do for me good. stuff just like you said naturally come."
724.0,Provider,"And it will it will. You know you're still. Your emotions are there it's the fact that you probably haven't processed the grief of your parents. You know as much as you. should have but. That comes in time there's no timeline and how long you can process grief. You know, it could take a year, it could take a lifetime. And everywhere in between so. As long as you are aware that that you. Make time to really address those things, and maybe communicating with her and going to the a's. meetings and. Talking about it more will, in time, help you process that grief accordingly and. Then, eventually, you can move past. To where it's not soul crushing every time you think about it. And you can have a conversation about it, you know but. Right now you're still in that that real. tender zone where. You can't really talk about it at great length. Without becoming an emotional wreck about it. And that's because you. haven't had. many opportunities to talk. about it because either you can seal it or you're just. not ready to talk about. It so that'll help talk therapies, like the best therapy, you know medication is. All fine and dandy all that stuff is good but it's."
3605.0,Patient,it's just a.
724.0,Provider,"an assistant tool it's not the ultimate tool and really talking about your issues get it off your chest is like the best. thing you can do for yourself and the people around you. Because, then people are informed. About what's going on with you, instead of just on the surface me like now everything's fine. But below the surface, everything is a complete disaster. You know and you're just keeping it together barely so. it's not healthy for you it's not healthy for the people that care about you, because. They assume everything is fine and also they realize that it's not. And you're like why didn't you tell me and you're like because I can't you know what I mean. And that's because you have to work on that so. you're doing the right steps so. Take it one day at a time. awesome embrace the chaos, a little. bit all right yeah there's chaos oh my God always chaos and life is chaos, now the kitchen and the bathroom sink or draining very well and so."
3605.0,Patient,"anyways. I separated them so they all they each have their own dream now but. I bumped the water line in it and crap. i'm at a water right now that the farmers get it done tomorrow, I know how to sweat pipe but for some reason I cannot get this. One connection to sweat so anyways the plumbers coming tomorrow."
724.0,Provider,yeah. leave it up to the pros.
3605.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well and I, and I found out why the drains I didn't have to do any of that the air vent for the drains was so call was stuff gunk. Did it couldn't breathe, you know when you have dreams and it has to be air before water hmm so your your drain has to be. Below oh your air vent so that it can you know, take the use it to go without plugging up well yeah they are event, if I just went out and took that air van off I kind of see. The castles. But I. thought that I had no idea that was the bravo so but anyways it's it's all good you know, so I don't. Know yesterday I lead a leak in the basement because I have a sump pump down there, and so I just let it lake in there until I got the hot the octo because the stuff that came out of that was oh my God Oh, it was fucking gross."
724.0,Provider,"I was taking it, I was taking. plumbing is gross gross."
3605.0,Patient,"Ever fell through the floor toilet just kind of went. Oh wow but yeah I mean he was 84 years old, and he would have never let that happen, you know 15 years ago he had fixed it right, but his way of fixing there was he just kept talking around the edge of the toilet so it would put leaking out where. You sleep down, it was all right, we did the whole thing when we did it, but I should have went through and redid the the event at the St when I did that, when everything was open, but I didn't and so it's just a matter of. Fixing it, which is no big deal, I can do it, except for that that's stupid I sweated death thing three times yesterday and I don't know if you know much about sweat and copper, but. You can zero moisture in the pipe at all. If you have any moisture any water in the pipe at all and meet steam, and the steam won't allow the solder, to go into the connection, so you know it's like letting everything grain for three hours clean it together. sweating it back together and it looked like it was good anyways it was I turned it on and waters fuckin spread everywhere so. And that magic take ship, it says, you know you just put it around and putting it under water in your whole a fucking lie."
724.0,Provider,"yeah Of course they all live. Yes, they all live."
3605.0,Patient,But i'm you know. I made enough to where I can feel that. You know so and I left the water and the tabs I can flush the toilet you know do what I gotta do for day.
724.0,Provider,After that.
3605.0,Patient,i'll see you Tuesday and. Next Thursday at 1130 excellent.
724.0,Provider,Alright guys i'll see you then. you're good man Keep it up. That ladder you.
