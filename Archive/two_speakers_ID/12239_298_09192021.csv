12239.0,Patient,"Okay, and then we never did try Ritalin did we still want to go with it. that's what the insurance tonight, for that reason I mentioned earlier."
298.0,Provider,"Let me see if we never did Ritalin I have you on a two day for I canceled it on August 4 I started Ritalin but I may have canceled it. So it just it's on your discontinued list. Okay, never picked it up and tried to. know, can we try it so that there they won't deny it. Okay."
12239.0,Patient,So how is it different from. General.
298.0,Provider,"It doesn't have the PEPPER to it. So it doesn't. It doesn't have it doesn't give you a feeling of energy, the way that adderall does and. Children respond better to Ritalin and adults respond adult ADHD responds better to adderall I have some people who cannot do adderall because it gives them a nervous feeling and they do better on Ritalin and they're adults."
12239.0,Patient,"yeah let's try it, I mean I have is to end of the week so just a week over the one well. Being is tomorrow wow wonderful on the off chance I just absolutely hate Ritalin i'm like let's."
298.0,Provider,get stuck with it. And that's gonna be horrible so let's do one week or Ritalin and.
12239.0,Patient,"cut it out as. Well, as well, so yeah I was just suffer for like I was saying, like after the third day if I try just absolutely hate it i'm stuck with it for four days pretty much right I can't like it yeah I can't go gather all to replace it. With either one rather turn in my riddle and to be like hey look. Is this Okay, but how about this um. Can we do. But they probably one a week for insurance reasons. yeah let's do a week, and if it doesn't have to be stuck with me i'll just live with it may love most."
298.0,Provider,Great that's fine.
12239.0,Patient,"Okay, all right, and so, what are the dozens."
298.0,Provider,So top dose of Ritalin is 60 milligrams a lot of people respond to 20 milligrams twice a day and they're happy at 40 milligrams of Ritalin.
12239.0,Patient,During the time that we're doing less.
298.0,Provider,Of the four to five hours.
12239.0,Patient,it's like.
298.0,Provider,"it's less than. An hour, and so I can go for our top dose which would be like 30 milligrams it would be a tablet and a half twice a day or I can go for 40 milligrams which would be 20 milligram tablet twice a day."
12239.0,Patient,I don't have higher doses tablets.
298.0,Provider,yeah I know right a.
12239.0,Patient,"Well that's that sucks because, like one of the things that they said buy shirts isn't like is if I if I take too many times a day I don't know why it's weird that's what the pharmacy."
298.0,Provider,"it's so true that's why I do one and a half. tablets on people who are on a top dose of Ritalin like 60 milligrams i'll do one and a half tablets so that I don't hit that three times a day, but then the patient ends up taking it three times a day. They don't cut the tablet now they just. Take it the extra tablet."
12239.0,Patient,"No, I mean i'm sure I mean. I had recipe to to adhere to the policy."
298.0,Provider,"What I would suggest, since we don't know how your body's going to respond. To read Ellen and let's just go with 40 milligrams and see what your responses if we're under then we'll know it and."
12239.0,Patient,"Is it possible to do that, to give me a three day prescription and then I can email you after after say on Wednesday be like hey I think that 40 isn't good enough, can we go up to 50 for the rest of the week."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, okay so two times two a day times three. Is six so six six tablets. and sending this to the CBS and target and it's $10 and 89 cents."
12239.0,Patient,"Oh, oh hang on hang on ah. The CBS, what do you have the address for this from see."
298.0,Provider,I skipped boo. Oh yeah you're not there anymore.
12239.0,Patient,"So I really told them just a one time yeah That was a nightmare they kept not doing it correctly, and then by the time they did it, I was already gone, and so I told him I said one time, this is a very temporary thing so am I in the system at all for the previous one."
298.0,Provider,"And yes, so what you can do to get rid of it is to. whenever you are in the virtual cloud don't go now just next time you think of it have them remove that from your pharmacy. Take one tab to. The ID."
12239.0,Patient,yeah i'll make sure that only one in Davis exists.
