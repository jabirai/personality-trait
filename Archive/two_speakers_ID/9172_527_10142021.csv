But. My crystal she. sat down with me and we went overhead to. Try to figure out how to. identify this viral so you can think about what is it the little things that are starting to starting to get annoyed I and why am I starting to get annoyed at those things."

9172.0,Patient,"And I let her know. that she she needs to be on it through better because it's actually against the law for you not to have her caught out and, depending on how far back you go. I will report it at one time. And blended. Courses needs and education, and if you can homeschool her and do a good job. Then we had find a better solution."
527.0,Provider,"When she did she here, you wish you open to that and we're done it."
9172.0,Patient,"is the main thing what is that she. recorded one and doing the work she just let that was just letting that happen. I don't I realize that's what it was, I was like okay well, you need to get better at that time. yeah."
527.0,Provider,yeah. Well i'm glad you i'm glad you put your foot down on that because I know that's been a big piece for you is making sure she gets the education and. and staying up on things and not getting behind.
9172.0,Patient,yeah you can almost read. Everything that we have no wallace now so she spent asking like what's that i'll ask her what what does that say.
527.0,Provider,Oh good good testing your vocabulary.
9172.0,Patient,And with words that we don't know I look it up on my phone for her. That or or less not last time I had it for the time before that I found a word of the day.
527.0,Provider,uh huh.
9172.0,Patient,And we were just finding ways to put it in a conversation.
527.0,Provider,yeah oh fun fun yeah. that's good how she do is spelling.
9172.0,Patient,um i'm not sure where she is with spelling and then asked her to spoil anything yet. Except her. She knows how to write out of her full name.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, good it sounds like you guys are her mom's you know, trying to work with her and get her caught up is she still doing the homeschool are you guys thinking a public school okay."
9172.0,Patient,"that's that's one thing that I was saying, has if he's not doing your job and you're going to help her then it's your fault that this is happening they're very fair to her."
527.0,Provider,Okay. So what are we going to be working on justin what are some things goals that we need to focus on.
9172.0,Patient,um. I want to be able to. Talk about the bad things like. If I lived with you and I broke something of yours.
527.0,Provider,in Canada.
9172.0,Patient,"forever to tell you that I broke, something I probably wouldn't tell you, unless you called it out. it's little things or even big things I just can't find myself to bring out and. Say okay I can't even then us, I mean i've been getting better at asking for help when i'm feeling bad."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9172.0,Patient,But I usually i'll just let myself. Get matter and matter. Mine rating that people can. or just not our art know that i'm just not wanting to talk to me about it.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. So, are you how's your anger Ben then is it just kind of stuff and then explodes or."
9172.0,Patient,"back and forth. and Lately i've been able to notice it's and. i've. just got asked for an open. Though. And it's. it's still back and forth, but not as extreme. Like a when I was spiraling I didn't know if I wanted to destroy something or just break down and cry. But it's Nice. out. Maybe a couple hours nothing tired me now. yeah and I haven't woke up man so that's uh."
527.0,Provider,But still just kind of feel on edge and easily agitated. yeah. Oh yeah.
9172.0,Patient,The question.
527.0,Provider,"Oh, I said soon, do you just feel kind of like still on edge or easily agitated."
9172.0,Patient,and Depending. On my mind side because. I could easily let myself get agitated. it's when i'm not paying attention to my. not aware of. How. i'm how i'm putting off my emotions. shakin.
527.0,Provider,that's all right we're just i'm just talking about regulating your mood and stuff and the. yeah mm hmm.
9172.0,Patient,Good.
527.0,Provider,But you had a medication change so that was hoping that would maybe a little bit.
9172.0,Patient,"i'm gonna talk to her twice about it and she's a agreed because. i'm my metabolism is going faster now since i'm doing more stuff. Working and then during a lot more physical activity walking more. Okay, I already have a faster metabolism."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9172.0,Patient,"um I haven't been happy pretty happy about the last. Like three months cuz I realized that December i've gone, I will be December 17 will be 10 years from my surgery."
527.0,Provider,Really wow okay.
9172.0,Patient,I didn't think i'd make it this far.
527.0,Provider,yeah I was gonna say how are you feeling about that.
9172.0,Patient,um.
527.0,Provider,that's a long time.
9172.0,Patient,yeah i'm pretty i'm pretty positive about it now.
527.0,Provider,Anything you're going to do to celebrate that day for yourself.
9172.0,Patient,I think I might take myself out to practice. And maybe a movie yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
9172.0,Patient,"yeah I guess. It would have been two years ago, I know that it will. Years ago. It definitely would have been more of a bad thing, like how like how did I make it this long."
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah Why am I still here. Okay. yeah and I wondered if there was any kind of mixed feelings about that day like you know, that was a pretty you know pretty emotional time for you, then, so I could certainly see you having you know mixed emotions about the day to. But they would both be true like I mean it definitely was you know think thinking about 10 years ago where your emotions were at and those were valid at that time and and where you're at now."
9172.0,Patient,that's true to. Think of that.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9172.0,Patient,"that's a good point. I think that's one of the bigger reasons i'm not so like curl I wasn't really cruel, but I was mean to a lot of people. And I think that made me more aware of. Like oh we're fragile little things."
527.0,Provider,He.
9172.0,Patient,"had to be nicer to people, if you want to have nice things happened to you."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Is there anybody that you feel like you need to maybe just acknowledge and apologize, or have you made those kind of amends for yourself."
9172.0,Patient,"i'm actually been trying to start on doing that. i'm trying to do it after I catch it. I did today. I don't quite remember what it was, but. Oh, this guy he came by and he said something to me. And I looked up at him, and then I looked back down, and I was like you just totally gave him a weird face, and do you mean. He asked about the bathroom yes, if you can go to the bathroom and I was cleaning the bathroom and I kind of just looked up and like loud glared at him and looked on any anyways like a and kind of went to walk away, and I was like why no, no, no. I looked at him I was like oh i'm sorry I not here right now and let him ask the question question again it was. Better about once in the question."
527.0,Provider,uh huh.
9172.0,Patient,"What it was was I put up the clothes signs already for the bathroom and I was starting to work in the bathroom and he came up. He was like oh Oh, can I, and I looked at that him and he's like oh nevermind and I would look back down. And I was like wait I looked at him I was like i'm sorry Now you can totally use the bathrooms I haven't done anything in there, I apologize no go ahead man."
527.0,Provider,uh huh good good for you catching yourself.
9172.0,Patient,But it says.
527.0,Provider,"How was his response, then."
9172.0,Patient,He was grateful and he said any apologize to me he's like sorry I I say the signs are up and I then I apologize back being like now you're okay I literally just put the signs up your phone.
527.0,Provider,"yeah good good, so how was how did you feel afterwards, knowing that you went back and caught yourself and corrected."
9172.0,Patient,A lot better. A lot better about it.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9172.0,Patient,"I. was mainly thinking that cuz. Yesterday was when I mean crystal finally talked about me smiling, the last couple days and how. Even though I mean I sling myself and trying to put myself away from everybody what I did say, even though I thought I was saying it nicely. No, it. was coming up to them and how it was down into them."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
9172.0,Patient,"And that's what. Because I cuz her moms in town. And she said that. One of the things I was saying, I was just being really rude to her mom. Oh, I have. More more respect for elders than I do, promote people if there was someone like my friends i've been like, so why, but it was her, I was like oh my God, no, no, no, so i've been so I have been more I think that's what got me to be more aware of what I did today."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure. yeah definitely. yeah not getting all distracted in your other thoughts.
9172.0,Patient,"yeah yeah trying to remember it's not just me. So and. I just thought you don't know what the other person's going through. He have no idea what you're going to. write, I know what i'm going to if I can identify it."
527.0,Provider,yeah. What would you call it right now.
9172.0,Patient,"In progress. So we're really, really relieved. thing here."
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I was gonna say like where do you feel you know what do you, what do you think happened that I know I know you got a job and in things like that, but you know what what can we do to kind of catch catch behaviors earlier for you justin and kind of stay on top, so that we don't. You know. get to this point again of."
9172.0,Patient,"I think I just need to. not be so. Okay, not doing something after I missed the first one, I think that's where my problem lies, like oh i've already missed one it's Okay, if I missed another one. schedule reschedule. But I. It I just need to be better at writing stuff down to and actually reading information down correctly, because that was the first couple of problems was i'd write the right time down, but the wrong dates and then I did the right date that the wrong time. and I think I get too comfortable, this is what it is, I get comfortable and then Okay, and I just don't start I stopped, taking it as serious as I should be taking notes."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah cuz I know that was that was a problem before, is that you missed your group and or session with me, one of the other I can't remember both and. Then you know it was like I felt bad, and so I didn't want to you know schedule again and versus just saying I messed up and I need to get back on track, and you know and. You know, because it's not it's not about a punishment, but how do we keep you motivated towards your treatment and goals that you, you are wanting to work on like and see. Successes for yourself, and so, how can we find the things that get in the way identify those and then put some put some tools in place to manage those better. The other thing I was thinking I don't know if this would be helpful at all, but. You know, would it help like maybe every Sunday night. You check in with a virtual clinic and go what's what's on my schedule this week."
9172.0,Patient,I like.
527.0,Provider,"You know and and just own it every Sunday like what's from Sunday to Sunday what's on my schedule this week, what are my appointments this week and have them, you know go through them with you or email you them as well, and then you can have like a double. Along with I think they do text reminders to don't pay. justin so. yeah but i'm went and that way they can say well you've got surveys do you've got your appointment you've got group you've got men appointment, whatever it may be. And then you can come from those just on a week to week basis and that way it's not like trying to figure out the whole month."
9172.0,Patient,"Yes, that and trying and mean not trying to just do it by myself. I think i've used. by myself, but I can't do it by myself."
527.0,Provider,"it's kind of like kind of think of it as like like a weekly pill reminder like I have these meds on Monday, Tuesday, you know Wednesday, Thursday so."
9172.0,Patient,I really like that idea i'm. gonna start applying that.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah That way, you can kind of break it down and make it simpler for you."
9172.0,Patient,"and I mean, I have my little book, but I stopped. On like my especially my date book. Once I stopped. Being good with my appointments I stopped writing and only was. Writing it down like on a piece of paper."
527.0,Provider,yeah which probably then gets lost and. thrown away.
9172.0,Patient,"So I, I also think that I should make that more available noise, how they cope and. So I know. i'm constantly looking at it. Because I know in the girls room, they have a calendar on the back of their door. Where they write everything down."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah sometimes it's helpful just to have well, I mean here's here's what mine looks like justin. This is my appointment book for week by week so yes. Plus, whatever calendar they use that I use for bright heart but yes, I have something I have to look at every. Every day. So yeah it just helps me kind of keep things together minders. So. Do you have a place like you can."
9172.0,Patient,Like you.
527.0,Provider,kind of want to designate for that calendar and.
9172.0,Patient,"I I do. have my own i've made my own little. Facebook for my book, would put my wallet keys phone and all that stuff that I need to go. Before I go to work, so I could just put it right there. I didn't think of that but yeah that would be the best better spot for it."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah.
9172.0,Patient,be simple.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm sure. And also just you know, having that reminder of where your appointments are so that you can also have your work schedule, you know, there too, and so, if you're seeing some sort of. Conflict start to come up like recognize oh i've got a conflict with work and and a group, maybe I need to shift my group or you know cancel if you need to but it probably be you know, probably more more beneficial for you to to shift into another day. yeah. or send a message to. So that our call in and reschedule if. there's a conflict with work or something that you can't make my appointment, or whatever, and we can you know."
9172.0,Patient,Find schedule and.
527.0,Provider,"Something else yeah and and a lot of times you know, sometimes I have to squeeze people in so. If you know if it may be, you know after my work hours not not relate, but you know, sometimes i'll stay an extra half hour or. Two an hour after my work day to fit somebody in if I if that needs to happen, so I can be a little flexible to if something you know comes up and things need to change so. You know that's that's always something to remember to so or even if it's like I I. I can't do a full hour session, I can only fit a 30 minute session well that's better than nothing, so we can at least check in with one another and still stay on track with you working on your goals for yourself. yeah not just throw it all away like Oh well, I can't do the full session so let's just forget it no we'll just do a half session. yeah yeah. mm hmm."
9172.0,Patient,"Very good, the case, the pockets."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, you're good about that."
9172.0,Patient,that's a good down to Austin.
527.0,Provider,Yes.
9172.0,Patient,A little bit better at that.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah. Okay So what do you hope to kind of challenge and encourage yourself on moving forward we've got some we've got some barriers identified and things that we're going to put in place to help that so as far as like. I know you said something about being able to talk about difficult things or.
9172.0,Patient,"your ability to talk about difficult things and. Being. more honest with myself, I feel like. Okay, like. asked myself why am I feeling this way, and my i'm. Being able to say at night, like jump for all this this this know this. One i'm feeling this way."
527.0,Provider,"Do you have a list of like feelings like and different like ranges of feelings like like a range or like a list of like happy is at the top, and like a list of like all the all different names of happy underneath that okay i'm going to send. Let me see do. there's my glasses. Is your email still the magoo job justin at gmail.

527.0,Provider,"Now this is like it it labels a bunch of names for happy. Like you can find like a range of you know, am I feeling happy, am I feeling just content. You know, different range of levels of intensity of feelings."
9172.0,Patient,or.

OK OK, so we can look at me scooted over a little bit, so we can see, so we can do here's self care so there's journal guides there's mood trackers obviously you can buy things too, but. What I wanted to go down and then there's just. Here, let me get over a little bit, so we can see it all. it's got different like. You know, met mastering anxious and depressive thoughts, like some different tools and stuff, but if you, you know self care. But if you go down, I think it's on. Oh no it's up at the top that's where I found that let's look at. You think it's under resources. Oh yes, here we go mental health resource links, I thought it. No that's not where I wanted to go. Change the website since i've been on here. Let me see if I can find. Oh, I know what it is massive list of feelings that's what it's called. changed it. Alright i'm gonna have to do i'm gonna have to research, a little bit because it looks like they've changed their change their website, let me see if I can. Go back here again. Oh, I didn't put all the whole thing, and maybe that's why, let me try this link copy. Oh, here we go. Okay, I found it now i'm going to share my screen. Okay, so go under, on the website. let's see go under the free stuff so you'll scroll down under the mood trackers. So these are these are free ones, and then that you can print I mean if you want to try to do one of these, you can print some fun ones off, but down at the bottom, I think, once you scroll through all of this, then there should be. Oh here's your emotion shot okay. So there's this that you can use. And then it's got difference different like it, let me scroll in here. Like if you look at here's some other other words for like sad so like blue sad disappointed were shot, you know kind of some variations off of that and then here's like angry, so there here's like. upset or angry, or you know palling just different things like that that you can kind of. Or at least it kind of gives you something to kind of you know, open your mind to like other words so yeah and then you know different. You know, different emotions through here to like miserable or optimistic or you know jealous things like that that you can that you can use, but I thought there was. Maybe it's up at the top here. principles. Like I said that I think they changed their website so maybe that's why I can't find it on here anymore. Well, that may be something to at least check out like you can, maybe even like here's like this mood tracker that you can use, so you can kind of identify like how your sleep was how did you eat today, did you drink water, did you take care of yourself like where were your stressors. What you had for what you did for self care. How much you love and appreciate yourself today, so you know how did I feel today my thoughts made me feel you know, however, and what I want to do to take care of myself tomorrow, so you know you can definitely find some you know some different things that might be.
