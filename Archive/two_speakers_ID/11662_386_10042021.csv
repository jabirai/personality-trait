The complaints vc get completed out and that's done for you, I sent a message over to Julie, she let me see if she's. Right now, she is notated that she's online and available, right now, but she could be in midst of group so um bear with us, but I will definitely get them all call you or text you once I have some. type of clear directive. On but I I don't I mean she has an override in there and the override has an expired yet so i'm not for seeing that this. is going to be an issue I she's aware of your work schedule and what's been going on, and I did add that in the note too, so I will let you know absolutely i'll let let her know i'll let you know as soon as I hear back from her and then i'll be in contact okay."
