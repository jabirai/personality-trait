ID,Role,Message
480.0,Provider,morning. morning how are you.
6498.0,Patient,Had a bad day to day.
480.0,Provider,walk me through it.
6498.0,Patient,"I guess, I was. embarrassed that I went into full blown panic attack yesterday. Ever but what I felt yesterday it was the scariest thing in the world, I thought I was done."
480.0,Provider,From the panic attack. Oh wow. So walk me through like what led up to the panic attack was it the fear of the virus being something more serious.
6498.0,Patient,And you give it to momo. Sorry did thing we Members and stuff because a bit around our work yeah. top of all that stuff because. It almost. sounds good for my egg nothing is what helped me. cuz I can't do it oh.
480.0,Provider,"Are you currently doing for anxiety, do you have any meds for anxiety."
6498.0,Patient,"No, no, definitely a good thing to build something waiting on a medication Portman are saying God i've got to do. is to have never in all my years ever felt what I felt yesterday. And it started at where we started late at that, like three or four o'clock in the morning I kind of got us to you know, a definite exercises instead I thought i'd gotten the so called nailed him, no. No. And I woke up takes a you in a full blown panic attack. broke out my whole body was like so it's sweat. and eat my heart was racing. Of a it wasn't the worst feeling ever felt guilty about whoa I mean I don't. know how to explain it is so scary that I do."
480.0,Provider,"Have panic attacks, I know what it feels like it's the most awful thing and. So when you start getting the panic attack and you start like sweating and having do shake when you're having panic attacks to your body."
6498.0,Patient,Low body was shaking know over. durkin oh whoa. whoa whoa. whoa whoa.
480.0,Provider,"Are you somebody that likes water. Like its water comforting to you. You know. I found for me and this doesn't work for everybody, but for me when I have panic attacks like that I have to get in the bathtub like a nice warm bath and just so Claire and that's when I do like grounding exercises, because for me it's not enough to just. Do the grounding exercises in my mind I need to have like my. Body somewhere safe comforting. You know so that's why I either get in the shower or the bathtub and then I start doing the rounding exercises like naming things I see hear taste touch smell all of that. And usually by the time i'm in water done my grounding exercises, then I can at least. walk myself through breathing exercises, because what happens is when we're in the middle of the panic attack. Like we've been talking about in group you don't really have access to your rational brain. So it's not possible to talk yourself through it and say like this is just a panic attack breathe so that's why, for me, I do the sensory thing do my grounding and then. that's enough for me to be able to access my rational part of my brain and that's when I can do my breathing techniques and just tell myself like it's just a panic attack you're gonna be fine like I walk myself through it that way."
6498.0,Patient,"So that's how I want to get a movie I don't want to be medicated I will be able to talk myself down out of it, you know. I mean I don't already had takes the box in every day and I said no, I mean. I hate did I even have to do that, but it's, the only way that I can. Stay off the bird girl."
480.0,Provider,yeah and that's fine and that's the thing too is you don't have to not be medicated some people need medication. Just to bring their baseline to a normal functioning level. Right so. You might need something temporarily for anxiety just.
6498.0,Patient,So that you.
480.0,Provider,can have access to coping skills you.
6498.0,Patient,"would have been tampered with us to get me to be able to cope is because I just keep talk what's up now, when work I have been. yeah like I had been able to, but I just could not aveda just knew that I was going to die I just knew that I was not a big."
480.0,Provider,"deal. Now, you know that you didn't die, so you have the reference of the past experience."
6498.0,Patient,Is yeah.
480.0,Provider,"And that's something that helps too is like when i'm in the middle of panic attacks when it feels like i'm dying, I can say oh you've been through this before you're."
6498.0,Patient,going about yeah.
480.0,Provider,Exactly but it's really scary when you feel new sensations in your body that you haven't felt before.
6498.0,Patient,"yeah cuz that's things I had never felt before panic attacks me because me it's like I couldn't move. cannot move, and even if I did get up and move that much sticker. yeah because i've overheard a separate i'm pretty sure from the virus, you know that was favorites. And Okay, so when a bow. was going up and down every and everything it was just the word. Ever felt in my heart was. Never have failed it and it was the scariest thing ever been I was almost ready to go to the word."
480.0,Provider,yeah I imagine.
6498.0,Patient,You.
480.0,Provider,Know did you ever go and figure out. You.
6498.0,Patient,"know the bad part with me. Is I get a bit ashamed and embarrassed that after what they want to look at me like i'm just thinking girl or Chapter one a growing. concern, so we do people out there that use the system. yeah and for people workers weekend yeah because it. So that makes it hard for me to go to the emergency room doctor is going to look at me like i'm. Just what i'm really not."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense, without do you have a primary care provider."
6498.0,Patient,"You know, but he quit saying he'll because, ever since I started to both did he has down me for just a market. yeah so i'm excited for you yeah you know that's why I always put in the survey they asked the physician know we know, he was so cold about it that. i've been back and look forward to it, there was no sense in a way that way it's like I can't describe the the pain pills I don't want to see you know what I tell a fail, you know you're out maybe the more it's like a very would still against the box it and updated. It is a miracle drug to me because it's a well off and you say people would have seen it. and I think."
480.0,Provider,That just shows me that that doctor is not up on current research so it's better not to. see him anyways.
6498.0,Patient,If he has.
480.0,Provider,"To be ignorant, as far as like pain, treatment and how far it's coming."
6498.0,Patient,"yeah exactly exactly cuz I mean you know i'm 45 years ago that didn't hurt places but. I should make a medication and. You know, I know, and I don't need pain medication. i'm not to that point in my life that I need to be authenticated every day. I just think the big normal. And only way I can be normal mail because of the doctors put me on so much medicine in get me move that now and we way I can't feel normal is on suboxone if I don't have a sandbox and I will go find something, because I can't handle the sickness. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"And no is physical illness, a big trigger for you, your anxiety or depression all."
6498.0,Patient,"That seems like it, you know conducted so see that I am I am afraid to done when was he a big fear a month that's something that I was talking about about me yesterday you know I don't blog and i'm afraid because. And oh and avoid Rod and I know you know. For some reason it scares me to death to. The unknown, I guess, we went ahead and say it. should be that way, but I oh so when I get like that it must be worse."
480.0,Provider,"yeah well if I just to normalize that that's a very common fear, most people are afraid of dying even people who believe in God and believe in an afterlife that's just a really common fear because it's so unknown and you've had a lot of death in your family recently."
6498.0,Patient,"Yes, of course, that's."
480.0,Provider,A trigger that. yeah. So it's probably a combination of it might even be more ptsd related then anxiety related.
6498.0,Patient,"To my MIC yeah. Exactly well my phone Greens are good, it takes me my heart drop anymore, because i'm so afraid of what up what a hero, the other end of the phone. calls to fear of what somebody else said, Kate Kate. orders with Kate right now I would never be within a really honest like a like a able to deal with it would have. said when I talk to you today that I had to be as honest and open with you so possibly could I never felt very comfortable with Michelle you know, so I really never opened up to her, I should have. You know, but i've ever. felt comfortable with her, but. I don't know what is from the get go up and like I can just open up do you feel that your don't judge me it'll know towards me, you know, and I talked about with Michelle I don't know why I hate to even say the thing that he always was canceled on me. yeah and what are they good are the most it seemed like he would cancel be. smashing yeah I was very frustrated, you know. But I was just perfect that your report that was today because i've been a bit of wait wait call you don't. You go so."
480.0,Provider,"Well, you know you can always email me too if you're really struggling and it's a day we don't have an appointment, you can always email me and tell me what's going on, and I can just just so you know someone else knows what's happening, and you have that support."
6498.0,Patient,"yeah appreciate it, I really do because I have gone through a really hard to do, and so I try to read right now but it's just so hard to make it not cry you know cause. A man. I am excited I don't want to go the word order to. know."
480.0,Provider,"Which is okay that's The thing is, like you're not a mess you're feeling your emotions and you know your emotions, for a long time so there's a lot of catching up to do as far as letting your emotions out, I remember when I first got sober. I didn't cry for like four years and I cried over a broken pencil and didn't stop for like a week and I was like what's wrong with me. Everything was so shutting down. That it was like once I open that it just didn't stop."
6498.0,Patient,"yeah that's how it's been with me and saying like Oh, I feel it every little faith really hurts month, it was or. Just so emotional you know what a. I know I need to deal with the though I don't need. to double the work and that's what I was doing with the dog was. yeah I have finally you know tech made this year a big claim to realize that Oh, that is Kevin back to be the guilt that yay I love it either. The things i've done that I start to remember you take you go to keep remember, they were thinking then you'll remember are being told that you know why you were so good and you're. You feel. awful you know, but I know I can't change the path, I know a cake cake, but it's just like you're trying to suck the pinky SBA flashbacks."
480.0,Provider,"And that's very overwhelming when you start getting all of the memories back. It gets really overwhelming and it's really hard to separate. yourself, because you have to remember you are separate from you in your addiction with your addict brain right so that's how we deal with the guilt and shame is we separate the two we externalize the addiction as. A problem that's not a part of us right So if you can get to a point where you can see yourself as an addict as separate from you as a person. Then it helps with kind of that dissonance because you know, in your healthy right state of mind, you probably would have done half the stuff you did when you went out it."
6498.0,Patient,had to be no way.
480.0,Provider,"And that's where you have to. You can't take credit for stuff the drugs, did you know what I mean like. That credit goes. To the addiction and so does all the guilt and shame that goes with it, and so. For me, whenever I start to have memories of things I did. I tell myself, I did the best I could, at the time with what I knew, because my addiction, I was coping with a big trauma that's how my addiction started and I didn't know any differently, at the time and a. lot of bad things in my addiction, but at the same time it's like now, I can appreciate the fact that, back then, I did not, I honestly didn't know how else to live it was like survival mode for."
6498.0,Patient,"me that was. me I didn't know any other way to win I mean I knew how to survive it. yeah once I realized, you know that I was addicted I was like now had to do whatever I can't survive the doctors got me here. Now they won't give me nothing so now i'm going to have to get out here and do whatever I can survive and I didn't care what I did yeah because I was so sick that. Terrible vein, you know yeah."
480.0,Provider,"And that's part of part of what can allow us to have grace for ourselves is that it's largely chemical the addiction it's like once you are addicted and you cross that line into having an active addiction. you're no longer choosing whether or not you're going to use right once you put it down, then you get the choice back, but. Part of allowing ourselves grace and compassion is understanding chemically how our brain is working when we're in the midst of an addiction cycle. And what's happening is the dopamine receptor cells are being so messed with that literally our brain thinks survival, you know how we're talking about the amygdala that alarm that's like the fight flight or freeze. yeah so when we have drugs in our system, our drug of choice, basically that becomes the alarm and the survival mode. So it does the same thing that the amygdala does it like removes our connection with our frontal lobe, which is where logic and rational decision are. So that's why we can't choose in the midst of an addictive cycle, we can't choose to put it down because our brain is only thinking about using and getting more because that's our sources survival at the time. yeah so that's another thing is like. Have compassion for the journey that got you to where you were right because none of us decide oh i'm going to be an addict today, you know, like i'm just going to wake up and destroy my life it's usually something like you said. pain medicine that opens the door you get hooked and then at that point, you lose the choice. So it's okay to be angry at the addiction, but don't be angry at yourself about it because, at some point you lost the power to choose when you were in the addiction cycle. So, now that you're sober you have that power back and now, is where we can choose again, but you can't beat yourself up over how your brain chemically adjusted to the drugs being in your system."
6498.0,Patient,"You know that that makes so much sense i'm so glad you said that to me because that makes so much sense to me, you know, and it really helped me because I never looked at it like that, you know. i've put so much on me that the boy. yeah we're at all, but it was me down in the winter, that I was a little I did it, so I was like. As a mother that has been my hardest thing is mother would put my kids. Is you know. That is my word is that, even though both of my kids have been toby will you do forgive yourself, we gave me. You know, we know what was it, you know, it was the drugs that made you do to play so you know it. My lesson or as close as we can be know we were a year without pocket, I would say my first grade baby so she was a year old. So."
480.0,Provider,"You know, see things are already changing for the better and. Having that balance your mom all I got for grey baby."
6498.0,Patient,You know that that is why i'm doing what i'm doing and I wrote to you is ordeal.
480.0,Provider,Oh that's fine.
6498.0,Patient,That is my motivation is my grandbabies and my two kids.
480.0,Provider,"yeah. And then so. I get really frustrated when people say that you have to do it for yourself, because most people in an active addiction cycle, they don't care about themselves, they don't care if they live or die. I didn't hear about anything."
6498.0,Patient,There you go.
480.0,Provider,"So it's okay that you're using them as motivation, because eventually you'll want to stay sober for yourself but it's such a lie, when people say no, you have to do it for yourself in the beginning, no."
6498.0,Patient,"I didn't do it from us hope to but i've done it for my family because. yeah and they give my family have lost touch with all my family because of Monday, and you know not no Volume I wouldn't want to be around me either you know. yeah that's true I did it hurt you know I get angry at all that. stuff we do, but you know it's just like you know, taking medication, like, for my dad. You know. yeah that's a big thing of with that with. A lot of seafood so. and never really got the chilling story. 13 through that year."
480.0,Provider,But if you believe in an afterlife then he knows you're sorry because what you're doing now. yeah.
6498.0,Patient,"yeah look at it, you know cuz mobile don't be how proud, she was of the. coaching Center so what better of a person know that you've been."
480.0,Provider,so great.
6498.0,Patient,"that's, the best thing about it was bubble you though I didn't really get to talk to the database to make it to before he goes."
480.0,Provider,yeah how.
6498.0,Patient,"Was. Your day September, the third year."
480.0,Provider,wow.
6498.0,Patient,They don't feel like a year it honestly don't feel lucky or just feels like a couple months ago.
480.0,Provider,You is that what kind of thought you sober with him dying because you said you've been clean for about a year.
6498.0,Patient,"That was it what got me sober you know it was like grid baby because I could stay home and that's my hooray for that, I mean I think one of the table so bad and kids stayed at my first grade daughter, you know. You would have in my first set Messiah was my first kid and we had to avoid a girl, and he was my baby and avoided that see my grandbaby it was so hard for me, he said he'll never buy out is over, if you don't eat clean ball sorry but you won't. I won't let you affect her last like he did. And you know."
480.0,Provider,"I would like, for."
6498.0,Patient,"You but i'm so like they get that because, if he had about whatever got clean. Exactly, and you can say, well, no, I went about it, the wrong way I should stop you for being in my while he said I didn't know what to do."
480.0,Provider,yeah and sometimes it takes those really hard boundaries from people we love for us really.
6498.0,Patient,"Is it does it does because it's what made me. You know, get clean yeah because my daughter. She did my daughter had never has never stopped talking to me she's always been a mom so she. he's like mom you never have to worry about it, but I do want to see better you know."
480.0,Provider,And she has.
6498.0,Patient,"A has a picture of my grandbaby and I can show me how could send it to you, but it's a picture that I keep on my phone that shows me. How close to death, that was before clean in my little grandbaby at the top three months, oh waving my arms and i'm laying in the bed, where I can't even raise up enough to have nothing to do with it."
480.0,Provider,Oh wow.
6498.0,Patient,"And you can see every bone in my body. And I work like death, so I keep that Peter. to remind me is this what you want to go back. I did go to everyone and save us of what that again, you know because I was at 72 tails I was literally about there. Oh yeah i'll be."
480.0,Provider,Video meeting all together.
6498.0,Patient,"And I could ask what they eat I will eat because my problem was I had to hold Tom Murray was I didn't have money. yeah so I got something I didn't want to eat because i've moved by haha it would be able to know, so I wouldn't be. So. So I would they because I was afraid of losing my house so. I got really. I was really able to point to where my organs and go start to do you do with that sentence gotta give so at the when I first started it was lacking and server I didn't find out about to program until October. Oh, I was on. suboxone off the street, for the first three months because somebody either they speak it because you know they seem that I would really want to do better, that I want the pain medication and I was afraid of this walked him because I thought that you stepped about that."
480.0,Provider,Another medication yeah.
6498.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm gonna have to deal with that when I realized that. I can take that it will not even your hard work that was amazing because I felt normal I just felt. Like me again and I thought this is what I need. yeah can I get help, so I did. It, so why would the opportunity to see i'm just telling you they are just terrible i'm not gonna lie to you that's like right now I will have to. decide to pay for my medication. Yesterday and hundred and $43 and they'll go, but having to pay for it, I don't understand why I had to pay for. yeah and I had to had it in my Google and it was only $1 50 now I had to pay $143 for a must why yesterday."
480.0,Provider,holy moly i'm looking at your chart to see if I can figure out why that's ridiculous.
6498.0,Patient,"That That is ridiculous, but I have to hand that medication. and"
480.0,Provider,"I wonder why you said, the last time because so."
6498.0,Patient,What I love.
480.0,Provider,"Is the scripts. Sometimes, if they're written differently that's when they charge different but it's written the exact same as the time before and the time before you only had to pay $1 50."
6498.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, I had been have just for the last six months or longer i've only had to pay $1 50 and then all of a sudden, it was $143 yesterday and i'm like does it give you a reason why they stopped my prior approval. She said, your prior approval run out um what what."
480.0,Provider,What.
6498.0,Patient,That don't make no sense to me.
480.0,Provider,makes no sense. I don't know much about this stuff but let's be sure to ask Tracy and group on Thursday.
6498.0,Patient,"She knows I was born. I was born, yet, because I came, you know."
480.0,Provider,You can't be paying.
6498.0,Patient,"Three a month that's our drummer I can't I can't pay them, I mean. I mean, I had him a medication I can't go without it, so I had to buy an hour to I could figure out because I knew it take a few days. yeah and figure out what today."
480.0,Provider,"weird um sometimes too if they're trying to. Sorry. Nice. Sometimes, if they're trying to charge you that much to you can look up a good rx coupon because that'll at least usually get you like 50% off."
6498.0,Patient,yeah you shouldn't have to them will have that thing amen other farmers because they don't even accept them good X or.
480.0,Provider,Oh series.
6498.0,Patient,"Only had to pay $40 yesterday, they would accept it."
480.0,Provider,And that's so frustrating yeah.
6498.0,Patient,yeah yeah I was $100 cheaper by having that good our mom but they wouldn't accept it.
480.0,Provider,"doesn't do you any good if they're not going to accept it was. But no, no, I wonder if there's a way."
6498.0,Patient,"They have me with an appointment with a sack catchers. Yes, dominate. Yes, in 30 and Wednesday November, the third. Yes, would she be able to help me with me on something keep early for me to."
480.0,Provider,"Get, that is what she is for that's why we're so excited to have her join bright heart because you guys in Tennessee haven't been able to have. Any psychiatric care. And so that's why we're trying to get all you guys in with her as soon as possible, because she can do that she can do either anti anxiety meds or antidepressants or both."
6498.0,Patient,"yancey they canceled on me, I had an appointment with her. It was senior than that and I had to reach good what were some rays, and so that kind of growth rate of me yeah I had it for about the torch it was going to be the 28. And then they ended up changing that to the third."
480.0,Provider,will probably why because the 28th is a group day and medicaid won't let you do two appointments the same day.
6498.0,Patient,that's what I figured hey that's what I figured came so I was fine with that I said I mean it's not too much longer wait.
480.0,Provider,"Well, good hopefully So what do you feel like works currently as far as coping with anxiety when it's not like panic attack level, because we have a plan for panic attack level now we're going to try the water thing."
6498.0,Patient,"see if the yeah yeah what else has been working for you as far as shouldn't generalize it. Back to Braden technique helps me a lot and and a lot. Of. The pressure points and so that she taught me how to do it back you catch it and i'm not talking to myself, how can let's go down that that's been my main thing that helped me. But if I get to want. there's like you said I just can't even talk myself down but. yeah hey you being here, you know you're not going to die, you know you're going to be okay good night would not work yesterday it was just like."
480.0,Provider,Were you talking to other people during that like did you call your son your daughter anybody else.
6498.0,Patient,"had to talk to people, but it was like. I didn't come to your room nobody."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
6498.0,Patient,Nobody to be I didn't want anybody seen me looked at from one guy was so embarrassed. But it wasn't what exactly that way. yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's the part that we have to try to get rid of is feeling embarrassed for how your. body is reacting to life right because that's something that I mean I totally get it, because it's incredibly frustrating when you don't have control over your body and like. Having i've had ptsd attacks like that, when i'm in the middle of like the real world out in public, and it is, it can be embarrassing, but at the same time. it's nothing you have control over which means you're not choosing to act that way you're not doing it for attention, so the more people, you can let in and like know what you're experiencing. The less you'll struggle with it, because what I do now, when I have when I feel a panic attack coming on as I call a couple of my really good friends who knows. They know like. What happens when I get panic attacks and they'll start asking me questions like. Tell me your birthday backwards, just to engage my frontal lobe to stop my brain from like fully going into panic attack mode so it's actually really helpful to have people who know what's going on, because they can help with coping skills and stuff."
6498.0,Patient,"Yes, that sounds but I need that stuff and I really need to do and I need somebody that knows it suffers from the same thing. yeah so they know you know we don't have to have reached out to them very."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and not even I mean you could even sit down with your daughter and tell her like this is what happens when I have a panic attack and. Would you mind if I call you when i'm on the verge of them, and you can help just talk me down and then tell her like. The best way to talk someone down, out of a panic attack is to ask questions like that that engage your frontal lobe so like tell me your birthday backwards, is something you have to think about because it doesn't just come naturally. You know, are like easy math problems I did this with a client, the other day she was having a panic attack like while we're in session. And I did like just easy math like five plus eight, so you have to think a little bit, but it's not like you can't come up with it. But just just enough of the distraction to where your brain is able to stay engaged with the frontal lobe and that's something that people anybody can do that for you, you just have to feel safe enough with them to let them know what's going on as far as why you're doing it, you know."
6498.0,Patient,Yet.
480.0,Provider,"But I did change a couple of my friends who knew nothing about panic attacks I taught them, I was like. I need you to write down a list of like 10 questions so when I call you and i'm panicking you can just go to your list and ask them to me."
6498.0,Patient,"You hit that. it's a good idea, though I really am going to have and. I know my mom's history, she suffered with it, and she can talk herself down out of them now she's can be made a cave with me, is no more. It has to be a great resource for you then. And he can talk yourself down out of one. good night and my. cousin my daughter, she was she had a mental breakdown maple wouldn't had her tail blocked up and so she's been through so she's another one that I can reach out to. You just tell me that there used to be names come from my mom that I know there's two three people that I can do that with my daughter is scared her when she's taking off."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, that makes sense."
6498.0,Patient,And I don't want get her up soon so. yeah my kids is like that my oldest gets really he's really empathic so like when.

What two weeks ago, you know so it's just what how much more can a person. really take before they break you. And I said I will I will reach out, and I will ask you today just some hell, no matter how. To get help and that's what I was wondering about is if that doctor was going to try to help educate me because I. don't want to be, but I know I think it's. No need to be kip earlier, so I can get through this what I would do right now. Because I thought he was too, a bit about that show."
480.0,Provider,"You are that strong but also if there's an easier softer way let's go with that, and right now medication is an easier softer way and, like you said it's not the cure all but it's going to help you just bring you from here to here right like. A little help with the baseline and then I can. See you can function normally and it's not a bad thing to need medication on and off temporarily either like i've been sober it'll be 12. Years next month and i've had to be on different kinds of antidepressants anti anxieties throughout my sobriety and there's no shame in that like there's absolutely no shame and needing medication to help your brain chemistry."
6498.0,Patient,"that's something i'm you know I don't think there's anything wrong with it either, because I think it's like you're saying something that's a chemical imbalance that's going on right now with me and that it needs to be corrected, before I can. Work on myself in a truly honestly believe that because of what happened to me yesterday, I cannot look through that again okay it's just so and and just how often do is pray and so horrible. I woke up all night long just. pray God, please note what would you say what this point. Because I cannot handle another. What I went through yesterday, I cannot handle them here, it was discouraged, I gave up and I don't know what ptsd or don't have pretty sure that's cause. The panic attack never paradox, we like it a lot it's the way my body shut down oh me was so scary that. me."
480.0,Provider,"Do you have to remember like it makes sense, why you are affected, like that, because you're so scared of death death is all around you and then your body shuts down and you think you're dying like of course that's going to trigger everything all at once."

480.0,Provider,it's perfect sense why you had that experience and why it was terrifying.
6498.0,Patient,"It did it was just like everything and the my mind would not shut off it was thought shut off and. And if that's all I need to do is pray. That. God has helped me extremely interesting that to each tell me my cohort and I need free kill before I get to the that case I have a little break down or something and I. Because yeah Tracy can do you hear a while back I got pretty bad, but not this there when I lost my dad this is worse before it was the last one. Really, yes for sure that was the worst that I had built. Even after I like that that's what i'm trying to tell you what's the word, the word attacks i've ever had in my whole lot and i've been have panic attacks for years. But I didn't realize it, you know which I got sober you know we started talking to group at seven that's what I found out. yeah that's what it was and. And in order to view it is. Your right now okay good Oh, I really can't do them all I need help with you know what i'm that's why i'm asking for help, so no to do you do."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's The thing is you're doing the right thing, and if this happens again before your medicated email me say 911 emergency i'm having a panic attack, I can even call you and try to do grounding techniques with you."

480.0,Provider,"I mean just a warning I go to sleep at 10 and I keep my phone on during tonight. If it's middle of the night i'm not going to get your email till the morning, but if it's during the day, even if i'm with a client I can call you during the next break and so just make sure you reach out if you feel like that's. starting to happen again, because I don't The worst thing is going through something like that alone. Right like it's bad enough to go through that but going through it alone is even more terrifying."
6498.0,Patient,"Yes, it is most definitely most definitely. Oh yeah reach out help me a lot, I mean you hit this. has helped me a lot I needed this day I really did. If I had to do ahead appointment with you, I probably would have ended up at the emergency room. But I would have said I don't know what's wrong with you it's probably anxiety."
480.0,Provider,I don't.
6498.0,Patient,"know they would say oh you're trying to do, trying to get hacked or something like that i'm so glad I was. You know. Like get people that tell me the way. made me more words for them to make me feel. Like that you know I would have been just words, when I way so that would have been a bad day you know, for me, I. Just would have caused my anxiety to be that much work but they've been that way to me, you know cuz you don't never know how you're going to be treated because."
480.0,Provider,"yeah well, and if that does happen to you just try to remind yourself that then judging you is their own problem their own ignorance their own closed mindedness, you know what I mean like. Yes, I try I know it's hard, especially in the beginning, but I try nowadays if I mean i'm pretty open with everybody about being in recovery, but like doctors and stuff if they ever. Try to say something that I could take personally i'm like no i'm not gonna i'm not even entertaining that because that's their mess to figure out in their brain. yeah I mean like. I know recovering addicts are not bad people I know. That recovering addicts are usually among the best people i've ever met in life, you know."
6498.0,Patient,"Though that's what I found out team. and The had the biggest towards that. And people that have never been on are the codes yeah you know cuz I look at it, as it's not a disease or not, and it will they will get us towards it is not we do not, you know that love. know who, in their right mind, which is that while. If you get back home and can't, you would think and think, why would anybody want to with that lab I mean wow that's that's what gets me whichever the doctor timeline you gotta have a little bit of common sense you're just trying to get more money. So you keep prescribing the pain pills and stuff because the suboxone is going to take over and help everybody gets this don't want to do it."
480.0,Provider,yep exactly losing.
6498.0,Patient,"Money record. If the money racket and it is you i'm just convey honest and some of the doctors down here or that's elder out for anymore.
