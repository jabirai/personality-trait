I have responsibilities with reporting up to our executive leadership. And went through our renewal processes, and so this has been overwhelming and I found myself.

760.0,Provider,Okay.
17387.0,Patient,i'm always dealt with depression.
760.0,Provider,I follow on when you say always. How long is that.
17387.0,Patient,"From the time as a child, I mean what my father committed suicide, when I was poor. Oh i'm. So it had a pretty big impact on me, I think teenager years I was really rebellious because of it. Because of it, but it was. Something to hang my hat on as far as being mad that my father didn't love me enough things of that nature, you know."
760.0,Provider,"So. See you lost your father at for it, how old were you when you learned that it was suicide."
17387.0,Patient,Was I can remember.
760.0,Provider,I say you say you were told that very young.
17387.0,Patient,"yeah there yeah. I think my mom just want to be honest about it. She always told me your father loves you so much, and you know. It just really bad choice and you probably need to type up that i'm seeking right now Okay, but."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you do with your depression gets so big sometimes that you have thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself."
17387.0,Patient,"No, not at all I realized, as I said that decided to keep on came out wrong but. No, it doesn't get to that point, because I know how selfish, it is, I know how it impacts child and. I think my own children I don't think I I couldn't fathom doing something like that with my children."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so your children is your three children is the. Is that fair to say that's your driving force that's The main reason you want to kind of push through and and. get to the other side of this. and your wife, too."
17387.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I want to be a better husband, I want to be present and. We have some arguments and things."
760.0,Provider,To not everybody does.
17387.0,Patient,I just want to be better for my family.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so but you're still you're carrying you you don't have a specific plan for suicide, but you still carry this heavy depression it's heavy at times."
17387.0,Patient,"yeah very heavy. Sometimes for exactly that and not feeling like i'm doing enough as a father or husband or you know. going through my career and either letting down my my leaders or falling down my family by maybe not having the performance that i'd like to have. There was a time in my life when I you know, I was young, and I was single but I knocked my workout I was a star performer I was receiving CEO awards and. being recognized and now I feel like I really struggled to keep. just keep things in order keep my day to day tasks moving and projects finished and things of that nature."
760.0,Provider,"Do you think it's fair to say that that it's hard for you, because this depression is so heavy that it's hard to do all those additional things like you used to be able to do more easily."
17387.0,Patient,"um yeah I would say that the depression comes from being having been able to do it more easily it's kinda like a. Performance like a need, maybe even having a male component to it of being a household leader, you know and. wanting to make sure that i'm performing well in all areas of my life so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so is there any other thing that you know this drive that you have that that you want to provide for your family is there any other thing that makes the drives the depression, to become more intense or more severe."
17387.0,Patient,yeah financial. You know.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17387.0,Patient,"i'm gonna have been very successful we just bought this House ever i'm living in. I make a nice income, but things that I fear, if I let these things, the anxiety and the stress or non productivity impact my life that I lose all of this and. You know my boss, is my wife, they all tell me that i'm much harder on myself than I should be. harder on myself than they are. And in essence."
760.0,Provider,And what do you think that's about you think that's true.
17387.0,Patient,"yeah because i've heard it from multiple leaders different jobs different companies different places are down um I definitely see the truth in it, I don't see the truth in it when i'm stressed out or when I have anxiety about certain things."
760.0,Provider,But I see you can see it after the fact.
17387.0,Patient,hindsight yeah.
760.0,Provider,yeah okay.
17387.0,Patient,"But I am. i've always been a high performer you know, like i've always been one is my competitive nature but performance wise in nature i'm competing with myself."
760.0,Provider,Do you think it would be fair to say that maybe you have some perfectionist tendencies.
17387.0,Patient,"Absolutely, I think i'm OCD in some ways. Maybe an overused term, but I think that there's definitely things that like I do compulsively. Okay, with a lot of data, like like."
760.0,Provider,Like What do you do compulsive like.
17387.0,Patient,"I deal with a lot of data, you know I get to do a lot of benchmarking stuff like that executives want to make their decisions around. What their competitors are doing or type of talent we're trying to recruit and so on, I can take a spreadsheet and I will dissect it and chop it up and provide every source of data benchmark. Sometimes I just go over the top, because I just believe that all of it is relevant and all of it is important to make decisions. Also, like cleaning the House stuff like that, like. My wife is currently in a project, and I just was stripping doors for her but. You know, like every nook and cranny it's very detailed piece of wood, I had to make sure that every piece of it has been completely flushed and cleaned of its previous. Previous life, you know and sometimes that could be over the top, you know I Why am I, putting eight hours into this. drawer that. it's going to look Nice."
760.0,Provider,"Okay i'm sure well okay. All right, so talk to me what are some of the things that you do coping strategies, if you will, to take your mind off of the depression and the problems."
17387.0,Patient,"um. it's just a recent habit that I picked up, but sometimes I all play a video game it's like checking me out from like reality, for you know just my mind just escape. I also guitar and i've been doing a better job of picking up the guitar instead of the xbox remote."
760.0,Provider,yeah you can get lost in that they can come become a compulsion in and of itself for some. yeah yeah okay um anything else.
17387.0,Patient,just doing things around the House i'm very handy so I just. get lost in the door. So that's another way of distraction.
760.0,Provider,"yeah, but it also makes you feel productive like you're doing things for your family too."
17387.0,Patient,Like a competitive person slices going to get one for me please.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good bad Okay, so what people or social settings you can you go in that gives you a distraction and help you deal with symptoms of depression overwhelming depression."
17387.0,Patient,"I think that's what's hard is we just moved to this area, even though we have my in laws, here we have like a big community of people. I don't really have friends here so there's not like a lot of like social outlet and being a father. there's a lot of time to really step away, you know i'm always supporting my wife when i'm not working, our busy I try to be. partners."
760.0,Provider,"And you you live in. California, is that, where did okay."
17387.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"good job, do you like to do I don't I. kind of liked that area, I was there, several years ago I kind of like the environment, back then, so and the name it's kind of funny."
17387.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's a small community but. it's pretty spread out, we live in stallion springs, which is. Its own csv or community service district. mm hmm so i'm like the call it going into town it's like 15 minutes to go to grocery store or like."
760.0,Provider,"Oh wow. So okay. All right, okay so support. Okay, so, but your support, how was your relationship with your spouse and perhaps your in laws can can you describe supportive relationships that you probably presently have."
17387.0,Patient,"yeah my wife and I are typical married couple we've been married for almost four years now and. or i'm sorry almost five years now. we're going on five years and. We have our troubles financially stuff like that my in laws are amazing that's the reason why we live here. will really support us they'll take the children from time to time, you know. Give us a break and. They they saying in a non. cliche way that they really think of me as their own son. They treat me like that. they're open and honest with me and they told me when i'm being stupid."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17387.0,Patient,"But they also you know, give me a lot of love, so I was almost makes me emotional talking about it, and that they really love me and I really love them so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have a very close family there. yeah with with yourself your wife and your in laws that's good okay. What about professional help. um it's my hope that you know. bright heart health can provide that to you, putting myself in these sessions, but do you have other professionals that that provide any kind of support for you."
17387.0,Patient,I just got a primary care physician out here.

I got a really good. feeling from her, and likewise for you Lisa like. i've had a good experience talking with you guys maybe working with the clinic a little bit difficult but um. yeah, so this is my team so far."
760.0,Provider,"I will, if you could do me a favor tristen. i'm going to give you my email, and if you if you're having difficulty dealing with the Office, if you could just like reach out to me so that I can. kind of do put an inquiry or a message on my end because I have the ability to like send messages and i'm already based on this conversation planning to send a message asking about this at a certification that you're asking for so i'm going to do an inquiry about that. But if I give you my email in your you're getting frustrated before our next session, can you shoot me an email. And just let me know so that I can. Do something from my end to ask about it does that sound like a good thing to do."
17387.0,Patient,yeah that sounds great and i'm just gonna put together.
760.0,Provider,Okay. Okay.
17387.0,Patient,Whenever you're.
760.0,Provider,l. p. Q UE I n oh.

17387.0,Patient,included.
760.0,Provider,"So just shoot me an email. And let me know, and I will send a message and just kind of notify you about that so because I don't want this financial worry to. continue to affect the symptoms of depression that you're dealing with so going to try to be proactive with that. Okay, so the other professional number that I would like to provide to you there, there is a nationwide hotline number that if if. People, even if you're just generally having sometimes people can have like an active plan. That they want to do something to hurt themselves and sometimes they just have general thoughts I wish I were dead kind of thoughts. And so, in the event that you your depression should sites cycle like that there's a hotline and it's just three simple digits similar to 911 instead of 911 it's. 988 so you know that's always available to you to to call okay."
17387.0,Patient,"show us that, like I just need to talk."
760.0,Provider,um. You want me to look for a local prices. Up area.
17387.0,Patient,I do have a crisis number so question number nine at should be. programmed by call 911 and I was admitted to the hospital.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17387.0,Patient,Self admitted. But 98 he he can use in case of emergency right or.
760.0,Provider,"If that kind of an emergency it's more of a you call 911 and 911 call 911 if you have a fire in your home or somebody breaking into your own work yeah you know those kinds of or you know accident kind of things nine a day this more specific for mental health. So you might have a better experience with my. OK OK. OK, so what are some of the areas when you're feeling like really super depressed kristin what are some of the areas that you can go to feel safe. bed okay."
17387.0,Patient,I find myself in bed when i'm depressed a lot. I have a bad habit of like blocking out my house my wife's always like turn on the lights and open the curtains I can't see so.
760.0,Provider,So this is during the daylight hours not not at night.
17387.0,Patient,"yeah and I find that it's like my safe haven, I guess, in some ways is like I like being in the dark. Sometimes it's even outside, though, you know, so I can't say it's all inside sometimes it's me working in the yard or. digging up. shrub or something. Okay i'm in some type of some ways that maybe that's a little bit of the anger coming out is I can dig up a shrub because i'm depressed and instead of sitting in a room I rather just kind of take out that energy."
760.0,Provider,"it's more positive to do that because it's going along when a person gets overly depressed or overly anxious. there's stress hormones that kind of put the body in fight or flight, and so one better way to cope with that is to do something physical because it allows the body, just to do what it naturally wants to do, rather than just going in a hole, maybe putting the covers over my head. or quite dark in the room. So that's that's a positive thing that I would encourage you to do more, physical activity which kind of leads me to a question talk to me about your your exercise habits. How are you with that."
17387.0,Patient,"i'm probably not the best in the sense that I don't like take time to necessarily exercise, I think I can take my outside work is being my exercise going on on the roof for retail beating a shrub."
760.0,Provider,Okay well that's that's exercise exercise does not. always have to be the gym.
17387.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,It could be it could be doing household chores that require physical exertion it could just simply even be a walk. yeah or a height.
17387.0,Patient,"And that's something that my wife and. especially here in touch we have high control, we get actually who really wanted to we hiked two miles to my in laws."
760.0,Provider,Beautiful area where they're very nice. yeah yeah.
17387.0,Patient,"I mean we have deer and everything come right up in our front yard and. Oh wow very. yeah very nice nature experience or living. But um. And we've talked about just taking walks we live at the bottom of the Hill and that we should just like my mother in law, she walks to the top of her hill walks back down and there's probably like a mile but it the incline so steep that it's definitely a. Little break a sweat so we've been talking about taking the children to also help police on their energy."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, that's good it's good for the family activity will create good memories for everybody. yeah it'll burn your stress and everybody else's stress it's it's a good thing yeah so okay so good, how about your diet and your normal sleep habits, how are you with those."
17387.0,Patient,um if we're talking about normal.
760.0,Provider,usual.
17387.0,Patient,"usual yeah I mean my diets good we cook at home, a lot we don't have the luxury of getting the calls."
760.0,Provider,that's pretty bad for you.
17387.0,Patient,"we're living in La so sometimes that that was an easy convenience, you know and so now it's nice to have been eating at home. cooking and things of that nature, I can have the tendency to. Over eat or underneath. And depending on my. yeah when i'm stressed out sometimes like I you know i'll miss breakfast and on this lunches sometimes you know Austin act throughout the day. And then times when i'm depressed for charging I overeat like all the whole pie, or something cuz it's easy and available yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay um alright yeah sometimes our diet either when we don't eat enough or if we eat too much of the wrong kinds of. bad foods that can affect our emotions as well, so those part of that is kind of important to consider too. yeah."
17387.0,Patient,"and sweet piece it's been scattered, you know, like I especially with trying out new medications I was taking adderall for ADHD. Which i've made the decision of not wanting to have our all I asked Mary to switch to my bands. Just because it's easier on the body and time release and things of that nature. But um. i've been adjusted in my medication so recently in the last month I sleeps all over the place, I can sleep all day yesterday I slept almost all day. Today is a day that I have energy so i've been up and running around but at night, I have trouble going to sleep."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so your sleep schedule is kind of inconsistent."
17387.0,Patient,yeah absolutely inconsistent it's all over.
760.0,Provider,"Okay that's another area i'm making yeah we're going to be next section we're going to be working on. kind of focusing in on a treatment plan on. What are some of the things we. want to focus on. So you know if these are areas of these things, I think, with mental health it's it can be a process of putting together different pieces. Because there's like no one thing that's going to make everything 100% better sometimes it's learning this new coping skill and taking this medication or adjusting the medication. Trying different ways of thinking, maybe gratitude, maybe activity and kind of like. Making changes. To the total. To the all areas of your life. If that makes sense and then it has a tendency once we start to do more positive things to art for ourselves, we start to think more positive thoughts it kind of follows that the that the emotions get. To be more positive as well. yeah so that can be like a private. School yes. Yes, so so you know next time we meet what we sitting together will will we're going to pinpoint a little bit more on. What are the specific areas that that you want to work on that's going to make your life and it's your plan it's not my plan, but what is kind of a collaborative process. To kind of pull that out, usually it's like an appointment process so okay so next question can you talk to me about your childhood, did you have any childhood abuse you already mentioned about your father. How that that's that's quite a lot right there, but how was was there any other events that were impactful in your childhood any types of abuse, he could be outside the home, it would necessarily have been no."
17387.0,Patient,"No i'm actually had a pretty good Charles that, in fact, I have to compliment my step father. Okay. He stepped in my life, shortly after my my father passed away. Okay, so I wasn't that as necessarily lacking a father figure, but more the kind of just anger of my father committing suicide. mm hmm and my parents were amazing parents, you know they. put us in football or bought me a guitar when I decided, I want to be a musician or you know wasn't things about materialistic stuff that they supported me. In those areas one thing i'll say that has been a big impact on my current emotion and current state, I guess. Is that my wife and I did lose a child, two years ago. And I think that was really the trigger a kind of putting me into a spiral of the last couple years. and finding myself here now, you know."
760.0,Provider,"But when we might, in general, was great I can't complain about my parents or anything that."
17387.0,Patient,"You know I lost my uncle when I was 10 but nothing impactful that. I can say, I had a negative impact on my life."
760.0,Provider,"Well let's let's talk about the did you the child, we lost was that during the pregnancy, was that, after the pregnancy, can you go into a little bit more detail on that."
17387.0,Patient,sort of both so my wife ended up having an infection at 26 weeks.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17387.0,Patient,"The hospital did not allow us to keep the baby, so they induce her we had a large bird that they simply said that the child and I have a group or productive life, and so, since we had our town for about 15 minutes. Just to hold her and just love her for the last few moments before she passed. So they didn't do any type of recovery or you know any type of life assistance after the child was born."
760.0,Provider,Okay. So all right.
17387.0,Patient,"Six months later, my wife became pregnant again and we were blessed to have plans, what I call the devil blessed. it's pretty hard one. For you."
760.0,Provider,"Where do you think you are in the grieving process of that for us, do you think that you have allowed yourself to create that or is that something that's hard for you to allow yourself."
17387.0,Patient,"You know I know the different stages, I can do this grieving and. I think our my media was anger. They have, I was in the hospital having a fight with security, because they wanted me to see show me their sticker tag up on our security on was like F you i'm using my child like Dr days before I lock you out. And I immediately went into anger out the words and then. grieving and depression. I don't know what. period of it, I would call the accusation, I believe that my landlord was a direct responsible directly responsible for my life, having an infection, you know baby."
760.0,Provider,Because of something toxic in your your rental home or apartment.
17387.0,Patient,"yeah we were renting her house and she had her spa resurface so early in the pregnancy, she had a company come out contractors to resurface the SPA and they were spraying formaldehyde and like a specimen can contain materials. into the SPA in our house is built in 1949 so essentially all that humans and all that smell enter the home and. She was not kind or not accommodating when I let her know that she was affecting my wife and my wife they'll stick law, she was pregnant and essentially the first company did a botched job and then about three months later this she had another company coming out and redo it again. And the data on unscheduled day, so they showed up and started spraying, and I called her up and let her know that they're doing again and once again making my wife sick while she's pregnant. and Luckily, that day, we had a phobia plan you're going to be uploading and everything was fine we said you look like you're doing great you're doing great. and the next day, my wife, the second way to the emergency room, or we took her to another one, and they said no everything's looking okay like you know for concerns feel free to go the emergency room. At night my wife is throwing up not feeling good she said, I was just gonna wait till the morning we went to doctors appointments they both say everything's fine, we should get up in the morning and see if I feel and so that morning is the data we're going to the emergency room. Let us know the introduction so literally two days point 48 hours after that they've been spraying, this is the best. Material we coating a in ground spa we lost her baby and. We never taken any legal action on the board taking any type of like insurance phones or try to pursue anything because. I imagine that pursuing it would cut the womb deeper. That, I think that by pursuing it, that we would have to rehash this over and over and over again. I just wanted to move on with my life."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. But maybe it's fair to say, I know grieving is a process, sometimes you know you can go in and out of those stages even even reaching the resolution stage. Not that. it's ever really like really goes away so do you do you think you allow yourself to express the different stages, as you know, in a safe way at the right time. Or do you think you try to hold it together for any reason."
17387.0,Patient,"You know i've had some hungry stages and I found myself going up with people, which is not the healthiest square of doing things."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
17387.0,Patient,"and also in kind of a bit of a legal battle with that same landlord since we depart her house she isn't she can still be over like $12,000 in repairs. And I honestly haven't been able to do that because i'm so angry inside, and so I guess painful that. It paralyzes me, it makes me not want to deal with it makes me not want to respond to her, and I just wanted to want to be free of this woman in her bullshit."
760.0,Provider,You don't want to have to deal with her ever again.
17387.0,Patient,"yeah like I have nothing nice to say and I don't want to say two things one for from a legal standpoint and also from a personal standpoint like she doesn't deserve that respect she doesn't deserve my time and. But I think throughout the stages, you know, like, I had a very clean white in laws and they helped me through it, but I think. I haven't fully I haven't fully work through it, I have to be honest, I haven't gotten, to the point that I need to live my life comfortably after I lost my daughter. and I guess maybe someone's I blame myself for allowing women to in our life or having the type of control and in allowing her to bully me, because this is she what she's done she's bullied and intimidated. Now she's a. She manipulated me in a lot of different ways, and so, in some ways, I feel like I blame myself."
760.0,Provider,"So your childhood, you said was mostly good with your step father and your mother, did you did you have any siblings."
17387.0,Patient,yeah I have a brother and sister. Both older. They have a shipper and dad than I do so okay.

17387.0,Patient,"yeah you know i've always been very passionate about benefits and especially around behavioral health, I mean that's one of the biggest things I promote and really try to encourage for my company or through that type of career that I have. But I think also i'm working in that industry. or our industry and things of that nature i've been thinking that maybe I shouldn't make some changes i'm not sure where I would go next. i'm very good at a medically but my analytical work is open all HR focus and so on. I like working with my hands. are more hobby days type things, but I would love to try to start making my career about something that I just enjoyed doing on a day to day basis.

17387.0,Patient,"i'm all men it's a little bit strange another reason for depression and I guess or having some hard feelings and my parents haven't met our new babies. They immediately wow stayed with us after we lost our child, but they haven't they haven't made it out to see our shop. A little bit of it being code based you know restrictions on travel and you know just want to be safe, as far as quarantine something that. A little bit disappointed with my dinners and you know I talked to my mom at least once a week. Oh, that disappointed with them, they they visited my brother and sister actually during coven during all of these things. They haven't you know, like I said they haven't visited House my sister is a drug addict she's. got some major problems and she's in South Carolina right now she doesn't have a phone to speak up, so there was no way for us to get Ahold. of her when we hear from her it's easy because she reaches out and my sister and i've always been very, very close you're kinda like the children that understood each other. That makes them. So I i'm disappointed with my sister and way that she made decisions in life, and what she's chosen to do with her own life."
760.0,Provider,And then my brother and I.
17387.0,Patient,"were close why wouldn't say we're close we're amicable. We get along we text message other on the holidays, we call each other from time to time, but um we don't see a lot these military so. he's been busy traveling around with his family and. he's in Alabama right now so."

760.0,Provider,"Okay, this."
17387.0,Patient,"around me down. My parents are alcoholics not not self admitting i'll call it, but they drink every day. So. They don't they don't drink, to the point of being an abbreviated or anything like that, but but they drink on a day as a daily activity, and I think that you know, for their health, I need to be concerned. Okay i'm not a drinker myself I don't worry. i'll have a drink or two, on occasion, or special occasion, but. I just don't want to. Do."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you don't use substances. Okay. Do you."
17387.0,Patient,"keep on completely honest with you Lisa I should. let you know, though, occasionally, I do smoke marijuana."
760.0,Provider,Define occasional I appreciate the honesty justin.
17387.0,Patient,"i'd say four times a week three times a week. Sometimes when i'm having a stress anxiety, maybe that's one of my escapes okay so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so a couple times a week is is that something you want to change."
17387.0,Patient,not really okay. I find it very therapeutic. For me. I believe there is a holistic reason for it or approach to it and that sometimes it helps me even catch my children even more. You know smoke a little bit and play around with them and walk around on the floor and giggle and just have a nice time with them and helps me escape from all these other things are going on in my life and just. saying you know i'm going to take this time and i'm just going to enjoy myself be present.
760.0,Provider,Okay. So all right so two times a week.
17387.0,Patient,it's a three.
760.0,Provider,"Three okay all right. All right, the only there's a couple of cautions that i'm going to suggest. For you just for you to consider. marijuana is a substance and it makes people feel better because it affects the frontal lobe. and basically shuts down the emotions, the the unpleasant, which is kind of turns them off for the time, so the emotions are still there, the anxiety, the depression still there is just kind of turned off for the period of time that someone under the influence and. Unfortunately, when people smoke marijuana or or use other substances usually there's a there's a tolerance that develops, meaning that you need more of the substance in order to achieve that same effect. and You said, both of your parents were alcoholics I know your step father's not a blood relation I don't know about your natural father, do you know if he had a drinking problem, or you don't know."
17387.0,Patient,"i've never heard of them having a drinking problem, either from our mother. I don't know."
760.0,Provider,He doesn't think she has one either.
17387.0,Patient,"yeah yeah at that time of her life, she didn't drink like that, so I. My father probably didn't."
760.0,Provider,Either okay.
17387.0,Patient,"Well, I have. heard stories of them like using cocaine and. Okay, being a social party or I guess."
760.0,Provider,"Okay well. The. substance use disorder can there's evidence that they don't really know but there's evidence that it can run in families so that's The other thing that I want to caution you about. it's up to you decide what do you want to work on, I just i'm going to just asked you to consider these two things and then what happens when we rely on a substance we kind of rob ourselves have the ability to learn more balanced ways of coping. that's The other thing. which I would like really like to focus on with you. So just think about that you know you tell me what you want to do from there, but I just kind of want to throw that out there right."
17387.0,Patient,"and actually to be brutally honest with you just because of the social atmosphere of. marijuana being legalized in some some cases, people are very accepting of it, in some cases. i'd rather rid myself of that having that stigma around it. And it's something that I would like to quit."
760.0,Provider,Something that.
17387.0,Patient,"I would like to work towards bringing myself i've ever even having a need for it, because the need itself is addiction right so."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and you know I am older than you marijuana when I was young, is not the same marijuana they have now they've they've made it much stronger. yeah I know I know it's legal now. kind of strange to me how they legalize it because before it was illegal they put it as a category one drug, just like the same thing, like methamphetamine and heroin. yeah and then and then all of a sudden it's legal. it's like i'm like thinking to myself what happened to the Gray area yeah. I don't think you'd ever below progression. Like. I don't ever think you belong in the same category as heroin, you know. So you know and and then I get concerned, personally, because every time there's a profit to something it makes me question that legality so that's the that's but just from the mental health perspective. it's a risk, because you don't know people people start out trying to substance, then, some of them. Maybe continue maybe they especially like with legal substances, maybe they do it socially maybe it's never a problem other people cross the line to what i'll call substance abuse, meaning abusing the substance and then over time that's when addiction can happen and addiction. is not something people choose it's basically what it boils down to is there suffering there they're dealing with emotional trauma Depression and anxiety, whatever it is, and their self medicating with it, and before they know it, the addiction has occurred."
17387.0,Patient,"And you know i'll say I. smoked or using marijuana products, since I was probably like 16. Okay um. So maybe that in itself is addiction, but I don't use it so badly that like I can't get through my day without it, are you. and I yeah I guess I I was smoking marijuana before it was. And it continued it's just made it a little bit easier in my life to to obtain oh."
760.0,Provider,yeah yeah well i'm just again i'm this is this is your this is your treatment it's going to be your goals it's your life. I just would like to suggest these these thoughts for you to consider that's all okay all right um let me see going looking through my list to make sure I didn't miss anything. kind of covered everything. yeah I think we've covered just about everything yeah. So do you know how to set up our next appointment.
17387.0,Patient,um I guess reach out to the virtual claim.
760.0,Provider,"You contact the virtual clinic schedule something for two weeks out. And, and then next time we're going to talk more about the treatment plan."
17387.0,Patient,and

17387.0,Patient,"yeah so she's done on with the case managers, so I really you know case managers up right right heart. she's been the person that's been corresponding with me since then I can afford you the correspondence if you're like."

Essentially i'm in your care at this point i'm not going to bakersfield day ago. My primary care physicians market completed because i'm not under his care he's not prescribing he's not deciding whether i'm."

17387.0,Patient,"Lisa one other question. So do you coordinate the typical group clinic sessions, that I go to so I have to be at seven I know that Mary my sidebar just poured out but I didn't know if that's what you were just another therapists in general."
760.0,Provider,"I think it's with another therapist I don't run the the Tuesday group. But. it's good that you're going to be, you need to be in there with your psychologist because that that's your time to adjust medications weekly you have that weekly opportunity to do that, should you need to. Okay, so."
17387.0,Patient,"yeah I was just curious if there was with you or. And I even like the idea of having a just another therapist for groups tech session anyways and then. Okay, the bounces off of more people to get some. feedback from so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. Nice meeting you too, and I look forward to meeting you next time. Okay. All right. You too bye."
