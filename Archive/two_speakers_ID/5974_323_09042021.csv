5974.0,Patient,"Yet happened Wednesday. yeah I was in the basement at the motel and I was. getting ready to put some salt in the. The water purifier thing and then I moved the Monte cobwebs and then my inserted phone i'm so into the hospital yesterday and they couldn't find nothing, so the game to this embraced and."
323.0,Provider,"wow. So, like know like if they can't find anything it's like knowing it biotics or anything like that."
5974.0,Patient,"No, they didn't do blood work that is doing drug screen is doing awesome."
323.0,Provider,wow just gave.
5974.0,Patient,I think they gave me extra. Do you think the leaf blood work or something to stave off. That my body or something you know but.
323.0,Provider,"Right and it's just the hand, or is it like going up the arm where it's swelling."
5974.0,Patient,"um well. It started like with my middle knuckle. Well it's a little bit. And then it went from like here, and then it started made a big pocket right here. yeah the money and. And they kept saying that I punch something and then. The lady was like well we don't see no like puncture mark for a spider be to bite yeah. right we didn't she kept coming in every scene come in, like five times and said, have you ever shot up and at hand. And i'm like i've never shot up in my life I said look, I asked you about, and you can see my whole body Dana puncture mark on it from needles, you know I mean like. And then she just kept coming back to that conclusion and she didn't even I mean they. May, maybe that's why they thought."
323.0,Provider,I was gonna say so that they know that you had a substance abuse problem or just medications.
5974.0,Patient,"Well, because I. I tell them all the time I go in like I get a Liverpool hospital hospital i've always told them, you know so they asked you."
323.0,Provider,"Are you on anything i'll tell them, yes, the box and."
5974.0,Patient,Then they just automatically go to that I guess. So i'll go to the. family doctor on Monday and take a look at it.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, it sounds like you need to do some follow up just to see if there isn't anything else, I mean had you injured it in any other way prior to moving spider webs."
5974.0,Patient,"Not that I can remember, and I mean, I think that if it slowed up like that bad that you would at least fill in as he hit it off with something married."
323.0,Provider,Right.
5974.0,Patient,"I just started appearing and and I figured well it'll go down because maybe I just bumped it, and now it just that had a big old talking on the back of my hand on looks like it started filling up put something."
323.0,Provider,What no particular like red spot like where would have been like a bite that you could see.
5974.0,Patient,strange.
323.0,Provider,Oh.
5974.0,Patient,yesterday.
323.0,Provider,"Does it hurt, is it like hot."
5974.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean it's it's a little War I slept on it last night, so now my fingers hurt, because I think i've pushed that pocket down. From the my fingers so now, these two fingers here hurt real bad."
323.0,Provider,yeah. yeah I know I could definitely see it in the knuckles yeah. Have you had arthritis that you're aware of.
5974.0,Patient,"And she said it might even be Gal but then I don't know they never tested order, I mean I don't know if you can ask for, but. that's pretty much all he says he said, have you ever had down syndrome, that was the end of that."
323.0,Provider,"And gout can be controlled by food to you know, like foods can make a flare up and stuff like that. But if you've never had, I mean it can be difficult to diagnose the first time if you've never had it before and it's weird there's not always good reasons for why it surfaces versus not, but a lot of times it is diet related. I don't know if you ate anything different or anything more than usual, and like a particular like a dairy or caffeine, or anything like that."
5974.0,Patient,"Those that I can recall, yes I sat down and really thought about it."
323.0,Provider,"Because God doesn't come from nowhere, I mean it's like it's like your immune system, all of a sudden is responding to something and that's why diet like managing diet can help keep the symptoms down. Okay there's not really good medical treatment for it, it just kind of flares up."
5974.0,Patient,Okay. He just got to figure out what you can eat with.
323.0,Provider,yeah there are some foods that can make it flare up versus those that can keep your you know muscles and joints and stuff just from. settled from inflaming. But that is kind of weird that it just kind of showed up on a nowhere and it's just the one hand.
5974.0,Patient,yeah. well.
323.0,Provider,And then X rays not going to show a muscle tissue issue either it's only going to show if there was like a bone.
5974.0,Patient,So they might have been trying to.
323.0,Provider,see if it was something was broken and some nothing broken.
5974.0,Patient,"Right, they must have thought I was lying film or yummy maybe they thought I was on something that was just lying to cover it up or something."
323.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like they were maybe making some conclusions, if they were asking you about needles and stuff too."
5974.0,Patient,yeah yeah because. I mean there was no there's no i'm sure margarine anything. move.
323.0,Provider,"hmm I think some additional follow up. is probably important with your doctor who knows, your system better. But I would wonder if, like if your hands getting arthritic and if it's you know some other kind of just immune system response to something so. It definitely, though, if you start to get shooting pains up your arm or anything like that. You have to go back to the er you don't want to take any chances like that, because that could be blood flow that could be hard issues. Oh, you want to take that more seriously if the pain starts shooting up your arm."
5974.0,Patient,or.
323.0,Provider,"So, and no fever, like you, don't feel feverish or anything so. which could."
5974.0,Patient,play a.
323.0,Provider,faction and stuff yeah.
5974.0,Patient,I had skills or fee we're. pretty much just as an aside skills or be where I didn't anything different. You know I just I can't remember doing anything different.
323.0,Provider,"So Wednesday, you did the. salt for the water, you were in this spider web space, what else did you do Wednesday."
5974.0,Patient,is pretty much did.
323.0,Provider,Any other like repairs or remodeling project stuff that you were working on.
5974.0,Patient,That is carried a bunch of salt lake there 40 pound bags to sell. Right areas from the parking lot down to the basement. I got to two gallons of white paint. couple rollers. that's pretty much it.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, and then, when did you feel the flare up was a Wednesday evening or. yeah okay. yeah."
5974.0,Patient,"it's kind of. harder around, then you can see, this little my knuckle get welled up and I thought, maybe I just bumped it on somebody. down and stuff and it just. kept growing like I said it had like a pocket. On top of my knee and here. Right not there now because, last night I must have laid on it, and I can fill these. These two middle are these two fingers in the inside, here they are hurt real bad now so i'm guessing I probably lay on it and then must squeeze that stuff up there, my knuckles into my."
323.0,Provider,fingers yeah.
5974.0,Patient,now learn Superman.
323.0,Provider,hmm.
5974.0,Patient,I mean it almost like.
323.0,Provider,"An infection somewhere, but they didn't test for anything like that."
5974.0,Patient,well.
323.0,Provider,"hmm. Well, I would say, if you if it feels feverish if it starts to get red. Or you get shooting pains up your arm, do you definitely want to go back and do more follow up. So. It is unfortunate because sometimes when you tell your history, or even the medications that you're on then you're up against stereotypes and. yeah you know they just automatically assume it's drug related."
5974.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,"So. How are things going at the hotel, the last time we talked you had had the fire Marshal or somebody was there and you're working on some things for codes."
5974.0,Patient,yeah. I gotta do some pain and. fix the wall and room and and I can be good.
323.0,Provider,So they can't don't be coming back for a follow up.
5974.0,Patient,yeah Thursday. They used to give me. Two weeks 14 days.
323.0,Provider,yeah so you got some work to do this week.
5974.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,How are you doing with the capacity.
5974.0,Patient,"No, not good, I got four rooms open. yeah."
323.0,Provider,"Well, that change well what's coven like in your area, because I know it's peeking in a lot of spots in Ohio well in Illinois."
5974.0,Patient,"Yes, not too bad around Columbia Columbia county. yeah not yet no mandate or not, but I always worry about anyway."
323.0,Provider,yeah are you vaccinated did we talk about that. you're now okay. that's okay. I did.
5974.0,Patient,I kind of gave them.
323.0,Provider,"And did because I went back to doing some direct patient care, not just online stuff either, and so they strongly recommended that we get it, especially because a lot of the patients are not. So it's really just to protect ourselves."
5974.0,Patient,But. You never know side effects or anything.
323.0,Provider,"Well, the first I, so I got the two shot version, the first one. I lost my sense of taste for like three days in all I could taste was metal. So I didn't want much because it was anything I put in my mouth tasted like metal and I was like this is really weird and freaky. So I waited a few extra weeks to get the second one, because now i'm hearing that actually spacing them out longer from each other, is probably better. So I didn't go back for like I don't know, maybe six weeks for the second one, and when I went back they asked me if I had any symptoms and i'm like well everything tasted like metal for a few days. And they were like oh that's interesting you had that it's one of the rare side effects, but it can be they had heard that before but it's rare i'm like great. So I got the second one, but I didn't have any reaction or response so."
5974.0,Patient,that's good.
323.0,Provider,"And I, we have had some patients come in to the clinic now that have been positive, and I think I did get some of the symptoms, I actually like two weeks ago, I was really sick for about 24 hours. The headache I was nauseous it just ached all over the place, and so I stayed home that period of time right they made me get tested before I could go back in and I came up negative but i'm sure I had something. And I just wondered if it was just last symptoms, because I had a had the vaccine so. Luckily, it was only a 24 hour thing, but it was bad I mean my. my nose the front of my face hurts so bad, it was very strange. So I knew it wasn't just flu. Because it was really weird like I my my nose hurts so bad burned, it was just a really weird it was like the worst sinus infection, you can have. And I was like this is not right, and they were like go home. So I don't know strange but but i'm glad I glad glad I got it cuz a lot of our folks that are coming in now in person don't have it, and some of them are getting sick and stuff so it's bad we're definitely in our area again. Even even with the vaccine, I still wear the mask if i'm out like at the store or whatever, because you just don't know I don't. yeah."
5974.0,Patient,"Because you can do it, you just don't get a list that is."
323.0,Provider,"Right. So, and do you have to sell for your groups or is that who does your question okay so she jokes she thinks that the masks are the new personas that we're like always going to. have them around and then like oh that's really funny to think about it, because you know it was there, those of us. Some people hate the thought of wearing the mask and she's like you know anytime anyone starts coughing or anything now in public we're all going to pull out our masks and we're just going to have. them on. Like yeah right so. So yeah but. So you're getting that stuff taken care of with the fire Marshal so that's good that that's keeping you busy. I don't like the symptoms about your hand i'm going to make a note about that, when do you have group next. Tuesday with Dr sell okay i'm going to send her a quick note to just let her know that you were at the er regarding the hand issue so that she can do some follow up just she might ask you just touch base with her Tuesday about how you're doing with that, and if you had any. Other follow up. about that, just so we know what's going on. With my pen. What else how's how's the family doing."
5974.0,Patient,pretty good on the meetup. At this restaurant called coaches that fall off. that's where my daughter works that really good they are me and my grandson and my dad that long.
323.0,Provider,"Oh good good. um so in terms of like the weekend the holiday weekend and stuff that doesn't. Like what the four rooms, open and stuff do you usually see slowness, now that the season is coming to an end, or will it pick up as it gets colder."
5974.0,Patient,Like what's the cycle of. Usually stays full but. there's there's been a couple people that stayed here that we're kind of in the shady and stuff. So I think yeah kinda. Like put us in a bad bracket. huh gonna. try to get it all situated around sorry I got a bunch of flies around.
323.0,Provider,"that's Okay, so are those folks gone now I mean."

323.0,Provider,"So, have you in those kind of cases, do you ask people to leave if you suspect there's not good behavior going on."
