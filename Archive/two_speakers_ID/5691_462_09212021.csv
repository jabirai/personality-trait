462.0,Provider,Good oh no.
5691.0,Patient,"I didn't go get tested because I just didn't want it, I was in the emergency room. before that. For me turn this off really quick. I was in the emergency room before that um. and Because I thought I had a kidney infection and I was like okay like and I bought it for whatever before. Big crazy. That had one before, and it was horrible. yeah and. They were like swamped with quote by a coma patients and they were like upset. Because they were like don't come into the to the emergency room we hate it when you guys come in here, because you get everybody else sick, you know and then really should just stay home and be sick, you know. chanda as. I start after I came home i'm like I was really careful because they said everybody like there was eight people that had posted in there and. So I was like not touching anything and like wearing my mouse the whole time."
462.0,Provider,yeah trying to be preventative.
5691.0,Patient,"I still got home and was still like I don't if I did get it wasn't horrible like some people, I know, like. A friend of mines sisters so sick she's I mean she's gonna go to the hospital today, probably because she's been sick for two weeks, just like."
462.0,Provider,"horrible horrible car yeah it's very different for everyone, like you said."
5691.0,Patient,Which is whatsoever me.
462.0,Provider,confusing and concerning.
5691.0,Patient,"For me, I just couldn't I couldn't get awake I could not stay awake for nothing like I slept for. Like a week, you know and just had kind of like a stuffy nose and kind of started with kind of like I thought I was going to get like a cold like a sore throat kind of cold. But I never got like no loss of smell or taste, I could still eat and I still had a little bit of an appetite horrible. yeah so sleeping is a challenge, like you said was. crazy I couldn't wake up to any alarm clocks nothing like that's why I missed our appointment, I was like."
462.0,Provider,Well i'm glad you're feeling better now.
5691.0,Patient,Like I said I know it's hit everyone different. yeah how are you.
462.0,Provider,"i'm doing good I wasn't feeling so well last week, which is why then you got rescheduled but definitely not coven feeling better now but."
5691.0,Patient,Is there code over in Ireland.
462.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah it's getting better now, but it was it was bad for a while there was a lot of rules restrictions, you know same thing up and down so."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah I know. I come out to my gun and. In other countries, they seem to be getting under control, better than we are. As well yeah now it's starting to get a little more under control. This is a huge second wave, I mean like in my little tiny town that I live in it's like. Everywhere, and then now because I didn't go in and get tested so i'm like. 100% for sure that that's what it is so i'm a little. i'm a little worried about like even going out, you know and doing anything like hearing, like my friends story about her sister like being that sick it's like. yeah I didn't have it, you know, but I don't know what else could cause you to be that. For a week."
462.0,Provider,"yeah no I mean it's worth being careful and cautious right but. This has been a challenging situation for everyone around the world it's very stressful anxiety provoking and. anxiety can actually bring your immune system down and make code words, so the best thing to. Stress right exactly, so the best thing to do is be careful, of course, but also try not to let it overwhelm."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah no I just I. Because I was such like a workaholic when I was my whole life honestly like and then, when I got sick and end up in the hospital and then. I there's nothing I could do about that I had to just stay in the hospital and Todd as well, and then getting home it's like I I knew i'd have to take some time to like adjust and. Buying my new norm, you know and then like find a balance, you know and so. And so I got home I didn't go back to work for a couple of months, and then covert started and so feet and the first doctor I hadn't doctor I had back then was kind of like. kind of freaked me out a little bit maybe have like a little bit of. What do they call it like when you like don't want to be around people at all like I don't know."
462.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
5691.0,Patient,"I was a hermit like totally cuz he's like do not catch coven and and like I would probably not make it, you know from it, because. high risk case and and. And so I just I didn't really do anything I just stayed home and I didn't work and and thankfully, I was able to do that, you know, but like. Now, and then after you know, so long as it's been such a long process, you know this whole thing's taken forever. I. guess maybe a little less worried about it, you know until the second wave came around i'm not as bad as I wasn't beginning, but I just. I don't know I. I don't want it to like get in the way of me doing things I want to do you know and like i'm I go see the cardiologist on. When not this Wednesday, not tomorrow, but the following Wednesday which i'm happy about cuz I hadn't seen a cardiologist since I was in the House."
462.0,Provider,Right yeah and I know that you were concerned about the medication and all of that.
5691.0,Patient,"yeah well and just I have to talk to them about the surgery, and everything and like even see if it's something that they're going to do. Right and which i'm sure it will be, but like my concern is is it, are they going to be like well you know you can you can deal with your heart being the way it is for another, you know five years you know it's just like i'd rather just get it out of the way. Sure, and have a better quality of life for more here."
462.0,Provider,that's very reasonable.
5691.0,Patient,we'll see what they say I don't know. i'm not a little bit. On your mind yeah definitely I. Think garfield.
462.0,Provider,you're cute I love it.
5691.0,Patient,"he's like maine coon so he's just enormous. But yeah and then I got mentored by litter box cuz I didn't want him to I mean I used to have a captain went outside and I was like that's great. I mean, he would never go and litter box so like I was just like okay fine he's been outside, so I got rid of litter box and now i'm thinking well crap because I had a really nice one like a really nice. And i'm like. A lot of money on it and I got rid of it and then now i'm thinking well winter's coming I don't know how he's gonna act in winter."
462.0,Provider,invest in another one or body. At trade.
5691.0,Patient,"Well yeah well i'm used to he's good about like going outside he doesn't go in the House at all, but. A pain in my butt that's for sure I just hope he doesn't. start going in the House, I mean I don't think they will capture usually pretty good about that, but. yeah and then my niece. Something kind of stressful because my niece lives with me and. she's 18 and everything and she went through some like health scare stuff like recently and. It was kind of. Like during the whole time that like right when I was starting to get sick and like starting to feel like fatigue and stuff and so. I had to kind of keep an eye on her because I was worried, it was like a life, you know it was something that possibly could take a turn for the worse like really quickly and. So that was kind of stressful."
462.0,Provider,yeah it is and let's see young age.
5691.0,Patient,"um yeah she's doing better now, though, thankfully it's just. Hopefully she'll. continue to get better."
462.0,Provider,yeah absolutely. kind of the top of your mind is the health.
5691.0,Patient,"let's listen and then I, I want to see her get some counseling to be good for her um but you guys don't see bright heart doesn't see anybody unless it's a suboxone patient right."
462.0,Provider,"or a pain patient Oh, we have mental health and pain and. Eating disorder and. Okay yeah yeah so anything in the mental health umbrella."
5691.0,Patient,Eating disorder so she. So she could potentially just calling see accounts.
462.0,Provider,"yeah okay absolutely and possibly if she wanted mental health medication as well, she could do that. So. one or the other, or both."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah good okay yeah I know that she she has ADHD to have since she was a kid I know that she hasn't been seeing a therapist and. A while and she hasn't been treated for that either, but. which does make it harder to focus to."
462.0,Provider,it's hard yeah when we do treat that.
5691.0,Patient,"yeah, which is something I needed to I made an appointment with Isaiah."
462.0,Provider,talk to him about that's right we talked about that. Last time with your ADHD where have you.
5691.0,Patient,"So it tends to get worse, like when i'm stressed out I definitely know that i'm trying to like calm down and do what you said last time, but it just doesn't I don't know me. yeah okay."
462.0,Provider,He wants to be article.
5691.0,Patient,"So uh. I you only see him at group, you know, and I made an appointment with them, and he was booked out pretty far. In the appointment that I made with them and I don't know why they they knew that he was going to be gone I don't know why they made the appointment for the day that they did that, and he left for a couple of weeks, so I had to reschedule so i'm seeing them on I think it's the first."
462.0,Provider,Okay.
5691.0,Patient,"that's coming up. yeah so i'm i'm curious to see how that's going to go and. And then, if I do start on medication and we'll see how that affects me hopefully it'll be a good balance and hopefully i'll be you know cuz i'm thinking about starting school so going back to work so."
462.0,Provider,yeah. You did mention that to have you had any more thoughts about which you mentioned some accounting maybe social work.
5691.0,Patient,"so hard I don't know like. You know even you went to college, can you take like can you go for your social working degree and then take like an elective his account like accounting or. Can you do something."
462.0,Provider,that's.
5691.0,Patient,"A good question yeah masters or a degree, would you like."
462.0,Provider,"In bowl you know you probably couldn't do both at once, but you could start with gen ED general education courses where you're just taking. Like a little bit of both and then kind of see which really sparks your interest right. You could do a bsw which is four years and then, when you have that you can do a one year social work program and a lot of schools, which is easy. not easy at all, but easier than doing it in seven or eight years right it gets it done in five and then I know accounting, you can do something similar like that too right if you go through from the start, make it more condensed."
5691.0,Patient,"I don't know how many years accounting, as I think it's. it's God, if you want to be a CPA i'm pretty sure it's X X or some."
462.0,Provider,"Talk to make like if you have a school in mind see if they have an admissions counselor or an academic counselor or something that maybe. I get a little bit of support from them to just figure out Okay, realistically, what is this going to look. Like for me is this getting. Four years, five years. Eight years right."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah because i'm thinking it's going to be probably winter quarter that I would even be starting so it's like i'm gonna have a little bit of time, but I do need to get the ball rolling at a Community college here in Colorado but it's. i'm not sure what all they even offer like Ideally I would love to be able to go into like an actual class like halftime and then part time do it online because I don't know if I. it's been so long since i've been in school that like I. i'm worried about like how the process is going to be having it be like all online, you know."
462.0,Provider,yeah yeah it's different it's it's a whole new world that we're all trying to adapt to.
5691.0,Patient,That and like with my ADHD i'm like how do I focus like if it's not I don't have like a. necessarily like.
462.0,Provider,A presence in front of you.
5691.0,Patient,So it's i'm just trying to rein in all these concerns you know.
462.0,Provider,"yeah I will be may be helpful to talk to the to an admissions counselor and then just you know again do some self reflecting and see what rather than stressing. out getting anxiety about it, try to just see what you're really feeling and what you know what those feelings lead you towards."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah for sure that's what i'm that's my plan I just. Now, with all the coven stuff i'm like and I just started feeling better like you know definitely cycling like myself again as like yesterday, like, I still kind of a little fatigued for. Just didn't feel like I had as much energy so now, I can kind of get the ball rolling on where i'm going with that and see where I go I kind of want to talk Isaiah to I don't know I guess i'm kind of a little bit apprehensive about. Like if i'm going to be starting any medication I kind of wanted to make sure. That i'm balanced out and everything works Okay, you know, I guess, which I think, which would happen by the time I would even start school, you know and winter. But. yeah we'll see."
462.0,Provider,So you've got.
5691.0,Patient,So many things up in the air that you're trying to.
462.0,Provider,Think through.
5691.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah and just been going to group and um. yeah it's weird like our group just keeps getting bigger and bigger to it's crazy.
462.0,Provider,Really.
5691.0,Patient,Just harrell over me yeah seems like it seems like our group is like. A lot of people bunch of new pm.
462.0,Provider,You nice to have a couple new perspectives every so often.
5691.0,Patient,"yeah and then, I have a friend that. her brother is. Going into treatment here soon and. He I only know from when I went into detox like I didn't I did. was trying to start the process with outpatient and then I ended up getting sick and all that and I relapsed and. long story, but um when I went to detox I had already had my prescription for suboxone before I went in, and so it was easy and seamless you know and they just had it there when I got there and. He doesn't have it set up or anything like that yet and so. They live way out of town, so I was like well, maybe it would be good for him so. I forgot to leave the phone number for him, but I think that's something he can do right like he could contact you guys and and you guys could help him treat him through his process of being in rehab and then, when he gets out."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
5691.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah okay. Okay cool then i'll let him know i'll give him.
462.0,Provider,"yeah definitely treat her that are in physical rehab facility, and you know we're."
5691.0,Patient,"cool Okay, have you guys ever like do you guys require like people that are in rehab to do. Like counseling and stuff with you guys."
462.0,Provider,"um you know it really depends if they have an outside counselor that they can sign an Roi a release of information that they do for proof, then they they wouldn't have to do the individual right. So if they can prove that they're already doing that, then no. But yeah just it depends on the person and what they're doing. Outside but, of course, yes, they are seeing a therapist already weekly, then it would make sense to put us on top of that."
5691.0,Patient,"Okay, just wanted some information forum second let her know telling. yeah because i'm happy for him i'm glad he's going to be going getting help and. he's already been like in the right process and living with her and getting sober you know and. Okay, he is sober so he's like doing what he needs to do now, but like he just needs he just wants to be cover all bases. sure."
462.0,Provider,I don't know that's fair it's it's better to have all bases covered and a plan right. The knot and then have some of the problems come up.
5691.0,Patient,"For sure yeah and then my good friend, I told you about the head, like the drinking problem that lives next door."
462.0,Provider,I was gonna ask about that too.
5691.0,Patient,"She is it's weird because, like I the girl that was living with her. They got me the job that I was doing i'm. Like I can't I just started questioning like if she was being honest, you know about everything, because you. Did it seems so weird you know, like if you can't stand all this stuff that shelley's doing to you why are you still there, you know, like sort of thing it's just strange it didn't add up. And i'm glad that I caught on to that when I did because she could have caused a lot more damage than she did. And I reached out to shelly just because I. You know she's we've been friends for so long, and I just it's to me it's just i'd rather at least have a conversation about it, and then we can you know either move forward or guards for ways that like I don't like having that like negative energy, you know. With somebody I care about and."
462.0,Provider,i'm sure.
5691.0,Patient,"And I wanted her to know that, like my concern came from the right place, you know, like it's it was all from love and concern and care, you know it wasn't any like negative feelings behind it, or animosity."
462.0,Provider,we're able to have that communication.
5691.0,Patient,And in we usually always are really good at communicating as long as she's. coherence.
462.0,Provider,he's sober enough right.
5691.0,Patient,"And surprisingly it's like when she came over she was over, and like she seemed very with it and. She was just confused, you know, with everything that I was saying, because it was. Most of it wasn't even true it's like obviously this girl was just and I was concerned, because I was friends with this this girl in high school, I was friends with her cousin and her family is kind of known for having a lot of mental illness, you know the women in her family and. I know her her cousin was a lot to handle you know and kind of was the same way, and so I was concerned, you know that it might be that way but she's very charismatic just like your cousin and you're very drawn in by these people and then. The same time it's like they just have nothing better to do than to cause. You know drama and and just a wave of negativity and you know where they go it's like it's just I don't get it, you know she could have had to. really good friends that would have been there for and supported her, and you know and tried to help her and instead it's like she pit us against each other and caused a bunch of you know bs that didn't need to be there, you know it's just I I don't understand it, but."
462.0,Provider,Right like. You got sucked into the bs that didn't meet. up and out of your care.
5691.0,Patient,"Well yeah you know and then like and i'm mostly mad to console she made it seem more worse than necessarily whether it's still but she's gotten a lot better so he's gotten way better recently, but like. that's good and she kicked her out like um but. it's just like it i'm mostly upset and angry just hurt by the fact that. She wouldn't what like what do you gain from making somebody be that concerned and that, like, I mean I was genuinely worried, you know and like. very concerned and and scared for my friend, you know because of all the things she was telling me, you know, to the point that I reached out to her parents, you know and and made it seemed like it was life or death, you know so which I mean in it."
462.0,Provider,"Sometimes it can. Be I mean you mentioned, she was very thin and not really eating and. That kind of thing all those teeny tiny and she did get really thin but um."
5691.0,Patient,"She looks way better now which so it's like I just. What she likes you know peeing blood, Melissa know like it's."
462.0,Provider,"It is, do you want to wait till you get to that point before expressing care and concern."
5691.0,Patient,"No absolutely not you know, but I just didn't feel like it needed to be. You know, in a way i'm not i'm not upset that I did tell her mom like there's an issue you know I mean I think her mom and dad already now you know. Like sure, but they're alcoholics as well you know so it's kind of like it's one of those things that, like the society just thinks it's okay it's so many people just. You know, like my even my friend that. Her her brother's going to rehab I was at her house two nights ago. I haven't seen her in a long time to school together and. we're catching up and everything and she lives, a little bit away from me and. She works at a restaurant bar, you know, and she got pretty bad into drinking for a while there, and she admitted it to me, you know and. She we were talking about she's gotten sober since and like she talked about it with me the other day and she's like you know I would tell my boss like. And you know tell my parents and tell my you know friends everything, like, I have a serious problem, like and it's like it was just nothing you know they just kind of like. yeah it's like. it's like that just blows my mind, you know, of course, I was never raised around like alcoholics my dad was an alcoholic, but it was before I was born so. Okay, I don't I know that I have had issues with alcohol, when I was younger like when I was younger, like, I think, but I never ever like I I would. go a little crazy and and drink a little too much you know, but I never had an issue getting off of it, or like just stopping you know it just so never got to that point with alcohol and now and i've never really enjoyed it in my adult years that much at all, but. Every now and then i'll have you know drink here and there, but. Sometimes every now and then like if i'm if i'm if the environments right like for me that's what it's all about getting the environment, you know I mean I would never drink that myself like. I just couldn't do have you been drinking with like me and one other person doesn't sound fun. But if it's like a big family get together something like that herpes you know, having drinks and stuff I might you know get kind of US or get a little drunk but that's few and far between anymore."
462.0,Provider,"So it seems like that we've come a long way with that, and you don't see that as getting in the way of your."
5691.0,Patient,"With addiction, otherwise hall is like for me for myself, you know but that's."
462.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5691.0,Patient,"But that's you know, everybody has their their crutch I guess or they're crossing they're like I. don't know but I mean boy like recently it's funny how like It just seems like in waves I just see so much like addiction, with certain substances becoming worse and worse they're like seem more prominent you know. And lately, it seems like alcohol has been like just in and it might be the Kobe you know steph."
462.0,Provider,"dimmick and the isolation, has had a lot of people turn to alcohol for coping is."
5691.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah crazy and so so bad, I mean I don't know, but you can just turn a blind eye to it, you know as much as they are when alcohol really has always been."
462.0,Provider,"Right, I mean it's legal. But again, if someone was having a hard drug. Like that blind I wouldn't be turned probably right, so it sometimes can go on and unchecked."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah. I just feel bad for people to actually do try to reach out and like. You know they admit that they have a problem, and like are in a way, like asking for help, or like. for helping ways and people just don't even just push that and I and and I could be also because that person that they're telling it to husband, an issue themselves that they don't want to deal with you know. Which is probably the case when it comes down."
462.0,Provider,"yeah right absolutely do you feel like when you were in your addiction, there was someone that advocated for you or. Try to blind guy."
5691.0,Patient,"Oh yeah for me, I was lucky because, like my. My mom my sister don't have any issues with addiction like they've never. Ever struggled with it, so I took after my father and that sense like. My mom my sister very similar so like gay they were really there for me, but the problem with that is like they were pushing you know for the positive change, and all that, but their approach, maybe might not be the best. I know that their intentions are you know. Writing, but that was often the case, what about their approach didn't work for you. Like a lot of. find it. In my addiction, not so much like now that i'm you know, in the process, I am now, but like. that a lot of people that don't have experience in it like i've never had me like I used to have this mindset like I would never see a therapist that had never actually. fought with addiction themselves, you know they just had a family member that did like or something and or a loved one that did that just how could they ever understand you know, and my mindset has changed on that, but like okay. But, like in back then, you know my thoughts on it was like well, then all they're doing is just really going off of what they're reading or what they're like seeing or what they're observing. And then that's that's kind of unfair and bias to say because it's like I mean I can. I mean there's plenty of things that I don't i've never experienced myself that I can empathize with and I."
462.0,Provider,emphasize what's true.
5691.0,Patient,"And I can understand, in a way, done enough to help you know, so I. My views changed on that, but they just a lot of it was like they just stuff they read on the Internet, like ways that they think I think that they could approach situations and stuff and. And i'm just so different than them, I guess, like um. I don't know like I mean they're their mindset was and then a lot of people's is is this way is that, like you have to cut yourself off from. Everyone that does any you know anything that isn't you know any sort of alcohol or drug or you know and it's just it's very. it's like I feel like yeah I first you do need to do that, you know, and you need to do self care and take care of yourself and just focus on. Until you feel like you, are you know strong enough but, like my dad was a big mentor and he helped tons of people get sober and. i'm happy after he got you know clean when he was younger and through his whole life until he died and that's all I hear about him, you know. All the years that he's been dead like is how many people that told me like they were just you know so grateful for him for helping you know them get through their sobriety and whatnot and. And I guess the one thing that really upset me and my mom said was. Because I have a he was my friend, you know, a long time and he's a good person very good person and. Probably one of the better people i've ever met you know just because he chooses to use drugs doesn't mean he is. A horrible influence you know, and I don't see him very often mean i'll talk to them here and there, but like he would never, ever, you know, like he knows that, like the fact that my situation was life and death, you know and like. That like I almost died and. If I were to. decision to go back to that lifestyle, I am potentially just I mean it'd be like slapping Bob in the face, you know for a second chance and. And he would never do that to me and it's just, I guess, because he lives across the street from my sister so like they've always known you know him and like kind of his lifestyle and stuff and. The like he was always there for me like if I if I needed like I don't know I didn't have a boyfriend for a long time and a man in my life, you know to like help me with things things like if I needed help like around here that. A man had to do you know it's like I could always call him he coburn he helped me. And I guess like they just wanted me to just be like no he's horrible in like in have the circadian as they did. You know and i'm just like i'm not going to think the same way as you guys do like I."
462.0,Provider,Just.
5691.0,Patient,Because there are some people that can you know be attics and be in the addiction and still be good people you know it's just they just haven't gotten to the level that you know I had yet.
462.0,Provider,it's gonna.
5691.0,Patient,"Be i'm not going to judge them, you know that would be so hypocritical of me like to do that I just and she said something along the lines of. What was it. kind of verbatim months I don't like that. When your dad was. At least your ducks I always make a point of saying things like my dad that i'm similar to my dad and that like. I wish my dad was here, he would understand me, you know, more so than they do like when we do get in these conflicts of interest, like we don't understand look and see things in the same viewpoint. and So she made this remark like about that, or at least your dad knew. When to. or something like when to cut ties with with people and for good and his family, always came first and that's that's all the in and I get that, like, I get the family comes first i'm not putting him before my family never you know but. I just and I was like well wait a minute i'm like you're acting like dad like just got sober and then Fuck you to like all of his you know friends that were still in the addiction and it's like. i'm not saying everybody that I was in you know, using with with my friend, like that's that's not true at all, but there's like. One or two that are you know, like struggling I guys still have very much love for and care for and I have to distance myself and I have that like if they needed me, you know, like i'm not gonna just like. I can't do that, like I just can't like. And I, and I like and I just had to tell her like i'm strong enough to handle that too, like I. And like I try to tell you he's not going to put me in that situation either like he would never let me like do that it's just relapse and make those choices and go back that lifestyle it's not like he's like rooting for me to do that, you know he's happy for. me but. yeah seems like it's a bit of a."
462.0,Provider,"pattern with your mom and sister as far as having differing opinions and then like you said you can see the care and the good intention there, but the expression of it. Just isn't in line with you and you don't and then you are right, like you said you don't have to have the same opinion and as everyone right it's good to listen and hear their concern, but you are correct, and that you're entitled to your own life and your own opinion."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I just I hate letting them down, you know it's like I know, like my whole life i'm."
462.0,Provider,guilty feeling.
5691.0,Patient,"i'm constantly like the black sheep and, like the problem child, you know I guess so it's kind of like I don't want to like be able to do the things that they want from me, and it would be like would be a lot easier if I could just. Give them what they want and be that person that they want me to be, but I just can't you know, like I. I wish they could like. accept that and not. automatically expect the worst. it's just gonna be like when you start thinking Those sort of things you start treating somebody like they're just going to fail. you're already setting them up for failure, you know. But. we'll see. And so, like I just told myself like eventually like. just keep doing what you're doing and like eventually they're just gonna have to. me and hopefully that'll stop and like go away they'll stop treating me like. Any need to. treat me like i'm a child, you know they'll just. actually have faith in me."
462.0,Provider,that's and.
5691.0,Patient,I know i'm.
462.0,Provider,sure.
5691.0,Patient,"You know I know I can see the other person. I can i'm not and I have no issues between that like I always try to put my you know my foot in the other shoe and like. I mean, I get it and that's why it's like I just I just keep trying to push through and like."
462.0,Provider,"gain your trust re establish that connection, but there is no doubt that it is hurtful and hard to always feel like the black sheep like you're making the wrong choice and like there. yeah i'll treat me like a child, like you said and expecting you to have every same thought and opinion. it's a hard place to be, and I can see it made you tearful."
5691.0,Patient,"Well, that and like I even like as far as relationships like I feel like I have such bad days in my past relationships that's horrible i'll admit it like it's bad. But. I sometimes feel like they would rather just see me do alone and not date at all. even try to put myself out there, because they have no faith."
462.0,Provider,The trusting again yeah.
5691.0,Patient,"No faith that i'm gonna pick somebody that's decent and it's just like. it's it gets exhausting sometimes, and I know it's a big issue for why, when I was younger I just would say Fuck it, you know, like and because there's only so much that you can handle you know and but i've gotten a lot better about it, you know and. I hadn't gotten better about like trying to. communicate those feelings to them, you know, like I don't know."
462.0,Provider,So you've held them in.
5691.0,Patient,explode.
462.0,Provider,"When they lied sure that that can be the thing is either held in or it comes to an explosion that isn't. productive, but like you said. you're holding on to this and that's a lot."
5691.0,Patient,"I feel like it you try to have a conversation with them about it. and get somewhere and like make progress, you know they. Once again it's like we just come to this like. stalemate of like we don't see things the same way and, like my ways the wrong way in their ways the right way and it's just it's a very one sided. view on things like me my sisters it to me it feels like my mom is way more judgmental and like just way more like. This is how right way to do things, and this is how things need to be, and if you're not doing this, then you're wrong, you know. And I get that, like my my sister she's that way too, but like not as bad she's just far more like critical like. You guys do family therapy."
462.0,Provider,"You know, in the right. circumstances we do family session sometime but it's not meant to be therapy for the family it's more to just bring it. together and kind of have the therapist Abba da. Right mediate and advocate for the patient, but you know it sounds like you. have a lot of feelings that are very valid based on again feeling like the black sheep like there's a lack of trust and it's wonderful that you can see, the other perspective that okay i've picked some. Some bad guys and i've made some bad choices, but also at what point do we all move forward and that seems to be. The question."
5691.0,Patient,"And I know it hasn't been like I mean. it's always this way with any with any like. Big trauma or anything that happens in a family, like it or any situation it's like a you can do one year of damage and it can take you know four years to prepare it sort of thing you know it's like. it's I get it, and then this sentence it's a lifetime of like issues you know between all of us, but like. I just I feel like you know there's nothing i've done so far that. As I mean I don't well that's not true, like as far as like my choices, sometimes, because I am so empathetic you get me in situations that like I. disappoint my mom or like you know things happen like you know just. feeling empathetic or trying to help others, you know, like when, in time, as any I just don't know how to be any other way, I try to explain to them no. I can't I don't expect you to understand is like I don't. physically mentally emotionally anything like. wrap my mind around just not being there for somebody in time of need, you know I just can't do it like and then sometimes that does get me in situations like I. don't turn out that great for me, you know what I mean like it's um. yeah like. Like every car i've ever owned has been told by like a manual."
462.0,Provider,You mentioned it before.
5691.0,Patient,"Especially like material boundaries and time boundaries and emotional boundaries. I have like gotten better about like. Getting like okay Well, this is the consequences of like if you know and something can always happen and with me, it always seems like so. I do understand that you know, and I have. gotten better about like being able to say, like you know I just can't you know, but as far as like. it's like I am doing the work I am trying to like improve these things about myself i'm trying to change, but like are they you know it's like I don't think so. it's just."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you want it to be a two way street and that you. improve and work on yourself and so today and that's fair that is fair."
5691.0,Patient,yeah I think we all need to bend a little bit you know in our viewpoints and. I.
462.0,Provider,"I hear you on that, so you recognize that you've made mistakes, you have some maybe boundary work to do, and also, they can work on their flexibility and work on meeting you in the middle, on some things like I said. A little on on opinions and thoughts and, in general, like you said not being treated like a child not feeling like the oddball the black sheep, the bad kid."
5691.0,Patient,"What you're. writing a letter like to them because i'm so much better I get so bad like when I have, like all these built up emotions and. Especially emotions that I haven't dealt with or like that I haven't been able to express and felt heard properly and I have tried to express them in the past, you know, but like just never feel heard. And much better at writing something like writing it down and then hoping that they hear it, you know be because, if I try to express it a lot of times I just shut down as soon as I get you know, like."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. that's a great idea I love that you brought that up and that you can recognize that writing works well for you, what would you think about writing the letter not sharing it yet, but maybe bringing it here and sharing it with me and then deciding. What I like to write it the content in it and process it and then think. What do you want to do with it right."
5691.0,Patient,"how's that. I can. Do and you can tell me like, if you think I should like, if i'm you know if I would have a better. A better you know if I worded things this way or if I didn't you know. that'd be helpful i'd appreciate that."
462.0,Provider,"I can do that yeah well, maybe that can be your little therapy assignment between now and the best time to think about getting that letter written and then sharing it."
5691.0,Patient,"yeah I don't get it all the way down before therapy, I think we have therapy next week I don't. get it all the way done by them and i'll just share with you what I have so far."
462.0,Provider,that's great it's better to take your time with it and be thoughtful and mindful about it than just try to scribble it and get it done so you can share with me. That.
5691.0,Patient,takes away the portal definitely it'll definitely take some energy so yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, it sounds like a really good plan a good short term goal there to process, some of these emotions that's a lot to hold on to, and you know you're not the bad kid you're not the black sheep. we've all been places you're you're good and you're worthy of not being treated like that and feeling like. yeah a good kid good person."
5691.0,Patient,"Well, I just feel like if you if you treat people, the way that you like. Even if they aren't necessarily it doesn't necessarily you think of them if you treat them like they're that they will."
462.0,Provider,Year yeah you.
5691.0,Patient,know I.
462.0,Provider,know.
5691.0,Patient,Law of attraction.
462.0,Provider,"yeah it is, if you think about like the bad kid in. School the kid who was I hate to even say that word, but the kid who was maybe always acting out or maybe even had at your struggles at home, they were always treated bad put it in the corner and all that and, like you said it just perpetuates the cycle so you're good insight there."
5691.0,Patient,"And I think along in the bigger scheme of things it's like we all just need to learn to love each other, a little bit more."
462.0,Provider,yeah oh you got muted I think you're getting a call.
5691.0,Patient,"Okay, but yeah okay."
462.0,Provider,"Well, bring some of that love back onto yourself that you said I know we all need to learn, sometimes it takes. Longer for others, but you can give it back to yourself right so that'll be another goal for now."
5691.0,Patient,yeah I can do that.
462.0,Provider,When I see you in on the 28th which is next week at 1pm do you got that down.
5691.0,Patient,"And then. You know, go to the cardiologist the next day after that so."
462.0,Provider,"All right, good so you've got."
5691.0,Patient,To see you read it well.
462.0,Provider,"yeah okay. All right, good well good work thanks for your vulnerability today and i'll see you next time okay. Take care."
5691.0,Patient,Just about in the wrong spot.
462.0,Provider,"All right, for transcription, can you please note that her short term goal is to write a letter to her sister and mom about all of her built up feelings and bring it to therapy to process before. sharing it with them and then also to redirect some of the love she wishes, she was getting from them by giving it back to herself, thank you."
