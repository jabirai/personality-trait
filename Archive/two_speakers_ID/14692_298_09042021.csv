A pretty short visit i'm going to ask you a few questions. Like how did you. get into the hospital what was."
14692.0,Patient,"It also to I just want i'm Suzanne sister and. The one of the reasons why we were intensive on getting this appointment sooner rather than later, is because we had a couple questions about the prescriptions. And in particular we're running out of the bends tripping because we're you know it's three times a day it looks like we basically about 20 days worth of held all. 20 days left of the boot propre on and and 20 days left of the met methyl full late, but the bends tripping we have like four days left and that's three a day. So I was nervous, because it does seem to help, so to speak, and I didn't want a unit, you know I didn't want to run out and we wanted to get that prescription renewed if that's possible."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, it is."
14692.0,Patient,"Okay, great thanks Oh, and another question about is it Okay, for her to take motrin with these drugs or yesterday, I mean."
298.0,Provider,yeah it's OK.
14692.0,Patient,OK OK OK.
298.0,Provider,So what were the circumstances of your admission to the hospital.
14692.0,Patient,"Well i'm not totally sure, because my memory isn't what it was previously Okay, I guess, I had I don't know what you would call it like right i'm. A bit manic verbally and physically I wouldn't use that word okay well i'm just very agitated. Oh you're right because i'm not using the word manic clinically obviously just very agitated verbally and physically."
298.0,Provider,"Okay we're used to assign a little. No Okay, and do you know your mental health diagnosis, did they give you one."
14692.0,Patient,"They said there wasn't one because it was a one off well, he said was that the diagnosis was major depression and with a single episode severe."
298.0,Provider,"Have you ever been in a mental hospital before, no, no Okay, do you have an outside psychiatrist."
14692.0,Patient,not yet no.
298.0,Provider,"Alright based medications new to you, are you on medicines before you went in."
14692.0,Patient,"Well, no they're completely new and honestly one of them prevents me from having any memory of all I have to ask you know. When when it was and sort of like no short term memory and then really hard for me to call up language as well. So."
298.0,Provider,You know which medicine is doing that to you.
14692.0,Patient,"know I really don't because i'm supposed to take them all together, or you know at least two or three at a time."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
14692.0,Patient,"So I don't know, but I do. think that that my physical or just my mental ability to remember incidents and words this i've never had that problem before so something's happening."
298.0,Provider,Now. Are you.
14692.0,Patient,know that was not on the prescription. That was for the discharge that's not God.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. That makes sense. and Spencer trucking, also known as coach denton and what does that help with."
14692.0,Patient,"Well, it seems that sometimes Suzanne feels. Like a keenness in her limbs that a little bit of a drawing up or 20 sensation or tingling and in her in her joints little bit enos and. I assume that's what the white pills of infallible ideals, but the best roping was for was to kind of reduce that side effect i'm assuming that the health off. And or in maybe the appropriate so. So it just it feel like when she takes that pill, you know, most of the time it takes away those side effects and she can sleep."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. that's wonderful and you're right, it does do it takes away the side effects of the hell dog. Has there been any paranoia delusions. hallucinations going on."
14692.0,Patient,"No, no, no right okay."
298.0,Provider,And how is your sleep.
14692.0,Patient,"Well, in the place, you know, in the hospital it wasn't so great, because. I was just. I know, maybe it was sort of Okay, but. Anyway, right before I went to the hospital, I was not sleeping as well as I should I guess. But then the hospital is really hard to sleep because of all the. You know the TV blaring and that radio going on and it's just like kind of hard to sleep under those conditions, but I tried, as much as I could. And then, then here at home it's then i'm on and off it's a it's a little bit 5050 some nights sleep almost 12 straight hours and fill out and get up and feel good. Other nights again when she has a twitching this or joints and has to kind of have a pill like that then stroking halfway through the night, it can be more like seven hours worth asleep, and then a nap during the day. it's been I mean before this whole thing happened Suzanne was not used to you know getting much sleep, I mean you know, maybe six hours a night. And then, it was like it's really me in some ways it's been great she's been able to sleep the solid like 12 or 10 hours or something like that. Right I don't really agree with the depression diagnosis, because i've never had severe depression and I didn't feel like what like what do you call it the episode, I had it wasn't because of depression so."
298.0,Provider,Okay did it feel more like bipolar and feeling manic.
14692.0,Patient,"No that's why I don't really like the diagnosis man, I know, and obviously that was just a word I use and I apologize for that suzanne's never the whole this whole thing with this incident is she's never behave like that, before in your life."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and any triggers. Any life events go on."
14692.0,Patient,No.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, what is your living situation says them."
14692.0,Patient,"Well, I usually live with my mom here at this House and stephanie is Cisco. And right now well my mom staying up in San Francisco and I came down here to help."
298.0,Provider,Okay. What are your stressors in life system.
14692.0,Patient,"Well, I have a lot of projects that I work on both in music and other areas and i'm assuming that it was created, because lack of sleep. i'm not sure it was a trigger you know I mean, so I think it's just a simulation of things I. mean that's why it's i'm more concerned about the effect of some of these drugs where i'm not able to think you know. And i'm not even remember, because those are texting very that to my two best traits certainly honestly that I would have an ability to remember things in. You know so it's just kind of strange that you know those words are being used because I really don't agree with it."
298.0,Provider,"Can you use, can you tell me the dosage of the benzo tripping."
14692.0,Patient,yeah it's um one milligram and it's one tab every eight hours.
298.0,Provider,As needed.
14692.0,Patient,"It does I don't think it says as needed it just as one tab every eight hours, I mean. If she gets a twitchiness or joints sometimes we it's it's a six hours and then you know we're not always exact with that."
298.0,Provider,"What are your strengths, is in."
14692.0,Patient,in what areas.
298.0,Provider,"Oh good question, what do you like about yourself."

How do you say it's just such I can't call it language, right now, but I think i'm. i'm very aware of the process that i'm using and it's always important to me within my writing and. So. I don't know about strength as much as busy as definitely the most favorite first mindful to prison whole world yeah but what was the question again."
298.0,Provider,yeah Just what do you like about yourself.
14692.0,Patient,that's kind of a strange question for me because I don't feel like I have certain traits I feel like it's just part of my. I don't know just part of my life.

I haven't had a lot of time to do them recently, but I have a lot of different exercises that I do isometric type exercises and stretching exercises and I like to swim or do the bike you know. So. And I was been swimming these past three or four days. Before I was hospitalized so I mean just swimming. We live in a hot sort of place so usually by. The last part of April, through September it's a good swimming time for me okay."
298.0,Provider,What are your eating habits any special diets.

298.0,Provider,"So before this hospitalization and I think I asked this question, but I just want to clarify had you been on any mental health medications antidepressants in your in your past nothing. So. For appropriate on is used for dopa mean, which is really wonderful to give you, energy and to help you stay focused and. it's one of my favorite drugs it's it's also called wellbutrin but the hell doll is what's kind of concerning to me because you're having some memory lapses, and my concern is it's the hell doll that might be doing that, do you know why they put you on health oh."
14692.0,Patient,I don't actually have I.
298.0,Provider,So okay oh. You do right no.
14692.0,Patient,"No well again my sense was a lot of agitation. On and the. And I think there was again when susie and had to be hospitalized I think there were hallucinations. Okay, like, and I think there were. Hearing things and. You know added difficult to communicate with Sudan, at that time and to. Really engage into."
298.0,Provider,"That helps me a lot, I appreciate answering that so."
14692.0,Patient,"I will say this, though, that Suzanne even in the hospital and here has complained she pulls the medication and i'm assuming as the elbow it feels very heavy it feels very. You know I kind of assumed that throughout this process that sort of drug would be stepped down. i'm gradually. yeah and I wouldn't mind not taking it doesn't offend you, but I kind of blows me out. Constantly what you know so so again, whatever see but I assume that's kind of would be the thing that would have. To do."
298.0,Provider,"Right right um What would you like to do for your mental health as far as Let me give you some options, I can. I can give you a referrals to an in person psychiatrist around you. You can join our program our program is. You see a therapist unless you have an outside therapists you see a therapist that's done once every other week you go to group therapy that's done for one hour once a week. And then you have access to myself for prescribing medications were a mental health program so I can't divide things up. Is this something you're interested in, or would you be interested in referrals to a psychiatrist psychiatry. What."
14692.0,Patient,"Other any other options, besides that."
298.0,Provider,"um well I could give you referrals for an Inpatient an intensive outpatient Program. I can give you referrals for therapy. But because you're on medication you kind of need to be monitored by psychiatry it for the medication, you can see, if your regular family doctor will oversee your mental health care that's another option, you have."
14692.0,Patient,"Well i'm going to do therapy is it's like so so we understand the psychiatry needs to be involved to monitor the medication. And I think. Would it be possible for us to get back to you because maybe we should just think it through. You know, like you've got a program that would include like a psychologist or therapist group therapy and then having access to yourself as psychiatrists for medication. Production over time. Or it sounds like we could just engage psychiatry just on our own through the referral that. You really did you get it and therefore then whatever therapy Suzanne want to do that's on her own and we can arrange for that on our own that it's not just sort of mandatory through the program is that."
298.0,Provider,"You were almost right on everything. So nothing is mandatory like, even if I give you referrals if you don't call those, then you don't call them but nobody's going to make you call them."
14692.0,Patient,"right but, honestly forces ian's health I I mean I I think we've got to have a psychiatrist monitoring the medication. Correct."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've got a little bit of time to. You know you've got a little bit of time, so find somebody."
14692.0,Patient,"Okay, so, then in terms of the Benz trophy. Like how like would you give us a pretty good refill so that we can have at least two or three weeks to find somebody."
298.0,Provider,"I gave you a month, I gave you a 90 tablets."
14692.0,Patient,"Okay, so that's really good and is that going to be at the walgreens then that we gave your people, the."
298.0,Provider,i'm going to tell you exactly where it is i'm sure that's it's walgreens on. A horrible I can't say it topanga.
14692.0,Patient,"yeah exactly yeah. Great okay so that's good so isn't it, I think, maybe what we should do is just discussed this and then. I don't want him to like talk therapy or okay. Okay, then it sounds like the braveheart program is not what we would do."
298.0,Provider,that's okay that's okay what i'm gonna do is i'm going to request to pull together what your insurance would pay for for you to go for psychiatry.
14692.0,Patient,"Okay okay and what's that what is the name of sessions a psychologist will like again so. Dr Escobar is a psychiatrist and you would have to continue to see a psychiatrist, at least for like short sessions like this, so they can work on your medication and step it down over time, so you could do it. Yes."
298.0,Provider,"It can be done, most of them are doing remotely. I myself am a psychiatric nurse practitioner, which means that. i'm under a psychiatrist, but I still prescribe just, just to clarify sorry."
14692.0,Patient,"All the details okay. I think that that works and to the interview is the bright hard Program. Essentially, would would entail therapy and group therapy. Direct don't want that right Okay, so that then I don't think we want that So then, if you could send us some referrals and for the psychiatrist. That would be awesome also if you have like anybody in cases and you know does want to talk to a psychologist you know somebody who's who's really cool we'd prefer like your you know your favorites list on on any for both actually is, this is, this has been a difficult a difficult time."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I I am on it right now, it was nice to meet you Suzanne and the sister. And thank you for taking the time you've met your requirement for. Your insurance okay."
14692.0,Patient,Great Thank you so much.
298.0,Provider,Thank you. bye bye. She has a. monitor low suicidal risk great she says.
