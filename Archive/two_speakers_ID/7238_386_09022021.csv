7238.0,Patient,I checked in at 1240 for a appointment I. don't know until two o'clock before I finally decided if.
386.0,Provider,"I get that it does look like here what they did do is they marked it out as a cancellation versus a no show so because they knew that you had checked in so early. They were having some system errors, it looks like here so i'm getting notification that you're needing the diazepam prescription order correct."
7238.0,Patient,"Yes, I depleted on my medication."

386.0,Provider,So sorry.
7238.0,Patient,Current current minutes like still super.
386.0,Provider,I bad.
7238.0,Patient,Since i've been home i'm like artist know this because.
386.0,Provider,All the right view any type of like topical like benadryl or anything like the for like I know I mean not much could help when you're allergic anyways but um do they prescribe anything like that for you.
7238.0,Patient,They just told me to take them to jail over the counter.
386.0,Provider,"So they do have they have a benadryl spray it works fantastic, I have four kids they have a benadryl spray it's topical you just spray it on and then you can rub it in. And that may be helpful for you, that way you don't you're not getting like that drowsiness to on top of it for everyday function but that's an option, I I tend to advise on all patients to kind of steer clear of story to use like high. hydrocortisone, even though it can be used as an Anti itch because it staring use can actually send out your skin so with with it already being compromised your skin being compromised I don't recommend that but definitely look into the benadryl spray."
7238.0,Patient,Or the topical areas bad at 25 years ago when.
386.0,Provider,"Right that's the same thing that's how I feel i'm where was that, when I was getting stung is what my thing is, and I have, I mean my my oldest is 14 my youngest is seven at this point and it's been it's been a godsend and then a trope benadryl spray so they don't have to take anything."
7238.0,Patient,"yeah I just together my son, that is because of that got his face to they may get the."
386.0,Provider,"heebie jeebies I get that. So it looks like here, I have you currently in our program for mental health, as well as your cohort for physical house on your. doctor's appointments are scheduled with Dr celador I can tune day it looks like you're all of your surveys are up to compliance standard now what the recommendation is. i'm going to actually take a look here, did you sign a release of information for us to get the hospital records."
7238.0,Patient,"No, not yet."
386.0,Provider,"Okay, I will send an email to you for the release of information that we were able to get those records what they do have in here is that they know showed your individual therapy appointment on 824 when were you in the hospital."
7238.0,Patient,I was in I see then.
386.0,Provider,"At that time, so once we get the records, they may be able to change that to like a cancellation, because obviously you can't do much when you're in icu and so. let's see if we can get that reversed, they did cancel out the appointment for the MED follow up one on one today, and so, and I know that Dr. There was a message that was sent a doctor cell regarding that the care navigators issues with their system for them not to be able to check you in appropriately. So they did mark it out as cancelled, you have another MED follow up scheduled on the 14th of September individual therapy, I have scheduled until. September 8 for you um and what Dr cell would have typically done is get you the prescription to go over to the next appointment, so what that's that's exactly what i'm going to do. For you just make sure that you go to the individual therapy appointment on the eighth okay. let's take a look here, so we have the 1471 23456 713 days total, let me take a look at the previous script. yeah, let me just send in. A bit more math here. i'm going to send in a 14 day supply for you okay."
7238.0,Patient,"Thank you. Oh, my gosh."
386.0,Provider,"No, not your fault, not your fault whatsoever, they took accountability for what had happened so that's even better for me to be able to adjust it accordingly. Typically, right now, what the protocol is is that I would only be expected to be able to bridge you to individual therapy, but because you would have seen today. and Dr cell would have ended up sending in most likely a 30 day supply for you, because that's what you've been on I I can I can do, up to the next point for with Dr sell know. hang tight well I just i'm going to leave audio for just a moment, while I colon the bed, and then i'll let you know what pharmacists, I spoke with once I get off the line with them okay."
7238.0,Patient,"Thank you, dear."
386.0,Provider,you're absolutely welcome give me one moment.
7238.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
386.0,Provider,"Just still on hold with them, Michelle Lee just give me one just a little bit longer here i'm just on hold, I can't hear you."
7238.0,Patient,Okay yeah they're severely understaffed.
386.0,Provider,No worries i'll be on hold until they pick up the line so.
7238.0,Patient,That takes an hour sometimes.
386.0,Provider,It is what it is.
7238.0,Patient,So you don't have to listen to the dogs bark. might come back I don't tell gun.
386.0,Provider,"alrighty are you still with me miss shelley. Yes, perfect after that long hold there I spoke with dustin pharmacist of that. CVs pharmacy he went ahead and took a verbal I caught it in for 60 days for a quantity of 24 for you, and that is to get you over to the appointment scheduled on the seventh. OK OK, and then, if there's any additional needs that you have please don't hesitate to log right back into the rx triage and when it comes to prescription needs, and I do apologize for all the mishaps that had occurred today."

386.0,Provider,alrighty hang in there and then I would give them a phone call and about 1520 minutes if you'd like to see what time you could pick up if they're that understaffed I always recommend going in they usually tend to work a little bit faster when you're right in front of them. So.
7238.0,Patient,"said, who used to was the only person back there."
386.0,Provider,"The poor guy um he seemed he seemed rather Russian busy so. You know, it is, I get it we've i've worked in clinics, where we're completely understaffed and sometimes just not capable of fulfilling the need, so I get it it's hard to the medical world sometimes but you know we push through."
