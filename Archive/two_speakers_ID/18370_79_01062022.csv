18370.0,Patient,yeah no i'm good oh.
79.0,Provider,let's do that let's find a meat go till four. So how How are things going this I mean you've been basically a week and a half. You know what the meal. All still so new.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's good like. How we have the password and like oh i'm like it's terrible i'm doing so terribly but i'm like really trying to not. be like okay it's like all or nothing just slowly slowly working on it um so there have been days, where like I didn't do cereal cereal and popcorn and I like follow the more consistent meal plan. or I. followed the meal plan and then still had certain popcorn just had like a smaller amount um. But then they're also days were like still kind of relying on it, but i've been working a lot on lunches and those have been good good i've been having like i've been making omelets which is like breakfast. or like Turkey rap sometimes and yesterday. was good, because I went out for lunch. And for dinner with my friends oh sorry if i'm frozen I don't know."
79.0,Provider,you're good um.
18370.0,Patient,"But that was good, because then I kind of got out of my oh i'm good now okay yeah yeah I don't ever want a little more and yeah so yeah just recap everything I talked yesterday with CARA Lee about. i'm. Like working on changing the popcorn zero behavior so it's not always like the same and like. watching some the watching a different show or like doing it somewhere else. or putting everything in a bowl so i'm not just like eating out of the bag all the time. And I feel like those those will definitely be helpful because it's easier than like completely cutting it out."
79.0,Provider,Okay awesome that's good and where well did we decide not to have you write down your food or record it and the.
18370.0,Patient,"I was having trouble with the recovery record APP. Go I like half the code that you sent me, but when I say when it says connect it says like. Invite clinician am I supposed to. invite you to join something."
79.0,Provider,yeah you just invite me.
18370.0,Patient,"Oh OK. OK, then I will do that um but yeah so that's kind of what's been happening."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, I was just looking on the recovery record, so I. I haven't seen you on there, so you just haven't connected it right."
18370.0,Patient,No yeah.
79.0,Provider,yeah go ahead and. do that now and try and settle.
18370.0,Patient,So.
79.0,Provider,ski.
18370.0,Patient,yeah so. I just have to type in you're.
79.0,Provider,Such a hurry.
18370.0,Patient,Okay.
79.0,Provider,awesome good.
18370.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"I can kind of see on a day to day how you're doing. And we don't have to do that forever. Because it's it's not normal. To track your food, something I wanted. You to do for your life for anything but it can be helpful information just."
18370.0,Patient,Temporary yeah yeah at this point.
79.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean you've kind of described the last week described from me just a little bit more like I don't know you're eating your own let this one, and you have an omelet."
18370.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"And kind of described to me. You know just. from looking at the eating, you know."
18370.0,Patient,"um that's always good because it's something that I know and it's something that's consistent and like whether I tried to or not I usually know the exact nutrients of pretty much everything going into it so because it's more comfortable it's easier. But there was also a time like within the past couple of months, where I would have been like I don't want to have that moment, because if I eat this Alma i'm going to want less cereal milk or not. My entire day was revolved around eating cereal and popcorn so it's definitely progress, but I still like kind of know what's going into it. Which is why yesterday was good, because. With like going out with friends. I didn't know anything about what I was eating and when i'm with them like with people. That aren't like my family members that can know what's going on, I try and like seem normal around them so then. I eat more and I. do get better I guess. And that makes makes sense, by the way, I just want to."
79.0,Provider,Like it makes sense.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah like trying to mimic them and, like blend into the crowd I guess. yeah."
79.0,Provider,"awesome Okay, I still want you to describe to me your eating experience I. You know I mean just from you know where where were you sitting, you know what how long did it take you what did you. What can you remember from this morning, I mean maybe lunches better what did you have for lunch."
18370.0,Patient,I had a wrap let's.
79.0,Provider,"Maybe let's do the rap that was sooner I just described the eating, just like kind of like pretend like i'm a sociologist and I want to study the society, our society."
18370.0,Patient,So okay.
79.0,Provider,i'm.
18370.0,Patient,"Just I need the and. eat it well, I watched YouTube and I like that, because it's like a set amount of time where i'm just like Okay, I can eat it during this like 15 minute video. And i'm done, and then I go like back to whatever i'm doing and i'm I don't know what else I eat it in the Center, which is the room that i'm in right now. This is usually like where I spend, like the majority of the day."
79.0,Provider,It seems lovely.
18370.0,Patient,"I think yeah I do a. lot apparently it was like an empty room forever and then they finally like put stuff in it, when I left so now I just like hanging out in here and do my work and stuff. um yeah so I usually eat like breakfast and lunch here and then dinner I eat with like my family if it's not an I O P day. It was good, I don't know a play to kind of know what to expect with it."
79.0,Provider,yeah okay.
18370.0,Patient,But it was yummy I like the consistency of it.
79.0,Provider,"Before you, you know, while you were making it or just before you're making it were you looking forward to it did you notice kind of that interested in food hunger."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah No, I do look forward to it on the days, where I skip it, I sometimes miss it and then i'm like Oh, I should have I should have had it, but then I also sometimes like, but this makes puckering cereal, even better, when I don't have food dread that when I only have dinner or."
79.0,Provider,They have that bumps up.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah and then it makes that better, but then i'm like going to bed so full because I just ate so much like almost all my calories for the day in one sitting. yeah. So good I don't know."
79.0,Provider,When you were done the rap What did you then do.
18370.0,Patient,"I then started looking at my silver by for my classes and then I just like wrote down my assignments over there, like the dates that i'll have."
79.0,Provider,Okay cool well again i'm.
18370.0,Patient,"Sorry, thank you for playing the."
79.0,Provider,sociologist cool.
18370.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
79.0,Provider,it's my freezing again.
18370.0,Patient,"It was. Just like catches up and works again, so I don't know."
79.0,Provider,"that's so weird Oh, and I do see your invite link."
18370.0,Patient,Excellent oh perfect.
79.0,Provider,"Great um let's say saying oh so just you know just to kind of give students place. And what did that soon allow you to do you know after eating What did it do for you, I guess, or what is your assumption that it's doing for you."
18370.0,Patient,"um I mean I think in a lot of ways, it just allows me to like slow down and relax because it like I don't know it kind of like I don't know if that's wrong or like. I not the right way of thinking, but it kind of does because it's like Oh well, when I definitely have the popcorn so for it cereal for sure it's like. carefully described it as like my beer, at the end of the night like it's just my way of slowing down and relaxing and like I thought that was so true."
79.0,Provider,I agree.
18370.0,Patient,"Right like ladies 100% true. But even like with my meals it's like Okay, I can stop working or stop doing what i'm doing like chill out watching TV he learned about whatever. Yes, then on days, where I restrict them like oh i'm busy I don't have time to do that."
79.0,Provider,"correctly okay I, I want to go back to something you kind of said, you said I don't know if that's okay or not right or not. Why do you think that is that that you question that that's kind of. Natural. sumption from it, which is right, by the way, and oh you're frozen, can you hear me."
18370.0,Patient,I can.
79.0,Provider,Just kind of.
18370.0,Patient,Oh sorry it might be.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and what was I saying okay so yeah, why did you kind of, say, well, I don't know if that's right or not, why do you think that sort of questioning whether food should be relaxing and rewarding."
18370.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know because well. I kind of caught myself with a lot of things so it's not like super out of the ordinary okay. um I don't know I guess i've always heard like food you shouldn't use food as a reward like with kids and stuff and like I don't know it's like more like oh it's like fuel it's not like, well, it can be a tree I don't know it's just. feels wrong to be like."
79.0,Provider,"that's how I relax yeah. yeah I can totally see you've experienced society's pendulum swings and at one point, you know, maybe people were rewarding kids too much with food, but food should definitely be a reward sometimes right. yeah it's not illegal, the way to reward kids but it's okay to have it as a reward to be like hey like you didn't get any. cavities let's go get you in food at whatever restaurant you want, whether that's McDonalds maybe like top of time I don't you know."
18370.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"The different things and be like hey let's celebrate and do something fun that we don't usually do is is totally okay and. yeah new food. Particular food taking that time to eat it should be a time to relax and enjoy and just take a breather. meant to be that way, and part of our culture attack that and make that see not okay."
18370.0,Patient,Probably at a lot of ways i'm in like making it I don't know making people too reliant on the reward or like shameful about using it as a reward maybe. yeah.
79.0,Provider,"it's almost like you, not only do you need to be a good worker or a good student like you need to be a good eater like you need to be like that, following these guidelines and people honestly know too much about nutrition now okay."
18370.0,Patient,where's your. Mother right.
79.0,Provider,it's become a burden and it's taken some of the fun out of it and.
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, I didn't know the calories and."
79.0,Provider,"Right. And that actually. hurts our health. Because it raises stress level, but just raising stress levels do."
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, probably leads to more like bad behaviors."
79.0,Provider,"yeah bad behaviors or meeting well the reason for the bad behaviors is needing to compensate for the stress right. relieve the stress. And cortisol cortisol is is what comes with stress it starts to flow all throughout our body, it brings in inflammation which inflammation causes all kinds of problems, so we know that. Having some gentle nutrition and some little bit of guides and you know paying attention to your body is good but. Over paying attention and being too strict with nutrition actually hurts people's help it doesn't help it and it's that you don't want to go too far with pendulum you want to kind of keep it little in the middle, but."
18370.0,Patient,it's yeah yeah sure definitely.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, my place I go back. And the. Society like you've been a kid growing up in this society and you've done your job of learning and that's normal to absorb what society is teaching us but I, but I love the inherently you do that eating was an opportunity for me to just kind of."
18370.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,it's meant to be so good job. No feeling shame or bad in that.
18370.0,Patient,You do Sir sorry I feel a little bad i'm like guilty.
79.0,Provider,Such a stinker.
18370.0,Patient,Hopefully now anything else i'm sorry.
79.0,Provider,"No it's okay. yeah the Internet looks Okay, it might be on your end I don't know or maybe. Maybe maybe mine is pretending to be all fast."
18370.0,Patient,"My brand at, but it was like. I said, if. You feel."
79.0,Provider,"Okay yeah if you do start to feel shameful, we need to know what to do with those thoughts. Are those feelings or impressions because it's there, we have to recognize. yeah, and so one one way and maybe Kelly has already kind of given an example of this. Like you know I see you, I see that thought or that kind of pressure that I should be being more productive in this time I see you and it's okay i'm going to take some time I have time and. yeah what I what I tell people a lot of times, especially people who are in charge of of me bills or in charge of places where people eat is, are we an advanced society, or are we not, why are we rushing around and not taking time to eat, are we. Do we have a problem with you know. Currently in America you you think, by the way people act around food that we would not be an advanced society we don't eat like it."
18370.0,Patient,We don't.
79.0,Provider,"train and enjoy it and relax for a minute I mean have we gotten to a point where we can relax or not, you know that's what I often ask those people will show it that show that yeah we have all kinds of luxuries, and we have the luxury of taking 20 to 30 minutes to eat."
18370.0,Patient,"Oh yeah you're ready, we saw it."
79.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's really strange, especially like in school."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah and like that's another I don't. Oh sorry i'm talking over you i'm Sorry, I think it was like. frozen oh it's just the computer go for it. Oh well, yeah I just feel like from rushed i'm like there's no point like if it's not going to be relaxed like i'm not gonna like quick either crowbar the cars, like if I can't enjoy it and, like experience it I just don't want it."
79.0,Provider,yeah you're connecting to the authenticity of what the food experience should be really cool.
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, you were. Born yeah oh yeah oh that's good."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and so little little side thing, but I just kind of wanted to talk about that with you, and so this week, what do you feel like is the most important thing for you to work on for a meal plan eating in general."
18370.0,Patient,"I don't know i'm going back to school so. Like my habits are pretty pretty like concrete there of like dinner, you have popcorn cereal you go to bed you do it again. And so that's gonna be like my immediate response of like the easiest thing to do, because that's what i'm."
79.0,Provider,Going back to the same apartment and everything right.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah same everything. My apartments definitely stocked with awkward and. So it's there. And I don't think I can get there, and be like oh never having a scan, but I do want to like start moving towards a more relaxed like way of living and not end like I just it was like. I don't know just so so set in my ways of like the way I was living and I was also starting to like one day a week, I would like restrict my calories and track them and I don't like doing that and I don't want to do that. So I just don't i'm just trying to avoid those things getting gone."
79.0,Provider,"yeah so what I mean, how are you going to do that what's imagine you know it's the day of going back there. You probably won't get there till later in the day, correct. yeah so the next day let's just go with the next day, so the next morning you've just left in your apartment you know bedroom for the first time since being back you wake up in the morning. What do you."
18370.0,Patient,"Well, like. I think the best thing would be to at least have lunch like, even if I make like a good like just lunch, I can make like a big omelet like with tons of stuff in it. i'm somebody that I know and then."
79.0,Provider,yeah I.
18370.0,Patient,"heard this in the dining hall I so it's weird I have a dining plan, but I live off campus I just didn't really trust myself to like cooked and do all or my own. So I just got it in case but I that's like been so helpful for me, because I can like get things I don't know how they were made good things I don't know the gym."
79.0,Provider,"and move on, that would be some wet somebody making for you."
18370.0,Patient,yeah I would have to make it what I know yeah. The only I would probably make it would make it yeah so but I do the dining Hall for dinner most right yeah yeah so I can make.
79.0,Provider,You have all those ingredients for the omelet when you've been gone for so long. Or would you be going.
18370.0,Patient,"To get back. yeah i'd have to go yeah i'd have to go like right when I get back, but i'll probably do that anyways because i'll have my car and then I could just go to the grocery store come back. yeah if I yeah when I get this pies I can make like an omelet and I think that's realistic enough. Where I can like actually accomplish that. And then definitely the dining Hall for dinner, because then i'll eat more than I would cooking on my own. And more variety to and then most likely proper probably pop it in cereal but."
79.0,Provider,"OK cool well, I wonder if we should create a grocery list, then."
18370.0,Patient,that's a good idea.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, but do you want to share screen I don't know if you want to create it on $1. Short or. We do need. to review your nutritionist."
18370.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay, can you see my screen."
79.0,Provider,yeah cute.
18370.0,Patient,"Sorry, you see, like a Greek yogurt so probably at that."
79.0,Provider,Some people spell.
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, really. eggs are always. always a Turkey and always. Protein powder I like to have protein."
79.0,Provider,powder and my yogurt.
18370.0,Patient,I don't know is that okay.
79.0,Provider,yeah that's fine.
18370.0,Patient,"With yogurt. i've been really liking like protein serials because I think those make me feel less ag than like just straight sugar so maybe. like that, and I feel like they have more substance to them to."
79.0,Provider,Our. And do you like that's one of the one of the most important questions do you actually like eating it.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah no I really like that I found flavors that I like like there's some like just tastes on cardboard, but then there's some that are like."
79.0,Provider,Actually I. amen to that.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah no the summer really good and they have like the ones that are better have less protein, but it feels like it's something it's something that I like. Yes, now. So anything that you can think of that would be good."
79.0,Provider,"or what's your milk, what do you put in your protein cereal."
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, I usually eat pretty terrible drive, but I have been drinking milk every day to like help with the bone stuff. i've been liking, the fair life milk."
79.0,Provider,Excellent yeah.
18370.0,Patient,Is that good okay.
79.0,Provider,that's great one.
18370.0,Patient,"Okay, and then what."
79.0,Provider,You said you do definitely do dinner So what do you do for these lunches.
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, usually wraps so definitely need wraps. Okay, and I usually put like Turkey, and a lettuce and ranch dressing or Mayo, but I think we have mail with lots of it."
79.0,Provider,And it's still good yeah.
18370.0,Patient,What. Turkey oh yeah I have that.
79.0,Provider,"up here, but maybe sorry i'm glad."
18370.0,Patient,"Okay, no you're right I probably should get to because I do go through it very quickly."

18370.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i'll just put like noodles. Oh, and frozen meals, I like sometimes just really quick. I don't think we have yeah I. Think that's pretty much everything I usually would. Like beef jerky as a snack so i'll just put that."
79.0,Provider,"On and you might put in a line of the challenge food like if there's a challenge food that. you're doing, who knows you know what."
18370.0,Patient,yeah.

18370.0,Patient,"I didn't because that. But i've always wanted yeah. Have state yeah well the creamery at penn state is so it's the creamer cream ice cream. creaminess ice cream i've ever had it's so good, and like it's in our dining plan so that is awesome. yeah so it's so nice, but the problem is they tried to like sell it at grocery stores. But they're not allowed, because the fat content is too high it's like. Man it's illegal to have early I don't know not like FDA approved to have that high fat content. So at the grey yes, you have to get it there."
79.0,Provider,i'm gonna have to look that up no idea.
18370.0,Patient,I know I like it could be some crazy man. But that's that's what it says.
79.0,Provider,yeah i'll have to look into it that's.
18370.0,Patient,What it tastes good.
79.0,Provider,"Oh yeah exactly and let's be real like and I told my friend, is going to teach on this tonight, but i'm like maybe teaching about the essential need for fat in our diet is a real."
18370.0,Patient,yeah my outpatient data Center would always tell me about that she'd be laughing all the time you just have more fat.
79.0,Provider,yeah. fatty acid deficiency is real yeah okay.
18370.0,Patient,that's what I think that's a great start and you.
79.0,Provider,can always you know make more plans okay.
18370.0,Patient,um let's see your initial.
79.0,Provider,"assignment and then then we're out of time that was fast, though."
18370.0,Patient,"Oh no we i'm sorry, what was the nutrition assignment."
79.0,Provider,"you're on week two, so I have to look it up."
18370.0,Patient,Oh nutrition goals right.
79.0,Provider,yeah that sounds right.
18370.0,Patient,"I didn't write them down, but is it Okay, if I just like say."
79.0,Provider,"let's just do it here just write them down right now, as we go."
18370.0,Patient,Okay perfect okay. My desktop is such a mess i'm sorry.
79.0,Provider,worries.
18370.0,Patient,So definitely moving away should I should I do like long term and short term.
79.0,Provider,yeah I think that's awesome it's a great idea. you're stepping stone towards your long term. be so great.
18370.0,Patient,So. For short term. Putting. popcorn cereal or like putting nighttime snacks in bowls.
79.0,Provider,mm hmm cool.
18370.0,Patient,"cuz that's always such a challenge for me because I don't want to like know how much i'm eating. i'm afraid i'll start like tracking it. But I think it's it's a good step and then change just changing up for. You nighttime routine so like new place new show. Because even just like switching the types of. cereals and having sometimes like. enough to feel like different. Working on daytime eating. cheese. I think like working on like. All foods, at all times. Because i've been proud to be like I love desert, but I love desert at night I don't like those are before X time. And then long term, just like moving away from nighttime eating altogether. More. freedom. or flexibility. kids. little to no inside. yeah especially. If I could not be that good."
79.0,Provider,I would be amazing. And that means you're going to. be a serious rebel about society. just saying you have to cope. rebellious voice.
18370.0,Patient,"Oh no i'm very, very focused on what everyone Laurel think seven so I have to like work on."
79.0,Provider,yeah. For sure.
18370.0,Patient,that's true that's true yeah.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and now how. How are you gonna have we have to change in your schedule in order to accomplish some of these things."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah like making it a habit to like eat during the day and eat in the balls and just working all these things, making all these things like normal and have it. yeah and really starting to like. met like. what's the word put things together, like put things already doing with new things that I want to try to make it more like easier to make a habit. yeah."
79.0,Provider,Do you need to change your bedtime routine or time or sleeping schedule anything.
18370.0,Patient,"That yeah. That would be helpful to go to bed earlier wake up earlier yeah. hope that. I found something out that's not going to help that though the class that I have that's at 9:30am is an asynchronous hybrid class, so it means that I can dig it when it happens, or you can just watch the video whatever I. want so i'm like ooh I should try and take it where it's."
79.0,Provider,You said totally.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah yeah get a really, really try and work on."
79.0,Provider,be specific on changing your sleeping schedule what what does that mean.
18370.0,Patient,Okay i'm going to bed. Before before that's a reasonable.
79.0,Provider,goal.
18370.0,Patient,And wiki.
