2699.0,Patient,I don't think I have the right.
214.0,Provider,"So hold on let's let's let's work on that together, because that's, the only thing that keeps that light up like a Christmas tree right after that. So see. Right, this is not. Good. So you see that link. In the chat."

2699.0,Patient,"How, and that will be a weekly one."
214.0,Provider,"Is a monthly survey. Right so perfect perfect perfect. This was something I didn't like. So let's. See, so I think this is really fascinating to watch in such a short time, but being able to pay attention to everything. You can see what it says here right making progress, consider lowering care intensity. So look at look at one needle to needle now as soon as you do, the pain survey."
2699.0,Patient,You go back to the green.
214.0,Provider,yeah so you're rocking it man.
2699.0,Patient,cool. yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So I think what we should do is it just the individual now. And then, when we meet adjust the weekly so go down to one and two, so in December you'll only on November, you only have to see me once come to group for four weeks in December I dropped the group to to see we're only seeing it three times a month."
2699.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,make sense. yeah alright cool.
2699.0,Patient,"yeah gruesome going pretty good now, I think. You can tell who's. interacting interactive and who's not you know."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. So what we know about people is if we get a crowd and nobody's yelling and nobody screaming the least causing problems everybody's the same. You get that first guy that light to torch and then you see everybody come up, but when you ask people independently to stand up, they can't do it. yeah you know i'm saying so, why everybody lives, we had a lot to say this week it was a little more deflated there was one proponent out there. So other people didn't couldn't piggyback off anybody else you know saying. yeah it kind of it kind of just you know deflated by itself, and I knew that was going to have it that's okay. So I definitely want to do this for you, because I think this is the right thing for you i'm so glad and i'm telling you they send you this chart, and this is all lit up you're going to be in the Green, you may be the first person to hit that milestone. Because we pay, I pay attention to how to work with the chart just say know what to do with it, so this is good medications working out good."
2699.0,Patient,yeah perfect.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, this wasn't. As bad, but let me just make sure. All right, here we go so let's go back to this. Right okay perfect time to do that now. And there will be like this. stable. weekly. group we're transferring slices. And then on the bottom your screen. Because you need to know this, too. Because they'll tell you guys something like nobody's paying attention."
2699.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"i'm just going to show you one and i'll put the note which is at the bottom. Because a lot of them like what no of you talking about like no I seen them put a note and I put a note, right here and I originally put a note to say that your charts all screwed up, and this is the only thing he needs to do. So now we're going to add this no. that's going to say you know you stable your engage you have positive support you know you're taking your medication or signs of relapse no indications of any cravings urges. So they go to just been. so beautiful so now we're going to pray. So, you know that the notes there. So at the bottom, so please somebody says we don't see none, you can actually drive them towards that. Is all the way to.
