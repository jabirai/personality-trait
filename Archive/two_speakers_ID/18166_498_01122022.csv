That had was diagnosed dementia and so i'm. trying not only trying to juggle myself but i'm trying to juggle all them and all their appointments and i've had issues in the past with this and, like I just thought it was time to seek help for this again, you know, I was off medication for a while, because I tried to utilize. The things that were taught to me, you know because I was on medication i'm like I need to take a break from this, and so I started again using like mindfulness and cvt and try to like you know do. write things down for appointments and things like that, but then I end up having like three different notebooks. I miss their appointments or last minute trying to get medications for them and then that's where my like low self esteem comes in, and like you know I feel your um.

18166.0,Patient,"yeah I do it will it first started when I was a kid um, and so my parents didn't understand what was going on, and of course I didn't understand what was going on. I was filling my classes, I couldn't focus in class people would comment to my parents like are you just giving her Kool aid, you know because she's all jacked up you know what's wrong with her. But that was like in the 70s and nobody really knew what was going on, I ended up dropping out of school because of lack of just like I feel like I have. Most people have an antenna on their head and like i've got a satellite like there's so much coming in at me all the time and, just like, but then. When after I had my second child i'm like this, like I need to figure out what's wrong with me, you know, and at that time my mom, so I will you know, maybe I think you might have at. A TV and you should look into it, because I was getting panic attacks, because I couldn't like focus on anything, because now, I have my second child and it was interrupting my life. to a point where it was it was hard for my marriage and the kids and for myself, and so I went to go see a doctor in 2003. When she diagnosed me with. With add and that's what I first started taking medication. And I got his information here to if you need it. Look that up."

498.0,Provider,Any different medications.
18166.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
498.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just wondering previously lots of people have been on. At things like out all things like Ritalin now there's a wider spectrum of medications that may provide you some benefits for to. wellbutrin things that are stimulating like they have a stimulant of effect, you still have to be mindful that they can cause some insomnia, some headaches and GI upset because they work like stimulants but they're not stimulants themselves. Okay, so that may be a consideration for you. Okay um. Any. Any other notable medic medical history any hypertension and diabetes, cancer kidney disease liberties any cardiac disease renal issues respiratory anything that you can think up either with regard to yourself, your mother or your father side of the family."
18166.0,Patient,"And my mom ended up having. She was always kind of sick she ended up getting type two diabetes, she had rheumatoid arthritis and then she ended up having Ms and then ultimately died in us."

498.0,Provider,legal history and you.

498.0,Provider,That point anxiety.
18166.0,Patient,"yeah it's for it, I used it mostly like. Because of the events that have happened. And then I also had some night tears, and so they gave me promotion, but it doesn't it doesn't really help like. I think the only medication that really kind of helped was it galloping."
498.0,Provider,i'm still taking a position daily.
18166.0,Patient,Prison now not.
498.0,Provider,"So what you're taking them regularly, now is the gabapentin in the panel oh. yeah okay anything else."
18166.0,Patient,No. Oh yeah yeah I take. The locks the team.
498.0,Provider,How long have you been on the team.
18166.0,Patient,for about two years.
498.0,Provider,"Indeed, like it's providing you with some overall relief, with regard to mood and anxiety."
18166.0,Patient,yeah okay.
498.0,Provider,"And I do think that, because you have. Because you are treating anxiety strategically will be an even more appropriate medication for you understand that you have some historical successes with propranolol i'm sorry not propranolol but at all, however adderall can exacerbate anxiety because it is a stimulant. So that's just something to keep in mind. With regard to. The combination of the deluxe the team never been the panel all are you tolerating it Okay, do you feel like are you experiencing any dizziness any. modification in blood pressure, because the combination of those two can. cause some some reduction in blood pressure. yeah okay good good. Okay, and um because you're on the Luxor team deluxe a team and for Tierra."
18166.0,Patient,what's just Tara.
498.0,Provider,Tara is the medication for the ADHD that I was referencing.
18166.0,Patient,Earlier gotcha.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, I apologize for that. Just so you're aware, with regard to the stretch here. it's like I said the medication that can be used for improvement for attention focus and concentration it's designed as an antidepressant but its target. and its target is both mood attention specifically focus concentration in order to sustain mental effort. And it can cause some headache again because, though it is, by definition, and under President can cause some. headache. Okay, it can cause some. Increase in heart rate and therefore increase in blood pressure. So any difficulty with sleeping. A deal because it is stimulants like it can also cause some anxiety, so I would like to start you off at a very, very introductory dose. Of about 40 milligrams and stay there for anywhere from two to four weeks, depending on how you proliferative. Then takes about takes about four to six weeks in order to receive a gradual response, because even though stimulative like it doesn't have that hard hitting stimulant effect where you can take it one day you fill it the next. Time. It takes them a gradual it's in graduation and in regards to the overall therapeutic benefit, which is good because it wouldn't want anything to strong in order to exacerbate some symptom all of the symptom ology that you're already suffering with. But it basically boost your norepinephrine and your orange adrenaline and your dope mean in the in the proposal cortex and so its overall beneficial to people who have ADHD and anxiety because stimulants can, making it worse."
18166.0,Patient,"yeah I noticed on because when I got diagnosed with ADHD or a dd. I was diagnosed with like depression, anxiety. And, in combination. But, for some reason, it seemed to me like the stimulant like calms me down. Like it almost like made me sedated. So it kind of took away the. Things it with this medication do the same thing for me, or are you saying it's going to make me more anxious."
498.0,Provider,"And then I know. With because it is has like a stimulant effect, the reason i'm i'm warning you about. Some some exacerbation in a in anxiety is the same reason, I would warn you about it with regard to the outer wall."
18166.0,Patient,Okay okay perfect.
498.0,Provider,"exact same like comparable scenario, but in most cases, it does not exacerbate anxiety. Okay, most of the anxiety an exacerbation is the are those who are. suffering from generalized anxiety, independent of move who wake up dangerous not those who are ages as. A side effect of another symptom, whether it be attention focus concentration or."
18166.0,Patient,"dislike right because I find that attention causes like a vintage it causes me anxiety because i'm like. Trying to like. You know figure out like where like I I visited appointment, or like what's going on, you know so that's what causes my anxiety to in my self esteem like I can't do this, you know."
