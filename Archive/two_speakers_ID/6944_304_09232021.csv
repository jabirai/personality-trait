Like i'm would only thing that's going to happen before the holidays i'm. yeah it was it wasn't cold blood related he was on his way home and had a heart attack and he had a pacemaker in his wife was with him, and it was maybe 10 minutes I think before the paramedics got there so. They coated them within the day they and he had no brain activity and he hung on I guess either the family did for another three or four days and then he finally passed away. want to say it was Monday night or Tuesday early Tuesday morning. So they have the what they have, or maybe it was Sunday night early Monday morning because they had the they have the memorial right now, or the week and then the funeral small morning so. it's an park for us, which is pretty far from here, but we're gonna harper and I and Devon are going to go. seven will leave here about 7am and we should be there in time."
304.0,Provider,wow How far is it.
6944.0,Patient,"A GPS says it's an hour and 40 minutes but that's. Think when my mom sent it to me it was in the middle of the afternoon, so it I don't think that is counting rush hour traffic to Chicago. It sure, except by Chicago."

6944.0,Patient,No.
304.0,Provider,No she's she's holding out.
6944.0,Patient,"yeah. I guess if you're that if you're I think she's 77 if you're that old and that's what and that's how she feels I don't know I don't know what drives her decision, but I know that. My step dad's not vaccinated either and his sister died in the beginning, like last March, and they said was coven related yeah so um I know all his brothers and sisters are vaccinated and I think that he probably would be to it wasn't my mom behind it, but I don't I don't know for sure."
304.0,Provider,Like a wedge among your family.
6944.0,Patient,"on his side, I think I don't know i'll see what the tension is. tomorrow."
304.0,Provider,Tomorrow yeah well and that's kind of scary to you know you have an indoor events where people are not you know.
6944.0,Patient,yeah and she won't wear a mask either because she's. it's hard for her to breathe with the masks she's got COPD but I. I guess I. Oh yeah.
304.0,Provider,"Right like. And I could breathe with a mask on like well it's harder to read this here on a ventilator but. All right, yeah. Oh yeah okay."
6944.0,Patient,I just don't. See that's why i'm vaccinated because. it's just such.
304.0,Provider,"An issue of contention know and it shouldn't, be it shouldn't be but okay so but you've you've been well harper's with you full time now."
6944.0,Patient,"Is not full time she still sees her mom she's Scott. said five out of 14 days, three days one week to the next."
304.0,Provider,With her mom.
6944.0,Patient,"yeah and that it might change, I mean if she does some things that she needs to do then. You know I even let harper goal like if her mom wants to pick her up and take her have her for dinner, and like i've done that plenty of times just. If harper acid wants to see your mom she goes to her mom signed her up for cheerleading which was it six hours a week. 332 hour days and. One of them is on mom's day and she doesn't show up and a lot of times, she doesn't take harper. So. I think that harbor just wants her mom to be part of something and. can't make her do it so."
304.0,Provider,"I mean, there was a lot of issues with her mom right like there was Big Brother and lots of things we're comfortable with and. OK. But, so this is better now than it."
6944.0,Patient,Is this more stable more calm.
304.0,Provider,"yeah and she's not going back and forth so much. More time. With you when or if, like a visiting scheduled with mom. yeah okay. So that sort of comes down all that stuff with the CFS has calmed down."
6944.0,Patient,Yes. I did Scott home get pizza 11 and i'm waiting. somebody's supposed to stop by and.
304.0,Provider,pick up a problem.
6944.0,Patient,"Speakers from Facebook marketplace. So we've been doing the farmers market. Here in the Calvin it's gone pretty good, we had a it's called the back alley market. Last weekend, it was about 100 vendors and we did really well at that day. So that was nice."
304.0,Provider,"yeah it's such a beautiful time of year now for fall and. Other other fall. festivals and farmers markets. So. i'm i'm almost homework and I but um so last time you and I talked to you, you were pretty upset and feeling like suboxone was sort of I don't know impeding you are reflecting negatively on you, how are you feeling about that now."
6944.0,Patient,i'm.
304.0,Provider,gonna let you to feel like you want us to come back.
6944.0,Patient,"Because I know that I don't function right without it, I mean I, I know that I don't I feel. I just don't process things properly when. it's, not that I even think about using it's just that my mind. feels like i'm in a fog and I feel. tired and. depressed but I was in a situation where it was being used against me and with the driver's license thing they wanted to they want to. I felt like it was a I don't know I felt like that it was a violation of my hipaa rights for them to be able to say. You can drive. If we. If you show that you're going to meetings, and you have to have all these letters and you have to have all this stuff and all these hurdles they had to jump through and so it's just easier for me to say I I don't take suboxone anymore, and I don't. Have substance meetings, Mrs just easier for me to go that way."
304.0,Provider,"Right, so what happened with your driver's license."
6944.0,Patient,"I it's still in the process, because there has to be a. Like a 90 day period of time in there, where you're not. Where you're. Saying that you're not on any medications they're equating the medication to the same as if I was the substance user. They basically say. That if you're on suboxone you. can't operate a vehicle and I think that's insanity. I don't think that that's fair at all, because I don't think suboxone. And they don't know this, I you know."
304.0,Provider,"I don't want to be your your adversary, or you know. If the dmv or you know, whoever you were dealing with at that time probation like if they were against you, using suboxone that's. Not you know I don't want to have a conflictual or adversarial relationship with you that's not. yeah what i'm what i'm here to do so. just wanted to kind of clear the air on that."
6944.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I feel like there's a lots of people that take suboxone and if every person that took the first issue was is the dui I had was for marijuana and it was 10 years ago it was in 2011 so. For them to say that. That I even that that should even hinder me getting my license reinstated. It first the first couple years of after 2001 I jumped through their hurdles. And I went I did their evaluation to do page county. I was hostile towards them because I felt that a. lot of its way, I feel, because I thought it was a conflict of interest that G page county probation department. be in charge of the evaluation I think that's that's the only county and Illinois that does their own evaluations and, if you look at the percentages of people that go in there for. For their evaluations they're coming out of there with a level three assessment, which is 75 hour class hours and I had already been assessed and had was assessed at 10 hours and did the 10 hour class time got my certificate yet went to get my driver's license and. I was honest on the paperwork and I put that. I put that I attended meetings and may team meetings, and so the evaluator said, who wants to MIT meeting and I said some medication assisted treatment. I take suboxone and to get the medication, the state requires that you attend the sessions and, at the time I was at bright heart health or not right heart come on. Come on girl. Is my puppy they hi. hi at the time I was at. Work on Dr Steve is that lighthouse."
304.0,Provider,Right right.
6944.0,Patient,"And so. We had we had to attend meetings, I believe it was once a week. It went down the longer you were there, but, and so the evaluator said, he said that I, the statements made in my assessment didn't match the statements that I made in my. In my reinstatement interview, and he made it sound to me like I was. He made it like I was misleading or dishonest and I wasn't I was being truthful they just didn't know what a medication assisted treatment. Group was and so he made the determination and sent it to Springfield saying that he thought I was misclassified. And that I want to do another evaluation, when I wanted to do the evaluation, they said because I still tend substance abuse treatment groups that I needed to do 75 hours of class time and when you calculate it all up it comes out to about 30 $500 and I said. i'm not doing that, and so they said well we'll just tell the judge you don't want to cooperate and I said. Do what you want to do, because I i'm I already did the jail time so there's nothing they can do other than deny my license reinstatement and so that's what they did. And so to go to have to appeal to Springfield and go through all the hurdles is is the practice I started and then finally went to the original assessor who said. Who said that. He would sign off on it being completed for the 10 hours. But he wanted me to pay him an extra $250. And I said that I felt that it was their misunderstand like it was I don't know if it was a miscommunication or their misunderstanding because i'm I can't remember the name of the place now it's in aurora someplace you wrote a letter to, I think. He said that. That I had to pay for the for the evaluation, because it has to be within 180 days. And so I went ahead and just paid it because it was it's otherwise it's a whole court process so i'm just waiting to hear back from Springfield for the reinstatement which they should. grant because I haven't had a ticket that this is actually the ticket that I that suspended my license is the only ticket i've ever had. never even had a movement."
304.0,Provider,I mean I am I from what everyone has told me Illinois is just so hardcore with driver's licenses.
6944.0,Patient,yeah they.
304.0,Provider,were pretty rough.
6944.0,Patient,"But some people, I mean I know people I know people that have three duis and are still driving harper's mom has to do is in the last year, but it's a year and a half now and she's still driving her vehicle so. I mean I just think it's hypocritical. Especially. Now."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, as far as what you're going through, I guess, I hope that you understand that, like. You know your information, with right heart health is confidential you, you asked me to write a letter for you, I wrote it to you that, like right her health and your therapy here like is a separate entity from. The CFS from to page county probation from the dmv. Like I. just want to just put that out there."
6944.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,and make that clear.
6944.0,Patient,"And there's been times, where, and there are still times that I drive, because I have to and I don't with harper but because I won't risk getting stopped with her in the vehicle and me being. What happens if you get stopped driving on your vote is you're going to jail for one to they're going to tell your vehicle and if I had harper with me child services would be involved, and they would take her and that and that's just not it's not worth it to me so. locally, if I have to go to the store, something I I have driven. myself. Things that I have to do for work, sometimes hey girl you're gonna hurt your teeth. Sometimes I. I make decisions that I have to make, but for the most part. i've been here to their suspension I didn't get from 2001 and or 2011 until 2017 I had my license that whole time because I had just played their game. It was only till 2017 when they wanted the reevaluation and I said i'm not doing that that's when they revoked my license so and I feel like from 2011 to 2017. And every everything before 2011 I had never even had a moving violation so for them to classify me as a level three and want to have me. mandated to go into substance abuse classes for marijuana I thought was fine a financial thing. And so I that's That was the comment that got me in trouble was I was before the judge and he said so you're telling me that the Illinois state. Because my test came back for trade, I told the judge I wasn't high that day I wasn't I had smoked maybe three days previous I was tired I work two jobs. I tried explaining it to the judge the conflict was their test it's, the first question said I smoke marijuana 123 times a day two to five times a day. More than five times. A day and I said i'm not filling this out i'm not saying that I smoked marijuana and he said, but you have a dui for marijuana and I said I don't smoke 3123 times a day and i'm not going to put that on a piece of paper for the state i'm not doing it. mm hmm so at that point, the evaluator was like well. i'll tell the judge that you're not being cooperative and I said, do what you gotta do and we went back in before the judge and he said. what's the problem, and I said first off the problem is, is that. This the State police lab work right here says trace amounts of thc. And this law in 2011 there was no there was no legal level like micrograms or whatever per leader, now they have a set. Fast forward seven years or eight years, whatever they have a set. To be considered intoxicated for marijuana you have to have 350 or whatever it is Mike grams per liter of blood and my tasks was less than 50. And so I told him I didn't even get the requirements for a dui. I had a public defender and the officer who stopped me that day had pre-determined when he saw that I had been in dlc two years previous because I was brought in 2009 he had already decided, I was going to jail that day. Because he did the test and then this statement I passed every field sobriety tests and he had me drive from the location, we were at seven and a half miles to central page hospital to. He had me drive seven half miles to Center of the page hospital. To take a urine and blood test which I did voluntarily which my lawyer told me you're stupid, but I had no fear of being intoxicated that day because I wasn't I was tired."
304.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6944.0,Patient,"And I knew I was tired and not intoxicated so when it two days later, when they showed up at my house arrest me. For the dui because he gave me a signature bond which he said he would do if I voluntarily took the test and I didn't have the money for them 10 pound my car. So I took I I told the judge, I said, if I was so intoxicated and why would this officer had have me drive seven and a half miles."
304.0,Provider,"right that makes sense, I mean it doesn't make sense yeah."
6944.0,Patient,"He told me I said so the kind of thing that got me put in jail that day was he said something about. That State police lab and I said, I find it hard to believe that any test goes down to the State police lab that doesn't come back positive and. And he said something else and and I just told him that I thought it was financial did it was for financial gain and that I thought it was a conflict of interest that. That the probation department, does the evaluation, to begin with. And so, he jailed me and so at that point, I did 180 days in jail and and it was in 2012 and so legally there was nothing else they could do the Court could do to me, I was done, I serve the time the case was done, it was the Secretary of State that came back and said. Even though you did the jail time you met the requirements for the legal portion but you don't meet the requirements to be reinstated through the Secretary of State, and so. that's when I got the the revoked domain, they revoked my license. And it was seven years, almost seven years to the day after the actual incident. So yeah my mouth probably got me in more trouble than anything. Yes, no, no girl."
304.0,Provider,yeah. that's yeah.
6944.0,Patient,"Not even a minute, whereas."
304.0,Provider,yeah you know that so yeah I know that my mouth is nice.
6944.0,Patient,Like biggest problem.
304.0,Provider,"Okay, and just. respond."
6944.0,Patient,worked on responding versus.
304.0,Provider,"Reacting you react, and that gets you in."
6944.0,Patient,trouble.
304.0,Provider,My my.
6944.0,Patient,"Work on start thinking about bonding. And that's probably what's drawn this whole thing out to with with harper was because child services would come. I filed a report I use my name. Oh no i'm in a zoom meeting be sure no problem. Have a good day. So. I I feel like a to call and make a DC fs report and you put your name on it. It has a lot more credibility than. somebody who calls makes anonymous report. Because I feel like if you have to hide your name when you're making a report then there's probably something. Some miss truth and something that you're reporting, because otherwise, why would you hide your name and like."
304.0,Provider,"there's a lot of reasons. there's other reasons, I think, but go ahead."
6944.0,Patient,"But this was specifically. Liz was calling and making these reports because. She was being indicated in court and being monitored, on her drug use. And so, she would have herself or her friends calling make these reports and for an officer to show up at my house at one o'clock in the morning and get my daughter out of bed. Had me bring her down and take your clothes off so they can see if she has any bruises on her body at 1am in the morning. The first time I allowed it the second time, which was not even two weeks later, I close the door on the outer space, I told him sorry. And I can interact if somebody is that concerned about her welfare, then why wouldn't they call it a reasonable hour of the day. Why would somebody make a policeman wellness check at one o'clock in the morning we're sleeping. When you."
304.0,Provider,answer the door yeah.
6944.0,Patient,"Well, so, while they were signing flashlights and all the windows."
304.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
6944.0,Patient,"My roommate woke up stuff because. Sorry, because there's a belief that in flashlights in the House. straw, the first time we cooperated the second time. We said no."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
6944.0,Patient,"we're not doing. This detrimental to a child to do that. As the order protection against her. If the time. So the officer, the second time. I let him come in. Eventually, because I knew it was going to escalate up I didn't. Let him come in and I said listen, this is what's going on, I put your protection on the counter. I said, we have a protection order against the mother. For harassment. This is harassment, and so this officer actually did he went he tried to prove that it was her. But he said, in the end, that it was in it was. One of her friends, most likely had called. He threw it out, because he thought that the person who made their port and they didn't disclose it to me who it was, but that exactly if they were that concerned about her well being Why would they. They weren't a family member they weren't a friend of mine, or a teacher or in any type of mandated reporter, why would they wait until 1230 in the morning to call make a report."
304.0,Provider,Right yeah fair point.
6944.0,Patient,"So. But it's the process of. Constantly going through that. It starts to really wear you down after a while and. We don't. I don't know. I know that I probably said, a common to to to my mother or to my roommate. That harper may have overheard but I don't allow and I would never sit with my seven year old daughter, and say anything negative about her mom. In fact it's the opposite, I feel like I lied to her face when she asked me why isn't mom here at cheer I just want mom to come and I tell her harper. mom must be working I know mom loves you I hope she misses you wherever she's at and she'll get here when she can but let's just make the best, and I feel like i'm lying right to her face so and. I never allow anybody in my family to say anything. negative or even derogatory about her mom because I remember those situations when I was a kid and I know. For a fact that, for me, I resented my dad. For the thing I would say about my mother. And I would never give that. Power I guess you could say. To her mom for her absenteeism as a parent I would never give her something that she could turn around and say your dad did this or your dad did that, because. Never one time accepting this last petition have I ever asked the Court to limit her parenting, I just wanted them to recognize that she was not the victim that we were being victimized and our rights were being victimized and that we wanted to. rectify the situation and stop the harassment. I even to this day, promote that she spends time with her mother. Because that's what she wants. To get it. Okay. Sorry, I got a little. distracted. So. I my biggest thing I think I need to work on is. organization."
304.0,Provider,that's been a theme for a while mark organization of what. I know let's be specific yeah specific.
6944.0,Patient,"My family knows if I say i'm going to be there at five i'm there six. um. But at the same time, I feel like they all. They give me such a hard time about everything being about harper."
304.0,Provider,that's been an. Ongoing I was about seven.
6944.0,Patient,You guys are wanting for 21 and 20 Those are my older kids.
304.0,Provider,You guys are ongoing issue yep that's been an ongoing issue with them.
6944.0,Patient,"I did her book fair on Tuesday. I was at the school from. 830 to. noon ish. and I went on, I was checking her assignments, yesterday I know. You have a portal called skyward and I can go on there and talk to any other teachers or even the principal. see her daily assignments see if she missed school at when she was with her mom like it shows you everything attendance fundraise any events, and so I noticed that. She was mark tardy on Tuesday well month Okay, so this started on Friday Liz was supposed to have harper."
304.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6944.0,Patient,"or it's a night she messaged me and said. She thought that the her boys had coven. She was taking them to get tested there it started Thursday because she was supposed to be a cheerleader. She asked me if I could keep harper i'm used to that, so I absolutely hammered keeper. So the next day Friday. She still hasn't gotten the results back and she wants to come pick harper up for her parenting time and I I can't stop her from doing it, so I sat I just said, do you think that's a good idea why can't you just wait another few hours, so they told her 48 hours for the test results. mm hmm why can't you just wait another 48 hours. She went to the school and picked her up anyway Sunday morning at 5am when she dropped her off here that part's still crazy that the Court would allow her to be dropped off at 5am but it's a Sunday anyway, she. dropped her off here, and as soon as harper came and how she said she had a sore throat and headache and she heard she was all congested so I took her. That morning to be tested beta two tests instance swab and. A test they send out. They told me the same thing 48 hours. So Monday. More the instant test came back negative right away, I sent it to them school nurse and said listen she's congested she doesn't have a fever, she wants to come to school because she doesn't want to miss cheerleading. And she doesn't want to miss the Book Fair."
304.0,Provider,And she can't without a negative test.
6944.0,Patient,"Right, so I provided them the instant negative tests and the nurse said that was sufficient. They let her come by the end of the day, Monday, when she came home she really felt horrible."
304.0,Provider,She still she's still fit.
6944.0,Patient,"she's still at the cheerleading. They never wear masks the whole time which they're outside. She has a competition, this weekend, so they told the girls that they miss a miss in a meeting they can't be in the competition. So she I always asked her what do you want to do, she wanted to go so Tuesday morning we had the Book Fair and I knew she had gotten worse over the night, one day, probably because she was at cheer and it was like the first night that was kind of drizzly. And it was I would say that it was nasty out, it was probably 68 degrees, it was nasty. She so Tuesday morning I I shop at the school at. 845 that's when the bell rings, Mrs coil the library and told me I couldn't get in there until the buses had left at 850 I had to send them all my vaccination stuff to show them vaccinated even get in the school."
304.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6944.0,Patient,"So we come in the office at 850 and I said harper really wants to do the Book Fair, especially because her dad's here I don't think it's a good idea that she stays here today she's visibly sick coughing congested. She doesn't have Kobe we have the negative test, but she could have a cold or flu."
304.0,Provider,it's more than happy exactly yeah.
6944.0,Patient,"For her to stay they took her to the nurse and the nurse asked her if she wanted to stay and she said she did, and they let her stay, I thought it was reading."
304.0,Provider,"wow i'm surprised, they said hey."
6944.0,Patient,"I hadn't posted on the Facebook school page before we head even left to school, what should I do and every single parent that responded said, keep your child home it's your response."
304.0,Provider,"So why did you why did you let her go, then you could have made the decision to say i'm your dad harper you're sick you could still give other kids you're cold."
6944.0,Patient,"I did, and when I called the school date set to bring her in and let the nurse checker so I did what they said to do. Well, what am I supposed to go against the school, I mean if I did, that then they're going to say that i've kept their home from school when she should be in school, I mean there's a."
304.0,Provider,way that makes say she said she doesn't feel well she's coughing and sneezing and.
6944.0,Patient,"Have a fever of 100 points for. that she needed to be there and I, and I, they said it's this allergy season and it's most likely allergies and I said allergies so income with. It doesn't matter."
304.0,Provider,"How much. Are you arguing with yourself after the fact, when Thank you feel bad like you feel like you made the wrong decision."
6944.0,Patient,"In your gut I know I wasn't minds, I feel like the decisions, not mine. And then, when I go on the skyward and check they marked her is tardy. For the school in the morning because she was in the nurse's office and I said. Wait a second I wasn't even gonna bring her to school."
304.0,Provider,Where I.
6944.0,Patient,You guys told me to bring her in and let the nurses.
304.0,Provider,Like there's a are you feeling. Are you feeling like there's a consequence to her being tardy that you're going to face some repercussion.
6944.0,Patient,"No, I just think that it's ridiculous they marketers tardy."
304.0,Provider,"I see okay all right mark, well, we got to wrap this up today okay. let's let's schedule to meet again in a few weeks okay. i'm pretty booked. The first couple weeks of October, but. I have October 28 or October October 28 in the afternoon or October 29 in the morning. I could do 330 again on the."
