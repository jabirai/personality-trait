14443.0,Patient,"looks a little stressful but I gotta get it done so, we want to do it today. or this week. yeah. She got married on today, or I guess. Yesterday, because the timezone she offered in."
214.0,Provider,Okay. So how's your relationship with your boyfriend.
14443.0,Patient,Oh i'm. Better.
214.0,Provider,Did you have that discussion or no.
14443.0,Patient,"We did we did talk. And it was good, I think we're on the same terms."
214.0,Provider,"When you say you on the same terms was, I mean."
14443.0,Patient,i'm he understands why I was upset um. And he's okay with. Like. I guess like he's not offended or like. angry like understands how I feel I respect slot so. All I could ask for.
214.0,Provider,So do you feel better do you feel comfortable is this.
14443.0,Patient,"yeah can we get past it, or will we add. I think, so I mean I haven't thought about it a little bit, so I think things are better um. Whereas a couple weeks ago I feel like I would have a problem with something like every day. I mean i've also had like a lot of things about with. Like breathing and stuff for a couple days so i've been more preoccupied with that."
214.0,Provider,"Do you feel, but you seem more grounded. Today, then, you were two weeks ago, when you went to his phone you seem it more P show you more peace."
14443.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't. Like what is what is he also expressed how that made him feel and that plant more perspective. He was like I just want to let you know how I feel about you doing this like i'll let you do it because I have nothing to hide, and if that makes you feel more like you can trust me more than i'll let you do it, but I just want you to know that. It does not make me feel good when you do this and then now i'm just keeping my mind."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, do you think, do you think. That his explanation or communication. Like brought peace to you."
14443.0,Patient,i'm. glad he's telling me when he's a triple m. yeah yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So what what's next for you, then in this exploration with this relationship where are you where are we traveling next with it, what are we going to do with it."
14443.0,Patient,i'm. I don't I don't really know.
214.0,Provider,"I, are you going to take it as a columns."
14443.0,Patient,that's. Probably what's going to happen. focus on. academics right now. Because I feel like I spent so much time on all this and it's been affecting. Other parts of my life when. I could just not worry about what's.
214.0,Provider,"right for you, right to the idea now is finding a balance in the entire wheel. Instead of just one segment right, because then, what will feel like it's like. Oh, this guy away from me, I didn't pay attention to this and now we're like I put too much focus on one thing and look at all these other things now i'm really stressed out."
14443.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,You feel that way I know.
14443.0,Patient,i'm. I don't blame it on anything. But. I do think that. I need to put more time and effort.
214.0,Provider,To academics you mean.
14443.0,Patient,yeah the mix myself. Even like. To do my laundry and cleaning my room.
214.0,Provider,The basics I agree so how's your mood been lately.
14443.0,Patient,"Okay, today, I mean. i'm not like acting out. or being irrational I. haven't been super happier posers but. I don't think i've been bad."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, no, no, no thoughts of harming yourself or figuring how you don't feel like waking up or anything like that."
14443.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good good and and understand you just had this well, you had two events that we had one we had a loss of a grandmother. And then we had you know what could have been a little trepidation about your boyfriend having the conversation. So you know, for the last two weeks there's probably a lot laying on there and then taking time off from school and then figuring out now what's involved to catch up with that you know there's a lot, so we have to say to ourselves. Okay, so you know, this is what we shouldn't do we shouldn't get behind on any one thing, but in the interim, I made it through it and I made it through it pretty stable so is that an accurate statement."
14443.0,Patient,that's a very positive yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Yes, that's why I am here."
14443.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I think we you honestly it's about taking it slow and being careful, am I am I am I, allowing my emotions to let me. act out or am I responsibly addressing something right so do we have an emotional attachment. And that's how we're finding solutions or we trying to find solutions because we're clear mind, and we can getting engaged in a solution versus you know angry scared frightened overwhelmed we probably won't make good judgment calls on that only because the emotions attached. Because I think you're very emotional not emotional like bad I just think. there's a floodgates of things that go on and then you're trying to capture and more and maybe the way we act is based on this floodgate opening up and we need to say you know what I need to wait two minutes to allow this to pass and then i'll engage in a decision or thought process."
14443.0,Patient,"yeah I went for something similar to that like. Whenever I get really upset my friend, told me just like count to 10 seconds in my head is where I say something. Right."
214.0,Provider,"it's good advice, what we want is we. want pause. Before we have response and sometimes that's hard so it goes trigger response or trigger pause. response, and we know that if we pause we have a better outlook, but you know it's easy for me to save in the heat of the moment it's not that easy to pause because the emotion of the flood game is coming through and that's what causes the biggest you know issues."
14443.0,Patient,"Right, I will say that, in general I would consider myself a pretty calm person um. But. The past few weeks I last month. i've definitely lost my composure. When dealing with these very weird situations."
214.0,Provider,"But it looks like you're aware of your composure is based on emotion yeah. So now with that knowledge, we may be able to change the outcome of composure because we're not going to allow the emotion, the entanglement of the emotion to come out actually going to be in a different state and then proceed. it's just a thought process that I think if you slow it down a little bit ultimately it'll be healthier for you. You have a need to be heard. And that's how you react you react by. However, and that's your way of saying I need you to hear me. But the idea is, we can still hear you in a manner that we can engage in a conversation versus it may be difficult for someone to engage in the conversation because of what they're seeing right. So if you want the reception to be. Positive, then we have to think about so you know when we're about to engage in this in my addressing it in a positive manner, or is the emotion addressing the manner. Just thinking do a lot of if you could do a lot of pausing it would be helpful. I know it's different difficult, not because it's difficult because you can't do it it's like you want me to remember something at the time, already in it that becomes difficult. I know I know I get it, so how often do you see boyfriend."
14443.0,Patient,"um. Maybe about like. Five days a week, like the weekends and then like. A couple days throughout the week."
214.0,Provider,And is that a good balance for you to finish off all the things that you're responsible that you want to do in your life.
14443.0,Patient,yeah sometimes we go to library together to get.
214.0,Provider,"So there you go, so it seems like a good balance, and I think that's what you have to always maintain when you're feeling like discord or you're like yeah i'm off, you need to save yourself so where where Am I not balancing. Where did I. Where did I put all my eggs in one basket and I need to be more diverse, and I think if you can do that you'll find yourself being more in homeostasis more pleasant more happy."
14443.0,Patient,"yeah it's definitely gotten better now it's I think when school started and things are still very tense um. We would spend a lot of hours talking about the same thing i'm. not getting work done, because we were just focusing on fixing. Problems and now I."
214.0,Provider,would go to.
14443.0,Patient,Like less of it more.
214.0,Provider,Because. So it looks like you did just survey. The one for October still not done to that when you can try to do that for me. um. Let me just see something else yeah how's the group going on Monday.
14443.0,Patient,"Good the past two or three groups I started talking, I think the last two um but everyone was really kind and responsive. So it's slowly growing on me."
214.0,Provider,"i'm glad, and do you know our next deployment."
14443.0,Patient,shot I think it's 430 on.
214.0,Provider,awesome and do you also know you have a peer support on November.
14443.0,Patient,"wellness session of five. yeah Okay, yes, and then therapy at something."
214.0,Provider,"Correct. Because i'm i'm in a place for my internet's going in and out and they're telling me the end it's kind of cold out again. I am yeah it's. been a been a disaster, this week, but I think all know let's let's think about this intervention let's think about working. Point solution without emotional attachment, and if we're emotionally attached, can we take a pause for a moment and then get into what we need to does that sound like something we can work on. Alright, so I don't want to cut out on you so when we pick up this is where we'll pick off from whether or not we were able to detach from the emotion movie making decisions okay. Listen keep up the great work and I look forward to seeing you on the 19th."
14443.0,Patient,All right.
214.0,Provider,bye bye.
14443.0,Patient,And then that.
