324.0,Provider,football.
15513.0,Patient,i'm still on the 60 million rooms. And I still have pretty much a constant really bad headache.
324.0,Provider,"Okay, are you talking."
15513.0,Patient,Just title it on the eve and that's it.
324.0,Provider,"Okay, and what. What is this. Because we're doing three weeks so."
15513.0,Patient,it's. Only been three weeks on the 60.
324.0,Provider,"Okay, so we went on the 28."
15513.0,Patient,"He said I don't remember how long I was already on it, though."
324.0,Provider,"You know 16 now for this long. that's. What i'm saying is, you should. not still be having. Okay that's not two weeks ago. So yeah and I want to say even before that. This will definitely be the third week. For. For. Okay, I definitely need you to keep like a like a middle journal, or even jot it down so that you're keeping up with how long. How long you're. Okay, so. What on something you said headache."
15513.0,Patient,"headache and my anxiety constantly feels like something. really like really bad is going to happen. The depression is a lot worse and heavier like I noticed it and I feel sick like the first thing in the morning. Yes, but i'm staying asleep a falling asleep has been harder than usual. And then I wake up and it it really doesn't feel like I went to sleep at all."
324.0,Provider,About. about your appetite.
15513.0,Patient,It just changes from like being really nauseous and no appetite to high appetite. I mean not really anything different.
324.0,Provider,Different.
15513.0,Patient,"Last time we met like it's always. um. it's. there's lots of self harm lately but um well the suicidal thoughts are always there like, if I had an option. That was viable and painless I would probably take it. But that's not."
324.0,Provider,"Total serotonin syndrome i'm doing a search on. Google, which you were 14. Okay you're three weeks now. Even if we weren't to four weeks I think two weeks, you should say something should be you know understand withdraw the three weeks. Welcome to another week of the 16th."
15513.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,Once we moved to 40 I definitely want you to go ahead and start to speak. To try to counterbalance with the. Okay how's your car.
15513.0,Patient,"I think I have like maybe. I have no idea I have, I have a good amount of 20th left. But can I just have a refill, just in case, so I can just get it whenever. it's out or a little bit before it's out."
324.0,Provider,"What we may end up having to do. And a pharmacist might have to cope with this, the you know back to the bean counting because we're going in increments of 20 because that's what they come in. It might be a case of. Your 60. Instead of dropping down to 40. Even dropping down to the. or 50."
15513.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,"Can I do that, but it would take counting the beads to do that and that's what a pharmacist will come in. Because you have to know exactly how many bees are in each capsule."
15513.0,Patient,Should I open it and county.
324.0,Provider,"i'm gonna have to do some research on that. i've never had anybody counting fees I don't know how many bees are in each capsule so. So that's a pharmacy question um. I don't even know. If I looked it up. that's what it looks like it's gonna take. Okay. Now here but it's. 40 milligram capsule. Because if that's the case that we're actually. gonna actually do a 30 in a time capsule. To get off of the. taper down to a 50. Okay. Okay, so. Okay, so what we'll do when we're down to we won't even go to 40 will drop down to it."
15513.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"That would help us is still very helpful not only being. capital. Okay. Okay, be counting method can only be done if you're. Okay brand name or generic. containing. doesn't say it says hundreds of these well that's not. telling me anything. Okay, you cannot mix 40 milligrams and 60 milligram capsules as the beans contain a different amount. So. My question would be. Okay. This is based on a 60 milligram capsule. For the game you're taking. In the 20s are not going to have a sign on I would be. But as saying you know 60 milligram capsule their average being cow is around two frontrunners. The type of those accounting beads one will be 180 beats month to 160 to be what 342 and 28. Okay looks like. Two things. Read each those out over for four weeks now. And instead of decrease in increments of. 20. We can decrease by 10."
15513.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,But again it's going to take the beat counting now or 250 you going to do another weekend with. His mother bring into another we've been sick thing. and
15513.0,Patient,So the pharmacist has 50s.
324.0,Provider,Now.
15513.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,It comes in a burden.
15513.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,Another thing to make the. To make up 50 we would have to use a 30 and 20.
15513.0,Patient,"Okay, so I need a month of 30 days in a month of."
324.0,Provider,"Oh we're gonna have to do. What we. Believe from. Actually, that would be a problem, because we will drop it down to 10. us. which will be for you so that's not an issue. For. me. This down. For. One more week. 60 milligrams. Then we're gonna move to 5040. and start with us, and then we need 30 milligrams and we need 20. And we have, I mean, these are 20 castle. And then we'll do 40 milligrams and then we'll do 30 milligrams. And then 24 weeks. 40 will not be upon because we will use the 220 30 won't be a problem because we'll use a 30 of course 20 is not a problem."
15513.0,Patient,How do I get 10s do they make. Should I like once i'm down to 20.
324.0,Provider,"Are gonna be can be. Okay, because they're just still half of them out."
15513.0,Patient,Okay. Okay.
324.0,Provider,um. yeah we get to that point. So we're looking. Okay. So this is week three so we're going to do 60 milligrams next week. Right. yeah okay. So starting on the 23rd This is just. A tentative calendar year schedule. Other 23rd. We should be starting.
15513.0,Patient,OK.
324.0,Provider,And then that will be.
15513.0,Patient,"My pharmacy usually takes like two days or three days to fill things so maybe. The beginning of that week can we order the 20s and the 30s to be sent, because I think i'll be out of 20s by them."
324.0,Provider,Around. Everywhere February.
15513.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,we're looking. At.
15513.0,Patient,Wait oh February February okay.

15513.0,Patient,"OK, so the 20th of every."
324.0,Provider,"morning, or at the 23rd would start to 50 will do for some 50. of your 20th should take us supporting. And then starting march one. We should be starting 30. So that i'll know where we are."
15513.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"And then. will be happily. My. idea. um. yeah so we're. going to do 1020. And what i'll do is i'm. i'm not only the way to next week i'm gonna send it in today. Okay, that way."
15513.0,Patient,20s and 30s.
324.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Are you going to do another week on 16. Actually, on a sound bar with. Maybe the same. It is. It does have a long half one is called a walk across paper. Okay, or greeting. When you get to 40 so. Even with the phones is about starting with the pristine. yeah so basically I was already saying hey doctor suggests a volatile cymbalta 30 to 40 milligrams and switch to 10 milligrams a week overlap."
15513.0,Patient,"Is me, you should take both medications for a week and then drop the ball on day, eight."
324.0,Provider,and continue to contact.
15513.0,Patient,"Okay, can you type it in an email because i'm all confused."
324.0,Provider,"Well i'm just reading this business with Prozac goes with. Christie either way to recommends when you get to 40 milligrams because the issue is you don't want to. Again restaurant and have your opponent that's all we really need to be a little lower those with the symbolism. And exactly what i'm saying as cymbalta isn't isn't on Prozac is this article about together if you're running the risk of serotonin syndrome just what I was saying it's all of this is on the website, but. website. yeah i'm. Going into 40 milligrams is where. This really where we want to be before we start anything else. We want. To any issues."
15513.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"I run the risk of serotonin syndrome, so now we're going to stick with the plan. We get around 40 grams. And even this website is, and the same thing is we're going to use. That to help cross paperweight to get around 30 or 40 milligrams so. we're not there yet. Okay yeah we're just going to like I say take it a little slower will take it over four weeks. um if. And again, instead of dropping in. 20 milligram increments we're going to drop it in 10 milligram. Okay, if need be. In between there and we have to do it in five then we'll do that at that point, though it is going to take care of the beads to do it. we'll just. If that's what it takes I don't want you feeling miserable. yeah so. So let's say we're going to take it England school. And then we can. But today i'm going to go ahead and send the 20s and 30s. Okay, so they'll be there. And then they don't follow me."
15513.0,Patient,So you just have to show up wait in. line and then maybe they have nothing.

Recording Eric anxiety. i'm feeling like something bad is going to happen feeling sick first thing in the morning she's on her third week. Of 60 milligrams so we're going to extend it for another week. or we're going to do is just take over four weeks you're such a difficult time. still hard. To. Do because he was saying asleep working attire. For appetite changes not there from heaven, not every time to have a nausea that have a high appetite. Nice and so on behaviors. that she.
