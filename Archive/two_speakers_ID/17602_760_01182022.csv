17602.0,Patient,"My stepdad and I didn't know at the time, like it didn't go through my brain that oh that's that's abuse. Even though it really should have because it was clearly the is because it was like a moment and where. i'm. cute got mad at my sister and I."

17602.0,Patient,"He had grabbed us by the hair and then pull this off the ground, they all get us and whatnot and. I had never told anyone that before, but I I I had never had therapy before."
760.0,Provider,"And then, after a few sessions, I was like I felt comfortable and I was like maybe I could tell you that just to get it off my chest because i've never said anything before."
17602.0,Patient,"And I didn't want to do anything I didn't want her to say anything but since I was under 18 shoot classified, that is something that she needed that she couldn't keep between."
760.0,Provider,us.

760.0,Provider,"Okay, so I got scared. yeah that's that's that's men, we are mandated reporters I like yeah so you're aware of that now yeah she."
17602.0,Patient,She had explained that to me. Before on.
760.0,Provider,"She explained that to me before when we first started and Linda first session to like oh so this, and this, and these are the rules."
17602.0,Patient,"Okay that's understandable and but I didn't and classify what I said at something like that, and so I was confused at first, but then later I understood, and I was like oh yeah that really. really was something that night because I thought I thought, since it was so long ago that it it it."
760.0,Provider,looks good I thought that she would not to say anything um but she should be something that we need to tell your dad and.
17602.0,Patient,"I was like Oh, you can tell him and then she brought him in after this session and then she told him, but the thing that I told him and then he was very upset and um. I, I was surprised, though well not really but I was a little bit surprised by the reaction. On me because I was kind of. So I had learned like from that like i've learned over time in the past year or so that on my dad said of the family, like my my. cousins and aunts aka my dad's high school friends and stuff for kids and blah blah blah all that um. They no one, no one ever liked my mom or my step dad which. I never really understood."
760.0,Provider,It but.
17602.0,Patient,"There were things like because I will i'm my mom doesn't really tell me anything which i'm figuring out now, and she lives a lot and."
760.0,Provider,"Also i've also figured out now. When my dad was still married to my mom and she said that that that that that was that was what that was, and so I was like Okay, but she lied to me and apparently she had cheated. On my dad with the man that she still with my step dad."
17602.0,Patient,"And so I because my cousin told me she didn't know that I didn't know, though. And so she's like."
760.0,Provider,"Oh yes, i'm cheated on your dad blah blah."
17602.0,Patient,"blah, and I was like wait what."
760.0,Provider,"Oh, she was like yeah and."
17602.0,Patient,"i'm like wait wait cuz it was like a real shocker to me, and so I it took me a. few minutes process. was like hold on, let me just wire this number and brain right now, or are you serious, are you joking with me like asking you that i'm like are you are you joking, are you just playing around Is this a Is this a prank and she's like she's like no she. Then she said, and then she said that my mom and she cheated on my dad with dawn my step dad and then I frickin lost it, I was like I was like don and she's like calm down broke that almost like calm down calm down my mother lied to me and cheated on my father. Was the man that she is. Still with. So."
760.0,Provider,And a man that was not very nice to you.
17602.0,Patient,yeah. I was just I was infuriated and she's like well things happen and i'm like. This i'm still mad at her and. I. thought about it yesterday. It may sound harsh but. I feel like I feel like I would be happier without my mother. I know it's like. I just noticed that. Even the slightest mention of my mom of like visiting her and stuff stresses out and when i'm around her when I talked to her. Just my anxiety and my depression just becomes worse.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's a config seems like brooke there's a complete lack of safety with her yeah and."
17602.0,Patient,"And then, because one minute when i'm here at home with my dad. And we're all talking about how oh my mom did this and my step dad did that they act this way and then it's like i'm so mad at them. And I don't want a relationship with them and then, when I move around them, and they act like nothing happened, and they act all like their own such great parents and Goody two shoes and all the law, then. Then I think for a second maybe maybe it's all in my head, maybe i'm a bad person and i'm just overthinking this. So I get that's also why I don't like going over there."
760.0,Provider,Is this is me and then that. and
17602.0,Patient,"So, but as soon as I come back home like oh I don't I don't like them and then. had asked them if if if they would. Go to family therapy with me, but then because I figured because I heard about my. My uh my older sisters my stepsisters. Who one of them, she has. She doesn't come over and she last time I saw her. Was. I was a sophomore year of high school. Maybe um and I saw on that Christmas, and that was the first time I ever saw her since I was eight years old."
760.0,Provider,And so it was like.
17602.0,Patient,"She I did I had no idea, she was coming she was just there and I freaked I was like oh my God. My sister's home. And cuz she. Even. When I was eight, the last time it was funny because it was well it wasn't funny, but it was ironic. But the last time that I had seen her when I was eight. was on Christmas and. dawn and her got into an argument don who is her real biological dad. They got into an argument, I do not know what it was about, but he was yelling at her and screaming at her and then she started crying and their argument and blah blah and then he starts throwing a fit again actual fit like a five year old and he throws down the tree and he breaks everything."
760.0,Provider,screaming.
17602.0,Patient,And so we like ruins Christmas for everybody is on Christmas morning not.
760.0,Provider,Breaking the tree wow.
17602.0,Patient,yeah it's Christmas morning and so everybody's like everybody's like crying now because he threw down the tree and the screaming at our sister and. she walked out that door and she never came back.
760.0,Provider,Until that day on Christmas.
17602.0,Patient,On software you year.
760.0,Provider,and
17602.0,Patient,My other sister my other step sister really who's just they're both in their 20s I.
760.0,Provider,don't actually know exactly how old they are because I don't really get to talk to them.
17602.0,Patient,"But. rainy rainy alyssa the oldest and then really. Really, I guess she from when I hear she talks to dawn and stuff but alyssa. alyssa left before really did when I was younger and so. It was like a custody thing where they would visit on the weekends and stuff but then lissa stopped going and then. Really gradually stopped going to like effort should come on weekends and then she kind of came of a kind of him every other weekend and then she would only come like a few times a month and then she just stopped because. It would be like an argument with her and dawn because. They never go outside they don't do anything ever they do the same thing every day."
760.0,Provider,and your mother and your stepfather.
17602.0,Patient,"yeah and they've done that, for years, my my brother's like. The only outside connection that the the person who has the outside connection the most i'd say of. Everyone besides my grandpa. My youngest brother Isaac who's seven."
760.0,Provider,"And he goes to school, which is like just up the hill from the House and. So he goes to school like he kind of has to."
17602.0,Patient,"Because it would be way too difficult for my mom town, then homeschool."
760.0,Provider,yeah and okay.
17602.0,Patient,yeah even though isn't in homeschool and what she shouldn't I don't I don't think he should be like because it's not helping them at all and. Like he's a he's a smart kid like they're both smart kids like Isaac Isaac can read and type words like when he was five he.
760.0,Provider,"went in typed refrigerator or TV, it was TV up on the fridge and little letters and."
17602.0,Patient,"Is magnetic letters and he just put up TV, the word and. Like he's he's really good at that, but he can't speak and then gannon."
760.0,Provider,he's.
17602.0,Patient,"he's like super smart and has a lot of like data knowledge in his head like if he likes a certain topic, he can tell you anything about it, like he loves dinosaurs and. he's really, really good at drawing. And like you want to know anything about dinosaurs just asked him literally and but then he he's 13."
760.0,Provider,man.
17602.0,Patient,"that's not their fault that's actually my mom's fault and their their dad's fault, because. My mom won't. She won't use all of the resources that Isaac is given to learn how to communicate."
760.0,Provider,"and So she's not she's not protecting him she's not preparing him so it seems like in that household all kids are in some way unsafe yeah so it kind of makes sense to me why you. don't feel like going over there, because I know you've got a lot of. Depression and anxiety that you're coping with already. So I wanted to kind of bring this back a little bit brooklyn and. or brooke you don't be called brooklyn right."
17602.0,Patient,yeah that's okay.
760.0,Provider,"To. see what what, what do you want to get from these sessions. We need to develop what i'll call a treatment plan and the treatment plan is, at the end of the day, it's your plan, but it's something that you and I work through together to kind of see what are some of this concrete steps you want to take to get better. So it's not up to me to say you know I can make you some suggestions, but at the end of the day, it's for you to decide, I want to do that or i'm ready to do that, I want to do that kinds of things so. You said a lot about not wanting to go to work and not wanting to go out so so you you. How how often are you leaving the House right now is that only to go to work or do you do have other activities that you leave the House. Most of the time, most of what I when I go out is just to go to work and I work like I said, like three to four times a month. Okay. I try to go to the store when I can like if somebody and they asked me, sometimes."
17602.0,Patient,Other than work I can't go outside alone out public.
760.0,Provider,mom.
17602.0,Patient,Oh there it is sorry the notification wasn't showing up for it. Try to go out.
760.0,Provider,"I think yeah we talked about that that you have to be like really kind of close to them as you're walking up and down the aisles yeah and. every night i've had them for years things every night every night and. i've been taking the medicine that they gave me and they said it and how long How long have you been on the medicine, you said you just got back on it, but how many weeks Have you taken a consistency consistently."
17602.0,Patient,"i've taken it other than since I was not on it, because I didn't have my meds yet."
760.0,Provider,i've been on it every night since.
17602.0,Patient,"I got them and I was on they gave me them, while I was in the hospital."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's been more than three weeks."
17602.0,Patient,yeah it's been more than three weeks definitely.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you think the medication is working, or do you think the medications not working, I don't think it's working all it's not doing anything in fact my nightmares has just gotten worse."
17602.0,Patient,"One minute i'm. Okay, with going outside when it's dark out and listening to some music, because I like. I like I like oh i'll i'll go outside on walks on private room by myself when it's dark because i'm i'm not scared because there's nobody around and nobody can see me because it's dark out, and so I feel fine."
760.0,Provider,Is it physically safe to do that on the private road. where you live.
17602.0,Patient,yeah on the private road that we have it's it's it's fine.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17602.0,Patient,"In fact it's it's probably better than walking during the day, because that way at night, I can see the cars coming down the road with the lights. So, but in the day, if I walk I have to keep turning my head to make sure i'm not going to get hit, and I mean I stay on the side but it's still I gotta look just to make sure, but then that really hurts my neck, so it makes it better to walk at night on the private road. Although. Last night I did. walk farther. than I have. Ever in a long, long long long long, long time. And like I walked off the private road. I I been having these feelings of like just like running away from home, not that it would really be like running away from home."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, just that does that are you having unsafe thoughts about hurting yourself in any way when you feel like that."
17602.0,Patient,"No, no, when I feel like that, because it's like. But my feelings are kind of unpredictable now I feel like occur and so. I don't like one minute on just be sitting in my room watching TV on my laptop because I usually."
760.0,Provider,I usually just sleep eat now and then watch. meditation and affirmations stuff by how often are you using those.
17602.0,Patient,"And like because, like I said the other night I couldn't stop crying and I, it was like like I have those breakdowns like we're like I can't stop crying and I just feel horrible, but it was like. I had never felt like that, before it was like I felt like. So."
760.0,Provider,Was gonna like dive a broken heart like literally like.
17602.0,Patient,"Because I got scared for a moment and it freaked out, I thought I was going to. And then, for another moment when I felt like that I was like maybe the better if I did. Because I just, then it would go away at least."
760.0,Provider,"that's what I thought, so they your heart was up because of anxiety you think at the time."
17602.0,Patient,"yeah like stress and stuff. I have, I have crying sessions, like every day, but like not I mean because i'm i'm i'm always stressed out always sad."
760.0,Provider,"What do you do you do talk to do have a support in your family are there, people there in the home with you that you talk to regularly or are you pretty much to yourself, most of the time. And who you live with your father, I remember that it was lives in the home with you and your dad um there's my sister my uncle and then my dad's to remain two roommates Jessica and Carol. Okay, so. So, you mentioned that you're doing the affirmations every day, are you trying to do that. Several times a day or how do you do that i'm usually I do before bed."
17602.0,Patient,"or or I do it like just a little bit like if i'm feeling stressed out, I tried to take myself i'm like i'm calm i'm happy."
760.0,Provider,I loan title blah blah blah. and
17602.0,Patient,"I try really hard to believe it, and when I do that, like in the moment warm stressed, it doesn't really help, but then I tried to listen to this like like some videos of self affirmation like self love and stuff before bed that's like 15 minutes long."
760.0,Provider,"20 minutes long and I just repeat it, and what it says in the video twice. Okay. And I do Okay, do you think that that helps you brooklyn and how long have you been doing that, a few days, maybe okay just Okay, do you think it's helping you or do you think everything actually you said, your symptoms are getting worse, I thought it was helping me at first. Okay."
17602.0,Patient,it's like a.
760.0,Provider,"part that maybe you don't believe some of the affirmations that you're saying is there, like a lack of belief, as you're thinking these things, or perhaps saying them out loud or listening to it well in a video At first it was like that was like."
17602.0,Patient,"Oh, it was hard to say the things because I didn't believe them, but then I would say, repeatedly and then I would come up kind of start to believe them like a wouldn't."
760.0,Provider,Like I don't believe them and then it would just be like okay I don't.
17602.0,Patient,believe them but I don't not believe them and then it was starting.
760.0,Provider,"Starting ish to believe them just a little bit, but now just. whatnot I would try to find something that. Is. More believer leave, I have one that I I have actually I should probably move it behind me it's like right over my computer here over your head, where you can't see it, it says, you are braver than you believe stronger than you seem and smarter than you think oh yeah or not one. So that one is a little bit it allows for a lack of belief. And, and perhaps maybe being a little bit you know you can use the same one for several days. Even several weeks, as long as that you find it helpful and maybe trying to find something doesn't have to be that exact one, but something that allows for. You know. allows for the lack of belief. Okay, so that that would be one suggestion. So what what are you doing during the day. To when you get up or you say you have a hard time getting up out of bed in the morning. What do you do. To cope when you wake up feeling overwhelmed. Well, I kind of force myself to get up and then i'm supposed to do, because the first thing that i'm supposed to do when I wake up is. Cut vegetables to feed the chickens and stuff and then Okay, so you have chores to do yeah and then i'm do some."
17602.0,Patient,"I mean, I used to do a lot more than that."
760.0,Provider,"More I just grab a snack of not or something, are you eating how many times a day, do you think you're consistent with eating meals brooke is that something you want to work towards um."
17602.0,Patient,well.
760.0,Provider,"My psychiatrist nailed psychiatrists who diagnosed me with binge eating disorder and I mean, but now I just I don't really eat all that much."
17602.0,Patient,"I mean I kind of do it's like. I mean, I have from past two days but um."
760.0,Provider,"Probably have dessert and then i'll have a snack later okay so you're eating a minimum of once if not twice or even three times a day yeah Okay, so you don't go for a day without missing meals. Okay, because it can be compulsive we can be compulsive with our eating when we overeat and when we under eat. So you some you think sometimes you've had a problem with overeating in the past and now sometimes you think you have a problem with under eating is that fair to say."
17602.0,Patient,I have a problem with kind of.
760.0,Provider,"sort of like because, like i'll just wait until the end of the day, to chow down on food and stuff because, like."
17602.0,Patient,"By the end of the day, by dinner time i'll be."
760.0,Provider,Real hungry hungry and so then i'll eat dinner and then i'll have seconds and then i'll.
17602.0,Patient,"Have dessert if there isn't any and usually there is, because we always have sweets and house. And they have like a snack a few hours later, and then we'll have another snack."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, and you said that you're having nightmares every night is that the same nightmare know it's."
17602.0,Patient,Last night. Sometimes I remember the nightmares sometimes I don't.
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes I remember them very, very, very well like it's like I. So you wake up feeling extremely extremely anxious then yeah yeah yeah I mean."
17602.0,Patient,I am. Like like i'll feel like a five year old who's afraid of monsters under the bed or in the closet or.
760.0,Provider,Just general general formless kind of fears. But yeah and feeling like something is there.
17602.0,Patient,"I have so many nightmares and then I have such horrible ones that it's like this point, I don't. My nightmares were just like a warning that they were real or something and then they were coming to get me or something and that's how I kind of described in the corner, because I was scared. And everybody was asleep, though, so I couldn't like."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so what maybe was one. What do you, what do you do to cope in those moments when they anxiety so overpowering do you do you have a coping skill to not really not really. So you're you're feeling from from what from this conversation, and also the last one brooke you seem like you feel unsafe both. All day and even into your dreams, because of the nightmares. So that's the struggle with you. Alright, so getting back we're getting down to the last little bit of our session so I want to. there's there's a concept called grounding. And there's a concept called. mindfulness. That would be something that you could use to kind of turn down the anxiety or the depression from like let's say anything anytime it reaches like that number six or higher on a scale of one to 10 to turn it down to make it more manageable. Would you like me to send you information on how to do grounding. yeah. that'd be good, let me, let me just we have we only have a few minutes, but let me just pull it up, so you can see it Okay, and I will email it to you i'll let me have your email first so brooke oh it's. Okay, look for me to send this and they just pull it up for you to see. I have a question sure. My dad's roommate."
17602.0,Patient,"She she pops up behind me or or she, like the other day I just looked up and she was like right in front walking to me, and then I just I kind of jumped."

And blah blah blah, and then I just don't feel like I should have to explain myself to her, so I don't really try out some sometimes if you don't you need to make sure that you're sharing your story with people who are safe and the perhaps. Perhaps. she's being triggered by something maybe she's sensing something in you that's triggering her own. pains and Traumas from her own past I don't know. it's not you you've tried to reach out to her, but you don't want to. You know you you don't want to expose yourself further. You can just simply say it, I don't think you're going to hit me. You know and and just try to do your best to to walk away. She does it sounds like she's not a real nice person no she's not and I thought I thought that I just needed a break, because when I was gone for so long for those months.

The problem brought up the more you stay in that room, the more the anxieties gone to build so looking for safe ways to challenge that. With some coping skills, I am going to go ahead, we don't really have a lot of time left in the hour so i'm going to go ahead and send you. These grounding exercises, it should be self explanatory so, would you be willing to read it on your own and start start doing grounding when you get up in the morning. If you have a negative interaction with the roommate this woman that you were talking about earlier. or anytime you notice your anxiety or depression, to be at six or higher start practicing grounding and and at least three times a day. and start developing coping skills to to cope with all these things. And then to look for ways to get out of the House. Even if you do have to walk close to your dad. I think it would be good for you, if you could get out at least three times a week. Would that be something that. Or is that too much. I could, I could try but um I also like I can't. usually only have the option to go out if i'm wanting to force myself whenever somebody else is going on, yes. Yes, yeah I mean. it's not.

All right, well i'm going to send you these grounding exercises for you to practice and then. Maybe have a conversation, would you be willing to have a conversation with your dad that you know I want to go to the store with you. whenever you go and try to go once or twice a week, just to get out of the House to go with that because I want you to focus first with the people you build them all safe. Is that something you're willing to do yeah okay okay. Okay, is that, because just the more you stay home, the more you give in to the anxiety, the more the anxiety is going to build yeah so something you know i'm going to encourage some baby steps.
