And at one, something I talked to the prescription people and he said he was going to do it when I call my pharmacy at four, so I hadn't been done so I don't know so going out my medicine and I used that before and as a pain control to so. it's been kind of difficult and and hurting pretty bad last couple days."

16704.0,Patient,"So I have this locked into rite aid. So I have to have them send it to write a this one time until care source can put in a request for my locked in pharmacy to be her stroke, where I need to go because it's closer to where I am now. So, instead of having them the curse words going ahead and doing it, I didn't want to. get everything messed up, I wanted to be able to get it at this time, whether I paid for it to her sure got it set tonight as. Well, I didn't come up with the money to pay for it to her, so I waited till. Today I tried Saturday, of course, you guys are open, they don't have an air Saturday, so I called this morning and been trying all day I found the gut to the. rx people and he said he would do everything he sounded like you know asked about how long because I also don't drive. So I have an eight year old my grandpa who's going to drive the pants and night so he's been waiting all day to take me and which is a. possibility but now he's really tired he's a farmer and he's just sitting here waiting awaiting and I don't know what to do, I got trying and i'm carrying around my phone he doesn't understand technology like look I. tried to talk to somebody I don't know. If you call and talk to some guy and then he said, well, you need to go to compliance and put me in some other own for compliance, but I was in there forever and then I needed to. Get be able to talk to you, you know get my appointment, so I just went out of it and try to go back in a column or go back to the clinic but they're too busy that they couldn't I couldn't even get in."
418.0,Provider,And so.
16704.0,Patient,"I had to see him for you, I went to click I put down to their 10 minutes and you click into you. And I go right back."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so here's what we're gonna do this is what we're gonna do we're gonna do some ground rules first first thing is what's the first initial of your last name Mickey. Okay first initial last name is see this is Mickey. First time in an individual session, and right now, the biggest issue is she's struggling. to receive her medication, so we want to work on reaching i'm going to reach out to Julie. See if there's anything she can do and i'm also going to reach out to the rx team to see what they can help with on is as far as my end as far as pushing a little bit after our session i'd like you to go ahead and try to call the pharmacy see if they have it ready. See if it's coming in at all, because they are usually pretty good with that once I can tell you this once we get started. You probably won't have this problem again because it's just getting started in the beginning, and I hate it for you that you haven't been able to receive your medicine, but I am glad that you haven't had a relapse when's the last time you used."
16704.0,Patient,"To be honest, heroin has been 2017. Okay, and then crack and methamphetamine and it's been less today it's probably been close to a month, if not a Muslim it over."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so those are your primary job to choice. heroin and crack a myth okay good."
16704.0,Patient,"yeah my daughter died of a central overdose two years ago she was 19 I don't see, though ever touch heroin again. Right after she died, I went on a crack bench for about a year until I ended up in jail and prison at 44 years old. 43 to 44 in prison had never been in trouble, they went to a halfway house for 10 months and got October 23, and here I am."
418.0,Provider,"Now, but when I."
16704.0,Patient,"When I got out, I chose, which I knew better I got my CDC a while I was in i'm in the halfway house and five in my license with the state and at this point. i'm not quite ready yet, because when I got out I knew better, but I went to a place that I knew. The people places and things and I didn't I got there, and of course I you know I relapse I thought it was going to be strong enough, you know this girl needed help her time to died. of an overdose and she's my friend, and I was going to go help or, you know as go saver yeah that didn't work I just my life became unmanageable and 22 days until I know I got. I walked out of there and I never I haven't gone back I won't let myself, my father and learn to reach out when I. I felt the urge to us last week real real bad it was real hard my head started playing and how to do it, but I reached out to people and they talked me down from it, and I was all right. mm hmm so."
418.0,Provider,"That is really, really. Really unfortunate and but i'm glad that you got back as quick as you did you see how it doesn't take long does it."
16704.0,Patient,"Now, and i've chosen, I have an apartment and we had field, I don't know if you're familiar with mansfield or anything but. I live right now i'm staying at a small town like 20 miles from there, but having department i'm not saying the apartment i'm giving it back I didn't even stay in it for the month i'm choosing because I realized I can't stay there. I can't live in that city there's too many people too many places and too many things. i'm going to my daughter that passed away her grandkids never been a mile for me now my sister has one so right now choosing to stay where i'm at for a little bit to kind of help her with the kids and do with the kids but i'm thinking long term going to Cleveland possibly. Somewhere away from here, I i'm not there there's too much here there's too many memories too many people. it's too easy and i'm i've been married 28 years but been separated for three like four days before 25th anniversary he texted me he wanted a divorce so that's you know he's around here to which we're still friends, but it's all just not."
418.0,Provider,good enough not.
16704.0,Patient,To do it.
418.0,Provider,So that's. So that's something that that we're working on and also is. You don't want to be around people who use and that's a good thing. i'm going to think i'm thinking that we will work on identifying triggers and and cravings and know what the differences between the two of them. How long have you been addicted.
16704.0,Patient,"1997. Maybe 9697 I started out with travel awful migraines when it first came out, it was still and. So in the sample packets, when I first started doing it, and I was so against drugs, there was not going to be in your drugs in my house my kids aren't you know my husband smoked weed. drank this stuff I wasn't gonna allow it, and then, once I started taking that things kind of started going a little bit downhill from that i've had several surgeries and a lot of medical issues. So I was on pain medication for real reasons it was I taken out like I was supposed to all the time now. And then, when my doctor i've moved to. And I couldn't invited the doctor so, then I went to the streets door knocks he's doing other medications the ox is got too expensive, so we went to heroin and from there, it was just years of. Being high. Until 2017 I took I took charges for my daughter, we were on the way to Detroit her dude who's a dope boy in my grandson and his three family members and. We got pulled over and either every day we're going to get you know she was going to get charged with a felony 18 you know her do it instead I did nothing I did have a needle in the van but nothing else was mine but I took the charges for all of it which put me on five year paper. Prison over my head, I went over three years, without any trouble then after she died, you know I spun out of control and ended up getting in trouble with a misdemeanor. which gave me a while violate probation violation which the judge sent me to 18 months flat so off, I went and it was it was bad, but. I feel like God. Does things to help us, even though it's not what we want, so I kind of feel like he said, you know you're you're going to sit down, you know, like, I was really wild and out of control, worse than I ever had in my life and. He just kind of pulled me back is how I feel. Okay, and and I learned. I did a lot with myself like paid off my. paid off my misdemeanor fines paid off my suspension, my main statement fee got my CCA education done, I did all these things, not because they offered it, you know, but because I wanted it and I wanted to do better for myself when I got out. Like I said it didn't work out too well, when I first got out which kind of then. Usually would have destroyed me. it's hard for me, because then I feel like i'm the disappointment, you know, like I have all these plants, you know all this stuff in my head that's going to happen that i'm going to do, and then it doesn't happen."
418.0,Provider,To me.
16704.0,Patient,"yeah but. Like everybody keeps telling me, maybe I need to slow down, you know I want everything I want everything now don't have patience, so now i'm just trying to take everything, one day, at a time i'm also in a lot of pain. Like have a kidney stone and I have gallbladder stones and I have a thing, called the interstitial cystitis in my bladder is falling out, I have a prolapse bladder I just seen the urologist last Wednesday I go back this one day. To do more tests oh there's surgeries that i'll probably have to have i'm not looking forward to that. So the pain, the pain even. With all the health issues, I have is really discouraging because that's what started me on this journey. And that's one reason why I never quit heroin is because I didn't want to hurt, I did not want to go back there you know I didn't want to go back to being in bed every day and in pain, I have fibromyalgia also So when I have flare ups it gets really bad. Again i'm trying to be a little bit nicer to myself."
418.0,Provider,"that's right. that's Okay, yes that's, the idea being nicer to yourself absolutely that's absolutely the idea. So i'm glad to hear you talking about that so we'll and what we normally what we do in our group is we build on that um, how do you like the group so far."
16704.0,Patient,I like yeah just one time i'm usually participate in group more but. yeah.
418.0,Provider,I know yeah yeah yeah.
16704.0,Patient,"A little bit of time to jump in there and open up more once I get more comfortable with it, but it was good it's definitely good, because where i'm at I couldn't get any brick and mortar type of program so i'm glad that I found something that I can do you know from here. So that's really good."
418.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, that sounds good i'm glad that you showed up tonight, so we have that. you've been using over about 20 years."
16704.0,Patient,yep.
418.0,Provider,"20 years more. But you do have a little clean time now you're not used her when over a year you. What is it three months, three months or three weeks."
16704.0,Patient,"Three weeks of. Further. stimulants it's bad about three weeks to a month for heroin spent 2017. I didn't do. yeah I didn't do any opiates at all, even when they did my I had my tonsils taken out, I still refused the pain medication, except for this. I went into the hospital and October from my kidney stones and I thought there, it can be toward all they gave me a DEMO I was so upset I cried. But then the next time I had to go back because it was worse I just had to take it, because the pain was so bad that there was nothing I could do. I wasn't on suboxone yet so when I got out I got much my regular physician who started back on the suboxone, then I got in with you guys so time is a double for me it keeps me from using you know, but it also helps with my pain so. um it's a two way thing for me."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, great so we'll be doing this and i'm glad that you made your appointment and we will definitely be working on. triggers and cravings will be working on, you know just building up your self esteem and. You know, I think that you'll enjoy it I think you're in a good place bright heart is a wonderful place. We love to do what we do and that's why we do it, and I think you'll be satisfied I am going to send out those notices to Julian to the rx team i'll. check back in a few minutes, hopefully to get you your medicine today okay."
16704.0,Patient,Okay So what do you need me to do then.
