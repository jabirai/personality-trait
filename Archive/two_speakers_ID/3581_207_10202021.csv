207.0,Provider,"Okay, the last time I did that. I think. we're a new. one."
3581.0,Patient,"Now that happened to my husband through like. Like he went through the drive thru at CBS and got like one of those rapid tests that you sent to a lab. and his came back negative when we knew he was positive, because everyone in the House at it, he had no taste, no smell, I mean he just checking off all the boxes on symptoms and his came back negative, but I don't think we got an accurate sample."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm. And then I got all. Three of them. they're expensive yeah that's I said I don't know.
3581.0,Patient,Why they're not the I mean they're not even FDA approved but.

207.0,Provider,hmm hmm you feel fishy and don't you.
3581.0,Patient,"Oh, I feel, important."
207.0,Provider,"Like I got my own office. Maybe do that when I was in turn. out, I was I didn't even get a cubicle I got a hallway."
3581.0,Patient,"No ma'am I got my own phone my own laptop my own office i'm here pretty soon, hopefully, my own clients, but yeah it's the deal."
207.0,Provider,With them we can't say nothing you know.
3581.0,Patient,"it's official now it's official but Rochelle it was so weird so like I sat in on my first it's called I O P, which is intensive outpatient it's a group for substance use. I sat there and i'm i'm watching the lady that runs it and. I felt like I was in the group doing work and not observed like she would ask questions and I found myself wanting to participate, because i'm used to."
207.0,Provider,used to participate and.
3581.0,Patient,"participating in group. So, like that caught me off guard and i'm like okay that's something I need to work on, because i'm not. In group here. And the other thing is because, like don't nobody know about my past, I do not disclose anything about my past. And don't you know the doctor at this facility hates suboxone."
207.0,Provider,um.
3581.0,Patient,"Now he's cool with sub located vivid trawl not suboxone he does. So, of course, I asked i'm like oh and he's like because people are out here, getting high off of it, and this that and the other, and you know i'm just listening and he goes, but I can't figure out why my patients keep relapsing on pivotal. And i'm going to slow. Down work. And like a lot of staff complain about this doctor because of that fact. Because the staff what what their clients to get the right help that they need and that doctor is just he has. me up and it's his beliefs, is all his beliefs and that's not a good doctor to me. So, but yeah it was crazy I just sit there and listen and listen and less like a fly on the wall."
207.0,Provider,"Oh. you're moving from one role to the next right you're moving from in this situation you're moving from the role or the place of being a patient or a client yourself to now. you're a provider wrong right a provider that can relate, in some ways, not in every way because everybody's issues and how they deal with it or unique to it within themselves because of our past and everything else but. we're all we all this is the thing we all have to be unbiased and like I always tell you, you talk and you ask for their advice approach I don't believe in a lot of things. Right does that mean i'm going to take that and i'm gonna put it on you and and be like well, you need to come over here because who's to say that my belief is the, this is the fail beyond, and this is the the one and only way right. Now here, it is that, from a doctor's perspective I think it's been open now that you've moved into this new role I think it's being open to hearing everyone's. opinion because that's what it comes down to everything does come down from opinion there is no one shoe fits all type of things right, because if there was every single therapist. will operate in the same exact way they will diagnose the same exact way and everything will be you wouldn't need 100 centers because you know they want to share when this one can do the same exact thing. Right, it was the same flavor right. So when you hear this doctor based on his medical expertise and his years of experience, or what have you and he says okay. Therefore medication and each medication, this is how it operates right and based on my years of experience in working with me for medications I find that. People relax more on the reversal, why is that when I do my research and statistics or whatever, and it shows that, not to say that people don't realize, why on suboxone, however. You know you find more people relaxing on vitro, why is that what's the difference between the two. and based on his comeback, you know whether or not, are you giving me your unbiased support or This is just all about what you feel in your beliefs or whatever it is, then you will know hey I hear you, but all right buddy. Because, at the end of the day it is what is the protocol so. I would always say yes, this is about suboxone treatment program or what have you but you've always heard me say listen at the end of the day, suboxone only treat the symptom that's all the. norm it's not getting to the cause of the problem. tylenol only she says that the sentence, but it doesn't get to the core of the problem. And so, though, you have all these different medications ideally that does you know somewhat the same things all all of them have the book The chemical compound and all of it is always different in each one right. Something that's a little different in each one So if you say Okay, well, I find that with the box and not only i'm doing this, but it's also. It requires me to also get individual constantly requires that I also do this it's requiring all these other thing. So the reason why you don't find a lot of people relaxing on it's not that they can, or they can't get addicted or whatever it is. But then I find that they do all of this, in addition to taking the men, whereas with this all you're required to do is just you take that you go on your merry way and you're only given. Ryan. So you understand, so now, you can step back and you say hey well let's my experience with suboxone. When you're looking at the chemical compounds and the disposition, and the makeup of the whole drug itself, all these different drugs at the end of the day, it's how are you going about taking the drug that you're taking. Are you following what is required for you to do like how are you going at it, are you just focusing on taking it just to deal with the symptoms. Or are you doing all the other things that's required of you. it's kind of like I remember some years ago, I think it was a it was a pharmacist for summer, if you get as a pharmacist and says when you take you know when you take world attack them the cough medicine. And they said what people don't know. Is that when you take your world attaching the cough medicine, you need to drink water behind it."
3581.0,Patient,Oh.
207.0,Provider,"And he said I forgot how he explained, he said it's something about you drinking the water that releases or something that, in addition to taking it like you're just taking this concentrated, but you. You pretty much need to take water so every time, like, I take the role to test them. I drink water behind it, because he said it's the full something that it does to the medication or whatever it does so, then we both take the Rover test them why does it work faster for me than it does for you, because i'm taking this. Additional that. Right i'm taking this additional step and so now that you're you're now going in to a row you're stepping into the role where you're now being. The person that sits in the seat now you're the leader in comparison to the patient, yes, you have some idea, yes, you have some experience and no you're not going there to make it all about you to share your story. Because one of the things that you learn. You only share something personal about you unless it's going to be relevant to whatever it is that you're talking about, because if you don't if you don't watch it then it becomes more about you. than right becomes about you, helping them and so now that you stepping into this role you're going to have to work hard at. I need to observe and I need to understand what is the consistent thing or is everyone here, because this is the other thing you know when you're sitting in that role. When it comes down to the group dynamic. When we go into therapy we go into work with one person at a time. it's a lot when you're dealing with multiple people at a."
3581.0,Patient,Time.
207.0,Provider,"So you're having to watch you're having to monitor you're having to understand the group dynamic, are you at the beginning phase. What stage are you performing morning or joining, and all of these different stages of group What stage are you at and based on the stage that you're you're you're you're in with the group, it goes to show like one, what is the middle stage again."
3581.0,Patient,storming is it storming.
207.0,Provider,I don't think it.
3581.0,Patient,might be. Norman know arming forming storming.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, I think it's the normal it's the part where it's the group is called me said. This is where the group is cohesive, where everyone is getting along and we're sharing with each other and we're opening up and all of that it's the the call here I think it's the cohesion I think there's cohesion to I think that's the part and so. it's understanding, where you are, and I think when you sit in that group it's now you're you're reflecting on everything that you learn about group dynamics. understanding and knowing how to present yourself. And just constantly reminding yourself that I am the I am the leader or co LEADER I am the patient. Because you also have to be able to establish some boundaries. Right and those bouncer comes with a level of respect, because if I see you just another added cool us to me and thing."
3581.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly. And my job was my first one, but it was weird how all those feelings like came up, so I was like okay I gotta I really got to work on this because it's absolutely right. And i'm not one to self disclose I mean maybe if it will benefit my client maybe but that's very little information, I will give because I have it in my brain. This thing called judgment like I don't want to look and competent I don't want to look like you know, like oh this go on this and i'm not on this, how she got out, you know just like how you said, as she going to help me. it's just another addict so. yeah it was definitely an eye opener That was my first group, and it was just weird a weird."
207.0,Provider,"And you're going to the feeling the feeling of in competency that's naturally you're going to feel that you're going to admin, no matter what stage you're always going to feel that I remember the first time I worked with a lawyer. Hello. Little did I know like oh whoa I was over here being overly critical of myself. And so. If you're you're always going to feel I don't measure up or."
3581.0,Patient,"I can, I have a once once you start hearing people's stories."
207.0,Provider,"that's something that you're going to have to work on for yourself anyway, no matter whether it be now in the beginning, once you get your job, where you're going to always feel that i'm. In terms of people judging you. That just this we all love judges out here okay. let's call a spade a spade, we offer judges, we all judge somebody. You like to go somewhere and you see somebody are you judging them you'll know diddly squat about. So this is what we do, naturally, in part and that's the reason why we, we always feel so sell you know not so common but we're always. Always under the fence like Oh, I wonder if there, people are going to judge me this is something that you're going to feel either way, so when you each time you sit in your room, and each time you go. normalize a lot of these emotions like this is normal it's something it's a work in progress i'm new, and so I am going to feel this way. i'm think about you, being a client and I think this was one of the things that you first said when we met it's like your own curiosity is, are you added to have do you have a history of addiction. Because, then you feel like only if you have a history only you would understand where i'm coming from. And to some degree, there is some truth to it. But does that mean only a person with a history can help you."
3581.0,Patient,"I get it, I am one that very well, did say that and believe you still believed all the time, like how did you say you know. What i'm going through, but do you. Know you're really what i'm going through right."
207.0,Provider,"And so, so so, even if I say you know what here Christina you know I I did I did some research and I did some things and I took some things i've heard some things that you don't even know. And so you still are going to come back at me and you're going to say but Rochelle you still don't understand. So, no matter what it is you're always going to feel in that moment the emotions that your experiences whatever is going on in your mind and you're always wants to feel that the other person don't understand."
3581.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,"You know you're always going to feel the other person don't understand you're always going to feel the other person don't understand what i'm going through, because at the end of the day, we always feel like we're an island. And I am on this island, on my own, and you have never been on an island, so you don't know. Right, so we all so that's why they say no man is gonna work, but we always feel that way, and so, because i've been on this island for so long and i've gone through these things you look at me, and I say look at you you've never been here you don't know what how you social. And even if. You have put in your head like you said, the only person that can help me is the person that has been on this. that's not necessarily true. So you have to be able to identify like you said, there are only those moments. Where if you share just a little and another reason why you only share just the little. In the right moment, and knowing when because you also have to maintain that boundary. Because now if it is me saying. boy Christina you remember, like when you told me that, like when you will we talked about your stuff you remember, like when you tell me about what you know and so now. i'm always going to relate everything and i'm always want to try to align myself with you to make us feel like we're wanting to spend. And this is where the breakdown of the boundaries, because now I no longer have this level of respect and that boundary has been crossed. Because now i'm always going to try to allow you can you know you you remember Christina what we used to hit that copy, you know how it is and where is the respect."
3581.0,Patient,"The professional line I feel like that professional relationship is not. i'm talking like you're my friend, you know, and I mean not not my professional yeah. I get it."
207.0,Provider,And everybody doesn't know how to to keep it that.
3581.0,Patient,Keep that line yeah.
207.0,Provider,"And so, sometimes it's very it's you, you have to know when to. When you sharing with it, what is the relevance of me telling you that you're in a domestic violent relationship, what is the result relevance for the most part of me telling you that I was once in a domestic violent relationship, I have to know the right time to say it. and wives reality of me telling you it."
3581.0,Patient,"benefits the client that's that's how we were taught that benefits the client, but I mean I feel like those situations are far and few in between. Exactly because it can do more damage than good."
207.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly, so I would recommend that on each time that you spend in a row, because right now you're you're you're not necessarily a Co facilitator you're just you just."
3581.0,Patient,settle just observing at this point yeah.
207.0,Provider,For how many how long. Before I would add.
3581.0,Patient,"So I think i've got one more week and then probably come like the first week in November, I will either start co facilitating or seeing clients, on my own."
207.0,Provider,"Oh honey you a student you got to see clients you better be prepared to go in there next weekend, you can make life on your own."
3581.0,Patient,"that's right i'm ready to i'm ready to just to see where my strengths and weaknesses are so i'm ready just to get that first one out of the way, because I know i'm going to be nervous about it, but after the first one, I should be good I should be good."
207.0,Provider,"Even if you've been doing it for a month, even if you've been shadowing for the month month, the first time. That you have to do it on your own yes you're going to be nervous and yet you're gonna be like oh my God I don't know that after the second or third then you'll come into yourself and you're like okay i'm fine, but I wouldn't, this is what I would recommend. Every time you go. Ask yourself okay what am I feeling now, and how can I work through it not get over it. Because what gives us strength is working through something working through those emotions working through those thoughts. working through when you are looking at the dynamic of everyone in the room, you trust me when I say you are going to be able to relate to, if not everyone will a few people in that room. you're going to be able to relate to them in their experiences, or whatever they decide to share on any given day you are going to be able to relate to them. If you do, how did you feel in that moment when that person share and how were you able to quickly revert back to being the professional and not the coin. Because if you're not able to go back to being a professional and you stay in you find that it brings up a whole lot It means that you know what there's something that I need to work on. Right there's a crash hurt or there's something that I for myself, I still need to work on, because if I don't if I keep avoiding it or if i'm in denial of something that means i'm not going to be any good to the people that I want to work with. One of the big issues. Especially the fact that when you went through your relationship issue, and you have your look up at that point. You will find someone in the room. That probably shares the same information and you won't put on your book or a girl girl."
3581.0,Patient,Let me tell you.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, yes you're going to feel like that you are going to there are times, where you will hear someone who share something and it just deck to you, and it makes you have a flashback of your own life. It is that it's more overwhelming and you find that in that moment you can't, then you say hey there are things that I need to work on, because you also have to think too there's a lot of people who go into this profession doing addiction counseling because of their own path. and find that they relax and then they call back into active addiction."
3581.0,Patient,Oh wow.
207.0,Provider,"there's a lot of people who do that they go back into active addiction, but it's identifying for you. I mean you would have to talk to them to know why, but you think about being in this role in counseling. you're going to hear people's stories all the time and it's going to remind you of your own life in your own path and unresolved trauma and unresolved emotions and things that you probably avoided, for a long time. In order for you to be effective, anyone that you work with you have to be able to identify within your phone. Is there some unresolved things that this individual reminded me. That I still need to work through it."
3581.0,Patient,"I didn't really think about that about people relaxing and. bringing up their trauma and how it will relate to my trauma and. The my site supervisor told me that she thinks every counselor and every therapist should have a counselor. And is there, outside of. Of."
207.0,Provider,"What, why do you think."
3581.0,Patient,Because of that right there because of that right there.
207.0,Provider,"You think think about the biggest trauma the most the biggest most recent trial because going to tell you sometimes. I don't know how would it, how would I went down, but you think about if you come to a session. And somebody is telling you. The same thing. But then they added a different caveat. to it. And if you haven't really fully worked through your trauma and you're hurt that you're still trying to work on hearing this. You will make the mistake and go home and then you start giving your husband, the business and he looks like all I said was hi honey, how was your day. Because, because a lot of time we take a whole. Other people's problems. So that's the reason why, yes, we do have to you, I have a friend of mine who I said honey i'm just letting you know you are my unofficial therapists Okay, and I need event, right now, you need to help me see this. In and address the reason why, because sometimes you hear things from other people, or it is that you have. Something that is relatable and you find especially like issues with your mom with your whatever it is you're going to hear a lot of familiar sport. Even in the group you're going to also hear a lot of people making excuses in terms of why they relax."
3581.0,Patient,Okay.
207.0,Provider,"you're now you're in this seat you're going to start hearing it just sounds like an excuse that sounds like a nothing. It is, and then, when you have to find a way, not to say it bluntly, like you know that just sounds like an excuse, and then they're going to send it on to oh you judge me now you have to come back."
3581.0,Patient,Like a longer you know you lion what happen.
207.0,Provider,"So if I would recommend and encourage that when you fit in, whether it be groups or when you're now that you're in your field of your practical. it's working on. After you're finished, if you are able to identify hey you know what this reminded me of something that I thought I had worked through but I haven't. And how can I work through this. On my own I need to do a mental check and emotional check how do I work in her what am I, avoiding. What exactly it is the undoing okay. So I would recommend that you, you continue doing that, but i'm excited for you."
3581.0,Patient,to thank you i'm so excited.
207.0,Provider,"enjoy all of it, because it means that the. Real deal is almost there."
3581.0,Patient,it's getting closer I can't wait.
207.0,Provider,"yeah hold on, let me, let me give you another. Sure, let me go here."
3581.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"At the same time. i'm trying to open up my calendar and i'm having a hard time, so if I need to change the Puerto Rican are texting, but you know, but right now, they tend to 17th at this time okay. Okay, and have you how's everything with gluten all."
3581.0,Patient,Good everything's going good.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and you're able to get back on your normal. Regiment with medication and no."
3581.0,Patient,doctor still hasn't put me on monthly yet so I don't know.
207.0,Provider,When do you meet with her individual.
3581.0,Patient,I think next month.
207.0,Provider,You met with her this month already.
3581.0,Patient,"Know she's only having me come in, like as needed, so I usually wait for her to be like Okay, you need an appointment and then i'm like."
207.0,Provider,Okay um maybe if you can.
3581.0,Patient,i'm sorry about that.
207.0,Provider,yeah I asked her if. you're able to go to.
