121.0,Provider,how's everything else going since you've been back.
14121.0,Patient,Oh pretty good just kind of come up with words feeling overwhelmed with that. i'm. Just a lot going on right now with my. team and the girl left and so hurt somebody else and she's internal so she won't start for a couple weeks and it's going to be kind of crazy.
121.0,Provider,yeah and you'll have individual reports.
14121.0,Patient,"Oh, I just I just been feeling like overwhelmed by like everything. yeah and."
121.0,Provider,Open with that. How are you what are you doing to cope without.
14121.0,Patient,"I don't know I mean I I needed this vacation I think I just needed the break I mean I did like work a little bit because my friends had to work while I was there some but. I didn't do this but there's to me. I need to I need to work more that's just that's it I need to put in some more hours at work. Because i'm not. been tracking my emails like I you know I try to make it to do list I like I like to write on paper. You know I mean, I have to have paper and then. Then I feel like my my list get lost, and then I have to rewrite them and whatever, and so I started doing one on an excel spreadsheet and this I feel like I don't get anything done, you know what I mean and so i've been tracking my number of emails and it's like. Yesterday, when I left to come to group I had 620 emails. I logged in and I had 634 so somehow overnight I got 1414 emails and it's like oh. And I like I. mean I had it down to like 576 a couple of days ago and."
121.0,Provider,yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"See, I feel like that's all I do is read emails and I can't necessarily take care of them right away so then i'm like Okay, I try to prioritize and one time, like a couple months ago I literally took all the emails in my box and shifted them to a different folder like. like an action folder so that the folder i'm looking at all the time isn't so overwhelming, and I might need to do that again I don't know if."
121.0,Provider,I was that helpful.
14121.0,Patient,"Your was but there's still emails in there, that I never addressed, and obviously they didn't weren't that important or somebody beyond me, you know. But I know I need to like need to be more responsive to people in the. In the moment because I know that my manager really looks at that yesterday we had a meeting, and we have to. log notes about ourselves all year long in this program and then it's used for annual reviews and. We can have like underperforming performing or outperforming and the new you're raised everyone gets 3% as long as you're performing. And if you're out performing you get like an extra 2% or whatever, so people have to really brag about themselves, and you know that kind of thing so yesterday we had a meeting of with my manager and the other supervisors and. They want they wanted to know who we thought our out performers were for that we were going to try to. Because in January, they have some kind of. Collaboration calibration they call it we're all the supervisors get together and they talk about their own performers and to make sure that, like. Other people agree that my output former former and i've never been involved with it, this will be my first time but. it's like there's so much to it, you know logging all these comments about people, and this is what I didn't want to do that's where I tried to like. do everything, but this part you know what I mean and that they're paying me as this role, and I, you know it's just it's very challenging to to manage my time effectively and. With. With the group and everything it's it's just. Throwing me off, I can't I don't I just need to. be saying i'm lazy well, I know I just need breast and you know time like that, but I need to like spend a couple hours a day on the weekends just. On on work and catching up a little bit, and I know that will help me. feel better about things you know, like tonight, I am the late supervisor so right now i'm working at home, but i'm to go into the office and. I have to stay till five and make sure that all the clients and everybody's out of the building and I have to stay that happened to me one time that group I hit. I was late supervisor and there was a client that stuck around, so I I couldn't join the group I tried to but it wasn't a very private setting. Is the first half but. And we have to sign up for this and i'm careful to sign up on Wednesdays and Fridays. I switched with somebody you know, it was a there was only one time, but so tonight i'm just kind of looking forward to not having to rush I feel like i'm rushing around all the time, like. hurry up and get home, he said, I want to sit at work in my office and do group, because I don't I don't like that. i'd rather and it just feel like i'm in then. I have a different vehicle than I did last year and it doesn't have auto start, which I know this is first. If I didn't have auto start it wouldn't be the end of the world, and I would just live with it, but. I had bought my daughter an auto start for her car like when she started driving because she worked at fleet farm and. She had a walk like across the street and down the block to get to her car and she'd worked till nine o'clock at night and I didn't like that, so I wanted to have her to have this nice car starter so she could tell us the car started and so. A lot of money, I mean, I think I even bought it like on Black Friday, but it was like $600 by the time you get all installed and. After she passed away, we gave the car to my niece who drove it for like. Four years and then she decided to get a different car, so we got the car back and my son drove it to college for a while, until the engine blew up and then we put my mom just she loved this car, because it was my dad's she was like obsessed with it. and So anyways we've replaced the engine and then a bunch of other stuff went wrong and finally jumped it, but I had my son take the auto start out of it, because they had told me that I can put in a different car sometime so I had that installed yesterday."
121.0,Provider,Okay.
14121.0,Patient,"The only cost me like $239 versus you know 600. So I had to run around, and you know have my mom follow me over there and then. I just feel like i'm doing this running running running, like all the time. So it's just frustrating, I guess, and. I didn't prioritize my eating, while I was gone so i'm really focused on that now and. login that and. um. I don't know if rhonda told you, but kind of had decided to check into like a weight loss surgery program did she tell you. yeah just because I wanted to see what it was about and. And is just like the diet suddenly a diet, but you know they only want you to eat three times a day three meals and whatever and. sounds like a lot. And I don't know if I really want to do it, but I just I don't know and she she said she she was sensing some kind of desperation and that's sort of how I feel and i've been honest about that, like I don't want to be the size, the whole rest of my life."
121.0,Provider,"I don't think weight loss or grief, the answer to that."
14121.0,Patient,"Well that's what she kind of said, and you know I know that i'm. mean i've tried all these diets and I know that. Restricting isn't it helped me and all that stuff and. I just. I don't know. Just like I am sick of. My bladder issues i'm sick of. my stomach being in the way when I bend over and put my shoes on i'm just tired of it all. And I just feel like. You know, originally I joined this program not you know, thinking that and you need to become i'm. Obviously, in tune with my emotions and why. or eaten benji and all that stuff and then it would kind of go hand in hand with me losing weight and then you know we've talked about that. that's not really my goal in this program and I get it, I understand and."
121.0,Provider,"it's not the goal, but it will happen."
14121.0,Patient,Once i'm. I mean. Once i'm not over me once I figure out why i'm over eating and. yeah. I get it i'm just feeling.
121.0,Provider,Because the thing is with the weight loss surgery. it's still haven't figured out while you're reading or how to control that. it's not going to do you any good you're still going to do the same things. And you're going to have more problems because you have all sorts of absorption issues with that there are all sorts of complications that come around with that in ways that it impacts you psychologically to.
14121.0,Patient,"You do you know people I mean, I know that renee had weight loss surgery like years and years and years ago and she said that she never she didn't regret it, she said then group before. i'm. I don't I mean I know other people that have had surgery and. I watch them get all skinny and they were just too thin and then it seemed like they would gain like 20 pounds back, and then they they looked really good and healthy, you know what I mean and but then I know I know that other people have gained weight back and. I know it's not. A cure I know it's not, but I just. it's like I don't know what to do with myself. I feel I just feel I don't know how to make myself happy I guess know what I mean and I told you that I. got that Mon, and I paid off, two credit cards and that felt really good and then my best friend actually works for a mortgage company that's although all across the United States, and so, when I was visiting her we've talked about it before. When I got divorced, which my divorce has been final I think for three years and, after two year, I had two years I was supposed to. After two years I was supposed to refinance the House and just have it in my name well I couldn't really do that because my ex husband kept be late on this. loan payment that my name is on but he's responsible for, and then you know back before I asked him to move out, he was 30 days late on one of our House payments and credit was just mess up for so long and i've been working so hard on that and. In talking to my friend about it and so anyway, she suggested that I fill out an application through their company to finance and. Based so that's what i'm doing I did it i'm approved and it like the interest rate is the same, but I have pmi private mortgage insurance, because you have to have that until. Like you have 80% equity in your House 20% equity in your House, or something like that I don't know and so like that's costing me $180 a month or whatever and. So, and so i'm taking out a little bit extra money to pay off that loan that I just took out for those two credit cards. And the other payment that i've been making on these doors that we had installed in our House that were very expensive and I totally regret, but. it's done and that's like $158 a month, so i'll be saving like $134 on the House payment only, but at the same time i'm taking out extra to pay off those other things. Plus $5,000 to do some repairs around my house that I need to have done, and then with those loans paid off, I will i'll have like $475 extra a month. So. Part of me should be, and I am happy that i'm at this point and i've worked so hard to get here. And I feel good about it obviously but. No, I this at all, I feel like I don't have anyone to share that with my life and. I don't know I just. don't know how to make myself happy be honest."
121.0,Provider,"um well, I think one thing that I noticed was the week that you were reaching out to more people you seemed a lot happier. I think that's something that's really important for you is to keep building those connections."
14121.0,Patient,yeah I agree.
121.0,Provider,Because I mean if all you're doing is work therapy. and cleaning your House and something yeah who wouldn't be happy with that you've got to have more.
14121.0,Patient,yeah.
121.0,Provider,And I think social connection for you is really important.
14121.0,Patient,"thought about that yesterday, as I was making my my list of my gifts to myself. i'm i've come up with 28 things I just like last night I was on 2022 or 23 and. I thought I don't have to rush and figure out the last three I can kind of you know, so today my son got up this morning and. He saw he came my room out like 515 this morning and said kind of with you until 545 so he signs in my bed and cuddled with me I love it when he does that just you know. All the sudden he got a text from his boss, because it and around a little bit and then froze he said it's slippery out. Take the day off and so of course he gave me a hobby went back to bed, but I told him about the list of the gifts to myself in December. And I say that today he's giving me a gift because he's going to clean up the kitchen and the look the big mess, the dogs made in the living room with the stuffed animals and he laughed at so okay mom. So that's today's gift. They do that for me."
121.0,Provider,I like that.
14121.0,Patient,"And then you know i'm struggling because we, when we left when I left on my trip I just basically transfer him the money, I would have spent in groceries and said. you're on your own well, of course, you're buying groceries you just did whatever eight with my mom and stuff so I did a grocery or her last night, and you know RON and I had talked about you can hear I have. enough food to bring to work for lunch and snacks and whatever so nice restocked up on those types of things and I was really surprised because. I tried to have you know Jared likes Gilbert which I know is probably not the most healthy yogurt but at least some yogurt. And he'll eat apples, so I always do up my grocery list, and then I asked him his thoughts and he said he wanted so shocked wanted plain vanilla yogurt and some granola to put in it. was, like you, like granola I mean I had no idea so yeah we'll put some of that on our grocery order so."
121.0,Provider,that's a good breakfast to.
14121.0,Patient,yeah so I was just shocked.
121.0,Provider,"I, I am not something about yogurt the texture of it, I just like it it's not my thing, but if I can put like granola and freedom and I won't."
14121.0,Patient,"You know what I used to do when I way back when I was in weight watchers yeah 100 years ago um they told you to put like rice krispies in your yogurt and stir it up and then it and I haven't done that, for a long time, but like snap crackle and pop, you know as you're. done in it just gave it some some substance, I kind of forgot about that, but. yeah he pointed out that the yogurt that has m&ms in it and i'm like yeah that's not healthy. We should you know and then he mentioned the granola happy."
121.0,Provider,funny. m&ms that up.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah Oh, and then I did put on my list um see, I have, I have go to a movie I love to go to movies so i'll probably go with my mom and then. Go out for a drink with someone go out for coffee with someone again and then. So the supervisors, that I work with that work I don't really know them very well they've all worked together for many years, but one of them offered to get tickets to a play the else else the musical and remember. I don't like musicals they make me just want to throw up but I said sure i'll go, it was like $18 and she got. You know it's just something to do and hang out with them, we did like a team outing on the day and the anniversary of my daughter's passing we went out. roots thing and we had lunch it's always nice to get to know them a little bit more so that's The other thing i'm going to the Elf play I think it's a musical is awesome music think."
121.0,Provider,The movie is not but I guess they made it into a group of musical.
14121.0,Patient,"i'd have to look at the ticket, I have the ticket but."
121.0,Provider,"i'm pretty sure it is, I think i've seen."
14121.0,Patient,"it's something to do and it happened to be on a Wednesday when I didn't have group, so I went for it."
121.0,Provider,"You know, if nothing else you're at least out you're doing something different, and you're spending time with people."
14121.0,Patient,"yeah exactly that's why I thought Okay, even though it's a barfing musical maybe i'll like it."
121.0,Provider,Have you seen the movie oh.
14121.0,Patient,yeah it's hilarious.
121.0,Provider,yeah so it can't be that bad.
14121.0,Patient,"I hope not, I went to my niece was in musicals and she's as a beautiful singing voice, and she did a Mary poppins. And I went to it, and that was like torture."
121.0,Provider,Why don't you just like useful so much I.
14121.0,Patient,"don't know, like the high pitched singing and i'm interested in the play parts, you know all of a sudden it same with a movie like even like the lion King okay it's so good, and then all of a sudden, they have to stop and sing a song. I don't know I don't know what it is."
121.0,Provider,Your personal video just cracks me up.
14121.0,Patient,I know it's funny.
121.0,Provider,that's like the thing that gets.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah like I went to footloose once and I thought Oh, this is going to be fabulous and it was, like all was was singing and. No just doesn't i'm not i'm not interested in it, for some reason but i'll do it just to get out of the House, I guess, and maybe it'll be good I don't know we'll see. Like i've not seen like mamma MIA and though i'm just not interested in that at all."
121.0,Provider,"look like to me it's like feel good like I want it, but that's not your thing that's cool."
14121.0,Patient,Right and we're.
121.0,Provider,yeah we're all we're Darren ways. So it sounds like you've got some good things on your list.
14121.0,Patient,"I do, I do."
121.0,Provider,So I think definitely falling through those. can be really important for you.
14121.0,Patient,"Oh, that was a good, a good thing that you came up with."
121.0,Provider,"I, I have to tell you I was pretty proud of myself and I got all excited told Andrea and she got all excited roles yeah that's a good one. I like algorithm I do some work out. But it is really important, like we've got to. Take care of ourselves, no one else is going to like we have to prioritize. And when we do we do start feeling better because we're actually taking an interest and valuing ourselves and taking care of ourselves. And spending some time on ourselves, which sometimes feels like I don't have time to do this but, honestly, if you're not taking care of yourself, nothing else is going to work out well. So I think it's really important to be intentional about."
14121.0,Patient,"Right and we always say Oh well, take a bath well sure I can do that, but I don't."
121.0,Provider,"i'd rather get a better future, to serve her one as."
14121.0,Patient,"Well, and, and this is, I don't know I love taking a bath and at so we lived in the same House for like 11 years. Not not where I live, now, but in a different house and I started out there, with just my two kids and then after a few years, I met my husband and he moved in and he got a wild hair up a spot that we needed to make the bathroom bigger. So my son's room was right next to it, so we made his room like a foot smaller and made the bathroom bigger and anyways it we we got a new bath tub and I bought one of those that's really deep. You know, and it was it was i'm so glad I had done that, because my daughter was sick she loved just soak in the tub mean that was like her thing she. won't take a bath you know and even my son, you know when you're sick i'd say well let's why don't you take a bath i'll make you a bath and we just always made everybody feel better well now that i've gained you know. 50 pounds, you know. The bathtub seems so small. Like it and it's not very deep, and so I don't know i've even know i've set a set aside some i'm going to set aside some money for some remodeling projects and. Maybe I invest in a new bathtub a deeper one I don't know I don't know how expensive. That could be i'd have to pay somebody to do it, but that's something that I really like then maybe that's something that's worth doing. Man do a lot of stuff around my house I just need to like. Finish a couple of windows that my husband started before he moved to replace some windows, but didn't do the trim and you can see the concrete lock and stuff. And then I need to have some. Like his dad hung up our curtain rods, and he didn't do it right so they've fallen down like 14 times and there's holes in the walls and it's just like those types of things, but. Either I need to learn how to do it myself or I need to pay somebody to do it. And you know, maybe I pay my son to help me I don't know we'll see what happens, but I need to just get this loan done and i'll have some decisions, making money i'm going to need a new washing machine too so. But you know I just I think that would make me really happy to have a nicer bathtub. yeah."
121.0,Provider,"You know it's funny the things that make us happy, but if we have something like that, then I am all about if you can afford it, making it work. Because life's too short to not. buy anything things you enjoy and be able to do."
14121.0,Patient,"Right exactly. So I have to redo the whole bathroom it's just the top. Well thing or whatever so. i'll check into it, I know that they like menard says, you know they have sales all the time and. especially after the first of the year, when people don't have any money. Like that's when they're they do their big sales because they need to keep getting their revenue. So. I will keep thinking about that."
121.0,Provider,that's a good plan.
14121.0,Patient,So what do you like to tell me more about the weight loss thing and how what you've seen other people's experiences be if you don't mind.
121.0,Provider,We have a lot of patients. That have had weight loss surgery and end up coming to us because of.
14121.0,Patient,"Really, after the fact. Because they've gained the weight back."
121.0,Provider,"Either they've gained weight back or they've developed. An eating disorder because of it, or they. Use depending what kind of surgery, so that, like you can only keep down certain like amount of food anything over that they would throw up and then that started coming a pattern forum. Oh, so all sorts of different shoes."
14121.0,Patient,"Okay, so you would not recommend it."
121.0,Provider,"don't lie just make that very clear, though. I get the feeling desperate. And I really think that if you continue to address the underlying stuff. you're going to be a lot happier and your body is going to get very sweet or wants to be."
14121.0,Patient,"What do you find like um. I don't I don't i'm not talking about like the diet mentality, but. People kind of you know. figure this all out and. Do they. What do they do to to lose weight, then."
121.0,Provider,"Honestly, if you start being intuitive your body's going to adjust."
14121.0,Patient,Okay.
121.0,Provider,"You don't have to do anything like crazy or tree. let's be your hunger and fullness. engage in some joyful move. Which is the cheesiest phrase ever and I swore I would never use it, and now it comes out of my mouth all the time. In engaging exercises that you enjoy not exercise for weight loss or exercise for punishment, but doing things that you actually enjoy doing. Like I think i've shared this with you, I love rolling."
14121.0,Patient,rolling.
121.0,Provider,"mm hmm we have. I have a robust literally right in front of me right now. This is Eric fit in this office so that's where it is. But that in boxing I love they don't feel like exercise to me they're just fun. they're great workouts. But I do it because I. mm hmm it makes my body feel good. I have been doing. Not I do it, so I can count the calories or anything else."
14121.0,Patient,I really use enjoy like. When I was. I was married so and I got married when I was 20 but so it would have been in my early 20s but my mom and I used to go to the ymca and they had like. Step aerobics. Like where you have one of those. Steps step up and down and isolate that they'll do that anymore.
121.0,Provider,"No, but actually that's something that I really enjoy too, and I got one of the blogs on Amazon. And there are a ton of YouTube videos. Oh for separates so if that's something you're interested in it's not that videos are free, the blocks, not that expensive."
14121.0,Patient,Like the stepping thing you mean.
121.0,Provider,"Do not, however, put it on a hardwood floor."
14121.0,Patient,Right.
121.0,Provider,Because I did that and it slid as I was stepping one day.
14121.0,Patient,Oh no and you almost broke your legs.
121.0,Provider,My head I backwards in every.
14121.0,Patient,Oh.
121.0,Provider,So put a map or something.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah so like I have a we. Go. I haven't used it a long time, I mean. Those have little stepping things like the we fit or whatever well. Since I moved to this House, I don't have you can't put on car doesn't work on carpet it doesn't register your steps, or whatever, and so I tried putting like a board on the floor and I didn't really work, and I know I need to play or I needed to play around with it more than I did but. I used to be kind of fun they had like the hula hooping one. Doing I don't know who's just more goofy then. yeah and fun then Eric seemed like exercise. Absolutely so maybe I can figure out a place of drag that to. Go I did I did enjoy that do we have competitions, you know, like during and. After Jared so dear my son's girlfriend has had a lot of issues in the last six months. You know, between her dad. mentally you know she's realized that. He wasn't good you know he's just not a good person and whatever and she doesn't want to be involved with him and that's her thing and um. She went to like a hospital for like a week got some help with all of that, and then. If she hadn't. used her her arms were numb and just all kinds of things she has like this thing in her head where scala isn't big enough for her brain I don't know exactly but. So before having surgery they've tried, like everything else so long story short, she hasn't been driving because she hasn't been comfortable. And so now she's on some different medicine and she's going to physical therapy and all kinds of things so she feels better and so she's going to drive here on Saturday it's my son's birthday is tomorrow he'll be 20. And so we're going to celebrate on Saturday, when she comes. I think she would like that the we I don't know if she's ever used one I think she would get a kick out of that so maybe i'll see if I can drag it out this weekend and we can have some fun with it."
121.0,Provider,yeah I mean I hate anything like that it's just fun and. you're moving you're doing stuff.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah so. I don't know i'm. And now I mean I think i'd rather just continue with this program then do the surgery, but it was just something that I needed to check into I think probably for myself and. I don't know."
121.0,Provider,I get that.
14121.0,Patient,"Right, I met with someone on Monday morning and. As I was looking at it it's like this just seems like a lot of work to like you know, let it all they want you to like. Slowly SIP on waters SIP water all day long because when you after surgery you can't guzzle water or you can't drink too much water and can't drink water with your meals, because it will flush all your food through right away and."
121.0,Provider,it's like.
14121.0,Patient,"I have to drink something with my meals, or it gets stuck in my throat. In I don't know as as they were telling me all this stuff it was like wow that just seems like. I say a lot of work, I just mean a lot, I mean a lot of like adjusting. That maybe I I wouldn't like and, at the time I was thinking of like a lap band which isn't permanent well this place in here in my area doesn't do lap bands anymore, because people had so many problems with those. Like slipping or eroding the stomach and all kinds of stuff so then that wasn't a choice anymore, you know what I mean non permanent thing. So I was kind of surprised by that to. Which kind of made. You know rethink the. permanency of it."
121.0,Provider,I didn't tell you I know far more people that were credit. Then I know and all that are glad they did it. I can think like one person that I know that was lovely. And I can name probably plenty.
14121.0,Patient,"Okay. I mean I just I know that renee said she doesn't regret it, and I haven't talked to her about it specifically I just know that she had said that."
121.0,Provider,"But also, where did you meet her. Really."
14121.0,Patient,"great and so when you said, the vomiting part I was like I wonder if that happened to her and I get that you can't tell me that, but she has said that you know she does the purging and. I want nothing to do with that, I mean i'm thankful that I don't do that I can't imagine. Having to overcome that, as well as just indeed. yeah that would be hard. So you know, but then you know you meet with these people and then she's like oh yeah a lot of people say you know they wish they would have done it sooner thing and."
121.0,Provider,I think you got to remember their business too.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah they are. But you know they did say so, with my insurance, she said that there used to be like I had to do. Their eating plan or whatever for six months, meaning only three meals, a day and no snacking or whatever, and then. And that used to be a six month requirement, but they loosen that up and said that it's up to the facility to determine when the patient is ready for the surgery so she said it could be four months, it could be eight months, some people need longer whatever and. So I was like that was disappointing for me, too, because I thought again that's the the desperation part I think too it's like. I just I don't know I need to run to the bathroom."
121.0,Provider,Before. Oh yeah yeah. at all.
14121.0,Patient,"I think so. I kind of got messed up on my vacation taking it. So I sometimes i've only taken at once a day, but I think I do think it's helping. So yeah, especially on a road trip. I didn't have any issues."
121.0,Provider,"that's great. That was big. So what goals, do you want to be working on right now."
14121.0,Patient,"I. didn't do it last night, but I need to start doing that journal dump writing in the journal at nighttime thing so. kind of obsessed with journals like I need to have a cute one, and you know it's like. I also I will not Amazon, and I look I looked at a few when I just didn't order any but that's one of my things on my list is to order or if I I could make me run the target tonight and see what they have to but. Then I have a few that I can write in for. Listening I had this one, where I. was using it, when I was involved with josh, and so I kind of said okay i'm done with this so i'm not going to use look anymore, but every once in a while, if I have. thoughts about things like that I grab that book and I write in it, you know, so you always think I always think of journaling is having to be like chronological order you know what I mean but it's like that's my mood. So i'm going to do, but. Like. For a lot for a while, so i've been at my job, like four and a half years and. ice, I wanted to work somewhere else, because I was working at home, and I was sad my daughter died and it's like she. learned my background to say things, and you can see, this butter."
121.0,Provider,"Well, I see trees."
14121.0,Patient,"We have a little bit of snow out there kind of melted but. Jackie. So when she after she died um you know she always went on, she was a big Facebook or she loved to take selfies and she's always posting things to other people and things like that, and so. um when I first started my job I maybe people thought I was weird but I didn't care, I would like email myself things that. I was thinking about that day, and I would print them and I had this wall in front of me, and I would hang them on this wall. And it's kind of like odd, but like this, this is an example that I had on my board. With something my daughter wrote, she said she was with me on my son and she said I it was she was in North Dakota so she must be visiting her family. I miss my mama i'm definitely I definitely am in need of some quality time with her and my little brother. So that pops up in my Facebook memories and I emailed that to myself and I hundred on the wall, you know what I mean, so I could look at these little things and like this is, we took some funny pictures of hospital. she's like bald and we it was black and white, and we made our eyes really dark so we look like vampires. and We just goofy like that you know, and so I had you know I don't think I had this on my wall but anyway, so I when I moved into my new article actually wasn't even before before that I decided that I needed to take those things off the wall like I could. read them, but I was no longer going to print them and hang on the wall and that wasn't the main focus, so I started taking them off the wall and putting them in my book and. taking them down and. So that was I guess part of my healing, I guess, but then I I did I caught, some of them I couldn't take down some of my favorites, and so I did move them to my new office but anyway so. i've just been. Doing my thoughts in my book and. kind of my all encompassing everything."
121.0,Provider,That.
14121.0,Patient,"I definitely need to journal. don't or does the journal more. Like my friend and I that the one that moved away, we would have like. sort of like just we would tell each other, our random thoughts throughout the day like and then, when she moved away, I was so devastated that. I kind of felt like I needed to like you know, since I kind of quit doing that, and so I started doing it in my Journal in my journal I just my random thoughts, and so I think I need to keep doing that, too, because. Once you write it down, I can like. not focus on it anymore nothing."
121.0,Provider,"So how many days, this week, do you want to try to do that."
14121.0,Patient,"um. I mean every day I shouldn't do it every day. I think it makes me feel better. And I you know I talked with rhonda and. For sure, but you know be logging my three meals I just need to get back into a routine about that."
121.0,Provider,Making sure you're eating breakfast.
14121.0,Patient,"We talked about you know, the fact that I needed to get some groceries which I did do an order and i'm getting those tonight I bought like some protein bars, so I can have those at work like Connor like yesterday I. Had a bunch of meetings in the morning, so I just worked at home and then. No wasn't yesterday was Monday and then I went to work well, I was kind of hungry, and so I thought i'm going to stopping it the South is taco salad that I like did that will then it was like. You know salad takes a long time to eat and I had so much going on, that I didn't even start eating it until like 330 and I got it did up at like 1130. It was like. I just need like I need to go back to my sandwiches that I that you know, like, if I had something easier to eat, I would have just probably sparked account in between things I was doing. But because it was a salad it took longer so I have to keep that in mind too, and so I that's why I bought like they bought the favorite bread that I like. Cheese laces and. To make sure that i'm so The other thing is so I had surgery on my foot in it was like may I had like this cyst underneath my ankle bone and it was it when I went to Florida in February, my whole foot swelled up and so anyways I ended up having it removed. And then they gave me like a handicap thing. We have this parking lot I had to park across the street and behind the jail so it's like a block and a half to get to my office, which is good for me to walk obviously. But with my foot, it was like her painful and they she didn't want me walking that much for a while and. So many ways i've been taking Bennett because it was through November 30 the handicap sticker so that expired now, so I have to go back to parking in BSP that was another reason why I wanted to get my remote start. And so, when I go to the office today i'm going to have to park. block and a half away, which will be good for me to walk and then. i'll keep that in mind too when i'm with my group, you know what I mean I can't leaving work at the last minute. Where we walk forever, but um I don't know why I told you that. I guess i've been a little nervous about that, just because. I thought was another thought for the weight loss surgery is my knees hurt all the time, my hips hurt and it's like if I. walk very far I just need to start doing it once I start doing it, you know i'll feel better, I know I will. And I just need to get that in my mind."
121.0,Provider,"Well now, you get to start. And I think to trying to do some of the stretches and stuff that you talked about dylan."
14121.0,Patient,"I know, oh and yeah my kids going to vacuum, the living room today to so i'm going to. Maybe do some stretching is what I was thinking. And yesterday well when we talked with Andrea yes."
121.0,Provider,yesterday.
14121.0,Patient,"db T group. And she goes through our goals and I hadn't been very good, while I was on vacation and stuff so I decided, I was going to eat and log three meals, a day at least focusing on eating. Every three hours, and then I said that I was going to use my exercise bike for 10 minutes four times this week. And journal don't my thoughts each night."
121.0,Provider,Nice.
