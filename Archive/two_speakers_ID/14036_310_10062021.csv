310.0,Provider,"All right, so no changes in your medicine. Any changes to your pharmacy."
14036.0,Patient,The know the one i've been going to recently is the one have consistently been going to and i'd like to keep that one because there.
310.0,Provider,"that's no problem with me. That sounds good. So then any honestly, I just want to pick up where we left off, are there any questions i'm pretty i'm pretty laid back. type of person if there's anything that you particularly need to or want to talk about I don't have a problem with that, if you feel like there is a time to discuss winning or increasing medications i'm always open to discussion as long as you are open to receiving my feedback okay."
14036.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
310.0,Provider,But i'm also the kind of person that hey if it's not broke when not gonna fix we just gonna leave it as is.
14036.0,Patient,"i'll. definitely have future plans for you know a lot of portions of my life. I don't intend on suboxone forever or really maybe anything except first or Tara for a really long period of time. Because I would like to have something like that in the inventory, for whenever I go back to school. And so I definitely intend on by the time I go back to school, which might be in the year or more range. But definitely within the next five years. i'd like to have something like that so within the next three or so years I do intend, on being pretty much everything and having you know my own tools."
310.0,Provider,"I, like those goals, so I just want to repeat that back to you so. Not just for the recording so i'm understanding within the next three to five years, your goals are to return to school. continue your strategic with a to address your ADHD help you focus and get through school, but in that three to five years, your goal is to wean off of the suboxone is that what i'm hearing. I think that's I think that's an awesome plan and i'm here to support that."
14036.0,Patient,I appreciate it.
310.0,Provider,"So, as far as refills you shouldn't need a refill on the strategic correct."
14036.0,Patient,"I have a one for yesterday, the last four weeks and it's only been two weeks."
310.0,Provider,"Okay now you do need just about some which is fine and beans grown, it says there's the two results on there so she you should be good on that as well. Okay, I know."
14036.0,Patient,on the phone. yeah I think you said I was talking to three times a day but i've only been taking it two times a day once in the morning and once a night and that's been working perfectly fine.
310.0,Provider,So you just keep me abreast of I mean it's not necessarily a controlled substance but keep me abreast as you get low and need a refill for that.
14036.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
310.0,Provider,"Alright, so what i'll be refilling for you today is i'm. The suboxone."
14036.0,Patient,"correct and I get that every other Friday. Just because the doctor Hoover notified me that you know, there are issues with not keeping a consistent schedule those kinds of prescription, then people get questioned and. need to be."
310.0,Provider,"Yes, it can be. It can get cumbersome."
14036.0,Patient,"was unfortunate because I mean I know people do I mean it's essentially trading one opiate for another, but at least there's a controlled environment in which you can actually like develop yourself, while you, you know get off of the mental aspects of the addiction."
310.0,Provider,"I mean and listen i'm originally from Louisiana also um so. it's it's part of that cultural of South Bible belt mentality, where people are not necessarily receptive of. understanding that addiction is a medical disorder."
14036.0,Patient,Right.
310.0,Provider,"it's not fighting demons no it's a medical disorder that needs to be treated like a medical disorder and i've actually. i've been trying to educate my colleagues other like family medicine other for er physicians. that the same way that someone walks in with a broken bone or cold or sinus problems and you talk to them and want to get them on medication and take care of them. That is the same approach I would love to see people that are coming to your doctor's appointments your er with addiction problems it's a medical disorder and we need to treat it as such. and things are changing. Its it can be slow, but people are starting to realize, because you know people aren't receptive until it hits home and addiction is starting to hit and knock on the door of a lot of homes, so I do foresee that there will be more change. It just may not come as quickly. As we would like it to."
14036.0,Patient,"write for sure i'm going to be my neighbor friend from the olden days we're talking about that actually just last night. he's no longer you know, in the depths of it all either they're talking about how we pretty much literally rewired the reward system in our brains and we got to like pretty much like physical therapy that back to where it was before we started any of that nonsense."
310.0,Provider,yeah and it's going to be a process and you just got to be open to going through this process and understand like it's a journey. i'm trying to make sure I still remember how to do this.
14036.0,Patient,willing to put in all the work necessary to get me back to where I need to be.
310.0,Provider,most definitely.
14036.0,Patient,Like your shirt to boozy ish.

14036.0,Patient,"I have a friend, I know I could give her one of those shirts."
310.0,Provider,"All right, so yeah it looks like your prescription for your suboxone everything went through any other questions for me."
14036.0,Patient,"Know man, we usually consult with the doctor themselves about when our next appointment should be just whenever."
