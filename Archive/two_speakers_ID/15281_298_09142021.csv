298.0,Provider,And I understand you want to go on suboxone Is that correct.
15281.0,Patient,yeah I need to get help.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, my name is chantel Escobar i'm a psychiatric nurse practitioner. You can call me shed tell. Good i'm i'm going to help you today, get some suboxone Have you ever tried suboxone."
15281.0,Patient,"I ended up with one off the street trying to get off of this I ended up with a bunch of my senate bathroom and it scared me I didn't know anything about it and I cut a little bit off that and I put it my mouth, and I think it's sent me into some kind of weird. withdrawals yeah so. I never back right after that."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, what is your drug of choice, what have you been using."
15281.0,Patient,i've been using oxycodone 30 milligram i'd been inner nasal and probably about four to five a day. But 150 150 280 milligrams a day.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
15281.0,Patient,that's a lot.
298.0,Provider,"I get it, so you need to go without. Any of the oxycodone any opioids for minimum 12 to 24 hours get yourself starting withdrawals before you take the suboxone how you take the suboxone you can cut your strips in half. Or did under your tongue. And let it completely dissolve and nothing in your mouth 15 minutes before or 15 minutes after after it is completely dissolved for like 15 minutes you can spit it all out, you can swallow it if you want, but it doesn't do anything in your stomach okay. um. I will give you three films a day how you divide that up that's a top dose because of your how much you're taking. Of opioids I think you need a top. down but getting on is the hardest part Okay, but just know the longer you wait to get started, without doing anything, the easier it is it can put you into precipitated withdrawals. And what that is is. Our medicine gets in the brain and it knocks the other opioid off of its receptor and it's a bully in the brain it takes over control. Well, in the process of that it can put you through withdrawals, but once you're on it. Then there's a lot more success with it's it's not going to give you the feeling of feeling high, but it will help with people use it for pain that are not addicts they use it for pain relief. It has something added to it called naloxone and that helps you stay away from any opioids because you do not want to use opioids and suboxone. right will make you."
