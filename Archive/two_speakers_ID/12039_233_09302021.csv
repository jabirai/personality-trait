12039.0,Patient,"know I need to. I need to set up an appointment with her, I have it, I guess, I could be texting or I should do."
233.0,Provider,"yeah you should give her a text and see about setting up an appointment that'd be great in your previous appointment with her, have you talked about Matthew."
12039.0,Patient,Oh here in there not. Not too much more like how I used to do it.
233.0,Provider,"yeah gotcha not so much about the current thing huh. yeah gotcha so let's take a look here, let me see really quick your lab work, because then one have you have you been able to get your blood work done and I forget."
12039.0,Patient,i'm I only did I didn't have to post to again I did when we first stopped.
233.0,Provider,yeah that's all i'm referring to yeah back from like May.
12039.0,Patient,Right yeah.
233.0,Provider,"yeah so let me just take a quick look as we're talking about this. To see and I don't remember anything standing out, but let me take a quick look."
12039.0,Patient,"we'll see what's coming up on negative, but when you first get it, it all it can show negative, you have to like keep getting tested and shit."
233.0,Provider,I don't have it that's not what i'm looking for. Your red blood cell count is normal so that's good. We did look at hepatitis C and it looks like that came back positive were you aware of that.
12039.0,Patient,yeah I got him a B and C.
233.0,Provider,"When we check for hepatitis a and you don't have that be I can't really doesn't look like you've got an active infection you're probably immune to it, but I can't tell you for sure on that, all I can say on the half feet part is that there is. It shows me that your body has fought against hepatitis B, but doesn't tell me if you actually have it right now, do you know that you actually have the hippie virus."
12039.0,Patient,"yeah because i'm That was when I went and got tested again and I got tested for everything all herpes like a whole blood off I don't know to be called book and then they came back that I had hepatitis A, B and C."
233.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're working with your primary doctors on that it's like."
12039.0,Patient,I have a primary doctor.
233.0,Provider,"Okay, so you need to get."
12039.0,Patient,Work six days a week.
233.0,Provider,"So here's the thing right that hepatitis C, if you do have it that's gonna make you pretty tired your body's always fighting an."
12039.0,Patient,infection.
233.0,Provider,"going to wear you down. And i'm pretty easy to treat. You get in with your doctors, it takes a little bit of time to get the work done, but you get in and get it treated you're going to have a whole lot more energy going forward. And also, if you don't get it treated. you're going to end up with cirrhosis of the liver and maybe even liver cancer. So boy I would tell you to as you're kind of getting methods all wrapped up in there with that energy level right if they have seeds drive in your energy down and you're using the math to bring your energy back up. and getting rid of the HEP C is a nice way to to naturally bring your energy level back. hmm you hear me."
12039.0,Patient,yeah yeah you're right. gotcha that's what I figured that that you know what I mean it's a number of things that is draining my energy.
233.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely and certainly you know suboxone is it can be a little tiring for some people also can be a little exhausting as we as people get good and they're bringing the level down, I mean you're already at a fairly low level. So I think that would have left to do with it for you yeah yeah so i'm guessing first of all, we need to get the suboxone Repo for you is that right."
12039.0,Patient,"yeah um it would help I mean I I. picked up my other refill so i've been making a stretch because I I knew when I missed the class. I better start stretching it out, you know."
233.0,Provider,"yeah gotcha so um do you have medication for today, then."
12039.0,Patient,yeah I do.
233.0,Provider,"Okay, so if I send it in for Friday Saturday Sunday Monday, four days worth to get you back to group on Monday would that work yeah."
12039.0,Patient,that's perfect.
233.0,Provider,"So i'll get that part sent in the so the medication to help out with Matthew is often more for people who are using it like daily. yeah right it helps out more with the cravings and that's not what I hear you using it for. The the medication it's called murtaza teen or rubber on and we all often use this medication to help out with sleep, too, so it actually makes people more tired. that's not the direction i'm here, and you wanting to go with it right. I mean i'm that would make things worse for you."
12039.0,Patient,"It would be good, after work, I mean because a lot of times I have trouble sleeping i'm up, I want to sleep so bad and and i'm up all night. And I don't I don't know if that's like. i'm just going to La right now I don't know if it's that or."
233.0,Provider,"yeah we don't we don't do people who have struggled with substance abuse really want pills or things to take care of stuff we don't do that with sleep. If you mess, with the fleet process, then it becomes really hard to recover and get good tweet tweet pills are not something that we use very often. Instead, we recommend staying off the TV and off the phone for two hours before bed time reading a boring book. Taking a warm shower drink some sleepy time tea right get your body ready for sleep avoid caffeine after like 12 noon and those soda no coffee in the afternoon or evening because that'll keep your body up also. So those are some of the things that we recommend to help you sleep better right not to build enough, the way to go right. Now yeah so from what i'm hearing with everything going on, I don't think and again it's murtaza pain medication is not a silver bullet it doesn't work nearly as well as the box and does and let. People are really heavily into addiction, it can be an added tool but I don't think it's going to be a great one for you, especially with what you're saying you're saying you're only using it once a month. And it's more to get energy and i'm going to suck energy out of you, by using this pill. yeah so I don't think it's a great choice for you. When I would encourage are the things that we talked about what you know you keep coming into group with to disable on the suboxone. What you get in with your primary or get a primary you can get the hepatitis C taken care of right, those are going to help out with your your energy level and then really work on the sleep they make work towards getting a good night's sleep so you've got that energy for the morning. And then talking with gwen during counseling about the. Matthews also what's happening there. So okay to you."
12039.0,Patient,yeah not away.
233.0,Provider,"Now alright sounds good let's go with that then okay. Okay i'm going to get your so i'm going to get your the suboxone Center i'm going to do that, right now. you're going to right now, after we hang up you're going to send a text off to Glenn to work on getting scheduled OK OK, and then working find that your are you in roswell is that what I thought. I don't know the primary care folks down there but work on getting a primary care doctor even trying to Google what's what's available for you and only that when you call a place always ask them if they take your insurance right that's an important step along the way. Right yeah so let's work this and see if we can get you doing better okay. Okay, all right Tyler anything else for you today."
12039.0,Patient,Oh no Sir that's it.
233.0,Provider,"All right, and it's good to talk with you i'm glad you could come in and I will see you on Monday. All right, and have a good one."
12039.0,Patient,"All right, you too."
233.0,Provider,"Right, depending on the patient, please bring in the medication and allergies and vital life from previously. Assessment opioid use disorder Matthews, hepatitis and in some insomnia, will continue with the current doses suboxone. For next one one film a day medication sent in for four days to get patient back to his regular group groups or Monday at 9am and patient commit to getting in with those groups and he's going to be in touch with his therapist when the about getting a therapy appointment scheduled. Next is Matthew. application has had a previous use disorder, but has reduced it down to monthly or let's please add in all his history that he talked about there. At this point I don't think that the mentality is going to be very beneficial be doing the math to. bring up to the energy level, which has been sucked down, and I believe we're targeting is just going to add to that problem and, potentially, stimulate his desire to use math more to bring things up. Next is hepatitis patients, he said he was tested and had hepatitis A, B and C, this is not reflected in the blood work that we had done back in May. It was noted that he had a hepatitis C antibody positive but I don't have a viral load, my concern is the hepatitis. could potentially be making him exhausted also and recommend that he connect with a primary care and roswell to get started on the process of getting that treated next is insomnia, has met you certainly could have decreased because reserved and making it harder for him to sleep. We went through sleep hygiene practices recommended against the the medication to help with we've been focusing mainly on three hygiene. All right. Treatment plan to support patient and the patient agree and invitations on the face, thank you."
