16122.0,Patient,hi good morning.
498.0,Provider,Good morning verify your name and date of birth and green.
16122.0,Patient,"Yes, Evan Rogers 817 89."
498.0,Provider,Thank you so much for that Evan are you doing today.
16122.0,Patient,i'm doing okay i'm definitely spin sleeping a lot better so.
498.0,Provider,that's good that's very good that was actually my first question how's it going.
16122.0,Patient,"um so uh so that it was going actually. kind of tough actually um but I, for the past week I last Sunday, I dislocated my knee on my morning block and so i've been out of work. Like you know, on doctor's orders like staff, my leg and everything I just got out of the brace on Sunday."
498.0,Provider,Okay.
16122.0,Patient,"bye tough, I mean like basically I I like even with sleeping better I mean that was like pretty much when I cut down on that so loft like you said you know could have done 25 milligrams. I started sleeping better had a lot less nightmares just you know stable to get up around a lot easier in the morning um but the issue is that i'm still having a lot of problems concentrating at work like. I basically have to like. Like drink, you know, like multiple energy drinks throughout the day just to like you know remember to like put on my name badge or like you know it doesn't make me hyper. It makes me just be able to you know focus like you know people to clock in on time, you know, out of intellect clocking out of lunch on time um you know stuff to this shirt Tara basically helped with like earlier this year."
498.0,Provider,yeah okay so yeah i'm currently on 60 milligrams of. How do you feel about going up to 80 to see a bump will give you some early. Still on like the middle of the range those.
16122.0,Patient,"The the issue I have with. With higher doses, this has been like a universal thing with with a surprise and Snr is is basically if I get above like the you know, a higher than the middle dose. I get night sweats really, really bad which disrupts my sleep. And the issue was that, like it was working really, really well at like you know my current dosage until. You know, a few months ago, and I, and I went up, I went up to 16 like earlier like in February, like I started in January, it was the first thing that doctor is a doctor was like yep you got ADHD let's put you on track here first in it and the low dose like was like a you know. Like life changing you know I could remember to like do the laundry without having to. You know, to think about it constantly and this was with poor sleep with the living with in an extremely abusive environment, this was in January of this year. And I literally would not have escaped and realize that my mom's hoarding disorder was you know, had taken over the House if not for this for Tara like you know, enabling me to like clean my room. and"
498.0,Provider,"I excuse me, I think that. I think that tapering it up to 80 is at least worth a try and let me explain why. Because you seem to be benefiting from both. The mood benefits and the attention focused and if it's not just that it's not just the attention and focus, but even more more prevalent than that it's the successes that you had with it early on. switching from switching from drug classes, is more so. For patients who don't receive any therapeutic benefit whatsoever, I think we we kind of talked about this last time."
16122.0,Patient,"yeah here's a like I i'm not receiving any benefit from Russia Tara at this point, I mean it's basically if I don't drink coffee i'm like at like how like basically at 65 milligrams which i've been taking you know it's been slowly losing its effectiveness over. The past few months. which has happened with basically every single ssri is in our right, you know that i've ever taken."
498.0,Provider,"But it sounds like just a few minutes ago you said that when you first started taking it you received some benefit to it with regard to attention and focus, despite the lack of sleep. And that continued since February and so now with it now being December you're looking at about a 10 month."
16122.0,Patient,"stretch, oh no, no, no, no, it hasn't been just December it started losing effectiveness like before I saw you. Okay, and I thought it was the sleep. thing but improving my sleep did nothing."
498.0,Provider,"The only issue with that Evan is that you first started meeting with me and at the begin end of October, beginning of November, and you reported to me that this retailer was providing some assistance, which is why we've continued with it. that's the class."
16122.0,Patient,"And it was it was like I that here's the thing I didn't. When I first started seeing you there was a lot going on, like, I was still in contact with my abusers, there is, you know, so I was like okay yeah there's your terrorists working everything and basically over like I would say, since like late October. It has definitely not been working, especially when, because I was factoring and like Oh, like my sleep is disrupted Oh, you know it, you know but i'm you know I had improved sleep and, if anything like you know. it's still really tough like I function better with coffee than I do, with the stroke Tara. that's not right."
498.0,Provider,"Oh, are you indicating that you want to taper off of this material altogether."
16122.0,Patient,"yeah I want to taper off stitcher altogether it's not too many good and the other thing is, I can get my primary care doctor to send you my liver tests, but they are not good. My liver enzymes have been consistently elevated."
498.0,Provider,yeah we've we've talked about your world i've discussed that with you also at our first visit about you're able to agency level and your aka phosphate levels.
16122.0,Patient,"yeah the the boss is still is still elevated and i'm still having an unexplainable very easy bruising. which I understand, can be a side effect of some of the so arise vanessa's arise, I don't know which one it is but. No, I improved well going down all the fun there's a loft so i'm assuming it's it's the trips to Tara and I know that i'm like I I did start having the easy bruising after going up to 60 milligrams."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so this isn't something that that causes difficulty with regard to liver function. This material is used much more cautiously with patients with cardiac underlying cardiac issues."
16122.0,Patient,"And you really like i've looked up the. thing it says, do not take if you have liberty issues."
498.0,Provider,"Well, I tell you what, if you are interested in tapering in you know cessation of this material it doesn't require any tapering. You do not have to continue with that moving forward the strategic. What what the i'll tell you my recommendation, and then you can tell me what what you kind of determine. Is the best route for you now, you know chime in to let you know, but if, if not if you're concerned about medication consumption and you've you know, had the support of. distress hero for a little while now, and I think it would be a good time, especially since you're not at work. To focus on skills in order to like continue with evolving and progression of the maintenance of your attention and focus. you're on the lowest of low doses, with the zoloft you indicated that you want to taper off of your answers that you want to discontinue usage of your Snr but you still want to continue to work with regard to meant managing your ADHD most efficient. When was the last time that you thought you'd be rappers."
16122.0,Patient,"um so it turns out that my therapist was actually not trauma trained at all. It was Ashley so i've spent like the last three weeks trying to like you know switch to somebody else, maybe in two weeks I don't know, like my time management by my awareness of time as bad so it's like it's like I last saw her."
498.0,Provider,"Well, that that after things isn't. That kind of."
16122.0,Patient,Like after things you know. it's so it's like I don't know I I already got I got switched to somebody else who is trauma training.
498.0,Provider,"looks like your last visit with Ashley was on December, the second."
16122.0,Patient,Okay yeah that sounds about right okay.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you have another visit scheduled with Ashley."
16122.0,Patient,"No, I am now scheduled with amanda. Okay, who is trauma trained on Friday, this coming Friday. I don't know what her last name is. I just just told scheduled with amanda I confirmed multiple times is trauma trained. That was a huge setback was finding out that Ashley was actually not trauma train she actually inadvertently gave me some really bad advice that stretched we helped a lot. With my parents she she is more much more well equipped to deal with like people like my parents who you know i've got to the point where they can admit they need help and. You know, need to you know make amends that kind of thing her whole thing was basically she told me, it was totally okay for me to take on way too much responsibility regarding their situation. and Luckily, like very, very Luckily, the government agencies that I called can't do anything. Because there's just no legal they basically cannot get consent to get inside the House. Again, if they had been able to not only what i'm not ever had the support to deal with the fallout, but like. It was just way too much stress, I mean I need to be focusing more in therapy on like. On trauma not say. here's the thing I have the organizational skills, I can't use them. I mean like right, I was literally."
498.0,Provider,Like therapy that's what the rp comes in it's to assist you with. The skills that you have and building on those skills in order to and.
16122.0,Patient,"here's the here's here's where we disagree okay I. can be really blunt with you. Okay. Okay, I I have been I am 32 years old. I have been trying since birth, basically, you know what I mean, but since like I was a kid like very little my ADHD basically presented with organizational issues. Like it was missed it was swept under the rug it was I was blamed as a bad kid I was told I was lazy I was told I just needed to work harder, I was. It was a nightmare for 32 years until I got diagnosed. Earlier this year, in January by a doctor who actually listened and actually you know treated me like a human being. Not saying you aren't i'm just saying like this was like the first doctor who you are the second, by the way, who like treated me like a human being, listen, you know it was like Okay, you know you tried therapy you've tried so you know, like let's try something else um. And I was not at things like I was actually working with a therapist at the time for like the biggest thing that kept coming up was how do I clean my room, how do I, like. Do laundry how do I keep track of stuff and their response was just use the schedule is usually scheduled i'm like I can't use the schedule. I can't figure out how to do it, I can't you know I put it down and i'm like where Am I scheduled Oh, you know it was I literally could not, and not just organizationally but I couldn't use any of the. You know the other skills until. The Secretary of health. And now, this your terror is not working anymore, and I know, based on my response to anything ssri anything was serotonin in it that if that boost serotonin even a little bit if I go above the you know low medium dose. i'm going to have night sweats and that's going to disrupt my sleep and everything I did want to say that the last time I took the I know you were concerned about insomnia that's a valid concern, and I am concerned about it, too, with the stimulants, would you be okay with. Switching me to be you know FDA recommended. You know. To to a stimulant and prescribing tries it down because the last time I took tries it own I was a living with my abusers, I was, like several years ago. I was living with my abusers, I was on completely different medication and you know yeah I was cranky in the mornings, but it didn't help my sleep, but I was also on you know, like five different meds at the time."
498.0,Provider,i'm not concerned with regard to travel down is. The nightmares that you've experienced previously.
16122.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,"Right and i'll be i'll be very, very frank with you because, like I said this is that space and time zone is a wonderful man in order to. assist with insomnia, and the issue with that is is that in some people, it also causes very vivid nightmares knowing your past knowing what you're continuing to work through. I wouldn't want to provide you with anything that could exacerbate your ability to experience nightmares you know, in addition to that. As a full a full blown stimulant to call some difficulty with regard to sleep. But it typically resolves the more you become acclimated with the medication. If a stimulant is the absolute direction that you want to go."
16122.0,Patient,It i've tried i've literally exhausted everything else.
498.0,Provider,"OK OK, I will I will, I do not want you to feel like one i'm not listening to you because i'm hearing you loud and clearly. To. it's not something that I feel like it's off the table it's just there's. For me in my practice. I like to make sure that we exhaust all other avenues before we go to that so. If you don't mind meeting with me there very soon again. I hope that you're not tired of meeting with me, because I do like checking in with you just to see how things are going frequent check ins means that we know what's working what's not working, a week and make changes that's what the space is about. We could start you out with a low dose. Just to see and without travel down to see if it even causes any difficulty with regards insomnia, however, I would like, for you to really engage in therapy. both individually and group therapy and it's not just a preference it's a requirement with with stimulus stimulus IV therapy, you have to be. In constant attendance with regard to individual therapy appointments group appointments a monthly urine drug screens and appointment with me it's a lot to take on, in addition to your work schedule. You continuing to do the work outside of right heart with regard to pulling together pulling your life together continuously in maintaining it because you let's just say that you're juggling a lot okay. So that's the direction that you feel like that we've we've got we've come to this point of inflection where there's a lot just kind of headwall the strategic has somewhat had a wall you're not interested in pursuing the wellbutrin route, then. We i'll be more than happy to. support you in that manner in order to see if there's any progress with regard to that, but you have to know that. prescriptions will be short. there'll be provided in a one to two week basis you'll have to present to group twice a month you'll also have to see a therapist twice a month, that is. A hard red line drawn in the sand, with regard to it when you miss appointments we won't support the stimulant or therapy because stimulated stimulated therapy stimulant therapy can be addictive. Even if it's not as supportive in the areas of focus and attention, and so we don't want to we don't want to nurture and cultivate one area, while we are not supporting another one. The intended area does that make sense."
16122.0,Patient,"yeah i'm like I said i'm I have no problem with with group therapy the issue, the only issue is right now. Like if I was in a group with you know if anybody in the group has a personality disorder. That would that's basically akin to asking you know someone who's been in armed combat to like you know hey want to go watch your friends die, you know that's basically it. Because both my parents have have some kind of personality disorder, I mean they're basically alcoholics or you know, or you know, without the drugs."
498.0,Provider,"All of them, this is the thing about that. You you can't you don't necessarily get to dictate what other people are dealing with in group. The purpose of group is for you to show up and be supported, wherever you are and that's kind of the collective."
16122.0,Patient,is okay I just do want to make it clear that you could actually be making my ptsd worse.
498.0,Provider,"If you're not that's not my intention. not my intention at all what the only thing i'm saying that we have some we have certain groups for you to choose from, based on availability of your schedule, because of course. it's a treatment plan I don't want it to be an issue with regard to your everyday life, this is to help you continue to build with the everyday life. But what other people are dealing with in group, I would not want that to be. A cause of regression for you that's one thing, but there may be someone in in every group, whether you known or unknown okay. that's suffering from some type of personality disorder. Act act could not and to be perfectly honest, would not, under any circumstances promise you that this group doesn't have any personality that presents in in such a way, because personality disorders themselves are constantly evolving and so."
16122.0,Patient,What does that mean. That means group days not DDT because.
498.0,Provider,"yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't place you're in a DVD group, let me start."
16122.0,Patient,"that's that that's a that's a huge thing because, like every every single time psychiatry just tried to put being group therapy it's been DDT and it like half the people there have borderline and they. don't I don't do that."
498.0,Provider,This would not be a group who deal with borderline disorder and it wouldn't be a group cater to that what i'm saying is that there could be someone in group with borderline but the group is not borderline based does that make sense.
16122.0,Patient,"yeah like if the if if there's like a you know, a ptsd. resilience group or you know, like a because that's my whole thing is trying to build resilience trying to you know get to the point where I can have a flashback and pull myself out of it, you know I where I don't have to disassociate to. You know, like get through the day for. That particular event, you know, like grounding skills or you know basically stuff that I can do in real time."
498.0,Provider,How do you thought about continuing the Zola. Along with the stimulant. zoloft to continue to support you with regard to your trauma.
16122.0,Patient,"That all the. The issue with the zoloft is that, basically, like, I was prescribed it for OCD. which was actually a trauma sometime."
498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16122.0,Patient,"Basic which I was recorded a few years ago and I. So it's like it hasn't helped at all with the ptsd at all, I mean it's I mean I know that's supposedly what it's intended for but it's if anything it's made it worse by basically um. It basically like would would block my like it would like I would have a I would be triggered like I would know like okay i'm just associating you know I wouldn't recognize the visible signs, but I couldn't. recognize until sometimes like days later, what what was causing it now like you know, cutting down from 50 to 25. it's like i'm like oh that was caused by this, you know i'm having a lot of memories come back a lot of you know realizations like Oh, that was not okay oh like you know and but i'm also able to identify the emotions. To be like you know pretty much in real time, like, I mean it's not like the emotions hit me hours days later. i'm not constantly having these oh that's what that was about oh that's why you know that's why that hit me so hard oh that's why I randomly want to cry you know it's like. Somebody coming through a checkout line being nice their kid reminded me of the time my mom was her dad was absolutely horrible to me going, you know and abusive it nobody did it. You see what I mean it's like I work out because I deal with so many people, including families kids it's like constantly. And so i've actually made like a ton of progress. Like just cutting out that so loft so this point is the zoloft is doing more harm than good, it has been for a long time."
498.0,Provider,"Oh, this is this is. This is what i'd like for you to. consider what we can discontinue this particular today we can discontinue the zoloft today. I would like to confer with Ashley before we start you want to stimulate. You can meet with me. In one week."
16122.0,Patient,That confirm with Ashley or amanda which which one.
498.0,Provider,"Ashley Ghanem she had your last session on December, the second and then like for you to meet with amanda you meet with her tomorrow right."
16122.0,Patient,Oh no Friday.
498.0,Provider,On Friday.
16122.0,Patient,"yeah and I in my see the my primary care for my knee on a Tuesday tomorrow tomorrow morning, so I should know like basically Am I cleared for light duty at work right like I want to get back to work as soon as possible. Because that's a that's a positive thing for me and. it's real. All good for you know everything so. My boss is is really great you know, he was like you know us like because I actually wanted to go back to work after my dislocation because. I know shane i'm no stranger to dislocations it's something that that happened just with my joints and. It was huge being able to my roommates were did everything right, this time it made me realize just how messed up my parents were because i've just looked at I dislocated actually broke my right knee in 2008. And you know, I was hopping around the House doing laundry fetching things for my mom you know caretaking I was never allowed to actually recover."
498.0,Provider,Evan are you available at 530 on next Monday.
16122.0,Patient,in the morning. Oh yeah should be.
498.0,Provider,"OK OK um I like to speak to Ashley and then I would like to speak with amanda after your visit on Friday. Just to make one to kind of make sure that. me it is able to continuously support you in a way that will be supported beneficial discuss with her accommodating you with a group, if not one of mine, one that she leads, even if it's not in combination with myself. Just to make sure that. we're kind of creating a platform for you to leap from and not have to move backwards, again, because I do feel like a lot of your treatment has been limbo. And you know you had some successes and then you have some regression, you had some successes and then you had some regression, I would really like to formulate a collaborative plan based on your goals what you'd like to pursue and then what both myself and your therapist also. Just can support fully, so that you can feel like Okay, this is a strategy that I feel like it's going to be great for me if I run into any hurdles. I have a team that I can continue to collaborate with and we'll make adjustments from me and moving forward, but I would like to speak to other members of your of your treatment team first. And then you know circle circle back around to you to let you know Okay, this is what we've all kind of collectively come up with that way you can also feel free to discuss it with amanda on Friday. Okay um she'll she'll she'll have would have already spoken to her with it about you know about it, then also spoken to her about available groups that way. She can also in the meantime be looking for Okay, what do I have that will be a best fit for you present it to you on Friday, and you can say I like that, and then on Monday. I can piggyback right on and say Okay, this is what I think that we were moving forward with, and we can go from here, how does that sound."
16122.0,Patient,"That sounds really good. Okay yeah that sounds good good plan. yeah and, as I mean, as long as the group isn't you know i'm glad you guys offer other groups of the DVD that's that's a huge improvement for me and would be very helpful and as long as the the you know the whoever is leading it can you know. You know, can can make can make sure that, like nobody hijacks it or you know there's there's specific be like interpersonal things that can that both my parents did like you know constantly interrupting you know hijacking conversations making everything about them. But at the same time it's like you know. You know those people exist everywhere, I mean, I have a couple I have like three co workers who are you know who felt very familiar because. It turns out they're just like my mom I have one who'd split splits you know, like one day i'm i'm her best friend the next you know she inexplicably hates and i'm like it's not me it's her you know so that's actually a good. You know, been a good kind of exposure therapy for how to deal with difficult people."
498.0,Provider,"I think we have a plan. i'll have my can navigators schedule this appointment, so that you do not have to. And then. You can just look forward to seeing me on Monday okay."

Our all induction patient is also exhibiting some. components of the borderline personality. Assessment plan for now is to. collaborate with the patient new therapist he was previously with Ashley gannon confused me on an appointment, on Friday, with amanda Wilkinson collaborate with both Ashley and amanda with regard to the patient. Presentation during visit and. formulate a strategy with regard to. Pursuing treatment, including the inclusion of our patients educated on the components of the program worthwhile to therapy she doesn't currently deny. any difficulty with regard to compliance of those components, however, she seems to. seems to make to me about. How she participates in the group what group um she has a. Real. system offenses with regard to the team I believe it's because she's been banned from previously that he. Has a borderline disorder, but. Patient does appear supportive with regard to compliance now we're collaborating with Ashley Ghanem enemy to work with thinking looking fun and i'm really looking for me reporting stuff."
