383.0,Provider,morning. i'm having so much trouble with my.
14365.0,Patient,audio and I don't know why can you hear me okay.
383.0,Provider,Are you able to hear me.
14365.0,Patient,I can hear you but i've been having. feedback from others that say they can't hear me.
383.0,Provider,I can hear you fine.
14365.0,Patient,"Okay, good."
383.0,Provider,"yeah okay good. I was a little concerned because I had some problems on Friday. hearing a few of my clients, then, but I just I can hear you so i'm glad."
14365.0,Patient,"Okay, good me too i'm glad because I was, I was trying to test my speakers and I couldn't hear myself, so I was concerned."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and if do you mind tilting your cameras slightly down because I can see more of you. Okay, great okay. So i'm just was wondering if you had a chance to see the other therapists and where you thought you want to take things, maybe we could talk about that briefly first before we get into the. yeah."
14365.0,Patient,"I did meet with her, it was kind of a rushed meeting because I was coming out of an appointment, when I had my appointment with her, and so I got to see her and speak to her for about a half an hour and I have no interest in moving forward with her."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
14365.0,Patient,We just weren't a good fit.
383.0,Provider,"Okay well that's good to get that clarification and. just wanted to see how that went so we can just jump in, let me just double check some sort of nuts and bolts here. That we so you are going to. schedule an appointment with chantel did was that something."
14365.0,Patient,"Oh no that wasn't necessary. So we didn't need to do that anymore, so we didn't do that, but right now, as things stand with medication, since that would be the reason why I would speak to her."
383.0,Provider,and
14365.0,Patient,i'm not taking anything right now i'm just doing my CBD before bed and some supplements to reduce cortisol.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"And that's pretty much it i've been sleeping really well. through the night, I mean i'm tossing and turning a lot but i'm sleeping through the night."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"Getting a good eight hours so that's good my I don't I want to say was about a week ago, or so it was around, I want to see the Eighth, so it only a few days ago. The eighth was the exact two month anniversary that I got off the birth control pill. And I was driving home from my dad's house and I had felt this like it was like something switched off in my brain where I started to feel really confident again and more like myself again and my all my symptoms were gone, it was very strange and it came out of nowhere."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
14365.0,Patient,"i'm thinking, a lot of maybe what was going on with me had to do with my hormones and getting the fill out of my system."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"My endocrinologist had said that a lot of time with high cortisol levels can be attributed to the birth control pill, so I thought that might be part of it. But I also have been you know working a lot with slowing myself down walking slow or doing things slow or driving slower. And I think that in control it, you know, on top of the you know, removing the pill for my system was a big help and everything but i'm feeling pretty normal right now."
383.0,Provider,so great.
14365.0,Patient,"yeah so with the. situation with the guy that I was seeing I ended things with him because he had called me and I don't remember, if I had a meeting with you or not, since then, but he called me he slurring his words and drunk. And so i'm like I don't know how many things are beers you've had I don't really care at this point. Oh, it was you know, the first time that had happened. With where I had seen him that way. But I was completely turned off at that point."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah well i'm you had mentioned that he thought he might have a problem with alcohol so. That was one of your red flags.
14365.0,Patient,it's a deal breaker for me and that's for sure.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"Was upset I mean he understood my point of view and where i'm coming from with it, and he understands where where why and how I feel the way I feel so it wasn't you know, a bad situation he was sad mostly. But you know that's not a problem that I have so it's something he needs to work on for himself and I hope he does, I hope you."
383.0,Provider,can come to a better place.
14365.0,Patient,"where he doesn't feel like you need to drink like that. Or, for whatever reason."
383.0,Provider,Was that during the conversation when he was drinking that you broke it off.
14365.0,Patient,"No, it wasn't during that conversation that conversation because i've learned from my past to not have serious conversations with people that are intoxicated. The time they will remember it afterward anyway, so if you're going to say something meaningful to someone it's better to wait until a more appropriate time to where they actually have a coherent conversation with you and respond accordingly, so waited until a few days went by and. He was like you know something seems off with you and I said yeah you know this is how I feel about it, and I was also trying to get myself in check and sleep well and start feeling better and. funny because the day after I broke up with him I started feeling better, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. But it just it allowed me to put more focus back on me, instead of trying to think about other people in a relationship, right now, I think it was just bad timing, all the way. For us to get into something at that point, but you know I started off with saying I need to get my head on straight and I need to you know focus on me right now and then. As the conversation went on the drinking part came out he's like Oh, the truth comes out now you know and i'm like Well, no, I mean i've you've always known how I felt about drinking, I told him before how I felt about it and. was a big part of my decision but it wasn't, the only thing that created the wanting to back away feelings and me so."
383.0,Provider,I.
14365.0,Patient,"Just laid it all out and I, we had a long conversation and talked about it and so he understands and I said, maybe in the future, you know if you can get your drinking better control, and I can get my head on straight and maybe. We can have something that might be special but the timing is just not right, right now, things aren't going so."
383.0,Provider,"Well, sounds like you, you know sorted that out, and you know the sort of the proof is in the pudding in terms of how you feel after you've done it. You feel. How was your job going at the golf."
14365.0,Patient,"Good I worked, my first shift by myself, I trained one time because i've been doing it for so long, they didn't really need to train me too much."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"Well, I had one ship last weekend. And that was a training shift on Saturday, and then I worked, yes or I work Saturday and Sunday. mm hmm I really enjoy it, I really, really am glad that i'm working there it really just I love doing what I do it, so I really enjoyed being out there."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm that's great. How are you How are things going with your dad and. going over there and checking in on this.
14365.0,Patient,Past with my dad or good i've kind of pulled away from that situation where i'm not going there every day anymore.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm I think is helpful.
14365.0,Patient,"I don't feel as obligated to go there and help him out every single day. necessary for me to do that every single day. So I. pulled away mad, and now that i'm feeling better able to have a little bit more patience with him. When he when he brings up something i'm not snapping at him and I have a lot more patients."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,that's just in feeling better that's just coming from feeling better.
383.0,Provider,"Good um what what caused you to pull away from going every day, did you just feel like he didn't need it, and it was also not great, for you to be there every day or just."
14365.0,Patient,"It was overwhelming for me and i'm one that worries a lot about my dogs, and so I always wanted to make sure that you know they had water and that they had their you know certain things that I do that he doesn't do."
383.0,Provider,The and.
14365.0,Patient,"So you know i'm like their dogs, they can survive without any of these things that i'm doing you know, and he he does give them water it's not like you completely neglect the dogs. Because I was so perfectionist about everything, and I wanted things done my way. It was necessary for me in my mind that I needed to be there every day I needed to walk them I need to make sure that they had fresh water I needed to make sure they had the stick, so that their teeth are good, you know there's certain things that. I felt that I needed to do every day to keep things going and it's just not that way it's they can survive without me being there every day and it takes a lot of pressure off of me, at the same time, by not going and doing that."
383.0,Provider,So I feel.
14365.0,Patient,"I feel like a lot of pressure has been taken off me in that way, I took the pressure off myself."
383.0,Provider,"that's so great that happen. All the time yeah so it really seems like you're kind of recognizing what a more balanced approach is to your life. You stepping back from some patterns and habits. And you're just seeing that you know you can make adjustments. Just like you can slow down, you can reduce the frequency of your visits. You can look at things a different way and then act a different way."
14365.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah i'm good at taking the steps that I need no matter what they are and what time in my life that they happen in but i've always been good at. Making sure that I fix things properly and even if it's my mental health it's going to be something I fixed properly, so I needed the tools, I needed to know what I needed to do, and now that I have those tools to know what it takes to you know, keep my anxiety levels low. and make sure that i'm making the right choices for myself and putting myself first."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,That helps a lot to be able to have those tools.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm good, what do you feel like you want to work on in therapy, now that you feel like you've kind of gotten some control over certain important things that you wanted to address."
14365.0,Patient,"that's a really good question because before all the anxiety had happened to me i'd always had had you know situations where I was always very controlling and very jealous and very possessive and that person, and that was something I always wanted to work on in therapy in the past."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"They got around to it just because I just I never did I never went to talk to anybody about it and then this happened, the anxiety situation happens so, then I had to kind of force myself to to focus on that and look at that. And now that that's being kind of handled in a way, I mean, I just want to continue to work on tips, of how to handle anxiety better because that's I think always going to be a part of my life. But I feel like i'd like to start working on me, as a person and trying not to be as consulting and jealous and possessive and. That kind of a person, so that when I do get into a relationship where it's someone that I do want to be with that it's not going to turn into some i'm not going to turn into a girl I don't want to be."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm okay um. Do you want to maybe I know you talk to me a little bit about these behaviors as they relate to previous relationships. But maybe we can go a little more into depth, not just in terms of what happened but kind of maybe if you can reflect on what happened inside of you prior to. All of a sudden becoming jealous so there's the incident there's, then the outward expression of jealousy but then there's that period in between where something's going on inside of you. Before the behavior you know before the outburst or before that expression."
14365.0,Patient,"Of jello more like what, what do you think causes you to be jealous what causes or where it's coming from, or what you're afraid of."
383.0,Provider,"yeah, what are the feelings that come up. Prior to a controlling episode or and stating from."
14365.0,Patient,"From when I put myself in that position again and I remember things that were that way with my last relationship and things that would come up like. For instance, there was a he was working with the company's leasing apartments and there was a. Like a sport day where they went all the all the people from all the communities would meet up and they would have like a sports day. And he wanted to carpool with a bunch of girls that he worked with. And I was like no I don't want you to be driving with a bunch of girls that I don't know and who knows what they feel for you or you know, and my my initial feeling was I don't want to lose you. I don't want you to be in a situation, because then, you may start liking, one of them and then leave. So it was I think it's more of a and i've never had any abandonment issues i've my both my parents never abandoned me i've never had any feelings of being left. A lot like i'm going to be abandoned and. For somebody else and i'm going to be left alone and."
383.0,Provider,i'm gonna have to deal with and I don't want to deal with it.
14365.0,Patient,"I think that that alone is a lot of the reason why I don't end up in relationships, because I don't want to be left. That could be a really good thing we can work on."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
14365.0,Patient,"Again, though I usually people have a background of abandonment when they feel waste like this isn't that right or can you have no background and still feel this year."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think that. I kind of. Take a new approach of. You know I don't I think we come into this world, we can come into this world with propensities that are not based in this current life. Oh so. tendencies. So that that's you know. that's my feeling about that you know it's not necessarily related to what's happened in this life all the time can just be. Like I said just a propensity or a tendency. I the other, I have another question so there's that feeling of you don't want to be left. Which leads to the question of the subject of living alone or being alone. And not being part of a family or a unit. So what that is for you and what has been maybe, and then the other question of this is kind of maybe just another reason I don't know you can. His attention you know when someone's attention is on you you're getting you're getting all of their you know you're getting sort of lifted up and you're getting when the attention goes to someone else then then they're getting sort of the highlight and you're not getting the attention. So for me. Okay yeah."
14365.0,Patient,"My first boyfriend my first serious boyfriend in high school you still want to go hang out with his friends and this happened with many boyfriends it wasn't just him. hanging out with his friends and I would I would get upset and he'd be like, why are you upset I want to help my friends are just my friends and i'm like well because you're you're giving them the attention you're spending time with them. you're not giving me the attention during this time you're giving them the attention so and it's not somebody that I like I don't like being that way. I when I noticed myself doing these things i'm like oh God like who wants to be with a girl like that you know, like so I recognize that it's not something I want to be and it's not good behavior. Right feelings are so strong that it doesn't matter what I feel like or how I recognize it, I still lash out that way and I. Get that he's not you know, and he goes he tried to explain to me he's like the love that I have for you. Is not the same as the love that I have for my friends it's a different type of situation it's not like i'm taking love away from you to give to them it's just different. And it helps to kind of hear that but it's still that feeling was still there, that you're giving this attention to someone else, and I want it for me. And i've always I am the only child so i've always gotten all the attention, maybe that's part of it, I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah it could be, but it also could be the thing about only children is they are. They don't get I mean they get concentrated attention from their parents, but when their parents aren't there there's other. kids to be with so there's often a lot of alone time as an only child and there's there's sort of a lack of connection unless it's when the parents are there so so there can be kind of a craving for attention. And maybe, particularly from appear or someone not in this parents are in sort of a elevated position of authority, so it would be kind of someone that's more on your level, you know. And maybe that's part of like there's a deep need in there, that of just wanting to wanting to be more in social connection and experience of social connection, but on an entire kind of on an intimate level like. In a family, you know if you have brothers and sisters, they would be really pretty close to you. So. Maybe you want to build or continue to work on, I know you do have friendships and stuff but continue to work on. Finding and connect collecting you know friendships people to have social connection with. So that when you do get involved in a relationship, you have. You have a group of people that you're in in connection whether you're developing relationship with."
14365.0,Patient,Instead of depending on him for all of the attention that.
383.0,Provider,"yeah. In the past, when you look back at your past relationships, do you see Oh well, I kind of really did that was my primary social relationship that was my primary."
14365.0,Patient,"Since I was a child i've had one friend of the time i've never had a real big group of friends i've had friends that like. If I do have a group of friends, I usually will choose to hang out with them one on one instead of, as a group. Because i'm i'm always kind of like. I don't know I feel better one on one, no matter what it is really if it's if it's a group of friends if it's a you know, a business situation. it's always better for me to have that one on one time, and I think."
383.0,Provider,My.
14365.0,Patient,"mom and I were so close growing up we're like best friends, and we always have been. I spent a lot of time with her as a child, because of that, so when I would have a friend over it would be you know my friend and I hanging out together and then she would go home and then i'd be back to my mom again so it was always. You know person to person, one on one it was not, I was never in a group of friends."
383.0,Provider,Okay. um.
14365.0,Patient,"And yes, when I wasn't relationships, I would always be with them instead of my friends."
383.0,Provider,"Okay yeah sometimes people kind of neglect their friends when they get involved in a relationship. So. Overly investing in that one social that in that relationship for social fulfillment and connection right so meeting that need mate may help reduce your. That sort of deep desperation of like Oh, you know don't don't leave me, you know I don't want to. You know I need you, you know, because if you go away i'm going to be left alone right."
14365.0,Patient,yeah makes a lot of sense.
383.0,Provider,"Without social connections. So, making your friends would help with that yeah and I think your job. is really great because it is you're you're having these micro social connections, you know but there's still there's sort of like the opportunity is there for them to kind of flow in and flow out and. So I think that's really, really healthy for you yeah I agree. What is the status of your friendship relationships now."
14365.0,Patient,"Well, the friend, that I was hanging out with on a daily basis, moved away to indiana to get married I don't know if I told you about her. She is her and I started talking again about a month ago, and then things kind of blew up she she had a big fight with her husband and said she was coming home and leaving him. And then she never ended up doing that so she's the kind of person where she's a very big people pleaser so she's doing everything she can to make it work, even though she's unhappy in this situation. And there's only so much I can do to help her with that and I can do only so much she's going to have to make these choices on her own. been friends, since we were 13 years old, so we've known each other for really long time i've seen her. choices in her life and there's things that i've been trying to help her with that sometimes you just can't lead a horse to you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink so. Our last conversation over texts and she's like I don't know what to say, and I said yeah i'm kind of at a lack of words myself. After experiencing the whole big blow up and then her saying i'm packing up my stuff i'm coming home and then not doing it, so I don't really know where she's at right now, with all that. But she was my closest friend for the last 10 years before she moved away and. When I was extremely involved with the politics, and so it didn't really affect me because I had all that going on in my life, where I was super distracted by that. And not having anybody else that I was hanging out with really I have a guy friend he's married that we go hiking every so often and we've been friends, since high school. There was never anything going on there, but it was just a friendship that you know, he was always there for me, I was always there for him, and we always give each other, advice and things like that, but. He was he's really the only friend that I see on a regular basis now and it's really not like we hang out we just go hiking together occasionally so. I don't really have anybody that i'm like hanging out with on a regular basis, I have a lot of acquaintances from my past work environments that I."
383.0,Provider,Still with. each other mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,far as a good friendship that's not exist.
383.0,Provider,So um what is it like for you to kind of reflect on on this. Your friend right now.
14365.0,Patient,"Well it's sad it's sad that I don't have. More people in my life that i've completely you know alienated I want to say alienated them, but I have the opportunity to meet people and I choose not to for."
383.0,Provider,Some reason.
14365.0,Patient,"I don't know if it's because I feel like they're going to demand too much of my time, and you know, sometimes I like to just be alone and not be around people and. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, by not hanging out with them so it's kind of a scary thing for me not being able to have those relationships and it's scary for me to have them so i'm kind of stuck in between."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and. what's scary to you about having relationships."
14365.0,Patient,um I just.
383.0,Provider,I feel like.
14365.0,Patient,"If it were to be like become a close friendship, where we see each other, a lot. You know if there was a time where it became too much for me where they would be asking me to hang out more than I would want to that I would end up ruining it because I wouldn't want to be. With them as much as they would want to be with me."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so that might have to do, also with communication like communicating your needs, and they would it be that you would communicate that need to abruptly or and then the person might get offended."
14365.0,Patient,"yeah and you know, like there's a girl that I knew in high school who lives by my dad's house and she's only minutes away. We had just started talking. she's a friend of mine on instagram so I was talking with her on instagram and she said we should go walking sometime. And she does like 10 mile walks every day she's very she had a stroke, in her past and so she's very, very. That she's big on on exercising and so i'm not i'm not one to go to 10 mile walks every day but. I mean if we were to meet up and she's got kids and stuff and a husband and you know there's not a lot of extra time that she has in her life to come hang out with me, so I kind of just let it go."
383.0,Provider,"Thinking like oh she's probably just busy, and she doesn't want to hang out so."
14365.0,Patient,I always end up pushing it away and making an excuse for it instead of actually trying to meet up with people.
383.0,Provider,So if you made a shift and just reached out like to a couple of people do you want to take a walk or you want to meet at the coffee shop. Do you feel just just doing that putting yourself out there and that way might be good for you.
14365.0,Patient,yeah I think I should.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and then maybe we can work on the communication aspect of what if it comes out that they wanted to spend more time or that you, you need to negotiate something and. Because that's a that's a problem that you know we we don't have currently it's like currently right now it's just kind of gathering or a few connections that you can. Just start to connect socially you know with other people."
14365.0,Patient,Right yeah I don't really feel like I need to go out and talk to a bunch of people right now and start you know getting a group of friends together. But I think you know one connection here and one connection there and making plans and hanging out and making it more of a regular thing would be really good for me.
383.0,Provider,"yeah okay um and tell me a little bit more about this thing of that you said you said you like, to be alone."
14365.0,Patient,"I do, I, like my alone time because it gives me a chance to recharge and relax and being just my own space and. i've always been that way until I started getting anxiety, I was, I was really okay being alone, and then I started getting really lonely which was awkward for me because i've never felt lonely like that. That has now since gone so I don't feel lonely anymore. i'm enjoying myself alone and it's completely fine and I feel like myself again so that's good but. I have moments, where you know if i'm out doing something or if I do my errands and I come home and I relax it's nice to just be you know and not have anybody really around, there are times, where I would like to hang out with people. But most of the time i'm okay being by myself."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm well that's really good I think that's a strength yeah you know and and and I think that you know you're really attuned to yourself, so you know if you're by yourself and things aren't good, and you know yeah. And so, but the fact that you can be by yourself and you enjoy it and it's you know it's sort of recoup time as well and. that's it that's a strength, I don't think you know I think should feel good about that as a you know it's a good quality yeah."
14365.0,Patient,"I always thought so and I feel like a lot more people should be able to be alone, and a lot of people can."
383.0,Provider,"write a lot of people yeah do have. And then. You know. But I think if there are fears related to being around in relationship, you know that that's important to to address. Do you want it to say anything more about past relationships, where you were controlling. or jealous and when we've kind of identified maybe one reason why there was that you know kind of wanting to be possessive. You know the other aspect of controlling I think that touches on other some other. tendencies yes."
14365.0,Patient,"Controlling the controlling part of me. I think. I think it's more of a see how far I can get with you. kind of a thing, maybe pushing the boundaries, a little bit and seeing if you're going to allow me to control you and, if I can get away with it and kind of testing to see what kind of person this person is. If you're going to let me control you then you're a weak person and Do I really want to be with a weak person I don't know if i'm trying to find excuses to not be with this person. Or if it's if it's just a testing of a boundary like a game for me or I don't know exactly why I get to that point where I try so hard to control them, but I feel like it might go hand in hand with the jealousy. Because i'll get jealous and then i'll try to control because it gives me the feeling of more security with that person, because if you let me control him because i'm jealous that I got my way and now i'm okay."
383.0,Provider,But then you didn't do you see them as a weak person.
14365.0,Patient,"um I eventually do I start to lose respect for them, the more they give in to me."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so the first part of it is. kind of a power there's a power can thing happening yes. So. When you're in a power. trying to get power over someone I mean this can also kind of. harkening back to your belief systems about. What power is and. What you what your risk, you know what what you risk who you respect what kind of people you respect what kind of people you don't respect your kind of judgments about people. and and so forth. But I mean it tilts into an unhealthy dynamic, particularly if there's like a power struggle."
14365.0,Patient,"yeah well I feel like if there was, I mean and I don't know if this is something that happens because of the men I choose like I choose guys that will let me do that to them. or I you know I end up with guys on purpose for that purpose for for allowing me to push the envelope that will let me do that. Because I feel like if there was a guy that I was with that said no you're not going to do that, to me, you know, like i'm not going to allow you to push me around or tell me what to do, or go to my friend's house get over it, you know that kind of a thing, where it would. It would kind of, say, no i'm setting the boundary right here, you don't get to do that, you don't get to talk to me that way, it would almost be and I always said that i'm like and I ended up meeting a strong man who can push back on. put me in my place. No i'm not gonna let you do this because I feel like I do it on purpose to see what you're gonna let me do."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"And so, if he does push back there was one guy that I was with that did that that didn't listen to me and didn't take my shit. and respecting him tremendously and falling very much in love with him. But the other guys that, let me do what I wanted, let me have my way I ended up walking all over. It I think it's the type of man that I have in my life and and do I, I would hope that I would pick guys that are strong enough to be with me. But I end up a lot of the time with guys that are not."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well that can be just in your selection as you're. Identifying guys to go out with and to continue relationships with you could put up there straight out in front, you know. Where you could even but if you're on a dating profile, you could throw it on the dating profile like I need a strong man i'm a strong woman and I need I am seeking like you know, a strong man that won't. Let me dominate because I have a tendency to dominate you know."
14365.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean is that something where do you think that comes from is that just. me trying to get my way and seeing how far I can get with it, is it because I almost feel like it's a game."
383.0,Provider,"um well there is some kind of power it's a power struggle. You know and there's some thing that you value in. and being able to assume power over. And there's something may be romantically attractive about that, because you said you know you fall deeply in love with someone when they The more that they are have demonstrate that that they have power over. You or that they can they can assume dumb you know sort of the dominant. role right. But I don't know if you have not. been in a relationship where that person really did have a lot of power over you if that was something that you would really find ultimately to be healthy, or that you would like."
14365.0,Patient,"yeah I mean the in the in the one relationship and the he was the one that i've I have not met a guy since him or before him that I was more in love with. than him the one that actually stood out to me and had the power and. felt like he could push back and not lose me over it, because I think a lot of guys that I am with it, you know feel like Oh, if I push back then she's gonna leave me or she's going to not want to be with me, which is completely the opposite of the truth."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"and be a end up getting scared that Oh, if I don't give her what she wants she's going to get mad and leave. And I think that's kind of why I do it because I want to see their what kind of man they're made of you know what can you take this are you gonna are you going to give me my way are you going to push back on me. And I it's almost like my way of testing is this the kind of man, I want to be with. Which is messed up because I want to put anybody through that and I don't want to put someone through that I don't want them to have to go through that. But in the same way it's like my only way of knowing do you have the balls to be with me do you have what it takes to have the ability to. To be a man and stand up to you know if someone's going to tell you what to do, are you gonna be able to say no to them. And I feel like a lot of the guys that i've been with my dad is actually this way. My dad is very influenced by people in his life if he if someone tells him some advice or give some advice it's like he listens to that doesn't matter who they are, if they have good intentions, at heart or not he's going to listen to them."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14365.0,Patient,"That always really bothered me about like I wanted him to be a strong man and stand up to people and say no, this is what I want to do, I don't want to do what you say."
383.0,Provider,"hmm okay so that's interesting. path, a little bit more about your father and how he how you saw this quality of listening as kind of a weakness."
14365.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I still to this day, I mean he always when he when he takes advice from his friends, he has a lot of friends and they're all very interesting people and strange people. he'll listen to somebody who's who's maybe just an acquaintance he'll tell them a story about something and they'll give them advice and he'll take it. And he'll say oh so and so said this or he'll say words that weren't his word, so I know they came from someone else and he'll he'll be saying the same things they told him and. This isn't you like you're listening to someone else and i've heard him be on the phone with people, and you know, maybe you should do that and then he goes, and does it i'm like what like it just to me that's. have your own mind make your own decisions have your own plan and your own path in life. and know what the best thing for you is instead of depending on everybody else's advice for you and your life or or your family or your friends or to tell you what to do. And so it's that's important to me in a man's be able to do that, and I think that may be why i'm testing them to see if they have that ability to stand up."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I think that that may be that's that you, you observed and him. That I mean not that it's not a good I think it's a good thing to be open to listening to whoever you know, but then then being able to make your own decisions not necessarily based make decisions based on what everybody said, you know right. yeah so it seems like you know you definitely have cultivated cultivated that in yourself. And you want somebody that has their own thoughts and mine, too, I mean Would you mind it if you said let's say Okay, this is just a silly example. you're getting on an airplane and or you're buying airplane tickets and you are like I really like to sit by the window, but I really liked it, I really like if you sat next to me and and he said well. Okay well i'd like to sit next to you, even though I really like to sit by the window or I really like to sit by the aisle. Would you rather him say I like I sit by the i'm going to sit by the aisle you sit by the window hustling and between us and they'll have be how we fly. Or would you rather the guy said i'd like you know you, you want to sit next to me so i'll forego sitting buddy i'll. I don't know if that's a very great example but."
14365.0,Patient,"No, I understand where you're going with that. And that's it's interesting because part of me wants him to forego it but part of me doesn't I split in that in that situation because. I almost want him to say you know what i'm not going to give up what I want and I don't want you to give up what you want, it will have to just deal with not putting together. And I don't know how I would react to that, I think I think I would be like Okay, I guess that's fair it's it's not something i'm used to somebody saying to me because everybody would just bend to what I would want them to do and there it is."
383.0,Provider,Right right and.
14365.0,Patient,I would like that.
383.0,Provider,"So, so you would you would be you'd be like okay well that's kind of you know."
14365.0,Patient,Compromise I like the compromise there.
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think that you need to kind of a man someone, we have to just honor our wishes, you know, and if that's your wish, and if that would is what you like you, like a strong man that has his own opinions and maybe his own opinions are going to go. You know opposite to yours and you're going to be alone in a lovely that situation. But you know, maybe you want to explore that in dating for time and put it out there, I mean don't hesitate, and just put it out and not as a test, but just as an honest. You know I don't think, I think, maybe we we can you can. switch that test so it's not necessarily covert it's very overt you're just saying I like men that have their own opinion about what they like, and I don't want to be. i'm a very strong woman and I don't want it, I can tend to control relationships and that's not the kind of relationship I want yeah yeah just be open and honest with them from the start yeah yeah."
14365.0,Patient,yeah I like that idea.
383.0,Provider,Maybe.
14365.0,Patient,"Do you think it's an okay way to be or, should I try to change the way that I am."
383.0,Provider,"I don't think that that's something you could could change I don't I mean you could maybe soften a bit you know so that. I don't know I don't know it seems like I think I have to think about it a little bit more yeah it seems like you it's not something that you. You know that's what you like, and a man and being that your father also was a certain way, and you really just know you don't like that and that's taken you know i'm sure. you've not like that, for years, you know certain qualities and people we see over a long period of time and we're just like no we don't like it."
14365.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I don't respect somebody that that lets other people think for them. So I don't know if I could ever or if I wanted change that I think it's something that I, I would want to have I want a strong man, he has his online I don't know any woman that wouldn't. settle I mean having having a guy that's going to just roll over for you and do whatever you want, and make it so that you get your way all the time doesn't sound like a very strong healthy relationship."
383.0,Provider,yeah I mean I think some women can be so. lean so much toward wanting things their way that they they wouldn't do well with somebody that. That wouldn't go along yeah.
14365.0,Patient,"yeah and I there's a part of me that's that I understand that, but ultimately, if I want to respect you. i'm not going to be able to be with someone that would do that and or allow myself to be that person to you know watch that happen."
383.0,Provider,Right right so.
14365.0,Patient,"But yeah there is a part of me that says, you know yeah, of course, I want to do everything that I wanted to do you know but long run, long term if that's not going to work out well."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. i've been with guys that have done that i've been with guys that have not and.
14365.0,Patient,The guys that have done that I just it doesn't end well.
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Are you thinking about going back and starting to date, again, or are Where are you with that right now."
14365.0,Patient,"I do, I want to do that soon, now that i'm starting to feel better I feel like I could you know have somebody else there in my life and share moments and times with them."
383.0,Provider,i'm give it maybe another month or.
14365.0,Patient,"So just to kind of settle into myself and and get used to sleeping again and and and then, once once i'm ready in about a month or so I think i'll jump back into the dating scene and see what I can find."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good um is there anything else you want to address to Jane do you feel like we addressed that topic sufficiently for."
14365.0,Patient,"i'm glad we're talking about this. Is this is something i've always wanted to deal with for a long time since i've been in relationships and i've noticed that this pattern is bad, so I wanted to kind of address it and see where we could get with it so i'm glad we talked about that."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm just gonna look here at your. chart and see if there's anything that I need to attend to."
14365.0,Patient,"Oh, I missed the questionnaire that I was supposed to do with bright health and this that so I need to discover with them to do that."
383.0,Provider,yeah the the. The weekly questionnaires.
14365.0,Patient,"I don't know if it's weekly they had me set for that, like for a month, and it was on my schedule and then I was in an appointment and I wasn't able to make it so i've missed that but. I think that's something they want me to do so, I don't know if that's if that's just a one time thing or is that something that."
383.0,Provider,The pH Q nine surveys are weekly before your appointments or right before you're.
14365.0,Patient,Even know about those.
383.0,Provider,yeah and then you have the A survey that is just a one time survey and then the er Q survey I don't know how often that one needs to be done i'm sorry I oh that's okay.
14365.0,Patient,"i'm wondering if there's someone that can send me everything at once, so I can do it all together is that all different stuff."
383.0,Provider,"And the link that I had the care navigator send last. Last time we talked you might want to check with with that link and see what but the three surveys, are the pH Q nine to ace is a one time survey and then the er Q survey I think it's a repeated one."
14365.0,Patient,email and then i'll just correspond with that person.
383.0,Provider,"So I think the peer support. Is the meeting that you mentioned that you missed Okay, that was a no show. And that is what's called a it's a kit clinical communication assessment it's done by another person and bright heart health I think it's just a one time meeting okay yeah."
14365.0,Patient,"All right, yeah i'll just i'll go to the customer service and see what I can ask them."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thanks, so I think we do need to set up another appointment because I don't think there's another one in. yeah."
14365.0,Patient,How often do you think we should be meeting.
383.0,Provider,"I think bi weekly is a good rhythm if that works for you or if you'd like to okay. So Mondays. Okay. I have 10 available on Monday on the 25th and then I can also make two appointments for you in November, if you just like to get those scheduled, so we don't have to pass with it Okay, so that will be the 25th at 10.
