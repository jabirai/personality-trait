386.0,Provider,"Perfect Tobias alrighty so i'm going to go ahead and get things started for you. It looks like that the care navigation sent you over to us in regards of a prescription concern that you have you've been out of medication since yesterday Is that correct. mm hmm and is that medication that buprenorphine naloxone eight dash two milligrams sublingual film. yeah her effect, and so what they notated is that you had overused your medication Is that correct."
15235.0,Patient,"No, I just ran out yesterday, and it was supposed to last me today."
386.0,Provider,Okay that's that was so you took your last dose yesterday. yeah okay perfect your last dose about morning afternoon when was your last dose.
15235.0,Patient,A leaner afternoon.
386.0,Provider,"Later afternoon okay that that makes me feel a lot better okay. yeah so it looks like here on the 14th you went over to righted pharmacy and you picked up that quantity of 16 films for an eight day supply. And on the 14th the eight day supply 12345678 So if you ran out of medication yesterday it's what it is, is that the it was an eight day supply so is supposed to last for the 14 1516 1718 1920 and the 21st so today what should have been your last dose of medication versus yesterday. So um you haven't had medication, so there was medication that was taken extra at some point in time is that correct."
15235.0,Patient,"yeah I was like a one one short or something I think I am short myself one, and that was because I was already two days in withdrawals. Okay Julie, told me because I had never been I mean it's my first time taking them. Through he told me to get better and if we had to accommodate or figure something out later."
386.0,Provider,do some type of adjustment perfect okay.
15235.0,Patient,So it wasn't like I was taking you know what I mean four or five on Monday or something outrageous you know.
386.0,Provider,"With and that in that confirms the story in terms of your last dose take being taken yesterday afternoon, so. What Julie did do is send in a script and she sent it into the rite aid pharmacy on West water street in oak harbor this was before she sent it in on the 16th and she sent it in for a three day supply for quantity of six for you. And I know that there was an issue with the pharmacy for you so. is right and not the place where you want it to be at."
15235.0,Patient,Not the place.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's get that figured out for you what pharmacy do you prefer."
15235.0,Patient,"um it's actually called drug Mart. Okay, so did."
386.0,Provider,discount drug Mart is um what time do they are they already closed for the evening.
15235.0,Patient,good night okay.
386.0,Provider,"Just counter I mean, and that is the location 1062 West macpherson and highway."
15235.0,Patient,is okay.
386.0,Provider,"that's what I have here already so we're going to do. So this is a little bit of a process in order to transfer the prescription what we're having what we have to do is, we have to call over to rite aid pharmacy which can take a little bit of time. and cancel the order that was sent in by Julie at that location and then get it called into the discount drug Mart. If that makes sense Okay, so it is a little bit of a process, I have your phone number at 567-275-2977. Correct okay um i'm going to send it out a text message once that is all completed for you and I will get this completed for you, within the next 1520 minutes. As long as right he answers the phone in a timely manner if it's not done by the end of the night and then what I would recommend is just checking out when with us tomorrow. But it should be, it should be completed by tomorrow for you, I have no reason why it shouldn't be I don't want you going without medication, because I don't want you in withdrawal and so. let's see what we're able to get it transferred over I just have to call it really it really depends on just pharmacy wait times and because it has to be a verbal order to cancel. Okay okay um. But I don't see anything else going on here that's I mean there's a lot of documentation for a simple requested understand why. You know the care navigation, I do apologize if it, you know, for having to come back and forth, and I know you jumped into the Ark services a little bit earlier today he ended up dropping you out a little bit. I wasn't able to talk to you earlier on, and that was at approximately one my time so."
15235.0,Patient,um yeah I don't I don't. I don't know what the big deal with everyone from the pharmacy to other staff at get your place I don't I don't know why every moment is being.
386.0,Provider,Being I. You know I can't.
15235.0,Patient,"I was your answer, because I knew I was short on medicaid you know I mean I knew I was at least a half day early on my medicine, but like even like you said she'd calling in a three day supply MAC on last Thursday, they won't even let them touch them until today are until. yeah until Monday, they told me I could come get him i'm like my doctor just calling me which I didn't need them, then. Right, he called them in and for my zoom meeting and then they're like well, you can have them until at least a day or two early. On from the date and she didn't date them until the 23rd and this that and the other, and then it comes to this date, and it was like oh yeah well, you can come get them tomorrow but there's only six of them here and i'm like wait a minute what. What the hell is going on, so, then I called you guys there and then. Everyone there didn't know what the hell is going on."
386.0,Provider,yeah so.
15235.0,Patient,Here and.
386.0,Provider,"So the notation is is basically what what I gathered from the inquiry here, which is our messaging system is that there was basically not from not directly, but what it had notated is that you had over a used or medication."
15235.0,Patient,And so.
386.0,Provider,"The big The big question the big question was is well how much did you overuse and why you know this, we have clarity and it is a controlled substance but seeming as what she did on the 14th is you know you're already in withdraw at that moment in time, and so. She ended up sending in an additional three day supply over to the pharmacy that we thought was your preferred pharmacy but. And that's fine if you know we needed to get it changed that's not a problem i'd have no problem doing that. But the concern is is that, with it being a controlled substance if you're not taking it as prescribed then aim we can't issue out early research refills for many for control of medications and. Really, we want to make sure that we're all on the same page and you're you know, in terms of your health and making sure that we're not overusing consistently, because if we consistently overuse them it's going to put that tolerance level a little bit up for you, but. I don't I don't foresee that being the issue whatsoever, and so I and i'm looking at like i'm looking at the chart. Definitely, what I do recommend is refraining from using any type of. combative. or vulgar language. With any type of care and care navigator i'm just gonna say you know you seem like you say, I have a potty mouth, I have a truck driver, I was raised with biker bikers and truckers my entire life and my mouth is. Not clean whatsoever."
15235.0,Patient,"Even Sean are not talking even you know business atmosphere like conversation it's when you're not being heard. And i've seen you like you did something wrong when this is a learning process for me, as it is for my doctor who's trying to get me back to being okay. yeah absolutely and they treated me I don't know like I don't know i'm that's. Just not. For me."
386.0,Provider,"Pure frustration, and so there was a should have done time you know what they should have done it said, this is where you need to go this is who's going to be able to take care of that prescription and get everything that needs to happen. And so I do apologize that that didn't happen for you. Let me get it taken care of for you, sooner rather than later, and that way you're able to pick up your medication again. My only My only concern would be is that you wouldn't have enough they wouldn't have enough time at discount drug Mart to fulfill the medication order. Because it's already 567 so by the time I get the prescription code in in may not be ready until tomorrow morning for you, but I will get something called in, for you."
15235.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you um if there is some kind of hold up with discard this part on drunk more I think there's another farms here to here in town that maybe open any pharmacy in my town a client, it could be the other right over here too. I mean doesn't have to be drug Mart and just. let's cross that were decline you."
386.0,Provider,"Know let's cross that path, if we if we have to but. discount drug Mart has been there they're one of my primary pharmacies. In your area, so I have I don't think there's going to be any issue."
15235.0,Patient,awesome. All right.
386.0,Provider,"you're absolutely welcome, I hope you have a great afternoon bye bye. Start time was 3:36pm Pacific standard time two 3:49pm Pacific standard time. This writer reviewed with patient in regards of medication request as patient is meeting at the prescription that was electronically 17 on the 16th of September by a physician Julie key nurse practitioner for dispense quantity of six films to get patient over to his next. Group on Thursday September 23 of 2021 at 4pm patient did report that he had overused one or two tablets, and that was due to the. Patient already being in withdraw prior to starting with Julie K nurse practitioner, who has. Very actually actively notated in patients terms of why the script is the way it is. No further action is needed at this time as this writer will be calling over to rite aid pharmacy to cancel out to set order and getting it record into discount drug Mart and patient preferred pharmacy listing. Again start time 3:36pm to 3:49pm, and that is Pacific standard time with no further action needed at this time, thank you."
