11028.0,Patient,Never one.
408.0,Provider,Oh it's not never just once.
11028.0,Patient,yeah maybe.
408.0,Provider,it's just.

11028.0,Patient,or I realized like I need to stop doing.
408.0,Provider,"Because okay well let's explore ways that. What the barriers and facilitators are two enacting that change of stopping the emails because realizing it is, is the first step and then figuring out how to do it is the next step right. Now. What are you thinking right before you sent the last email you sent her what was going through your mind."
11028.0,Patient,"By cow, I wish you would just like how I can just talk to her or to say hey here's."
408.0,Provider,This missing her feeling lonely feeling.
11028.0,Patient,"Like cuz I just miss her the friendship, more than anything."
408.0,Provider,"Sure, so she's not available, so the next time you think about i'd like to talk to her, I miss her I feel lonely who's somebody else that you could reach out to to to do an email, you know exchange or. text or call."
11028.0,Patient,I don't really I don't know I don't really talk to anybody else.
408.0,Provider,yeah well that's gotta change right.
11028.0,Patient,I don't know how to change it.
408.0,Provider,Like so that's what we're working on that's what we're focused on right now is working at changing. So let's brainstorm who's somebody else that you some time to talk to either by either a phone call email text.
11028.0,Patient,"I don't really. I don't. I don't really talk to anybody like anybody else have you talked to I can't stand, you know I mean like."
408.0,Provider,Right.
11028.0,Patient,"I would just rather not talk to him, you know me."
408.0,Provider,"Okay there's the least offensive person, you know, to talk to you, besides her. Anybody at work."
11028.0,Patient,at work. yeah I don't work.
408.0,Provider,"Right used to work. When you used to work, you still keep in touch with. You know, keep in touch with any people used to work with. i'm sorry I think your screen froze. Can you still hear me Andy. Now. His Internet connection apparently was disrupted and he's left the session he's coming back in."
11028.0,Patient,Sorry.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, no problem. Was somebody was somebody calling in."
11028.0,Patient,know it just dropped connection for Center.
408.0,Provider,gotcha so Is there anyone else from your former job that you still talk to you still in touch with on Facebook or anything.
11028.0,Patient,Like i'm actually light and hope somebody buys don't really talk to anybody.
408.0,Provider,Okay um so that's part of the that's one of the barriers right to changing the behavior. Of emailing your former girlfriend and also moving on from that relationship is your social isolation you're saying you really. haven't worked on forming any other connections even acquaintances yeah um that would be available to you as you wean yourself away from being so reliant on this relationship that is now.
11028.0,Patient,dissolve.
408.0,Provider,Your former girlfriend.
11028.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"yeah so you were having some interaction with the children, you are babysitting and the neighbor that you worked on the was at the floor I think flooring you have to put in right. yeah yeah what's up with that with that connection."
11028.0,Patient,"i've been there, a couple times. But yeah it's about. been over there really I was over there, probably three or four days ago. Right now, I got some parts from a motorcycle. and Putting more stuff. Then I just think about run it off a cliff."
408.0,Provider,Oh really oh.
11028.0,Patient,"Really, I just. Not literally but I don't know. it's crazy."
408.0,Provider,How often you have you had thought thoughts of self directed violence and harming yourself.
11028.0,Patient,Now I just like going really fast and. See you know for. For whether June is not mine but. it's a quarter players hey guys about 70 $75.
408.0,Provider,"Sure, so when you think about running it off the cliff you're saying you don't really have a plan to do that it's just. A thought."
11028.0,Patient,I like I could never I could never like physically harm myself I guess it's not. me.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, what do you think is would enable you to agree that you would not harm yourself how confident, do you feel that if we agreed on that as a safety contract hundred percent. It like as a safety contract so that's what i'll ask you then to the two of us to agree to write that you're 100% confident you would even if you're thinking about it that you would not form a plan and you would not follow through on the plan to do violence to yourself."
11028.0,Patient,yeah yeah okay.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, and what are some of. The what yeah So what are some of the good things that would stop you from actually harming yourself."
11028.0,Patient,"Just life, you know there's no coming back from a you know to me."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, the finality of it."
11028.0,Patient,"yeah like if you did like and me, I guess, seeing like. Where my dad or my dad like yourself I just see the stupidity in it yeah me know dumb it was. Just I couldn't I couldn't do it."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so you think you learned a lesson from that very unfortunate experience that you had in your own."
11028.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,And that loss okay.
11028.0,Patient,"But yeah it's i'm great i'm confident you know, like even. Life can suck really bad, but there's like homeless people living on the street, in the end I don't kill yourself, you know me."
408.0,Provider,Right I.
11028.0,Patient,i'm here House like was like you know 50 inch TV yeah.
408.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so you take try to take notice and pay attention to the the resources, you have and the good things you have."
11028.0,Patient,yeah yeah I like like it still sucks.
408.0,Provider,"Still sucks it so one strategy that might help is when you do notice those good things like I have a roof over my head I enjoy watching TV, you know I have things that a lot of other people don't have. To spend time on. When you think about those things, and you, maybe take it a step further and just take a moment to get the emotion of gratitude right just allow yourself to feel the emotion of gratitude so think about it, but also feel about it get a positive feeling about that."
11028.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know why i've always. told myself that block it out. yeah I mean cuz like the way it is, I feel like I feel too much anyways."
408.0,Provider,Oh sure the negative stuff but here we're talking about a positive feeling.
11028.0,Patient,"yeah even that like in my past relationship, I thought, like make him her to her like like I was vocal about my feelings, a little too much effort right and she like wasn't at all."
408.0,Provider,sure.
11028.0,Patient,But she's. Older and like as kids and stuff so I understand.
408.0,Provider,"right but it sounds like you may be overgeneralizing from that experience of being of embracing your emotions, maybe overgeneralizing from that one instance where Maybe it was too much. To what we're talking about now, which is simply to even though you might be some even though you're suffering and the moment to allow yourself to embrace a positive emotion for yourself, not just closing it to someone else but just for yourself. Do you see what i'm saying the difference. yeah so not to shut down all emotions that would be overgeneralizing from that experience in the relationship, but still right, but in so be nuanced about how you're working with your feelings appropriate to the situation."
11028.0,Patient,"yeah I just gotta block it out, thank you. Thank you so."
408.0,Provider,When you're having a negative thought you mean or self self directed violence law.
11028.0,Patient,yeah like not even I just get sad.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so the negative emotions you you just suppress them you suppress them Okay, and if you can redirect yourself and distract yourself. yeah immediately that that works. that's a coping skill that works. But i'm just introducing a another option to add to that. yeah like when you think about the things you do have. And that. You do have resources, the good things right like counting up the good things and noticing them."
11028.0,Patient,Maybe just screwed up for that all account.
408.0,Provider,"yeah, but when you do notice that. Like you see a person out on the street, and you have a and you go back in your own door, and you have a roof just take a moment think about that and then allow yourself to develop an emotion of gratitude."
11028.0,Patient,"Like I could be out on the street like easy to feel like if I did, like have was like well born into basically like you know I mean like I feel like I could very well be one of those people in the streets and maybe one of these days might be. Because the way the way it's gone like we're like I have zero income. yeah."
408.0,Provider,"Well that's understandable a choice you do have, though, is how much time you spend dwelling on those negative thoughts. and worry thoughts, because if you allow yourself to spend much time there, it does change your brain chemistry. in the direction of depression."
11028.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,And that is an option that you can control is how much time you spend on those types of negative thoughts.
11028.0,Patient,My brain just jumps and falls and. This is comes anxiety. Right brain works.
408.0,Provider,"yeah and that's you know there's some strategy thing is gradually to retrain your brain to slow down or glad you are racing thoughts like that. But in the meantime if you're interested in those we can work on that, but in the meantime, just to be aware that the more you plug in and tune in to those negative or disaster housing parts. The worst it'll make."
11028.0,Patient,yeah Thank you Mike sound like it not covered up.
408.0,Provider,I.
11028.0,Patient,can't hear you as good as what I could.
408.0,Provider,hmm that's weird.
11028.0,Patient,yeah it might be me I don't.
408.0,Provider,see it.
11028.0,Patient,There you go.
408.0,Provider,Oh okay good. I was just saying. That maybe a step is just to remind yourself.
11028.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Even though those you have these racing thoughts and they're very negative but remind yourself oh i'm disaster rising again. Imagine a big red stop sign and just remind yourself, the more time you spend. tuning in or sinking into those negative thoughts, the more it does shift your brain chemistry. Whereas if you quickly redirect your thoughts or your behavior and activities which you said you do you're used to using that as a coping skill, so the more you can reframe that and switch to positive thoughts like I. I have some resources here that other people don't have I feel grateful for those and let that develop that can take up the space in your brain, so to speak, and shift the chemistry back. yeah it can rewire the brain electrically and chemically."
11028.0,Patient,Just can't I can't do. Like.
408.0,Provider,that's why we're working on this together.
11028.0,Patient,there's still I still feel like. yeah.
408.0,Provider,What was the group session like for you yesterday.
11028.0,Patient,"What oh I missed it, I never said. No i'm not one medicine, like all week or all weekend to like Tuesday."
408.0,Provider,"So that's something to. To be in more contact with more people who are. You know, also developing coping skills and dealing with things is to go to the group sessions every week."
11028.0,Patient,"yeah it just costs, which you know i'm not used to. Like I wanted to go I just forgot about it."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, can you set an alarm for it. To you know, to go off and that'll get your attention and then maybe a post it note, or something to remind you it's time for the weekly. Because that's something."
11028.0,Patient,yeah yes.
408.0,Provider,"Good. Well, and back to sending out the emails so next time today, maybe you can you've already sent three Maybe you can just keep keep to that and not send any more as a goal, make a specific goal for to just read today not to send anymore. As a first step. And then that's measurable it's specific it's measurable right because you can you can count to three, and you can say wait a minute I already sent three i'm setting a goal here not to do it again today. yeah so that's measurable and specific. it's an action, a direct action that you can take so when you think about that feeling of wanting to talk to somebody or missing her or feeling lonely go do something else. So that's an action you can take."
11028.0,Patient,yo.
408.0,Provider,And it's a timeframe we're just saying to the rest of today that's the time frame.
11028.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I can I can I go i'm confident, I can do that, you know."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, it was pretty reasonable as a goal."
11028.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Okay. Great. Now, what about. tomorrow. When you think about sending the first email. What about contacting your neighbor and seeing if there's if he needs any help to do that tomorrow."
11028.0,Patient,He kind of gets on my nerves if I got like if i'm around it too much you know mean. right within a certain amount of time. right into my nerves because he's kinda you want me around like. Too much more. Really ground yeah like.
408.0,Provider,Because he needs your help.
11028.0,Patient,necessarily know he's pretty capable when. He is just the Wer he's allowed to I guess I don't know it has but he's got kids and stuff too so.
408.0,Provider,"isn't that interesting Andy that seems to be a discrepancy. So a minute ago you told me that you miss having someone to to communicate with and you feel isolated, but then, on the other hand, you say that this neighbor who does want to interact with you."
11028.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,You kind of don't like the fact that he wants to be less isolated that seems like a contradiction.
11028.0,Patient,"it's different, I think, because. Like he he least. he's not he's not always that. easy."
408.0,Provider,right but that's what you're that's what you're working on letting go of you know it's not going to be Lisa. yeah so you're turning to. What is available to you other acquaintances and other opportunities for connection social connection that are available to you. So when you think about oh I don't want to call him I don't want to email or text him because he's not Lisa that's an unreasonable irrational thought. Right.
11028.0,Patient,yeah I guess. yeah i'll see why it has to be there and reasonable cause it just.
408.0,Provider,Because that relationship is done.
11028.0,Patient,No shit yeah.
408.0,Provider,So it's unreasonable to feel i'm just take distaste for another acquaintance because they are not your ex.
11028.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's not that it's like like accurate hang out with him is just want to frame Level two but I can't confide in you know. In our are you know.
408.0,Provider,"or just, of course."
11028.0,Patient,"The is you know I understand what you mean to like get away with the frame for a while I was fun yeah and that's i've done that, yet I would say my stuff but. And he's cool he's a cool guy and says hey I can get away, maybe couple times a week."
408.0,Provider,"Well, and and also your your expectations about social connection may need to be reviewed in terms of your reasonableness right and rationality, it takes time to develop a type of relationship where you feel safe and comfortable. confiding in people that's another degree of closeness right yeah and you're basically good at you from what you're telling me you're currently socially isolated so you're going to have to start fresh. To develop potential connections and get to know people and interact to them with them, to the point where maybe one one of them, or two of them, you might get to the point where you feel comfortable could find it."
11028.0,Patient,"I just don't feel like. I can start over like again I don't have a starting point, really like. Of like meeting new people or I don't have a chance to meet people like like I can't really even get out to me the people because, like it sucks here."
408.0,Provider,"Right, what about a motorcycle club a safe motorcycle club. No good."
11028.0,Patient,night.
408.0,Provider,Is there such a thing.
11028.0,Patient,That maybe like if I was in the city or something. i'm like in the country I guess.
408.0,Provider,And you don't know any acquaintances it places where you get your motorcycle parts or where you work on the motorcycle.
11028.0,Patient,motorcycle it is all. it's all. Like drug drug like.
408.0,Provider,"Oh well, that's not helpful that's not safe."
11028.0,Patient,And that's anywhere you go that's why I care.
408.0,Provider,"OK. yeah so it's it's challenging. avoid relapse and continue your recovery from substance use right, you do have to be thinking about healthy places and healthy people."
11028.0,Patient,"yeah and there's like no. Like is. It bring it'll bring you down it's an answer, bringing you down every day."
408.0,Provider,"Well, part of the pattern sometimes that develops when you're involved in substance use is your world kind of narrows down. To just other people who. deal or use substances and you start to believe that that's all there is. And that's really not the case it's just that you've not had the pursued other opportunities. And that's what you're used to notice and, like the type of people I guess. Because that's the way your brain has been shaped by the substance, use and all those experiences. Use isolated."
11028.0,Patient,Those what Dr Dr.
408.0,Provider,"yep so now your challenge to open yourself to new kinds of opportunities to be it with other people in other places doing different things. Even though part of your brain the user part of your brain tells you that there's no such thing right, but there is is just that over the time right you restrict your life became very restricted to that. yeah just seeking behaviors and so on."
11028.0,Patient,yeah I think it's gonna have to move away. Because this place sucks like Italy. I can't go store without seeing like 20.
408.0,Provider,yeah.
11028.0,Patient,"So it's going to take a day or. Something. I don't know. But it'll work its way out, which. Somehow. I just was like sometimes. How are like. Because when I go when I do go out and like try to meet new people it's like i'm too worried about something like anxiety. Right, I can act like. Like my normal self I mean like. What i'm like I just want to go back all the time."
408.0,Provider,yeah you're gonna have to learn yeah you're gonna have to really learn how to do that.
11028.0,Patient,And that's how they'll do like. Like I feel like it's just. Trying to relearn that cuz i've been trying to.
408.0,Provider,"Good. Well, good and I hear that it's a real effort."
11028.0,Patient,yeah i'm not like a kitty where I feel like I might go back to square one again. And I still want to leave stay here.
408.0,Provider,So what is a place that you can get to fairly reasonably that isn't associated with drug use.
11028.0,Patient,What do you mean like a place.
408.0,Provider,"Like the library, one of the churches. One of the schools, is there any come up with a place in your. area. Where like you said, the store you have you're going to the store right to get stuff. But you see a lot of other users there, and probably your brain causes you to hyper focus on them and not notice the other people. yeah so maybe start by going to some place that you don't so much associate. With past drug users. You can pass drug use."
11028.0,Patient,As my mind body. fires.
408.0,Provider,"Oh yeah no you're gonna have to make the effort to deal with that clearly. yeah but it's uncomfortable, but you can deal with it. mean a panic attack is panic attack is going to kill you."
11028.0,Patient,"Well yeah I don't have a heart attack sometimes because, like I said, their breakout sweat like cold cold sweat and like have all flash."
408.0,Provider,"yep that's a panic attack, but you're not want to have a heart attack from it."
11028.0,Patient,"Yes, was."
408.0,Provider,"It simply uncomfortable is just uncomfortable it's just you're gradually. Changing your comfort zone and opening it up from being restricted to substance use and opening it back up to other pathways and other opportunities which are less familiar and that's where the anxiety comes in, is having to do new things i'm just going to require effort. Right to to to know what it is, I know what this is, this is a panic attack because i've decided to go into the library and browse the books. And then you, you know you might have to sit down outside and slowly breathe through the panic attack read in and breathe out or go into the bathroom or whatever, and then go right back into the library and look at the books. Or the movies, or the whatever. Use the computers, whatever they've got. Did you did your screen, please again, can you still hear me. yeah Okay, there you go. So around that store where you go with team Lee what else is there in the vicinity. places."
11028.0,Patient,Nothing. versus a store. there's nothing really like. Nowhere or accidentally get to without an accord.
408.0,Provider,we've had a motorcycle is it working.
11028.0,Patient,yeah but. Early can drive on the road cars already got to drive all suspended tickets.
408.0,Provider,"I think, but say you're walking to the store."
11028.0,Patient,to drive my motorcycle.
408.0,Provider,"Oh, see ride the motorcycle to the store when you walk out the door of the store and look around, what do you see."
11028.0,Patient,How a couple houses.
408.0,Provider,Can.
11028.0,Patient,And the main writer and. that's it and I. live like about a mile or two away. From sort NASA closest store there used to be a store right but it burned down or some.
408.0,Provider,Right.
11028.0,Patient,it's just like a part of store now.
408.0,Provider,Parts store.
11028.0,Patient,"You have like parts, for your car or."
408.0,Provider,"Alright, so there's the store where you get your groceries it sounds like you ride the motorcycle there when you walk out the door from there you look around you see some houses and then there's the parts store, but you can't see it from the store, we were just talking about. That right. it's not the same. street Okay, so what else is on that same street."
11028.0,Patient,Just a bunch of houses. it's a bunch of houses.
408.0,Provider,Your gas station.
11028.0,Patient,"There is way past that first door. But I can't run that's like out in like the main little town there's like a little there's a gas station and then there's a red light and then there's like a tutors biscuit world that's like a letter, where you go in and he has a pizza place like attached to it. And then on down is like a guy Mr. Family dollar."
408.0,Provider,Okay.
11028.0,Patient,"The post offices across the street from that in the Bank is beside that. there's a Chinese place to across from the beats advice at the intersection and then there's a big lane right there's a. And then there's a pharmacy right, I take exception to and. Then there's another hardware store to right here. there's like probably five or six churches around here. Okay purchase. there's a skating rink. I used to go when I was little."
408.0,Provider,roller skating.
11028.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,You haven't been back.
11028.0,Patient,i'm not interested arrested.
408.0,Provider,Okay.
11028.0,Patient,All little kids go there yeah.
408.0,Provider,"and none of those places have any part time jobs, you can take."
11028.0,Patient,"A. na have tried, but. This just everybody already has like oh. People they."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, any volunteer opportunities in that vicinity."
11028.0,Patient,Not.
408.0,Provider,The Church at the church at the skating rink.
11028.0,Patient,"not really I don't know what they would do that unless it's like money I excuse give them money, I guess."
408.0,Provider,"Well, some churches run food banks, you know. Right, especially during the pandemic they a lot of churches have been handing out meals, you know for children and they sometimes. recruit volunteers to help with the assembling the meals, or the activity bags for children that kind of thing."
11028.0,Patient,yeah I don't know what when they do that or not.
408.0,Provider,yeah you'd have to actually go into the churches and check them out yeah. Or maybe you know go to one of their activities or events and just sit and observe for a while.
11028.0,Patient,yeah.
