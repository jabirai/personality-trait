740.0,Provider,Now that's the part I have you on.
14567.0,Patient,Okay okay.
740.0,Provider,"with several of you. I have been I have mostly worked in the population is supposed to be so Okay, so I will saving gear. So i've seen it all i've heard it all the excuses the justification, the Nice, I came to kind of stuff so i'm not i'm not i'm very, very. versed when it comes to stuff with you so, therefore, that is something that we will work on. Will will will work on the coping skills as well for the mental health symptoms and then we'll also work on the custom fields for the alcoholism, which you, which was some people actually realize is that they can link the one in the same. So when one is under control, the other one would be under control. Oh yeah you want to move one is out of control than that, other than to be out of control. yeah so we'll we'll try to will work on them both cohesively. and try to keep them both on the control. yeah Okay, let me ask you this, do you want to stop drinking or no. Yes, okay. And why do you want to stop drinking."
14567.0,Patient,"Oh God for. All the reasons, all the reasons i'm. can't afford another to you i'd really rather not lose control of my car and kill people i'm also it's going to ruin my health it's my teeth are already like ruined it's just a matter of getting them replaced. I lose my job, I will lose everything I will I will be like horrendously and hopelessly like in withdrawal from alcohol at all times and it's terrible and you do want to die and. I don't want to keep doing that I don't want to do that, like three or four times a year I just I don't want to do that."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so right now we got three weeks plane, which is awesome. that's amazing. um Have you ever considered one a I mean going to be going to a."
14567.0,Patient,"Oh Sorry, I guess, I should have done all the treatments. Oh yes. hey and start recovery."
740.0,Provider,Did you have a sponsor a doing a.
14567.0,Patient,I did I did.
740.0,Provider,Did you uh.
14567.0,Patient,huh.
740.0,Provider,Did you didn't make sure what the steps.
14567.0,Patient,"Yes, a little bit. um. yeah you can you can imagine what it's like all of the indoctrination and like being forced to go to church and stuff."
740.0,Provider,yeah you won't understand.
14567.0,Patient,But I gave it I gave it the College try.
740.0,Provider,"yeah well if you gave it a try, I can understand, I can understand it okay well what we're going to do. um. I guess I need to do my own homework and regard regards to finding other support groups. They support alcoholism outside of as."
14567.0,Patient,"Well there's recovery, but i've been to that and I wasn't that impressed. You know. Having been in the mental health can be for some time, like, if I could point to one single thing that's helped me the most it has been individual counseling. Like I I don't love group therapy, I know that's another part of this, so you know. i'm just jumping in and doing everything but. Individual therapy, has been the best for me."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, great well, I mean we all know, right right. So. This i'ma tell you a little bit about myself. Like I said I have done stuff with you for the past 20 years almost um. I am a very, very, as you can see, probably somewhat a little bit, I am a lawyer, I am animated type person."
14567.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"I believe the treatment should be very, very interactive I believe that it should be fun. Division be dark and gloomy and sorrowful and stuff like that I know, sometimes we will have those patients to where we will have to dig deep. And that's all and that's all well and good right. yeah no. I think the livelihood of each individual person that I talked to very, very seriously very seriously. And so, if alcoholism is something that you want to learn how. To some, be stopped and to stay stocks, and so what we focus on if learning how to manage and cope with those bipolar symptoms, is something that's very important to you then there's something they will focus on. And so, if you have anything else down the road when we're doing therapy, if you have anything go, so you like it, and I just I realized that I need to work on this too. yeah then feel free. editing when you want to. write and then we'll work on that I think these two right here. Is a lot. So we can work on those and what I say is a lot, I mean that we can do a lot with it. We can do it, so I look forward to working with you miscarry. I think every fun."
14567.0,Patient,I feel like we will interact well i'm.

So, and then we just grow together."
14567.0,Patient,"All right, um I actually like that you're not like you know significantly older than me and since then my mother, because I don't need that stuff."
740.0,Provider,Now I must be significantly younger than you.

Alright, never do I plan to be perfect, neither do I claim to be experts on that. Has a shot to learn as I go. I have a little experience what I got a long way to go, and so we're going to do i'm going to do the best that I can to make sure that I give you the best possible treated as possible and, like I said, preferably your work. Hopefully we got to do it we're gonna we're gonna make her happy, but guess what we care. Long long we both had the manifest the work they do work."

14567.0,Patient,I got you so. I just have one question. Like are you seriously asking people that are at home to put out their cigarette when they're talking to you.
740.0,Provider,"is just the roadmap care i'm Kelly, if the road. If the room I listen, let me save them whatever you're doing your half day job is i'm just saying like even doing group I went over my roof roof, one of the group rules that you can smoke one group."
14567.0,Patient,wow.
740.0,Provider,"So, because all the reason why is this even though it's virtual, but we still have to treat it like a therapeutic fishing. You know, in my office you wouldn't be allowed to light know cigarette in my home. And so, since you are on zoom. With me and we're doing therapy that your quote unquote still in my office. And so therefore we're treated as if you will give our office. And so, in my office you wouldn't smoke same thing."
14567.0,Patient,alright.
740.0,Provider,"So I know look at cost you by surprise, I know what it just thought of the room, so I appreciate you so much, and look forward to seeing you next time have a great week okay. You too bye bye."
