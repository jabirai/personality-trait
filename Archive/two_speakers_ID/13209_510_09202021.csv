If you're still thinking along those lines."
13209.0,Patient,"she's anything but I will tell you one thing that i'm starting to cut you off, but. i've been sick for the last three days. Okay, the only thing that makes me feel better is if I take another drink."
510.0,Provider,"Well, I wonder if you're also going through withdrawals, because you you. admitted your. Daily drinker."
13209.0,Patient,"So I thought yeah you're right it's not a hangover it's a withdraw. yeah I. don't know what what drove me, but I know what it means for other drugs."

13209.0,Patient,Drugs like heroin and stuff. Good I guess it's the same softball.
510.0,Provider,"mm hmm and alcohol actually can be pretty dangerous, I think I remember from our initial intake you have never reported having a seizure. After stopping drinking Is that correct that's one of the biggest risks that people have is they they're at risk for seizure activity remind me George Have you ever had a seizure."
13209.0,Patient,Good my headphones.

510.0,Provider,"puppy Palace okay okay um okay well let's let's break it down, I want to kind of review what common withdrawal symptoms are but I. First, want to know, George when when was your last drink. Can you tell me. Because I don't you know that's that kind of gives us information based."
13209.0,Patient,or two minutes ago.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right now prior to that when I was the drink prior to that."
13209.0,Patient,Now the 45 minutes.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so you when was the longest period that you've had without a drink in the past three days that you said you're."
13209.0,Patient,From yeah from Friday Saturday. Friday night. Saturday morning. I wasn't able to swallow anything. Until. until Saturday morning.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm gonna just really quickly go through some common withdrawal symptoms and I want you know I know you're thinking you have co bed, but you're also trying. to quit alcohol and so things could be really blurred that's why I was asking you have you indeed had a coven test because i'm wondering if you're going through withdraw so moment."
13209.0,Patient,i'm sure sure.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, did you have a question."
13209.0,Patient,"No, no."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so the most common withdrawal symptoms and these can start to occur, like five to six hours your last after your last drink okay so anxiety. People often feel anxious like their heart rate is increasing, and they feel anxious shaky hands headache nausea vomiting some people vomit in these doesn't mean you're going to have all of them, but these are the most common insomnia, where you are really struggling to kind of. Be cosine and sweating those are your most common what, if any, through that list are you experiencing any of those."
13209.0,Patient,"insomnia, and sweating but, even though I have my ACR 24 seven. Central AC because a lot of money. But now that the under the. I don't really. I don't really get too much of your symptoms."
510.0,Provider,"Okay okay and that's actually that's a good thing, I mean those are mild withdrawal symptoms, that I was describing now the really serious ones like I had mentioned these can happen 12. To up to 48 hours after your last drink I don't know if you've had that time period that's when people can definitely have seizures people can report hallucinations which mean like visual and auditory which."
13209.0,Patient,i've been i've been locked up.
510.0,Provider,When were you like a detox.
13209.0,Patient,"No, no, no don't do close the. couple sentences I served a couple sentences Mesa."
510.0,Provider,Are you talking about legal.
13209.0,Patient,"Was I went to jail. Okay, for about a you one time and then one time, well, it was it was 365 days a lead me about 180 days than the other one was two years I got out 100 and. I got out with the year and two months and I had to do another two months in."
510.0,Provider,"Legal Oh, I was okay."
13209.0,Patient,It was a. Because just to read it wasn't like for drugs used to rehab me into society.
510.0,Provider,Okay.
13209.0,Patient,It was like.
510.0,Provider,more like a mental health.
13209.0,Patient,"there's, no, no, no, no, it was a federal prison because I had they had a rest of me with the."
510.0,Provider,So it was a legal base facility it wasn't mental health or.
13209.0,Patient,"No, and then they were right, I drinking new school in ruin my life. Okay, honestly, I went from owning like that to BMW Mercedes. or wrangler for all these neighbors hated me because Mike right so many cars parked outside and we still had the I had my in my old drivers, for we had a boat. Where I was doing nothing illegal but uh at the end of the day. You know, this is what it is."
510.0,Provider,"Do you attribute this to like a consequence to your alcohol abuse. Do you blame it on you do so, you recognize due to your alcohol abuse, there were these very significant consequences okay okay. And I think that's why maybe I mean I say, maybe you were the one who shared it on that person take like what's the goal here, and he said to quit drinking. So i'm glad last week, I was really pleased to hear that you were open to talking with shauntel so I really hope, I mean she can't force you to schedule an appointment I can't force you, but I. I really just want to acknowledge, because I know how difficult that must be, because I know you shared you just wanted to quit and just do it on your own. And it's not a character flaw George a lot of people struggle with cravings. and urges to us, and sometimes medication can help it doesn't mean you're less than it doesn't mean you're a failure just means you're now open to getting some additional help that might prevent you. from continuing to drink, because I think you're recognizing you're having a hard time controlling it is that fair to say. yeah Okay, because I, I also thought of this, I want to share my screen with you, if that's Okay, this is a I did this back many months ago in my group and you hadn't yet joined bright heart, but I want to show you but sorry about that hold on. Let me move. That down. I always see that see that. And this is Have you ever heard of this, the stages, or the cycle of change. it's very common in the substance abuse world's."
13209.0,Patient,"Well, no."
510.0,Provider,"No okay um I i'd like to go through this with you, if you're open to it just to sort of give you some vocabulary and. content I smoke a cigarette. Okay Okay, if you feel like you have to. I wanted, I wanted to give you some vocabulary and give you the opportunity to sort of see where. You think you're. At on this cycle change. Now, this can be used in general, mental health terms but it's very common in the substance abuse world and so everyone starts out at pre contemplation there's no intention of changing behavior meaning this that when someone's in pre contemplation they're like I don't have a problem. They have no other like i'm not changing my behavior i'm not looking to do anything i'm."
13209.0,Patient,pretty much.
510.0,Provider,"yeah that well they're pretty much unaware that our problem exists right until you can acknowledge it what Why do anything about it, if you don't even think there's a problem so that's what we call pre contemplation. Now the second phase, and the cycle is called contemplation, and this is where the person becomes aware, there is a problem, but has made no commitment to change so they're they're able to at least say. yeah there is a problem, but not backing it up not ready to take or outline Okay, these are the things i'm going to do that's that's that's contemplation part of the cycle. The third one if we keep going down is the preparation, this is the person is has a really strong intent on taking action to correct the problem. So this is where you start to see some of those next steps and those you know scheduling appointments getting enrolled in therapy going to a like they start setting those things up, maybe setting up an appointment to talk about medication so. In part of this is the client is recognizing that change is potentially going to be a good thing they're seeing okay these strategies, hopefully, will help me. make a positive change around the problem number four is where you are walking the walk the Act, the act of modification of behavior that basically means. You said there's a problem you decided to take steps to address the problem now you're starting to do it, meaning you're taking medication you're attending therapy, you are. starting to reduce or completely not use drugs, alcohol, whatever the substances. So that's the action stage that's the next one of the cycle is maintenance, this is where you sustain the change the new behavior is replaced by the old behavior and in this like your case it would be not using any alcohol at all and you're in this maintenance phase where you're continuing. The new behavior now relapse We know this is a part of the substance abuse world now there is a percentage of people who say okay i'm going to quit drinking or i'm going to quit using xyz. And they walk away and they don't have a relapse for many, many years or at all, but we know we put this in here because we recognize that a lot of people go through a relapse part of the cycle of change and they fall back into old patterns. But if you look in the middle, do you see this upward spiral. That is where each time a person goes through, they go through a cycle and maybe they do indeed have a relapse. They actually have they build upon the relapse right I don't know if you've heard i'm trying to think, specifically in our group on Tuesdays Is anyone described this and maybe not. But it doesn't just because you have a relapse doesn't mean you're back to square one, like you've you know completely lost all hope. It just means that yes, you probably go back to that the preparation or action stage, but you build upon your foundation does that make sense, does it mean you're completely back to square one. Does that make sense. yeah okay i'm curious where do you think you are at on this cycle of change for yourself George. We went through each of them i'm. Pre contemplation no intention of changing behavior can't even acknowledge, you have a problem contemplation aware of the problem, but no real commitment to make the changes. Preparation taking more steps to get the support action is actually walking the walk maintenance you sustain new behavior so because I don't think you're in maintenance or relapse so we're out of the first four, where do you think you fall."
13209.0,Patient,throwing up for the last three days.
510.0,Provider,yeah.
13209.0,Patient,I haven't ate anything for those two days. So I don't know her phone to school.
510.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I think I mean you could definitely be sick with co beds, or you also could be having withdrawal symptoms so. On. So what would help you possibly reach out to your medical provider. You have a primary care because i'm thinking, there are things that can help manage withdrawal symptoms."
13209.0,Patient,"No, but she didn't care when I told her I can't read, I really have have chest congestion might have really hard time breathing and she didn't care."
510.0,Provider,When was the last time you talk to your provider.
13209.0,Patient,Eight months.
510.0,Provider,Eight months ago okay how about recently how about calling her now are going to an urgent care.
13209.0,Patient,"shimmy shimmy are okay, well then, about a good. photo."
510.0,Provider,"yeah I mean George if you're having a difficult time breathing i'm going to absolutely refer you to an urgent care and or the er right. And you're having all these other symptoms, I think it's time to seek out medical support what is, what is your level of investment and doing that it clearly you're not feeling well and i'm not a doctor I can't diagnose you it's time to get in front of a medical provider at this point."
13209.0,Patient,attorney until I told my my my provider that i'm diabetic or you need to you know I need to get my shots quick and she didn't care. When I told her chest congestion didn't care.
510.0,Provider,"i'm not. i'm not disagreeing with you and i'm sorry you felt she's not responsive and taking steps to figure out that was eight months ago you're currently reporting symptoms. So, what are you willing to do now, I can't force you to go to the urgent care or er, but I am highly suggesting that you do, what will what's the plan here George, what do you think you are are willing to do at this point."
13209.0,Patient,To get those pills.
510.0,Provider,What pills.
13209.0,Patient,For to give me high. Up me for getting rid of the craving for boom.
510.0,Provider,"So you certainly can schedule an appointment shauntel, but if you are endorsing difficulty breathing not sure how comfortable she is going to prescribe that so. In the immediate sense I really think you need to consider going to urgent care er, you have the option of calling your outpatient provider, but if you don't think she's going to be responsive like she was eight months ago. Then, those are your your other two options do you have an urgent care near you."
13209.0,Patient,"well. I do, and my my dad's. My dad's cousin those. Doctors I could, if I could just."
510.0,Provider,"I mean, I want you to get on shontelle schedule, but if you're telling me you're having a hard time breathing and you know I I need to."
13209.0,Patient,"Turn didn't have it, and there are a lot older. And they didn't have any kind of symptoms and i'm i'm having the worst is."
510.0,Provider,"All different well and we don't know if it's George we really don't know if it's comin unless you've had a test. Nor do we know if this is more alcohol withdrawal related right, it could be both it could be a combination, so please don't don't minimize."
13209.0,Patient,"timing, I know I know. For years, so. But my."
510.0,Provider,Other one for years.
13209.0,Patient,The alcohol.
510.0,Provider,Alcohol OK OK.
13209.0,Patient,So the other one is just different because I can't. I can drink I drink a bottle of water. Without without having to stop and take a breath of air and continue drinking again.
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah I mean. I just kind of weird triple well you're again i'm not medical so I need to make sure that I refer you on to medical so you can get checked out but i'm not getting a strong sense that you're willing to do that so. Up to.
13209.0,Patient,I did a I did lose my smell and taste.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13209.0,Patient,But again. It lasted about two weeks to me. Love a week from my fiance and three days from my pens. Which is pretty crazy. Like not all.
510.0,Provider,"I know, but everyone responds differently to code, but again, not all of those people are going through alcohol withdrawal either so."
13209.0,Patient,i've had those withdrawals for years.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm okay.
13209.0,Patient,i'm jealous for 15 years.
510.0,Provider,"Well, so what it, what are you willing to do, I guess what's your next step at this point because I won't see you, and so our last session till next Thursday, so what."
13209.0,Patient,"what's your next step, we have a class tomorrow oh yeah I mean i'll see you for group and i'm talking for one to one. I want to get I want to get something I want to get some medication."
