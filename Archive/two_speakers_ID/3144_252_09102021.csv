3144.0,Patient,Can you hear me okay.
252.0,Provider,Use the restroom. What is happening.
3144.0,Patient,"I feel like a lot of. explain it. Or, I guess, I don't know how to generalize just really shitty, I guess, or at least for me, but um. I know the last few weeks i've been kind of like depressed and like really stressed out overwhelmed feeling burnt out with work and everything and. Over the weekend on Saturday Kevin kevin's buddy Danny he had a party at his house and like a like a Barbecue. i'm. Danny he has like a girlfriend whatever it's technically her house, but you know he lives there and. Originally, I didn't even want to really go to the party, because I could really sense that danny's girlfriend does not like me for some weird reason. Either I get along with a lot of people or there are mostly girls that are like jealous of me, for some reason, like there. I don't know if it's a vibe I put off or if they're just like that themselves or something like that, where they're just jealous but um. yeah I think it was. Saturday was more of like afternoon. I woke up pretty late like around 11 or 12 in the afternoon and. I was up for about an hour, so I was trying to get ready. or trying to wake up and I have my coffee and I took my medicine and. Kevin asked me if I was going to get ready, and I was like ready for what and he's like for the party and I was like and not really feeling up to it and. kind of like gave me some attitude like why, and I was like well one my back hurts and I don't really feel like being like soulful or anything like that, like I just don't feel like. Taking a shower putting on a little bit of maybe like it's just a big old process and it takes me hours and already woke up super late and I just wasn't really feeling up to going. And he, like he was like upset or whatever, and he was like well if you change your mind i'm going to take a nap like a 30 minute nap and when I wake up i'm going to get in the shower So if you decide to come with or. Go with me to this party you better hurry up and get ready, because once i'm done i'm leaving kind of thing and. As much as I didn't want to go, I felt like obligated to go not like he forced me, but I just felt like he. really wanted me to go with him, so I got ready and. Of course, it took me away longer to get ready than it normally well, not even normally would but for me it's kind of difficult for me to be kind of late to things but and. So we go to the party. And I was kind of like keeping my distance everything was fine and. A couple hours in everybody else was like hanging outside and they're like drinking and I don't know just talking and stuff and I was just sitting inside, you know with our son. Just me and him watching TV, you know, like something like some kids YouTube thing and banning comes inside and he's like do you wanna play cards against humanity and almost like. he's like Come on, you usually like you always beat everybody anyways did you got like jokes or whatever so. I felt, you know. Okay, fine i'll play the stupid car game, whatever so I go out there and everything is all fine everything everybody's all drunk and everything and Danny whenever he drinks he gets like really, really drunk like. kind of embarrassingly drunk i'd really feel like he's an alcoholic but I don't know. He. Like walked away, and it was like his terms for the cards, have you played cards against humanity before. That okay so yeah it was his turn and everybody was like putting their cards in or whatever, and he just kind of like walked away because he was drunk and just like. Not in the same world as everybody else kind of thing so since I had his cards and he was like sitting right next to me, I was like Okay, I guess i'll just read it, read the cards well. right before I read them because I was still waiting for everybody else to like put their cards down danny's girlfriend like went to go. Do something I guess she went to go grab them or be with him and. A few minutes went by and i'm like reading the cards off and like both her and Danny they like sit down and. Reading off the cards and then she gets all upset with me and she's like I should be the one reading those cards like just a lot of Stupid drama shit and. The other few parts that I had I just kind of like sat him down, and I was just like i'm not gonna blow up because this isn't my house and like you know. You know, whatever like I kind of brushed it off, but I was still kind of upset about it, but I just kept it inside. and When I went inside to go sit with our son and just kind of separate myself. You know Kevin he continued to stay outside, and never really he never came inside you never like talk to me, or like hey how's it going I was kind of stuff but you know, like a couple hours went by and he. I forgot what he said. pretty much brought up the fact that you know, like danny's girlfriend she's freaking crazy and he saw like how embarrassed I was or whatever of the situation and I was just like. Sure kind of thing, and he. He. He kind of like got like upset with me because of like my response because he. I don't know try to acknowledge that I was embarrassed or something I don't know and so. Little passport, but the stupid party thing. everybody else was like super drunk or whatever I sitting on the couch all said and danny's girlfriend she was like, why is there a hole in my wall and I kind of like turn my head on my what's what kind of like going on, like i'm my ears are open at that point, and she. was like freaking out because I was like it looked like somebody punched a hole in her wall which I mean yeah I would be upset too, but what felt like an attack was the fact that she said that. she's like er and Kevin they have to go like we have to leave or something and I didn't know she was trying to insinuate that I did it because I was upset that she brought up the whole stupid card thing or. If she was insinuating it was like my son that supposedly punched a hole in the wall or did something to the wall. Once she said, like Karen Kevin have to go, I was like that's it i'm done, I want to fucking leave let's go now like, I was super like upset. So Kevin was kind of bummed that we had to leave early because he wanted to like stay the night we even tried to. Well, he yeah he wanted to like stay the night, and you know, like we're kind of going back and forth about it and stuff but after that that's kind of that was like the last straw so we're on our way home driving and while i'm driving he's drunk at that point, obviously, and he. He told me not to park behind his car and I was like Oh, how come or why and that's like what really, really started, like the huge fight and. I guess it was like my tone, or something but pretty much it led to him. punching his truck like completely bloody knuckles our son was also in the car oh that's what it was, I was trying to pull out our son. And he was like I felt like he was like attacking me and I do feel bad, but I told him I was like I fucking hate you like get the Fuck out of my face like go away like I was super like upset with him and. he likes stormed off or did something and. I pulled out her son like that's what kind of pissed me off, is that he was like attack nano son was like right there. Again, like fighting in front of the kid that's. Not appropriate when it's not me and. I put our son in the bedroom and i'm trying to get him to go to sleep or whatever, and then all of a sudden, I heard like baby and I, I thought he was like smashing my car or something and I go out there and he's like like. his head was down like on his truck or something and I noticed that his knuckles were all bloody and i'm like if he really just punches truck like that's. Like I he's not like the angry aggressive person, but like a month or two, I told you like, through a beer in the sink, and that was just like super like i've never seen that kind of behavior from him kind of thing. But he proceeded to say that, like i'm a bitch and not i'm always i'm always a bitch i'm like he just called me a whole bunch of names and accused me of. always being sad and depressed and I just need to get the Fuck over it, and. he's done so much for me and. I come off as like very ungrateful or like selfish and like he just said, a whole bunch of shit and it's like. Like there's some things that he said, like when i'm. always a big i'm like i'm not always a bitch like i'm not always in a bad mood like I hate when he says, like you never do this you're always there it's like those are very big words that aren't true like that I don't really fully leave but. There are like some things that he would say that I can fully remember, but there were certain things that he was saying that you know, like moyes sad all the time or depressed or. Oh i'm always negative and when I come home from work i'm just i'm like mentally drained and draining like he just said, a whole bunch of crazy. stuff like he just. I don't know it's just a really freaking crazy night. So. there's that and then a couple of nights ago he. We kind of we were like almost done watching our show and back to go to bed, and I kind of like brought up to him. about us missing our appointment. And oh that's what it was, I was like sending an email to you and then also Sean as well, and I was talking about, you know, like rescheduling appointment and, hopefully, I can get an appointment again soon, and he. He asked me is like, are you going to bring up. About you know, like the other night, and I was like yeah he's like why and i'm like, why not that's exactly why we kind of need, like. Because we apparently it's not like we can have like some big event happen, and then, just like ignore it and not talk about it, like that's. i'm not okay with that and he was like it was embarrassing and I was like super drunk and I didn't really remember anything I remember bits and pieces and you know all this stuff and i'm like. that's kind of your fault, but at the same time, like i've always kind of heard that saying of. drunk drunk words or sober thoughts or something so. yeah it's just. been like very, very hard, like, I feel like I Oh, I remember a couple nights ago he was also saying that he. Think, he says, like I don't know what you want, besides like sex apparently I don't you know have sex with you often and you know I don't do this and I don't do that and i'm just horrible husband and. You know, all these stupid crazy things like things that i've never even said whether he interpreted, you know, in a certain way that's not my problem, I guess, but he. What did he say he said that he doesn't he doesn't like to be touched like he's not like a touching kind of person and that's why he doesn't really initiate sex and you know all this stuff and like. I can't remember if I brought the love language things, or if he did and he's like I don't I don't have a love language i'm like we did that little test thing that's kind of funny because whenever he took the test it said. He was supposedly like you know physical touch with his thing and it's like he's the complete opposite of that it seems like in a way, but he. I don't know he was just being super like negative and it's almost like he. He liked a nice everything or he's like very dismissive them like a lot of stuff like I don't have feelings like it's like he's better than everything else, but at the same time he's you know closed off and like. I don't know."
252.0,Provider,he's not wanting to admit and he's not willing to let his guard down to be able to discuss these things.
3144.0,Patient,"I even told them that. I want him to be like more open, or like more vulnerable. And he was like Oh, you want me to like cry and be all super emotional and you know. pretty much like how he was the other night work, he was just being super open and like really telling me how he feels about me kind of thing. And I was like I want to feel close to you like, I need connection with you, I can't just. We can't just be living in the same House like almost like roommates that like occasionally will like have sex or like touch each other, and you know, like, I felt like we were doing so good for so long and then like I feel like i'm. Usually the one that will put in all this, like effort to doing things and like I don't see that kind of effort from him but. anytime I asked him like like, for my birthday, this weekend I asked him I was like what do you have planned for my birthday, a room like. He just doesn't know anything he's not creative he's like he seems like he just sucks like he doesn't want to be with me and it's hard to get it through his head of why I think that. yeah he tells me I love you and I do everything for you and I have your bag and better yet like I just I don't leave him because his actions don't match with those words."
252.0,Provider,"Right right. And so, did you get another appointment."
3144.0,Patient,yeah we did for. September 21.
252.0,Provider,that's a long time away.
3144.0,Patient,"But. I think that they were well I know the care navigators I think they were able to get like a different appointment, but it was like. Either at 10 o'clock or two o'clock and i'm like we can't can't really do that, like we're working. yeah and it's not like I could just step away for like an hour or two or us like I, I think that we could do like a three way kind of like how we do with group but. You know who knows what kevin's doing like at work for what he has to do at work and same thing with me too it's hard to step away."
252.0,Provider,yeah so. yeah oh my God the 21st.
3144.0,Patient,"yeah Sean did say that she wanted me to like having a play with you, and because I. I guess. vaguely kind of brought something up to her, I was like there was a situation that happened and I want to like. schedule an appointment as soon as you can get us in as long as it's in the evening kind of thing and I don't know she took the way that I said it, as in like. Just me and her like a one on one thing or. If maybe I just missed read her message, but I just told her, I was like I know it's not appropriate to exclude my husband from the conversation, but I feel like we need to have like. an appointment soon, so I think she meant like just me and her. Soon yeah and then exclude him and i'm like no not that way met me all three of us need an appointment soon."
252.0,Provider,"And if it's something you know, personal or it's something, you know that happened, you know, like. You know, like his behavior with beating on the truck where is this coming from. This behavior that he's never displayed before. Where is it coming from why now is it coming out after so many years of being together. You know Those are questions, you know that you should put up. You know, in your session it's uncomfortable it instills fear. And it's not okay. You know there's that right. That has to be laid out on the table. Why is this coming out now, and you know I would feel if I were in your situation I would feel exactly the way you do. Your words aren't matching up with with what you're telling me. You know, and everything that you brought out when you were drunk the other night. You know what I mean let's talk about that and dissect that tell me that's how you really feel. And again, how can I, how can I believe that you love me when all of that there was not one nice thing in there. You know."
3144.0,Patient,"I I feel like every time that I try to bring something up to them, or like you know how I feel he always does, that thing where it's like he turns it around like back on me whether he. gaslighting it's like yeah it's it's almost like he vaguely does it, but he It is like, and even then it's like i'm. Like I can't even tell if he's gaslighting me or not, because it's like it's so ugly like it's so minimal, but. it's like I can't tell if i'm the one last just sensitive and i'm like overthinking it and, like is he is he not but. whenever he says things he's like every time I try to be nice to you, and you know I do exactly what you say you want me to do, which I know he has done, at least, like years ago, you know, there are times, where he tries to be nice and I do get snappy with them, but. He like it's like every time I try to bring something up to him it's like will you do this or. Like I always tried to do this, not for you, blah blah blah, and you will shut me down and it's like I told him like yeah I understand that, like. I don't know I feel like it's back and forth back and forth it's it's like we're both kind of in the wrong in like certain areas and, like we have the right to feel the way that we feel, but at the same time I just feel like we're like toxic like we're. it's like horrible and, like, I of course I want our son to like grow up and especially with like fighting and screaming at each other, like that's not what. that's like exactly what i'm scared of for son is like I don't want them to like have like severe trauma or you know even like a little bit of trauma I know is going to happen here and there, because you can't control everything but. Like there are certain things that."
252.0,Provider,or believe that that's how the relationship is.
3144.0,Patient,"yeah exactly and that's what I try going through Kevin i'm like you know, like your parents stayed together. Even though your dad was beating on your mom and beating on you guys, but you know your mom still stayed with your dad and as much as me and Kevin the ups and downs, that will be pad. He still thinks like he's just always going to be with me like he. I feel like he. If anybody is going to be the bad guy he would rather have me be the bad guy than him, be the guy that makes sense, like he said that, like, I will always be with you, and like doesn't matter what you do like i'll still stay like. I know some people will like all that sounds very like fishy, I guess, but like no he won't but I really feel like he kind of would stay with me like he would rather let me decide if. We should actually get a divorce or separate like he would rather have me be the one believe. kind of thing. Right and. Even like that night when that happened. I even thought I was like I feel like I want to get out, but I feel like I have nowhere to go like I don't have any friends or like family that I could just. Go live with you know, or like stick around and then like of course sacramento is like really freaking expensive to just survive on and. Just feel completely stop."
252.0,Provider,Well there's always the alternative asking him to go stay with his parents for a while.
3144.0,Patient,"kind of thought about that. Oh, actually, I think a few nights ago I can't remember if it was that same night or whenever it was, but I know sometime this past week that he. even said that if I were to leave where would I go and I was like probably nowhere, or like in my car like I don't know and just him asking me that i'm like why, why are you asking me that, like I don't know I know I overthink things, but I feel like. it's like my subconscious or my intuition, or whatever it is, but it's like, why are you asking me that, like, I feel like he's. Like plotting things in his head or maybe i'm the one that's like plot and stuff for overthinking like I don't know I feel like I really can't trust him in any little way I don't know."
252.0,Provider,"well. there's fine line between love and hate. and love can turn into war right. um and so you wanted what you want to do for you is not engaged in the war. You know what I mean i'm not engaged in the warfare, because what happens is. When we're frustrated in a relationship, and you know the behavior our partners behavior repeats itself it's like. I can't communicate because it's always turned around on me they don't want to hear me right they don't want to hear what i'm trying to say, think about it, and then. Give me, you know, give a an appropriate response, what happens is the fighting put you both right on that edge so anytime that you say something you both are wrong. Right at each other right. um the situation with. What happened over at his friend's House should have never happened. He should have had your back 100%."
3144.0,Patient,"You know, like he should have at least said something in that moment he's he swore that he. Like said something or like tried to break the awkwardness or something like that, but I don't I mean people were like talking and like laughing and there was music, going so like I don't. I don't think I really heard him say anything but. I do know that when he was screaming at me, though, that night he. Like as he was saying, like all these hurtful things like those are the moments where. it's like I can't speak, or like I can't really almost like fight back or say respond but. it's like I like he was like bawling and you know really emotional and just. I mean, I could feel kind of like what he was feeling, but at the same time I just felt like I was like motionless emotional like I didn't have any emotions like I couldn't even cry like normally like. It I guess when i'm in a normal state of mind like if I see somebody crying like I feel super bad and i'm like, how can I like help, and you know, like, I feel like a lot of empathy or sympathy whatever it may be, but. In those types of moments, or at least with my husband. it's like i'm I turned into like a cold hearted bit or whatever, because I don't I don't really respond to him it's like I kind of. shut up or I mean I don't really know what stonewalling is, but I feel like I kind of maybe stonewall like when he does that, because he the way he was also. Saying certain things like I one particular thing that I remember is. He was like when I go out of town and I like work out of town i'm you know, making all of this extra money, and you know, because if we didn't if I didn't work all this. overtime, we wouldn't have the money for to pay for our food and like it's almost like trying to like guilt trip me about this overtime thing yet he went about a year without frickin overtime and. We still managed to manage to survive like it really wasn't that bad, but then again, I know, like be understanding like. I know i'm not the one that's actually paying each bill, you know it's so it's not like I really see where money is going and. Where it's getting pulled from and who's buying what, and all this kind of stuff like he does, but we still survive, we still managed, you know it wasn't that bad at least to me, but he. back to the original thing he said that. He was like do we have food in the House and I was like. At first I was kind of thinking i'm like we kind of. I know that we do technically have food in the House, but it's like we have dinner food not like French food, and I was like trying to think of it, because I know that in his head we don't have any food at all for him to eat or for anybody to eat, yet we technically do so. The way that he was saying stuff It reminded me of his brother, like the soup like stupid like manipulative narcissistic like. I don't know it it's really hard to explain, but it was like the way he was saying was like so. It was like controlling in a way, I don't know how to explain it, but I could just again it's like i've never seen him like that, before. And I think a few weeks ago, I told you how he said that I was like acting like his dad or his brother, like the way that I was. Oh, I was doing my I was trying to hurry up getting ready for we're trying to do my hair and the rubber band broke. And I got like upset because it broke, and I didn't have it in another frickin hair tie, so I like got really upset over it, and Kevin said that I have anger issues and then i'm acting like his like his dad or his brother, yet I feel like. Kevin. whenever he really like I feel like he really tries to not let his if he is an actual narcissist or not I don't know, but I feel like he really tries to not. show that side of him, because his brother definitely does it his dad does it and apparently kevin's the one that's not affected by stuff and he just gets over it, and that's what Kevin wants me to do is just get over it. Like I can't just get over stuff like he does, and I told them i'm like you're literally suppressing your emotions and that's probably why you're like."
252.0,Provider,"exploding when he's under the influence he's not he's just stuffing it that's all he's doing he's not addressing it as it comes, so he gets stronger and the all of this garbage comes out in an inappropriate way. Right. So it is like a volcano that happens, like our inhibitions are let down, you know there, everything is off barred and crap just tumbles out, you know whether we mean it or not, you know. There has, there had there's a core and there's a reason why he's feeling this way right, then you just can't forget that you can't forget the hurtful things that are said. Because he feels that way something situations that we that you guys have not talked about have made him feel this way. And so I wouldn't I wouldn't I would make him talk about it, I would tell him it had we have to talk about it. You have to learn to communicate with me not scream and holler at me but talk to me."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah or just brush it off like oh I just get over it, and then i'm done with it it's like no you're literally just. And then it's like anytime I try to bring up drinking like oh that's probably why you drink, you know it's like yeah I could, I know, like, I will met like it's probably like an attack towards him like. Oh no wonder why you're an alcoholic or oh no wonder why you drink all the time because you're you know you have to deal with me or something I don't know but. The thing when you were talking it popped up in my head of. How. He was like well, what do you want me to do. Well, when it came to the whole sex thing. I was like I just want you to have like initiate more sex like when we have sex like I feel more connected and like you know all this stuff and he was like whoa when are we supposed to do it, we have a kid now i'm like. The Times that our son is actually over at your parents House like there are times that we can do it and you say oh i'm tired get your store on your phone and you still. You know, like, I feel like he tries to avoid me, and of course it makes me feel so unwanted and like unlovable or unloved and I tried telling him that and. He was like well, what do you want to do planet and I was like probably should plan it he's like okay pick a date and a time then like the way that he said it was it was so like. I don't know like attitude it, but he claims that I do that too, like I attack him and i'm. You know. I get angry with him very easily and upset and all this stuff and like I do admit like I know that I like. Get upset easily or I get irritated. All this stuff but. I kind of joked about it, but at most it's also kind of serious or, at least for me that. I told her, I was like maybe if we had sex more maybe I wouldn't be such a bitch all the time, you know I don't know that's just me. I got to that. yeah I mean like i've heard that it like releases like stress relieving hormones or chemicals in your brain or outfits oxytocin or something but. I don't know."
252.0,Provider,And it makes you feel loved and it makes you feel wanted.
3144.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,which really you know that it's that intimacy you know that sexual intimacy that you're looking for you need to feel connected to your husband and there's nothing wrong with that.
3144.0,Patient,"You know, and there were a few weeks, like i'd say at least a month or so where we were like having sex like two or three times a week, which was like like that was like as much sex as we were having like kind of when we first got together kind of. thing and I felt like I was in a good mood and I was like perfectly fine like I didn't feel super stressed out like I felt like everything was fine like. Even between me me and him like I really tried to like calm myself down and like you know talk to them, and you know, like I didn't get so upset with him or even like our son or anything you know but. Again, he always says that nothing is ever good enough for me, so why should you try, or why should you do this and that like."
252.0,Provider,"How about. yeah that's a total COP out, you know you everything is good enough for you, but you want communication, you need to feel wanted in your marriage and when he's sitting on his phone and he's not. Giving the attention that he needs to it's easy to feel insecure it's easy you know to hold a resentment and and you know what I mean not being able to communicate with your partner it sucks."
3144.0,Patient,"You know, and I feel like he does have. He does have some resentment resentment towards, why is that so hard for me to say a lot of SS. pretty much I feel like he resents me and there are certain things that trigger him and. Especially like whenever I was using for so long, and like I mean I totally understand of like when you're an addict or you know druggie in his eyes when you keep that from like your spouse and you like hide it and don't tell them about it, or how you're feeling or whatever. And then, once you do find out about it, like, of course, like. That kind of like breaks trust and. there's like certain things it's like I know, but I always like admit to it, you know it's not like I brushed off right try to like turn around and push it back onto him there are a lot of times that like whenever he. Like the last few or probably this past week when he brings things up to me and he was like well you do this, you do that, like. I. try not to even like respond to it because it's like I mean I do respond, but I don't say I don't turn it around back on the him like he's I don't want to play this game is stupid game because it'll be back and forth back and forth, like, I just want us to be. Normal like not normal but back to our normal selves in a way, and yeah definitely better and. I feel like sex is like like as far as. I mean, I know it's not all about sex but that's my. My love language and apparently Kevin thinks that love languages are stupid because, how could you take a test in it tell you what your love languages and. You know, he apparently he doesn't have a love language and. And I told him I was like well. And I think that's what he brought up the whole. That physical touch thing and. I told them. That maybe the reason why he doesn't like being touches probably because he was like beaten or something I don't know. And he was like no that wouldn't that doesn't even make sense, I was like well to me that's literally physical whether it's you know, a broad term or also you being physically beaten to me that's like maybe why you don't like being touched. Right Either that, or some other type of trauma, I mean I didn't tell them that but. I don't know there's certain things where it's like correlated whatever and. He doesn't see it but. I feel like we kind of hate each other it's like when i'm in a good mood he's in a bad mood, but then whenever he's in a good mood i'm in a bad mood or. Whatever vice versa."
252.0,Provider,"What if you said to him when he pointed out, things that you do. Instead of no response, which is so wally right. How about you just say thank you i'll take a look at that. Nothing more."
3144.0,Patient,"I think if I were to say it he'd be like well, he would get upset because of probably my tone I think that's what he said is like. Like whenever I say why like apparently that triggered him and I was like how it was I wasn't even like I was even upset I was just asking you, why do you want me to pop behind you, who, and he liked frickin blew up but. He said it was my tone, the way that I set it and i'm like oh like I wasn't even like what like I was completely confused just because I said why."
252.0,Provider,He was drunk and he was ready and would have found anything. down in that moment. See.
3144.0,Patient,"How do I know that he wasn't upset with me at the party, because I walked away from him either I wasn't the one giving him attention or. I was the one that was starting stuff with you know his friend's girlfriend or something I don't know like because he won't tell me like he holds everything in. You won't communicate to me yet whenever I bring up the communication thing apparently i'm the one that never communicates or tells them anything, and all this stupid shit yet I feel like."
252.0,Provider,Your communication yeah that's like.
3144.0,Patient,The reason why I wanted to do couples. You know therapy or counseling. and
252.0,Provider,"that's exactly what it is. So. Knowing that you can't control anything with him right, you can have influence on you know his thoughts or beliefs, but. I want you to think first off investments are horrible. In are in recovery. being transparent is the best thing to do, as far as communication goes, and we have to you know, make sure that we're making I can't contact and that our tone is low. matter what our donors low so it's even so there's no pitches in it, so they can't say that you're yelling you can't say you're yelling you're talking in a normal voice."
3144.0,Patient,or giving attitude I guess.
252.0,Provider,"Right you just talking to normal voice and sometimes you know what I mean it kind of takes them off guard. Because you're not wanting to start a fight, you know. You want to communicate and when he tells you is try it when he tells you things that you do, I would just say thank you look at that. And just leave it monotone even tone no sarcasm in it whatsoever. Thank you i'm going to take a look at that. And you go and do whatever it is that you were going to do and that's what you say to him when he does that right. Because it'll start changing that's The hope is that i'll start changing or her flail a little bit and won't know how to handle it. yeah what it's about you getting off of that Defense right defend no more you have nothing to defend right unique communication, so if he's telling you that you're doing something Thank you i'll take a look at that. And you move on right. So, in his perception. right when he tells you these things you guys have already created this whole atmosphere of war, so when you tell him things that you would like to see differently he's a he gets on the Defense. And then he he turns around the terms of back around on you and then you get on the Defense and nothing gets accomplished."
3144.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know, so you want to. be able to get to the resolve keep your eye on the resolution. Right. Sorry that's a kitty. Keep your eye on on the resolution when communicating with them. Right what is that you would like to see differently. Right what's going on is that you both don't know how to communicate with each other and so it's like. Instead of thing right. Instead of breathing you're you're hurt over the things that he said the other night when he was drunk you have every right to be heard. yeah you know I would be hurt too. But if that's really what he thinks, then that really needs to be discussed in your family in your couples counseling you really think of me in that way and that i'm really that bad. You know I am hurt by the things that you said, we need to discuss it, you need to talk about it. I need to hear it. Because now you're not coming at them on a defensive way you're thinking of the resolution. What do you want to see happen. You know. And you're exactly right he does love you you guys been together for a long time, but when you guys are trying to make things better and it's turned into an epic fest it's easy for it to go straight into that anger mode. I would certainly bring up his two tantrums that he through. And really set a hard boundary down and let them know that that is not okay. it's not okay to be treated that way to talk to you that way. you're his wife you're a person. yeah it's behavior you've never seen before, so the concern is where's it coming from."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah I know it, because there's a lot of things that when our when we're in our session it's like i'll bring something up and then, once we're done with our session and come and be like well how come you never told me that you never brought it up to meet like it's like. it's almost like I don't know if it's trust or like i'm it's i'm too scared bring things up with him just. me and him because every time I try to bring something up and i'm the one that's trying to be calm and cool collected and all the stuff it's like and he says to me or saying that i'm the one that's i'm the reason that he did that type thing, like everything is my fault. Even though he says. I never said that are you know but that's The easiest way that I could kind of like sum it up it's like I feel like he's like I don't know it's like a freakin mind game, or something I don't know."
252.0,Provider,And you need he needs to hear that the reason why you don't bring things up to them is because you're afraid to.
3144.0,Patient,him.
252.0,Provider,"And every time that he acts in that manner, he throws his fit fit now has been twice get really deepens that fear. yeah you know you want things to be better in your marriage, the whole idea of you guys going to couples counseling is to learn how to communicate to hear what you don't want to hear. for you to hear what you don't want to hear and him to hear what he doesn't want to hear and find the resolution to make that marriage stronger and better. me. So that's definitely again I contact monotone right not uppity not sarcastic but thank you all, take a look at that. You know you won't know he won't know how to respond, because he's so used to you guys going back and forth and nitpicking at each other. Stop participating in the war. don't give him anything. To fight about if you say what and it's in a manner that he starts freaking out about you know walk away. I don't have to be treated this way, if you want to communicate with me when you're done we'll talk."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah I know that. In one of the days when we have I already said this or not, but. um he's like well, what do you want me to do like, how do you want me to make you. Like, how do you want to like fix us or whatever he said. I told him I was like I want you to like if. I know what it was he about the fact that i'm always like in a bad mood and I always lash out on him or whatever and i'm always stressed out from work supposedly and i'm like taking it out on him. And he's like how am I supposed to like handle that and I was like I mean, even with me it's like I don't know like. Try to make my it's not like i'm trying to say that it. He has to make me feel better like. I know he's not the one that's responsible to make me feel better like he can make me feel better that way I know that's like my responsibility, but. He should lose it lose it he. Should. start thinking about something else."
252.0,Provider,"You know. You coming home in a bad mood. Why can he walk up and just give you a hug and say hey baby I love you. give you a nice hub make you feel welcome to be home. We start the night out in that way, what you know you have a rough day today anything you want to talk about boy."
3144.0,Patient,"He has said that he was like yeah usually whenever you come home like if I asked you like, how was your day in your local. You know, it was horrible or whatever like that's me being negative, you know. he's like I always give you a hug and a kiss and you know, try to ask you, like how your day was or you know what you're doing or whatever, that is so, he is. He brings up the fact that he is trying to put in the effort and he is the one that's trying to make me feel better or whatever, but. Overall, I feel like he's like doing the very bare minimum, like just enough to like be like this, what i'm doing like I am doing that, but it's like. You know, just like with the sex thing or like I told him why don't you like you know touch me like more often, or you know, do something it's like he just barely does what he has to do in order to like I don't know keep me like from. You know I guess keep him from being. wrong. You know I don't know. you're just heard."
252.0,Provider,"That I lose you know, but that part that you just said was like it was just stretched out and I didn't hear it, but what I what I did get out of it was that he just does the bare minimum, to keep you. satisfied enough not to harp on it all the time."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah either that or. I don't know if you heard one, I said that he. Is yeah he does the bare minimum, but it's almost enough credits or enough. I don't know how to explain it now, but. It pretty much she just does the bare minimum."
252.0,Provider,So when's your birthday.
3144.0,Patient,Saturday.
252.0,Provider,"Have you thought about telling him. That you want. Something in in the realm of. One night you and him no kid but for him to come up with the most romantic. night for you to. That he can think of, and make it happen."
3144.0,Patient,"I feel like i've. asked him like even like, for my birthday is like a problem right now I asked him I was like do we have, like any plans for my birthday like did you think of anything or. You know I want him to be the one that's creative and he always will usually every year he asked me what do I want for my birthday in the last like couple of years, whether it's birthday Christmas. I told him like just think about it, like we've been together for so long, like you should be able to figure something else, like, I know that he can be romantic or very thoughtful and. You know, like he made me like that little edible arrangement thing for one year for my birthday or valentine's day whatever so it's like I know he has been there, but it's like he. it's almost like i'm such a shitty person that he just doesn't want to put the effort in to you know, give me that you know. But he. If I think if I if I were to actually, and this is probably me being negative or being me. If I were to bring that up to him or asked him to. come up with the most romantic night for us to do for for my birthday, or whatever he'd be like a room or to do it, no, no, I can't think of anything like. Because there's so many times that I asked him I was like how about you think of something like. That, I think it's because he's, so I think he's very discouraged because. Every time that he has tried to put effort into this or tried to do this and that. Apparently, nothing is ever good enough for me so it's like, why does he have to try, you know so it's like I think he in a way he's kind of scared to do stuff we're. scared or or discourage. me we're not necessarily scared but discouraged to really do anything for him, because he know he doesn't want me to be unhappy bad or something like that I don't."
252.0,Provider,"Do when he does things that you want them to do when he does things that are good that are where you see that effort, even if it's the minimal effort, do you praise him for it."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah i'm especially like since we've been doing our therapy, I mean there are times, where like I don't say anything or. The last thing that he did, which was a few weeks ago. He did clean a toilet I don't know if I told you, he did clean the toilet like what the brush but he pissed in the toilet and then took the toilet brush and clean the toilet with the pistol in the toilet like did you flush the toilet first. And I admit I did freak out i'm like what are you. Doing that's disgusting like I admit that I blew up on him, but when he does the dishes like just. Without even me asking I don't like thank you for doing the dishes or, thank you for picking up the living room Thank you like, I try to make it an effort, because. I know that's important, even if it is a shitty job that he does something I would rather and i've even told him this I was like i'd rather have you do a quote unquote shitty job and his eyes are currently my eyes. I would rather have him do half assed job I guess then not even put in effort to do it, but at the same time. I don't want him to think that i'm Okay, with him, doing half assed job I don't know if that."
252.0,Provider,makes sense yeah but. um yeah I was just thinking that if you're praising him for what he's doing and putting the effort in that maybe that would make him want to do it more you know. You would think like like a kid.
3144.0,Patient,"yeah. No and that's what I thought. too I won't like when he does the dishes like. I can't remember the last time he has done the dishes there's been I think the last two or three times he's like attempted to do the dishes he. Literally filled up the water and just put up like getting rich off the dishes I didn't even say anything about him not rinsing the dishes off, I was like whatever I don't care as long as they get done I don't want to do them kind of things, but. He just started the water put a whole bunch of dirty dishes in it and then just left it sitting there for two three days like didn't even touch it. Like and then I end up having to. drain that water and then read wash all those dishes. So. i'm gonna i'm not gonna say thank you for starting the water and i'm leaving the dirty dishes in there, because one."
252.0,Provider,Right not really thankful.
3144.0,Patient,"yeah. But I did try to bring it up to one. One of the last times and then after that he hasn't even even attempted to fill up the water anymore like he's. Again him turning things around on me, he was like I do. I try cleaning up all the stuff outside and mow the lawn and you want me to help out inside, but I also work, and you know. You know all this stupid shit and i'm like I want you to help out inside of the House like you know, doing the dishes or the laundry like. To me it's just a lot of mental loan stuff I guess I don't know like I shouldn't have to tell him hey. Can you please clean, this can you please take out the trash even though it's clearly you know needs to be taken out. Like I don't know."
252.0,Provider,That.
3144.0,Patient,He turns around.
252.0,Provider,"A lot of time, you know a lot of guys were like that, like they. They don't get it it's almost like they're missing the mark, you know. If you just take out the garbage if you just pitch in without me having to say anything."
3144.0,Patient,hmm.
252.0,Provider,"it's going to be more to me than if you make me ask you to do it, or we have to bring it up, you know our relationship is 100% 100% right. Which means you know, there are things that that happened in the House or things that happen outside when he's out of town you're taking care of the animals outside. You can point that out to him, you know you're out there, doing what he's normally doing because he's not able to do it and you're there and you're doing it not complaining about it you're doing it. You know so. You just want the same respect inside. You know."
3144.0,Patient,"Another thing is that I don't why don't even know if I can pull explain it to you the right way, but. I feel like. And this is just like honest like thing I feel like if he acted better or if he. was a patrol thing of me, but if he did things the way that. I wanted, or if he acted better or. Like if he was on his best behavior, then I think that I would be more willing to be or I would be on my best behavior. That makes sense, like if he's in a good mood, then I want to be in a good mood to, but if i'm already in a good mood and then I talked to him and then he's in a shitty mood of course that's going to put me in a shooting mood. So. I don't know I just feel like match each other's energies, but there are certain things where. Like how I said, like if I try to bring something up to them when i'm trying to be the one that calm or i've tried to be gentle then he's the one that's flipping out. But then, if I say why are you flipping out right now like, if I bring that up to us, I will you always do that, and you blah blah blah blah like it's I always feel like if, and again I think it's like that resentment thing if I do something bad. Then he has to do something bad to me, you know it's like a back and forth game."
252.0,Provider,"I would quit quit playing the game. You know quitting engaging in it. Definitely, change your response, you know to. to him telling you the things that you know that you're doing that you do, change your version wants to it right, we start changing those buttons the so called buttons that we have we start changing those and then it kind of throws the whole war off because we quit engaging in it. Right. and part of that is saying thank you for, for you know letting me know i'll take a look at it and then moving on to whatever it is, next you know. And even if you went back later and said hey you know, I was thinking about what you said. And you're right, I do do that so i'm going to really work on that. Thanks for letting me know. And you just completely change the dynamics right instead of you and him always being in a war right. You want to get out of the war. Completely get out of the war. Definitely, and so you've got to change those buttons and you know, remember that. Whatever is going on with him. is going on with him. You don't have to engage in it, you don't have to pick up his energy if you're in a good mood and he's in a bad mood you know you could say things don't like you know I hear that you're a little upset if you want to talk about anything later, let me know I love you. And just going to move on, so you're not engaging in that war back and forth, and then he's realizing that oh oh crap. You know."
3144.0,Patient,and
252.0,Provider,"So you changing those buttons a little bit and staying out of the war. One at a time, a little at a time, even though, even if it makes you mad and you want fun, you know. Read and remember don't engage in the war. Right, you know and see. If it changes anything. You know. My therapist tomita turtle."
3144.0,Patient,turtle.
252.0,Provider,"turtle up, in other words, build the shell. And so the things that he can normally get to get you. Going with him in that round about net nitpicking arena. A turtle It means that you go inside and you don't allow it to. Put you in that arena with that war. You just stand and listen."
3144.0,Patient,"I mean is that kind of like. kind of the same thing, like how I told you like, when he was like screaming at me and calling me all these names and. Like or maybe I was in shock I don't know, but when he was saying all that stuff to me I just felt like I was almost like numb like I was it wasn't really affecting me, but I feel like. After the fact like. Actually I think what it was once I started laying down and, like my brain was just like processing it or thinking about it. And I think that's when I started it like hit me like a. Making me feel like i'm a shitty person, and you know i'm the one that has. failed our marriage or cause such hurt in our marriage or something like that you know, but again it's like I always like every time when when when we are in our sessions, or even more, not in our sessions, like the big thing, like the phone you know. we're always on our phone and I always say, well, I know i'm always on my phone or I always do this or I always do that, but we both need to change like I always make it like a week thing I don't say you don't do this or you don't do that, and you always do this or never do that but. I don't."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and it's almost like you have to almost lead by example and change the wording, you know."
3144.0,Patient,"that's why I tried doing but or if I say. It wrong, I think, correcting him is something different, of course, I think that would piss them off, but."
252.0,Provider,"yeah very much so, I would just not again don't engage in the war. If he says that you, you know there's things that you need to work on and then. acknowledge it acknowledge what he's telling you tell him you'll take a look at it and come back later. You know, and if you don't feel that you do those things, I would say something like you know. I really thought hard about that and I don't see how I do it, so can we bring that up in our therapy sessions, so that. Maybe we can hash through it a little bit. You know, to do write it down so we don't forget about it. Totally right and what you're doing is you're now in in solution based thinking and behaviors you're not engaging in that warfare. Right, you need a truce. truce, but I would certainly if I were you care I would certainly bring up did you bring up his first santorum."
3144.0,Patient,I know I don't think I did.
252.0,Provider,"So yeah Do you remember me telling you if you don't address it, it will happen again. yeah and it's happened again. mm hmm so you've got to put it on the table. he's got to know that that's unacceptable behavior he cannot act that way to you or in front of your son. yeah that's that's abuse."
3144.0,Patient,"I also told him I was like. I told her, I was like I wish he had a therapist like I wish she could you know. Talk to somebody and you know because, like, I honestly have you as a therapist and i'm able to talk to you about. You know, like what's going on with me and how i'm feeling and then you kind of like help guide me through or kind of tell me what to do. In a sentence, and I was like you should have like a therapist or something like that he's like Why do I need a therapist I don't need a therapist there'd be nothing to talk about i'm like. I know guys are into their emotions and you know geyser and I asked about the thing like what you said, like girls are more emotional but guys are more logical or however it's worded but. I told I was like you need somebody that's. A professional and like relationships or. Teach you how to conduct knows how to. yeah like how to deal with things in a more like healthier way but also. not be biased. In a way. You know, because, like, of course, if you have a friend and you're telling them all this stuff it's gonna be like one sided, you know yeah it's like. that's why I always feel kind of bad in a way that like when I bring up things and. Well, I guess, like whenever I bring things up to you, and I say this, and that that up, but then whenever Kevin. He always says, all this negative shit about me but i'm like well Rebecca said that, like my my feelings are valid you know, like all this stuff like i'm not crazy or i'm not in the wrong or I didn't really do anything wrong, but then, when I have him it's like how do I know. That my story isn't like biased or I don't know if that makes sense, you know that's why problems like that's why we have like a couples. therapist or counselor whatever the wording is, but we need somebody, that is, the non biased that I don't know communicator. To help us."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so, and don't forget that there can there's always two truths to the same situation. your side in his side right, and so, in the middle in between finding that middle ground is what you're searching for. So you have to know that, so if he were to talk to his own therapist his side of things will probably be way different yeah you know what I mean that doesn't mean that his side is wrong, it just means that he's seeing it through a different lens. You know. and understanding that. i'm understanding that of course they're going to be different. And that's okay. Sorry. I don't have."
3144.0,Patient,"I just. I guess. Well, I wish I could just kind of like tone that. How I like tell you about like cuz he's even asked he's like you talk about being therapy, I was like Of course I talked about you in therapy he's like Oh, did you tell her this to detox you know, like trying to attack me or make me feel bad for talking about him, apparently, but. I wish that he had a therapist that. He could tell the therapist I guess about me like. yeah because I obviously have like my thoughts and feelings towards him, you know, like, I feel like he's a narcissist or a covert narcissist I don't know I feel like there's just something off about him. Or maybe it's just me not really trusting him, I mean it's probably both but I don't know, I just wish that he. Had somebody or professional person to talk to. You know by himself. But he was really you. can't force them."
252.0,Provider,"No, you can't force them but That just shows the unwillingness of him wanting to address. His own stuff yeah."
3144.0,Patient,"And I feel like if he. Had somebody like a more professional like they can help by them, you know, or like teacher matter communicator, and all this kind of stuff but again I still feel like it's one sided. Whenever I. I feel like I have a lot of like knowledge or something like that of how to deal with certain things but it's like he doesn't understand like what i'm getting at or."
252.0,Provider,"yeah you guys aren't on the same page as far as communicating goes and it gets frustrating when you guys, you know, are in alignment in that area. You know that's. Where resentments get built and we start holding things in because we're afraid to tell them right. Not just on his side, but your son to. them and having resentments is a risky area for somebody in early recovery well you're getting medium recovery you're not even an early recovery anymore you're a medium."
3144.0,Patient,yeah right.
252.0,Provider,"But it is a risky it's a risky place for us to be, and so you know even acknowledging that, with him, saying we need to learn how to communicate. Because what's happening is when what happened was that all these things that you don't know how to tell me came out in a very vicious way when you were drunk very hurtful. Instead of us talking about what's causing those those feelings in you, I just got the full bucket thrown on me and that's not fair. We should be addressing these things as they come up so you don't think i'm a bitch all the time, so you don't think you know all these negative things that you told me the other night. yeah you know. and see and again stay out of the war. turtle up. Okay."
3144.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm. Like building up. A wall towards him, I mean just even in general, like, I feel like I can't really. be close to him or like if he hugs me like I am so kind of like awkward hugging him or maybe scared or something I don't really know the feeling of it but. I don't know I just feel like I can't really trust them and i'm very cautious and. I can only want to really like open up to him or tell him how I really feel now of course there's times, where it's like now i'm scared to even tell him how I feel, because when I do it, he just you know either explode or be super defensive, you know."
252.0,Provider,"that's what an origami. that's what needs to be addressed when you guys are in therapy. yeah how am I supposed to feel safe how am I supposed to be able to tell you how I feel if this is what I get and because of all of the reactions that you've been getting now you're you feel closed, you know and you're in fear that it's pushing you guys farther and farther apart. You know. that's exactly what it is."
3144.0,Patient,"And I think like in the past, like how I was telling you that every time that like if I do something bad to him, and then the next time he'll do something bad to me and it's like a back and forth thing, I think that he's. kind of doing like what I have done, especially like in the past, where I used to kind of close myself off and, like everything that he's kind of doing. It seems like i've kind of done that, too, and it's like he's always trying to get back up who's like whoa whenever I was nice to her, and I did this, and that she acted like you know this, you know, like she acted very defensive or she. pushed me away so now i'm going to push her away because she's being nice to me I don't know if that makes sense, but. it's it's that back and forth notice that i'm talking about and but anytime that I try to like bring it up to them in a way, where. You know I feel like it's gentle or if it's vader that's right word, but he it's like he denies it he's like no I didn't know I don't have an issue with you know you are like everything's fine like. everything's peachy keen when it's not and I try to get that out on like. it's like. he's numbing himself out like and that's another reason why, like i'm like I feel like he's depressed but you won't like admit to it or. Again denies it he's very. In denial yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, and he he. He said these to learn how to communicate."
3144.0,Patient,them.
252.0,Provider,"Right so on your side, your Community communicating skills this week. Right, are going to be practicing mindfulness about your response about not engaging in the war. And you know when he does something nice for you, thank him from your appreciate it Okay, this is about keeping your side of the street clean, this is about doing things differently and not engaging in the in that warfare staying out of it okay. um if you sees in a bad mood you know you can say, I see that you're in a bad mood if there's anything you want to talk about let me know i'm you. and lead him to his bad mood if you're in a bad mood is so easy to say you know what I I had a really tough day today and I love you so if I say something that's all for if I if I say something that snippy just know it has nothing to do with you."
3144.0,Patient,"i've tried doing that to him out i've even told him like if he tries to like help me or tries to do something and i'm like. I it's like I stopped him and I told him I was like I don't want to lash out at you right now, like. Because I don't want you to get bought her or anything like that, but again it's probably my tone that's making them offended. offended, but I feel like I try to give him warnings that i'm not in a good mood and if I say that he's like you're never in a good mood like you're but, again, like. A lot of times whenever he tries to say, well, you do this, you do, that I feel like I just kind of like I shut up pretty much it's like i'm I feel like i'm not really engaging in his game like I don't want to play that game with him."
252.0,Provider,yeah I don't.
3144.0,Patient,I don't want to fight I don't want to fight so.
252.0,Provider,"yeah don't engage in the warfare, but you can respond, you know, thank you i'll take a look at that. You know. you're polite and you're nice you're respectful you know you're not stonewalling you're not ignoring you hear what he says they move on."
3144.0,Patient,them.
252.0,Provider,"This is about you, this is about your side of things, this is about making sure that you're being appropriate and that you know you're not. nitpicking you're not you know doing these things that help cause that friction. You know the things that need to be addressed. The aggression. sure. Right. And wanting communication solutions not fight some warfare. So you think about that don't engage in the warfare total up. Thank you, I think about that, thank you, I think that. You know. And it makes perfect sense that you're like pushing away a little bit you know things lately have gotten. When they happen you guys go along, good for a while and then all of a sudden something happens, you know it feels like each time something happens is getting a little bit worse every time something happens."
3144.0,Patient,yeah and I feel like I keep almost pushing myself away by more and more and more.
252.0,Provider,yeah that's a protective you know piece of it. and identifying you know when you guys are talking in in therapy was showing that. You know. Based on what he's told you that he doesn't feel heard and you don't feel heard. So how do we break this cycle.
3144.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know. We try it.
3144.0,Patient,"Definitely. Because I definitely feel like i'm not I feel like he doesn't understand me and i've even. Not I can't remember who said it, for, oh no he said it to me he's like I feel like I really even know you and i'm like I feel like I don't even know you like you. you're the one that's like closed off, and all this kind of stuff but he makes it seem like I don't want to close off so but."
252.0,Provider,"And it might be a little bit of both you know you're. Trying to you're trying to. do things different ends and really save your marriage you're trying to add. better communication being able to address issues and doing these things you know, so it may be that you both are a little closed off you guys are are trying to deal and talk about learning how to talk about the tough stuff together, and it can be tough. You know. and acknowledging that you know what given we both probably are are closed off some right now. When we need to get get past that, how do you suggest we do that."
3144.0,Patient,Great to him or two as Sean how to. Both.
252.0,Provider,"For both asked him to come up with you and between you and him before you see shawn I would ask him that. yeah you're right we, I feel that we both are shut off it's not just you it's not just me we both are right now. What do you suggest we do to fix it right. If he says, I don't know. Let me say okay Well, this is really something we need to break down and talk about in our therapy Okay, because I want a better I don't want it worse. Those are not anymore. You know they're not fighting words."
3144.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,Okay.
3144.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,So you try.
3144.0,Patient,"yeah, of course."
252.0,Provider,"alrighty you can do it, and I know you can. You just know that you know, sometimes there are tough times in marriage, but if you don't give everything that you've got to try to fix what's going on in your marriage now later on you're going to regret, if you just walk."
3144.0,Patient,down.
252.0,Provider,"And so you want to you want to give it 100% before you make that that's a huge decision. Okay, can."

3144.0,Patient,"Okay. And also one last question before we go. It. Is bright heart, or is there still that certain stipulation where it's like I have to be seen within our I have to be seeing every other week or twice a month at the very least reading otherwise i'll get out of compliance."
252.0,Provider,I think it's whenever we. Get back to find it. We see my take a look really fast me see. you're still it every two weeks on twice a month weekly.
3144.0,Patient,"yeah because they said once a month and i'm like that's coming I feel like that's too long. and we're twice, I know that."
252.0,Provider,Your compliance. You come to group every week.
3144.0,Patient,yeah okay.
252.0,Provider,I thought you did I know you did I know you do.
3144.0,Patient,"Well, so that's The thing is, like, I remember the last like. A lot like. what's her face Dr oglala capacitance she's like are you come to group every week and i'm like yeah Of course I do, or at least i've heard her asked people that all the time, like. Or maybe I think it was about Tina like does she come to group every week or you know is that a thing in the group, where you don't have to come to group every week or."
252.0,Provider,"If you want to extend your group out, the only thing that I see is I see what the one no show on the seventh with Sean. I don't see any other no show at all."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah, and for that one like I really hope it's like I do understand, but I bet I hope I don't get out of compliance for marriage counseling for. I mean, I could understand if I missed group or if I miss there because that's a self help thing, but my marriage like I feel like if I get out of compliance or get flagged or you know, whatever like I don't want our marriage counseling thing to get affected. You know."
252.0,Provider,affect your internal right.
3144.0,Patient,effect yeah yeah. yeah.
252.0,Provider,"we'll talk listen, is something that you talked to Carol Carol about and let her know that you can look through your chart that you have anytime that you weren't going to be here you do cancel and you had one no show, and it was a mistake period and she can override oh."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah I remember the last well, not the last time, well, I guess, the last time that happened where i'm like how am I out of compliance like i'm i've never missed a group. therapy or anything and if I. knew that I was going to miss it, I called and said I can't make it and reschedule, but I take this like really seriously, you know, and I felt like complete shit because at the time when I got the call or I got the text goes grocery shopping and i'm like how did I not know like. I don't know Sean said that they. There she told the care navigator to call me and asked me and make sure that was okay and. I mean I can't really confirm if they did call me but I don't I don't remember anybody calling me to change the date from the seventh I thought that maybe the person accidentally scheduled it on the Seventh, or whether it was with you, or with Sean but. yeah I was just. I was like how did I miss that that's my mind, like in another world I guess."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and talk to Sean about it too okay. Well um because far as i'm concerned you're never know miss, and if you can't make it or something comes up you let me know so you know you've always been complaining, in my eyes, no matter what."
3144.0,Patient,them even Sean she was like that is weird because usually check in so early in life. She thought it was weird you know. Faith to do so.
252.0,Provider,"yeah there was a reason. Something got misconstrued in the communication. Right so. Okay well have a great weekend and. Remember you've got some things to practice, you have some homework."
