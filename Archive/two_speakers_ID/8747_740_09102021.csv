740.0,Provider,sleepy. sleepy.
8747.0,Patient,"Well, I just had a nap. The pipes. The blood is flowing solely."
740.0,Provider,For a minute.
8747.0,Patient,yeah well yesterday I pretty much stayed up all night so.
740.0,Provider,What what had you stay up all night.
8747.0,Patient,"To be honest, I don't know. I just had, I just yeah I just had to energy, I guess."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8747.0,Patient,"And then the next day, my body was like you forgot to sleep."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. So. I know you've never met me formally I think the other individually, we have we wasn't able to meet So can I am. When I share I don't know how many therapists you have had before me."
8747.0,Patient,Just one amy really.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and what are some of the things I was working on."
8747.0,Patient,"We were. Mainly mainly just worked on like little. His little skills with. When it came to like interacting with family and stuff. Just because I had a lot of family, you know family problems going on home, so you knows a lot about how to. Basically, respond to a family with. behaviors that will diffuse any situation that you know they try to spark."
740.0,Provider,Okay they're going.
8747.0,Patient,"To be like a calendar. seems to have worked well, because I, you know i'm. starting to do better now, and you know. i've uh. i've placed more proper boundaries. You know what between me and. My living situation. Just staying away from sources could be unhealthy to my progress or just toxic and other ways. And then. that's pretty much. What our focus was on, and then I just told her like I you know i've plans to take the car and go to MED school. Okay, so. that's something that is a little bit on hold, right now, but once I have a place to kind of sit and. More permanently i'm going to focus on that, so I can take the exam. yeah so. pretty much it's just a lot of you know. Get out of your situation and move forward type thing."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8747.0,Patient,that's basically what we what we initiated.
740.0,Provider,"Okay yeah i'm. Looking at some of the notes. So then, attach you had an altercation with your brother and involve the police. yeah. See is there. Anything else on here but you're not. Okay well look i'll continue on that track thing I don't want to throw you off of that. So we'll continue to work on that in regards to communication. However, I want to look, I want to work on the opposite. because not only is communication wanting to be heard. or wanting people to hear you and to understand you but also communication. is being able to actively listen to what others are saying well. So we're gonna work on it. Being an active listener and and a lot of times they were sometimes we miss us because. You know the same way, we want to be heard and understood the person, on the other end of the argument, wants to be heard and understood it will. focus on light out. And so. let's let's look at that, so it says. Treating Melissa main as an active process being rather than a passage one, this means participating in conversation rather than acting as an audience. Accurate list miss show they are listening a parrot sharing and strive to understand the speaker so let me ask you this, what kind of listeners, do you think you are."
8747.0,Patient,"um. I mean what what types of listeners are there. We had. There are there are there, like actual types that were looking through our."
740.0,Provider,"Resistance, that is. A great place let's look at it. They do have types of listeners, however, I wanted, we have for the same way, you have like you have like a sort of communication passive communication and you have aggressive communication. So with listening, you have active listeners, you have passive listeners, and they you have non listeners and the you have. Like people who they like. It says like evaluative but that's more like people who evaluate everything that you say. Like they listen to be analytical they listen to kind of be pick what you're saying yeah. yeah so you have active listeners, you have passive listening and you have non listeners and then we're going to call them pickers."
8747.0,Patient,When.
740.0,Provider,"The last time, so what kind of listening to you think you are."
8747.0,Patient,"I would say, a mix of the first two."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, does this have accurate, I mean it makes of active and passive. Okay. Which one when."
8747.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm if we're if we're talking like me communicating with a person versus. You know me being in classes and lectures, you know because there's a lot of passive is a lot of passive listening that happens there."
740.0,Provider,"Okay well let's talk about what your family name is that's the biggest issue. Your interaction with your family so when you're talking to your family or you have a conversation with an individual and your family. What type of listening, do you exhibit, for example."
8747.0,Patient,An active listener.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. So this is basically to help sharpen those active listening skills right so it's a one way to show that you're listening. Putting away the distraction watching TV using your phone or doing other things, while listening fans the measures that the secret words are not important. Have you been guilty of a at all."
8747.0,Patient,No.
740.0,Provider,"Really, you a perfect with me Oh, I feel."
8747.0,Patient,"I mean like I. I don't feel like I go out of my way just to have big long meaningless conversations. i'm not that type of person. I actually have the type of person who grew up pretty pretty limiting and what I would say, because I just didn't feel a need to keep running my mouth regardless, it was."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, and let me go back to the other winning but we go. let's say on. My stay on. hey. All right, here we go. I will say on will fail your five being the communicators. I so there's. Three types of lists, I mean there's types of communicators passive aggressive and assertive right passes a communication. What do you know fast communication."
8747.0,Patient,I mean i'm reading it to.
740.0,Provider,Whatever you to ut.
8747.0,Patient,"Well, really it's be that i'm on the same page is. Passive communication."
740.0,Provider,"So for. Those that don't pass communication, the person prioritize the needs wants and feelings of others, even if their own expense of the person does not express their own needs, or does not stand up for them. This can lead to being taken advantage of even by well meaning people who are unaware of the passive communicators me and one. So someone who has some some some attributes or characteristics of a passive communicator is someone that is soft spoken in quiet. allows others to take advantage. Power tyler's needs of others. For our contact list down or away there's not expressed in one's own neither one and lack of confidence. Can you relate to that at all."
8747.0,Patient,"Or, I want to say, probably growing up in my household maybe a little bit."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8747.0,Patient,"Yes, of the past, more passive type communication."
740.0,Provider,"And so, how were you able to overcome it so from from childhood to adulthood how were you able to overcome being passive to. A to actually communicating."
8747.0,Patient,"log so was just exposure to the world, because a lot of it revolved around with around. Just family dynamics and the way the House was managed and. The role that you know, I was given as as the as the son over as the oldest son and and you know the roles of my parents. There, there was a certain dynamic grown up in the House and just You know, as I got exposed to the world more and more. Just all those all the all the things that. All the little things like cost of communication. characteristics to dissolve."
740.0,Provider,"well. Okay let's see about aggressive um let me see what is an aggressive plan Okay, let me try that, let me make it bigger So you can see, so other than revenue coming in again."
8747.0,Patient,that's. that's that's could be someone who's hostile. And just goes after his own needs.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
8747.0,Patient,"You know, or is every everything else, everyone else. Because he's putting all he's putting a lot of the energy into the. aggressive conveyance of whatever you know the person's communicating he's putting all the effort into the aggressive nature of it versus. Having an even distribution, you know of. of having having like a balance of like how how because I want to say assertive would come like well before aggressive. No, I would say, like passive would be at the bottom, and then you climb up out of that you can get too assertive and then, if you surpass that is you overshoot it. You can get into. aggressive communication and that's that's like taking assertive and injecting it with steroids and making it selfish basically. It was a way, not the way it looks to me kind of like a. Little. Each they each have their own place. And like a little pyramid."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely. makes sense to me alright so let's see. there's an aggressive communication and aggressive communicator so through aggressive communication, a person expresses that that only their own needs, wants and feelings matter. The other person is bullied and their needs are nor. easily frustrated some of the characters are easily frustrated speaks and allowed all the way on willing to compromise use of criticism, humiliation and domination frequently interested does not live in this space with the with us. Would you think."
8747.0,Patient,"I could, I could point out some people who are like that."
740.0,Provider,"In my family So how do you handle a breath of people aggressive aggressive aggressive communicator, how do you handle that."
8747.0,Patient,"i'm. Well, I mean we saw well I guess. I ended up just breaking away. From from that type of person I mean I. I easily will just turn my back to something that's unhealthy. To me and. When it's family it's a bit trickier. But then the process is a bit longer to turn your back, but. Seeing response you know to family. turn my back on on all the toxic. This the just the environment. Where a lot of there's a lot of things like disrespect a lot of criticism humiliation. going on. definitely no compromise on my family's on. Jesus, this is just like them. yeah but I mean I. it's it's really going to vary. On a specific you know based debate basis. it's going to vary on the specific situation."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. So. And a lot of time with family members, because of the fact that you didn't pick them. right with your friend, you can pick your frame. You don't think your family. As one of those things to like you know, like your stuff with them, if you will, I mean they might go nowhere. And so, is one of those things I guess in regards to. Knowing how to properly. Knowing how to properly respond to them, without taking your sense of peace. And so, when you mentioned turning your back, I guess, my question was a you mean meaning figuratively turning your back or literally turn a little bit."
8747.0,Patient,of both.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, with you okay explain a little a little more."
8747.0,Patient,I mean. let's. bless the environment.
740.0,Provider,"Do you feel do you communicate with them, or do you cut off all communication."
8747.0,Patient,With my dad's my dad's community.
740.0,Provider,"And with everybody you. Well, the last one. We have a part of communication so i'll start with your indication emphasizes the importance of both people's need. During a starter communication, a person stands up for their own needs, wants and feeling but also listen to respect the needs of others. assertive communication is defined by COMP is defined by confidence and a willingness to compromise so some components will not component, with some characteristics of an effective communicator is one there listen without interruption. One they clearly states me they want one that is willing to compromise, and one that stands up for own for their own right they speak in a confident tone. have proper body language, a monkey good good eye contact. So, can you relate to that."
8747.0,Patient,"Yes, I can relate to that."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, how have you become an effective. communicator."
8747.0,Patient,How have I become an effective communicator.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, and instead of communicating."
8747.0,Patient,"Well, because I I listen very closely to the other side of the argument. i'm the only one who tries to actually address everything keep everything structured. And not. You know not go off topic and and focus on the issue at hand and addressing that. I was only one of my family who did that."
740.0,Provider,"Alright, some examples. A friend Escobar you call. This will be a big inconvenience to you. So past give me a passive three to cadences um yeah I guess that's fine do you need me to fear the time, maybe. somebody's gonna borrow your call. And you a symbol for a barrier for the University of Tennessee. and aggressive say is no one, why would I let you borrow my car you crave it even a. And I started says, I need my I mean my car that day, but I had kind of dropped the ball. Which one did up."
8747.0,Patient,"Who has fun. But, but I would I mean."
740.0,Provider,"You muted yourself. I said it again, you said."
8747.0,Patient,You wouldn't be able to give it to my friend.
740.0,Provider,You say it one more time.
8747.0,Patient,If I needed my car that day I wouldn't be able to give it to my friend.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. Good deal. All right now let's do some practice your boss asks you to say like why everyone has Lee you're always the one who stays light and some nights you have playing, so what is a passive statement. To this scenario."
8747.0,Patient,"i'm. Okay, I guess."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. So Okay, I feel like. Okay what's. Okay. So what's an aggressive. They need to make. This scenario."
8747.0,Patient,you'd be like no screw you i'm busy. Boston block out.
740.0,Provider,And wasn't a third statement.
8747.0,Patient,"You know, you could know that that's where you would just be honest, you could I mean if if if you feel this way if you don't feel this way I wouldn't say it, but. You could say you know I. I would you know I would love to work a bit more make it extra cash, but I have plants tonight, so I can't, unfortunately."
740.0,Provider,Medical so that's all right. that's good next your partner left the myth in the kitchen and you to be the defendant what the password statement.
8747.0,Patient,um. You could so you would be talking to your partner in this. and I guess you would just be making comments about how you know there's that you know there's a there's a mess in the kitchen how the you know it needs to be cleaned up.
740.0,Provider,and
8747.0,Patient,"just seen my God, you know the kitchen is just so messy and it's bugging me and. I mean it's it's it's it's tricky because to. To like it's it's it's almost like you're getting into passive aggressive territory so you're going to run. You can kind of have a bits of the aggressive response. There it's just it's not you know it's not being said out right it's more like it becomes more of the the feeling that drives whatever you're saying. That sounds passive, but you know it's being driven out of your mouth due to some sense of instability or. It could be anxiety or worry about it, or just you being antsy about something that you want done that isn't done. But the aggressive side would just be. You you know calling your partner, a dirty. You know piece of something and telling them to get off their ass and clean the mess. Oh crap. You know, you could be like clean the mess, or else. Even even out of tiny threaten their."
740.0,Provider,yeah yeah okay so what's the.
8747.0,Patient,"assertive. You could just call your partner be like hey listen, you know there's. there's a mess there's a little mess in the kitchen I would clean that up you know i'll clean it up myself but i'm busy right, could you please you know take care of it for us."
740.0,Provider,"Perfect so with the passive when I was going to say you to the other mikey said that was the first response. Of course, that was more passive aggressive by most most of the time with passes is when they are passive person with basically yield their own desires for this or pass the person would say our they mess up the kitchen. I guess, I would go ahead and clean it up. And so, even though they know they're going to be there too busy to clean it up. yeah and which means that that means they're willing to put their deadlines and their obligations on the back burner, and just to be able to appeal or to rectify with somebody or something. So that was good all right let's keep going you're at a restaurant and the server brought you the wrong dish."
8747.0,Patient,"Passive you would just. I guess acceptor and decide to either. i'm. aggressive you start yelling at the waiter. um. And then assertive. You would say. You know, excuse me, you know I ordered. This dish you know not this dish. If you, you know could please exchange it for me. that's it yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Perfect last one, a friend showed up your House on invited. US usually you will be happy to let them in, but this time you'll be."
8747.0,Patient,Passive you guys just let them come in. Without even maybe without even. telling them that you're busy.
740.0,Provider,yeah.
8747.0,Patient,"You know just sure, and you know they come in. aggressive. You open the door and you're like what the hell, are you doing here, you know. i've. i've i've worked to do well, you say like i've shit to do blah blah blah blah. can't you know can't come in now. slam the door and him or her. assertive. You would you know you could be like. No hey you know, this is a nice surprise, but you know, unfortunately i'm busy right now, and I have to you know 10 tend to my tend to my errands. will hang out a different day."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm. Oh. wow like you got it. What do you think about that exercise.
8747.0,Patient,"That was kind of fun. yeah it just it just it brought in my head just a lot of. Little scenarios that. Maybe either you know either. A scenario I potentially could have experienced with a roommate you know in school or. You know I someone I saw you know. How they dealt with. You know the waiter or whoever after the restaurant. Especially, especially when things aren't going as quickly and as smoothly as you know, the people at the restaurant would like or the person at the restaurant would like. You actually then that's when that's when the. that's when things can you know turn sour when. when things are going, your way everyone's happy it doesn't matter. yeah you're not if you're a hothead inside what type of person, you are everyone's happy."
740.0,Provider,"yeah I agree, and so a lot of times so what's your medication, you have made, which are in the. park. Right, but you you, you have to live more so, communicating in in a in a effective way, because a lot of times. Even though you communicate. It doesn't matter, unless the person that's listening actually has the proper understanding. Which is sometimes people are not in a place to hear you. Which means that even though you communicate, sometimes it won't. produce a change if that if the person that you communicate to is not in a place to even listen to the understanding of the here. I think what you said in regards to, and I mean you say turning your back i'm going to say set a boundary. You know, because you have to do for your own mental health, especially if you know what you battle with and what actually heightens being body what actually and heightened you know i'm saying you're. The your mental health and so a lot of times, you have to pick those barriers in place so that you can be able to guard. You know i'm saying you're all meant to help them into and to keep you to keep you on being."
8747.0,Patient,"kind of like how there's you know US Customs for like incoming mail. You know from from overseas and whatnot like you have your own like mental little structure, you know in there, where you're you know checking all the things that are that are coming in and seeing you know what's okay what's not okay. yeah um you know, in order to in order to understand your own mental. State and mental health and and you know how to keep it running healthy because it's it can be technically considered you know, like a like a living thing that you're nurturing."
740.0,Provider,yeah every.
8747.0,Patient,"living thing, that is, you know being nurtured which is yourself."
740.0,Provider,"Let me ask you this, since you brought it up, how do you feel like you're nurturing yourself."
8747.0,Patient,"um. So I just heard, I just heard thunder and i'm hoping it's not raining yet. So I I say definitely definitely you know when you set boundaries. hmm um. it's when you set proper boundaries it's kind of like you have now created a border around your own continent. And it's it's a lot easier for you to just you know now that the boundaries are set for you to go in there without you know worrying about any anything trying to invade it and you can. With you know peace of mind and well being calm, because you know there's no nothing heightening you know outside sources. You can you can address everything very calmly. And it gives you it gives you a chance to kind of like how you know someone stuck in a confined blocks and they break out of it, they can breathe a lot better. yeah you know it's it's it's the same thing you know you're you're finally able to to let everything just breathe and. And it's it's it's like it's almost like your brain gets your your mental state gets to finally go into a slumber."
740.0,Provider,um.
8747.0,Patient,"You know where where it's like when you're not when you're not working on yourself, instead of it being in a state of anxiety or a heightened state due to whatever due to your environment your mental State actually gets to be in like these, like mini slumbers and. When that happens, like you notice you're not as tired. You know all the time you don't feel as strange. On the day to day basis and that's one once you start, I feel like once once that started happening once once I. I finally was able to breathe mentally I feel like that's when clarity, you know starts starts to come a bit, and you can you can really just you're like you're sitting there thinking oh my God like I have all this mental energy now that I can actually fuel into progression. You know, rather than running in circles around in place."
740.0,Provider,"great insight. For I think. You. has definitely prioritize you first. Which is, which is an amazing thing. And it's mostly now it's just keeping that same energy of practicing practicing it every day. Keeping it constant even in challenging times, even on the rough days, even on the bad days feel making sure that you keep on the forefront. You nurturing your mental health. by any means necessary because the way you are mentally will basically. Show and your daily living if you are healthy mentally than me Joe make healthy choices. That means you're living her life, that means you'll attract the people you know i'm saying, and so, but when you're not healthy mentally that means you will make a choice you will attract talk to people and your decision making will be unhealthy. Does that make sense, so I agree with you 100%."
8747.0,Patient,lot of sense.
740.0,Provider,"yeah and so, and a lot of times people don't understand how much their mental health impacts their life. And that's why a lot of times when people struggle mentally they trying to figure out alone, all my life about because your mind is off, with all due respect that's natural man, but i'm just saying."
8747.0,Patient,"holiday, no, no yeah hundred percent."
740.0,Provider,"yeah, and so it just a lot of times. We do have to take a step back and like you say except those batteries and various I think it's amazing so so he'd appreciate you so much for meeting me today and. Thank you so much for this session and I look forward to meeting you are not meeting you I look forward to our next session. is very, very."
8747.0,Patient,you're very pleasant.
740.0,Provider,You appreciate it is there anything in particular that you would like to work on for the next session.
8747.0,Patient,"um. You know. Not not the one thing that stuck out to me is the whole. Being constant you know, like getting getting to that getting to that point and then being constant where regardless of. The outside environment and what's coming out you that you know that constant can stays constant how. To pierce through anything you know, without without changing. Okay kind of like a like a like an equation law. that's that's the equation it doesn't change regardless what changes are the things around. The equation is constant."
740.0,Provider,Now.
8747.0,Patient,"that's definitely because I mean it's one thing it's one thing to you know achieve something or get somewhere, but it's another thing to keep it, you know, to keep it steady there, I think, I think. You know that's that's the thing I don't want to underestimate manana feel like Oh, you know i'm i'm invincible i'm. I have it's constant you know I don't want to just say that, and then one day, you know some really intense situation happens where depends on and. Then shattered in seconds."
740.0,Provider,You know yeah yeah yeah absolutely I agree so okay we'll keep working on that did. You have anything else for me.
8747.0,Patient,No that's good.
740.0,Provider,"Well, I appreciate you again so much for meeting with me today, and you have a fantastic weekend and i'll See you in group."
8747.0,Patient,"Yes, i'll see you."
