10253.0,Patient,"The loop is I am right now figuring out a new plan i'm off the steroids, right now, so i'm not doing real well because. That stops Sunday, which is the first time in a really long time without them so it's worse, I guess. i'm noticing more like. You know inflammations the big."
323.0,Provider,"thing yeah and, of course, the big risk factor."
10253.0,Patient,"And so now getting up in the mornings is. parts that were not inflamed before it's not painful some days are for last week was a little bit painful I was all really irritable the weekend. But that was a lot of mentally not having the steroids, and that that takes care of my pain and my stomach's to ruined, for I. And, but that I think that was more mental I think when I get in playing I get tenses and attention causes to pay and I don't think it's."
323.0,Provider,"More than that, but just."
10253.0,Patient,"So it feels like somebody put sponges in between all my joints when I get up at my knees feel like they're this big they don't look back. But I can feel it and, like the last couple of days i'm just not getting things done so i'm irritated. Because I like to get up on my daughter gets up in the morning, she gets done, and today I got up when she got up but I didn't get done till Stephen start doing anything to a quarter to 12. It just sets me off, we just got back from her concert a little bit ago I just i'm just irritated because I have so many things I want to do and i'm becoming less and less able i've got to adjust myself and I don't want to do that. Do it and i'm irritated by it, because my mind like."
323.0,Provider,Is the ability to go yeah.
10253.0,Patient,"I can't do it anymore The good thing was mentally um well it's going to go back down the rabbit hole I guess that's why i'm upset about the steroids, is that, last week I finally got to a good place. With a cognition at the. yeah i'm assuming right after usually says i'm right when I assume, because you know lupus attacks different organs."
323.0,Provider,"Right, so the inflammation."
10253.0,Patient,"In the body, but it depends what it's attacking and for me it's usually kidneys liver by heavy music does pretty much a pattern."

You know and. for whatever reason it's not going in remission and it."
323.0,Provider,Is the Cleveland clinic I mean it just.
10253.0,Patient,"It can't we're missing something. yeah and last week we thought we found it because my daughter, said to me, I told you how this we caught the mold issue in this right. So my daughter's. she's the reasoning in the House that I tell her I don't always notice things if you notice that you tell me."
323.0,Provider,"So, like."
10253.0,Patient,"Like temperatures she tells me when I make it to call things like that, like so you know because I am I become aware that that I, so I know that i'm too hot that it's be Do you know what I mean. yeah and so she said, you know i've been meaning to say she's I think that air conditioner smells again it's been smelling for a little bit and. Just memory shit i've got to start getting a system and maybe you can help me with because I think it would help my mental health thought and i'm not organized enough for my daughter's got add to his I have my biggest frustration and my biggest. Mental triggers is everything's everywhere. And applause you know I think pretty much now it's been four months i'm pretty sure was now, which makes all the add where's we tried my the medicine doesn't work anymore there's no point, even going down the stimulant road."

10253.0,Patient,"At this point. What I need you to because I do this I can't get it. back to the add without when you get lower estrogen somehow that makes explained it to me, whatever but anyways so I bleached it again and I was hoping that I would have the same result I had last time. And it didn't happen, so I i'm looking i'm trying to figure out what i'm doing is the doctor feels like i'm doing something."
323.0,Provider,And i'm thinking God.
10253.0,Patient,"I mean up until May I was drinking I have celiac disease which triggers all of this, I was drinking beer. And rename probably um well, maybe not every day, but I mean the fact is, I at least had three beers most days and probably some more than that, plus shots all of that stuff was bad."
323.0,Provider,It was none of.
10253.0,Patient,"That i'm not ever being careful sometimes I eat stuff with with it, that you know that triggers it, but like. 5% better, as far as what."

10253.0,Patient,"Worse, and I don't understand. Do you know what I mean, I guess, I expected. That that should have changed that that's what they have. Right right, you know what I mean and their body is doing different i'm like i'm telling you what i'm doing like and we've cut stuff because of the memory problem we've caught where i've been doing things I shouldn't have been doing, like. Like somehow or other my brain forgot to pretzels I don't understand it sounds so stupid telling you this i'm sitting there bottle these pretzels bottle these crackers I know better."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
10253.0,Patient,"I remember, thinking it out and thinking that that no they're gone. it's gone."

323.0,Provider,"Right, there are other ways that you can."
10253.0,Patient,"make a difference, yes, yes, yes and and I. i'm going to put together friend of mines, working with me, I told you to do some of those trainings and I feel like for right now, because I don't know where this is going to go that I don't want to commit I don't want to do supervision."

10253.0,Patient,let's go back.
323.0,Provider,Because.
10253.0,Patient,"that's not what I want for our profession, you know what I mean I don't want to put mess out there, but at least what the webinars i'm gonna have a professional if I know them, you know you're gonna tell me what i'm seeing it, and then there it once i've got it right, then it's right."
323.0,Provider,You know. But.
10253.0,Patient,"You know I just i'm frustrated like I like writing that I finally have the time right now. I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't read this book that i've been supposed to review for five months and I got this much, and I forgot already what all that is so it's just it's frustrating i'm. Like I forgot this point, I forgot you last week that two weeks ago and i'm sitting there and I, and I set the alarms in my Google thing but somehow I don't understand technology, because I went to technology now to be me."
323.0,Provider,know.
10253.0,Patient,"And I still don't have it set up right because it does it remind me day, the only reason I remembered. Is that I was talking to my daughter about something and I talked to Dr Tuesday and remembered I had to get her Thursday because I skipped her to. And then I was like wait, I said every other Wednesday and only because I remembered when they set it up, that it was every other Wednesday and I went wait it's 930 it's got to be 930 I hope it's 930 and I had to go sort through emails because. If I know I put it in my calendar, because the other one was there was out of the same email I don't know what I did some I screwed it up, but I remembered and I still had to remind myself at 830. Because I forgot again and after a while and then Wednesday 830 and then set myself a reminder to go off to go don't forget because I walked her I forgot her the last hour before the appointment, I remember that morning, you know it's frustrating."
323.0,Provider,But what do your days look like.
10253.0,Patient,"Now my days now my days are pretty much I get up in the morning, I get stuff done I started going back to i'm only seeing about eight patients, a month that's it. And all minor stuff I talked to the patients that have been waiting for me it just said, like look just I can't."
323.0,Provider,"I feel, because."
10253.0,Patient,"Like they would waiting and I was like I just I can't I will take you right, no, no, I can't and my ethics or everything."

10253.0,Patient,"So I i'm not taking any mental health, right now, and I am trying to I went back to doing what I used to be good at, when I was in college, which was like. five separate auctions or buy things wholesale retail selling. Well, I got back to do with that. it's not fulfilling and I noticed that i'm getting frazzled with it because it's clutter for and clutters triggering for me that's childhood shit."
323.0,Provider,and
10253.0,Patient,I stopped doing it and I forgot why I stopped doing it until yesterday when I got frustrated when because my living was all perfect and now it's all clutter.

I literally get up in the morning and even though I don't need to I run all day in the House, mostly I try not to leave today was exhausting to go to the concert I just overwhelming to be out but I. I realized I just keep running all day like I can't sit like we finally got a big TV which you'll be proud of me I can't wait to give."
323.0,Provider,"You, the TV over there yeah yeah."
10253.0,Patient,"we're trying to tell you the story I got it for free, because it broke on somebody and they put it up and I thought and the guy said it's the motherboards 100 and some dollars, and that was worth it for that TV. Right and I looked on YouTube and I stuck the damn thing in the oven for 15 minutes and it works it restarted it it's a problem with all the LG TVs. I got I got another I pick up tomorrow and i'm going to give it works and i'm solid but yeah so I got a TV. Great yeah 15 work I smell a little bit, but it works, but I I i'm just. doing what can be done in two hours but it takes me all day running the."
323.0,Provider,"circle, but."
10253.0,Patient,"It keeps me like I don't stop until it's time to lay down and then i'll turn the TV on I maybe get five minutes of it i've watched the show yet, because I. I don't I just I think i'm avoiding things I don't want to sit still you know you already made me cry so I haven't what I said simple. You know and. I just I sit matt a lot mad at all chit just dump stuff that doesn't even have anything to do with me, I noticed i'm like my brain gives a level 10 response, nobody gets it I keep it here. it's stupid."
323.0,Provider,it's i'm just frustrated.
10253.0,Patient,"i'm frustrated I I went bought all kind of self help medical medicine herbs and everything else, and just."
323.0,Provider,it's almost like there's a level of desperation and trying to find something that will be healing.
10253.0,Patient,"Yes, because this was at you know what it is all my eggs in one basket. And I like that basket. And even if I had money, I like I love that."
323.0,Provider,um.
10253.0,Patient,"You know I went I bought books, because I thought it was thinking about you last week and I I was bidding on these auctions and like I you know I i'm i'm an anxious person So when I do buy things. If we leave it like lots of other people would buy at a higher level, and still make a lot of money i'm always afraid, so I go if it's not super low I don't buy. These books, they had these books. and They were the little house or not, but also the bright Nancy."
323.0,Provider,Nancy drew books mm hmm yep.
10253.0,Patient,"So Nancy drew and little house on the prairie and the hardy boys That was my escape when I was a kid. I read the same eight books for probably 10 years old. And, and because I had so much anxiety as a kid I remember, he was shit too, but it was just go into fantasy land. Right. To where I go to sleep at night, if I didn't have the book just start the story."
323.0,Provider,Yes.
10253.0,Patient,"Right, did you know what i'm gonna buy these and i'm cheap. And, and your birthday, they didn't they didn't have listed his first editions I knew they were, but they did not even worth all that much not unconditionally where I spent $17 for five bucks that's a lot i'm not paying 110 cents for a book. But I said a buying it because I wanted on my shelf, for it to be to remind me that, like things have gotten me through."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10253.0,Patient,"I mean so because i'd lost those books couple decades ago. Well then, I got him in the House and i'm allergic to mold and. which makes all this crap worse. I know it because I get watery, and all this stuff right, so we ended up helping up you know I did I gotta figure out a way to save one of them, so that I can. get it on the shelf."
323.0,Provider,yeah so.
10253.0,Patient,"You know what a man. yeah but then like even saying that it's just being in competition like not just like I told you, I couldn't figure out what was going on but see, just as I said that to you, I know what keeps triggering this out just as soon as I said that i'm digging, and all this old shit with mold."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10253.0,Patient,"Which is probably why all this is happening, it didn't even just this is how it is normally I would have known that. Right, I did that. I know right and I just talked to you about that mold and now just saying it now, it just dawned on me when I."
323.0,Provider,could tell me. How it occurred to me yeah.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm tired of those two week delay right frustrate you know what I mean it's um. it's it's it's frustrating for my daughter, have to be the adult on something's luckily I know the memories and parents and we don't fight about it. Right, but she tells me she's a good kid she's an honest kid so I know what she tells me, you told me this."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
10253.0,Patient,But it's also anxiety for her.
323.0,Provider,Because her and scary.
10253.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm supposed to be the one you can count on. An adult sometimes you know and that's frustrating."
323.0,Provider,You know.
10253.0,Patient,it's just. I don't know I guess it's just been a mess like.
323.0,Provider,it's been.
10253.0,Patient,"Changing year a lot of friends had to go lead House you know, like getting sick and finding out that I never needed anybody, and so, when you need somebody and you've always been there for them, and you never needed them you never."
323.0,Provider,got there.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so i'm over that greet part of it i'm still resentful which I don't like being resentful, but I am, but I just changed the number of conversations, but I guess now i'm just."
323.0,Provider,"Also, stimulates a lot of loneliness even if. You understand what it is."
10253.0,Patient,"You know it's crazy that's that's the part I don't that's the problem I have is that i'm not, but I should be I should be, and I was just telling my daughter I gotta start finding a way to do stuff social I don't want to. Because I think that's what i'm supposed to do and i'm afraid someday I wish I had but I don't miss. I don't know I think it's safe, because I think, because having to trust people causes anxiety."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10253.0,Patient,"Having nobody isn't absence so avoidance maybe. But. I don't receive it, but I have been trying to engage like I do have some friends that i've had for a long time that that you know their lives have been we don't see each other life because their lives are busy. Running calling them one by one third game already helped me do some of this stuff sort through some of the stuff. And I just like he's a wonderful person and that person has been my friend, a long time, and I was just like I just feel like I can't stand looking stupid in front of people, so I couldn't wait for him to leave. Because it's one thing for my daughter to see all these slip ups, you know what I mean it's it's another."
323.0,Provider,So what is the shame and embarrassment.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah. um yeah you know what I mean absolutely like and it's, not that I think it even more judgmental. I don't I don't think most people are gone out of my way it's just been this other than my my best friend Jeff jeff's a police officer other the. jack all of the rest of my friends i've the brains for them. Do you know what I mean i'm i'm the one they call, but it needs to be figured out and I like that. I don't want it all I like i've always liked doing that you know just. hey, let me tell you do this call this system do this."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
10253.0,Patient,i'm that girl and that's been my useful yes and not using me it just has been and i'm like. You know shit.
323.0,Provider,And so. What is it.
10253.0,Patient,about now.
323.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah.
10253.0,Patient,"I catch them not I catch them. editing themselves. Like my one friend he's having some financial trouble and because I always do the case manager part with my clients, I always know all the resources."
323.0,Provider,Right and.
10253.0,Patient,"You know he's disabled but he's always you know, had a little job but it's sisters now yeah she's bedridden and so now he had to give up the job to take care of her. he's back he's on a fixed income because utilities got all behind and I had somebody had told me that I just didn't want to bring it up till he dead. Right I caught him start to say it, and then didn't I wouldn't have normally you would he's never ashamed, he told me and what's going on help me. And I just went you don't think i'm competent enough to help you know hurts it's not a disease me and he's trying to be kind but it's it's it's it's like when I had cancer I got I didn't want my friends to know. right when they found out because they active. Right can't stand to be treated like i'm week. You know and."
323.0,Provider,"It almost, though, is standing I can't stand that. it's it. It sounds as though you're struggling as if it's a deficit."
10253.0,Patient,"I feel like it is. And maybe that's just a little my snobbery that that that I, that it was the one thing that was. My strength and what I was younger I was arrogant about it, and maybe that made me feel important to be the one that could figure it out, because I. Could I could always see the gaps in systems and go just do this do this and here's the legal way to do it, but it's right on the line. But here's how you get this help and here's this person like you when they told you know what here's what i'm saying isn't. That stuff you know what I mean and i'm always really good at that and really helpful I helped myself when I was younger when I needed those systems, you know and and that's my little anti social to the systems to make."
323.0,Provider,"Sure, I."
10253.0,Patient,get what you don't want to help them with but but yeah I don't trust people enough to get to a point where I have to be the one asking them.
323.0,Provider,Right right.
10253.0,Patient,Why they didn't know.
323.0,Provider,And you enough like bad advice take yeah and.
10253.0,Patient,"And I should not know me anxiety that's the only reason. I do like my patients, and I do like to help people but do please and I learned all of those things, and the details of every system and what the rules. Are not coming from the staff of the rules is because, when I needed it I don't trust anybody so by the time I would call and ask for help, like when I was young, there was a. thing that they had a one time thing when you're getting off of welfare my son was little, and you know, so the day counts certain amount of your income, but then you have this thing, where you could get a one time, help to keep you working like with those car needed fixed or."
323.0,Provider,Something yeah so.
10253.0,Patient,"They would never tell anybody about that I when I bought the manual for job and family services and running and seeing what things that were. available to help me not need a system instead of what you wanted to do because you're just going to do the minimum of your job. And i've never liked that, and so I do those things, because it makes me feel secure you know I looked it up. What happens when I don't have the cognition too, because most people don't waste that much time looking shit up like I do. I know it's not that i'm smarter it's that i'm i'm ridiculous and details. And is it healthy that it probably waste a lot of time. I could have done without all that extra digging but the anxiety relief for the anxiety was worth."
323.0,Provider,"The ability to help others, which is what drives you yeah."
10253.0,Patient,"What do you do now like I can't do it with this, I don't have any fixed."
323.0,Provider,"Right, no."
10253.0,Patient,"that's going to shit like you know it's just. it's it's it's frustrating it's so frustrating, and I just. The last two years it's just the wrong time to happen, I think it's just what happened, four years ago, I could have gotten around it a bit this last few years have lit a fire in my bad about our profession, and I mean and. There are things that needs to change in our field and i'm I don't want to leave our field until I have at least. attempted with others to to speak on that to make that change, I already bought the domain started the website I can't get my brain together to get it together."
323.0,Provider,I.
10253.0,Patient,"Just can't I even got other people on it, because I said I don't want it to be a me thing. Right whatever and and it's just like it's frustrating to see the problem. And no I can't even pull it together to get it."
323.0,Provider,"But do you go from beginning to end, or can you do the little steps along the way in terms of setting the goals to get it done."
10253.0,Patient,"You know what I that's something I have to learn and that's what I was telling you, I have always been like a typical add person who just does it all."
323.0,Provider,And right right.
10253.0,Patient,"And so what's making this worse is that i'm not a consistent, step by step person had I had those types of skills, like most people do I think I could just I don't know that this deficit is is big."
323.0,Provider,I think you would have been. managed differently.
10253.0,Patient,"Right, you see what I mean. yeah it's the combination of this plus not having those executives kills. Right right, I have zero."
323.0,Provider,"I, but you could train yourself with them, you have the knowledge, you have enough of awareness again."
10253.0,Patient,"Honestly i'm an idiot on add stuff I don't know where to begin, I really don't I don't."
323.0,Provider,"Suppose What if we use the domain. web pages part of the example, so you bought the domain you're in development with a web page what's The next piece that needs to happen."
10253.0,Patient,"Next, would be. Once it's together like I reached out to other therapists across the lake that are we're kind of speaking on that to say like I want this to not be like I want it to be a site that isn't my site."
323.0,Provider,Like it's just.
10253.0,Patient,"a bunch of dip so that it's like a collective group instead of one individual. And that wants to gather is getting it out, the problem is the opportunities to get it out been coming at me I got got scheduled to do two podcasts. One and Two I don't have anything together, I can't go hey and then it's not there to see what I mean like it's just it's not even that hard to put together that's so stupid this isn't hard to put together the sheets already written I just can't get it together. Keep starting all over again, how do you do this I keep forgetting how to put it together the software does this shit I literally don't have that much i'm done I just cannot put it together for the life of me."
323.0,Provider,Could you engage someone else to do their part.
10253.0,Patient,To trust somebody that's.
323.0,Provider,I know I don't.
10253.0,Patient,"See that's where that arrogance comes in, about."
323.0,Provider,That it doesn't have to be you right. yeah right.
10253.0,Patient,"And I have to learn how to, I guess, I have to decide that the cause is bigger than my stupid ego. mm hmm and then I can't be all that much better than other people oh I. Do you know what I mean I bring things all those thousand checks makes me not better but but they don't miss something a little blow apart. That that's not that they're not good enough it's because there's some of them that are so much smarter than me on this subject. But i'm afraid they will double check things that have it together, I guess, I always prepare for attack from the other side. that's what I do when I put an argument together, I already before I ever even say anything so save me and you're going to do i'm coming to you and saying you did. X y&z wrong, this is what you're doing wrong i'm already before I even say to you phyllis you're doing something wrong. i'm going to set for our and have the conversation back and forth with you in my head and everything that you would bring up I already have the answer. And that's when I start by the time I start it's already over and that's stupid, but any other way, I feel so vulnerable i've never done it any other way. yeah I don't ever I don't ever say disagree with something unless I already said they'll say this that i've got this, then this, then this I don't ever do the process hmm Do you know what I mean nobody ever knows I don't do the process like Jones. Right i'm quick witted but i'm not i'm not smart about quick minute half of its that I just sit up for days and days and think well, then I would think this if I were them, I think this is."
323.0,Provider,All played out in your head.
10253.0,Patient,Nobody ever friggin brings up. Right right yeah and that's why don't get shipped on it.
323.0,Provider,Well yeah because during your head versus taking action yeah.
10253.0,Patient,I don't like I just don't know hold on I gotta get this year everything in can you say something so I can see if it's clicked.
323.0,Provider,yeah i'm still here oh shoot.
10253.0,Patient,"I got off the airplane thing hold on. Wait, let me just turn this down at when it went off the air, but we just turn the volume down. One sorry. There we go. yeah so it's just sitting with it. I just I have to figure a way to deal with the anxiety of just."
323.0,Provider,Is there someone in your networking circle a colleague that you could. Some of those over to partner with.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah I do that, like here's the thing I think my conversations I always mean for that to happen, even this I noticed, like the people i've been talking to. A lot of me like the most of them are way more significant than me in this field and I liked what they said, like hey I don't want to steal your idea, do you want to come on board and you say that you know what a man. And I believe that people have to have for what they do and and I just also think it's better if it's a lot of people and i'm also counting on me not being competent at some point, so this needs to be not me. A major thing in this and and I don't know how to ask that late because I thought okay it's a tea, but then somehow my words, and I know it's my words because it's been a problem always some of my words make people say that i'll just call you when it's time. hmm and I know it has to be me, because this has been consistent, because these aren't lazy people they're not."
323.0,Provider,So it's almost like there's a disconnect in terms of what the next steps are.
10253.0,Patient,"Being down or something I don't know. Like I guess I don't know how to stay let's collaborate like how to. I don't know what i'm implying, but I think what i'm implying before, is that all that i'm going to put other than you just show up I think that's what i'm replying I don't."
323.0,Provider,work at first you're just picking their brain and then. Like what. When it's time for the next steps it's somehow their misunderstanding that you'll just be in touch with something.
10253.0,Patient,"Like what will happen is like actually two of them came off a Ted talk one is Dr Barry and she was talking about something. And I went oh my gosh and it was just it was something she had written on, and I went oh i'm sorry just kind of made a comment hey Would you mind inbox me because I if you don't want anything to do with to give me permission to put a link to your."
323.0,Provider,This been on.
10253.0,Patient,"People can kind of come because that's what she talks about all the time. And they know what people to learn the resources of all these people. Right and so anyways being forgotten this long conversation and started talking and I guess what I was trying to convey was. Oh, my gosh you think the same as you have a lot more knowledge in this area there's no point in be sucking your knowledge and then putting it in my words and doing this. Right already the expert in that part."
323.0,Provider,Right and and.
10253.0,Patient,"Would you mind and I don't think she was like oh my God yeah I think it's great to have a bunch of people pulled together and and to just be like this is the position of of this this group of individuals, this is what we're seeing across all states, you know what I mean."
323.0,Provider,"yeah, but I think."
10253.0,Patient,"I don't like I don't think I conveyed it right because she's just like okay well, let me know you know, like when you're when you're ready, you only want this, and if we want to schedule podcast and I think we skipped."
323.0,Provider,you're ready.
10253.0,Patient,"don't know what happened it happened with a bunch of people, so I know it's me I know it is like these people have been on this, these people have been advocating for this loudly."
323.0,Provider,Waiting for me.
10253.0,Patient,"huh Do you know what and I told him about the domain, which was a few idle because I was so afraid you know you get that because one is bias and psychiatry know you ever forget about that domain. And so we're just having them all there that it all goes to this and bias free mental health our domain so i'm going to go there, because the point is whether it's race, whether it's able ISM whether it's neuro divergent it's not about race, this is about, we all have biases. Right well been trained to learn about cultures, instead of checking our own biases and barely trained, all of us, barely trained to check in and when it has it has never been as deep as I think we're all learning, now that our biases are mine yours it doesn't matter. And so what I the goal was to expand this, especially in psychiatry I hate to pick on what especially there, and that includes about low income. Because I have to be. Right yeah and you know when someone was I was going to write on as well, now the second one he just he just got arrested because you know I told him I don't know why you hire me when I go chill. If you're going to do kind of shit, especially in my presence i'm telling. You about why did you think I wasn't going to see it. Like I don't like iron man Joel Joel dip if you still. don't do that to lie Jesus i've been weeks and i'm out of bed she's got your two weeks ago, and what are you doing you're hurting people. you're hurting people and luckily I told you, before I was worried, the vendor going to do, like they did last time I was so happy, they did it. The girl is called me and one of the psychologist who runs a CIO what's going on, she called me the feds came in, they give. Patients to left the medication there they didn't do last time, the three patients died because they close the doors right then diplomatic detox too bad. They did their family and they are assistant and making sure they get and medicaid waving prostate line stuff so they're doing the right things, these people get this this great evangelist you know, whatever, but the point is. All of these. have to do this it's irritating me not to do this, but it's irritating me that I that have it all together in my brain and then, when I go to do it the pieces disappear does that make sense."
323.0,Provider,"yeah but I hear frustration with yourself, for not following through, but I also hear frustration that you can't partner with some folks that you've identified is wanting to partner with I don't."
10253.0,Patient,"I don't get it here's the thing I don't think I have this field goals, this is a I was the one who started this I don't think I have like outside of a clinical team like i've led clinical teams with like psychologist and all that stuff."
323.0,Provider,Right.
10253.0,Patient,"Patient thing and then that's so easy because everybody knows the roles you're not really organized and shit everybody knows the roles. Right, you know what I mean I don't think I what I need, I think, as an organizer I don't think I should be the one putting it together. Like I know the pieces that need to be there, but the putting it together thing I don't think what's happening skillfully."
323.0,Provider,"Well, what if what if you partnered with like a student who has to work on a project, and this becomes the project."
10253.0,Patient,You know what that's a really good idea that Chair of the counseling department as a friend of mine.
323.0,Provider,"And the student would learn a ton in doing that. Right, yes, you know and you'd get the project done."
10253.0,Patient,"yeah cuz that's what i'm running into it's the hard works done it's I can't I can only follow one lane and it's and then, when i'm down one lane I don't see the other five. can't pull out and see all six lanes."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10253.0,Patient,"I don't think i've ever been able to do that, even it's worse now because I used to be able to write and find a way to put it together."
323.0,Provider,Right.
10253.0,Patient,"I can't do that anymore it's not their gender, any man it's that my mom used to say that one track mind. And, and I know i've got the right pieces I just but that's a really good idea. I guess, I just have to watch how much I talked to them because i'm embarrassed like Dr."
323.0,Provider,"Well, that is part of it, which is like you still have to get. And you'd still have to get organized about here's some of the material here's what I want you to do, and some of its going to be having to let go and let them try to get it together."
10253.0,Patient,"I think I could do that because, then I would see as it puts it, because then I would see it as kind of how a patient like I never have problems letting a patient do their own stuff."
323.0,Provider,Okay right the student has to learn right.
10253.0,Patient,"Right, so it just reframes what it is. you're good."
323.0,Provider,just listening to you just working with you.
10253.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,"And that's exactly right, I, like the analogy of it would be like working with a client that you know needs to grow through their own experience as what a student."
10253.0,Patient,"And I think honestly when it comes to organization end of it, I know i'm weak there I that's The one thing I usually. As long as and generally agrees with the pieces that need to get there, I generally know and most anybody, but me is going to do a better job at putting it together in a piece, you know what I mean like I just am not. I just don't have it. frustrating now when i'm older, because I think it's more embarrassing to be the add more embarrassed that part is more embarrassing you get older. It just is you know when a man."
323.0,Provider,"Well, and you've got so many other. Factors happening at one time."
10253.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah that's true. damn menopause everything else, she says."
323.0,Provider,yeah. On top of all the other health conditions. stuff that you've got going on.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm glad it just said that mold thing you know what I mean is that, just like I. I knew it had to be something because it's just worse and that makes sense because there's a lot like you can see my eyes a little messy now there's their stuff I buy in and like me modes blocks my sense of smell."
323.0,Provider,Like within.
10253.0,Patient,"A around it, so the only way I know is that my nose will hurt and my idol ej and then I you know it's mold but I can't smell I don't know really how do not smell that just it's that quick that it blocks the smell that I don't smell it so there's probably. I just bought a bunch of shit and i'm sure um but yeah I just I want to work on. Getting organized. learning to do things, step by step in life. Having a routine i'm getting frustrated with missing appointments so frustrating I can't tell you how many appointments and things I set and Miss all the time now."
323.0,Provider,"And you carry what, at least, like a. pocket a routine. yeah do you carry a pocket calendar room."
10253.0,Patient,"Well, I."
323.0,Provider,You know I mean like an old fashioned pen and paper.
10253.0,Patient,Maybe I need a physical one.
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10253.0,Patient,But I can I can get one. Maybe.
323.0,Provider,Like when we used to yeah like when we used to put client appointments in one of those good old.
10253.0,Patient,"calendars yeah yeah you know, maybe i'll just get one for the wall, because I do have like the little real quick ones, but i'm all for them, so it doesn't matter wall, but if I were the coffee is."
323.0,Provider,uh huh.
10253.0,Patient,"That, I know I mean, then, I know i'll see it because that's what I said i'm getting the routers are getting up at about the same time, what. About about the same time, but the days aren't messy. And then I just forget everything and then it frustrates me and makes me angry at myself, you know what I mean i'm almost 52 years, all this is ridiculous, you know and i'm sitting there on your therapist friggin Monica by. purpose like ridiculous. And you're right, I think I just did I switched I bought this whole software things which zoho which is like all the mail the calendar was supposed to solve everything and."
323.0,Provider,Sometimes it just confuses it more.
10253.0,Patient,"And I think I added too much in and just made it worse right, I think, if I get a simple wall calendar i'm going to order, one on Amazon tonight and then i'll just add the first thing I do every morning is get coffee, so I just started their mother."
323.0,Provider,yeah you look at it every day.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah and then that will let me know, and I can, especially put the important stuff and then maybe a reminder to hey go look at your calendar on your phone. Right, you know and amy and for the ones that aren't there, but if I can just make that a routine. I don't think I would be floating around his last every day."
323.0,Provider,Right.
10253.0,Patient,"You know I mean it's just aimless like I literally the end of the day when I write down what I got done i'm embarrassed it's retarded but I didn't sit on my ass around in circles, you know."
323.0,Provider,What I also think.
10253.0,Patient,i'm still hydrated I keep forgetting to get back caught up like literally.
323.0,Provider,Well that's not good and that doesn't help your brain function dehydration either so then sleep eating. thinking.
10253.0,Patient,"The chaos has to go i've got to get this routine and and I think that will help a lot, because my meds even even my months from Dr so. I just realized right, as I was coming to log in with you that I didn't take it at all last night or today. I wonder why I was feeling i'm stay and i'm like Oh, and then I look here and i'm like oh yeah that's why because they were supposed to be do yesterday, and I still have four left. wondering why the pharmacy I seen that they were calling because they're probably wondering why didn't pick my mentor."
323.0,Provider,Right.
10253.0,Patient,"And then, if I looked through I actually have them print something out last month, for me, because I wanted to see how bad I was doing it. Every seven days that every night because I don't go to one that's just my role. Right, you know, so I don't know till them out, and then I I didn't realize that I was messing up that much."
323.0,Provider,"Right, you are forgetting to take them. And that's not gonna help you feel better because that's not going to miss those."
10253.0,Patient,"yeah no it's not and you know, the thing is, I guess that for me that. She had to explain to me because I was like well I don't really feel like. On wealth i'm not having them and she's like, but you are because the scattered this gets worse."
323.0,Provider,Right.
10253.0,Patient,"And then she was like I thought it would like I would sit that she's like, no, no, no, no it's more chaotic it's worth out of this so that's also what's messing up your stuff is that."
323.0,Provider,Right at least.
10253.0,Patient,"It from what I looked at from him, I think one week I took my medicine every day I picked it up the morning of the eighth day there was somewhere like 11 days later. I did like I said I go you I won't go so like usually it will end at night, sometimes i'll end up in the morning will be the last one, but I don't go till there's no."
323.0,Provider,"yeah but even the joint pain in the lethargy and things like that. could be missing the medications. Using Oh yes, because the withdrawal from that is going to hit right away. And it is not pleasant."
10253.0,Patient,"that's what it is, and I didn't know that."
323.0,Provider,"it's not a pleasant feeling at all, and it will hit, like you, Miss one dosage and you'll start to feel it."
10253.0,Patient,"Well then, that's probably what i'm feeling. i'm just gonna Gemini order that calendar, I have that that."
323.0,Provider,And the medicine might need to go near the coffee machine.
10253.0,Patient,yeah. I just put it there.
323.0,Provider,i'm going to coffee as part of the daily routine than the medicines got to be near the daily routine. yeah. I would suggest trying to let's work towards a week of consistent medication and see how you feel.
10253.0,Patient,"Okay, you think maybe that's causing it."
323.0,Provider,I think that some of it. Missing dosages yeah.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah cuz it's a lot, like this one, was filled. You know I know I told her yes today, it was gonna do today, so it was like oh yeah so."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
10253.0,Patient,i'm way off.
323.0,Provider,yeah left 11 days.
10253.0,Patient,"Sometimes I asked her I said, can I take she said, as long as you take what I tell you to take for the day. She means you want to take it like half and half and half and half long as you said, I need you to the total amount has to be what I tell you."
323.0,Provider,During that day.
10253.0,Patient,"And I think that's where I started screwing up because, if I look I think there's that yeah there's half in here now. Is that I started, because I was wasn't working real great. And and but now it probably is this too, and she said well i'll take it, and so I was taking halves and I think honestly, maybe I just didn't do that because I think that's where i've also got confused because my brains still saying, well, I took it twice."
323.0,Provider,Right.
10253.0,Patient,"You know what I mean right, I know the morning i'm terrible at getting in the morning at night, I think. I probably missed one night a week I think most of the missus are happening in the morning, I really do I think most of the time in the morning. Look at something about navels because it's like right here i'm usually have the time sleeping in the Chair. But you know what I that's what i'm gonna make my goal i'm gonna get a calendar so look at the calendar in the morning, so that I can get rid of some of chaos in my life and the first chaos will be is just."
323.0,Provider,"and try see how you feel after a week of consistent medication, it may take away a lot of bills aches and pains and some in the brain scan or."
10253.0,Patient,"52 and look at me. yeah yeah i'm going to do that because I would be nice if that would fix it, you know, and I don't think my doctor my lupus doctor never really asked about this, they. I mean, she knows i'm on the medication, obviously, but she never really asked yesterday wasn't helping with the pain and I said no. You know it doesn't help with the pain, but. The pains in formation pay. yeah with a hopeful that ibuprofen or steroids. But you know what yeah that's what i'm gonna do i'm just gonna. Maybe that'll make it out of the calendar just feeling like i'm not."
323.0,Provider,Right yeah well in your body chemistry is getting messed up because some days you're taking it some days you're not and it doesn't know what to do.
10253.0,Patient,"yeah and I think one day what day was it, I want to say was this weekend, I know, there was a point by white holy crap because I did start really feeling too well, then I noticed it. And went wait a Min account pills, and I look back and i'm like oh my God it's been to friggin. day like and and you know what I mean I was like how did I missed you friggin day."
323.0,Provider,"And no nausea. or anything like that, with it."
10253.0,Patient,"You know the kind of guy that's what i'm saying what I would expect happening is not what happens, and I think that's why don't connect that."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10253.0,Patient,I don't get well you know what though maybe actually.
323.0,Provider,yeah now that I say.
10253.0,Patient,That wait a minute I did have some some serious balance.
323.0,Provider,"Yes, it could be really."
10253.0,Patient,constipated my back was.
323.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
10253.0,Patient,"I did I just didn't connect it because it doesn't feel the same as the other, so I didn't connect it's the same sickness."
323.0,Provider,Can that could definitely be part of the withdrawal.
10253.0,Patient,yeah. yeah so that's that's what I do i'll get the calendar and then I make sure my medicine every morning every night.
323.0,Provider,Do you have another appointment with Dr cell scheduled.
10253.0,Patient,Tomorrow 145.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, so I tell her we spoke tonight that were wondering about some of this for some miss dosages and what the plan is yeah okay yeah."
10253.0,Patient,"yeah because I want to get that I just didn't even think about that it probably is because, if I think about once I went on the medicine and I told her I. said everything I work medicine, but see I haven't been taking my medicine right well so everything got worse because I was taking my medicine well. To be honest, medicine, I think it's making things worse, but it's probably."
323.0,Provider,"Consistency yeah yeah definitely. it's just we're just sorting through things so yeah. we'll get there we'll get there, you can do."
10253.0,Patient,One my brain. I feel a little hope i'm really hoping that the problem.
323.0,Provider,Is this pain is different.
10253.0,Patient,"And that makes sense, the pain is different it's not anything I told my doctor feels different it's really stiff and like it's different right."
323.0,Provider,yeah yeah I think if you before you even like. Let Dr sell know what we've discovered just tell her what your symptoms are. And I think. she'll get it right away that that's the Miss dosages are really sending your body into a tailspin.
10253.0,Patient,which they just had a patch patch or something you can take that just doesn't it's no.
323.0,Provider,"No there's no pants there was an injection at some point. i'm um I don't know if that's still around, but you could definitely explore. That with Dr sell other options."
10253.0,Patient,I mean i'm willing to put the effort into to me.
323.0,Provider,yeah but i'm just saying.
10253.0,Patient,"Like I also know that add issue i'm definitely gonna. Go better but i'm still like i've historically always had. The only medication that I always took consistently was steroids and ibuprofen because they gave me instant relief, so it reminded me to take it."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
10253.0,Patient,And the people's was terrible so it's but but but yeah i'm dead i'm dead mean i'm going to get I think that calendar having that right there I think when digital outside it was a bad idea for somebody like me.
323.0,Provider,yeah.
10253.0,Patient,And I can.
323.0,Provider,"Even in your phone right, you have to you have to go into the phone to look for it. yeah, and that is one step more than what you have to do if you just stare at the calendar yeah."
10253.0,Patient,"And then just getting that right, and then i'm going to tell her tomorrow it's fun i'll talk to her about that and then also just see if there's an option for something that just is like longer lasting less."
323.0,Provider,"Yes, yes."
10253.0,Patient,"You know what I mean. yeah I know I heard about something, but I also imagine that it's probably just out of my pay range probably usually, when that, because this is. Very affordable."
323.0,Provider,And I think.
10253.0,Patient,"I want to say, I actually had a patient say something about that, but it was somebody with a lot of money, and I want to say they had something that was like once a month, they got it they had to go all the way to Philadelphia to get some it was a shot or something like that. But I want to say it was a crazy amount of money, and so you know, but it but i'll just get there with this, I don't hope."
323.0,Provider,yeah I know.
10253.0,Patient,"That it's helpful would probably wouldn't be that hard to stick to it, just like this area."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, and I know the injection is a once a month thing I don't know in terms of costs so in in where insurances are in terms of covering that or not. But certainly something to talk about with her."
10253.0,Patient,"yeah just to see, because I know, sometimes pharmacy the pharmacy. drug companies have programs to."
323.0,Provider,"Yes, absolutely where they'll. sponsor and support."
10253.0,Patient,Definitely qualify.
323.0,Provider,Right so.
10253.0,Patient,"Right yeah I just I just something, but you know what now that you say that I just i'm thinking wait a minute, how did that's what I mean a year ago my brain i'm a clinician I know my brain want to put that together, I. I sit there and I tell it to you, and it didn't absorb into meet, are you fed it back."
323.0,Provider,"it's, just like the most is the books and the mole though it just it's not connecting and that's I mean that's okay it's not a deficit, even though it feels like it is it's just something you have to adapt to differently."
10253.0,Patient,yeah. You have to adapt.
323.0,Provider,"Yes, yes. which you have mastered throughout your life so you can do this one too."
10253.0,Patient,yeah I just.
323.0,Provider,"wanted, but I will, I know it's just in your tired."
10253.0,Patient,"And I am I think today it just got me so bad because I finally realized if I don't change things i'm going down the rabbit hole. Two days right body said i'm done like I got up this morning, my daughter got up she wakes me up and the last last week a couple of days, she always tell a week, make sure i'm up before you leave. Because otherwise i'll sleep a day away and I went up and I want to get things done and, and so I texted her like 11 don't why don't you wake me up she's like I did. And she thought it. It was tapping out well then, this morning I kept struggling with coffee trying to get going, this morning couldn't get going. Finally, lay down back down to sleep for a little bit and like I said it was quarter to 12 and it still was just a little larger Day and it just. frustrates me because I know for me once that exhaustion comes in, I am I have been fighting since May to not go back to the girl who lays all day but. haven't laid in bed since May. or may have spent weeks laying in bed OK now."
323.0,Provider,go back to that right.
10253.0,Patient,You know I mean i'm so afraid I don't need to be super functioning i'm not trying to be super strong girl taken on the world but I don't want to go back to that it was terrible her was to me.
323.0,Provider,Right it's just terrible.
10253.0,Patient,"sleeping forgetting i'd sleep for 48 hours like i'm free from that I want to go back there and i'm afraid. i'm afraid my body's gonna tap out on me, you know."
323.0,Provider,"Well, your body will tap out. Sooner if you keep it on the roller coaster of the medication, then, if you can consistently start to take. The medication."
10253.0,Patient,"And i'm going to do that, as a matter of fact i'm gonna. Forget. That we already have it in because I don't do a certain time, like, I was always doing soon as I get up I go to bed, but I think I don't I don't know why just."
323.0,Provider,Forgetting.
10253.0,Patient,"I think, because i've got time these things to it so there's aren't there's a. And now that you're saying this, these are symptoms that i'm withdrawn from my medication just the same as it is, when I don't have the steroids like I know when. um I know when when the. When I stopped eating the program I knew what that was like because I could, and I knew what I need to take it anymore, because it will ruin my right to do it. Right anymore um, but that was a pain I just think about it, that was because that we missed two days and what's so bad I don't my daughter scared of going back to where I was in May, because that paint it not been that bad since May, but it was this."
