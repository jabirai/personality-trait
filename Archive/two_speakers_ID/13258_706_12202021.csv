Even though I was told I was told that's fine no big deal because I can't on ahead of time, I still joined on the Wednesday, because I wouldn't back to sell know that I wasn't playing games with no big no no it's not like that just was not able to make it but hey here I am you know."
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah.

I have asked several times to send me a cup and normally and I keep being told ones being sent to me verified my address yada. yada yada but I don't get I don't get the email or wherever this tells me the tracking number, so I don't know if I got one coming or not, I know I haven't told her to do it, which is fine. What was Christmas narrating coming on, I just want to get the cup now so."
706.0,Provider,"And when we're done here go back to the virtual clinic and ask them when it shipped out and they'll be able to tell you, and they probably have a tracking number two."
13258.0,Patient,So that's the thing I always get tracking them the last few times i've gotten the tracking number. More prepared long you know I got some again. that's beside the point Christmas narrative I. don't want to be late that's my point I don't want to be late.
706.0,Provider,"No, I appreciate that I like that you like to be in compliance, it makes our jobs easier. But yeah no, I would just go when we're done here go back to the virtual clinic and tell them and just be like hey I requested a cup I don't see that I didn't get a tracking number for it, can you tell me if it's on its way and they'll be able to tell you."
13258.0,Patient,"All right, very good. Other than that, I don't know really know what else to say today."
706.0,Provider,Okay well. Tell me when i'm going on.
13258.0,Patient,"I am aggravated about a couple things but. Okay there's nothing I can do about it well, first of all. My dad my brother handles my dad's finances. And last year and the year before he gave me $200 $100 for camden $100 for Huxley. kids well that's what we're shooting for this year to which i'm going to get but, since my daughter. This work is kind of weird. My ex wife adopted this girl actually she adopted two of them they're sisters."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13258.0,Patient,"There was some abuse going on, and so my daughter adopted the other one girl, so now it's my daughter's daughter."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13258.0,Patient,"So I guess that would make her granddaughter me, I mean I don't know it's my daughter's adopted sister. So I told Cory i'm like well i'm like you know, can I leave I her name is I on I don't I still can't figure out how to spell it. Amos I on, and I said, you know, can I can we wait a couple months on that she's like you can't do that dad you know we have three kids now you have to understand you have three grandchildren now not to. mm hmm so just this morning, my got notification i'm not getting $300. Even though my dad's tennis okay it's his money. But my brother will not give it, so I just said how about split the difference, make a 250 he won't even I don't think he's feeling good at four he told me now. So I told my dad I said you had to talk to Joe and see what you can do I said because that's not right, you know what the hell, am I gonna buy a 12 year old little girl and a six year old boy and a two year old what the hell, am I going by for 200 bucks you know. When you get up the store and you see the prices man tender outrageous."
706.0,Provider,Oh absolutely.
13258.0,Patient,"Like what the hell, am I going to do here that's why but. Mostly that's got me a little bugged and then my sister that lives here with us. i'm going shopping on Thursday. And she just will not stay here to sit with that for a couple hours, just like this morning I got an earful and it's just like Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba I gotta work and Baba Baba i'm like forget it forget it. I mean it's an absolute nightmare, and I even told her I said amy I don't ask you for much I said I ain't seen my kids and my grandkids number two months, and all the ass for you to do is sit with dad a couple hours flying Christmas shopping. I gotta work and i'm not too tired BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA and i'm like fucking fine forget it just forget it. I just think that's wrong, and I think this girl is not wanting to do this anymore."
706.0,Provider,Is she i'm living she so she lives there does she pay any rent or expenses or.
13258.0,Patient,Anything nope see her rent is helping me.
706.0,Provider,"Well that's what I was gonna say so, if she's not paying anything to stay there, then you would think that she would be you know bending over backwards to help because she's saving a ton of money."
13258.0,Patient,"off, I told that this morning I said she's ruining it she's blowing it because i'm the only one, keeping her here dad could care less. This one out now i'm going to keep them data fe my brother he's the one who got really into this, he could care less if dad says shootout he'll make sure she's out. But where else he could care less. But, so my bottom line is i'm doing is keeping her here."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13258.0,Patient,"I keep telling it's like I told that it's funny I said she's blowing it she lives here for free she works literally five minutes away. minutes away at a nursing home she's making over $16 an hour. He works five minutes away from where she lives for free she's got a boyfriend that lives trying to cross the way here to lane, not a road it's a lame they live right across the way. it's like are you kidding me you can't give me two lousy friggin hour to go Christmas shopping my grandkids. No, she will not nope. nope nope. Well, I. was like wow."
706.0,Provider,"I mean to have a conversation. I think you need to have a conversation um you know what I would suggest is having that conversation of hey. I feel like i've been patient. You know dad is to the point where he doesn't want you to hear anymore, because you're being difficult. i'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt i'm trying to work with you. But you're never free. You have no expenses like we've you know you're not paying anything All I ask is for a little bit of help and you're not willing to do that, so if you're not willing to do that, then maybe it's time that you find other arrangements."
13258.0,Patient,"Well, you know what the problem I have with that. Then I don't know why. I pretty much become attached. Another words I. feel good when she's here. You have a code i'm not. i'm not i'm not alone with dad."
706.0,Provider,And then.
13258.0,Patient,"Right and when a couple of times, she left here all angry and everything about I literally teared up, and I even told dad I said why am I feeling like this. he's like can you become dependent on her and why I don't know I said I don't know either. Because it's not a sick thing i'm it ain't like that kind of crap i'm just saying that I just enjoy her being here. And just knowing she said, but she doesn't help me hardly at all my brother rich says, you know Jeff what does she help you five minutes at night or less than five minutes in the morning. i'll give you example this morning. I heard her come home from work at 530 in the morning, she won't even do q&a enough work till seven so she got up early apparently but I heard her come in. At 730 I got up got me a quick shower and Aaron got dressed. And then I woke up I said you wanted to get up he's like yeah now it's gone eight o'clock so i'm not gonna I heard her in a room on the telephone she was on her cell phone. I knocked on doors hey you ready to get helped me with dad yeah give me a minute, you know long it took her nearly 40 minutes. And what she did was she sat in there for over 15 minutes, then when she came out she went to the toilet and sat there such a puppy but Saturday, and it took a total the whole thing took a total of 45 minutes."
706.0,Provider,up your me.
13258.0,Patient,You still there.
706.0,Provider,yep i'm here.
13258.0,Patient,"i'm sorry I was my older brother called me I just I as a brother i'm on my counseling I gotta go can't talk later. But anyways long as you can hear me but anyway. I just told my dad I said you just you can't talk to her, you are there in a flat out and drag out argument. And hollering, and all this and i've told her I said amy people who live in glass I said you don't throw stones at glass houses, when you live in one year. Those I could blow the world up on her right now i'm choosing not to because I don't want that I want her to stay here with me and helped me with them. But you know just like when I asked her about that watching dead for a couple hours, I told her I said I don't ask you for much. I saying see my grandkids never two months, and I have not asked you, and I said you can't sit the tetris for two hours Why go get my grandkids a couple Christmas presents, are you serious. And know bye bye bye gotta work Baba Baba Baba bag you don't understand me she just goes to frick off. yeah no i'm trying to figure out how to handle it because."
706.0,Provider,You have to be interact. And you have to set boundaries.
13258.0,Patient,"Well, just like I told Dan I said she is like this close to blowing she's going to blow it, because when her aggravation gets above her helping me. i'm done. i'm done she's got to go."
706.0,Provider,"What do you. What do you think about sitting down with her instead of approaching it in the way of hey you're not helping if you can't help you need to leave, what about approaching it in a way. That gives her more power so saying hey can you sit down, so we can talk really fast and you guys sit down and i'm just really like you know what's your schedule like during the week you know, like. And then just asked her so like Maybe she works. You know, nine to five or whatever, and then. During an outside in time where she's not working, and just be like you know, once a week, can you just you know hang out with dad for just a couple of hours because I really got I need to have that couple of hours to myself to run errands to do things, but you know you can pick. You can pick you know the day in the time but can you just give me a couple hours a week."
13258.0,Patient,"Well, see that's what bothers me the most is that I never I don't ask her for Nelson. comes in those as she pleases. She doesn't make any more meals used to make dead breakfast every morning she hasn't done that in months."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13258.0,Patient,"Well, all she did a few just new house cleaning whatsoever, and you know i'm out here running bear in a run at hand and foot getting dead cigarettes can dance coffee getting dead more cigarettes. he's alive, he dropped a cigarette give me some coffee give me some. Give me some chocolate now give me another cigarette I just dropped my cigarette. i'm being that's how i'm running around. And she just. She sees children do. Can. I get I got therapist i'll be right back. Here, and my dad San Francisco me i'll be right back question okay all right, thank you. equals a. rock. Okay."
706.0,Provider,i'm sorry I.
13258.0,Patient,"apologize about that that was my dad's therapist last one to go out and say hi and. That was all that as to that, but you know, yes I have thought about doing that trying to set her down, but the problem with amy is for some reason she just wants to explode. Okay, can I told dad, as I said, you cannot have a conversation because, like this morning, when she came and helped me with that, even though it took her like 4045 minutes come in, when she finally came mass in the morning, you know she's like I don't feel good. i'm like Okay, whatever or dad had an accident during the night, you know what I mean I pooping out. And she's like Oh, he went to the bathroom how could you know, no, no, you didn't smell it. into bombing just went off on me i'm like me I didn't smell it I didn't know dad didn't tell me he just you know for number one she's making him feel like crap because he did that, and then to she's blaming me because I didn't have mall clean go and i'm like I didn't know I mean really. What we're gonna do about Thursday she like i'm not. gonna work BA BA BA BA BA boom I said amy I don't ask you for much you tell me you can't sit with that for district cup no I gotta work BA BA BA Bam Bam Bam Bam and find phuket forget it just forget. Well, you don't understand you don't understand i'm like amy fucking forget it. You know I over $30,000 in child support on kids I can't even see how you feel that and then my bank shipping out of 4000 I said amy that's got nothing to do with me just forget it forget it no you don't understand you understand Baba Baba I mean that's what I went through this morning. And that's why it's kind of hard to sit down with her and try to have a conversation, in my opinion, I don't think she wants to do this anymore, I think she wants to live. here for free go to work and come and go, as she pleases, but as far as taking her dad I don't think she wants to do anymore, I think she's done and if that's the case she's gonna have to go because. that's just burning my but too much I don't appreciate her being here and not helping with."
706.0,Provider,dad.
13258.0,Patient,"You know that's just ridiculous yet, and you know."
706.0,Provider,"Is what did I agree, and I think that conversation needs to be had what are you doing for you, I know, last time we talked about self care what are you doing for self care time."
13258.0,Patient,"Or, I mean self care as far as what."
706.0,Provider,"Self care, taking care of yourself decompressing de stressing."
13258.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I talked the data all the time and because that's all for my recovery, obviously. and leave me and my brother rich who lives in Florida, I talked to him every day, and he continues to tell me how proud, he is of me and stuff. So that's pretty much what I do, I mean I just stay I stay away from issues. Okay i'll give you example real quick I shouldn't really say this one one to my half sister smokes marijuana well. The few times I went out in the garage he was getting ready to smoke i'm like whoa wait, am I gonna get out of here, I said, you know I got drug screens. And I can have a son and I get away. But so but no i'm not wanting to meetings or anything cuz I don't feel that I need them at this point. have my dad to talk to. You I have my daughter to talk to they're always there when I need them, and I have you. yeah absolutely. i'm not having any cravings or anything it's just I just have to ration."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. let's say you have a stressful day like you did today when your sister was just being difficult to cope with that, what do you do."
13258.0,Patient,"Well, once we got that up she went to bed I I didn't go off on dad but i'm like can you black did you see when I did you hear what i'm talking about now do you understand, and you get that. that's what I do and I got off my chest I tell him I said i'm not yelling at you pop you know that i'm not yelling at him just telling you he's like why can't you just tell her to go. I said well. I said when she helps me here, and she aggravates me here when the aggravation gets above the help she will have to go, and right now she's pushing it I said this is absolute shame. Because her, and I could be so good for one another on working with dead. So you know I, I understand, she works third ship I get it that she's tired a lot I work third shift, so I do understand that, but her and I working together, we would be such a great team. For dad you know I can get him up she makes breakfast I mean whatever she wants to go see your son up, and you know where she her sons and a. And boys home up there and North I don't exactly know what county or whatever on up his cheerleader or Cleveland but its way up North in Ohio. She wants to go see her boy like she's done three or four times already, since I came back from seeing my daughter go I got dad. But then when you come back and you have another couple of days available i'm going to my daughter's but no it never works out it never works how she never tells me until I asked her. So it's a problem. it's a problem that's definitely a problem."
706.0,Provider,"Well, I want you to make sure that you are doing self care, so I want you to make sure that you're like taking walks relaxing decompressing you know, taking a long shower whatever it may be that you can do for yourself to make you feel. Better and also make sure that you're getting good sleep hygiene, so that you're able to fall asleep stay asleep you're having good sleep and then good diet it's important that you eat healthy, so that you can maintain a healthy body. So you don't."
13258.0,Patient,"Well, I try to eat good my own fault is i've gotten into the habit of just not eating all day and we go to bed, I take my medicine and then I eat, then I go to bed. And then everybody tells me I that's wrong I shouldn't eat like that, but that's What I want, I mean yeah cuz I know like right when we get off the phone right. Now, or when we get off the phone by eat i'm like i'm exhausted i'm tired i'm like. it's like breakfast the same thing breakfast is the same way, they say breakfast and most important part of meal well, maybe it is, but not for me because of my mouth I don't want I don't want to. do nothing, so I just find it more comfortable to me and I do eat good I don't really overeat but i'm keeping my weight of 180 hundred 85."
706.0,Provider,pounds so you're maintaining.
13258.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm maintaining and. I don't you know I mean yeah I mean, I guess, I wish I could get better physical condition mm hmm right now on this one and."
706.0,Provider,yeah I get it.
13258.0,Patient,All that bad you know.
706.0,Provider,So you're still so you're still working on that goal of self care and that's fine because it.
13258.0,Patient,"Just just like. Just like my surveys, I take every Monday again Monday and always calling you because you know when i'm done with the survey it doesn't say said. Or it doesn't it doesn't give me an option on the site they always call one of the surveys, it says, you know what is your goal that you want to keep going and whatever, and I say stay clean. Put that write down every single one I say stay clean stay clean stay clean."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
13258.0,Patient,"that's my biggest goal, I mean i've got other goals. Staying clean most big one."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so your major goal is that you want to stay clean and that's to get there are going to be, you know. Self care, making sure you do self care, making sure you use appropriate coping skills, make sure you're eating right make sure you're getting enough sleep Those are some main things that are going to help you maintain your recovery."
13258.0,Patient,"And that's what we want, I mean cuz I don't want to screw. You know, statistics say i'm going to but you know what."
706.0,Provider,"yeah there's a little skewed but I mean there's absolutely always a chance of relapse I mean recovery is full of paths to relapse but. The thing with relapse when you're in recovery and you might slip up, but then you get right back on that road to recovery. run as slip up as a reminder of what you don't want so um so yeah you know just make sure self care time coping skills sleeping eating make sure those things are good go to you know going to therapy going to group all those things are going to help you to maintain your place in recovery. So, and I think you're doing."
13258.0,Patient,On to another reason why I joined in the Wednesday meeting with Dr sell you know because I didn't have my meeting that we just thought yeah i'm wanting to join in and they'll give me more health and mental sure Dr sell that hey i'm not just blowing smoke here.
