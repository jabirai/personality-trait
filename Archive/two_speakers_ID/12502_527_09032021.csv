If it's you know, looking at transferring to. A you know, one of the therapist myself or someone else that. You know works with eating disorders. As you know, because we also know that with eating disorders it's there's usually underlying issues you know the complicated as well, so you know there's there's usually. You know, mental health or substance abuse issues that kind of go hand in hand, so we We understand that both of those sometimes get addressed at the same time. And in kind of complicate things they're kind of intertwined with each other, so I know you're kind of has a 10 on on addressing the food stuff and the eating issues.
