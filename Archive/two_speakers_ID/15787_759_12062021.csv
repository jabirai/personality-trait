You know just get rid of all the stresses in your life, you know get rid of everything, and that was like the worst decision like you know, probably that time period, so it kind of. threw me off a little bit."
759.0,Provider,"me off the bed okay listen standard ball yeah but sometimes you know people mean well, but at the same time to kind of like Okay, you know the hard particle is that for me to just get rid of it, everyone."

759.0,Provider,"Probably mm. hmm okay so just some passive si in the back and back of. Your head sorry yeah yeah Okay, you know, and the best way to deal with, that is to talk about it, you know, like i'm going to be acting in future sessions to how you feeling, you know, in terms of aside. You know thoughts, you know you know, maybe both right now It just seems like passes passes, and you know not really having any plans, but you do have a history of it so just making sure that you do well in are okay with how you're feeling.

15787.0,Patient,i'm probably about two months ago I should say.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, is it cutting. Cutting okay. Okay we'll talk about some coping skills in regards to that. Sometimes it's easier, just to see the pain on the outside, are to feel pain, instead of emotional pain internally, so I totally get that you know yeah. and current medications do, but did dominic put you on."
15787.0,Patient,"So that was kind of a thing is she I wasn't sure if I was going to pick up my prescription or like I haven't picked up my subscription yeah I didn't really figure out like what she gonna keep my dosage because. Originally, my psychiatrist from my. Previous doctorate from last year of 2020 gave me 20 milligrams but she put me on TV 10 milligrams because I restarted but then it kind of threw me off, because I felt like I was already on 20 milligrams and then the 10 milligrams just wasn't it's never really. It I don't know I have always had a problem with the 10 milligrams. And I told my previous doctor that and he always got me on the. 20 milligrams and then it was just I felt like the 10 milligrams is working, but then it wasn't that same time because it was a lower dosage than what my body was acquainted to."
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15787.0,Patient,"And I don't know I just I took it and then it happens it thing, and it was just like as big I don't know what she wanted to do with my medication, or like. What she was she wanted to push me on ssri but I told her I don't want to go and so sorry it's like that's like not what I you know initially wanted was like. or any mood stabilizer anything, because I feel like he made me feel like I don't have a conscience, and I feel very emotionless and not myself right I just didn't That was the best thing for me."
759.0,Provider,yeah So what are you on.
15787.0,Patient,I haven't she put me on 10 milligrams of the adderall.
759.0,Provider,And oh. Okay.
15787.0,Patient,bye.
759.0,Provider,"and have a filter prescription, yet you were previously taking 20 milligrams. Yes, and now with the 10 milligrams is you're just recently started eating again what's like the reasons why she want you to start you off. yeah yeah grams, and you are, you are you a little bit hesitant with doing that."
15787.0,Patient,"i'm not that i'm hesitant, it was like the 10 milligrams i'm not at all like it's not that like it's just. I felt like it was working the beginning, then it wasn't you know I mean like it was OK, and then it was just like not working at all after a ticket for a week and I was like Okay, well, I felt like I should have felt some I should have felt a little different after maybe. Taking for about a week or two. And I didn't. So I just really and then this whole thing happened, so I just stopped taking it because it wasn't helping it was."
759.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so you like to go back to 20 milligrams."
15787.0,Patient,"or any other maybe. different branches of something else, maybe that. Maybe a different combination of something that. That isn't. You know any mean."
759.0,Provider,"want something to discuss with dominic. yeah for sure. Well, when your next appointment is with her."
15787.0,Patient,"She set it up where I have to make my own appointment, I think, because she probably wants to see me kind of take initiative and. mm hmm do that but i'm kind of lost because emails and emails and emails email, you know so i'm kind of like trying to figure out like who zoom calls meetings do I meet or who and that's why it kind of was like a runaround horseshoe kind of thing, where I. was just like okay connect to one room and then figure out. yeah so I just."
759.0,Provider,What I can do is how the virtual clinic reach out to you to schedule your next appointment with Dominique this.
15787.0,Patient,"year and I told her that it will the phone calls are best because a lot of times when I get emails I tend to avoid them or all like beat briefly look over there, and like Okay, since I didn't know this, I don't have to reply right away, and then i'll forget about. A week. And i'm terrible at that, and I feel so bad because, like he will like you know me from right heart and like I like."
759.0,Provider,"make sense i'll tell them to make sure they do a phone call to reach out to you just get referred dominic okay yeah yes please okay. sounds good all right we're gonna dive into family history any you mentioned before, would like for you to state it for your record any psychiatric or medical issues with your parents."
15787.0,Patient,"My dad got 50 and 50 for a few times Throughout his life I don't know how many he tried suicide side TIM safely, he was on and off of alcohol and miscellaneous drugs. in and out throughout my childhood. You kind of just came gotten when he wanted to really um. mom never really drinks never really smokes doesn't do anything just works as a nurse. Okay, so nine to five."
759.0,Provider,"All right, and how's your relationship with your parents these days."
15787.0,Patient,"could be yeah well I better. My dad is just very needy. Even person. And my mom's add. My therapist talked my mom few times and mention how he thinks she might be like narcissists are have something wrong with her, because the way she acted in certain positions and. he's never really reached out to get medical help or anything like that she never really agree wanted to agree to that or never really sat down for therapy and stuff like she really believe in that so um. You know our relationship isn't that great I would say that our relationship is a lot better than even my father's right now. mm hmm um it's very tiring like being around her, though, because I feel like talking to a wall. You know you're like talking to them they're just like Oh, but then my friend was like Oh, on Saturday and you're like okay cool. And my dad's got in some ways, so it's not. it's like not functional."
759.0,Provider,"uh huh. yeah so it's kind of hard with the relationship between you and your parents and it's a lot of like an you know being said, are not being said on and you're not feeling totally comfortable."
15787.0,Patient,was like they don't listen like if they don't want to hear it.
759.0,Provider,"I was about to say like you know, like. It seems like you're unheard."
15787.0,Patient,yeah just kind of you know yelling and shouting but like it's just.
759.0,Provider,Not it's going on deaf ears.
15787.0,Patient,"And the thing is like I used to have tantrums when I was a child, because they didn't listen and then they get 5150 and then it would turn into self harm if nobody was paying attention."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm. So that's the history of that yeah. So you grew up with both of them in the household sounds like.
15787.0,Patient,"yeah it was very on and off throughout my whole childhood, for they split up when I was like six 810 12 then they finally split split when I was like about 15 my mom kicked me out sent me and my dad. was my dad since that's really yeah."

15787.0,Patient,"yeah I like it, too, because I think a lot of the cultural, the cultural background I have in my area it's very hard to find like an English speaking like little therapist and a lot of the Vietnamese and stuff background, people are. yeah I when I was looking for a psychiatrist and looking for other because it's very hard to find like you know English speaking. Where does my my my guy no I can't understand you know, half the time so it's kind of hard when you can't convert like you know correctly with someone that you're trying to get help from.
