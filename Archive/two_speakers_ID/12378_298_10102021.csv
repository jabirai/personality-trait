Because you know my anxiety isn't like it's not I get triggered by social situations, I can my anxiety is constant and it's pushes me and pushes me and pushes me. And until it gets so bad that I I can't do anything and the anxiety and the add kind of collide or my add gets so bad that I can't function, you know it. And yes, i'm just constantly trying to manage myself, so that I can continue to function. At the level or the way I, I want to and I get really frustrated when I hit a roadblock and so then i'm changing everything up, so I can get back to function and I delegate compulsively. got a great network that I build and manage people."
298.0,Provider,And it's wonderful. it's wonderful.
12378.0,Patient,it's exhausting.

298.0,Provider,"So why are you on refresh my memory, but why are you on only 75 milligrams of them faxing."
12378.0,Patient,"Well, I wouldn't I I wanted to get add meds and I got really frustrated it took me a year and that's actually how I ended up in this bright heart health system. Is my insurance company could not find me a doctor and I live in Tacoma Washington they couldn't find me a doctor anywhere in the state virtually or not, that would see me for diagnosis for add."
298.0,Provider,Without I didn't.
12378.0,Patient,know it was.
298.0,Provider,"I didn't I had no idea was that that access to care, so thank you for telling me that go on."
12378.0,Patient,"So with yeah within my network and they wanted me to every place now wants you to will only see you for this, if you are with them for primary care, everyone has gone into a base system where to get behavioral health, you have to be in our primary care system as well. And I didn't want to drop my primary care because I have a lot of. Medical issues that they've been working with me on so anyway, and they didn't feel comfortable doing diagnostics with this so. It was a mess so after 10 months I finally contacted the Department of office of insurance, Commissioner and ended up. This was a solution is for me to go to bright heart health, but in the meantime, my I was like I can't keep not treating my add I don't want to go back on all these meds you guys always put me on depression meds and that's frustrating so i'm not depressed. I know it goes together a lot but i'm sorry i'm not depressed so stop miss miss medicating me um and so, in the meantime, because I wasn't sleeping. I was getting the part where I was really on functional is having daily panic attacks and not able to sleep they put me on Villa fact seen my primary care. While I was trying to get too bright heart to them will eventually get to pray hard to get the actual diagnosis that still not showing up in my chart."
298.0,Provider,Let me.
12378.0,Patient,Her primary care.
298.0,Provider,Okay well it's showing up in my my end.
12378.0,Patient,"yeah I need to hopefully get it back to my primary care providers, so I I can, if I ever anything ever happens as part of my."
298.0,Provider,"Medical right, so you could order it and you could like order. I don't know what they call it. They have a name for it, but basically it's a document of your diagnosis is and their meds you're on and it sent to your primary care, so there is something out there, its continuity of care or something like that. it's called a Colm. And we could possibly get that sent over you just need to request it."
12378.0,Patient,"Okay, I think I probably had the paper, and then I I didn't finish the process, I think I started it so."
298.0,Provider,"it's a little different yes, you need to do that one paper that's a release of information. But then, you also need to request that the document be sent to. it's a two step process. So that would help. So at 10 milligrams twice a day is that taking down your anxiety is it working on your depression."
12378.0,Patient,I have 75 milligrams once a day or even the vaccine.
298.0,Provider,Of Ritalin I.
12378.0,Patient,"i'm. I have it, I take it once a day I didn't realize, I was supposed to be taking it twice a day."
298.0,Provider,"um. Well, my concern is that. It would leave you high and dry after six hours."
12378.0,Patient,"Yes, so I wanted to do the extended release tablets because I did Okay, so I didn't realize, I was supposed to take it because I just have one pill I can't and it's tiny I can't really cut it in half."
298.0,Provider,"yeah and it was one because five six hours later it's burned out of your system, it could even be four hours and so and you're honest for me you're on a starting dose that's not really very much is it helping it all with anxiety. Sometimes, with ADHD people. The root of their depression is. ADHD and then, when we take them the medicine, the depression and then, as a consequence, your anxiety gets better but it's a slow step that we don't just get rid of depression, just because you take a pill."
12378.0,Patient,"yeah well. I don't have I don't have the. So the medication of endless vaccine and the Ritalin is helping. So that was one Okay, the questions in there, so yes it's definitely helping. I am on the beginning dose because I just started with bright heart health like two months ago, maybe, and so I took a while to get the diagnosis and get the medication. And this is the second so he started me on the beginning dose and then has done one step increase when I said this is helping but I need more help. And, and we were going slow, because we were looking at my medical so I have polycystic kidney and liver disease. Okay, so I have cysts all over you know from my brain to my livers to my kidneys to me all it's it's a mess in there and so. We were going slow and checking my blood pressure, at the same time, because i'm on blood pressure meds because of the kidney disease so so we're just trying to make sure that it didn't. Make mess with my blood pressure, thanks yeah. And that's The other reason I wanted to be like okay let's get this down to the amount of doctors i'm working with because of manufacturing was being prescribed elsewhere. and yeah I want to make sure to have very few doctors. And since I had to give up my primary care doctor I don't really have a doctor that knows me, other than my nephrologist right now."
298.0,Provider,And then we're not doing. A service by throwing me in the mix to in the interim.
12378.0,Patient,"While and I wasn't sure. yeah I, like you, guys I wasn't sure I was gonna stay like which way do I go to I go with my new primary care make them be the focus or do I do your thing. With bright heart, I like a lot of stuff with bright heart, though decides, besides filling out surveys and compliance that's kind of annoying because I don't have any shoes, you know looking."
298.0,Provider,"Like and and. And I have asked and asked my bosses, can we lighten up on those and they are like no, we want to know that information it's a possibility that they could have a substance abuse problem and i'm like okay i'm not going to win this fight."
12378.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, and and it does tie into my add I wasn't surprised when I mentioned, I was getting treated through bright heart for add and everyone else in the group was like oh I didn't know you could do that, I mean he. was like yeah. I get that. it's um you know if I wasn't obsessive being functional you would. Self medicate my anxiety more. than I do."
298.0,Provider,"I need to get going, is there anything that I can do for you medication wise."
12378.0,Patient,"I would like to take another step somehow I mean if i'm supposed to be taking the Ritalin twice a day, then I need the pill to be so I can take it twice a day right now it's not."
298.0,Provider,it's 10 milligrams twice a day I did you pick up the. Did you pick up the. 10 steps content seven. Three days ago I wrote it order I can cancel it and go up higher.
12378.0,Patient,"Oh no don't can't well, let me look at what i've got I have not picked up an order that soon. So let's see what i've got covered here. methylphenidate. Take one tablet by mouth oh twice. Twice daily. yeah so I don't read directions well."
298.0,Provider,Okay it's part of the ad.
12378.0,Patient,"It is. So yeah i'll start taking my medication as prescribed. It runs out, and I would really like an extended release like I have for my son yeah but."
298.0,Provider,Try the twice a day and then see how you feel if you want to go extended release after you've done the twice a day i'm sure that myself or Isaiah would be open to that okay.
12378.0,Patient,And is there a way to up my blood pressure is not doing horrible is there a way to up the. Anti anxiety meds just another step.
298.0,Provider,Then Ben left vaccine. or something else.
12378.0,Patient,know the vaccine works well.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I would love to up that i'm. The bangla faxing um. I i'm of the opinion, almost that I would like to cross you over to extended release, but what are your thoughts on that."
12378.0,Patient,"As long as the extended release doesn't mess, again, I always have to be careful with the kidneys. But."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I thought they were I thought, then the vaccine was metabolized through the liver, kidneys."
12378.0,Patient,"Well, I have kidney liver disease this are all over it's all. Either either route."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I have to be kind of careful I actually do for."
12378.0,Patient,have to go in for.
298.0,Provider,"Why don't we do this. To be very conservative. A pain for you, but very conservative why don't you do a tablet and a half a day as the next step. 1.5 tabs. daily. For the five alright, is there anything else, I can do for you."
12378.0,Patient,"know this is helpful i'm just trying to figure it out figure out. All right, stuff so thank you."
