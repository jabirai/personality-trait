2512.0,Patient,"i'm actually we were still living apart, I talked to them, I mean he's my friend and stuff. he's having some you actually got into some trouble because of his drinking oh he's having to deal with that now so. i've just been trying to support him, but i've been trying to keep my distance to like usually on the weekends i'll go, you know hang out with him. In the kids or something, but if he's drinking I won't go you kind of like this weekend, he was like on the vendors I don't know why you know, after all this that's going on, so I just kind of. been away from him for like about the last week, I would say that this weekend, you know we did have fun, but nothing went through so. yeah same all. Like it kind of just I really don't take it to heart anymore, I guess, like you know, like it would really affect me before now I just kind of like you know he has his own place which is nice I don't have to answer his calls or anything like that, if I choose my suit you know. So that's basically where i'm at with that. I mean. I don't know I feel bad for him, I know he's sick I know he's going through a lot of things, but I also think about myself and my kids and i've been really like. adamant and telling them that you know i'm not going to you know you want to be like that you can but i'm not going to witness it, you know i'm not going to be around it so. I don't want to see them be destructive towards themselves so."
105.0,Provider,you've seen a lot of harm comes from addiction.
2512.0,Patient,"yeah. You know I have like a whole nother mindset, you know lately. i've been a lot stronger lately cuz like usually he kind of tries to make me feel like that for him, but i'm like no you're doing this to yourself, you know.

I get mad at her when she doesn't clean up after herself, but like crazy crazy, you know, like maybe she'll cook something and she'll clean up after yourself i'm like oh my God. But i've been like you know you need to do this, you need to get this stuff done as before i'd be like, oh no, you know it's okay to worry about it, but now i'm letting her know like hey this is bothering me and you need to get it done if you make a mess fix it, you know. it's getting better it's getting better i'm getting better at that kind of things, even with my son, too, but we may have my son i've actually been getting my oldest son he's you know he's working he's. he's doing well, good our relationship has been really good he's been very you know the boy just going to work not really going now, which is great. You know he's 21 now so he could be out and about but he's basically just working and coming home and doing what he needs to do you know, like. Oh that's really. yeah I think we're good I can't complain. too I feel like i've been a lot more, you know letting them know what I want. What I expect and stuff.

Dr all them in him changed it so i've been feeling a little better effects of that more maybe like like sweating a little. and A little sick to my stomach. Like nauseous nauseous.

And maybe listen to music, maybe that reminds me of him, sometimes maybe like happy things. But I just like lately i've just been thinking of like memories are happy things you know.

105.0,Provider,are coming up on thing.
2512.0,Patient,yeah because he was always like with us for like you know thanksgiving mother's seems like every. Christmas Eve christmassy we always used to be the color. So it's gonna be a change.
105.0,Provider,Now I can't remember if you had made plans to be very intentional about having some new tradition or ritual around. His presence at the table his presence at the ceremonies of your your religious practices do you have an idea of what you want to do is there a way to start that now get that moving.
2512.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. I was thinking. Well, I was gonna order him because, like I had these like real pretty like all for all my kids like their first stone. yeah and you know, so I was going to order, one for him, which is January, so you know just have like on a tree part of me. And yeah just you know, nobody will forget him. You know, will probably you know talk about him a lot, and then you know the cowboys always play for thanksgiving and him and my son Andrew or they only cowboy fans and their family, so you know they were always all hyped up on on thanksgiving. Halloween to us to always go. trick or treating when when the kids are smaller, though in his neighborhood ago with my niece and nephew. And can. You just. memory."
105.0,Provider,Have you caught your mind drifting over to substance use or have you noticed a surprise that it hasn't drifted over or are you actually substituting with alcohol or weed are you doing anything to reach for a substance when you feel yourself and grief.
2512.0,Patient,"um. I would mean I do smoke weed. I can say. I do, I do smoke like probably if i'm feeling down. or usually smoke because, like, for my appetite and because of like I don't know I always just feel nauseous I don't know if it's from the suboxone or my capra or the mixture of that, but it does help and helps to increase my my appetite and stuff so. yeah and it also alters my mood, but so yeah I guess I didn't reach for that awful hall no i've never been a big drinker or anything like that. I my babying also actually have a really cutting down on it."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, is that right oh look at that."
2512.0,Patient,yeah yeah i've been like. Reaching for it less lately well no it's just kind of starting to like hurt my tests and stuff I don't like you're the owner so like I can't breathe so i'm feeling better now. well.
105.0,Provider,"we'll just keep an eye because. it's just called cross addiction you just move from pills to. weed it's still it's still the same behavior so just keep an eye on it, because you're not going to get the same long term confidence in your recovery, if you come back and. say yourself, all I was doing was I just replaced it with something else I didn't. sit with my sadness. Cry and breeze and draw and talk to friends it doesn't change your wiring you're not healing your brain when all you're doing is replacing with the substance, this isn't a lecture."
2512.0,Patient,These are fans know for sure.
105.0,Provider,"And that's not easy for people to hear everyone loves their weed and they think that. it's not. Self medicating. But it absolutely is. it'll just delay your long term recovery. If you're reaching for it so be very careful that you're not self medicating with that just see it through, we humans were made to be able to grieve. Your won't fall apart okay."
2512.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,So is there anything else that you kind of want to focus on today.
