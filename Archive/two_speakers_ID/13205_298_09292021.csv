13205.0,Patient,What to do.
298.0,Provider,"Well, I i'm really happy to see you i'm so glad to know what's going on with you because I do hold a little bit of responsibility that you are. You know you're okay and i'm really concerned, and I want to talk to your nurse practitioner about your medications and see what she's willing to do. If she wants to sign off on me, being the prescriber then that's one thing i'm happy to prescribe to you, I do think you need a higher dose of the lexapro or you need a different medicine."
