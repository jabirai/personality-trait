462.0,Provider,Hello Erica how are you.
5246.0,Patient,"Oh, my God. it's been a rollercoaster up down it's been. stressed out some days Okay, but mostly stressed out. Okay, well, he got out of the hospital. Last week and then now just today, you went back in."
462.0,Provider,know.
5246.0,Patient,"yeah the pain meds he had the steroids, and the payment that he had. Of course, the last until like an. appointment, I guess, they set up, but they set up the wrong appointment. So we had to go through so we're still going through all these loopholes in shape. trying to find fucking insurance for him. A primary doctor Well he saw Dr. We went to a clinic Samaritan house clinic and saw a doctor there that's not as primary it's not as primary so. But we've been referring back to him, no. Questions and things like that. On what to do so, last night, well, the last couple nights. Well, yesterday I felt like buck in I was using again because he had to get pills and. The doctors prescribe strong enough medication Ram so we had to try to find somebody that had stronger medication. me go get those and then fuckin know just those I mean I didn't I didn't smart gave me yeah it in spark anything with me, but it was more of like. It shouldn't be like this, I mean it shouldn't be this hard so. Last night he's just use a pain, he was crying whole body hurts he fucking head hurt every time he probably took about. five to seven times last night ml and I, and I kind of like when he wakes up I hear I hear slippers yeah I mean, so I wake up and I can hear them fucking popping pills and and and whimpering kind of thing I mean cuz you so much pain."
462.0,Provider,Right.
5246.0,Patient,"so bad like I don't even know what the Fuck to do like I can't help him, you know I mean I. Can I can really do to be there and then. I guess. So then he went today, you went to I to come back to the hospital drop off neatness call came back picked him up went to the hospital he's been in hospital since 930 this morning."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5246.0,Patient,"So he said he feels better but they're doing a whole bunch of tests, so I don't know it's a different hospital. Okay."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so I was gonna say what's their kind of like half for this, you said it might be that he's only going to live a couple months is their options. For like rainbow or what that's what i'm saying they said they said that I, we have to."
5246.0,Patient,"We have to get in touch with the nurse and a neurosurgeon. Neo surgeon new. deal surgeon. And they will. They will let us know more Okay, but the surgeon that told us was the one to look at it scans and everything I guess test whatever this just told us that. He could have this and if it is this, then he has only a few months to live and you need to get in touch with the meal surgeon, and a nurse to explain more. Okay, just leave us daily like that, like what the Fuck like it's hard enough trying and medical for him, that alone find out what the plucky really has so. When he went to the Samaritan house clinic he saw Dr john and Dr john referred him to San Mateo county hospital it's a different hospital he went to so basically they're the ones that would come up with his primary and come up with them. Is meal surgeon, so that place he's out right now is the place, I supposed to be doing everything for him. I mean what i'm thinking like if he only has a few months to live why don't they make him uncomfortable I mean. Live day to day until like and he's gone, I mean they they can prescribe them something to wear either strong enough or something to prevent headaches or body aches whatever it but he's having did you say let them live."
462.0,Provider,"event like a. hospice care or something like that, because hospice can be up to like a year, or even more than that, so that you have some assistance and there's someone supporting him and like you said getting him, making them comfortable that's the. Point of hospice. Have you looked into anything."
5246.0,Patient,"I look. I was looking I was looking up last night about advocates. advocates for. And i'm still trying to get them on disability okay. Right, but he doesn't have a primary so I contacted drawn the one he's seen and asked if he could you know, do the application online for the disability for him to collect his ability. And on the other hand, he has the fuckin we find that though he's friends with the landlord but the landlord I guess called him last night and said, you know when's the money coming in, for this month. You know, and if we can't make it then we got to get out and that. He his wife has. His wife's aunt just that just got diagnosed with lung cancer, so he wants her to have our place so basically you're trying to he's trying to get it get us out of here, so we can put his wife's aunt in here. I mean, but it's like you can't you can't first off, I mean there's two kids me and you mean another cancer patient, I mean you can't just plug in I mean they can they can fucking a big does, but you know. yeah you know what's going on, I guess, and you know Tony went to go talk to him about the landlord like twice to tell him what's going on and to be patient and you get your money when you get your money yeah I mean so basically. That was stressing me out is that we have the rents 2000 we have about 1300 in the safe, and so we got to come up with another 700. But this really is not going to come in till probably next next month, and then I can't I can't even go to work and make side money because I have Charlie. And he can't watch Charlie because he's sick all the time and then, if I leave Charlie with him and then something happens to him. You know, mean something me Charlie we left there by yourself managers and then it's, just like the schedule of. Picking up Nathan and trying to get shit done it's like I can't even I mean, even if I was going clean houses for hammer however many hours and stuff and make a little bit of money. I mean it's I still have to go around all these obstacles to fuckin find daycare get Nathan after make sure I get off before anything gets off like make sure he's Okay, but then. If he get done disability, he said that because he should take care of his dad that was on that bone cancer and he was on. You know his dad was on disability and he took care of his dad so the disability was paying him to take care of his dad so i'm thinking if he wants to disability starts, and I can, I can tell disability i'm taking care of him, which I am. So ready right we'll get two paychecks instead of just one. I don't know but I mean we just it's like when you money now I mean. going to ask he's going to ask his friends and. Then other people, but I mean he's not he's in the hospital right now i'm like do I take that do I take that initiative and do it do I call these people in and ask for help, or do I wait for him, I want him to get upset yeah I mean."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it's yeah you're just in a really tough. position and all the support that you can get is just going to be so important right now, so I know you mentioned reaching out to his best friend was there with his best friend able to kind of talk to him or. Anything it was funny."
5246.0,Patient,"It was funny because I was there I was there when they were talking so when we act like we I like I didn't even like I didn't call him sure, though, and that's what I told us what he told us French I was like don't say I called you because I don't want him thinking."
462.0,Provider,That it turns in yeah.
5246.0,Patient,"Exactly so. He talked to him, he said just you know, keep trying don't give up don't give up. You know just don't let the basic don't let them tell you know."
462.0,Provider,Let me whatever you want.
5246.0,Patient,To get it.
462.0,Provider,Like insurance get.
5246.0,Patient,"It like you, like their steps to take and doors that are open, but. it's like it's like if to door closes closes on them in a space, I mean he'll he'll shut down for the day. Let me show and he's like well Erica us like you know you're doing everything right you're going to be calling these people you're going to be doing this, you know me doing that i'm like Okay, well, I mean Okay, I mean I know. I can't rely on him to do it, so I have to take the initiative and do it, but. I don't. I don't. I don't know what to do when he is not here, let me how do I, how do I. Are they gonna for insurance, how do I call and say hey yeah you know this person needs insurance he's actually in the hospital they're gonna want to talk to them so it's just kind of like back and forth like."
462.0,Provider,"No it's yeah it's really hard well i'm glad that his friend was able to support a little bit. Who can you rely on for some support because you just can't do this alone. Like it's just too much for one person, you can just white knuckle your way through this is there other people, you can call."
5246.0,Patient,"No, no, his mom his mom doesn't even know that he's back in the hospital nine SEC, not only that emergency room his mom doesn't. doesn't want his mom to know too much so freaked out, I mean she lives in roseville for hours away there's nobody really close enough to fuckin. You know, to actually be here I mean like. or even just a party like me, I could. I don't have many friends i'll have I probably have a couple but. I mean. I mean I. He said that his cousin. cousin kira kira and then I guess. These Tracy these two people I mean I know them, I met them but I don't know them like that, and they kind of know they he said they kind of know the system, the case you know the system and stuff but. Maybe I should call her, but I mean How would it. On her I wouldn't rely on her for like. Like moral support you mean like. uber. To getting things done on helping me with that probably yeah that would help."
462.0,Provider,"Well, that could be helpful right that's."
5246.0,Patient,"I just don't I mean. I don't know I don't know how much he keeps himself, I mean like I don't know how much. He wants me to tell these people tell them or or even or even ask for help, like that, like I just don't want him to get upset when I when I mean i'll get i'll get shit done, I mean I will get shit done, whether you know, one way or another, but it's going to involve. People that he doesn't probably want me to contact yet. mean to worry them."
462.0,Provider,"yeah but that might just need to happen, like I said you just over there alone white knuckling your way through that that's just that's a lot. It might you know other people might need to be involved at this point, whether it be for. emotional and moral support or or. logistical support."
5246.0,Patient,Right. I just. My first I hate buck and having a first. Ad. login a like. damn which I was a guy does have lucky share my pockets and as it.
462.0,Provider,Right.
5246.0,Patient,"But it always either have a backpack or a bucking person. always ends up getting fucking way oh yeah. True i'm just digging and digging i'm like what the Fuck is that what. Oh that's not what I want. yeah fucking piece of gum fucking chrome isn't. Like no, thank you. Via it. i'm more worried like. i'm worried about like in the rent like. That would That would be my first thing to do. Like my first thing to do is is to ask everybody for fucking a little bit of help even it's fucking $50 $20 where the fucker is like anybody I can click and ask, I will ask."
462.0,Provider,You.
5246.0,Patient,"To start just to pay this month's rent I mean. And then you know if that doesn't work. and I mean i've i've asked her county for hell for the relief, but this is not a Kobe situation Jimmy isn't that. isn't that is not Kobe really you know this is this is. But. I mean i'm pretty sure I can get people to chip in for the rank."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, that could be a start, just to try to get your nerves down about that a little bit."
5246.0,Patient,"Right and then I think I would definitely stop stressing, because if the landlord wants us out for so his wife's and can come in. Then I don't know if he's even going to take the book and read the same same ticket back and literally say no, you know yeah fucking this me days to get out you mean keep the rent whatever. But you know I asked him, I asked Tony about I said, you know, will he do that will he do that if I was to give them grant money when he fucking deny it, and say no, no move out. And he said no. I don't know. I mean it could it could switch any fucking point and then thinking. If that happens, what the Fuck we gonna go."
462.0,Provider,I um yeah so you're paid for December right.
5246.0,Patient,"No, we haven't paper December, yet."
462.0,Provider,you're not paid for it to summer no okay okay so you're not paid for December yeah. It might be good to try to ask people for help. try to get through this month and maybe look at a backup plan of where you could go.
5246.0,Patient,"yeah I was looking at. People with disabilities and, like the housing situation. And like like disability and their families and stuff like I mean we got two kids I mean i'm pretty sure they can get us, it might take a little bit give me a waiting list, of course, but I mean. I mean if that happens cool I mean you know we have a house, you know, affordable housing or whatever. But I mean that was that was my. That was my my stress to like the guy if you guys I can't keep this fucking place my side that I can't work you. Know basis it's what am I gonna what am I going to do next."
462.0,Provider,yeah it might be worth trying. On those. If there's a a waitlist or whatever right.
5246.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was that's what I was doing last night because he scared me like they will you know. If he was really sick and fucking make you look like shit he looked like fucking straight shit. yeah and you know, I was like okay Fuck it, you know, let me not stress about the rent whatever right now, you know because it's funny because his best friend when I call it last week he knows the landlord and Tony said. If he tries to kick us out and George finds out then George will fucking stop that from happening. But I haven't I haven't talked to George yet about that you know i'm kind of waiting for Tony to do it, but if he goes in today if he goes in the hospital today and not get released that i'm gonna have to call towards for the rent and buck and tell them what's going on."
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I think that's fair at this point, I really do. You gotta call who you need to call and ask you need to ask right now. And I know that's not your favorite thing to do."
5246.0,Patient,"Right. And I mean he's just gonna have to fucking live with them, I mean he's gonna he was gonna do it either way he's going to ask them for help either way but. You know there's no there's no money coming in, right now, nothing no So either we asked for help, or we get the Fuck out so either I will."
462.0,Provider,Either a.
5246.0,Patient,"For him to either wait for him to do it or. You know. he's in it, in that the hospital and it's like. i'm gonna have to i'm supposed to do it, I mean we met me he can be mad at me or whatever I don't care."
462.0,Provider,"You can just keep bringing it back around to like I need to take care of our family period. You know, this is nothing like. against your and definitely don't say this, but against his ego right it's just pure survival."
5246.0,Patient,"Right right because we're kind of we're kind of looking at each other, like like Fuck I mean i'm feel helpless I know he felt helpless like you want to. try to tell me yesterday that you know he felt good for a little bit yesterday, like during the day, both good. And then he was like you know, maybe i'll go back to work, you know couple of days a week, whatever to get some money in and look at him like fucking serious, no, no, like no it's been about like it's bad enough that I can leave Charlie with you and me go to work. You mean he goes he goes like what am I bad dad i'm like no that's not the point they're not the point of me, being a bad dad."
462.0,Provider,"i'm saying yeah he's taking it all really personally and he kind of daily a little bit ego driven and because he's in his emotions, right now, because this is so horrible for him, you know. Right, so you just have to keep reiterating the the non emotional part of it. The like literal like we need a house, we need a roof, we have a. Child this age, I have a child this age, this is what needs to happen. Right not anything against. You it's just what i'm doing to help us survive, I really want you to stand by me and this and we can work as a team, rather than be you know at odds."
5246.0,Patient,"Right exactly exactly. yeah I just want, I just want the kids to have a good Christmas and I want us to have a good Christmas you mean like not to be stressed out about the fuckin rant and you know scared booking eviction notice income. I don't right I don't I don't like doing that hey i've been doing that my whole life I don't. Like it and it's like. I think about you know if that was a happen nathan's go live with his dad i'm going to be homeless with my daughter bucking he's probably gonna be in the hospital like. You know we're more over I can't move all of our stuff it's not I mean I always think I think about the fuckin what's gonna happen, I mean I don't. I have to stay focused and I gotta. do what I can do today."
462.0,Provider,"bring it back to that day to day what actionable tasks, can you rightly."
