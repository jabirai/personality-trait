15364.0,Patient,"We lost our vehicles, so that was a stressor We certainly didn't have a home, we got kicked out of her vehicle vehicle gotcha."
298.0,Provider,"OK. So the thing with. With suboxone is that you've got to not be using 12 to 24 hours because it can put you into precipitated withdrawals. And then. That doesn't feel good, so the longer you can wait from using to starting this, the better. You have narc can. Or can you get an account for you have it."
15364.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and. i'm writing this um you put it in your mouth and you let it completely dissolve nothing in your mouth 15 minutes before or 15 minutes after. It. The medicine is absorbed through the mouth, not the stomach so you're welcome to spit it out after 15 minutes if you want to swallow it, you can swallow it too, sometimes it doesn't taste good so you people don't like it, it might make you nauseous it's worth it. I want to see you every week and I will transfer this to whatever pharmacy. and tell me again how much you've been using a day."
15364.0,Patient,i'll be about a gram a day.
298.0,Provider,"And so i'm going to give you two strips a day, the first time that you use it, I would cut them in half, so that you're got it into four strips for films, you can use just scissors cut it in half it's just films. i'm sending this to the CBS and target. Okay, you have questions."
15364.0,Patient,"Do I, so I just come in here weekly now and do the weekly check in here."
