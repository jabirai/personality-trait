Right and she came over yesterday for what was supposed to be like her, only day here all. Winter break she's not in school right now for really intense like medical anxiety and. I think there's other stuff but she hasn't told me anything she's been back all semester, since August hasn't told my dad is keeping up this huge facade that my dad doesn't know like that is no longer long. So it just it was a lot and in the past, normally when they get together it just turns into huge explosive fighting and yeah actually last time. We did the Christmas visit was when I tried to overdose because I was like I just can't do this. yeah so yeah always always a little bit stressed, I did not love that actually does that was last time i'll be this, but again. that's not true, they both went to my graduation um. But yeah I was just kind of a lot. So yeah. Really really well actually. There were no arguments."
79.0,Provider,that's pretty amazing. That sounds incredible.

15542.0,Patient,yeah I. don't have a really good turn as a preschool teacher honestly.
79.0,Provider,He told me when.
15542.0,Patient,I feel like a giant we see three times.
79.0,Provider,"But they have big problems, you know."
15542.0,Patient,"they're so cute to you. and So I talked to my sister, and she said when she said she'd be willing to do blind leads so yeah I can set her up team that."
79.0,Provider,are already on top.
15542.0,Patient,"We talked about the procedure, so are you Okay, if I like give her your. email address."
79.0,Provider,Please do.
15542.0,Patient,"cool now have to do that. Oh. So long story short, she showed that acclimate cheesy at a blood draw she might have a brain tumor and hasn't told our parents yet. I know it cheesy had a blood draw to see if she needs her. she's a whole disaster, but she doesn't do needles like anything touching like her arm freaked her out she's afraid it's going to snap her and. So she's trying to watch someone else get their blood drawn first, and so, if you want me to get a blood draw we could do it as part of her exposure therapy two birds one stone sort of thing. So if you weren't if you weren't that that's fine otherwise. The last one I did was when I was at ERC."
79.0,Provider,Here yeah.
15542.0,Patient,So it's better.
79.0,Provider,"I mean there's not any huge concerns right now but I mean your insurance should cover it, this is appropriate for the time period. That sounds good so lab check."
15542.0,Patient,And we just.
79.0,Provider,Words yeah.
15542.0,Patient,First call my doctor be like hey I gotta grab checks.
79.0,Provider,"yeah i'm in an I O P program I need a lab check for the records and just make sure things stable, no, no current concerns but might as well check. and have him do you want to write this down. water. I could have our person contact the office with the paper or you can just say I need CBC CA MP, I can tell you the ones."
15542.0,Patient,Tennessee cmt.
79.0,Provider,and iron. Be 12 vitamin D. And that's that's good enough. there's any other concerns. Because you haven't had recent behaviors right no protein know laxatives.
15542.0,Patient,"No accidents, I did purge the other day, but it was like I just old enough, so I hadn't eaten leaking. squared yeah I don't know what that was about."
79.0,Provider,But not was at one time. yeah I was it throughout the day okay. So yeah I don't think we need. Anything else I think all the fashion cover our bases.
15542.0,Patient,"I just call them in San and I open program i'm like, how do you talk to them."
79.0,Provider,"Unless they're like well we kind of need proof, you know but i'll have my person send. Traffic is there some something on the website anyway i'll email you and let you know. there's another question with that. I mean have them do a since you're going to be there, anyway, you know have them do just while you're not dizzyingly recently right."
15542.0,Patient,Now okay.
79.0,Provider,"Just make sure they get your blood pressure. On and do blind weight or say I declined to be weighed you can declined to be made as well. If you don't think they'll do a good job of keeping a secret which most places don't they're just like oh and, by the way."
15542.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. Last time I want to know Jane nervous when I realized, I could say no don't weigh me and I didn't realize my nervousness came off is very progressive of a no don't tell me. So they didn't give me like discharge papers."
79.0,Provider,it's true we don't know how we're going to be received it's so so true it's not your fault it's fine they probably are sensitive anyway because they've had probably angry scary patients before you're not one of them.
15542.0,Patient,yeah. um. How do you want my sister to do blind weights.
79.0,Provider,So what I usually do is I mean what what what's the scale look like.
15542.0,Patient,it's one of the like four scales in the bathroom. And like can you step on it has the number. yeah and I. asked if that matters.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and what I would do is like so say this is the scale right and you step on it. You can step forward or backward or whatever, even if you step backwards us sometimes you can see the number, so I usually just put something to block it from line of vision does that make sense, so like. A book or something like that. So she just so you can't see it and then she just. writes it on a little paper or she just remembers it and email it to me. Now that'd be great and, as far as frequency, I mean you don't need it weekly, but if you want to do it weekly because maybe maybe you're trading you do this for me i'll do this for you kind of thing I don't know. You can, if you want to I don't need it, that often honestly if I just get it monthly is good enough, where you want to be like no every two weeks. Up to you. All right, I want to hear you're eating like would you eat yesterday 25 recall, I always like those."
15542.0,Patient,"in the morning. For therapy, and so I have one morning snack before that so first thing. And then I did the therapy and a bagel with cream cheese and. Then. For my like. my sister came over to one time setup like breakfast part one and part two, so I did like I needed to your fans with them and so they're unhappy fruit and yogurt when she came over. And then for lunch, I had. chicken and rice and. Think, I had a pair."
79.0,Provider,We got parents are good right now.
15542.0,Patient,"On their critical. And then. Honestly, I don't think a snack yesterday yesterday was a really rough day I like I was not going to eat anything."
79.0,Provider,It was precipitating that.
15542.0,Patient,"i'm part of the visit partly it's just been like. The. desert voices are really loud. And it's just been really. I don't know it's been really hard recently and. So I very much felt like it's back to the basics like just one thing after another thing and just like. and And then for dinner. Potato and I thought, like and cream cheese. sour cream and cheese on it and I had a solid. Thanks with it. I heard a banana with nutella and then some you're recovered reasons. that's right, I did not have said yesterday and I felt bad about it, and someone had to say."
79.0,Provider,"Oh that's awesome. um, but I want to know more about the disorder, you know the voices what's the negative like what's the focus what are some of the thoughts."
15542.0,Patient,"Honestly it's like. A lot of the thoughts present themselves as like waiting shape focused but. Like very. obvious. For like just self punishment and like. This weird like recurring idea that. I am both like i'm not sick enough. So I either need to be like completely cured, and in the world like a normal human or like. way back no I suspect B or C. And even then like at that time and still now I can think if I wasn't set not."
79.0,Provider,Even reflecting back yeah.
15542.0,Patient,"i'm good it's like. You know, like how you compare to everybody, like oh wow I never had to go through like concerted weight restoration, just when I went to camp in Colorado and I started eating. You know, like, I was gonna be moving my body, the way I did. I just kind of changed the way and you're like yeah you're looking good and and you know I never I never went to a medical hospital probably should have. But I never did, and like I was never in there, like residential treatment Center I was always in php. And I. I feel like a justify this and I don't really know why yeah like I really think my insurance would not have covered a residential stay. Because that like by the count of like my roommate and, like my treatment team there and, like some people are very close together here, you were really, really bad he's kind of scared that you are. yeah. and Oh, they asked me like how frequently purging and sit through the day. And they thought I said per week. I know. I know yeah and. Then."
79.0,Provider,"we'll do you have something to write with. mean it sounds like you kind of you understand your what's going on right but not sure what to do with it so let's have you right like either I don't know how you want to write it. You want to put like Okay, this is the little wall, this is the front or, this is the water's edge or whatever kind of metaphor, you want to use, but these are the the exterior thoughts that are focused on the food weight, and this is what I think is really driving that are motivating. And most of this is really work for Catherine. So we're just going to scratch the surface, a little bit, but that's kind of why I want you to write it is then you can carry on with Catherine."
15542.0,Patient,"So I signed her with JEREMY did his right leg later, like the actual thoughts."
79.0,Provider,"Actually, the actual thoughts."
15542.0,Patient,"Recognizing. You speak a lot of energy like okay well I usually like Why am I getting actually wanting to that, but now it's like okay what am I wearing the same part of my brain is like Oh, you should wait for that really means that part of the brain just wants to fade away and die. So let's work on the other, stir."
79.0,Provider,Something popped up on my screen for a second Mike what is it killing okay you're back sorry you're just like. keep going.
15542.0,Patient,"yeah I know it's just I don't know, for one, but was there is like second nature, like like something we're going to finish this wait i'm like you guys yeah like. I know what."
79.0,Provider,i'm gonna wise.
15542.0,Patient,"yeah it was like i'm happy to existing like take a high, but. For me there's a middle ground for. switches to do. yeah one of the one of the really interesting, the other day was so back in the spring I gotta dress to go to a job with us with and. If it just. It looked when I was wearing it, I would like you like. sexy Secretary and like a misogynistic male office movie that was directed by like unbelievably horny men with no women on the production team. And it just it felt incredible and. It didn't fit when I came back from Colorado which was when shaq."
79.0,Provider,and
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so that hasn't been a trigger."
15542.0,Patient,"yeah, and so the other night I was talking but I sent me the other day when the preschool was like do like an interview, and yes, I do. But I was thinking like Oh, you know. even know what was recently so it's like. let's let's just try let's just see you know, and I couldn't find it actually morning what happened to you, I think. When it first was driving me insane. So. back up to Colorado So when I was staying in RC I got some cans and they didn't fit right, even though I thought they would and it just like destroy me and I ended up scratching like holes in my stomach. And it was not great. And after that I had. It was okay it wasn't awful it was just extremely inconvenient because it hurt touched my shirt. So. We try not to keep clothes that don't fit around. So what kind of sight out of mind. That just I think I gave it to my dad is like you know quarantine away from the sort of. yeah. So. Oh yeah I went hunting for dinner it couldn't find it."
79.0,Provider,"I mean you just like it would be healthy, to find it it kind of doesn't sound like it aligns with your values anyway. right the way you described it i'm like wait, why do you would you want that."
15542.0,Patient,yeah. yeah it was very much about how I looked out and it sounds like it was comfortable but. yeah.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and it can I can still feel powerful and everything OK, so now you have this kind of drawn right on the paper. yeah OK, so now try and like you know, take a step back from it like right now here it's snowing right it's lovely and i'm in this snowy. You know, land or whatever, right now, so step back and what what environment are you in right now that could be influencing what's kind of playing out."
15542.0,Patient,"Recently it's been fun with a lot of back and forth between my parents. Okay um and a lot of like i'm behind my friends. in life, you know they're all coming into the relationship long term relationships and the career moves and it's like oh my God i'm here. Okay."
79.0,Provider,"yeah so you're feeling a lack yeah. And you're also taking risks with hobbies job interviews, which is incredibly stressful I hate that I can't tell you how much I hate that situation. yeah so unnerving so you are you're in a very stressful situation and an unknown like your identity in a way, is in question, you know, and so it makes sense that you're trying to grab on to. Something that would give you some identity like been sick enough or others, you know so we're going to stop there, because that's really as much as I. should go. yeah, but you can come talk about it. yeah but um. What was I gonna say. Oh before before we leave it. Can you just know that you, you are so capable and you're you know what's going to happen when your life is so full you don't have any room for having a negative thought like that you know. It just it won't serve you and you're gonna be like. be gone, you know, so you. you're just you're in a tricky position right now it's really true you're not imagining that. it's hard."
15542.0,Patient,"for discussion for new. shoes, I was running into so. shiny intuitive eating."
79.0,Provider,"Oh yeah. Right, the we are what we're gonna do which meal was it."
15542.0,Patient,"I did. 33 dentists ended up doing just like a. couple random times honestly I didn't count I think i'm pretty sure I did more than three because I was like an invest in any. yeah um but I ran into like. You know, pushing everything out it'd be like I don't want to. You know it's like i'm done before the food is gone and but not like once or twice like consistently and not like a couple fights like over half."
79.0,Provider,Over half is left.
15542.0,Patient,"and Oh one time, I was like I was like okay i'm gonna do this, he was a snack into. Okay, what do I want to eat, and I was, I was assessing my body but i'm not hungry like I don't want to eat, but I am tired I do want to take it now. And so different like a really long nap and then I woke up and I was like just crazy hungry. And yeah. So talking to Catherine cheesecloth you like felt hunger, since you've been out of your car yes and but like only get really intense levels so."
79.0,Provider,Soft hunger.
15542.0,Patient,yeah she kind of wanted us to talk about like the signs before. Because I think that's what's. giving me issue there.
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah Let me share screen and let's do a little. Like discussion. Okay, so like. Well, if we draw the line. Right of the hunger. You feel like you can know we put a stamp on it here. I guess it'd be down here like a stamp like the extreme hunger right. Like the strong hunger, you can feel. But the softer One the one like right here, maybe it's harder to feel I need to move this see you to say. I go. Okay. And then, what about so it's mostly with the one, though, you mentioned the photo. Like it sounds like you're almost here i'll do a heart for this and it sounds like when you just get a little bit in you, you feel like you're. Right."
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,So.
15542.0,Patient,"I haven't figured out how much is like. See like i'm tired of like. Doing this mentally like my mouth is tired of eating like I want to do other things, and how much is like. restriction I haven't been able to identify."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, really, really good questions. And, and it also totally depends like it really, really depends like. If okay let's just take somebody who doesn't have any eating disorder and they eat like you were wanting to eat where it's just like barely half of it's gone and you're like i'm kind of done. And so they throw the rest of the food away or they package, it up in the fridge or whatever well if hunger shows up again. like an hour an hour and a half later well, they just eat again right if somehow they just didn't read their full right well there's always room to make it up, if that hunger shows up again. But with you, if you're not feeling your soft hunger, you might not catch that right, and you could get into a restrictive pattern which could then lead them, you know behaviors and whatnot. So I feel like we should really work on the hunger first making sure that you know that soft hunger, but also giving you flexibility. To also maybe. Maybe it's snap time you can experiment with you know what I think i'm done and it's half of its left I don't know what do you, what are your thoughts."
15542.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. yeah I guess i'm calling the other day. I don't. I don't remember the context, I was eating. What you asked me. I don't know oh that's right that's right we just like mindful, and so I brought your reasons, like this and. Like we were doing them mindfully and after like. A large bowl because I just kind of our Community and and I did about a quarter of it, and I was like okay like I think that's all i'm done for now. And I, so I set them aside and then I just like I don't know I just kept snacking through the rest of the meetings like you know, over the course of an hour and a half, like one little raising thing at a time. and Then I ate all of them and I couldn't tell like am I doing that because i'm hungry, or because it's there and i'm bored."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and you're using it's like a regulating thing, and I have no idea I mean what's your what's your thoughts about that."
15542.0,Patient,honestly. And it keeps you here figure out like. Something my parents will dig into was like you know stop when you're full don't do it because you're bored which you know there and. Like when I feel like i'm done eating like even when I was in the disorder and it was conscientious my first things that get the food out that don't cheer. And so I don't know it's like that's a Bernie or if that's like i'm actually done with it and I just didn't have like I said on the continent to go back to the kitchen.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and we can we can kind of talk about you know, a child, because you're thinking about being a preschool teacher so that's I think really you could probably picture that and relate to that. um, but one thing if I we talked about the digestive bolus idea and what the ideal time period."
15542.0,Patient,Like a three hour.
79.0,Provider,"yeah the two to three hour. yeah okay we've talked about that, I just want to make sure there's that on board so in general, like snacking over like an hour and a half or two hours you know in general is not healthy for the digestive system. right but it's also not like horrible you're not like sending or make some huge mistake like if you're sitting and watching a movie and you're snacking on something. that's not like the worst thing you know, so what but on a normal basis regular you know that's probably going to be hurting your digestive system, the bacteria aren't going to be as healthy in your gut if that's a regular thing. And so, looking at a child so let's pretend like you're in your class with these little kids and you have your little meal time I can just picture it because I was in a classroom like that, for a little while. Anyway, and they have like the table that I was at a little round table all these roundtables that their little cute."
15542.0,Patient,kid no miniature size.
79.0,Provider,it's also many. anyway. The kids are focused on the food and then what happens.
15542.0,Patient,And they eat.
79.0,Provider,And they start doing what.
15542.0,Patient,Some of the plane sometimes they just walk away.
79.0,Provider,"yeah totally they get antsy they start doing something messin either mess, with their fit if they're not allowed to get up when they're done like if they all have to stay disciplined run the rules right. But they get antsy and they want to do something else, and because their little minds are really wired to do the next stimulation and they're very, very I mean unless parents and other adults or situations have kind of messed with intuitive eating they're very natural intuitive eaters. So you know it should be something where you're like crossed my mind, like, I want to go do something else I need to go, I want to go, whatever it is, like, I want to go to the next thing. And, rather than a manipulation of like. hmm you know I think I want to be done that's good like it's there shouldn't be a ton of decision making in it it's just more of like gosh this kind of isn't tasting fun anymore, and I want to go and do my other thing. and But the eating disorder voice can really manipulate all along the way we can move eating so it's very tricky. So. But let's get technical a little bit on soft hunger and what's What would you think stuff on there might feel like."
15542.0,Patient,I think REACH. cranky and.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so some irritation like that."
15542.0,Patient,"Like. It so. Not like physical weakness, but not as strong as possible."
79.0,Provider,yeah cuz i'm a lot of times it's true like you might be hungry and you don't really have some of those time excuse. want it to be on one line there we go. Wait What did you just say I missed one.
15542.0,Patient,"Oh, like not physically weak. as strong as. yeah."
79.0,Provider,"yeah. And one thing if you if you can smell food. very interested Thank you like you know what's going on, I can like if you work by a. restaurant or you know you work at a place and somebody starting to cook their food in the microwave and you can smell it you're like oh hey that's that's really interesting if you're not hungry at all, or if the eating disorder mindset is stronger than what's that smell going to do."
15542.0,Patient,Or would you imagine well either late. passage and like oh that's good didn't enjoy that. For. So long I would never do that.
79.0,Provider,yeah totally.
15542.0,Patient,On it like get me out of here sort of thing.
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah like unnecessarily strong reaction right. It should just be like oh somebody's looking like and then you're back focusing, whereas if you are hungry and might be like somebody cooking oh that sounds good, like. Your brain kind of settles on it. and I my sentence i'll fix it a little bit funny."
15542.0,Patient,This is where people are when they say peckish.
79.0,Provider,Totally um How would you spell that. For me.
15542.0,Patient,She she can see traces like.
79.0,Provider,Apparently yeah exactly. Every my son had a book and every time I think the birds I think of T REX I like gotta switch that anyway. it's all about how birds are just like our T rexes. don't get it out of my mind kind of. make some scary.
15542.0,Patient,um.
79.0,Provider,"Oh, if you taste food what happens."
15542.0,Patient,"you're like Oh, this is good."
79.0,Provider,"And if you taste, if you eat some food like if somebody is I care you've got to try that you know and you're like you know, then you're probably not hungry unless it's just really. But. Generally soft hunger is going to be kind of thing when you do start eating like oh actually got something I need right now. I can think of anything else can you think of anything else. yeah I think. I think this nails everything. We have to be careful with intuitive eating at this point where the eating disorder type thoughts and that lifestyle is kind of appealing for you right now you're in this really open space as you're trying to find a job and all of that. So I think you should still really stick to the meal plan, but also keep some kind of a journal, and I have of course have journal sheets papers that you can just be like that are all about this right like how hungry, I am I, and any emotions or any thoughts. Just the intuitive eating food blogs typically. i'll see you could do that and I don't, mind you know you stopping halfway through a snack or a meal unless. Unless. it's motivated by changing body shape or. You know, trying to have an eating disorder, because that just feels like more comfortable and reassuring, sometimes it does you're not bad for thinking that. yeah. Do you think you want to do like journal pages and kind of exploring a little bit."
15542.0,Patient,yeah honestly I kind of want to set it up on their covering records and kind of. My need to get back in the habit of doing.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and it's okay if it's not it's not a great fit for you and you want to try a different method. Or if you're just like No, let me do it for two weeks, and let me really focus on. Soft hungry and, if I can identify and myself."
15542.0,Patient,"No, I. I guess I just got tired of like. Being that sake, you know of like Oh, I have to drag everything. here. yeah it's weird like I have to tell them everything, whether they want to know it. it's not really she's not reading it in a weird. kind of way it's more honestly."
79.0,Provider,yep.
15542.0,Patient,"But it's just like okay Well, this is not going to do."
79.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah Okay, I just have it pulled up and they're just looking at your your turned on things and. I don't think we need to urge to binge on I don't think you need to answer that question, but you tell me."
15542.0,Patient,yeah I really haven't struggled with that.
79.0,Provider,yeah that's kind of a default one you know that's just the bar and urge to restrict.
15542.0,Patient,That probably will be good on.
79.0,Provider,"I kind of think that's on to that should be, and then we just are doing the hunger so. hungry is on. there's some like mindfulness questions I could turn on but I kind of just want you to focus on the hunger. Do you want the tired and anxious honor just turn those off."
15542.0,Patient,"like an emotion thing. We can use those. are like does this go to work, yes."
79.0,Provider,i'm shame. On or off.
15542.0,Patient,It goes off it goes like indifferent one menu right little deeper.
79.0,Provider,say it again.
15542.0,Patient,"I last part of that, if you like. If you turn it off, I still have the ability to say like yes it's just not on the screen right."
79.0,Provider,"Okay yeah i'll just turn it off. Okay, how about joy feeling joy."
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,turn it off.
15542.0,Patient,"No, I think needs that it's a good like. counter to anger."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and i'm going to leave feeling the feeling satisfied. Okay. yeah Okay, and anything else we can always add custom questions."
15542.0,Patient,"um honestly I kind of want to do you like. About this, I kind of want to do like hundred before I start, and hunger after. This like because I think. Saying just hunger, at one point is kind of again, I can see myself like it's not specific enough for me."
79.0,Provider,"yeah so how hungry before. My hope this works, sometimes I should experiment on my individual one more often and. They don't have spellcheck i'm so used to it succeed on waivers. Okay, and then add a how hungry afterwards. be smart and paste. And yeah the the failsafe and intuitive eating, you can always eat again. If you make a mistake and you kind of under eight then you're just like. Oh, I don't know why this that maybe you were preoccupied like something intense going on in your life or just a thought and then you're like oh man i'm hungry again so you eat right. But at least i'm not motivated to do that, very often, because that then that interrupts my work or whatever I am focusing on then i'm like was kind of irritating. That, I have to go eat again when I probably should have just eat more earlier, so I want to do better next time, so I make sure I I can wait my three hours because that it's just better for me to be able to focus. So I have it asking meal logs or it's asking behavior logs are asking feeling logs. meal right. Okay, so just try that and see if it works, I mean there is the. The hunger. Oh yeah that's already there isn't a scale hundred were you before the meal and it's going on react to the milk."
15542.0,Patient,No idea if it's there.
79.0,Provider,yeah see if you can find it. And I should turn those other ones. or. If you can I mean we can just use the custom ones we just created whatever shows up in the best spot for you.
15542.0,Patient,"I did not get it, he."
79.0,Provider,Let me back out yeah you're right I probably should back out. When was the last time you logged no i'm nervous I put on the wrong key.
15542.0,Patient,November 17.
79.0,Provider,"I have it on the wrong, let me just make sure yep i'm on the wrong katie that's my thought. Okay let's go back to your logs okay i'm on the right jd. yeah Okay, so let me go through the questions again sorry and swallow and regurgitate you don't you don't need that on to you. yeah and do you still want well, we already talked about what we can turn restricted off right or do."
15542.0,Patient,yeah I think honestly that would jonah the heat in love with anything.

79.0,Provider,"We want to make it as easy as possible, especially with you come coming back to recovery record you want it to be like less taxing. To do. It checking. Can I turn that off to. yeah you're right it's not. Okay. Oh yeah the default ones are on. paranoid that i'm on the wrong one again on the right when. i'm taking it one more time. it's November 17 i'm going to configure long questions. yeah it should be changed every fractures and see if it's on there now. Oh it's just because the custom question that's why it stays on as an option for all of my clients."
15542.0,Patient,"There we go okay. did get it, yes, so much easier okay."
79.0,Provider,"Perfect so yeah let's have that be the focus I think that's lovely and. You can't make mistakes and intuitive eating like that are I mean I guess you can text on a call it mistake but not really. Like it's just a learning process, so if you feel like I didn't quite eat enough well Steve more. or man, I really ate a ton well you're probably not gonna be hungry for a while, so that's Okay, you might not eat your. Like when we have our Wednesday lunches where they bring in food, I almost never eat my three o'clock snack i'm hungry like about 430 instead you know I just because it's heavy heavy food. Just sticks with me longer. i'm kind of want to finish this I feel like it's not finished. You know, maybe an actual hunger point you know or actual like cool. sustains. Sometimes you just have to go well, I think I should eat a little more because i'm you know i've got stuff to do. And then you just gotta push through this hard part in your life."
15542.0,Patient,yeah and.
79.0,Provider,"I feel for you, I really, really hate where you're at like if I was in your shoes it'd be like. I just want to know, and I just want to do my life I don't want this whole unknown thing."

79.0,Provider,"Well, I want you to do your I mean you taught the class on it right like go through it, for me, what is what's the what's what's in it for you."
15542.0,Patient,"Honestly, I just I miss. I. So my. teammates from last year are. graduating in December and so now, the whole team is freshmen and I just I feel like and the coach left shoe so I feel like the whole team is new.

79.0,Provider,"yeah I mean honestly, it sounds fun to me Okay, but do they have to do the flip side, how could it be dangerous."
15542.0,Patient,"And so, a lot of times I do you get really into to learn learn certain suits. and and I know that I like sometimes me check. Another thing was when is that I do 10 like a to bury number focused on something that I personally have like. That was like something that I had to focus on for a while, in sort of thing and. and decided they're not going very far like for a while and better things like if the SLIM is less than 20 minutes or GMOs. But that's because I was doing 5000 6000 a day in season."
