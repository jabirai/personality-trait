480.0,Provider,Hello. hi Chris how are you.
11760.0,Patient,Oh right lots been going on.
480.0,Provider,what's going on.
11760.0,Patient,um me and my boyfriend on a break right now. yeah it's kind of like things like a tipping point or I was like you know why you need to get some stuff together cove.
480.0,Provider,tipping point with the friends situation still.
11760.0,Patient,"yeah it's always it's been always so back and forth with that because they'd go and they treat them like crap. And then we'd be talking about it and i'm like do you now see where i'm coming from and he's like yeah and then like the next day he'd go see them again they're all great again buddy buddy you know, like. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Work on some boundaries, I think."
11760.0,Patient,"yeah so I hit the point where I was just like. You know let's let's take pause like he's in his last couple weeks of the semester of like figure some things out, and then we can get back to that boy."
480.0,Provider,"Oh good. yeah are you I mean i'm sure you're probably sad about it, are you also feeling a little relieved and released from the emotional rollercoaster."
11760.0,Patient,"yeah kinda. Like I do understand like especially like last couple weeks, like all you do is argue and it's like I get my faults from it, but I also get his two. Because it's like I, I know that I got on his ass more about a schooling, because he started ditching class and everything at that and then he started failing. And so it's like got to the point where it's like anytime you have class i'd be like, are you blast. And you went like it, but i'm like at the end of the day, I was like being someone that cares for you in that way, I was like I care for you to succeed, whether i'm in your future or not. And so, like that was like you may hate me for getting on your ass i'm like but it's like that to your future. And like you're throwing it away for people you don't even know. yeah like it's like I knew i'm like I know what annoys them, and it would cause so many fights but i'm like like at the end of the day, that's your future you're failing. And it's like. Because it's like this is."
480.0,Provider,"Like your experience with him to also is good proof that we can't change someone else right, so if we're going to be in a relationship with someone, we have to accept them exactly as they are at this present moment and not expect change because you tried every way you could. Everyone yeah and it didn't work so it's like further proof that all of that emotional energy that you use trying to help him. Was ineffective so in future relationships that's a that's a good experience to have because it's hard to not do that when you care about people like that's, the problem is. Obviously, if you're in a relationship with someone it's because you care about them and we knew care about somebody if you know they're doing harmful things it's really hard not to be honest and truthful. And like now, I still to this day struggle with that, like I have. A lot of friends that are alcoholics or addicts and you know it's still active and it's hard to set those boundaries of I love you and I care about you and also. This behavior is unacceptable and I don't want to. enable it like that's The difference is enabling versus accepting like I know I can't get anybody sober and I can't get anybody well, but at the same time, what am I doing to an able this pattern to continue versus what boundaries, am I setting to take care of my emotional well being."
11760.0,Patient,Good like even like you started getting high with them and it's like that's still like a reoccurring thing it's like wow a full on talking it'll be like i'm done with the next day we're going guy. yep I haven't told him I was like if you're going to go and get high then don't be around me i'm like because I don't care for it i'm like you want to go do that go go do that but there'll be talking to me while you are like.
480.0,Provider,that's a great boundary yeah.
11760.0,Patient,"Because I because I don't care for it it's like when it comes to things like drugs and everything like that it's like. I was talking to my dad about this last night it's like I have a like i'm sensitive to it because it's like it like growing up with my dad it's like they put him on like certain medication like they had him on ambien and stuff like that. Oh yeah and it's like one day it was like he was passed out and he's like office chair, we cannot wake them up for like hours."
480.0,Provider,that's scary.
11760.0,Patient,"yeah we finally got him to wake up and his doctor even told me he's like if they didn't wake you up any sooner, you would have died."
480.0,Provider,And then.
11760.0,Patient,It was for some stuff that I know one of them like ambien he almost went down with us like sleepwalking you almost went down the stairs after surgery with this Walker. I hadn't read one like.
480.0,Provider,terrifying story.
11760.0,Patient,hair horrible thing.
480.0,Provider,Like people driving and like completely blacked out driving because they're on ambien and they're sleepwalking.
11760.0,Patient,yeah and then it's like having that and then like two three years ago my best friend overdosing and everything like that it's just like I don't want to be surrounded by i'm like you're going to do anything like that go for it just not around me yeah. i'm like goes like I don't ever want to see someone go down that path again like.
480.0,Provider,yeah that's super healthy for you.
11760.0,Patient,And then I have my mom's birthday and thanksgiving so I went over to her house. Over thanksgiving because we have thanksgiving dinner at her place and then the next day was her birthday.
480.0,Provider,which was your dad invited for thanksgiving.
11760.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,My mom saying self.
11760.0,Patient,"I know, and I felt so bad, you know go and select that I made me feel so bad if I was like well, I want, I want to spend thanksgiving view and it was like well no go go to your mom and like your sister and everything like that, and like. As I felt so bad and then it's like my mom saying something like Oh, we would have invited him every time i'm like no you wouldn't. Know i'm like I know you you, you would like."
480.0,Provider,And then I go when you were over there. Did you get stuck.
11760.0,Patient,"Surprisingly, no thankfully. we're not there, oh."
480.0,Provider,wow i'm.
11760.0,Patient,so happy.
480.0,Provider,So it's just sister mom.
11760.0,Patient,"It was my mom her fiance my little sister and then my oldest sister was gone because she went up to wyoming with the kids. And then, something that sucked when we were on our way, like my dad was taking into my mom's and we were like on our way I found out from my mom that my grandpa has cancer. Oh. He has leukemia. Oh no Thankfully they said that considering his age, probably won't be the thing that kills in. Probably. 70 something. Okay yeah."
480.0,Provider,"No, are they treating it are they not treating it what's the plan."
11760.0,Patient,I have no idea.
480.0,Provider,that's a bummer.
11760.0,Patient,I know when I found out like my grandma had another seizure.
480.0,Provider,Oh.
11760.0,Patient,"it's like because she think like a few months back and so she had a brain aneurysm. Okay, and she hadn't learned how to read walk again and everything like that i'm like."
480.0,Provider,Then she is married to the grandpa that was just diagnosed with cancer. Yes.
11760.0,Patient,"Okay, so there are my dad yeah my dad's. Parents they I haven't i've never met them they passed away before I was even born. And then, all that was going on and then. And then, when I came home that was in the whole Isaac stuff happened and. This is. A roller coaster for like the last two weeks, like."
480.0,Provider,"So hearing things like grandpa has cancer grandma had a stroke or seizure, what does that do emotionally to you."
11760.0,Patient,"It hurts me because i'm like I hate seeing people suffer. And it's like. my grandparents had always been the kindness to me growing up or anything like that, but like at the end of the day, I still do care for them, considering like the good moments I did have with them. yeah and it's like seeing them pain leg hurts really bad like. Right don't like it like."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I read this with several of my groups today, but I want to read it to you because I feel like you're going to relate to this so it's a book called the empath survival guide. Okay, so what is an empath and pass have an extremely reactive neurological system we don't have the same filters that other people do to block out stimulation, as a consequence. We absorb it into our own bodies, both the positive and stressful energies around us we're so sensitive that it's like holding something in a hand that has 50 fingers instead of five. We are truly super responders research shows that high sensitivity affects approximately 20% of the population, though, the degree of one sensitivity can vary. and pass them often been labeled as overly sensitive and told to get thicker skin as children and adults, we are shamed for our sensitivities, rather than support it, we may experience chronic exhaustion and want to retreat from the world because often it feels so overwhelming. So then. First what's the difference between ordinary empathy and being an empath ordinary empathy means our heart goes out to another person when they're going through a difficult period, it also means we can be happy for others during their times of joy. As an empath However we actually send other people's energies emotions and physical symptoms in our bodies, without the usual filters that most people have we can experience other people sorrow and also their joy. We are super sensitive to their tone of voice and body movements, we can hear what they don't say in words but communicate non verbally and through silence and pass feel first. Sorry i'm past steal things first then think, which is the opposite of how most people function in our over intellectualize society there's no membrane that separates us from the world, this makes us very different from other people who have had their defenses up for. Almost from the time they were born. These traits include a low threshold threshold for stimulation, the need for alone time sensitivity to light sound and smell plus an aversion to large group. In addition, it takes highly sensitive people longer to wind down after a busy day because their systems ability to transform from high stimulation to quiet and calm is slower. and pass also share the highly sensitive persons love of nature and quiet environment so basically I was jumping around a little bit that's why some of it wasn't like entirely cohesive um but, basically, I think a lot of. What happens for you is you're an empath so when other people experience emotions, you also experienced them. And the problem with being an empath is a lot of times, people who are empathic it's really easy for them to be co codependent because codependency like here's how I define codependency is meeting someone else's needs ahead of Europe okay."
11760.0,Patient,"A lot of you, I think I."
480.0,Provider,"See yeah and it's easy to do, especially when you're an empath because, when someone else's upset or anxious you feel that in your body, so you want to take that from them, you want to help them. Right so it's like you meet their needs first and then you're like Oh, but now i'm dealing with the anxiety because I took on their anxiety so i'm. kota codependency a lot of people think codependency means that you just like. can't be alone or don't like alone time right and there's a totally different thing between. Being someone who enjoys being with other people, because that was something forever people used to say, like you, can't be in a relationship until you can be comfortable on your own, and all of that, or like happy on your own. And i'm someone who I really value connection with other people that brings me joy it makes me fulfilled so when i'm by myself i'm fine I can sit with myself, I can have enjoyable experiences, but i'm happiest when i'm with other people. And so I used to think that meant that I was codependent. What I have learned is that that doesn't mean i'm codependent because i'm still able to show up for myself meet my needs first and not take on other people's stuff and try to fix and meet their needs. I used to do that, but not anymore so there's a difference, and I feel like that's why empath it's so much easier for us to become become codependent because. We don't like to feel thing. So it's like, how can we deflect and project and focus on everyone but ourselves yeah so. The cool thing about this book is there's a ton of like fun activities but i'm just gonna say go through those 14 strategies to combat. Toxic energy or like for me I just replace the word toxic with just energy period because sometimes even if it's good energy it's still extra stimulation that I don't need right now, you know. So number one ask yourself is this symptom or emotion mine or someone else's. So perfect example, I have a couple friends that are going through, like real tough stuff right now, yesterday I was so highly anxious all day and. I didn't have any of my own personal anxiety, so that was one of those cases where I was like i'm literally like absorbing their anxiety and I need to figure out how to stop doing that. yeah and then it's ready to breathe and repeat a mantra in your head something like they say return to sender right so you're breathing in and. you're returning the energy to the sender I don't like that three thing, but like return to source or something like I don't have to carry this something like that. yeah number three step away from what's disturbing you so like little timeouts for yourself number four limit physical contact, because a lot of imposter triggered by physical touch to. Some are more comforted it just depends. And then five detox and water so because it is so highly anxious yesterday, it took four baths because, for me, water is like my calm safe space when i'm feeling anxious that's like what grounds me. know in between clients, I was like in the bathtub and it works so well number six set limits and boundaries which you're very good at so that's good."
11760.0,Patient,"Now i'm going to be sticking to them, though."
480.0,Provider,that's the hard part setting.
11760.0,Patient,For someone will cross the boundary and i'm like okay it's fine line.
480.0,Provider,"And that's the codependency part coming out because if you wanted take care of their feelings, because you want to don't want them upset that you have to set another boundary so instead of taking care of yourself you're taking care of their feelings, by not speaking up yeah. Okay number seven visualize cutting a chord between you and the other person that doesn't work for me because i'm not a visual person. plan alone time to regroup spend time in nature and practice earthing get plenty of sleep and take power NAPs take breaks from being online or even just being connected to people like text message like. there's always such a sense of urgency in today's society that sometimes, just like putting your phone away for a couple hours can do wonder. yeah um okay number 12 all about clearing tips for travel we're not going to even read that one number 13 practice, the three minute heart meditation so they have this meditation. Are you someone that does meditations. Okay, so that might actually be helpful for you there's some I mean they're all over, but like I love the guided meditation Center the progressive muscle relaxation, because when i'm anxious, it takes you through like literally your. tensing and then relaxing all the muscles in your body, it like walks you through them and then 14 be fully present in your body so. Obviously, this is a giant book So these are just like tiny bits of it, but I feel like just even knowing because a lot of people who are impasse and that feeling like the book was saying you're too sensitive you're too emotional."
11760.0,Patient,right that one too many times.
480.0,Provider,In.
11760.0,Patient,That are then it's like i'm a conference or it's like i'll start crying and people will be like it's okay to cry i'm like no it's not like.
480.0,Provider,"yeah because we've been told, so many times to suck it up or toughen up or stop being so emotional."
11760.0,Patient,Like my dad called a crocodile tears.
480.0,Provider,"But I find it comforting just to know, Eva there's nothing wrong with us and this book does a good job of like pointing out how being an empath can really be a gift once you learn how to. Stop absorbing everyone else's energy because that's, the main thing is like a lot of people with Depression and anxiety are empathic because we're constantly absorbing all the stimulus around us. And all the energies around us. So it's like learning how to have those emotional boundaries, so that you're not constantly absorbing other people's emotions and energies. Which is hard it's not easy to do it takes, but like you said. setting boundaries so It all starts with like figuring out what your needs are it feel like you have a pretty good idea of what your needs are. So then, setting boundaries to meet your needs, and then the hardest part is sticking to the boundaries that's something I still struggle with is like i've set these boundaries so many times, and now I feel like i'm the one being mean because you're not getting it."
11760.0,Patient,"i'm so bad with boundaries i'll set a boundary and then like a day later the boundary will get cross my be okay it's time. delay I won't even say anything, and I was like oh good. yeah because it's like because i'm always worried that if I set the boundary again or say it again they're going to get like upset and like I don't like people getting mad at me and like yeah i'll be. On my game, if someone raises their voice it you'll be like i'm sorry for yelling really."
480.0,Provider,"Hard so okay so question about that. when somebody else is upset. And you trigger that upset Do you still feel like their emotional responses to your fault. yeah so like in the case of the boundary if you're sending a boundary even if you logically know it's healthy and what needs to be done, you still feel like that's your fault that they got upset."
11760.0,Patient,"i'm so bad, but it's like I was talking to my friend, the other day, my biggest problem when people are mad at me. For like a few hours, I will just be down on myself i'll be like it's my fault, I did this, I did that eventually it'll take a while, but eventually i'll hit the like switch to i'm like you know what I did nothing wrong like. yeah like it, it takes a while. But like I always get to there at some point where i'm like you know what I did nothing wrong i've been nothing but great to that person like yep."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's hard and that's where like so the easiest way it's not easy Okay, then most effective way to. Stop I guess feeling responsible for other people's feelings is just to logically remind yourself that how they react like just like how I react to. Anything in my environment is my own reaction, even if, and so, for me it was easier when I had kids because I was able to correlate like the kids will do something that is completely unintentional that triggers something in me. And because their kids you know it's more unintentional it's harder to see with adults, because you're lying they're adults, they should have known. But, especially with kids it's like I can clearly see that they didn't mean to make me upset the behavior triggered my own emotional experience and reaction. And it's not their fault but it's like it's still hard for me to to flip that around on myself and be like okay well when I set this boundary then my communication upset you but still that's not. that's not my responsibility or fault."
11760.0,Patient,"that's always just been my face from and I can't do it i'm so bad with boundaries so bad of it. And it's like i'm great at giving. Advice i'm great at giving advice, like other people. Yes, I like. Taking my own advice and actually using it that's my biggest problem. it's like even like especially lately it's like. i've been so frustrated because it's like everything that's been going on i'm like I feel like I have ever had like anyone there for me. Like the entire last couple weeks and i'm like i'm always there for like everyone else, and the one time, I absolutely need somebody nobody there. Oh."
480.0,Provider,And it's funny I canceled on you last week.
11760.0,Patient,it's okay. it's. it's just like so annoying because i'm like i'm always like Whenever someone needs me i'm always there. yeah like and then it's like I just need one person and i'll call them and they'll be they'll be busy and i'm like okay i'll talk to you later like.
480.0,Provider,"I so relate to that so much like I got. I got so mad at one of my friends who so we're not in a relationship we're not but we act like we are but, like the boundaries are there that we're not in a relationship so I can't expect him to be my person right. I don't. Know man, the other day I wasn't even like he didn't know, I was mad, but I called him after work and I never call people after work only if it's like I really need to talk because usually by the end of the day, i'm done talking to people i'm like."
11760.0,Patient,"Okay, I can't do it anymore yeah."
480.0,Provider,"But if I need to decompress from my day I call people, so he didn't answer and like 30 seconds later he plays words with friends with me and i'm like okay so you're not doing anything you just know."
11760.0,Patient,show up for me.
480.0,Provider,"One time I need it, I like. went on this re up in my head about how like i'm always the one supporting people and no one's ever there for me, so I totally relate to that, but it's funny because. I also realized I don't communicate that I need people I called him, but I didn't text and say I really need to talk some to someone do you think you could call me back I didn't say that. I could have said that so part of it is still me not asking for what I need and just assuming the other people because me and you are empathic we're pretty good at knowing what other people need. Not everyone around me as an empath so I can't assume they know what I need even though. i'm pretty good at reading what other people need. yeah so you're not alone in that at all and it's still a struggle for me. it's hard it's."
11760.0,Patient,"hard and that's a horrible thing but it's because i'm so good at giving advice I am a great advice giver but it's like I could put myself in my own situation and i'm like well I guess there's nothing I can do like. yeah that's like even with Isaac and stuff like that it's like him figuring stuff out it's like it's not only figuring stuff out himself. But it's him having to figure stuff out with his mom. Because it's like the thing that like triggered the break. was because of his mom because his mom found out that he was still with me and stuff like that, and she threatened to fall and kick him out cut them off financially. Everything like that, if he was going to still be with me and I even told about was like look I was like you're going to get to a point, though I was like there's a difference between being a parent and your mom looking out for you and your mom being on a power trip. yeah and i'm like. i'm like and she's using this against you, I was like have you guys, I was like a time you want to do something that makes you happy her answers always no and I was like you need to like talk to her and figure out like Why is her happiness not important to like to her. yeah because it's like. Go hang out with friends he's not allowed to not allowed to have a girlfriend he was barely even allowed to get beyond the rugby team and it's like he's an adult and it's like."
480.0,Provider,yeah it sounds like she's got a lot of anxiety that's coming out as trying to. Control people around her.
11760.0,Patient,"And, like every home, I was like you're gonna have to you're gonna have to get to that point where you're gonna have to stick up for yourself and be like well, I am an adult and my happiness does matter and so that's yours and it's like you guys need to like come to an agreement like. i'm like whether i'm like whether that means you coming to an agreement still living there are you moving out and i'm like I get it, because it's like he's scared because it's like she paid for everything."
480.0,Provider,Right. And that area at that age.
11760.0,Patient,"And like I told him I was like I was like yeah that's your. Future and everything like that I was like but, at the end of the day, I was like you can go all throughout college and everything like that and have your future on track, but are you going to be happy. Right i'm like because at the end of the day, it's like you don't live a super long life like do you want to waste a bunch of it just not being happy and doing what everyone else wants you to do. yeah like and i'm like I was almost like whether that's with me or not with me, I was like you're gonna have to do that at some point i'm like is your happiness matters at the end of the day, like."
480.0,Provider,"or not there's some men that are still that attached to their mothers well into like their 50s. I mean it's not pretty it doesn't go well for them, but he can keep doing this it's just."
11760.0,Patient,"Oh, I know."
480.0,Provider,"Oh man Okay, so I have you scheduled again next Thursday already right. Yes, yes, at three o'clock. Yes, okay perfect. Is there anything else we have like three minutes left anything else you want to be."
11760.0,Patient,"I still haven't really been doing much not ever leaving the House never doing anything, because I have no one to hang out with. That is anytime my one friend ariana anytime I call her, she always just be like oh sorry i'm busy right now, or like I called her and. The next thing you know she'll be like okay i'll call you back and then she texted me to be like oh sorry I called you back this person called and then I ended up going out i'm like okay cool like we were just talking and having a conversation but. Last time I hung out with her it's been like. Well over a month."
480.0,Provider,It was it was Isaac and her together.
11760.0,Patient,I think we hung out with one more time after that and then she have hung out in the sense because she's always like doing her own thing i'm like but whenever she has problems with her friends and she comes running to me and i'm always there. were just so frustrating.
480.0,Provider,just want you to meet new friends.
11760.0,Patient,I know me too.
480.0,Provider,How are we going to find new new friends.
11760.0,Patient,"I have no idea, no clue I have like my online gaming friends, but like it's not the same and it's like. it's something I was talking to like some of my friends, the other day and they're like hey we're your friends what is that supposed to meet Ashley we talk every day and i'm like. yeah i'm like i'm like you guys are great friends don't get me wrong i'm like I can call you guys I need you guys i'm like but I don't have anyone I can actually go out and do something."
480.0,Provider,"Right you can't say hey let's go to the movies, today you."
11760.0,Patient,"know I know it's like we can watch movies online watch TV online or something like that, together, but i'm like I actually only sometimes I want to go out and leave leave the House and do something and i'm like. I don't have anyone to do that. yeah and i'm like that's what I need sometimes like sometimes like I just need I need to go out. But I will I will. go out and myself, like."
480.0,Provider,"Right. So you need someone that's going to motivate you to get out in the House basically. yeah hmm. Okay i'll brainstorm on ways we can meet friends after you do that. All right, well have a good rest of your week i'll see you next Thursday."
11760.0,Patient,You too.
