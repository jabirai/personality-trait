14926.0,Patient,yeah um i'm not sure if she's still going to refill them or not now i'm in in between places so i'm not sure if that's something Sharon is going to do or. I have one medication that i've run out of that and I called to talk to the prescription people so hopefully they're working on it.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, great so. bright heart health really got you know, a really solid tell a psychiatry so likely all of your psychiatry needs meaning your medication or it's going to be managed through by current health. Okay, but you're are you said you already made a request for refill is that, through your primary care doctor or through us."
14926.0,Patient,Through you guys.
383.0,Provider,Okay okay. OK so i'm just going to. add something here.
14926.0,Patient,"Actually, let me revise that they told me I when I talked to them, they told me that I. couldn't. I couldn't make the the refill request yet, and that I should wait and talk to Sharon when I have my next group class so that's that's the response that I needed to give you."
383.0,Provider,"I see I see um so i'm just going to take a quick look here. And to see who you're. So just just so that I. kind of give you a little bit of information here. i'm just going to look at your chart here, which I have access to which is really great. Because I can see, you know all your appointments and. Who they're with and everything."
14926.0,Patient,cool.
383.0,Provider,it's kind of kind of like the county like that I can just.
14926.0,Patient,Put your.
383.0,Provider,Did you so it looks like you had. The new. Did you see a doctor about your medicine i'm not.
14926.0,Patient,"Now I haven't seen anyone, I mean the easiest thing for me to do is just to have my doctor do the refill since i'm not having an easy time getting right heart to do the refill."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I because you haven't seen Sharon one on one yet doctor."
14926.0,Patient,I did see our one on one.
383.0,Provider,You did.
14926.0,Patient,"not responding to my request to have my my. gapper Dean it's a new or gabba gabba something. Tell him. And, and that when I ran out of, and she hasn't responded, I think I may not be going through the right channels, I went through prescription there's a clinic that is just prescriptions and I talked. To them. So That was all I could do, hopefully they're on it, I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, it says. renewal for gabba penton. yeah and. That has been. So I think you just want to follow up with the virtual clinic to see. You can follow up and say is this been a day working on this, I don't know if I can I can't tell the outcome of that. Okay, so. Okay, so let's just. If it's been refilled by your primary care doctor and she just regularly refills it and you could call them and say look I just need a refill right now i'm kind of in transition, and if they."
14926.0,Patient,Have it once a new one that Sharon prescribed.
383.0,Provider,"Oh okay well if we prescribed it then definitely you want to go through us for. yeah yeah yeah and so, how it works sharing I mean Sharon heaven is that you're going to be seeing your prescriber your doctor the sometimes they're not they are anyway, the person, that is, can prescribe your medication Sharon you'll see her weekly in this group and a group. And that's when they will ask you how are you medications working do you need refills etc so you'll have that weekly contact, so that you can give you know some feedback about the meds and or get refills and so forth, so that's. Okay yeah that's how it works with that."
14926.0,Patient,"My concern is it's in the middle of the day, on a Wednesday, and I have to work, I mean there may be days that I can't do it and I don't know if that's okay. well."

Well, I just wanted to give you a little bit of information about those groups. And just kind of how it flows over time. With, particularly if you feel anxious about. Being in contact with people you don't know you know. Initially it's going to be it's going to be hard it's going to be uncomfortable I imagine for you. And it may remain uncomfortable for a while until you slowly develop a sense of connection with these people, and I know it seems like it's impossible to do over zoom are really hard but it, it does happen, it can happen, I have a group. That I run where I really feel I mean people will say you know this is kind of like us little second family to me. Like they look forward to their group so much because they're going to see the same people they're going to hear from them, they support each other and. it's a safe place for them so just give it a chance, even though in the beginning it's going to see you're probably not going to want to be there and it's probably going to be hard. But over. Over time, you know you want to give it time because you'll see some of the same you'll see the same people, hopefully in the group they'll be people that pop in and out, you know. That happens, sometimes, but it will be a consistency that starts to happen, and I think you'll feel a sense of connection, but I think it'll it might take a little bit of time, but it does happen. So I just wanted to share that with you."
14926.0,Patient,Thank you.
383.0,Provider,Now okay.
14926.0,Patient,willing to try.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and like I said it's probably not going to be fun, the first month or two you're probably going to struggle with it, but I think over time.

14926.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,yeah So what are your goals for their be.

So just be proactive that's just and I know it's kind of exhausting but you want to be proactive if you. need to have a question answered with regards to your medications just you know leave those messages I can also message her as well if there's something that comes up for you, I can send a message through our enter enter systems here. Thank."
14926.0,Patient,You for that i'm almost babbitt whatever because she doesn't seem to have been able to get that message.
383.0,Provider,"OK OK, let me just see if I can send. Okay. So. It looks like that you missed a group on the 22nd."
14926.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's. that's an. Important that you get to your group, so you can. communicate because it looks like. It says that you can verbally call it a renewal for this prescription."
14926.0,Patient,I can.
383.0,Provider,"that's what it was relayed to you from this from from what I can see here in the last communication about. which was yesterday, I guess, I guess you had group yesterday, but you."
14926.0,Patient,didn't go.
383.0,Provider,"Right so that's. that's why get into group is really important. Those surveys also need to be done every week so. yeah. The surveys are not just a one time thing they're there to be done weekly, and they should be done prior to your group appointment. So bright heart health is open from like 4am to 9pm and it's also open on the weekends, so if you need like. help with the surveys, or if you need you know to just check in with someone to help walk you through something just letting you know that that they are open, really. Extended hours and that's that's Pacific time so that's 4am to 9pm during the week I don't know what their weekend hours are, but they are. They are open on the weekends as well. So i'm seeing here that. Your surveys are up to date, apparently so they're not do till next week, I mean the new. Your next ones I know it's a lot but it's it helps it's actually really helpful and just try they're very short just try to be as honest, as you can on those surveys. And over time we really see either you know, things are getting better or things are not getting better so they do track how people are doing, and it does make a difference. So. So see here. Okay. Okay. So yeah you can call the virtual clinic prescription department and they can help with it because there's already a note in here to up your prescriptions, so I don't need to do another note because there's already a note in here that's was was just put in recently. pharmacy what was that."
14926.0,Patient,Perhaps I just need to call the pharmacy.
