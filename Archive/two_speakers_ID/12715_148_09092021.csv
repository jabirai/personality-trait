148.0,Provider,Okay um and how long do they want you in treatment for.
12715.0,Patient,"Probably at least until. I mean, so I so my plan originally was to like I wanted to do something independently also anyway, I just never got around to it like I said, but they wouldn't want me to continue at least until the point where they drop everything so that would probably be. My PD says realistically at minimum until January of this year, potentially like six months to a year. And then, after that I don't know if I would I might continue with with bright heart and then see how it goes, or maybe, just like find a like just a do some like other independently counseling once a week or something like one on one or something so yeah."

148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you don't see that it's a problem to be around them, and you know any triggers coming."
12715.0,Patient,"On I don't think it's. I don't I don't think it's a huge trigger for me, I mean, partly because I know. Like I know enough of how it will affect and even or even if i'm around like too many other people it's not like a good idea, you know what I mean like so."
148.0,Provider,And you don't use more when you are alone right.
12715.0,Patient,"Well yeah I mean it's I mean I i've used it socially for like you know 2015 years whatever. problem happened like started like five or six years ago, when I start when I was living alone after law school and then I started. I mean, I think, mainly because, like yeah from like one of those like one of the friends who didn't come up, but I was able to get like super cheap because. And so i've had a lot of it available for really cheap and I had a lot of money, because I was making a lot of money, and then I was living by myself, so I had a lot of time alone. One and then I wasn't dating anyone at the time."
148.0,Provider,That was also just after a breakup Is that correct.
12715.0,Patient,"No, the breakup was was more recently, but after yeah. I was, oh no no well there were yeah I mean i've had to break in the past five years, but one. The first one, we were long distance anyway. Okay, and then we did break up like around like 2016 2017 and then I did have yeah. yeah so I wasn't seeing anyone, and I just have a lot of time I was working a lot and I just had a lot of it available so."
148.0,Provider,And that's when you really notice this shift and it started being a problem for you.
12715.0,Patient,yeah yeah. i'm. going.
148.0,Provider,To use like when you were in your most recent relationship where you using as.
12715.0,Patient,"Much I didn't even when I was there, I mean I had like a couple times, where they're like a couple weeks over like two years where. I did, use and she wasn't you know, the first time it was like a you know because she knew also and I was like. yeah i'm just going to do this Kevin are you cool fit and we are, we are also long distance, but from La to the bay, so we would like steps, but not, but she just happened to be down and she's like okay. And then. I started, of course, I was like turban and then I called her just like with me like what the Fuck is going on, you know so like at once he saw kind of like how. Like what the effects were and stuff then, just like well you're not doing that to the end so. yeah it was no problem, like it wasn't an issue with me, I mean honestly I mean not know that this is the biggest issue, but I was thinking about this. Like the last time that I was like you know I want to go somewhere. But um. I guess at some point I just. know what happened to my impulse control as far as like even in the moment because, like I used to. Because I remember how much I would do socially and like even before that, and even around the time where I would start you know and it's just like. Even if I do take something like if I take a line or something like there's nothing. it's just so easy for me to do it like like 30 seconds later, you know, without that kind of thing that's like. Probably at the very least. it's probably at the very least, like you know, like pace yourself, so that you don't get out of you know what I mean like I just I don't know I just was thinking about that last time but but anyway yeah so that was around the time work, I kind of like."
148.0,Provider,How are you feeling in your recovery today.
12715.0,Patient,I feel pretty good.
148.0,Provider,"haven't use. For about a month now, you said."
12715.0,Patient,"yeah like I said there were there were a couple times, where I did, since I got out of jail on June in July or June yeah the last time was probably around a month ago. I feel like that some one thing that kind of like helps me. Is and I know it's like kind of silly when even just having like you know, like. The last day was like the last day of the month, so like the day, where you know you know what I mean so like the first day, where I didn't do anything was like the first of the month, or just having like a milestone kind of thing. That I mean as or even just like I mean right now it's I mean I don't. Like I like I said i'd never get like cravings or anything, or like I mean you know, sometimes when they go it's possible I could go get someone it's number like anything that I have to like really like fight that hard you know what I mean interesting."
148.0,Provider,"Interesting so you don't have really strong urges that come over you that is like. No, you start obsessing about getting in and."
12715.0,Patient,"Though, no, no, I don't I just have. I just have really poor impulse control, I guess, like I like. The like if I do get an urge it'll be like Okay, I have some money so right and I have some time, obviously, am I getting the hotel and like you know. Like trying to fill my time, but I have some time I could get some it's not really anything that strong when it's like I just don't you know it's like Okay, well then, why not, you know what I mean. But then, on the other hand, if I put even just like a little bit of effort into just like okay well i'll just why should I like i'll do something else, like read a book or whatever. Writing whatever it's it's not it's not an issue at all."
148.0,Provider,Are you finding yourself starting to think about it more now when you do start to think about going yeah no.
12715.0,Patient,"I probably I probably think about it, less."
148.0,Provider,"No, no, I don't mean like that, like when it does come up for you like Oh, I could go get some right now right you're feeling bored or. Are you starting to think about like playing out the tape like we talked about like that behavior chain has that come up for you at all, where you're able to use that tool."
12715.0,Patient,"yeah you know I guess. To be honest, it hasn't really I mean yeah definitely like a couple times, probably. But it hasn't come up as much because I don't even like thinking about it as much. And, to be honest, like like I said it's not really that hard for me in any given time so like a couple of times like after we like a couple times after we talked about it, which was like three weeks, no more like three weeks ago. yeah I mean I definitely did use that as like you know why should I do this it's just going to lead to like you know, like me just feeling like anxious like wasting time wasting money and that did help. And then there were like one or two other times, where I just was sitting around and I just thought you know hurts me, and it was just. That didn't even come up by was just you know I just thought okay well why should I do it i'll just you know there's something else there's a giants game on I could watch right now. that's coming up that i'm that i'm gonna watch, you know so."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah good replacement behaviors. And then. eventually pass for you.
12715.0,Patient,not have. Not yeah it passes. yeah.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good good what could you see as a setback for you. What might lead you into old behaviors that."
12715.0,Patient,"isn't that I see as a step back, is probably honestly having. More disposable income. And the a similar manner free time. So. For example, I think that if I had like. Like just as an example, like if I say it kind of goes hand in hand if I if I had more disposable income, but I was doing like a nine to five thing. I think I would be more successful at not doing it because they would be thinking okay well if I do this, then at 9am tomorrow i'm going to be like in just a terrible state."
148.0,Provider,Right right.
12715.0,Patient,"But if I didn't have like an obligation until like you know afternoon or something and then I. had more money available, then I would probably I think that would be a thing."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay. What could you do around that.
12715.0,Patient,"I think just maybe it kind of expanding like a decision making to like I mean because. it's a good thing that I. guess two good things that kind of have a silver lining is that one is that, though my substance of choices is expensive, I guess at this point so i'm not like doing i'm not like you know never, never been into like math or anything like that. Just like you know, an eighth of the price. And also that the people that I know who like friends of mine who have been able to get it to me really cheap at this point, I like no we're not doing that for you anymore."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah it sounds like you need something to hold you accountable, especially around money does that, like if you're having time feeling bored and having money. sounds like big triggers for you."
12715.0,Patient,yeah I think so.
148.0,Provider,yeah so something to really hold you accountable around those things.
12715.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,is important but i'm glad that you have those friends in your life.
12715.0,Patient,"yeah they you know. I don't think I mean I told them the stories, but I don't think they realized how like like how really kind of serious it was until they actually saw me like tripping out like you know what I mean so. Then they were like okay well yeah."
