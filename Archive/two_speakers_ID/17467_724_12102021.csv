17467.0,Patient,For what.
724.0,Provider,For mental health or substance abuse or anything like that.
17467.0,Patient,"All the above. So, ideally i've been to rehab twice this year. Once last year, once a year before that. This year i've been to the emergency room four or five times for alcohol abuse and depression. Just this last week, I went in for depression alcohol abuse and I went into behavioral health hospital which. I was just reaching out and I lied to get in there and it wasn't even what I bought it was, and it was stupid of me to do, but I was really, really trying to find somebody. To help me with my underlying issues and because my therapist and I had just parted ways and I don't have a psychiatrist and I didn't have a therapist and one that was specialized in kind of what I was going through, he was helping me more with a divorce than other stuff."
724.0,Provider,"All right, well sounds like whoa. I guess that the answer. You should be I guess the answer to the like the question would be is a good chance that you've done one of these SS SS as before, since your dentistry of it so. Ultimately, I would ask you a bunch of questions or you know pertain to your like your principal history of mental health history substances history and then after that."
17467.0,Patient,We come up with.
724.0,Provider,"A game plan how we're going to treat it so. Okay, based on your read that you gave me and sounds like. you've already answered these other questions on the assessment will clean it up so. Real quick, you said you and your therapist parted ways what was that."
17467.0,Patient,"um. About I think it was after my last month was last month we're on October, I think it was or early part of November okay okay."
724.0,Provider,I just want to make sure that there hasn't been like a significant break like continuity of care okay.
17467.0,Patient,"Well, was enough to where I did what I did just within the last three weeks, yes."
724.0,Provider,"yeah okay. So yeah i'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions at any point during the assessment if you feel uncomfortable you don't feel like answering because of a total stranger that's fine we'll table it will revisit at a later time. right out of the gate. What they call a mandated reporter, which means that I will report to the authorities and a child abuse any elder abuse and then any expressed homicidal ideations stuff of that nature okay. As far as your protection goes you're covered on their. Confidentiality laws and hipaa and stuff like that, and essentially That means that I won't release any of your personal information regarding what is said here treatment medication anything like that, without your express written consent. Right, even after I get your express written consent, through the form of like a release of information. It say somebody that you agreed to at one point for me to talk with maybe a therapist maybe a family member, whatever it is, say they call me they're like hey tell me something about why and i'm going to be like I don't know what you're talking about. You know I played all right. yeah i'll confirm or deny. Because things change. So I would reach out to you and be like hey so so so sorry the contact me they want to talk about xyz, what do you think you could be like. yeah cool yep I agree to that, or like yeah I don't talk to that person anymore so i'm going to pull that release so ultimately you're covered everything that's said here stays here, with the exception of the things I. disclose earlier about like safety stuff like that."
17467.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,"These things are recorded obviously that's what telehealth is, but nobody has access to this, you know, except for the the Agency with bright heart. And in order for anybody else get access to this, it would have to come in for like legal subpoenas and stuff like that so you're covered same thing that would happen in a hospital setting medical setting your records are confidential without. Without your express consent, nobody has access to all right. All right, so if you have any questions or concerns before we get started any questions about bright heart or me or. anything like that."

You know methadone or suboxone and stuff like that on primary alcohol or a primary substance abuse. With something obviously some explosion, the underlying issues with mental health, so I have to go very good cursory understanding of how to deal with mental health concerns because most of the. time we work in this field, everything is co occurring so either people are using drugs and alcohol to address underlying issues or people started using drugs and alcohol and then develop other line issues, so you know they go hand in hand right."
17467.0,Patient,yeah.

724.0,Provider,"All right, I need developmental concerns reading reading comprehension."
17467.0,Patient,"know, I think that, reading i'm not very good at reading and just trying to retain stuff as difficult but that probably goes hand in hand with the alcohol and the anxiety and depression and medications i'm on so yeah for the all inclusive."

17467.0,Patient,"Just like you said, the underlying issues.

And I just have a lot of underlying issues because there's times like get it out throw it up, but i'll go right back and i'll drink it and then. I think like I said there's a lot of depression i'm on a lot of medication lot of anxiety. i've had some quite a bit of past trauma. Maybe then some phobias now have developed a little bit due to low bid, I think. But more so it's. Abuse. in many different ways, and so, and then I was reading an article about abandonment today, and maybe I suffered from a little bit of that too, I was reading all the little symptoms and different things like that."
724.0,Provider,So check some of the boxes.

17467.0,Patient,"I never said I would tell myself for it man so kill myself, I never said that I heard anybody else it was well or you know you could die from this drinking i'm like yeah i've been doing it. Right and they tell you I go to the doctor all the time they believe you're killing yourself, and then the next thing I know it was yeah. Okay."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean i've been involved in many of those types of situations to where like people are you know, under the influence and it I used to argue it to where it's like. You know, we could take say see somebody came in, who was intoxicated clearly right. And they're like yeah I want to kill myself and it's like and then we're like oh God, you know what I mean like alert the press that we get all you know strung out and. You know, we want to make sure that we do everything we can, and it's like, but when they come in a drunk they were like I just want to go home."
17467.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I know we don't take that at face value we take when they when they indicate self harm is like being truthful and forth right. But when they're drunk and they're just like I don't belong here I don't know what's going on, I just want to go home were like oh no you can't make that decision, you know I mean so like I used to like ethically. Or maybe just morally like be like I just find it very frustrating, you know what I mean it's like, how can we believe what they're saying to be true when their blood alcohol levels at a 400 right."
17467.0,Patient,yeah i'm sure i'm.
724.0,Provider,"not making any sense at all. But we're going to pretend like that's because what happened was just like in California, they call like where you get put on a certified hold and you don't have a choice you can't go anywhere it's not up to you anymore."
17467.0,Patient,"Right, so what happened to me."
724.0,Provider,"Right, so you get you get 5158 and it's like okay for the next 48 hours or whatever it is you got no choice, no control over your own body right. And we would do the same thing here at this stage it's called a certain like a certified hold emergency start hold and sometimes people will like in the nature of the mental health. Business as it is, is so inundated there's no space and not enough workers so somebody might come in on a Thursday night at that awesome and i'm sure this happens everywhere. Get on our whole because they were so drunk that they said something so stupid and now they're going to be there all weekend. into Monday or Tuesday by this time there stone cold sober and they're like I still the network, we had a fight with I just turned into like a huge disaster I think that's, just like the state of the mental health field."
17467.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"there's just not enough funding or staff or research, of whatever it is, but things like that. It used to like it used to really bother me because i'm just like why don't we take that at face value, but you know I mean why don't we wait until they wake up. You know, and we will we can test them again because there's like a clinical scale based on your blood alcohol level how many hours, you would have. On average, before you're legally stone cold sober where you can start making. Like like conscious choices and making sense it's like what we just talked to them, you know in 12 hours when they wake up before we start arbitrarily being like yeah they wanted to shoot up the entire hospital staff but it's like can we be reasonable here for a few minutes. Later, was not assuming that's what they were going to do anyways like that you could barely stand right. So I just think it's not enough education, like a lot of people's part that's my tangent so sorry to practice that what you're saying like."
17467.0,Patient,"Like it is i'm right there with you man because, like I said they. must get me like six or seven days in the hospital and then. You know, then they filled me for stuff and I still I was out of it, I mean, even when I was over the behavioral health and I was like man i'm still kind of. Out of it yeah yeah and and obviously alcohol takes quite a bit of time to to clear your system and they plan to get back to a normal state, and you know and clear thinking and. Body function and everything so. yeah. Like."
724.0,Provider,"three to five days like like the average three to five days for the body to kind of kind of bounce back, but it is dangerous, when people are detoxing from alcohol it's. You know of the two between that embeds those are very dangerous can't really cold Turkey alcohol on your own so like if it ever gets to the point where you're like i'm just never going to do this again if you had been doing it. cold, Turkey is not the answer you do need like medical supervision, because seizures happy people fall the crack their head open in the refined so like I had tons of patients that. Like I would see and it would systematically come in with lots of bruises and then eventually, I would just stop seeing that because they. blacked out hit the head and nobody found for three days ago, what I mean so it's one of those things like it's very dangerous when people are trying to kick it because the chemical dependency part of the you know the addiction. Is the physical withdrawal Center so it's like you need the progression of us and a tolerance happens as a result of that, and then, if you stop. And you have a physical withdrawal SIP of that that means that your body truly was addicted addictions like a like a medical sense, it has to check those three boxes. You could be like you have an addict not have that third party you're like okay you're just a behavior part like i'm talking like chemical dependency concerns where it's like my body doesn't function without it. Right yeah. It does it operates in such a dangerous state that I have to go to the hospital that's to me a lot like a real problem right of. But alcohol bentos it puts you at like the most physical risk, for you know adverse consequences that's why it's important to go to the hospital right so just so you know. don't ever cold Turkey those two things ever. Like very dangerous. So any history of self harm and the past suicidal thoughts behaviors attempts."
17467.0,Patient,No.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, any homicidal thoughts behaviors attempts. I, you said you had a history of trauma you want to. get into that a little bit emotional abuse."
17467.0,Patient,emotional abuse abandonment issues. verbal abuse. Sexual abuse.
724.0,Provider,"Now, did you witnesses are we, the victim or. Victim okay."
17467.0,Patient,"And yeah, then I got very, very narcissistic boss over the last few years or four three and a half years ago, and I was working underneath the five years, and she screamed at me every day for five years. i've been a part of the California wildfires so i've seen complete devastation i've seen. You know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of houses just gone worked in the middle of it bodies being found I didn't see him but it's still. You know, you can see they've marked it off they're all digging cadaver dogs and in Iran, you know I kind of supervising supervisors, but I ran kind of cruise of 30 guys five crews and we go to all these emergency situations with brainstorms wind storms fires. I went to hurricanes and Florida. So i've seen a lot of."
724.0,Provider,devastation this. Which are it has a Florida.
17467.0,Patient,was one sorry I can't even remember the name of it. I forget it was like five years ago. yeah but we were in a nice area we're like well I think it's all like PG West or something I forget. He was like yeah something like Venus Williams and 300 million dad lived there and it's like one of the big major all the major golf courses are there and. It wasn't. Too bad.
724.0,Provider,"I live in Florida for 15 years I was stationed I was in the military, I was stationed down. Just just east of Alabama so like like like we're Florida is kind of like Florida comes across like this and then it drops down into like like the phallic that everybody knows that Florida looks like, but it really it's called the panhandle of Florida. So, like that whole little section at borders, you know, Georgia and Alabama and then it trickles of Alabama I was stationed like up in the corner right outside of like pensacola Florida last major city before Alabama. I was there for hurricane Katrina hurricane Ivan. yeah like disasters like it was crazy so when he's talking about like hurricane stuff it's like oh yeah."
17467.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah and I was on the west coast, and then we went to the east side, so I can't remember, I will kind of."
724.0,Provider,"Her. Spare quite. inspiring and all those things and chaotic so yeah I went through like a bunch of articles, while I was down there not fun definitely not fun. yeah it's one of those things where it's like you can kind of it's Nice because you can plan for it because they know whether or not it's going to call but that it's like if you own property it's like well I can't leave my house because. You know people get you know houses get broken into and taking advantage of your life, you know so yeah it's a pain."
17467.0,Patient,"Well that's like the fires man that's what happens with these fires, and you know I ran into a guy. And he saved the couple, and this is where hundreds and hundreds, I mean four city blocks blocks gone just gone cars turned over houses nothing left complete devastation and the guy said yeah I was a 25 foot wave of playing just rolling at us and. planes coming through the vents and cars and it's so and you can't plan for that. Note with the winds that California wins coming 70 miles an hour and the flames that Paul there's nowhere, you can go."
724.0,Provider,yeah it's uh yeah hell on earth it's awful.
17467.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, well, you and I will be able to talk a lot about trauma like during our individual sessions. Because I can relate like a I did two tours in Iraq, so I can definitely relate to the trauma see I think you and I can. For sure work on some things even like cathartic Lee you know just talking about it, you know because trauma is like. The way that it impacts us like it it screws our value system up a little bit and our emotions are tied to that value system so there's a lot that we could talk about there is probably no cure for you know ptsd it's just becomes like a. Barbie routine of management of how we how we function pass that and how we manage the set those because you can't on see what you see right. I work with a guy. And he he was a medic in the navy and he didn't see anything crazy like in the war, because he was like a goal for one. It wasn't until he came hallway to volunteer and as a National Guard needed to the bridge collapses in La that he had to go and do some like real horrible things to like recover people and he's. You know what I mean like I there's nothing that I could do i'd love to beat somebody that could like. You know, turn that switch off for so he doesn't have to relive those images like anymore, but I don't know I don't know if you can. Like I can't I can't turn mine off, you know I wish somebody could turn it off and I don't think I don't think I can, I think it just turns into like a. Like a position to where like, how do you how do you heal that system that value system and get on with your life, you know what I mean so not that avoiding it is like the best thing but that's like something that a lot of us do. You know, and as it comes up it's like i'm just not gonna deal with that so. Having a like a safe place to kind of talk, but talk about it a little bit does help he and I talked about this stuff and like we have like really good conversations. I hope that it helps because it helps me, you know so like selfishly i'm like i'm hoping that that that he gets the same thing out of the conversations that I do because it just provides him with a. Like a safe place to talk about it and not be judged and not having to like oh my God that's so terrible I can't believe, like it's just like. It would you like a lot of like head nodding or just like yo this is good good little exposure things I think that's kind of like the best way to do at this point. yeah let's take a million things let's take a whole bunch of medication and suppress any kind of any kind of feelings like I don't know if that's, the best thing for either so."
17467.0,Patient,let's just numb it being medication and. You know.
724.0,Provider,"Round all the edges of life, and therefore the feelings, you know what I mean, so I don't think that's like the best thing in the world, it definitely has a place but it's not the end all be all solution so, but you and I could talk a lot about that stuff so."
17467.0,Patient,"yeah they did try to put me in the hospital and I forget the name of it, I got it my bedroom land here abilify or something like that it's like a bipolar schizophrenia something medication and and. Say not to what are they called or the nurse practitioner vertigo he put me on some medication and hitting you know me they barely talk to me and and Rama taken it. You know I don't think I mean that's something for a doctor to diagnose, not a pn."
724.0,Provider,Know actually nurse practitioners are probably better.
17467.0,Patient,than T.
724.0,Provider,"You know there's practitioners are legit like like I said think the same way, until like working in the hospital, I felt that nurse practitioners are probably more educated. In the real world, as far as patient care goes, then that most doctors or unless you're like an er doctor obviously there's like you know there's always going to be levels, but a lot of like this. Soil practitioners that I mean. that's like a anywhere from like an. Eight to 10 year education system. You know that that's masters level education. At a medical like level so like like you get an associate's degree in nursing and you make a shitload of money it's like oh that's a two year degree, but it's like they go through like their two year degree is like. A lot of hands on clinical you work in a hospital you do this, you do that and it's like when you get your bachelor's degree of me it's like you really know your shit at what a bachelor's degree in there it's like. And then the nurse practitioner is like next level stuff you know what I mean like they make like."
17467.0,Patient,When they're basically a doctor.
724.0,Provider,Almost.
17467.0,Patient,If without the licensing.
724.0,Provider,Yet in my state if they take one more year above the nurse practitioner course they becoming a doctor of nursing.
17467.0,Patient,Oh well. You don't even know that existed.
724.0,Provider,"yeah you know what I mean so it's just like they are like very legit like you will find the nurse practitioners and like chantelle very. chantelle knows her shit she's been doing this for like a long, long time you know what I mean so. it's better than having like a doctor would just casually sees patients with like hey they come in oh yeah i'm anxious like right here, take this where she's physically like at some point in her early. nursing career actually dealt with people that were very anxious, it seemed like all this stuff like it real time like play our doctors like. Like they would come in by unit see people go like but dad is like hey just give this medication just medicate him sit him down. Later, you know it'd be like nurses had a de escalate they saw the warning signs, they could tell the symptoms like before it happened, like they are very, very educated like. I tend to trust nurse practitioners will that I chose doctors, because they lived like the real world they're like us, except for me educated."
17467.0,Patient,I think what you're saying yeah because most doctors wanting to spend 15 minutes with you.
724.0,Provider,"I you know i'd be like like their top is super valuable. Right, but I feel like nurse practitioners are like the blue collar of like the medical field."
17467.0,Patient,"You know, it makes sense to me. something good label for."
724.0,Provider,"I trusted like an. All in because I work with like a bunch of them are like alright cool you really know your shit i'm like that's that's awesome especially psych psych NPs like that's their thing like like that's their thing, so they work in that field."
17467.0,Patient,"And they really understand so it's good anyway yeah I didn't even get to talk to this. Guy who's driving that and i'm like nah i'm I haven't been diagnosed with that. You know and i've heard you know some of the. Side effects and different things like that, and so. Until I thought, maybe i'll talk to chantelle about it and we couldn't figure out of that's what I need or just continue on with what i'm taking so the nurse practitioners, that I was working with. You know they worked under an umbrella of the rehabilitation Center I was going to and the rehabilitation Center went out of business, so the. doctor's office they didn't have a doctor on site that just the nurse practitioners they work under a doctor's umbrella or license and then the umbrella of the rehabilitation Center and they all disappeared. So I was taken to the trauma not anymore, because they're gone I have naproxen I haven't started taking it yet. So I just got that prescribed me so."
724.0,Provider,All right. yeah. yeah we'll get you squared away with chantel for sure.
17467.0,Patient,yeah all right.
724.0,Provider,"Oh. So that's pretty much it that's pretty much the deal we've gone over that stuff we did education with did employment history. Okay, all right so yeah, this is a good launching point I kind of have a general idea what you and I are going to probably focus in on you know initially would probably be like getting the. The medication management component addressed and more consistent in that you would all start processing the other like things kind of get to the root of why you're drinking and then kind of develop strategies. To deal with it, that doesn't involve drinking and i'd be like coping skills and. yeah like triggers and stuff like that yeah and the hard part about you know developing coping skills it's not something I could just tell you like yeah this is this is how you should go up it's like. You have to experience that thing first and then. You have to let me know what your traditional responses to that thing and then we go from there because we're gonna have to start being like well obviously that's not working, so why don't we try this. And then you will report back sometime later it's like I tried that didn't work it's like okay. So let's try this and then we'll just keep trying things until we figure out what works for you what speaks to like your needs. And then we go from there, and then we just keep building out that and the only way to get good at anything in life, as you probably know, is through repetition so. You got to start someplace you know change is difficult, we resist change we don't like it, but it has to happen in order to make real progress. And yeah no being like. You know relapse is part of you know, the recovery process I don't expect you know complete abstinence from somebody. You know until they really get like to where they need to be that takes a while you know what I mean alcohol is one of those drugs are chemicals it's difficult to manage because it's socially acceptable and. super accessible so it's it's not like you have to talk you're dealing with like a heroin dependency for yourself where it's like you have to seek that stuff out and find. The various channels it's not like you're going to see heroin commercials will you watch football games it's not like that you know I mean so. yeah alcohol is a very difficult thing because you can be triggered even when things are going good you like hell yeah you watch a baseball game you're like. yeah you know what I didn't even think about drinking, for the past three weeks about sponsored by Budweiser like oh great you know I mean so. Some of that stuff is a little difficult to navigate but it's not impossible, you know it's a matter of. You can you can like your repetitions and so that's something that for sure we can work on and we'll spend like a little bit of just getting your story getting like your triggers down and then going from there okay."
17467.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"So that'll be a game plan for us. Okay i'm gonna make an appointment for you to see me, for you know. And this program and we'll go over a little bit more what the expectations are for like compliance and stuff like that. During the next session I don't like to inundate people with too much information just know that you got to show up for your appointments in the beginning, like the first 30 days. just get to your appointments will worry about doing surveys and you know your your analysis screens and all that kind of stuff. down the road but testament done is critical, so you already got that done going through your like your group appointment your groups are on Tuesdays at 4pm i'm in I agree Shan tells them that group so you'll see me again in the group. it's a really good group that people in there are not. Disasters you know what I mean like they all got their things going on, but they are very communal like they've been in the same group with each other for a while, so it's very unified in there, I like that group so it's not like you're walking into like a landslide with. You know where it's like a substitute teacher walking into a school high school kids it's not like that that's a good group so. we'll do that and then we'll talk about doing the surveys, you know those are mandated through the state in the feds so we'll talk more about that here in a couple weeks so. Okay, did you go to like a lab did you pee in a cup initially did you do blood work or anything like that okay."
17467.0,Patient,"not yet no. I did well for this group, no."
724.0,Provider,"No, no, I mean for since you answered here have you done, like any medical lab work."
17467.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no, no, not yet they told me yeah by next week, I have to have it done."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, did they tell you where to go or how to accomplish it or."
17467.0,Patient,"that's what I have to figure out like I don't know how because I have lab work I got to do for my primary I don't know how to do it. For you guys and that's what I was going to make a phone call to them to figure out who to go to what do I say. Okay, because I don't have a paperwork like a doctor would give you."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so what they'll do is they'll figure out what the closest lab like a quest diagnostics, is to you."
17467.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and then they'll just contact them with the order and they'll just go and be like hey i'm why it. And they're like oh cool here, this is what this is what bright heart wants you to do xyz you do that and they'll they'll upload all the data results back to bright heart so you'll call the the initial compliance line like that that number that you call the start right. Okay, you have to just be like hey I need to go do my lab work on a new patient it's part of my intake this is where I live. How I go about getting that dod and then let them work through the steps to get it squared away for you all right. Okay, and then your follow up with me is going to be what what's your work schedule like. um."
17467.0,Patient,what's your seven or 8pm Pacific standard time.
724.0,Provider,Okay.
17467.0,Patient,So Monday to Friday.
724.0,Provider,"So we can't meet on a Tuesday, because that would be double dipping so."
17467.0,Patient,"And I usually have my kids on Tuesdays Thursdays, when I get I don't have custody or I don't have visitation rights right now for my children are due to a argument ahead of my essence, not because I was drinking, but that is causing some of my stress now. So she's kept them from me pretty much all year okay so, but when I get reinstated, it was supposed to be temporary and she's yeah she's playing the system so. anyway."
724.0,Provider,Richard get your kids off Thursday.
17467.0,Patient,"Tuesday Thursdays is normally like get them from five to 9pm. When we get it reinstated that's kind of how it may be, it could change, though, you know because they're doing this and that she got them and all sorts of stuff to where she keeps them from me so that's what i'm finding out to."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, could you do like 715 at night. Well, with me like like a Monday."
17467.0,Patient,um.
724.0,Provider,"You said Tuesday Tuesdays and Thursdays, when you have your kids right."
17467.0,Patient,"yeah I was trying to think I have the alumni group from my old places 530 to seven, so I guess I could do 715 years I did like to do the at the International a the. one a day I think it's called again. that's seven to eight, but I could skip one night for it."
724.0,Provider,"All right, yeah cuz i'm like i'm I only work, four days a week, and I do like 10 hour shifts but."
17467.0,Patient,check okay.
724.0,Provider,"um so yeah we'll. Do like. we'd be like. That night, as you want."
17467.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,So the December 20 at 715.
17467.0,Patient,"Before. If I just went into a quest, can I just say right hard or something like that or."
724.0,Provider,"Not because they won't have like like a work order, theoretically, you know what I mean."
17467.0,Patient,"Why don't they tell you that when they're given me all the information I wrote down they didn't even say that they just studying do initial initial lab analysis. So anyway, I know that's mature."
724.0,Provider,"yeah technically. Right so. So yeah. yep so i'll see you this coming Tuesday the 14th for group that's at 4pm. And you got your therapy with me on the 20th and I group on the 21st and then chantelle on the 22nd okay and shanteau will be the group on Tuesday, so if you have like any like. You know, somewhat simple questions or lesson before his questions she could help you out with that too so."
17467.0,Patient,"Let me ask you a question right now i'm trying to do to. Get that I lack of support group right, where I live at home, I have no family no friends we've been encoded none of my co workers will ever come visit me or ask me go do anything my family was pretty much. My my kids my wife last five with my support group arm i'm trying to temporarily work with my at my parents house. But my company one for the ladder from a doctor says stating, you know that I cannot do certain function. Which is just basically being in the field, my supervisor said oh yeah you can just work from wherever you want, and then he sent me to another group saying. Well, we just want to letter stating that you're not going to fail you're going to do your normal responsibilities, except there's no fielding for temporary basis, so I just want to let her, I was gonna i'm seeing my primary physician next on the 15th. yeah I was gonna try to write a letter and hit him up and see if he'll do it for me, but then I don't know what to do after that, because they won't I have no support group at all. So our support support groups will be a or you know my."
724.0,Provider,Any kind of like any kind of support network you like it's not exist and.
17467.0,Patient,I don't have one.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right yeah as far as the doctor recommendation that's probably going to come from your primary care so ask them. To do that it's essentially a workers note right. yeah so you're gonna want to do that with them. I mean we could try to find army have you booked for like a groups in your local area or."
17467.0,Patient,"No, I just all I was doing everything online. Virtual virtual yeah I was attending a couple different ones, and so, and then that's all dependent if I start drinking I don't and then that's The other thing I cold Turkey my meds which really probably books me up even more. weird yeah so yeah the psych meds and every other medication, I take so you know."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you should probably take your meds as prescribed to you because they have what they call a rebound effects, especially with the excuse me like ssri is if you're on any kind of serotonin or selective serotonin we have taken a better. They have what they call like rebounding effects like think of like an elastic you know what I mean it's stretched out and it goes one way and it's got to come back you know what I mean so it's not good to alter your chemistry. abruptly. Right so just as long as it takes for some that stuff to like build up in your body and takes a while the same can be said for when it comes off of it, so there are like withdrawal effects that happen when you come off medication like that. take them as prescribed. And then, if you had like questions, who was ever prescribing them to you like contact them unless it's like part of like that MP program that those people aren't around anymore. Then I would talk to your primary care for like hey, this is what i'm on i'm on X, Y and Z i'm thinking about coming off of me, what do you think and then let them let the professional tell you what what your tracks should be and how to navigate that field all right."
17467.0,Patient,yeah right.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, as far as establishing a support network with you. I mean you're going to get communal support from the group that you're in. yeah yeah that'll help, but as far as like like family and friends that works, you seem like you're kind of far removed from civil like civilization, is that the deal."
17467.0,Patient,I am so the next closest pounds 25 minutes away. My kids are my way otherwise it's the farming community and they speak Spanish.
724.0,Provider,"yep. So maybe one of the goal should be like an x. So take pick a time pick a duration to actually move and get out of that local area, you know what's things kind of stabilized for you."
17467.0,Patient,yeah. reince over here are even thing.
724.0,Provider,"Here London code. someplace. To rent the. top of that, like that's that's definitely a barrier."
