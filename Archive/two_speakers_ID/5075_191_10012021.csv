191.0,Provider,"that's good now. One thing that we always revisit is your physical health. You have some abnormal labs and. Things address, for your stomach."
5075.0,Patient,"Did you guys go, yes, I did go in the white blood cell count was back down normal so he was okay with that he said they try to do too much smoking. And everything else, and she didn't put me back on my stomach meds so you know that's good and then I also see my psychiatrist I see him every three months, so he still has me on my bed fema and my room RON for depression and to help sleep."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so remember ah for."
5075.0,Patient,it's 45 milligrams at that time.
191.0,Provider,Okay i'm gonna pull up your Majlis.
5075.0,Patient,OK.
191.0,Provider,"OK, let me, you have to pull this thing of often because if you don't use it, it feels like five or 10 Minutes it shuts off."
5075.0,Patient,"Well, my son he. knows that."
191.0,Provider,he's.
5075.0,Patient,got a password on the phone and i'm like I can't get into your password.
191.0,Provider,"Right, so you got to keep it on the fly."
5075.0,Patient,So that they don't go back to. The long after.
191.0,Provider,I know what you're talking about so i've got here the sandbox on your room raw and you're fed Sema. Any other medicines.
5075.0,Patient,"um no that's I mean I I take my own i'm not supposed to take a lot of money, I don't, but I have appropriate. I gave three of them in the morning, you know that can really irritate your stomach heavy to take tylenol. yeah I can I can do either or yeah."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so with you have and I recall, you have more acid reflux."
5075.0,Patient,I do yeah.
191.0,Provider,"I want you to look at talent and let your doctor know tylenol is not as hard on the stomach but you want to use list and 3000 milligrams a day, so if they're 500 milligrams you want to use fewer than six don't go over. Your doctorate buys you but talk with your doctor about the tylenol versus ibuprofen you'll probably have less problems with just stomach okay."
5075.0,Patient,"Okay okay sounds good Okay, I was trying to think of anything else, my medicine, sometimes I feel like. Not all the time, but sometimes like it's not working as good, I guess, maybe that comes with the territory because i've been on it for a while now. And it's not all the time I just kind of wake up, sometimes at night and then. there's I don't know I just don't I feel kind of sick, you know, like."
191.0,Provider,"Wake up not feeling feeling a little sick. yeah yeah and we have you on 20 milligrams, and so the 20 milligrams is definitely believed to cover all those receptors. yeah now, one thing I often make sure what patients arm, you know, do you feel like if you took arm like are you taking the one film in the morning and 1.5 film at night when I."
5075.0,Patient,"When I started doing that I started trying to take the half during the day in the morning. And then, trying to do that other at night, then I kind of switched it to hop in the morning half in the late afternoon and then half at that time, and you know what I mean or however you're supposed to take up but anyways I tried to split it up. When you're kind of waking up. You know not feeling very good right."
191.0,Provider,"If you lesson at nighttime dose you'll feel it so what I was thinking, if you. Do a. One film in the morning and then you want to go as close to 12 hours or longer before you take the film and a half."
5075.0,Patient,"yeah because it's one film under the Tongue, and then we are morning and one and a half at night in the evening, so I was just trying to split it up, you know what i'm saying."
191.0,Provider,"Right. So go take. Okay, so take that the last 1.5 film as late as you can like right before you go to bed okay. yeah close to the 12 hours because the medicine, the half life is at least 36 hours so to. give you. Over ideally net net some people can and everybody's body is different."
5075.0,Patient,"than being on medicine, it does could be i'm 59 years old, you know what i'm saying."
191.0,Provider,"yeah I hear what you're saying The other thing too is thinking about how you're taking it to you know, under the tongue and i've had patients Ashley say is really good after you take your medicine and wait 20 to 30 minutes before you eat or drink don't."
5075.0,Patient,"have money yeah my other doctor was a dead ringer on you didn't eat talk smoke nothing 30 minutes after you took it for 30 yeah. he'd be your head, you know and that could be. What like some days when i'm just in a hurry, you know what I mean and not thinking and take it, and then not you know think. about an."
191.0,Provider,"hour and you want to do that same thing, but. Thank you take it to."
5075.0,Patient,right here.
191.0,Provider,And i've actually interestingly i've known patience to wait a little longer before they eat or drink and they felt like. It worked better for them so definitely try to at least 30 minutes.
5075.0,Patient,"Okay i'm starting going. To be more focused about that, because when I was telling him, it was definitely you know you really had to be focused on how you're taking your medicine so i'll go back to being more excuse me about that."
