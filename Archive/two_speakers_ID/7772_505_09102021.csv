Shortly after Christmas, oh no this was around thanksgiving that's right because I got my sense of taste and smell back on thanksgiving evening when we were eating dinner. And I that's the only symptom I had was I just completely lost my taste and smell, I was like down for a day, but we were working at a new construction site and there was nobody there, so I was able, still to work by myself. And stuff like that, so I thought we were going to cruise right through it and. For Labor day weekend because we camp, I have four kids and we were going to plan on going campaign, and then the one was sick and had a fever we're like well that's no fun so we'll stay home.

7772.0,Patient,"The well, that was the second part of our little thing here tonight, so i've been kind of been battling insomnia, for about two and a half weeks. And the whole thing that kind of got me in this mess was a work injury about five years ago and that's how I got hooked on prescription drugs was from the doctor so then when they stopped me that's what started this whole thing. But the only thing I did physical therapy for about six eight months. Not too long ago over the winter months and that kind of is what fixed everything, so I don't know but they usually prescribed me flexor all and that seemed to be the only thing to help me with sleep, and I know that's not habit forming or a non a car."
505.0,Provider,"Oh yeah. i'm so i'm a psych nurse practitioner, so I can't prescribe those kind of physical medicine. mom met you know I can't prescribe that way won't be paid for what. I can offer for insomnia him, it is President and if you've ever tried that that's a non addictive in medication that's helpful asleep. So that's an option, but it sounds like your sleep is related to pain Is that correct."
7772.0,Patient,"Just muscle mainly muscle issues with my back so we. kind of done that it's just the one doctor I usually see here she dropped our insurance, so the next one, we got because I was kind of looking in the first scene future they're booked out until like the end of next month, was the soon as they can see it."

And you might need to be alert in a way it can the middle of the night for the kids so right, you know you might not want to try it right now. Okay, just."
7772.0,Patient,"When I first when I first used to take flexor I didn't like it, because it made me groggy in the morning that I found out, I was taking it right. I wasn't taking the right dosage it was I was what they told me, I was taking too little and take the right dosage and it would work and then it was like it worked so. But yeah they have a small milligram and trouser down that that would be the way."
505.0,Provider,"yeah but, again, you don't have to take kid every day for it to be effective, so you work with what works for you and works for your family right now to split it in half, we want to be able to get up if you're you need to."
