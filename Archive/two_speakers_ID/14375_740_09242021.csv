You know that's when I went on, you that's when I own overdose so fed up with it, you know they're arguing about a hose and the neighbors think that she's older hose I get involved in that no. person can only take so much."
740.0,Provider,So what I your stressors all your triggers that. cause you to relax.
14375.0,Patient,"Being like in this environment, right here, where I live, every day. I mean every day I wake up as a new problem some regarding for neighbors. My life no it's just the littlest things a little space thing explodes."

Night not like you know that's my girl has a real bad thing that takes a lot of coffee, you know, like just talking personally take so much that. You know they truly I mean i'm being truthful it's hard work for somebody to help out somebody like that, and my parents don't help, not at all. Not just me this up, I really go out and I get destructive I started drinking vodka i'm getting a spice I you know and."
740.0,Provider,"i'll do automatically make. You angry as a trigger for you. Yes, that's what it is, if not, if not the people. But is this the anchor so anybody who makes you."
14375.0,Patient,know anybody who feeds I love. The you want to go and you.
740.0,Provider,want to do something disruptive. That makes sense. So. let's let's look at it real fast because.
14375.0,Patient,"they're basically. threatened to kick her out there, basically spreading to kick her out, and you know because of me. that's."
740.0,Provider,Where can you say with.
14375.0,Patient,"I don't know right now i'm working on with my girlfriend special extra hunters every other day soon thanks breaking up when you're breaking up with her, but she's out of state and. I mean. i'm looking at right now. Yes, yes. be nice Nice. I can talk, I can talk over there."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
14375.0,Patient,doesn't submitting is ah all day long let's move on on some very seriously.
740.0,Provider,So I don't even have to control that angle. You gotta really. really sure if you.
14375.0,Patient,Any can go in.
740.0,Provider,"Any time that, so what that is is it is build a frustration for their mean this stuff has been building for a long time that you never got resolved and then now you have a short. fuse you have zero tolerance zero patience and in a moment, if somebody does something that you don't like or that you think is not acceptable, then you go lift. That but but I need you to stop."
14375.0,Patient,Going oh.
740.0,Provider,We don't have to go right.
14375.0,Patient,"Yes, that's my only thing. I spoke of your marijuana that calms me down."
740.0,Provider,"there's no. We gotta do we gotta do without assessment, because the thing about it is, is there, like you said at one point you couldn't find them were wanna. So when you can find them were one of the way you got to some dope so we're not using substances to calm us down we're going to use custom fields you're going to use your own inner strength that exists de de de de down. And on the inside of you, and then we're going to be we're going to learn how to cope. And so that's that's how we do that we're not going to cope with substances we're not going to use cigarettes because we're not going to use marijuana to cope, we never used. To cope we're gonna get we're going to learn how to use actual coping skills to help us cope and be aware of our triggers. Okay."
14375.0,Patient,yeah it's easier said than done on me I.
740.0,Provider,"I know that he just has been done, which is why i'm not i'm not saying there's going to be a miracle. is going to happen overnight, but what I am saying is that if, if you do choose to smoke visual view but, at the end of the day, i'm telling you, is it is not. is not sufficient enough to be able to help you, with your anger, because, of course, like you said you've had history in times past. Where you've actually used stuff will you try to five sentences to be able to cope with your angels, and you couldn't find it so you end up doing something worse and you end up overdose. versa. The first way to cope with your anger in that you have to be aware of what triggers you. that's the first."
14375.0,Patient,thing.
740.0,Provider,"I said, the first thing the first way to cope with your anger is that you have to be aware of what triggers you. Okay that's, the first thing awareness is key if it's angry triggers are the things that fit you all."
14375.0,Patient,So.
740.0,Provider,"yeah anger triggers all the things they say to all so knowing your triggers and being cautious around them. will reduce the likelihood of your anger get out of control, if we don't get the nothing else in this in on this on this paper I want I want us to focus on this for a moment, so first off in order to reduce it, you have to be aware of it. And not only that not only you have to be aware of it, but then you also have to be cautious around it. So if you know that you that if you know that your environment is not conducive and not a healthy environment, it is not conducive to recovery, then let me some way somehow we will have to change your environment or. If you're not able to change your environment at this moment, that means you're going to have to be cautious. Which means that if you already know this enables neighbors around your grandma's site get on your nerves. If you know that they that they cause you to go out, then that means nine times out of 10 when you see the neighbors coming maybe you should walk away or maybe you shouldn't get involved at all."
14375.0,Patient,doesn't do. But it's hard because i'm not even really like I said i'm not even allowed to be so. Exactly so.
740.0,Provider,"So that's, the first thing if they get on your nerves. Then, maybe they see and I understand like even now you distracted because you got plans going on in the background, so this tells you not to be able to. focus and it's understandable, but this is what has to happen first in. order to be able to cope. You have to be aware of your triggers, so this is what you're going to do. The show homework, with the waves are you listening to me, I need you listen to me. or I."
14375.0,Patient,I got a pen and paper right now. alright. So this I know.
740.0,Provider,You.
14375.0,Patient,guys all day long that's awesome.
740.0,Provider,"Well, you know she and she's an older lady so that's what happens things happen and how about. You, but you don't have to be okay, with it, so this what I need you to do I need you to create a. list of your triggers. create a list a list of everything everybody every person every animal whatever you. create a list."
14375.0,Patient,of your be a long list.
740.0,Provider,"That five create a list of. All of them. I want to know all of them Okay, and so the first thing it says is to create a list of history and review them every day. Every day. I set."
14375.0,Patient,up a little bit review them and.
740.0,Provider,review them every day. Can you hear me.
14375.0,Patient,uh huh yes.
740.0,Provider,"It says reviewing your triggers would keep them fresh in your mind So if you review your triggers a would allow them to keep to stay fresh in your mind. Okay, increasing the likelihood that you'll notice them before they become a problem that's the whole point of US trading triggers."
14375.0,Patient,"Back then, I want you to be able to notice them."
740.0,Provider,"before they become a problem. So if you are writing your triggers down and you're reviewing them every day, that means that that means that it increases the likelihood that you're going to notice them. Okay, so one of the neighbors come around and you like you know what that person on my list they make me angry, let me do something else."
14375.0,Patient,Yes.
740.0,Provider,"Let let me do something else, or if a family member comes in, or or even your girlfriend because your girlfriend through my shoe a shoe good food, so if you dare scrambling up the phone or whatever like that, and you know she's a trigger maybe I Maybe I should answer the phone today. As soon as a. Young fan so that's what I meant that's that's, the first thing I want you to do in regards."
14375.0,Patient,"To the broker my chrome before I broke it on purpose, because every time it seems like maybe. I believe it's not broken the. prayers for guys, why did you break your phone like that."
740.0,Provider,"Sometimes, and the same and the thing about it is when I meet with some I appreciate that you are willing to come to get treatment, I think that is a that is a major thing that is a major step in your life is to be able to say look I need help, because I can keep doing these. I don't you know I want to be better and so that's so that's what we're going to try to gather we're going to try to work on you being better So these are my this my last question before we end our session. amy. amy I know that the overdoses we're mistake. Have you ever had any returns as well you've had any suicidal ideation homicidal ideation of Al Qaeda in the pain."
14375.0,Patient,"I did, yes, I did it on purpose of insert. Like about 2011 is attached to the baseball BAT incident. And I was trying to get into a. doctor's doctors psychiatric know outpatient and nate nate I wasn't I wasn't I didn't meet the criteria criteria, so I went on, I took about 3030 pills, and thanks to both the box I purposely on like. Okay, or not."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
14375.0,Patient,"and send them there, except except."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so since that since 2013 or 20 living Have you had any other utterances recent occurrences, where you have one into that one is to kill yourself had any plan or any intention of kitty is there a one than that. No okay."
14375.0,Patient,"No, no."
740.0,Provider,I didn't want to make sure. Okay well we're gonna keep work on additional homework is.
14375.0,Patient,The way I look at people with.

We were they take it a step on much during a almost fall down, sometimes with strong performance or anything like that."
740.0,Provider,"Fo I mean it just because the records behavior because that's how you that's how you. Basically portray your anger. So I mean yeah we're going to work on it that's your first assignment, so the next time I see you we're going to discuss these traders. So."
14375.0,Patient,down.
740.0,Provider,"review them every day, up until you see me again. Okay, and the purpose again of reviewing them. It is so you can increase the likelihood that you notice them before they become a problem so we're just not writing them down, just so that we can no no we're writing them down so that we can be aware of them, so that we can make plans will have to avoid them does that make sense."
