17043.0,Patient,Oh. Oh OK.
105.0,Provider,"OK so. Next to your notes, where you see 415 number, I want you to put s m S, which means it's a text message option for you. Okay okay so make sure you really write a good note, this is a cell phone like make sure you really write that down that this is a cell number, where you can only message via texting. OK. Now what you can do. is why don't you do this will do an experiment today i'm going to do something kind of unique i'm going to ask you to actually i'm going to ask you, though, you can I don't know whether you have enough. ability to do two things at once, but you may want to leave the video go back in and text that number your name. date of birth checking in with gwen of year. For what are we at right now 9am today. And so we'll do an experiment, to see how long it takes them to check you in. Via SMS so i'm going to stay here but you're going to you're going to either leave the video come back, but you're going to text your name, date of birth, that you're checking in for 9am individual therapy, please check me in and you're going to text that to that number."

That message that message goes to bright heart health, I will not see it. Okay Okay, so what that is what you just did was s and S check in. Okay, what you are asked to do before today was to do a check in through virtual clinic my concern is, you may not have good notes on that let's look at that notepad again. see if you can find the words virtual clinic anywhere on your notes and if see if there's a number associated with it. Now. Why can get to there if you don't see anything, so this is going to be. Like bold. Like unwind and really clear. Like you need it to pop out at you."
17043.0,Patient,This is this the number 88847141175.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, so next to that. Put virtual clinic and then in parentheses put V see because, if I ever remind you, it will be V see, I will say, have you checked in with the sea and then you'll know what that is. Okay, because i'm lazy and I don't want to a virtual clinic. yeah Okay, and then on that page do you also have my number, which is where you are now do you have that 765 number next to. My name."
17043.0,Patient,yeah i'm writing it down right now work put it all together.
105.0,Provider,"Oh good so what's really important is that you put the word zoom next to it, so that you know that it's not a telephone number. yeah so it's gwen zoom ID is what it is so capital I capital D and that number when you're ready you just let me know."
17043.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Is 76538306132. Okay, and I think, just so it's all in one place do the same thing, but put Dr Arielle you Dr real yeah i'm pretty sure that students so Dr rob real zoom ID and then the word group. Or, however, you want to organize that so it's."
17043.0,Patient,965306868.
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
17043.0,Patient,And then 35323532 okay.
105.0,Provider,"So if, for example, you're not getting links, because I don't send links, so this way you can actually just type it in at the top, where it asks for the ID just type it in okay."
17043.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Excellent so for individual therapy with me gotta check in, and you can either do it through virtual clinic that's the 884 virtual clinic or you can try as you did today through SMS but I will say you wanted to SMS The night before."
17043.0,Patient,Oh okay.
105.0,Provider,"or six in the morning. Many hours many hours in advance, because we don't know how long it will take, and you know that i'm going to end up saying, have you checked in so in order to make sure the check in is done, we wanted to lots of hours in advance so it's done. Okay, so experiment with it, but again, you don't need to do check in for group only when you meet with me. Okay alright So here we go let's get this device set down somewhere, so your little pause free. You won't need to take notes today, because today is therapy and it's not about writing notes it's about more experiential exercises, but I want to find out how you've been doing this how you doing."
17043.0,Patient,"i've been doing all right, except for a few days ago I just got back from my trip, I went to Dallas with my brother to see my daughter. And I start getting sick yesterday. i'm like about losing my voice."
105.0,Provider,Okay. What other questions do you have.
17043.0,Patient,To have a headache. sore throat. pretty much it right now I just been taking tylenol to.
105.0,Provider,Do you know if you have a fever.
17043.0,Patient,"No, I don't think i'm running fever I don't think i'm."
105.0,Provider,You tempted to want to get a toba test.
17043.0,Patient,"If I do go get it. tested i'll have to be over here at our this place the Center that they call up. um. I can't even think of the name of it, but there we got so many cases right now on or on the reservation here in Laguna so they're like really, really telling everybody to more or less stay home and not go out, you know. yeah yeah cuz I think they said, like at at some positive tests. yeah and they send us some text messages you know, to let us be aware of what's going on here on the reservation. So they sent me a text this morning and innate that if I wanted to go get tested. I can go over to that place and get tested."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, well, you sounds like you know where to go if you decide to go do that."
17043.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"All right, um i'd like to do today is just want to review a little bit and ask you have you had a chance to practice because you remembered the belly breathing."
17043.0,Patient,"Have you had a chance to practice I didn't even get it to do that I, I was trying to do that, last night and that's when I noticed my body was like not feeling good. I was like oh man, I was like gum because I I I just like forgot all about it, I was like oh my assignment i'm nice like. do that and but then I can't believe breathe good because of my throat, the way it is right now. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"So it'll continue to be something to. To work on you found it difficult to actually get the air into the lower part of the long and we were just going to work on an exercises where you did that. So that will continue to be something to explore, you can do it anywhere laying down standing in line somewhere where you can just sort of feel on the inhale the stomach comes out on the inhale. that's the trends just want to take that one piece and get you familiar with it, so that you're comfortable doing it."
17043.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"What i'd like to do do is is work on what I would call imagery. will give me a sense of. You know how comfortable, you are with it, and at the same time i'll be able to have in an ongoing note that stays there throughout the work i'll be able to have these particular images and if I ever need to reference back to them for you i'll have them right there. Because, in some ways, they are resources for people so, for example, you know, I was talking about using your breathing to regulate negative emotions, we can also use imagery. So I thought I would spend a little bit of time with you doing that would that be okay."
17043.0,Patient,yeah that's fine okay.
105.0,Provider,"Good well we'll start with there's a few of them 123456 there are six that go by fast and the last one can sometimes take several sessions so we're not going to do that one today, probably. But but we'll do these really sort of short quick ones, so the first three fall into this category of what I call your resource team. So the resource team is made up of three images or figures and it's going to ask of you to think of creative imagery. it's not in fact it lives in the right brain that sort of mystical or creative, so allowing you know, the possibility of whatever comes to your mind first. You know, let that be okay that that's what comes to your mind, and so one of the figures that i'm going to ask you to think of is I want you to think of some figure that is either real like you've seen it. or it's imagined. Maybe it's through. Some fantasy you've had or maybe it was in a TV show in a book in a movie I want you to think of a protective figure that 100% embodies the image of a protective figure what is that for you."
17043.0,Patient,Think right now i'm.
105.0,Provider,scan books you scan in your memory books you've read and see what images of a singular character that was protective.
17043.0,Patient,Oh there's like qb programs I watch on TV.
105.0,Provider,Tell me.
17043.0,Patient,Chicago MED.
105.0,Provider,who's protective in that.
17043.0,Patient,i'm the. Fire department people.
105.0,Provider,So that is that the firefighters.
17043.0,Patient,yeah there any firefighters okay.
105.0,Provider,"perfect. And then the next one. Is a figure either real or imagined, just like you did just now. That embodies the image of nurturing so this kind of character, this kind of figure What it does is it season you your full potential and it's like wants for you to reach it and will nurture that aspect in you, it sees all of what you are capable of, and it only drives to nurture you. What is that figure."
17043.0,Patient,"When I explain, like my motion. or I can't. it's almost like my. How would I explain that."
105.0,Provider,"tell me what you see in your mind's eye, what does it look like."
17043.0,Patient,"Like my strife and. What I have. going for myself, but guess what i'm how I push myself i'm. capabilities, I have. To push myself to doing some um."
105.0,Provider,"If you could, if you had if you were to draw that what would you see on the page."
17043.0,Patient,And I would be hard to draw. um.
105.0,Provider,"Well we're working with imagery so we're going to want to draw on that, where I want to pull from so take what you were just talking about which isn't quite visual it's bit experiential and see if you can find a character in a book. In a movie in a TV show that embodies it this thing you just described."
17043.0,Patient,"One of the things the things I do is I. I do wildland firefighting. And that's like being out in the. Wilderness the. Timber the woods. been on fire so. I mean like just being out there is like when i'm out there i'm just that, like peace."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let me see if I heard that correctly when you are in. Are you saying in a wooded area around trees."
17043.0,Patient,"yeah like the wilderness, like the forest."
105.0,Provider,"uh huh there we go. Okay, so really check in with yourself let's make sure that that we got it wants you to bring your imagination right there into seeing the trees around to. The temperature the wind or the the quiet, or maybe their sounds and do you have this experience of feeling nurtured."
17043.0,Patient,"yeah I feel. I feel at peace, like. i'm. Like I have like no worries in the world like when i'm out there."
105.0,Provider,"Alright well we're going to go with that, for now, if it turns out, later on, we need to modify will do it then but i've got this what you just described. got written down the third one, is a wise figure, so a wise figure what i'm going to invite you to do is think of real or imagined. A figure that embodies not only stored information but it's not enough to know something no should need to be able to have the common sense to do it to live it the wisdom, so I want you to picture real or imagined a wise figure."
17043.0,Patient,"One of my. One of my. Things is. Not a clean i'm is to try to get a job that's what that's one of my. My goal right now is to. When I think about how it's going to be, you know if I do get a job down here because I just moved down here to new Mexico and. I don't know how it's going to be here."
105.0,Provider,"Okay come back come back that's a goal it actually happened. I have that written down. This is, this is something else I want you to I want you to really listen. wise picture a movie where you thought. This character is why. They have wisdom."
17043.0,Patient,is like could it be like somebody like my mom my mom's wise and. She gives me a lot of wisdom talks to me a lot I got her a lot. Of.
105.0,Provider,candy. I want to check on the one you chose you went with some someone real on this one. yeah I wanna i'm going to check in on it. Good is this is so pure meaning the firefighter is absolutely protected there's no ambivalence there's no mixed feelings. Being the wilderness is absolutely peaceful. I gotta find out has mom made some poor choices.
17043.0,Patient,"um. No. um. Well, she um she had to. Like pretty much put her life on hold and raise her grandkids that's, the only thing. i'm. Like I always talk to my mom about like things that i'm going to do and. Show is you know encourages me to. Go after what I what i'm trying to do."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. So i'm going to go ahead and use your mom. Okay. Alright, so that is you'll hear me say your resource team. imagery of firefighters imagery of being in the forest the trees and the peace that comes from that and getting wisdom. From mom so there'll be times when i'll say let's bring in that resource team and that's what I mean. moving to another image. Some people already do this naturally they do this thing called compartmentalization they might say to themselves. I don't want to think about this, I want to think about this, if I think about this negative thought it'll bring me down and I don't wanna. write."
17043.0,Patient,"That going in my mind, I mean I got a lot going on. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"You probably do it naturally most people know how to do that it's a great skill to have. And we don't want to do it all the time, because then we can out on the wisdom that comes from that history. But what i'm going to do right now is is capitalized on that skill, you have but i'm going to be a little bit more precise, this time I mean, I have a visual with it so here's the here's the instruction, I want you to think a container that is big enough. and strong enough to hold all your negative emotional stuff and want you to tell me the image of something big enough and strong enough to hold all your negative emotional stuff."
17043.0,Patient,This would have to be a woodblock.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and how about how big is it."
17043.0,Patient,I say it's like. Mid size um. I don't know see how would I. Maybe by. two feet by one something like that.
105.0,Provider,"two feet by one Okay, and how all that stuff stay inside."
17043.0,Patient,try not to think about what to not.
105.0,Provider,"Keep using your your visualization. Okay. answer that question how let's stay inside using imagination, how let's stay inside."
17043.0,Patient,don't think about it.
105.0,Provider,"No, no. Okay i'm on that come on back, I want to picture. I want you to picture the wooden box, that is to buy one I want you to picture how. Will that stuff stay in there. visually what. Will you see that keeps it in."
17043.0,Patient,not looking at it.
105.0,Provider,So is there a lid on the box.
17043.0,Patient,Oh yeah I forgot the lid.
105.0,Provider,"And now, is there a lock that keeps it in."
17043.0,Patient,A locking key to. So.
105.0,Provider,"Who, who has the key."
17043.0,Patient,I have the key I took it away.
105.0,Provider,"Keep it inside excellent. That was complete and now let's go over to. A distancing metaphor, so the one we just did was it's closed up it's compartmentalize it's in a box. lock in a key and you are the only one that has that key. we're going to go to another one which has to do it's not about locking it up it's about having it moving away so it's a distancing metaphor. i'm going to give you a bunch of examples, and you can either go with one of mine, maybe you like one or you might be inspired by your own and then you'll tell me. So a distancing metaphor might be i'm standing on the riverbank and i'm with my resource team they're all here with me. And i'm looking at a leaf the sort of like moving down the river and on it, I have grief and I can see it moving further away to the point that. I really can't see it anymore or there's a shooting star or there's a rocket airplane or there's a speedboat. or there's a balloon that has hate written on it and I watch it go up and I can't see it anymore its distance. is now so far I can't see it or i'm in a car and Angers coming at me, you know and it passes me by and then I can see in my rearview mirror that it's gotten further and further away, I continue in my direction. But I see it, and then over time I can't see it anymore, it is a distancing metaphor so i've listed a few of them see which one comes to your mind."
17043.0,Patient,Falling star.
105.0,Provider,"Falling star. So if I were to ever say let's put this thought this image this emotion on that falling star you'd be able to see it and then there'd be a point where you couldn't anymore, do I have that right. Okay, and now we're going to go to. A safe place and safe place is a place in nature, that is beautiful and it'd be nice if it was real. This one I wouldn't mind if it was real. If you have one was in nature, it was beautiful and you felt so safe there was that."
17043.0,Patient,It was just me close my eyes closing my eyes and visualize and me in a. place where you'd have to wear a. dress. And didn't have to think about anything just be at peace were a couple minutes.
105.0,Provider,"that's actually the effect and what i'm doing now is you're going to describe where in real time, in other words, in your actual history of your life, where you were somewhere in nature, and it was beautiful and you felt safe tell me where was that."
17043.0,Patient,"It was actually was here when I when I finally came when he came to be with my dad it was like. I was here, I was at peace."
105.0,Provider,"So, listen to the instructions, one more time you doing great. Have I heard in nature, somewhere, no, no okay so try try again go back in there, go, you know the felt experience but you're having a difficult time, describing where you. Learn in nature. It was. Where were you."
17043.0,Patient,"I don't know exactly where I was like explain it, it was just like. I was just. On so i'm. Standing there watching everything everything that was around me. And I wasn't thinking about anything, it was just. Looking at everything and. seeing how. Beautiful it could be. And how it was. In my mind was that piece for."
105.0,Provider,You see any landscape.
17043.0,Patient,I could see trees. I don't see what their.
105.0,Provider,trees tell me about the water.
17043.0,Patient,What the water is kind of like off walk off to it on a distant. It looks like crap.
105.0,Provider,"yeah. there's trees and is it flat or mountains, what do you see."
17043.0,Patient,"I see like mountains, but not too big, of a mountain I can. Literally hear the water how it flows down the river."
105.0,Provider,"You can hear it. Good. And as you visit that imagery including what year do you notice that it is a sense of beautiful and safe. yeah yeah okay good got it. And so, one of the reasons why i'm doing this is because. If I need to bring you there. I want to have adjectives to help. Okay, so now I know it will be mountains and trees and you're not able to say, or maybe you can do you know what city, this was or town or state or area. So, if this is enough that's fine we've got mountains trees and you can hear the water from the creek. In a distance. Excellent fantastic. let's do a little self observation just a little check in doing something different it's very different than the belly breathing that I was going over with you, what has today been like to use your creative mind what's what's it been like for you today."
17043.0,Patient,"um. It really hasn't been I mean like. i'm. i'm trying to like fight off the sickness that i'm possibly get and then. that's kind of like a little struggle, but i'm. trying not to let it affect me. yeah that's my day is just starting out so."
105.0,Provider,"So there's some distraction from the symptoms but you're doing your best to focus here and do these activities. yeah Okay, and your days just starting. yeah okay. And how comfortable, are you in your mind in. The creative half of it like that creative part, the one that uses imagination and fantasy how comfortable, are you there."
17043.0,Patient,"i'm I think i'm good i'm i'm. i'm like to where I can imagine you know. It what my life would be like this, or was like that and. um. yeah I mean this is really helping me to understand a lot, you know this therapy sessions. makes me look at things like different than what I what I did before. and not to be so, not to let myself stress out so much within you know that little short span like something happens and. it's like I start stressing, and it feels like it's the end of the world, but it's actually not and. i'm just trying to take my day. day by day, instead of. i'm not. Being so sad and all about it."
105.0,Provider,"What was the second word, he said satin. doll."
17043.0,Patient,"doll yeah you know, like i'm. To be more creative instead of i'm. Not displaying you know what I mean."
105.0,Provider,"you'll help me over time, understand that more. You have right now and, just as you were sharing something about the word stress feels like it's end of the world, it makes me think we may want to add one more goal. Because the two goals that I have right now are, I want to get a full time working job, and the second one, I want to get to where. i'm off what you said, be off."
17043.0,Patient,When you meditate.
105.0,Provider,"yeah yeah Okay, but let's talk a little bit about that word stress. And it feels like it's the end of the world, so so that's the subject and see if you can identify a goal, you have and let's see if we can add one that has to do with that what's your goal, what would you like."
17043.0,Patient,"i'd like to. Finish get my resumes out in. Get all that stuff done so, I could get put in for jobs."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm that actually has to do with full time jobs, so what i'm going to do that's an objective we're going to do that that's not a goal. that's an objective okay hang in there you're you're fine so a kind of a word game in a way, but so in order to get the full time job you just identified I need to fill out resumes is that right. yep okay okay. So let's just say every week you're going to do a certain number, you probably have an idea of how many you would like to do versus how many you're doing. So take how many you're doing. And then compare it to how many you think you might do in the next couple weeks, how many already doing."
17043.0,Patient,i'm working on working on one right now.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, an application or resume."
17043.0,Patient,An application.
105.0,Provider,"There we go okay so maybe how many a week, are you doing at this point."
17043.0,Patient,"um I was only able to go to. three different places here. and get applications from them and. They told me just to fill them out once I get them filled out, then, to bring them back to them and."
105.0,Provider,"Okay you're going to correct me now i'm going to make a statement it's random you're going to correct me. I am filling out about two applications, a week and I would like to fill out for a week now you tell me what you want."
17043.0,Patient,That i'd like to at least get. The two completed.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. And when would you say is reasonable, given the other obligations, you have to get those two applications completed reasonable amount of time."
17043.0,Patient,A day or two to get them done.
105.0,Provider,"So we'll just put January 7 okay. I didn't quite get to where I was attempting to go earlier i'm going to try again. let's just take the phenomenon, you know that word phenomenon. Okay, take the phenomenon of feels like the end of the world. That one. Where else. Do you have that experience that phenomenon. When else like what other time."
17043.0,Patient,A loss of a family member.
105.0,Provider,So in grief. Any other time.
17043.0,Patient,"No, I don't think, so I think it's mostly just grief, because I had a lot of loss. The past year."
105.0,Provider,yeah and do you think that you would have. cried really sat with the loss of those people in your life have you grieved.
17043.0,Patient,"A little bit, but not totally let myself grieve."
105.0,Provider,"Do you think that you do that thing, though, you. put it in a box and. don't got it."
17043.0,Patient,"Okay, I. Have a tendency of doing that i'm good at doing that hiding my. My. grief."
105.0,Provider,Do you think it does you any harm you're hiding the grief.
17043.0,Patient,"i'm not necessarily i'm. The only thing is like. i'll have my good days and then i'll have my bad days, where. i'll. be like like my world's falling apart. And then, once I let it like I let it all out my grief out some of it out, I get okay."
105.0,Provider,"Tell me more about the word stress. goes by a lot of different main names for different people, some people identify it as. Sad or anger fear anxiety oh."
17043.0,Patient,"Good mostly larger like anxiety. and sad. A little bit of fear, but not too much."
105.0,Provider,If you can distinguish the difference between fear and anxiety.
17043.0,Patient,know I could. relate to. My fear and anxiety that anxiety.
105.0,Provider,what's the difference between the two.
17043.0,Patient,"Fear is like when my body's like body totally is like scared of something you know I don't it's. Like my hair on the back of my neck stands up that's fear. and anxiety, just like. When I get anxiety, I have a tendency to have like a pain in my stomach."
105.0,Provider,"You have body awareness you're aware that when you're in a fear response your whole body is scared and you're aware of the hair sort of standing up in the back of your neck. And you have this sense of when it's anxiety that there's pain in the stomach. If I said to you that it's the same. message from the same. Part of the brain would that surprise you, or would it kind of seemed like it made sense."
17043.0,Patient,"yeah it does make sense, so."
105.0,Provider,So. The body is in. A perceived threat of danger.
17043.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"The amygdala. alarms you lets you know danger. that's all it does, by the way it was danger. yeah no danger danger, no danger it's not a very complex part of the brain but it sure is important for our survival. yeah sometimes it over alarms. Sometimes it does fear at us and it wipes out our whole body when really all it needed was. Just a little bit. yeah hey. Sometimes will call. we'll call it anxious to recall it fear or will call it nervous will call it stress, but all of these things if we break it down if we say, well, is this land mykola. Acting Is this the one that sending the alarm that there's danger that there's a threat happening, we can probably break down a lot. of our big emotional reactions to that part of the brain. And how do we regulate it there's a few ways to do it pretty cool. One way i've already taught you. But you're working on doing it and we'll get there one way is to get the body to know there's actually no immediate danger right now there's just a perception of danger in the future. If there's no actual danger, but the body doesn't know that. yeah it's responding in it's very archaic reptilian way. As if there was a saber tooth tiger it's reacting the same way to rejection abandonment criticism lonely it, it can react, the same way, it would, as if there was a threat to life and limb. And that's way too big wouldn't you agree. So when we know that about our brain that it is useful. But not so dialed up doesn't need to be as dialed up as it is yeah so if we can know that that's a cool part of our brain, but that it's over working, then we can use skills to say well that's just my brain that's my old reptilian brain. it's overreacting there's actually no danger, and so you can use the skills that you'll learn to get the body to send the message back up to the amygdala that your body is safe. But you're going to need to remember to do it. what's your brain will naturally do is called. Confirmation bias, it will look it'll scan the environment for evidence to support it's dangerous they're going to reject me, the world is a dangerous place. But you'll have to work hard to contradict that. yeah because when you look around actually. it's not actually dangerous right now there's no one pointing a gun at you, or about to cut your head off. But the amygdala is still like yes it is yes, it is yes, it is. you'll have to work hard, where once you didn't maybe it'll work harder to do these these ways of emotionally regulating to to getting that amygdala to calm and itself. You won't just compartmentalize Mitchell they doing other things to meet. That response in new ways that reinforces. That you're okay so you'll be doing that over time. But if you just let that first message of danger danger you're going to die. The one that says to you and I happen to know what it two of them that it says to you is. The world is falling apart. And it feels like the end of the world. It sends that message, and if you keep feeding that. That. Will."
17043.0,Patient,Oh wait I gotta plug my phone and wait. Oh where'd you go.
105.0,Provider,i'm here. At the video but.
17043.0,Patient,My battery I didn't know it was going dead. Okay. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"So um you know we covered a few different things today. What. What I learned about you is that you have somatic awareness you're aware of your body's message to you, your stomach messages you when it's nervous anxious and I didn't learn were sad messages you in the body, but I did learn for anxiety it messages you in a pain in the stomach. If for those moments, instead of. blocking it. or putting something in the body if instead you listen to the message and you spoke to it. And said. What are you afraid of. what's happening right now, how can I help, and it may seem really strange to be talking to a part of your body. it's trying to communicate something to you, where you may have been ignoring it. And it might keep you sick instead ask it what's going on how am I not living my core values how am I not taking care of myself how am I not speaking my truth, these are ways to start to investigate, otherwise you know what we end up getting sick."
17043.0,Patient,hmm.
105.0,Provider,"we've got to listen, our gut communicates. it's a lot of people call it our second brain it's so quick and so good at communicating. When we're not doing something that we normally believe in strongly it'll message us it'll give us a zap of guilt actually when that's a word that we can like oh man I didn't do what I normally do or I didn't do enough of something and I have a knot in my stomach. yeah so start to be a listener, to the gut start to listen to it, instead of pretending like it's not there are looking to put some kind of medicine in it. tune in to the wisdom of that part of the body. You may not know, but in the stomach in the lining of it, there is. The production depends on which research, I read between 80 and 90% of your serotonin is produced in the stomach. which helps us feel happy. serotonin helps us feel happy. filter mean helps us feel pleasure, but we want, we want both. But we really need to have a good, healthy happy."
17043.0,Patient,gut yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Well, think of it like that, like I better understand what's going on in there. Because doesn't it happen instantaneously."
17043.0,Patient,mm hmm. And sometimes.
105.0,Provider,"It responds before you have words for it mm hmm so we might as well, listen to it because it messages us fast and first. yeah so over the next week or so start to tune into kind of picturing like it's a separate part of you, and being like. What do you worry about."
17043.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"stay in inner dialogue with it is, if you were talking to another person like this best friend is this messenger of the God. What do you want, what do you worry will happen, what is it that i'm not doing oh you're not taking care of yourself that might say, or it might say you're ignoring that we're sad and we need to cry. Well, I don't know what it's going to say to you, but just spend some time tuning in and listening to what it's trying to signal. Okay let's schedule another time to meet. i'm. All right now i'll tell you what I have, I have 7am and 10am on a Thursday January 13 and then I have 8am on January 14."
17043.0,Patient,How about January 14 at 10am.
105.0,Provider,"Oh, that one I don't have I have 13 okay. Okay 13th Okay, and when is when is your group normally. tuesday's perfect so just repeat after me January 13. At 10am."
17043.0,Patient,And then.
