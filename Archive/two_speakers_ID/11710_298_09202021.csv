298.0,Provider,"Hello there. yeah. So, have you had any negative responses to I didn't we put you on boost part, let me check."
11710.0,Patient,Oh yeah this.
298.0,Provider,"week we put you at a tiny, tiny dose."
11710.0,Patient,yeah I first kind of had loss of appetite but that's way better now the only thing that's bothering me is been waking up every night just a moment i'll just wake up and that's new usually I can stick to the night.
298.0,Provider,"So I don't know that is clear um that's not related to this medicine, but I could give you something to just help you sleep longer through the night, if you wanted to try something to help you asleep he I don't have to i'm just offering it. let's talk about, can you tell any difference yet on your anxiety, with the best part is it too soon."
11710.0,Patient,"um I don't know I feel like it might be too soon, because I feel like I don't know i've been doing other. Coping stuff that's what my therapist seem to. Like i've been learning a lot and other stuff, so I think that's been helping with my anxiety, but the past couple days, though i've been like pretty anxious has been hard for me to like go to bed because of it i'll just have like obsessive thoughts."
298.0,Provider,"Now, if you miss the middle of the day, dose take it at that time, it also might help you with sleep also so i'm trying to get a 24 hour level this medication has good results, but you have to take it long term enough for it to work, but of course. What you do in therapy is even better than medicine."
11710.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"And so that makes me excited that you didn't have negative side effects, other than this bizarre waking up but I don't think it was this medicine. Okay um. What are your thoughts on having an as needed sleeping medicine in the House."
11710.0,Patient,i'm.
298.0,Provider,not needed.
11710.0,Patient,"yeah maybe not needed, I mean what would the side effects the other if there."
298.0,Provider,"Oh yeah it could be too high, of a dose and you wake up feeling groggy like you didn't sleep enough that's been that because I don't know how much it takes to get you to sleep. That can be a side effect is your you want to sleep too much. that's about the only one. it's not really addictive it's not so that you wouldn't have to worry about."
11710.0,Patient,I think i'll hold off on it.

298.0,Provider,Well let's try the next level of the first person to wear the starting dose. And if you want to take the middle dose and put it at nighttime near bed you're welcome to do that because it's really a 24 hour level that we're looking for. Or you can keep it in the day you're going to start to feel it with this next dosage and you're still not anywhere near a Max dose but you're at a dose that you should start feeling it that that it should start kicking in helping with anxiety.
11710.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Any suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Okay how's your you said, your appetite was poor but it's back."
11710.0,Patient,"yeah the first, I think. week or two I just had like really no appetite or I would feel really nauseous but for now it's fine I mean you're eating normally now so."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, good. All right, any questions for me."
11710.0,Patient,I want to know is it. Is it fine if i'm on a birth and triple A combination.
298.0,Provider,"yeah boost par. does not. where's my book, here it is. Let me just make sure, but I don't think boost part changes and lowers the risk, the level of years it's a oral birth control correct yes. Okay. nope it'll be fine you'll be doing good with that. It won't least lessen the effect of it great question."
