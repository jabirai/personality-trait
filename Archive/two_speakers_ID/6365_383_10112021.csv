I got covert again my son got covert actually and then I got over it again so. that's a quarantine and it's it's we didn't have any symptoms, the only reason we found out is because um. He was coughing and you know I know he's in school, and because of that, I wanted the peace of mind, so I went to test them and he turned out, he was positive. yeah turned out, he was positive, so. I tested myself as well, I came back negative and then I had to take care of him so as the days went by I decided to get tested again and I came out positive but we didn't have any symptoms that showed, at least, I think, internally, something happened to my body, because. Every other night or every. every few nights I wake up with like a cough attack, but during the day i'm completely fine so. Do you mind i'm going to close my door really quick. Sorry it's open. Okay sorry yeah so and, of course, my pointing period is over, but my my bosses are pretty they're older and they just don't want to risk it and I work in in taxes and the final extension deadline is on the 15th so they don't want anyone there. You know, anyone. yeah. yeah I haven't you work from home, do you do any work from home. or no i'm not so i'm kind of worried yeah i'm not getting paid so i'm i'm applying for unemployment today for those two weeks it's already been over two weeks actually yeah it's been over two weeks already. Given off mm hmm yeah and then I think i'm just going to start looking for a new job I think it's time."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, why are you feeling that."
6365.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know I think there's definitely been a shift but i'm. i'm not growing whether it's me or the company i've already been here two years and i'm not really growing and. It hasn't gotten I don't know I haven't I haven't really grown, so I think it's time to try something else."
383.0,Provider,I see. yeah stay in the same field of. Working with taxes and accounting.
6365.0,Patient,"i'm not sure that that's why i'm kind of i'm I am stuck in limbo I don't know what I want to do next, but I do like finance a lot I just it's hard, because I don't have the education to really do what I want input and I don't want to settle for less at the same time. But I mean i'm positive so there's there's something out there, for me, where I can grow. yeah. Okay, but they don't really offer benefits they don't. The first year I got a bonus kind of like a sign on bonus, but then after that. You know there's there's no bonus there's no recognition. yeah I i'm kind of noticing all these. Things now."
383.0,Provider,I see i'm. Sorry cooled off here and I.
6365.0,Patient,"getting a little yeah. same here, I just have to close my window."
383.0,Provider,"yeah so um, what do you feel like you want to talk about nine know, one of the goals that you had mentioned before you know, I just wanted to say this was you had talked about attending. or completing an educational. program and one of that was one of your goals, when we discussed and one of our appointments was to complete. an occasional process, so I was wondering if thats related to your employment if if that would enhance your employability and what your thoughts were on completing that where you were with that."
6365.0,Patient,"I stopped I kind of stopped. yeah I don't know. I don't know what it is, I kind of just thought like. abruptly, I guess, I didn't. I don't know. I don't know I don't even know where i'm at with that I wish I could have finished at least just to say that I finished it and kind of have it on my resume but. Once covert hit. I mean, I was still active and doing other projects but mentally I was just not there anymore. You know right before Kobe I was doing so much, I was like. Here in there i'm sorry i'm going to close my door one way. yeah once once covert hit. I don't know I just. Oh yeah i'm sorry right before then, I was really active, and so my momentum was like here, and then, once coven hit you know, like, I was forced I couldn't do I couldn't do anything and i'm pretty strict with like quarantining only because. I had mentioned like i'm not vaccinated so I don't want to. You know, cause any harm or at least. To my knowledge, so I was pretty strict with that, so I went like from doing so much to a complete halt. And I think that kind of messed with my head, I was kind of comparing it to. When you're exercising a lot. you're not supposed to stop because I kind of stopped your heart rate and it's really dangerous or you kind of have to. keep moving. So i've been thinking about that and i'm like maybe that's kind of what caused my I always say motivation, but I hate the word masturbation to just like kind of stopped completely."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. well. So what do you feel like you want to I mean, is it motivation and getting clarity of regarding what you are moving toward what you want to work on in therapy."
6365.0,Patient,"i'm kind of just rolling with the punches right now I don't have clarity right now i'm not sure I mean I. me, it does help me like really sings and grow and kind of realize what I want it's just a matter of me, putting them into practice."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well, so a couple of things, I just want to note in your chart. We talked about in back in August and sometimes it's good to kind of like just self reflect okay when we're talking about an August, like. So back in August, you were talking about like we would written written down some goals related to not giving into unproductive impulses and. You know, when you got home from work try to get to sleep earlier and. and acknowledge areas in your life, where you were accomplishing your goal so in some parts of your life you felt like you were accomplishing goals so to acknowledge that and then also to. You know, try to not do things that you felt were unproductive so just instead of say okay i'm going to do this, and this, and this kind of you know we can take things in different ways and approach things sometimes. If we approach things in certain ways it kind of coaxes us and in such a way to get something accomplished that we want to do so, one of them was to let me not to do these things, so let me not do unproductive things, maybe scrolling on your phone. So, and let me see if I can engage in relaxing but you know productive activities after work like we talked about well I have written down here like you know self care things yoga stretches those kinds of things. So. How we doing what so that's it. Okay, so a couple of things we were talking about in and back in August was you're going to write down your goals and dreams and you're going to talk about it, and one of your appointments and then the other thing was you were just going to you know complete. Some bright heart health, you know surveys and stuff stay on top of your appointments with beinart health, the surveys, the attending one group, a month. and so forth, so um. And then, our last appointment in September. was basically like you know. You want you talked about finishing the tax course and getting that certificate to. Complete compete in a boxing match next year. yeah and then be promoted for a higher position in your current company."
6365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,So.
6365.0,Patient,"Definitely not there. I mean i'm still productive in other ways, but."
383.0,Provider,"I mean it productivity and getting clarity on what you know, on your life objectives is not what you feel like you need right now and therapy, we can talk about. You know if there's something coming up with your relationships with your mom or your family or you know there's certain there's other things we could discuss."
6365.0,Patient,"Oh you're just saying like what I mean yeah yeah fits Okay, can we not talk about object, just because it's a little overwhelming, and I think."
383.0,Provider,Absolutely. And it feels too much right now and you're just dealing with yeah we don't We absolutely don't have to go there and how we can talk about something else I just was. Thinking just who's wondering what you feel like you want to use your appointment time for.
6365.0,Patient,"Oh, I knew that sorry I wasn't sure where we were going with that it's not that it's overwhelming i'm just. i'm. So what I how I visualized myself it's like you know how the show, sometimes in movies, where the person ends up. I don't know if it's a dream, but she ends up in like a room and it's completely white and she doesn't know which way to go, because it's just completely that's kind of how i'm feeling and it's not i'm still taking the steps it's just. i'm not there yet, and I know myself, and I know my life something just has to like. honestly. Right now, in comparison to like a few days ago i'm doing a lot more, I think I started working on my house on my in my apartment again but. i'm getting closer I just I started waking up early now I started working out again. Because I stopped. For those two weeks, and it. It I think mentally it hurt me a lot one because i'm not being social and i'm not a social person as it is. So those boxing classes, or the gym classes really helped me, you know with with that social aspect. And also not exercising I lost all my muscles so it's like my confidence paddling down. And just being home with my kiddo it was. I think it's more hurt me more mentally than physically. Discovering but but i'm getting back. To like you know my my regular schedule i'm the guy that I was talking to actually josh he reached out again and the universe, has a way of showing you someone's true colors, but we did talk for a few days and then he wanted to take me out and. And suddenly he I saw kind of this narcissism through his words and through our conversation, and it just. It turned me off completely, so I kind of cut that off completely."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6365.0,Patient,"um let's see what else I just hung out with my family yesterday and. it's always the same thing with my family it's but you know I i'm learning to validate myself a little more and it's also because i've met in this past year i've met. A couple people kind of mentors are spiritual. I call them my spiritual mentors because they're they're very spiritual and they they're they're very intuitive so they'll tell me things that. You know, as a therapist you connect the dots based on what I tell you, and then there's like someone who's maybe you are i'm not here but someone who's spiritual and intuitive they connect the dots kind of as a perceived. But anyway, I become I met some of these women who are like that, and they kind of validated me in a way that no one has in my life. And so, when I do have these issues with families or with with family members or with friends now I tend to like just validate myself again like go remember who you are choice it's not. it's not really how I was gonna say it's not you it's them but it's not like that it's more like. we're all different and it's kind of like it's not your fault, like it's okay it's it's not your problem, to deal with it's not. it's not your responsibility to try to make it better you don't have to feel guilty, you know so it's i'm doing a lot of that self positive self love, which is helping me a lot. Okay um. But yeah let's see what else. yeah. it's been challenging with my son he took. out a challenge on."
383.0,Provider,Old is your son now.
6365.0,Patient,"he's mine. Okay, but he he's he swears he's the parent. And it's hard I, I have a hard time, maybe because I was raised by my mom who was very like you know just do as I say, don't question anything. So I try to find a balance between. Like not trying to be like that, but at the same time, I still need him to listen to me."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6365.0,Patient,"And I think, maybe it's because I go back and forth about it in my head that i'm not I don't. Like I don't show him like this strong parent. You know what I mean the strong parent like character, or so I think he kind of senses my doubt and so you're telling me even more."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6365.0,Patient,"But yeah yeah it's been it's been a little talk with him I I don't know, I think it was easier when his dad and I were both in the picture because. I could play good cop and bad cop, when I needed to, but now it's like I have to be full so. it's on now it's been years but now that he's getting older he's more opinionated and more you know, wants to his way he tends to wine a lot and i'm like. I don't know where I went wrong, I never wind as a child, but also my mom we were we weren't allowed to wine, you know it just wasn't part of our. Our household and growing up for so many years, I thought that's how we should be kids should not wine, and then I you know with reading and researching I realized that a kid whining it's just him being comfortable around you and or you know kid i'm. Like like we didn't really cry in front of our parents and I realized that it's okay for him to pray because That just shows that he trusts me and that you know he's not trying to impress me he just he is he's okay with showing me his feelings. actually have a friend, whose child never lines never cries never and it just. I think, maybe years ago I would have thought, like wow she's like the perfect child, you know she doesn't complain she does everything along. Even her mom says like. You know I don't even know how I got so lucky like I don't I don't have to ask her twice, you know."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6365.0,Patient,"But and how like you know after learning kind of about my own traumas and why I was like that I realized that it's not healthy that and I, and I can see through the little girl like I see me in her it's weird but um. yeah i'm just like you know she's she's she's gonna have to heal these things later on in life. And then me and my child, on the other side of the spectrum."
383.0,Provider,Excuse me um.
6365.0,Patient,let's see.
383.0,Provider,"Thanks. So just a couple of questions, what kind of relationship does your son have with his staff, do you know what their dynamic is."
6365.0,Patient,"yeah he he adores his dad his dad I don't think he paid enough attention to him, and I think. I think that's why he he made like he always defend him I, no one can ever talked about who said, because you know he'll be the first to dependency how great of a dad he is or i've been through moments where like he. Like I think I picked him up once from his dad's house and he started crying and he's like you know my I feel so bad for my dad he has to work so much. And he has to do this, and this and that and i'm just like, why are you feeling sorry for your dad and you know my thoughts I started analyzing everything. And i'm like for a child to feel bad for that is because his dad has told him something and so anyway, I got really upset so I call this that the next day and i'm like you don't need to. Your your child should have pity you, you know, and so I started explaining to my son that everybody works, you know, and I started giving him different examples of like his uncle's and. family members who also have that same work schedule and it's Okay, and he said it's fine and is that healthy and. And, and he shouldn't feel bad for him, you know he's he's perfectly capable adults and perfectly capable of taking care of himself. But he'll just things like that or. he'll he'll try to impress him more so than he does to me and I don't know if that's a toxic thing, or is it I don't think his dad is very present to to my, you know as far as I know, or my perspective."
383.0,Provider,Do you feel like you want to. Express more clear boundaries to your son or or you want him to you how would you like it to be with your son with in relation to his relationship with you how would you like him to.
6365.0,Patient,"Well, honestly, the thing that annoys me the most is that he winds he teaches complains a lot and it's like I have to tell them two or three times to do something. And then, at that point, I have to raise my voice and I tell him and i'm like I told you in a nice way one time, I told you a nice way twice, I even give you a limit like eight and you have five minutes to do this i'm going to come back in five minutes. And you don't listen, I have to raise my voice, and if you don't listen to me reason you're. Raising my voice, and I have to take action, I have to take you by the hand, you know to work, wherever you have to go. But, and I, so I do this, and it seems effective in my head or you know from what i've read and it's just not it's like the same thing happens and next time it's like. it's tiring and then you know and and then he'll he'll react once I get upset and then he'll he'll say something like i'm being rude here like you're being silver and. At that point i'm just upset i'm like excuse me, you know, like you, don't get."
383.0,Provider,A client.
6365.0,Patient,"Food i'm the one discipline you because you haven't done this, and this and that."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
6365.0,Patient,"that's when i'm already flustered i'm frustrated, you know he."
383.0,Provider,yeah so. hmm and what kinds of things to see complain about.
6365.0,Patient,"A lot, I have a board I have like we actually started this board where it's like we we tally so on one side it's like when he complains and when mommy yells. So we tell you we try to set up a system, but it didn't work he complained so. And so you know, then I forget and like I mean I don't threaten him, but I tell him like i'm going to add another tally who's your complaining again and he's like no because you said this in this lettuce like but he'll complain about like i'm Okay, then it's time to take a shower. But no, but blah blah blah and i'm like I don't want to hear complaining of you have five minutes and then it's time to shower but eight and then it's just more complaining or it's time to oh my gosh for everything it's like there's it's complaining for everything."
383.0,Provider,I see I say I don't want to I don't. I don't like this that kind of thing yeah complaints.
6365.0,Patient,"yeah and and sometimes they'll stop and i'm like you know, like we go through this every time. You you you're a nine year old you know if you were three, then I would I would have to explain more but you're nine you know, like you understand, we do this every day you, you understand, we do. And then I don't maybe i'm wondering if, like maybe we don't have a structure, you know, like a set structure where."
383.0,Provider,"I was just gonna say like what is your do you have a structure that is up on the board kind of like. Expectations you know or, this is what happens during the during the week you know you shower come home from school and do your homework."
6365.0,Patient,I do.
383.0,Provider,"Like 30 minutes of free time than you we do this, and all that does he."
6365.0,Patient,"yeah I tried it's just I think we do have that out i'll show you. implement them properly, but. I just to show you. So we have this one, it says morning routine I don't know if you can see. uh huh okay. So and and it's you know it says everything from getting dressed for oh cuz he so and every morning it reminds me when I was a child, which really makes me wonder why he's like that, but. He forgets everything and I used to forget everything my mom would I mean she didn't have to, but she ended up tying like the little string on my finger, so that I can remember. And then, and I remember just playing with a little string, but I would forget everything my I think my thing was that my brain was so full of what's the stress. Hormone with all yeah that I just you know I didn't remember anything but. aiden you know we'll get ready and i'm like did you brush your teeth, did you wash your face do you have your mouse where's your backpack where your lunch box and everything's there he's just like ready to go without anything and. So we have this, but we implemented for like a week and then it's done, and then I have like. The tally one, and then I have a bit time one."
383.0,Provider,"let's see the bed time when, if you could show me. This you have it so organized. It is time is nine. You pick the Alpha for the next day brush your teeth you drink your water and you read and then time for bed Okay, so I think that may be, what might need to have a new habit already organized. That you need to go over it, with him, like. You know what let's go over a weekly routine you know i'm. This is the routine. And I don't know if you want to go over it like maybe twice like maybe like on Sunday, and then on Wednesday, you know so that he gets it twice that you go over okay let's and then and maybe ask him how is this routine, how does it sound to you. Anything that you think we should put in there, that you would like to put in there, I don't know what it would be but. Okay, and so. When I say it's 830 that means it's time to start your routine you know your routine your bedtime get ready routine. And if you do this like well throughout the week let's have a reward system. So I think that have you implemented a reward system."
6365.0,Patient,not really nothing that's worked efficiently so if you have any ideas.
383.0,Provider,"Well, you know if he does the routine like morning, then he could an evening he could get a star, you know, for that day. You did your routine this morning you did your routine this evening. I don't know how you know when you would be evaluating whether it was like well last night's bedtime in this mix this morning, or whatever you could evaluate when I don't know how you want to work that out, but if you get five stars like you would get. I mean you could give him money I don't know if that works, I mean if that would be work for you or it could be you get. You know I don't know how with what he likes you know you guys could go. Out there on Friday, or something like that. If he gets five stars if he gets like four stars, you could still get something you know if he gets the majority of of of nights you know with stars. and start to see if you can implement some kind of reward system if that will motivate him."
6365.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,now complaining. Is kind of tricky because it could be.
6365.0,Patient,anything.
383.0,Provider,Like what is he wanting from you yeah like is he wanting just you to pay attention to him. Or is he just generally disgruntled you know and kind of in a. Down mood.
6365.0,Patient,"No, no, never done when he's a he's a really happy child. she's, no, no. I mean, I do spend time with him I. mean he's he started I started to play video games this past year I started letting him. With his friends and I think it's gotten a little out of hand. Okay need free time I let him play. yeah I need a non."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. You know the other thing is that you can implement harder boundaries like i'm not listening to complaints period and a story, this is what's expected of you."
6365.0,Patient,"yeah I do that, and you know some days are better than likes it and it really just depends on on me like he I think he can read me pretty well."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6365.0,Patient,"So if i'm pretty strict or Stern, and I, and I don't you know, like no bs kind of mood. Enough and say okay fine you know, but even then it's like okay fine it's not know, and I don't know how how annoying you're supposed to think because. I know growing up my mom would always tell me like why don't you think this way why don't you think Oh, why don't you know I do this to some that you know, and I always hated when my mom would say that cuz i'm like I don't think that way you know as a child. And so I kind of have the same. kind of toxic expectation that I didn't like, but then I think like why doesn't my chose this think like oh yes i'm to shower take a shower and then I can get back to you know it's always like. it's like it's like he wants me to get upset or he he wants to get a reaction out of me, you know it's not enough to just say okay well i'm gonna go. Since we go through this every day, let me just go take."
383.0,Provider,"huh. Do you have times when you just kind of like say like sit just sit down and talk like how school going, how do you like your classes that kind of thing."
6365.0,Patient,"yeah every day, every day, so his dad and I co parent right, so I had them from Tuesday to Sunday and then his that hasn't from some or Tuesday to Saturday, is that picks up Sunday morning, and then I pick and then drop them off on Tuesday evening. But."
383.0,Provider,You have you have them the bulk of the time.
6365.0,Patient,"I do yeah. yeah and so i'm here every time I pick him up, I asked him how school anything happened at school, when we have dinner. You know, we we talk from like anything happen in here, and he he tends to he he likes to always have my attention, since he was young, you know and it's funny I hung out with my family this past Sunday and my sister reminded us. How like if anyone else starts talking to me he'll try to like get my attention somehow I mean. it's different out he's older, but he he does, like my attention and I don't know if it's because. Maybe I give him too much attention, sometimes or i'm not giving him enough, but you know will it's it doesn't happen every day, but every other day, I want to say we three sit down and we. play like scrabble or or UNO or card games, you know just like just me and him like uninterrupted quality time."
383.0,Provider,that's good that's wonderful.
6365.0,Patient,"yeah like I said it's not every day and sometimes we'll go a whole week without but even then we'll do like reading time and if we're not reading together i'm like okay i'm going to read my book, you will read your book I i'll lay in bed you go sit on the SOFA you know. Okay, and will read for like 15 minutes. But yeah it's, not that I don't I don't think I don't pay attention to."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay so maybe when he's complaining one strategy might be just to ask him, like is everything okay like are you okay is everything okay and they'll be like yeah everything's Okay, and then okay great. everything's okay you doing good will have done, maybe try and change his. change the subject line will be having dinner and more can be having like scotty for dinner, and right now, you know, please go do your homework and then we'll get you know we'll get together we'll have our spaghetti dinner and. then go through your bedtime routine sometimes it's just like avoiding the behavior like just. kind of not paying as much attention. With the exception of just like that check in like your I hear you're just kind of whining a lot like are you are you okay is everything okay like. Not in a sarcastic way at all, you know that that I think it's really I mean I don't. I don't i'm not a parent and I will say that i've been around. You know i've been around my family and. And my. sibling has kids and I I hear her sometimes saying things with a sarcastic tone which I don't think that. that's not that's that's a slippery slope."
6365.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it is news and and. I don't know if it's my child but he's he's so sarcastic I mean i'm. sarcastic too I. I was very witty as a child very sarcastic and like woody and he's the same way, so I found sarcastic you'll read right through me and feel like throw it back right at me. Okay."
383.0,Provider,"yeah because that's you, but if you're genuine and you're like is everything okay okay okay yeah everything's okay okay great okay so we're just going to you know will be. let's just stand out of course do your homework and then we're going to you know we have to get spaghetti or whenever and and let's stay on track because essentially okay we've led to be grateful for. And you'll get your and also remind him like go get your free time it's good to have free time you know you're good. You know, once you're done with your homework and if you get the five stars, you know you're. gonna will have a nice dinner at the end of the week or. You know, to not play into it, in a sense."
6365.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,Like if he's complaining and you're like oh my gosh you're complaining so much and then it's kind of instead of just like change channel you change.
6365.0,Patient,"jenna yeah yeah that's true maybe you could be like i'm getting something out of it, I. don't know that that that little attention that little Oh, I have the power, still have I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah right right. And that's why you actually by giving him an opportunity for him to actually tell you, if something's not Okay, is giving him attention you know we're saying okay you're kind of complaining a lot i'm just wondering is everything okay like overall. Oh yeah yeah okay great okay so, then you change the Channel you don't know them, why are you complaining, you know, then you go into the negative trough you know what's it."
6365.0,Patient,"yeah cuz he's also not like that, with other adults only with me i've seen him with other adults that's my or oh my gosh like I have in my boxing class. Some kids started joining, so I decided to take him with me and he just come he winds so much and he gets very disrespectful to where I have to. show this other side that no one knows in my boxing class is very strict mother's side and. it's uncomfortable because I don't want to have to discipline my child in this class where i'm supposed to like be having fun and you know enjoying. And so, but and it's funny because I do want him to start boxing classes, so I took him to another class with like a private instructor. A private class and he did so well just him them to one on one he did so well the instructor was so happy with him he's like he has. So much potential and I kind of I kind of peaked and he was paying attention, no, no, whining no complaining. Right, why do other adults have and I recognize it but i'm like how come I don't have this this ability to you know, or why does my child have to wind up so much and out with other adults. mm hmm yeah it's tough but."
383.0,Provider,Maybe I think that being maybe more direct and your communication and more assertive in your communication might be helpful and it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be throw down the strict discipline but you're just going to be more direct. And in your communication with them. yeah.

6365.0,Patient,"Okay i'm gonna try them. Okay, well, I feel like i'm. Like I said i'm kind of in limbo, right now, so I don't we can end it early and then I know I have another appointment on the 25th.
