No, no, so brief overview basically our first session i'm just going to ask. for you to tell me like in your own words things you think are important for me to know whether it's childhood stuff adulthood stuff some people don't like to go through everything in the first session, which is okay. So it's pretty much individual sessions are pretty much just whatever you feel like you need to get out of. Whether it's coping skills or trauma resolution any of that i'm very open to feedback if i'm ever talking about things that you feel like aren't important just let me know and we'll shift so i'm pretty much this is your time and i'm just here to help you process things."
14176.0,Patient,"I really appreciate it. well. there's. So much that I don't even know. My entire life I swear if you if you could write enough books, it would just be a never ending number one hit drama drama crazy adventure just non stop. crap. um but, starting with the most recent situation, I guess, I am officially homeless, as of today, super cool I got arrested, two weeks ago I got a good fit for my apartment due to getting arrested and and. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh i'm so sorry, what kind of led up to the arrest."
14176.0,Patient,"So um I missed my neighbor I was arrested a version for assault and they dropped all charges, saying that I was within my rights to protect myself that. i'm so essentially I was living like I tell people all the time, like i'm a crazy person because i'm really not great at being in control of my emotions i'm I have like Road rage really bad to get angry about everything.

Drug and I don't know and also probably mental face, just like me, but who knows, whatever. She constantly was so the wall between us was her bedroom in my bedroom. and whatever hours of the day that she decided that she was going to go on these rampages she would start screeching and screaming and using what I would refer to as like her devil voice. And she would slam herself and things against the wall, she would turn the faucet on in the House and start playing and buckets of water, all the whole time just screaming yelling hollering and more out of. I don't know if it was always specifically directed to me, or if it was just her normal routine of verbiage, but right, it was constantly. All of this you're you're a racist Arab terrorists and you have a stupid dog and i'm going to get you and there's men they're gonna follow you and, like she would just like in what I interpreted as her attacking me."

Like I wouldn't be coming home from like a two hour, like, I have a dog. And so I would you know i'm a Saturday wake up take him out maybe we go to the park for a while I go and get coffee I go into my grocery shopping run some errands whatever. And then I be coming home around one or two o'clock in the afternoon and I come home and literally within minutes of me being home i'd get a knock on my door COPD and I. i'm sorry what's going on and they're like we have complaints about you and i'm like, how can you have a complaint sorry my."

I know it sounds like maybe paranoia like hallucinations or voices."
480.0,Provider,that's kind of what i'm thinking is going.
14176.0,Patient,"So i've called the office several times, I called the police on the time that i'm like me, I like i'm sorry i'm calling the police like this, like it's just noise complaints at this point and. Like i'm concerned like if she alive, if she like she slammed ourselves against the walls and stuff like what the heck is going on there, and so one morning I was taking out my dog and she came at me in the hallway was like i'm going to kill your dog. Like no you're not. i'm so amazed her and I ran."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14176.0,Patient,"And she called the police and the police at first were saying um Oh, she called the police, saying that you attacked her and meet her, so we have to arrest you and i'm like I didn't attack her, she was trying to attack me. And I always do is protecting myself and my dog is that i'm not gonna let anything happen to him, there was an disabled man down in pioneer square close to my living situation he had a service dog as well and somebody was I, the report says, I like money or drugs or whatever it's something. Protecting his dog. and killed his dog. And I was like i'm not gonna let that happen to my dog my dog is all he's only 17 pounds and I have this person I don't know what she's capable of doing but she's coming at me in the hallway saying she's gonna kill my dog, what do you think my choices are. Right i'm like well why don't you just run."
480.0,Provider,"And then, because fight or flight mode they."
14176.0,Patient,"literally have a tool to use to keep myself safe that's why I have pepper spray. yeah i'm not going to allow them to talk to happen i'm presenting an attack all together. Right um earlier so i've been living at the park when I was at from January and up until yesterday. um what I had first moved in. His fifth and back down know if you're familiar with area downtown chinatown but, so the transit Center was basically across the street, for me, and I was walking to starbucks every day at the transit Center with my dog to get a coffee every morning just my normal routine. Getting out in the morning and I had a really huge lady chased me through the transit Center time that she was going to be my ass. Who this person is I don't know what their motive was. And I was running through the training Center scoop my dog up and. You got close enough to me and she's like raising your arms and running at me and I made her as well and kept running I ran into starbucks store and with loan officer showed up to help me get back home, but I was like this is crazy, this is crazy I can't do with this."
480.0,Provider,yeah I didn't know Seattle was that dangerous.
14176.0,Patient,"It it's really bad there was. A lady that was standing at the bus stop and this by passing her he, like. I don't know in Mali walked her over the head or something and. walk around her face sure like deacon knows shattered because of the impact. When when the police, he went and hopped on the bus behind and when police caught up with him, he said that it's because the voices said to get that woman. Like it's it's really bad downtown and I I just I was fed up, I was upset I was scared. Then I just i'm actually really glad I don't live there anymore, because. The situation when I first moved in there was a guy that would be in the lobby every day with a pocket knife talking about he's gonna stab somebody."
480.0,Provider,Like just give me a really scary to live with that every day.
14176.0,Patient,"And so um I would try to just there was a courtyard that I made for parking for between my building and another building and it was also really frustrating, because the complex that I was living at. Instead of being able to use so in in the courtyard they had a garage door that's needed access, you have to have the key fob."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14176.0,Patient,"So for me it was like the ultimate safety zone. Right, no one is there that doesn't belong there's every once while there'd be like a homeless person or drug addict or something in there, but like. nine times out of 10 they're getting chewed out by maintenance or security. Right and um I was really frustrated because my apartment complex would not grant us key fob access to the direct door."
480.0,Provider,"To them, where you're from our building."
14176.0,Patient,"I can go out that door all day long but. In order to go back into my building. I would have to go out the main street go around the block and then go to another door, on the other side. And I kept telling them like this is such a safety hazard the. yeah I pay to use this garage, why should I have to leave the safety and comfort of this secure garage area to go out to the real world, just to go home every day, regardless of. What time of day, it is. And they they were just relentless they just did not care. And so I being smart and somewhat rebellious I was using a magnet to put in the door latch every day, so that door. And I even had maintenance like. of my own building like he personally attacked me he was like what, why do you think you're above the rules and I was like i'm doing what I can to keep myself safe and he goes, you know, maybe, if you didn't dress a certain way you wouldn't have problems. Oh listen, it is summertime and I will definitely wear shorts and tank tops every single day of the week and i'm not having issues with men I. do not care about men, I have had issues with men, since I was 10 years old, growing boobies I do not care. yeah that's not what my issue is my issue is the safety and the security of myself and my dog, whether that be a man or woman a vehicle whatever. Man, but I just I said there's zero reason for me not able to use a key fob. right out of that door and he said well you're letting people and homeless people crackheads into the. stairwell everything. i'm like no i'm not. i'm literally in the Court here long enough to walk my dog for five to 10 minutes to do this business."
480.0,Provider,I don't have any of that I asked.
14176.0,Patient,"The door and then I go back and no one's. going to and from my door, I think, maybe once or twice someone had like actually they were like working around already and then as slipped in."
480.0,Provider,But i'm like that kind of. issue with someone coming out that might have nothing to do with the magnet thing you know.
14176.0,Patient,"That and also at the main entrance people are camp, I have people follow me and all the time i'm not going to confrontational put myself in a position of like. hey you're not supposed to be here, if someone followed me, and I would just make a detour to like checking my mail for like an extra amount of time of like. Oh that's weird I didn't get anything today let's check the second mailbox like the standard i'll check my phone like wait why I had noodles today only. yeah like giveaways like me because it's like a triple secure door, so that they don't get into the second the third door they're just stuck there. So I just wait till they just leave back out to the entrance or something. um but, so I, I think that is it's an unfortunate circumstance that I had to go through mom getting arrested going to jail and."
480.0,Provider,How long are you in jail.
14176.0,Patient,Just over 24 hours waiting upon release.
480.0,Provider,So I got booked on.
14176.0,Patient,"Thursday what was a two weeks ago. So, not the second but it's whatever was right before August. The 27th so the 26 is the incident happen and I got arrested around like nine or 10am. And then I seen well I didn't see a judge I got escorted into the courtroom they said no charges filed released. Have a great day and."
480.0,Provider,Oh so it's like completely dismissed gone off you're right.
14176.0,Patient,"I never seen i've never seen an attorney or. The. person you're supposed to talk I don't know what they're called I think it's attorney but a public defender, I never seen. Oh yeah under I never even spoke to anybody about my keys, and I didn't get addressed by the judge. Like there was no interaction I just got escorted into the courtroom. And then, they said Okay, no charges filed. And I say good luck. And I said Okay, thank you. that's what I thought was going to happen. i'm sorry I like to me, this is just really bonkers that i'm even in this. situation, and so, then I got the ultimate Dale experience because of this whole covert thing they're taking everybody from King county to our JC going back to King county for court and then releasing everyone from our JC so I got transcripts three times."
480.0,Provider,In 24 hours.
14176.0,Patient,"Transfer three times I also got to get a boat cut it out of the transportation bus because I got stuck. They said that was never happened before so first time experience for everyone, I said yourself included I didn't know this could happen."
480.0,Provider,wow.
14176.0,Patient,"You have to have the the handcuffs to the to the waist thing. yeah and the lock drop behind the seat and they could not get me out, they have to cut me out."
480.0,Provider,There to cut the chain.
14176.0,Patient,yeah they have used the big huge bolt cutters and. The bus.
480.0,Provider,that's so crazy yeah. So what was your first. jail experience to.
14176.0,Patient,"Technically, no and 2016 I got arrested, I was booked in released in bellevue know in kirkland i'm, for they tried to say that I hit a doctor. I took a friend that was detoxing she's trying to help from opiates I took her to the hospital and the hospital basically told her that she was suicidal. They strapped to the bed they shot her with like this orientation medication and threw me out of the room, and I was in the nurse's station going like this thing, what are you doing to my friend. she's trying to go to detox and you're treating her like she's like coming in here and killing people or cutting her arms open in front of you or something. And then security snatched me i've been through me on the ground and said stop stop resisting and i'm like i'm not resist like I don't know what's happening here and there, like you hit the doctor and like. It hit anybody and shaking a stern finger because i'm upset because you guys are treating my friend in what to me seems like a very. Caring fashion. Right, this is a hospital you're supposed to care for people and take care of them and provide them help and she's asking. for help and you guys are telling her that she's lying like they told her that her drug test came back clean and that she has a benzo problem and not an opiate problem and she's like I don't understand what you're talking about I am smoking pills daily."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14176.0,Patient,"How can I have a clean drug test and not you know, one of the results are from that but. I. thought it dropped to disorderly conduct in a hospital setting. I hired a lawyer for that keys um he's I was like i'm not I did not hit a doctor their security cameras in all directions I review the footage and drop the charges like this is ridiculous."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14176.0,Patient,"But at that time they literally handcuffed me took me to the facility, they took my fingerprints did the whole search things gave me all the information and paperwork and then told me, I was free to go."
480.0,Provider,So you've had to have these arrests that like didn't turn in anything.
14176.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm actually several back in 2009 2010 I was going to the municipal court for my boyfriend who had a dui and I had brought in the marijuana pipe and my first by accident. So upon entering the Court room, it was discovered in my first they put me in a holding so I had a panic attack and they released me and they they didn't give me any kind of medical response, they kind of freaked out that I was freaking out."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14176.0,Patient,And they just kind of threw me out of the courthouse.
480.0,Provider,wow. This was all in Seattle.
14176.0,Patient,"That was in Kent. But everything else was Seattle and kirkland and then in 2012 the guy that I was dating had me working as a prostitute. And situation had gone bad and he made me call 911 and play my rape charge and because he was on my phone threatening the guy they took me to jail after the rape kit was completed and they said that I was going to jail for extortion, which was a felony charge."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and it wasn't you, it was the guy that did it."
14176.0,Patient,And so I was in jail for a whole weekend King county. And then. I spoke to the public defender and I seen the judge and they PR me on no charges filed with the. With the intention of as long as I don't get in trouble for two years unsupervised probation that there would never be any charges filed.
480.0,Provider,you've been through a lot. And I know that's probably just like the ice tip of the iceberg. yeah oh.
14176.0,Patient,"i'm so my husband, I am a now married I just had my sixth wedding anniversary. In July. And we are desperately trying to get a place to live now because he's currently incarcerated and his release is dependent on my providing of an address for him to come home to. So that's been really stressful this past week week and a half now because I did not expect to get an eviction notice. I did talk to the tenants advocate people and housing protection authority and they said that i've been having strong case to fight it they didn't think that an eviction. Was legal based on being arrested on property. Especially since they said, there was no charges filed yeah. But they said that ultimately i'm the best case scenario is that I would have to still pay all the fees to move to a different unit. hmm because of it being my direct neighbor and it's an ongoing basis with domestic dispute. Good yeah okay. um so they basically said that it's kind of my choice, do I want to fight an eviction or do I want to move out in and have it be a better situation all together. So I weighed my odds and I just decided that it would be. Better for me to take the time I have friends that can stay with. US for me to find a safer and more secure living situation that's not in that immediate downtown area. So that's kind of what I decided to do, I went and talked to the office and explain to them like you know you put in this eviction on me, I understand that that's the legal route of what you have to do. But that's putting me in a situation of living in my car like ultimately long term if I do not find a place to live and, if I have an eviction on my record i'm not going to have that high of success rate of finding a place to. lay money is not an issue for me, I have a full time job I make pretty good money, I also just not that they know but I started a second job. And then I also donate plasma, so I have a fair fairly amount of good of income resources. My mom I said I don't know what needs to happen if I need to pay for this month's rent if I need to pay a prorated amount, but league. anytime to move me to find a place to live."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14176.0,Patient,And so they told me that as long as I communicate with them. But they won't put an eviction on my record. Good would allow me to move out and just pay a prorated amount out of my they said to just come out of the difference of my deposit.
480.0,Provider,yeah okay.
14176.0,Patient,"That I would. be okay to just move out peacefully, and so I feel like that i'm still really scared and nervous that they are going to just move forward with an. eviction and they're just postponing it um but i'm hopeful that they're being true to their word and they're, not because I asked for something in writing, and they just kind of said. Well we've already discussed what's happening and i'm like Okay, but peace of mind, like just because you told me that doesn't mean to."
480.0,Provider,Re it's not gonna hold out.
14176.0,Patient,yeah like i'm just going to run with it because I am pretty confident and fine i've already looked at like six different places.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, I have a holding."
14176.0,Patient,"Deposit on one unit, but they're not going to accept my husband, because the tax. Like based income. unit so they're like we have to have his information today. Like Well he has no information, right now, technically, he hasn't gone for six months, I can fill out the application. But he should qualify them because he has 010 credit zero everything, other than from a background and they're like well, we still have the right to tonight's on city of Seattle, I said okay well i'm not I can't play with that. Right so um I have seen three other units in like the West Seattle area. And i'm hoping to get a call back today my background and credit report just came back and I got a copy of it and it, I mean it's not the best I don't have the best credit. And I do have some dead, but i'm hoping that it'll. they'll be willing to work with me and balance out whatever. Because they do a really good tenant history."
480.0,Provider,yeah and if you haven't job that's what most people care about like proof of employment. Because they want to know you have something coming in and that's consistent.
14176.0,Patient,"Right and the really nice thing is I I worked from home and um. I I made these I make about three just over $3,000 a month."
480.0,Provider,Oh well.
14176.0,Patient,i'm pretty much any. apartments that i'm looking at i'm looking at studio one bedroom so like 1000 to 1500 a month and easily afford that.
480.0,Provider,yeah gosh Seattle so expensive.
14176.0,Patient,"yeah but um it's it's been really stressful and um I basically had a crash pack my house in three days. And I am really grateful that there was a holiday because I had Monday off, so you meet you and more. Time to pack everything, and I have some really nice friends that came and helped basically pack everything and take like Dolly box loads down to load everything up for me and then I hired a moving company to do all the furniture because i'm like this is so much."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah like i'm not going to try and carry couches and beds and tables and.
14176.0,Patient,So I made the best of it and I got it all done and I turned in my keys yesterday.
480.0,Provider,Did you put everything in storage right now.
14176.0,Patient,yeah. pretty much everything is in storage and then I just have like my immediate. clothes and toiletries and my car.
480.0,Provider,And you said you're saying with friends currently.
14176.0,Patient,"yeah okay. Okay um so i'm pretty fortunate that I have some friends that I can stay with, for you know not forever, but at least a decent amount of time until I do. get a solid place to call home."
480.0,Provider,wow that's a lot.
14176.0,Patient,And then um.
480.0,Provider,Do you have family support are you close with family and all.
14176.0,Patient,"know, unfortunately, my dad passed my my biological Father lives in New York or New Jersey and we have sort of communication, but not the strong i've ever met him in person. Though we chat here and there. His wife is battling lung cancer and brain cancer and it's really a. Hello kitty she's she has a massive her long about the size of a golf ball."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's not.
14176.0,Patient,"it's stage four and they are basically just keeping her comfortable and and. Prolonging the inevitable. But I would do the same, I wouldn't give up if I didn't have to either. yeah but it's it's really, really hard on him and obviously hard on her, and I feel more or less they go I don't want somebody down that i'm going through all this, but he has enough to deal with. yeah stressing out over his daughter, not knowing where she's living or getting attacked by packets outside like she doesn't need that right now, and my own mother, she is a. crackhead ourselves full blown meth addict and everybody, since my step dad passed away six years ago she overnight turned into a different person and basically through my brother and I out and. Has parties every day."
480.0,Provider,was your step dad the one that like raise you.
14176.0,Patient,"yeah he's been in my life, since I was two. He was the main source of providing a home for our family and my mom she's always been like the wild child at home as a partier my mom's always on drugs, my mom's always drinking. My mom surprisingly has kept out of my entire life to jobs, long term. wow even understand."
480.0,Provider,that's impressive with.
14176.0,Patient,Using that much she yeah. She was a phone operator back in the day when you can dial zero and talk to the operator.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
14176.0,Patient,"And so I remember growing up, she worked for us West operators and I go and see her at work, all the time. She works split shifts and so my dad would take us to go visit her because she literally be gone from like six or seven in the morning to like 910 o'clock at night and I never saw my mom and I had a lot of issues with that. Then, because I had so many issues of not having my mom around she quit her job and got a job at the school district that I went to school for. And then that kinda is where everything kind of went downhill, because my mom blames me for losing her really good job to take care of a child, she claims she never wanted."
480.0,Provider,Oh.
14176.0,Patient,"Overnight, my mom went from being the person I wanted the most to."
480.0,Provider,yeah. that's so hard.
14176.0,Patient,"So um. Other than the fun moments of having a mom she beat my brother and I consistently. and put us to work in the House to clean and book and she would lock us in our bedrooms and tell us that we have to practice being in jail, because that's all we're ever going to do when we grow up and."
480.0,Provider,that's a lot of projection of her own stuff on to you guys. that's so sad.
14176.0,Patient,My mom would make me write sentences that said that I was nothing more than a liar and a thief.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
14176.0,Patient,And I have to write hundreds and hundreds of these sentences every day.
480.0,Provider,"And this was a child, like a young child."
14176.0,Patient,"It started when I was nine. When we would go to friends or families houses for like like a Barbecue or. I don't know, like the football game, or just a Friday night and my parents wanted to go and kick it my mom would make me go and sit in the bathroom."
480.0,Provider,At the friend's house.
14176.0,Patient,"At other people's houses, whether or not there was kids or cousins or other friends or whatever for me to interact with my mom would say no she's in trouble, she has to sit in the bathroom unless someone's using the bathroom she better be sitting in there."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness that's awful."
14176.0,Patient,"Oh, my mom. Because my dad worked two and three jobs and he went to night school. I was left my brother is six years younger than me. And I. jokingly as a kid I always say, well, I became a mom at six years old. As an adult I look back now and i'm like oh that's not right like I literally was nine. six to nine years old, raising a baby. my brother called me mom until he was about five years old. And as a child, I thought that was just the cutest thing ever and then I still have my engineering moments like that's my baby, but like. that's really sad right. yeah I remember that night my mom would go. it's so sad because I love my mom so much I would listen to the radio stations for the bars that she would be out to hear, they have my that's my mom in the background at the club."
480.0,Provider,You just wanted that little bit of connection. wow.
14176.0,Patient,"sort of logging is outside the House. She doesn't want us up, which is coming home at two and three in the morning and it, we can follow her rules and we don't need to be in her house when she's gone. So she loved me my brother oh."
480.0,Provider,When you were little. wow did you like have to sleep outside in the yard.
14176.0,Patient,yeah she leave us a bleak those we better not be awake when she got back.
480.0,Provider,"My goodness. Is a lot of heavy trauma. And what happens when. we're young and our brains are developing and we experienced that kind of trauma is your brain literally gets. wired towards negative thought patterns and trauma responses and that's why you have such a hard time regulating emotions you're constantly in fight flight freeze mode it's like her abuse has completely shaped the way your brain functions which is so sad. The good news is, it is possible to rewire them with therapy with learning different techniques, it just takes a lot of time and work but that's so freaking painful i'm so sorry."
14176.0,Patient,I read these books and when I was in high school called a child about it. And I like I ran to the counselor's office. Like. This is literally my wife.
480.0,Provider,Did they do anything.
14176.0,Patient,"No, I just I went to drug and alcohol counseling was in high school. And it was an adult a nice Nice. Anything it was. And it goes towards like January, no, I think it was November of my freshman year. I went to school covered and Watson scratch marks. um because my my mom and my dad my mom had my data will be down so that she could be me. And I went to school, the next day, and several of my friends wouldn't leave it alone, they have asked me what happened and I told them that I just one, I gave my cat my cat scratch new budget they're like no, you are covered and bruises like something happened to you. And I just kept saying like no it's fine it's Okay, like those bruises were already there you forget it like I fell yesterday, or like whatever and so three of my friends forced me to the nurse's office and the nurse. Did like a slight examination just looked up the back of my shirt and my pants and shoes like me i'm not letting you go oh yeah. So when I was 15 I was put in foster care. And, for whatever reason, is it only lasted about six months before they took me back home."
480.0,Provider,Did you have a decent foster home.
14176.0,Patient,"credo, I was fortunate enough to buy stepsisters mommy uncle were foster parents."
480.0,Provider,Oh good.
14176.0,Patient,"And because they were only. foster parents for like ages three to seven. They the Court made an exception because they're technically we're like immediate family. So it was. A better situation they're not um. and I wanted to stay there, I didn't want to go back home um but I don't know why they decided to place me back in the home. They didn't finish any court and trial for a whole nother year. So I stayed in the home. No. I. I was only with my sister for only a few months after the New Year and they took me back that me in the home, and then we went to court, I think, in February, so they have me a home for almost a whole month with my parents was going to port against them, which was like."
480.0,Provider,How did that even happen that.
14176.0,Patient,"Should we allow. unsettling feeling in the whole wide world riding in a car with my parents to testify against them in court. yeah and my dad but guilty. My mom did not and they didn't charge her with anything they um they close the case and they returned me back home and a week before my 16th birthday my mom back all my stuff. But me and my cat on the porch that told me that I can't live in her house anymore, and that I can go figure it out and i'm old enough now."
480.0,Provider,Oh.
14176.0,Patient,So oh.
480.0,Provider,My gosh.
14176.0,Patient,"I got a job I had two jobs before my 16th birthday, I was working in a daycare facility and I was working for a phone company. And my best friend her mom took me in and I live with my best friend for the next three years, well two to three years between that and a boyfriend that I was dating. um I tried to continue going to school. I ended up going to alternative school my junior year I was working three jobs by then, I was a caregiver for my uncle who's a quadriplegic I was still working take care, and I was still working for the phone company. for jobs, I was also working at my aunt's Deli after school every day. I dropped out January of my senior year and my friends different friend, my friend john and I got a bedroom apartment in renton and I. thought that I was living the best life I was ever going to live. and I did a lot of ecstasy and a lot of partying and raves and drinking. And i'm really just trying to disorientate and forget it."
480.0,Provider,num.
14176.0,Patient,"num and. Trying to just pretend like none of that had ever happened and i'm okay now everything's fine and. Things were not really fine. I have had between the ages of 15 and i'm 31 now I probably had 40 to 45 different jobs. Both being. My own drive of wanting better, more pay better hours but or work schedule better location."
480.0,Provider,Not never but also a lot of.
14176.0,Patient,behavior issues a lot of.
480.0,Provider,Responses because you probably get triggered easily.
14176.0,Patient,"quite easily um when I worked at mcdonald's this lady freaked out on me telling me that she said, no one is for her big MAC and through that me I picked it up and throw it back at her telling her the big banks don't come was onions. I had people check so Does that mean through the drive thru window tell me I got their order wrong and i'm like i'm not the one that took the order i'm just one handing it out and. Essentially, standing up for myself, but not. The right time, the right situation stereo and i'm like i'm not a punk I don't just roll overly. You know, like it i'm i'm tough i've been through a lot and i'm not going to just stand here and let some stupid. minimum wage fast food job dictate to me like oh hey you're on back window drafters someone shuttle over the bathroom stalls here's a MOP you get to clean it up and I looked at my manager said. I have jobs to do right here this driver is backed up tenfold i'm not leaving my station to go and clean the bathroom who's on bathroom attendance, they said, you are. All man you're drafting window you're the manager of the store you're not a lot of young back window drive to you have a store to run find somebody else, and then they said you're getting a writeup clock out and go home. And i'm like fine I will, and you can still have someone else clean that up i'm not. Saying i'm sorry, but like I don't know what the issues here i'm not doing that stuff like that's why I work guys not. And like granted in the Grand scheme of things I could have just did what i'm told and kept my job, but like I didn't feel that that was fair, so I didn't I didn't agree with it i'm not gonna do it i'm."
480.0,Provider,Not a big trigger for you in justice like feeling like you've been wronged.
14176.0,Patient,"It is, I I tell people a lot like I feel like the medea syndrome, where Have you ever seen the video movies, but she's she has what she talks to Dr phil she tells them like i'm going to get them before they get me. yeah and I feel like that, like what I was like she is speaking my language. yeah like I feel like I have medea inside me like I am dumb idea of Seattle i'm like even i'm stupid things like i'm in the grocery store and like there's two people on you know one island their parts are you know slightly offset from each other, but blocking the entire way. yeah and i'll be like. hey excuse me coming through and they're both like once deepen their phone and once I looking on intently of i'm like hey come through and i'm like what the Fuck is wondering if I can people i'm trying to shop here to you know it's not all about you. By the way, like. seriously guys just. you're just so fucking importantly you just. can't have your cards out of the way, like I lose it like. instantly like I go from like nothing to like 5000 within a matter of seconds and and it's every curse word every like installed and like. I just go off on these people and and, like in the heat of the moment i'm like yeah get out of my way."
480.0,Provider,What happened yeah and i'm like I I know.
14176.0,Patient,"A in a normal situation like right now explain to you like that's not the appropriate reaction. Right and i'm like I know that I shouldn't do things like that, like just turn around go down different i'll go back outside or you know, like say it a little i'm like. You know, like. like an angry situation, just like i'm being."
480.0,Provider,"Is see here's what happens in your brain when you've had a bunch of trauma is so basically like. there's two parts of the brain that I like to talk about the prefrontal cortex, which is where rational thought logical thought decision making all of that is prefrontal cortex. The rest of our brain is like the reptilian brain right that's what all mammals, except for humans have it's the fight or flight or freeze response. And what happens when you're emotionally triggered especially people with severe ptsd like you have. When you're emotionally triggered your brain can't connect the two so there's no rational thought in the moment when you're triggered like that so that's why you're automatically going into fight or flight mode and. After the fact, you can see that probably wasn't appropriate, but in the moment you have no ability to access that rational thought. Which is why, like big picture context Just to give you a little bit of hope not always going to be like this. that's the whole point of learning to identify emotions learning coping skills, because if you can get the emotions to settle down then your brain can connect again, and you can think rationally, but. A lot of times like i've been through a lot of similar things as you have and the way that my brain works was I was so mad at myself for how I was reacting, but I was not in control of the reaction, because it was a trauma response. yeah so I had to learn that it's not my fault that i'm acting like this, yes, there is a different way, but nobody taught me that growing up, nobody taught you any of that you know."
14176.0,Patient,"My husband wants to divorce all the time, because he said he can't handle. How abusive I am to him on the phone. Because. In being incarcerated it's always a surprise whenever he's going to call me and a lot of times i'm in a work meeting or I like driving to run errands or. i'm i'm cleaning or like i'm walking the dog and i'm on a time to train of like I have to walk him and get right back to work. And I have been lashing out at him oh what. He says it's continued to get worse over the years and the he's just he's really fed up, and I mean we have good days and bad days right now we're more or less on a good situation than not but it's really upsetting. To try and continually to explain them like I don't mean to come on angry at you all the time I don't mean to call you names yell at you, and tell you how much I hate you constantly not."
480.0,Provider,Right.
14176.0,Patient,"he's like I don't understand either you love me and want our relationship, or you hate me and you're angry with me and I said it's really not that simple for me yeah wait. I don't know how to explain to you the link i'm not in control of me so often I don't know how to be."
480.0,Provider,Exact.
14176.0,Patient,"And it's like the biggest hurdle my entire life like. I don't even know, like its own you know it's like it's honestly like there's a whole other person that takes over in these situations."
480.0,Provider,"yeah and it's like that that you flip and then the the hard part is it's not until hindsight that you realize what happened and that's what's so confusing about it because that's The thing is, like so. Overall, like the whole goal of therapy is not to get rid of emotions right because emotions are fine their information for us and they're actually useful if we learn to regulate them. So regulating the emotions learning coping strategies which so we only have like 10 minutes left but real quick, I just want to teach you a couple grounding techniques that are really effective. So when you're feeling like super angry super stressed any really intense emotion. Basically anything to get your mind focused on the present moment is going to help so an effective coping skill has to have two components one, it has to take enough time for the emotion to dissipate and intensity. So you can't like a lot of people will be like well I tried breathing I said how long they're like I don't know three breaths. Going Okay, well, we got to get a little more time than that, and then the other thing is, it has to engage your mind, because the whole goal is we're trying to connect the prefrontal cortex again so. I like to start with an easy one use your five senses, to bring your awareness into the room so name five things you can see, and describe it in detail. And so, these are things you can do anywhere, because you can do it in your head, so if I were doing this, I would be like okay behind me, I see a picture. It looks like a Doc over some water, the sky looks pretty great probably stormy I also see a chair the Chair is blue it looks kinda like a bird cage like. And I would just go on and name things I see and then go to all the other senses so things I hear smell taste touch. And then, if that hasn't worked usually that's enough to get you calm to where you can like access rational thought again if you go through all five senses, but if that doesn't work then another one, I like to add after that. To engage your prefrontal cortex is. Category game so just pick like movie titles and go a through Z as many as it takes till you feel calmer so in your mind if i'm doing movie titles I would start with a and. name and movie that starts with a day, and then a B and then a C and then just keep going and part of that is you're engaging your mind, because you have to think, but then also you're distracting yourself from whatever is causing the intense emotion. So those are two things that I want you to try this week, just as you're noticing your emotional state type up see if any of those help because that's The other thing with therapy is like. everyone's different right, so there could be a list of 20 coping skills and five might work great for you, that don't work for me, so a lot of it is kind of trial and error, but these ones seem to be really effective across the board for everyone. So definitely try those. But okay I didn't want to interrupt you so."
14176.0,Patient,It like that that's really cool idea.
480.0,Provider,"it's super helpful and all of like most of what I tell you is from personal experience to like a lot of this is not just from like reading books, I mean some of it is. But a lot of it is stuff i've done trial and error with and stuff that i've learned over the years. Because that's something else people things like the goal of therapy is to get rid of anxiety and depression and all of this stuff. And that's not practical but goal is to get to a place where you can cope with whatever. mental illnesses are going on, so I still have anxiety, I still have depression it's managed very well now and. I it doesn't interfere with my daily life, but that's wasn't the case when I started therapy, so the goal of therapy is to get to a point where it doesn't interfere with daily life, and you can. cope, I mean not saying you're not going to have bad days, but I think it's completely unrealistic for people coming in and thinking like oh i'm going to get rid of all my issues when I go to therapy."
14176.0,Patient,Right.
480.0,Provider,"It just doesn't happen, but you do learn to have a different perspective, like, I said to train your brain to see things differently to not feel. Like you're probably in a lot of pain all the time, too, because people with ptsd have severe hyper vigilance so your muscles are always tight you always think you're unsafe."
14176.0,Patient,"i'm gonna be i'm just going on my lunch and staples in that. Your home already then they'll be fine but sorry um. But yeah, so I am like. I have so many situations where like sometimes I like notice it might be i'm hungry I haven't eaten, yet today and i'm really like on edge, or sometimes I, like my cousin recently she started trying to help me she calls it like unraveling the snowball. yeah um because she goes, I can tell the you spiral lot. And let everything kind of pile up on you and weigh you down because you start trying to unravel the snowball instead of thinking about all 10 things you have to do today, think about only two that you have to do right now. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"I love that that's what I love big. i'm a big big believer in prioritizing like, especially for someone that has a lot going on all the time, so make a list of what do I need to do right now, what can wait and what to others expect me to do that I don't necessarily need to do. Because you'll realize to a lot of the pressure or urgency you feel to do things or just expectations from other. People and not necessarily like. Things you actually have to do."
14176.0,Patient,"yeah and that's something I struggle with a lot is I take on everybody else's issues everybody's problems and I tried to be the hero in other people's stories. Even though my own story is crumbling down. I recently just ended a friendship over a similar kind of situation, I have a friend, she doesn't drive she has kids she just got a job she's been living on social disability. And so, she probably got a job, and it was a work from home job perfect situation for her. And then they've changed the laws for collections that she had to go into office mandatory for 45 days and she's like I have no idea how i'm going to do this, I can't even drive yeah. So I told her that I would move in with her for the 45 days I work from home, so I have flexibility to drive her to and from work every day. And then i'll just drive back to her house do my work day and come back round pick her and her kid back up from daycare and work. And it was it was a solid solution and and also was like I was hopeful, because it was going to give me kind of a break away from my own apartment of all the drama that I deal with just in in. workings and she basically ended up choosing her drug addiction baby Daddy over me like four times in two weeks to rely on him to feel her versus me that was assault situation and I just I was like I have to walk away."
480.0,Provider,"good for you for being able to do that because that's something that's hard, especially."
14176.0,Patient,"Okay, give me two minutes. Okay, one second okay okay. um but so it was really a hard situation i've been friends with this girl since elementary school. we've always kind of been there for each other. And um it was really, really hard for me to not you know, like, I was really mad at her to because i'm like we're supposed to be in this together, like we're helping each other and like. Okay i'll see you later um. Just I just felt like I couldn't keep trying to second song oh sorry I couldn't you know, try to solve her problems when I had enough problems going on."
480.0,Provider,Exactly and that's perfectly healthy boundary.
14176.0,Patient,"So I I put that boundary in place, I haven't spoken to her since July actually no it started yeah July, the first week of July so and i'm still really sadly that's one of my. good friends, but. I also have noticed that. I don't have quite as much i'm. Like conflict going on. Right now, that i've kind of eliminated her daily extreme drama scenarios with her baby Daddy is on drugs i'm. i'm like wow my my world is kind of. quieted and calm down like. Issues. Like imagine if I get rid of all my like. triggering and reacting and, like my own chaos of immediate scenarios like like this is kind of Nice so it's like it's kind of like what started me to reach out and try to get counseling started because i'm like. God, I guess that's The next step because i'm cheese in therapy and she's been trying to kind of you know, low key kind of pointing in the right direction, such and so i'm. I. Was scared. To try this i'm just because I don't really know what to expect and. Even though I don't like my circumstances of how I am a change is very hard and scary and I just. i'm hopeful and i'm optimistic about it, I just I guess i'm leery."
480.0,Provider,"No, I get that."
14176.0,Patient,"me in counseling when I was we had to do family counseling I think when I was, I was 10 or 11 but I didn't I I, personally, as a child, I was like this is the stupidest thing ever like you. are listening to me that my mom beats me every day and she's just laughing and telling you guys that it's a slap on the wrist because I didn't do the dishes i'm like no it's not. me on the wrist. Just taking me into her room and whipping me with a belt until I believe there's a huge difference and everything that's also why it's taken me some odd 1520 years to get counseling on my own accord to really fix new niches because i'm just like oh counts and doesn't work."
480.0,Provider,"In every well yeah because, how would you trust a counselor that basically like was a line to everything that was going on. I got it."
14176.0,Patient,today.
480.0,Provider,"Your schedule, you said you work from home. hmm our early morning because i'm on East coast time. Okay, so it was like super early for you today."
14176.0,Patient,it's funny because I. I I go back and forth kind of just depends on like um and I really don't know but they say that I have a bipolar disorder. borderline personality disorder. But I.
480.0,Provider,"Probably is. not going to say that's not true, but a lot of times bipolar and borderline get misdiagnosed when there's trauma and people don't understand what trauma looks like and present says."
14176.0,Patient,"i'm in. i'm. In those weren't really you know, like. I got diagnosed by a DS hs advocate person for borderline personality disorder and then, when I got arrested and. 16 for the hospital situation when I went to get a mental evaluation they told me that I probably have bipolar Type two. So I don't really know like I don't really hold true to either of those I just kind of keep them in my in my back of my mind, like all these are potentially what I have um but."
480.0,Provider,I really don't think there's any borderline because people with borderline typically are not at all self aware and you seem very self aware.
14176.0,Patient,So I don't.
480.0,Provider,"need to say anything about the bipolar, but I do not see personality disorder at all."
14176.0,Patient,"Well that's I mean that's really good to hear. But I. Am a morning ish person. Thursday, Friday Saturday I do work at 8pm to 3am."
480.0,Provider,So those 3am.
14176.0,Patient,"yeah So my first job is 8am to 5pm and then just depending on when I finished my end of day reports, I can work all the way up till 7pm and then my second job is 9pm to 3am."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so here are the options for therapy. So next week I don't have anything open the following week we could do so Monday. I have your time, it would be anywhere from one to three open and then Tuesday I have a 7am again. Wednesday you're going to be in the Monday group though right."
14176.0,Patient,yeah so I was thinking I probably stick with Mondays for this group therapy at.
480.0,Provider,3am because we can't if you have medicaid we can't do individual and group on the same day I forgot about.
14176.0,Patient,That sure.
480.0,Provider,"So we could do Tuesday, Wednesday, I could do. gosh my schedule is getting so far i'm."
14176.0,Patient,"going to say would be okay with me. yeah cuz i'm those days I wake up pretty early. So I can take either my dog goes to daycare a couple days a week or I get up early. i'm walking and. Also, potentially, if I move this weekend will be living like a couple blocks away from a park to go play at every morning."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, that would be great."
14176.0,Patient,And it's a park that I can walk you safely there and back and not have to worry.
480.0,Provider,yeah amazing oh OK so i'll put you down currently for 7am your time on Tuesday the 21st.
14176.0,Patient,"Okay, that would be perfect."
480.0,Provider,"And then I will be doing the group that you will meet, and so I will see you on Monday, because the group starts on Monday."
14176.0,Patient,"Okay, so because they said it was with Sharon stats I thought."
480.0,Provider,"yeah she's the doctor, so the group's healthcare. And a therapist so she sent me the doctor and. I went there okay it's great. We haven't started it yet so like this is all going to be new i'm excited about it. Nice and then Okay, my last question before we wrap up on the chart. This happens a lot but suicide risk is marked pretty high, are you currently struggling with suicidal ideation Okay, a lot of times that happens from intake information just if you have like past stuff going on, so i'll just uncheck that so there's no suicidal ideation at all."
14176.0,Patient,Oh yeah I told him that I don't have that issue.
480.0,Provider,"Like Emily yeah well. Some things on our I love. That we're very tasha at bright heart, but at the same time, sometimes, then it doesn't take into accountability like personal story situation type of stuff you know so. yeah uncheck it no big deal."
14176.0,Patient,"yeah no I. In my personal opinion, a feeling it's just like a like a really. Like a loser way out, you know, like like for me i'm just like that's not really an option, I do actually like my wife, I, like my family, I want to see what's next to come. Have that issue, I had a very short stint of cutting when I was in middle school high school."
480.0,Provider,"But it might be, if you told them about that that might be why."
14176.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, but it was never really like a I want to end my life I more or less want to do feel things like. yeah I believe i'm still i'm still here."
480.0,Provider,"yeah it's actually so that's actually pretty um. Common so when you're cutting it's like because the internal pain is so detached or removed or whatnot that it's like a way to feel the pain, if that makes sense. Okay, how do you spell your name because you're not coming up on here it's."
14176.0,Patient,A space. A and then.
480.0,Provider,"The space that's why. Oh, there you are okay cool all right, well, I do have to wrap up because I have another. Patient but I will see you on Monday at group."
14176.0,Patient,"Okay, when. Imagine you know, a wonderful day."
480.0,Provider,You too bye Thank you okay.
