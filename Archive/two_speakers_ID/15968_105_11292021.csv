105.0,Provider,"I gotcha. Okay, so we're going to go to pretty sure that gets. done let's move over to another section pretty much the formal stuff is done, but now I want to move into creating at least three goals. they're yours, though not mine not whatever you think i'm up to or not up to they need to be things that you're actually interested in either doing this, I like to keep it sort of simple. Maybe making a statement of I want and think of something want to do more, of or you may be thinking there's something I want to do less of let's start with the substance use again this is your goal in your wording, something you want to do more, of or less, of how would you phrase that. Like adhere to the program or is that too much so there's an end in it. So sobriety so, for example. From what. Okay, is there any other substance, you want to maintain or you want to have a goal around a lot of people use multiple substances."
15968.0,Patient,Well i'm also in the process of quitting smoking cigarettes.
105.0,Provider,"I want to quit smoking cigarettes as a goal now the objective you might have much smaller behaviors that go with that, but the goal here is, I want to quit smoking cigarettes and you smoke them just regular cigarettes not available. okey dokey all right let's move into. Areas of mental health personal enrichment personal growth move into communication skills, with people, maybe there's a mood that you don't really like about yourself. I know you have this label of bipolar you won't hear me use it very often i'm very symptom based if that works great if it doesn't I can start using it more. But i'm going to be looking mostly at a symptom you know what you don't like maybe about some of the the way you're managing your symptoms, so what is a goal, you have."
15968.0,Patient,"shown with depression, a lot, so I need to. also know, I need to work on trauma. I mean that's the most difficult part."
105.0,Provider,"it's okay it's okay I got you I can need to work on trauma that's an actual thing that I can. I can leave that as a goal let's talk about depression, for a second that's an area that's a problem, and so, for the transcriptionist you know, we might say that client has identified quote unquote I have, I want to work on my depression quote unquote I want to work on my trauma. and other problem areas she's identified is tobacco smoking and maintaining her. sobriety from fentanyl. let's talk for a second about the depression. And this may seem like a strange question, but how is depression, a problem."
15968.0,Patient,"I guess it's just the feeling that I don't like. yeah just a feeling and I I isolate a lot and I have a hard time you know, focusing."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you notice it and the isolation and then the brain fog like it's really hard for you to focus when you're in a depression yeah Okay, what about the other spectrum of that. Like to manage. That like."
15968.0,Patient,Sometimes I won't sleep for like days and but it's better it's more of us happy. You know goal oriented like top of the world kind of you know I won't even lay down for. At least two days on day three I start to hallucinate a little bit.
105.0,Provider,"Like just from not sleeping because you're not sleeping now okay So what if we looked at the depression, from this perspective, and again it's got to come from you, but i'm thinking. Do you know the early signs that a depression is coming."
15968.0,Patient,"No, I thought about it before and I feel like I feel like a it's me like kind of out of nowhere and i'll fill it just like kind of wash over we just like oh shit you know."
105.0,Provider,"Is it still that same phenomenon when you've been consistently taking medication. yeah Okay, so it moves its course, regardless of. circumstance. And regardless of the medication is that right."
15968.0,Patient,"Well, so I kind of you know how the history or a pattern of being you know, good for a while and then. You know, on either management or it'll be a while before you figure it out and then i'll be good for a while and then I need to make adjustments and when I say a while I mean like yours, you know. So, but when it hits me it's really hard and I don't get a lot of breaks in between."
105.0,Provider,"What are you what am I seeing now i'm eating you Ashley I don't know anything about you, I have no baseline idea, what do you feel most of the time most days. last few weeks. You are managing to get to work have there been missed work days. No, no, have you been late."
15968.0,Patient,"No, but I don't have like a strict. Like tardiness policy."
105.0,Provider,"hmm Okay, have you your own standard, have you been changing since this depressions been here. showing up to work."
15968.0,Patient,"It no i'm I am able to like function, we will try to what I have to do. But like this, like this last weekend I always mostly like in bed for last weekend today just."
105.0,Provider,"And what's your relationship with oops and lost you say something to make sure I can hear you Coco Coco can you hear me test test. Something happened in the audio if you can hear me oh there we go good nice correction, do you do you do anything else we you can change your story, by the way, are you self injuring are you bingeing do you, what do you do to while you're in. bed all weekend, what would, what are you doing. sleeping sleeping yeah, how do you sleep so many hours, how do you accomplish that."
15968.0,Patient,"I have no idea. What rises me sometimes like Saturday I slept at least 910 hours at night, and then I took a five hour. Okay, like and it's it's. You know I need to be up and going, and I, you know my aunt and uncle need help around the House."
105.0,Provider,"Right do laundry room and stuff like that, like."
15968.0,Patient,"But I just can't I just so tired, like all I honestly."

15968.0,Patient,And we don't feel tired right now.
105.0,Provider,"No okay all right. Okay, so going back to the goal, I want to work on my depression. In the work that you've done, you know you did about a year's worth at least, from what I can tell um could you share a little bit with me i'm going to close this and turn attention on hundred percent to you now, this is getting put down. What kind of work, did you guys do because it's all different so."
15968.0,Patient,"So we mostly did work on anxiety, so I was having like a lot of issues with anxiety at that point in my life right and she did a good job, where we just pretty much to talk therapy and. You know, I was able to get over it, and just the anxiety and just kind of you know, I was able to function, you know, without that."
105.0,Provider,"What are the skills, you now have that you didn't have before."
15968.0,Patient,"mean. Just kind of I guess working on like mindfulness heels like grounding myself, you know. Working on like self talk, because I have, and I still I didn't haven't gone over this yet, but just the negative self talk that goes on in my head."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, is that connected to depression, yes, so maybe. we're talking earlier about goals for example Member I was using my phone was like. decrease see how we can get Ahold of something to kind of just one little task might be able to watch together. a decrease in negative self talk, we might be able to watch an increase of thought stopping positive reframing we might be able to watch those things change over time, is that something you would want to do."
15968.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Can I hear what you say, to yourself, as recent as this weekend."
15968.0,Patient,"No worries, just like stupid or worthless."
105.0,Provider,"lost cause. Okay. And you mentioned also. I need to work on my trauma you mentioned. I wasn't abused by my father. But there was physical like there was corporal punishment. But you don't see it as abuse, when you say trauma, what are we, what are you talking about I just did a bio psychosocial did I not ask a question."
15968.0,Patient,"Well it's kind of like some things that happened over the last like well, I was in Arizona for five years, but it was the last two years, like a whole bunch of stuff happened. Over the course of two years and I. You know, like I can't remember I put it on the intake paperwork, but. You know so and then just saw like you know, drug addiction and you know, I was going heavy there. You know, and every time right relapsed and detox there was like. I got into a three car accidents in."
105.0,Provider,"And this this assessment doesn't really pick up on those things i'm glad you're sharing that with me it's important, you know that I know that. You know so things like a traumatic brain injury. Maybe didn't suffer traumatic brain injury, but you were you've been in three car accidents this event of. The passing of your boyfriend what. How many years ago, is this the suicide."
15968.0,Patient,So it was in.
