11480.0,Patient,it's okay.
324.0,Provider,hi i'm a little I.
11480.0,Patient,"Know it's all good, I just have in the past, like month i've had so much trouble um when I like go to check in with the care navigator clinic and then they send me to the meeting. Like the past three or four times with my therapist Ashley. she's like oh I didn't even she's like yeah i've been here i've been waiting I didn't even see that you're in the room, and so I was just like I don't know if that happened again I was like I just. A little bit and I don't want to miss it so."
324.0,Provider,Now you're using what I what I do is if i'm running a little behind i'll send a message to the waiting room Dolly be there in the slick. And walking around like all no.
11480.0,Patient,it's okay.
324.0,Provider,you're lacking here because I just sent them a message I think real here she comes back to back. How are you.
11480.0,Patient,"i'm pretty good. very busy with working. Oh, but I like it it's fun. yeah. And then medication wise I got the refill that you sent in appreciate that. Oh yeah. I still don't really notice a difference, but the abuse for. My mom kind of wants me to not take it if I don't notice a difference, but I obviously don't want to just like stop without like talking. To someone about it. yeah I don't know I don't really notice it. Making a positive or negative difference, so I mean good that's good could be worse could be a very negative, but none of that so."
324.0,Provider,Tell me how your how has your anxiety lately i'm scale of one to 10 where does it tend to fall.
11480.0,Patient,"i'm. Why. i'm so complicated when i'm busy I. My brain kind of goes into survival mode. And i'm all like pick and choose. So if all like let's say something in my life happens i'm upset whatever if I have work. I can't my brain is like you can't be upset you have work right now, you don't have time and then my brain is like survival mode I don't have time. So i'm like in a sense, i'm not anxious because I keep telling myself I don't have time for it so that's kind of the way i'm avoiding panic attacks. But then when I like sit down in my therapy sessions ashley's like so how's this and i'm like ah, and then I cry. So I don't know um. yeah I my brain does thinks my brain thinks that I don't have time for it, but I do like I have. Like obviously I have moments of rest."
324.0,Provider,And I know that. But have you heard any panic attack point.
11480.0,Patient,"not really like a couple. Thankfully they've just been on days that I don't have work. yeah it's more like i'll start crying for like 30 seconds and then i'll be like, I have to stop because I have work and I don't want them to be like what's wrong. I don't like it when people ask me what's wrong because I feel like. i'm very independent I would have been and I always feel like I can handle my issues by myself and most of the time I can. But i'm getting better at like asking for help and stuff. yeah. yeah I don't I don't have a lot of panic attacks in the past, like. i'd say few weeks like three or four. yeah i've just been very busy so Oh, and then I learned how to ride a bike. um and it's therapeutic I didn't know that, but when I like ride my bike to work i'm like Oh, this is nice so that's good."
324.0,Provider,"Progress weaken, are you still taking."
11480.0,Patient,"Yes, oh my appetite is a little better. um it's still not like 100%. But for the most part i'm eating multiple times a day which is good at least two times usually three though and that's pretty good. yeah I remember you telling me to watch if i'm like overeating or anything I don't think i'm doing that. I don't really weigh myself I just go I always I never have really I just go based off of if my clothes fit me. Everything seems pretty good. yeah."
324.0,Provider,So i'm sleeping through the night.
11480.0,Patient,"i'm sleeping so much better. that's very helpful I Oh, and then I take magnesium at night. Also because I remember before I was like sometimes taking it not always taking it now i'm in a habit of it. I think it's helping to know but yeah I sleep pretty good now i'm sleeping seven eight hours, which for me is like unheard of i've never done that so that's really awesome I have tons of energy."
324.0,Provider,notice the difference.
11480.0,Patient,"I was sleeping yeah would be sleeping. Oh yeah because before she actually told me, the other day she was like I don't know if it's because you're working so much because, like before I have this job. I like literally wasn't doing anything I would just sleep all the time i'm all during the day, not at night. But yeah my mom told me, the other day she goes I don't know if it's because you're working or if it's because you're like actually sleeping now but um my parents have always gone to bed late and so usually I would go to bed after them, which was already very late. i'm going to bed like before them and my mom is telling me she'll be like yeah whenever I come upstairs I used to see your light on. And she's like oh man she's going to be up all night and she's like, but now, when I come up and I like see your light off and I like peeking and you're like out she's like I feel so happy and i'm like oh yeah. I have more energy I don't get headaches as much. yeah that's good. yeah even my mom says that she she said she asked me if I was less anxious, the other day she goes she also has a new job so she's not really like around me a ton. um so she was just like hey how are you know, I was like Oh, I think i'm good kind of like I told you my brain and i'm not doing it on purpose, because I know that I have time to have emotions. Because like. i'm not a robot it's just not it's not you know so it's not ethical for my brain to be like no emotions we don't have time, so no I i'm not doing it on purpose, I think it's just like. Coping mechanism my brain has found. But i'm trying to when I have time to like sit down oh today i'm off it early or today, I have a day off then i'll be like okay i'll like journal, and like figure out what i'm upset about and then yeah. hey take it from there."
324.0,Provider,"It sounds too, when you say you're you tell your brain. It could like to is that. Those that toolbox toolbox of coping skills and it seems to me like you're using those coping skills."
11480.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
324.0,Provider,"yeah, but I also don't want you to you know, like you say your emotions high or barrier emotions and. Because you don't want to get to a point where you're not showing any emotion and you're trying to. Quote covered him or suffocate them out because you do still you know if something's going on, you feel like you need to let it out and like you say 30 seconds have a little cry to get it out and then do that."
11480.0,Patient,"yeah. And then, what a lot to. feel oh yeah and i'm just i'm trying to remind myself that because I think I know I haven't like forgotten that, but I think that my brain has so I tried to like in the moment okay write down what's going on and then later when I have time come back and assess it so that i'm still. Get like getting everything out. feeling my emotions because yeah I think you're right I think it's not good to. Like hide emotions or bury them, because I do have a tendency of doing that so since I notice it i'm trying not. it's pretty good it's not bad."
324.0,Provider,I like to say you write them down and we go back and look over in in boxes.
11480.0,Patient,And it's definitely very helpful. To do that.
324.0,Provider,"So let's see the beauty bar. If you don't think is helping them. Less. taper down. And then, what I want you to do is we're going to come down on it. But I want you to still keep doing what you're doing you're doing everything. Right. And if you notice a change, you know and your anxiety, or you feel like the panic is coming back. You know, then keep a journal what's going on the could be this helping you don't realize it open."
11480.0,Patient,"yeah I was also thinking that it could it very much because I know you said um I wouldn't necessarily notice like oh wow this is huge difference, but over time, oh Okay, looking back, I am less panicky so you could be right, it could be helping and I don't know so yeah. slides up to you."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's see for today and to for the next three days. To. Do you have any files or tam well."

11480.0,Patient,"It is. I had no idea how bad it was until I fixed it until I was able to sleep, then I was like now, because now, I have no idea how I did anything.
