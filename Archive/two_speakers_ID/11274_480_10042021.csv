ID,Role,Message
480.0,Provider,Good how are you.
11274.0,Patient,"pick your great smile hi. I was really looking forward to chatting with you, so I was. I was looking forward to it, too, I was really sad when I did not make it to my last meeting."
480.0,Provider,I know well that wasn't you that was me. I was sick last week number.
11274.0,Patient,"Can they call you, but I was I missed one like right before that."
480.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
11274.0,Patient,"I remember the things that I don't do right, not the things that other people don't."
480.0,Provider,"Right yeah see I was sick last week you get a pass it was my bad. So what's new what's been going on okay so first off, I do have to say, like two Fridays ago when chantelle brought up the whole coven article with anxiety and obesity and it triggered you."
11274.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm apologizing on behalf of her, because that is something that clinically speaking, we know BMI is not an indicator of health. Obesity is not something that is always. In someone's control, and so I did go ahead and talk to her supervisor about that incident and it's being addressed. One because I don't think that was appropriate at all so i'm apologizing on behalf I mean."
11274.0,Patient,I had to say something.
480.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
11274.0,Patient,"I mean like I said it in a way, but also like."
480.0,Provider,"know it during before you said anything in my head, I was like oh no oh no stop talking, oh no. So I apologize. That happened."
11274.0,Patient,it's you know what it was like. So I wrote a thing about it right.
480.0,Provider,Did you.
11274.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Because that was like and I said something because. I That was the third or fourth thing in like 10 days. About. Obesity about. It it was like alright, so what bothered me. It didn't bother me so much that she said anything because obesity exists. And I am obesity should be a thing that we don't talk about because it exists right. and it's real. and But there's."
480.0,Provider,layered and it's not always in someone's control is the issue I have.
11274.0,Patient,"Well that's part of it, when I have a problem with is when somebody talks in general about obesity. And it happens so much like around and to me, and I know it happens to everybody, or people forget that i'm obese because that's one of the funny things about my fatness is people forget how fat I am. Because of my personality."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and to be fair on zoom you, you do not look like someone who is obese."
11274.0,Patient,Right it's super funny so like I used to do a lot of public speaking and I used to do a lot of on stage stuff. and i'm pretty great on stage.
480.0,Provider,"I can I, yes, I can imagine. Under percent."
11274.0,Patient,"And so I used to. be the executive managing director of a women's business group and I spent Stage three times a month, and it was this whole thing, and it was awesome and destructive because that it fed, all the shadow parts of my ego. and Like I was one of the top people in the organization another one of the top people in the organization was an and not my former person, but it's. Oh there's many people I have. Five hands in my life. And then. After so I did this stuff on stage, my friend, the managing director and did this stuff on stage and afterwards, like it. Like we met up for coffee like a year after like we'd only ever seen each other in our element, and this is the first time we're showing up as people who weren't going to be on states we didn't bring all that extra energy had coffee and she stared at me. And i'm like Oh, am I fatter than you expected a close. she's like yes i'm like oh you're so much shorter and i'm like and i'm like Oh, I know i'm fatter in real life and i'm a person, because people don't think my personality and charisma can be connected to obesity and that's freaking weird. And it hurts, and you are so much shorter in real life than you are on stage because of her charisma she's like seven feet tall on."
480.0,Provider,Stage oh yeah.
11274.0,Patient,And she's I didn't realize. Like that she was five too. But she's just so funny because it's like is it when somebody is attractive and turning on stage that we. Are assume those positive qualities of attraction toward them.
480.0,Provider,"Right, like the conventionally hot. Right holidays yeah. yeah. that's so interesting."
11274.0,Patient,"it's i'm fascinated with it like like the whole like because what keeps happening is and she said something similar could all make an obesity thing I mean city joke, or something because they're funny. When I say them. Several when they're not when other people say. But she said something like you're not obese and then she said that she was fat. And i'm like okay obesity is a mathematical thing not a moral thing."
480.0,Provider,Right.
11274.0,Patient,"We are all subjects to mathematical. Right things you know just maybe different categories, but we are all can be mathematically qualified quantified and and all that stuff you know. And so that was like one of the four experiences that I had in 10 days, where somebody told me I wasn't fat and I got mad yeah i'm like don't like it's like people saying you're not fat because you're pretty. yeah they're not opposites."
480.0,Provider,"they're not well and that's The thing is, you can have both things be true, at the same time, like you can be fat and gorgeous."
11274.0,Patient,or anything or.
480.0,Provider,"Exactly and that's something that they feel like. Like you were talking about the two don't get associated often it's like fat can't go with a positive quality, which is so untrue. and"
11274.0,Patient,"yeah and what you guys didn't see is that the younger woman. I think, with the kids who lives in Richmond cuz like two towns over from me. She is I mean me going you're not fat you're pretty you're like. Oh, my God, like my privates started blowing up like. And when people say you're not fat you're pretty i'm just like. Can you hear the bias coming out to face."
480.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
11274.0,Patient,"That has men. You know. I understand mental conditioning, I understand programming, I understand you know brainwashing. So it's like we're all fucking brainwashed in this culture and I get it and i'm brainwashed against myself yeah and you know."
480.0,Provider,"So, what was the piece of writing you did like what was the."
11274.0,Patient,"Oh, I did this huge Facebook rant about. um I don't only read it to you."
480.0,Provider,yeah I totally do.
11274.0,Patient,You find it I can't be.
480.0,Provider,friends with my clients I would be so happy.
11274.0,Patient,If what.
480.0,Provider,If I could be Facebook friends with my clients I would. So read me whatever anytime.
11274.0,Patient,"Still quick search on obese. Because, then you can see our pictures of my dog. Okay, I said, dear fat people and people who used to be fat. And i've now been told four times in the last 10 days or so that i'm not fat and i'm having all the feelings about it. Because I am is a true statement of my body composition and I don't get angry people tell me that i'm not Oh, and I do get angry when people tell me that i'm not something that I actively am. Because the word fat is synonymous with unlovable repulsive and many bad states, when I say that i'm fat, I think you will hear me saying all of a sudden, all the synonymous things about me and i'm not, for example. Oh. No, I totally read about her specifically that's funny."
480.0,Provider,Good.
11274.0,Patient,Do it for example and huh.
480.0,Provider,yeah good I can't wait to hear it.
11274.0,Patient,"For example, in a meeting I was just in they were saying that people with obesity, have a harder time recovering from coven and the non-obese that isn't beer empirically and objectively true. But then she told me I wasn't fat I told her that I was I don't want to keep fighting with people over my body and I don't want to be misrepresented. Sometimes I get told that i'm not fat and beautiful, first of all those aren't opposites i'm both I don't like the word curvy yes, I have curves but come on. And don't come at me with any of that fluffy nonsense, I believe the way to face a problem is head on, I want people to know that what you think. I want to know what people think about the word, what do you feel when people talk about it, there are health risks and understand them, but if somebody. If someone says that I have a fat body i'm not surprised I live in this body happened it's fine, then it happened again and I was a little less fine before times in 10 days it's not okay. talk to me fat people informally fat people does this really how does this happen to you, it feels like gaslighting that I have to fight for my reality. I think we've been taught that it's rude and taboo to say that someone is fat and it can be said in so many crappy ways that feel very bad, but when we're talking about health and numbers I don't want to sugarcoat it."
480.0,Provider,that's a joke.
11274.0,Patient,"it's it's like I don't it's like I have to wait. For the information about my body, but before I can receive the information about my body, I have to watch the person do social contortion isn't yet."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, and you were right on when he said it feels like gaslighting because that's I can. I can so see that how it's like somebody trying to question your own reality."
11274.0,Patient,"And for me that's triggering. yeah because i've had my reality. aggregating strategically, you know mess with."
480.0,Provider,So somebody's calling you fat isn't triggering somebody saying no you're not fat is what's triggering.
11274.0,Patient,"I mean if somebody walked up to me and was like hey fatty i'd be like oh wow that's rude. Right, you know i'd be like while you're a deck not like ah my fragile ego was crushed yeah you can see things. yeah and then you have no filter apparently but that's i'm not it's like being offended because somebody has blue eyes. They are blue. Right now. Why you've decided to walk across the room and comment about my body is a different situation. But your observation is correct. But what's your motivation and that's that's where I normally go."
480.0,Provider,Right so did you get many responses on that post. yeah.
11274.0,Patient,"yeah i've got you know, and I put informally fat people because it's super like. I was 265 pounds and then I lost. a ton of weight um 2007 2008. A lot of times that's 2000 pounds, but now lost 85 pounds in 18 months. Which is five pounds a month, which is pretty great right."
480.0,Provider,that's really great.
11274.0,Patient,"And I felt bad ass I felt strong and I felt good I stopped losing weight because. After 85 pounds I needed a break, like my body was like it's too much like just chill for a while. And then restart. and Instead I didn't. restart instead I ended up. Like. breaking up with sandy and leaving my business and like. One thing led to another, and now i'm back here at 345 pounds and I hate it i'm not comfortable. People like oh yeah but you feel good i'm like oh no I feel like fucking garbage away 245 pounds. No amount of hashtag body positivity is gonna make me feel good. You know."
480.0,Provider,"So do you read much about the concept of health at any size anyway, like that whole movement because that's more. I don't like the whole body body positivity movement because hey I think it's unrealistic right, nobody is positive about their own body all the time."
11274.0,Patient,"Not even you, people who look like society's recipe for. appearance success."
480.0,Provider,"Especially. Those people, I feel I don't know I feel Okay, because there's a lot of dysmorphia that comes along with any sort of time we're talking about body image right so like, for example, a bit. In part of my journey to self love self realization it healed a lot of the body dysmorphia because. All of the trauma I was holding made me see myself in an unrealistic way right so like when I used to look in the mirror one of my biggest insecurities has always been my nose, because I have a big bump on my nose and it's fairly large given you know standard size noses. So I was always so insecure about my nose and i'm not kidding when I tell you, five years ago if I look in the mirror my nose would look three times the size, it does now, but that's. Actually, how I saw it that's what I believed was true about myself. And so I think where it gets tricky is sometimes the body dysmorphia correlates to our own internal sense of worth and value and not necessarily just objectively about your body, because when I started to heal that stuff, then I could see myself. More in a realistic way and be like you know what my nose isn't that bad it kind of fits my face I don't need to get a nose job for life to be perfect, you know what I mean. So it's like little things like that I see in my best friend is a perfect example she is gorgeous stunning, like every feature is perfect. Ideally, what I would want on my face yet she continuously gets lip injection she wants cheek injection she wants to get her chin like saw down and smaller and it's like me listening to that is heartbreaking because she is someone that I would kill to have her face and body. And she's so unhappy and that's why I tried to talk to her about the fact that it has nothing to do with your face, because if you do all of this work. you're still going to feel the same way you feel because it's not about your facial features it's about your internal struggles and not feeling enough and not feeling worthy so that's where I think. In a sense, everybody struggles with body image because it's such a representation of our internal states."
11274.0,Patient,Have you seen the documentary killing a softly.
480.0,Provider,i'm really bad about remembering movies.
11274.0,Patient,"You should watch it. Even. If he might not it out and it's a by. I think she's a professor right now she's on killing us softly for because she's made so many and she talks about and analyzes her name is Jean je N, but on her last name. She talks about basically. The the the relationship between advertising and women in the media and self image. and it's really engaging and really interesting and. i'm thinking i'm looking forward to watching it with my niece. yeah because she's 11 she's gorgeous and she was telling me about her crow's feet."
480.0,Provider,Oh no at 11.
11274.0,Patient,"yeah and she's like because she came out with like. an inch thick of concealer on her eyes. Are not note becky eyes, she says she's baggy under icicles because she has concealer so now she's trying to find things to conceal and all the makeup tutorials need to really go so for this part under your I hear you do this, and she doesn't have any. coloration change there. Right and then she's like and i'm like you don't have that you know that's not the thing for you, but. she's like oh no, but I have i'm like show me in the mirror she's like. Well, when I go like this and i'm like oh yeah when you hold your. Baby that's a shadow. It was like what and i'm like now put your face towards the light, where are they now has your face changed it's changed angle yep in relation to the light she's like oh my God yeah. And i'm like just because there's a product doesn't mean you have a problem. Exactly and i'm like and and and people with products to sell will make you feel like me the best example, I think, is when listerine was making dishes."
480.0,Provider,"I mean, I do not remember that at all."
11274.0,Patient,um it's like the 1920s um So the first yeah yeah poison after up your hoo ha. wow because disgusting lady smell like. and feminine odor is a thing my nephew's terrified of. he's 12 it's not his fault.
480.0,Provider,Why is it mother in law.
11274.0,Patient,"No, no it's um. He was. In appropriately sexualized by his mom's boyfriend."
480.0,Provider,Oh that's right.
11274.0,Patient,"Her mom's his mom's boyfriend is pretty obsessed with. odor waivers and smells. I mean, he would talk about he would explain what it was like going down on my on his mom he would tell the. Child oh eight, so this is what oral sex is, and this is what your mom tastes like."
480.0,Provider,Oh that's so bad.
11274.0,Patient,"yeah and so he has a fixation with it because information was handled poorly. yeah like I remember after it happened and he's like I don't eat he was so little when this happened and. i've got a very small house, and so I have a kitchen and then there's this weird dining room part of the living room right."
480.0,Provider,So guy.
11274.0,Patient,"In there, and so I was the kids and my husband my husband uncle ethan we're sitting at the table and little ethan and I. were sitting on the couch we were all talking because we're in the same room and I remember, I was sitting on the couch looking at big ethan my husband and we're talking and. I turned and ethan, who is sitting next to me was smelling my crotch."
480.0,Provider,don't mean to laugh but.
11274.0,Patient,But oh.
480.0,Provider,whoa whoa.
11274.0,Patient,"And i'm really glad I knew about the situation with his mom before that, because i'm like he's doing science."
480.0,Provider,yeah it's a science experiment he wants to now.
11274.0,Patient,"He is. And I remember, being a little bit fixated on my mom's aroma when I was a kid like there were times when she was evident."
480.0,Provider,yeah I mean it's hard to not notice if it's pretty evident.
11274.0,Patient,yeah or like i'd have my head on her lap or something.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
11274.0,Patient,"So I remember taking note of that, as a kid so I I was just like Okay, but bodies or you know, whatever. But yeah i'm like I remember, I was close looking this way, and then I looked back this way and I looked down and there was a childhood in my crotch sniffing I was like. Oh, my God, this is so awful so so here, I am going to generally not traumatized this child would tell him to get his head out of my frickin Raj. Right."
480.0,Provider,"In a noisy thought sniff down there, please. Please, what did you say to me."
11274.0,Patient,"I don't remember I don't remember, because I was kind of like ah. yeah I was super kind of freaked out because that's just you just don't expect an eight year old they're like. He wasn't touching he was just you know. wow. it's like so much of like raising children. is like holding the cringe inside."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I see the right thing on the outside oh yeah. Oh yeah."
11274.0,Patient,Like oh God oh God oh God don't sit outside in the world. But.
480.0,Provider,And kids are just so i'm filter.
11274.0,Patient,it's a beautiful thing but heard an honest and raw.
480.0,Provider,it's yeah I was just gonna say it's terrifying and also magical at the same time.
11274.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and abby the 11 year old girl, you know with the crow's feet and you know wrinkles and this haggard little chivenor skinny."
480.0,Provider,You have to tell her that wearing makeup is gonna give her all those things she's afraid of.
11274.0,Patient,"told her what i've been trying with her is that there's a difference between beauty and glamour. And what i've been trying to say is that makeup is glamour. Yes, glamour is fun, but beauty is you."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, I love that."
11274.0,Patient,"Beauty is them and sometimes boys want to wear glamorous and I brought one of our glamour and glamour is fun and exciting. But glamour isn't really every day right and so i'm trying to like. yeah you know because, like. I. I find myself having to be politically fat and politically queer for people. Does that make sense."
480.0,Provider,"So I think I know what you're trying to say with that, but explain how you mean it. Like you have to protect other fat people and other queer people is that, where you're meeting."
11274.0,Patient,"And that's part of it i'm i'm. i'm as ethan would say that's true but partial um. it's like. point out. The bullshit. and point out. The toxic systems at work. And it's just a lot of work like like my mother in law ethan's mom is so fat phobic like shockingly fat phobic and I get a lot from her because she likes me and she loves me and. She has done with me and. Like it's taken her a while to be like okay with me being on a dance floor at a party. You know, with my fat body bustin moves and, like the amount of. My if there's advanced where i'm going to. dance and I don't i'm not dancing for you and my dance is not about you it's about my body and music and it's time to dance like yeah. A couple. Months ago I guess now she went to this music in the park thing, and I will thankfully she's in Oklahoma now because she always loves drunk she was two those two things were drunk boomers are."
480.0,Provider,And that's the that's the crowd that is triggering for all of us.
11274.0,Patient,Sure they're worse when they're in a group and drunk roof i'm like holy crap. That was when you know and then i'm in my then i'm an obese person in my son year dancing because Fuck the world. It was good music. and That was when a guy like came up to me and he's like are you on the best singer.
480.0,Provider,"And Oh, I remember that."
11274.0,Patient,yeah and. Like it was really hard for her that I was like. I don't know i'm not good at being a. i'm not a visibly disabled person in a way that she would prefer.
480.0,Provider,"But. My guess is, if you were that, in a way she'd prefer she'd still have other issues, because this is clearly her issue not you."
11274.0,Patient,Exactly yeah.
480.0,Provider,So did you guys end up going out because she was here a couple weekends ago right did you end up going out with her again. With Danny.
11274.0,Patient,"In progress where it was hung over. yeah she's. she's a lot of fun. I mean she's. she's a lot of problems but she's a lot of fun and she is my favorite mother in law, so far, I think the first the first one was terrible. And I was. i'll say maladjusted. I was pretty terrible to yeah. And then the second one was. Just real drunk. And so that's what I did with her too. And sandy didn't really care because. I could be hilarious and drinking with her mom and then sandy would just be like just hanging out and. she's like I can watch the susie show and it's in a you'll walk up my mom and then she won't give me shit so it was fine with her."
480.0,Provider,Is that when you're drinking got really bad when you were with sandy. Because you've been through phases right with alcohol.
11274.0,Patient,yeah um no my drinking was always really bad and then it got less bad with ethan.
480.0,Provider,"got it. When you were super hung over did it trigger anything like did you feel guilty, did you feel like oh I shouldn't have done that."
11274.0,Patient,"I always feel bad yeah. Like for breathing so. I mean I am so wired for guilt and shame constantly. yeah So yes, and I know that there's a physiological component of that but. yeah I always feel really. Terrible like last night I went to my friend of mine his birthday 50th birthday party oh my God. we're turning into actual grownups and. inch you know I had one drink last night, and I was like so proud of myself for like having one and stopping. yeah it's not really my style."
480.0,Provider,I can't relate at all just kidding what I used to say one drink would just pissed me off wasn't worth it.
11274.0,Patient,it's funny yeah I. it's rhythmic. it's like. I don't know like I could just get into a rhythm and like 10 drinks later i'm like in a bad way.

So we would go. camping and it was pretty fun, except for the abuse, but i'm. We would go, we would rent out like a whole campground and then it would be, it was pretty great everybody in the campground with somebody new. And that was really fun and all the kids would bring their bikes and there was like. There was a loop in the middle of the camping and that was like it was like nascar just like a group of spinning wheels, and it was it was really fun, except for when it was terrible. and That is called the day the babies to go but take a Bay is famous for two movies, one is return of the jedi because that's where the database system is and. And all the Redwood forest where they had the fights and everything and then the other one is because that's where the birds, was shot Alfred hitchcock the birds.

480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's why there has to be a balance, like. get to a point where you're not physically uncomfortable but then stop there, which is the hard part for a lot of people right when you're you start losing weight, then you just want to keep going and going and going. So with you, we know that there has to be a happy medium, you have to be physically comfortable and. able to. Sit to where you're not feeling that pressure, but then also like you said being. skinny is triggering for you tip."
11274.0,Patient,"Being. Being on people's menu against my will, is triggering and I understand that at different sizes I fit on different people's menus yeah and the thinner I am the more menus I seem to be on right and that makes me feel unsafe."
480.0,Provider,Do you feel like it's possible to remove yourself from the menus regardless of your size. emotional boundary you.
11274.0,Patient,"it's not about I mean it's it's just. Like. I was at a bar and I was talking about. I was speaking very sexually explicitly because I wasn't. Okay, so used to work at a bordello type situation. I was not a sex worker. I was the personal assistant to the Madam."
480.0,Provider,Oh that's kind of fun.

480.0,Provider,Oh yeah oh yeah. it's those that don't make sense really do break your brain.
11274.0,Patient,"And so. I. was really a session with sex workers in a way of just I don't know they're in the Bible. There in the world, when I was getting excommunicated guys did up and prophesied that I would be selling my ass on the street within six months, and like i've just always been compared to sex workers and I considered it. i've had several friends who did that kind of work and so i've been kind of a it's been offered to me as an employment option on a few occasions. And I never took it. But there was a fixation and so, when I was living in and I never tell anybody this when I was working in oakland I became the PA. For an escort who owned a. massage place. And so I mean I would do her grocery shopping I would you know and then bring it back to the place. And like I would make sure her dog got. A ridiculous amount of supplements, and I would make sure. hey you know the bills are paid, and I would just. You know. Like oh location to is running out of lube go get another bucket because we had five gallon buckets a loop."

It would be really funny because they even come pick me up from work and there was this girl Raven who would always like me get him and i'm like Okay, because I don't care if the. right thing, my dude. Right how about it it's fun everybody should."
480.0,Provider,love that perspective I love it so much.
11274.0,Patient,"Even though mine he's with me he's not for me, you know. So, like. You know the barrier is a special place with morality, sometimes i'm sure Florida is too. Oh yeah I worked at this bordello esque thing in oakland for a while and I was making 1600 a weekend cash."
480.0,Provider,For a personal assistant or for doing extra stuff.

11274.0,Patient,"yeah but like. The crazy hyper sexuality, but not doing it. yeah and. It was an interesting environment has been toxic, it was a bit bonkers, but a lot of these women, I had so much in common. With you know and yeah I don't know, it was my way of. Being there being in it, learning about it researching but not like committing not put my toe in."

480.0,Provider,"Okay, so you started talking about that, when we were talking about the being on people's menus."
11274.0,Patient,"yeah they tried to get me to work because I was a definite fetish category. That could get work. Being smaller. makes me feel unsafe but but, like, I want to try again i'm just trying to get the motivation it's like i'm so exhausted all of the time and part of that is the way part of it is. All the extra work my blood has to do to get around my body and part of that is the trauma and I don't know what's what, but I do know that this is one of the elements like if I. shauntel thankfully. To me a referral to get genetic testing. My mom has it just it out super weird genetic disorder."
480.0,Provider,Oh okay.

480.0,Provider,"It wouldn't make sense, because i'm irrationally afraid of the dentist it always hurts so bad, so that would make sense."
11274.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's a thing it's weird. um but I was talking to Dennis and she's like well. and makes me brother has its jaw thing and i'm like Oh, can you see evidence of anything because I don't know and she's just go get genetic tests that I might go oh sure yeah that's too easy. So I was like talking to some time i'm like oh so this doctors like we'll just go through genetic testing this sucker like just go in and like and this keeps happening and be like Oh, you might need to get a genetic tests i'm like.

11274.0,Patient,"Trying to remember. I think I mean. I don't remember if I told you anything I would just be trying to fill in a space that I don't remember, but not with factual information."
480.0,Provider,"How does that make you feel, though, when she said that."
11274.0,Patient,What is that feeling. I really It made me feel I really. yeah i'm just because. I don't want to be anybody's medical mystery it's one of my life.
480.0,Provider,"Well that's why I asked that because, like, I can imagine if I heard that from a doctor, it would make me feel like oh great i'm too much of a problem you can't even deal with me like that kind of. feeling."
11274.0,Patient,"yeah no I it's a common feeling where with like you know mental health stuff it's like oh I don't have any experience with that or Oh, you know, like my first therapist you know in 1995 you know, like she was like. super weird out about my bisexuality like. super freaked out about my chick telemedia. Like she'd never heard of it, or like whatever, and so it was like she's like Oh, I do all this stuff and get back to you and then she sent me a pamphlet that says swear to God it said it's called trichotillomania you're not crazy i'm like Oh, I can be two things."
480.0,Provider,can be two things.

11274.0,Patient,"So. Okay, so i'm tired of being special case."
480.0,Provider,"you're not a special case I mean you are because you're uniquely yourself in that way you're a special case but you're not a special case, some people are just not experienced with stuff in life."
11274.0,Patient,feel very frequently the statistical outlier and situations.
480.0,Provider,"Yes. That could be true, and that doesn't mean you're special case, it means you've had a lot of life experience that some people are either scared by. It makes them feel because that's The other thing you have to remember is none of it's about you it's about how. They feel. Right so so many."
11274.0,Patient,everything's about me.
480.0,Provider,"everything's about you, which is the problem that we're trying to address. let's externalize some of that, because if, like let's say I tell you I don't feel equipped to handle your case. How is that about you that's about my own insecurities my anxieties thinking that oh no I can't handle this i'm not experienced enough."
11274.0,Patient,"So, to the person who keeps running into that."
480.0,Provider,"Well yeah and that's where I understand how you feel how you feel at the same time, I think it says a lot more about other people's. insecurities. limits in their own understanding, especially like part of the issue for you is you are so self aware so conscious of all of your dynamic societies dynamics and so. That feels threatening to people that aren't quite as evolved. To I don't think that that is a reflection of you being too much of a problem I think that's more a reflection of them, not being as evolved mentally as you."
11274.0,Patient,I don't want to have cat so.
480.0,Provider,Do you really think you do.
11274.0,Patient,I have no idea.

11274.0,Patient,"Well, for the first time in 10 years I have somebody to call thanks to her yeah now, I have to do it."
480.0,Provider,"And you can push back to and say. scared I think you're a good fit for me because you're the first person in 10 years that has given me a referral to something I need to do. i've had doctors tell me that i'm too much for them and i've said i'm staying with you. Sorry, I have to deal with me."
11274.0,Patient,that's hilarious.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so we only have five minutes and I want to ask what are the things you're going to do this week to help motivate you to get back to like meal planning and the stuff that makes you feel better about your body."
11274.0,Patient,"and doing meal planning, I do obsessive stupid amounts of meal planning."
480.0,Provider,"Do you follow it, though."
11274.0,Patient,That 65%.
480.0,Provider,that's good.
11274.0,Patient,"I gotta see. that's good. 69 is good yeah. it's. um. yeah it's the movement like I just don't want to like moving her. yeah existing in this big of a body. Is exhausting yeah and I understand that, if I can make it smaller I will get more energy and it's like. But you got to spend your energy before you have it. And there's so many other things, taking my energy. i'm just so tired all the time."
480.0,Provider,"yeah and it's hard to find motivation to do something that you don't want to do. Right, even if you know it's going to be helpful i'm sure there's no part of you that wants to go exercise."
11274.0,Patient,"know, especially like. And somebody tomorrow we'll just go for a walk every day in the afternoon i'm Michael sure i'll put on all my fucking son here."
480.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. Are you want to talk. Okay, so I have a really good friend who. struggles with her weight and she started doing the tick tock dances as her exercise because she really likes to dance and it doesn't feel like exercise to her. So she's been posting on instagram like the past month, all these tick tock dances and she's making her girlfriend doing with her two and they're having so much fun with it, and like that to me is, if you can find something active that you enjoy then it doesn't feel like extra. promise just finding whatever that is because it's different for everybody."
11274.0,Patient,And that's dance for me it's always been dance for me it's just.
480.0,Provider,To put on music and shake your booty.
11274.0,Patient,I don't know why. i'm scared I don't know why. I don't know why I have a wall of no I think it's because i'm scared of pain like i'm in so much pain all the time that is like.
480.0,Provider,"And what if you put in all this effort, and your body doesn't change. That could be part of it too."
11274.0,Patient,yeah. it's. just empty energy.
480.0,Provider,"that's okay i'll come when you're ready, but that's The thing is. motivation comes when you're in enough pain right so that's that's the good part and the bad part is takes a lot of pain to motivate us to do something different. So there's a balance, I feel like you're almost at that point of being unhappy enough to want to do something different, but you're not quite there yet."
11274.0,Patient,I feel like that's really true yeah.
480.0,Provider,But that doesn't mean anything about you that's how all humans operate.
11274.0,Patient,"yeah, but I should be better."
480.0,Provider,Why because you're not human you're exempt from human experience.
11274.0,Patient,"That would be cool. That wouldn't be on right. I don't know I just feel like. I should, will myself into. Less pain it it messes with me like feeling like right now, like feeling my gut on my leg it it's a constant thing I remember when I lost weight last time, and that was no longer a feeling like I just sat and I was like."
480.0,Provider,Nice.
11274.0,Patient,there's nothing on my lap just sitting. And then I got sexually assaulted again.
480.0,Provider,"Well, that makes a lot more sense than why you're hesitant. And it really happened again after you lost me. yeah."
11274.0,Patient,wow happened a couple times after last week.
480.0,Provider,"Well, but now you have the sun gear to protect you."

11274.0,Patient,thing so. Making them an invisible forever I love it.
480.0,Provider,Right right wrinkles and sudden gear that'll keep you protected.
11274.0,Patient,"me alone. yeah it's like I need constant attention, but also, I want to be ignored and people just don't get that balance."
480.0,Provider,"Oh. yeah no I get it, I remember a time in my life, I feel like it was high school early college days. It I was so aware of the fact that I wanted to be the Center of attention, I wanted to be unique I wanted to be like the exception to the rule but yeah every time someone treated me like that I hated it so much. And I couldn't figure out where that desire was coming from because i'm like well every time this happens, though. You shut down but it's like this need that I felt I had. To be a Center of attention, and I think it was all about validation because I didn't have any people safe people in my life validating me. As being worthy just for being me so it's like that idea of well if you're the Center of attention and everybody wants, you and your unique and special and all this stuff But then when you actually get the attention you're like oh this feels foreign because you're not used to it. it's a very interesting dynamic and balance for sure."
11274.0,Patient,Be human.
480.0,Provider,So you're working today.
11274.0,Patient,"i'm about to go take a nap. And then go finish sleeping. um and then i'm going to sneak in a couple hours of work i've so I work part time for my job, and so i've started taking Mondays off completely. Because I just keep filling up my time with work and that's not working part time that's working all the time again paid part time that's not cool. And so I am going to sneak in a few hours of work today when nobody knows i'm working so that they're not chatting with me and all the office. stuff because i've got a couple things they need to get done because i'm going to take Thursday off instead because i'm having an organizer come to my house."

Because it's big it's a big."
480.0,Provider,"it's very big. And that way, if you have to move and sell the House you're not going to be scrambling to fix stuff up just."

You own a house in the Bay area. I mean the very North Bay it's hardly considered the bay, but it is real estate wise and she's like that's a really good asset to not let go of."
480.0,Provider,"yeah unless you're desperate for money yeah if you can make. It work with renting it out well and that's The thing is normally if you're renting it out, you end up making more money anyways as long as the House doesn't require a ton of maintenance."
11274.0,Patient,Right and so we're getting it to a point where all of the major maintenance is handled.
480.0,Provider,yeah.

His work room project all kinds of like woodworking and stuff and so we're going to swap rooms and that's what the things organized is helping us with is. Because that room is much, much darker and this room is really bright he's always having to put extra light in his room and i'm always happy to put extra dark in my room and we're like you know what. We get up being dumb. and be smart. Instead, and we're like yet and so she's coming. On Thursday, so i'm taking Thursday, I have to make it take a quick break to do a podcast episode, but like.
