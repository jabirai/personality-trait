705.0,Provider,"Did that feel good to have that in your mind where you know just building your own self confidence with you know what no I don't deserve this and i'm just not going to answer I have, I have that control."
13365.0,Patient,"Yes, I do want it, I remember it because I was so stressed about like everything. And I really wanted to talk about this but, like, I have to change the tire and whatever you know, but I remembered it's so remember that I don't think that I told you so like i'm not in a relationship with anybody so i'm like with. Different guys, you know, like."
705.0,Provider,Like really.
13365.0,Patient,"yeah basically and but i've been talking to him since March and we've been cool about it, and everything and, like, I never had this issue, but again, every time that I would have sex with him, I was drunk or like a you know. And I mean it was OK, but I would like, I feel like sometimes I think to feel like. less tense or I don't know because when i'm sober I like think stuff or you know in this time. When we were having sex I kind of felt like. Not grossed out or anything but I felt like scared. And like feigned imagine him as my uncle you know. Because they both had he had a beer too. And he has beer, so I didn't know I got scared for a little bit. Because I wasn't drunk you know, this time last locations, I was drunk every day, you know. That this vacation I wasn't in that happened."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and I think you to before mercia that that yeah that there had been some events and because of the trauma that sometimes it comes up especially."
13365.0,Patient,"Sorry sorry for it to really do you know why. Why is it coming up now like, if I didn't remember like, why is it coming up yeah."
705.0,Provider,"You know brasil one of the things to that you're telling me is that you're not drinking as much, and so, sometimes to. That when you're drinking is your memory isn't that great and it's almost like it numbs everything out which temporary that can give you relief, but for the long run it doesn't work. And so, by it coming out and these different ways is sometimes the decrease of alcohol or not using alcohol and then also to you're getting help now. And you're you're feeling like okay i'm really thinking about things and reflecting where before you didn't give yourself a chance to so things can start to surface and then, as you just described to you know how you said the same facial features. With with trauma, especially that sometimes things like that can really trigger where it brings you back to those memories that maybe you hadn't thought about in years and trying to connect it all."
13365.0,Patient,"This total daily. photo like, why is it happening, you know, like, if I remember. My whole life Why am I thinking about it know if I don't even I don't even remember I don't even remember you know. I don't even know if they happen."
705.0,Provider,"sounds like to pursue that you're really trying to piece together things that may have happened in the past where it's unclear, because you can't remember as much. And you know a lot of times when you're in group and you're hearing other people talk about their trauma it can trigger that and you too."
13365.0,Patient,Can you repeat that again.
705.0,Provider,"that a lot of times when you're in group, and I know, sometimes we have people that talk about their drama. Excuse me their trauma and it can also if you're in group, you can start to be triggered that way of okay when they're talking about what happened to them, then it makes me think about what happened to me or trying to still piece it together."
13365.0,Patient,"Oh. And you know what i'm. it's weird because everything started. When I used to talk to this girl citing. Give me just one second release because they close at seven, let me see of my cousin can taste really want to talk to you awesome. Thank you for waiting. It looks like we're on teams. Who. will fix it for me."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, really. yeah oh good, you have a spare and everything."
13365.0,Patient,She has it.
705.0,Provider,Okay well i'm glad that worked out for you then.
13365.0,Patient,yeah. My cousin has her lights.
705.0,Provider,She has her lights.
13365.0,Patient,I don't know where it is.
705.0,Provider,Oh you're trying to find where the lights are in the in the room.
13365.0,Patient,"well. it'll be like that, like this, but what was, I told."
705.0,Provider,"You. When when we were talking about people in group and talking about it, and then you said you started talking to some girl."
13365.0,Patient,"Yes. So she was psyche I met her at at AAA where we switch to my coworker. And so we started hanging out, we started drinking and smoking together, you know, like. So. She would smoke and get paranoid. And why I didn't use to get paranoid, but that day I did because of her you know. Everywhere, she she was. She was like it was her her her boyfriend and I. And then they were together and I don't know where she was like. don't touch me don't touch me, you know. and I was like are you Okay, and I was like trying to. come down, you know, like that, with her. And she was not, I thought it was just. at him, you know, but it wasn't me to like she couldn't like the feeling, or whatever like how she was doing. And then come down, whatever the difference, but. It was when I started crying and it was weird because I was feeling like if I was going smaller and smaller she was hugging me and I started crying saying that I feel like I was like it was really bad time for me, and I think like being. Under the effect of alcohol, you know wasn't like good. And I started crying and saying that I haven't done anything for myself with a family, whatever and then she started like saying you've done a lot whatever blah blah blah, and then I started crying and I said that. Well, my uncle did something to me, and then the name of my uncle and then I started crying she was like it's okay like it's not your fault, but the thing is that she was right. She was raped by. Her uncle to and a friend. And they had her for like a whole week. And she was just six years, six years old and like that is so sad I don't know it came to enlighten them a second but I said that my uncle just something to eat. And I was crying like literally having a panic attack it was like one of the worst yeah."
705.0,Provider,"So with that brace versa, you hadn't you hadn't known that before until that moment that you're talking to her that it hadn't come up before."
13365.0,Patient,"yeah and the next day, when I like one like the next day, I was like Why would I even say that, like why. That was like three years ago and. I literally can't stop thinking about it, since time. But I do remember like. playing with other kids and stuff you know, I was like I was too little to be doing those stuff too, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I could see pursue were by her sharing her story that, then you started associating your own story. And that, before it like open that door because before you just suppressed all the feelings because you're like Oh, we don't talk about this, but when she did, then you, it allows you to open up to."
13365.0,Patient,"And then, when I was at evelyn's. But this is the funny thing like. don't get me wrong. I don't feel like when it's bad. And, but that they like we never did edibles before so we did edibles and we took her like a big amount, you know so they're like kind of trippy so we were tripping. And what triggered me was the sound of. Natural firewall pitch like a Mexican show. and The little girl, it was a little girl like. What a great. system, how do you say novella. What a great show to watch, you know."
705.0,Provider,I know what novella.
13365.0,Patient,"Well, well eating a an edible. So it triggered me because the little girl. The uncle was doing something to her and then Evelyn my friend was like haha my uncle rape me or whatever you know she make fun of that or whatever, and then I was. feeling so much fear like I was scared and I started crying and then I started telling her, I was crying and telling her that. When I was little. You know, like why. Why did I say that again why just suffer. don't know."
705.0,Provider,"How are you questioning versa, if this happened or not."
13365.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,i'll cry.
13365.0,Patient,But you know I don't remember anything literally like I don't even get. Images it's just like sometimes the feeling. From not explain it.
705.0,Provider,"Well that's to me mercy is by other people talking about it that, then you feel like that it is possible that something happened to you, and you, you don't have like a clear memory of it."
13365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it can be, because a lot of times, especially if you're younger and you were so young, that you didn't form a lot of memories about it, and then you know later on you're like wait a minute, maybe this was something inappropriate. Like you were talking about to I think with your your cousins was there, like a you know, a time when people were playing you know, sometimes people call it doctor yeah yeah. And that can that can get where then you're questioning was what I was doing was it really you know, under the category of something else happened or was this just being children and experimenting. Do you have any anybody pursued that you know that you during that timeframe like when you're younger like you said, your mom kind of insinuated that something happened."
13365.0,Patient,And don't talk to her lawyer.
705.0,Provider,"Was there a time that you said those sheet, she said, like something that was vague, but you didn't know rather to make something out of what your mom said."
13365.0,Patient,"What was the first word today, he said, sorry."
705.0,Provider,I was just saying with your your mom was there something there was a conversation I thought that the two of you had that you were also questioning of if mom maybe had an indication that something.
13365.0,Patient,"Well, I just told her that, but then she can talk about it."
705.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah that can be you know when you feel comfortable mercia is asking you know a little bit more direct with mom of you know here's what keeps happening to me, is there anything that you know."
13365.0,Patient,"So you think it would be like that to ask it would be better, through the phone and. Then in person, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's up to you mercy of what you feel comfortable with, and if you think you're ready to have that conversation with your mom. Part of sometimes coming in to receive counseling is trying to get to the place to where you've maybe first work on some things and then, when you feel more comfortable you know, then asking family if you feel like. you're ready. And sometimes it takes time to go through it."
13365.0,Patient,"Then, for some reason I keep thinking them, maybe it's just me, making it a. career from."
705.0,Provider,"there's you know to proceed and that's one of the things that at the ED program when you work with your counselors be able to share that some of these things you're trying to piece together. If it really happened or not because I mean you know, sometimes to it is where you are under the influence and maybe you're more easily persuaded that something happened because in that time you're under the influence of the person's under the influence and they're talking about it."
13365.0,Patient,"But still tones evenly um what I mean like I will get more paranoid, but it still happens when i'm sober you know, like the feeling, sometimes. It happens more on like the panic attacks, I think they are worst when when league with the edibles and stuff for sure not during edibles."
705.0,Provider,Are you doing animals anymore.
13365.0,Patient,"No, no, I don't know like I already tried like three times and it. it's I don't know there's strong or just I just don't know how to make."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and while while you're trying to go through this I really you know with something like that it could really bring out where things feel more intense it can really you know, like your experience, where you're like Oh, my goodness what's kind of happening here, why don't you. feel all these ways."
13365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is and it's like. I know you've shared to there's been several different partners were different things have happened, and you stopped when you are, you know, having sexual relations to because you thought that you know it didn't feel right you weren't comfortable."
13365.0,Patient,To say.
705.0,Provider,"that's okay I just I couldn't see you, so I didn't know you kind of there you are."
13365.0,Patient,"it's because it's dark start going to be like right here on the phone, so the light give my face."
705.0,Provider,"Right okay. yeah I know what with this pursuit is do you feel like like right now, sometimes why people are sorting it out to that they will do you know just like you're no longer eating animals is maybe. Not have sex right now, while you're going through this you know just for maybe, if you think that's something that you could do until you find out a little bit more and see how you can feel a little bit safer insecure."
13365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"And some of the stuff that you went through in high school. When you add share to seems like that it either. intensified what you're remembering from when you were younger, but it definitely to that that he was unhealthy and had done some stuff that wasn't appropriate. Is that. Remember, when we had that conversation, and you were you were looking back at some of the stuff and going Oh, now that i'm saying it, this was not right what my my high school boyfriend was doing. yeah. say."
13365.0,Patient,"No i'm like yeah like it was like that, like makes like it was a good deal. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Getting to a place where you can feel safe and secure with someone. And, knowing that you deserve that."
13365.0,Patient,"I wanted to turn on the light, but I couldn't find it. So I had to open the door with it like notion. So you think like. something that happened."
705.0,Provider,"What i'm saying for see it, is that, until you go through this more and talk about it and explore then some of it may become a little bit clear it's hard to know, because, like I said, you know some of it, too, can be if. Someone had already shared their story and you're under the influence you might be more drawn to maybe that happened to me and then that's planted in your head and then, after that, even if you're not using. You still may think that because you were related back to the first time that you talked about it does that makes makes sense when i'm sharing."
13365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so at this stage for see it, I know you want more of a clear like did this happen or not, and right now, you don't have any clear indication like rather it happen or not happen or did not happen. And you're. trying to get to. You know I think for seo what's really good is getting you some coping skills like we've worked on some things where you can do the deep breathing. Working on being more assertive and being able to verbalize what's happening, those are good scope coping skills to have where, then this next part where. You know, you can work with Andrea to go a little bit more into addressing if there was trauma or not. But it's good that, first, that you had these coping skills and that you get more comfortable. Before then maybe you know even talk to your mom and then he wants to talk to your mom seeing if there's anything she can tell you are any of your other family or friends that were around you at that time."
13365.0,Patient,"I have a question of are you going to send, like all my reports to. or."
705.0,Provider,"yeah what's nice procedure where you don't feel like you have to share everything again is she will have access to our notes here. And so, in the note like for today would sit would share that there's you know that you're trying right now to there's questions if there was child childhood trauma. And so, she would be able to take it from there. And that's good for seo but also to the more that you can share with her just you know."
13365.0,Patient,At the end.
705.0,Provider,Of what's going on that's going to be helpful to.
13365.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah, but it is, I know it's sometimes."
13365.0,Patient,"I feel like have. To which, like about the accident over you know, like so many things already my boyfriend. Like they used to call me thrown chipotle like. Like it's a lot, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Because it's with you versus seem like a lot, but to to us our team that's what we're here for and it's best The more that you're willing to be open and honest. The better, it is because then you're like hey I don't have to edit how I feel and what i'm going to say here's what's going on for me and part of it, is it takes time to process things and your mind still focused on Okay, I want, I want to know more, you know about. my childhood and if there was trauma."
13365.0,Patient,"And it's weird because well when I have panic attacks. it's like my fear to die. And I know it, because it's because of the accident, you know. i'm like Why is this happening, maybe something did happen, but again I don't remember anything but I do also remember. like an old man, it was a worker, he was like doing the neighbor's house. or me and another group of little girls would go and play with them, and I remember, he would sit us on his legs, one by one, we will make like a. line. But I don't I remember that I was like no like i'm not gonna do it. Because I knew, you know. What was he trying to do. that's how I remember."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and versa, you had talked about that, I think, even the last session, where is that the connection that you shared you don't even like to have like a coke or any type of water bottle or anything that you would set in between your legs because that's what it reminds you of."
13365.0,Patient,"kind of in a. Little soul. Something that I share. I think, like all the time, I would think like of everything in a sexual way you know, like even when I was sleeping like. With somebody or like. let's say my my my sister or my mom or my dad or brother whatever any like simple touch like I will move, you know, like I would feel like they were trying to teach me or something you know."
705.0,Provider,"versus sometimes when you're younger and if there is sexual trauma that happens to you, is it. can already where you either react, where you you can't even stand being touch this it's very distressing for you. or sometimes people cope with it the other ways is sometimes people will be overtly sexual they'll be over, you know sexual because they go one way or the other, if the trauma and dealing with it, have you have you ever heard of something like that."
13365.0,Patient,"Well, I used to be like really active before it was like. 15 or 16 1617 that those two years. I would be like getting drunk and everything, because I used to hang out with older girls than me and they were like on high school and I was in middle school. And I would like my body cast after my first boyfriend was up like so fast, they were like up to 15 and then I like on 2018 2019 I was like what the hell, am I doing you know. But I used to get drunk and and be like really active like I would even be with strangers literally the first night I might and stuff like that yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And that is sometimes that that piece keeps playing out and were you know getting drunk and it would like make it where even more so, where you're not thinking about it you're just doing the actions. You know versa, I am I just want to encourage you, because I am really you know I commend you for. starting to open this door to was there trauma there, I want to sort this out. And I want to understand a little bit more about myself, this is a good, this is a good place and I know earlier, you said you feel like you're bringing up so much stuff well there's so much stuff that you endured, and that you went through. And, and maybe these other things that you're thinking."
13365.0,Patient,and other events.
705.0,Provider,"yeah with with trauma to a lot of times in your mind you're trying to sort it out and things don't make sense and that's why you keep thinking about it, you know, sometimes a person. Like you were talking about the car accident is after that car accident you kept replaying what that was like and it took you a while to be comfortable being a passenger in the car."
13365.0,Patient,"And I mean I remember that accident, because I was six team. That was not too far ago I guess yeah."
705.0,Provider,"that's you know that type of trauma you could probably you know if you were 16 verse yeah after that happen, you probably really could fake about you know what you saw during the time of your car crash what what smells going on."
13365.0,Patient,"I don't remember much. The it was I was I wasn't unconscious I was like i'm aware all the time, I even stand up try to get out and. But I don't remember, much like. From the the accident like on the time. I just remember like little parts."
705.0,Provider,"On that's where to with trauma like what the car accident is sometimes your your brain just is trying to piece it together it's still like Okay, I remember this, or people have to tell you, you know well, this is what happened. After the car accident and the first responders are there and take you through it. Just like that you know you went through a terrible car accident, and now you know you're you're driving right. And before you couldn't even be a passenger in the car, so you work through it, where you felt more comfortable and secure. And that's also what can be the same thing versa, as you go along, and you talk more about what you feel like may have happened is when you were a child, you know with any type of sexual abuse."
13365.0,Patient,say.
705.0,Provider,"that's that's Okay, I know you can't really get the light on and you're trying for privacy to shut the door. i'll cry I you know a lot of times to as you go through this is, I like to always check in because sometimes we start talking about these things you start building some really strong feelings and sometimes people internalize it. to a point where it gets really in this negative place where you know self harm or things like that. Is any. Is Have you had like that coming up for you receive."
13365.0,Patient,What exactly.
705.0,Provider,"With any type of self harm like have you in the last. Lately, or when was the last time."
13365.0,Patient,It was a long time ago. told you. I covered my scars.
705.0,Provider,With the butterfly and something right.
13365.0,Patient,You can't see them anymore.
705.0,Provider,That looks awesome. that's beautiful how nice. How do you feel about it.
13365.0,Patient,I like it.
705.0,Provider,What does it represent for you.
13365.0,Patient,whoa. whoa everything honestly like. That i've been through. I guess i'm still struggling a little.
705.0,Provider,"And you know that's the beauty of to a tattoo is where you said you know where there was the Marks and. And that the scar sometimes remind us of where we've been and so you were creative with blending that through you know. blending that with it, where it's like okay you can't see it anymore, but it also gives you strength to know where you were before and where you are today and that you don't have a desire to do that anymore. And you're able to talk about it, you can do different things today that you weren't able to in the past. yeah. And then you chose to the butterfly and the flowers."
13365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"What, then, with if we look at symbols, you know, are what this is, you know represent how about the butterfly for you."
13365.0,Patient,"Well, like. Basically, growing like evolution making yourself better. And yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and then the flowers."
13365.0,Patient,"The same you know, like. kind of it goes related like together."
705.0,Provider,yeah a lot of. Growth and transformation change.
13365.0,Patient,The word that's those are the word. I can think of those.
705.0,Provider,"Now I just again I like how it goes, and then you have the butterfly out this side and it just. I don't know something about it, to proceed just is like how the butterfly is it's almost like a sense of freedom, I guess is the word i'm thinking of."
13365.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's where during during counseling to pursue it may be, you know, on some levels tough to go there and to share and be open and honest. But, again, I encourage you to to share with with Andrea and let her know even more where it's that aspect of setting yourself free where it's like no we're going to talk about things we're going to sort it out and i'm going to. keep talking about it and trying to. put in place. Early childhood milestones and then where I am today. milestones meaning events that you can remember that maybe you feel were more positive and then other life changing events that maybe we're not."

13365.0,Patient,Is it Maybe you can say it and then.
705.0,Provider,"If you give me permission to say it, then I would be happy to just say you know. Do you want me to disclose that you're going to the ED program or do you want me to just say you're going to be transferring to one of our other groups."
13365.0,Patient,Transferring.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and then, if you feel like hey you know I want to share a little bit more than you can there's. Probably in the group to there's probably others that have. been through similar things with ED. Most most of the groups, I would say received at least one if not two people have had that happen either early on, or in their adulthood."
13365.0,Patient,"Well, you can share it to it, you know, maybe they can think about it too."
705.0,Provider,"Well, what i'll do is it so are you, seeing that you wouldn't be comfortable if I say that you're going to the program has to address the ED stuff. Okay, and then i'll ask the Group because, if some of the others want to share to have what they did it might be helpful for you to hear that, too, if they feel comfortable with sharing."
13365.0,Patient,yeah that would be great cuz i'm not gonna see them anyway.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, well, it will be good to pursue then to have some form of group closure and I always say like instead of goodbye it's more just see because you never know in our past may cross again. mm hmm yeah."

No thoughts no plan no intent, in fact, she did a tattoo to cover up her self harm and she is at this point, this is our closure session, she is now transferring over to the eating disorder or she can start to address for. The eating disorder in those types of needs and then also from today's session patient is starting to be a little bit more open and honest about. The possibility that there was childhood, sexual abuse and she's trying to come with turn to terms with that and understanding it. she's questioning if she's relating this and it has no merit, or if it does. And then there was some other events that she's piecing together, such as in high school where she had a boyfriend and he would ask her to do things to. that she would feel uncomfortable about and so she's wanting to explore that a little bit more I shared with her that the eating disorder program will be reaching out to her, she begins in November, which is right around the corner and we will go from there."
