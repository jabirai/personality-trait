My group meeting last night and normally if I like I missed it twice, because I was sick but i'm normally I messaged them and they know that i'm not going to be there, well actually once I messaged him beforehand any other time, I went to the beginning of group and then just left early. But I know normally do try to communicate what's going on and everything I just I woke up this morning, thinking that I had brew and that this afternoon, and then I got a message from bright heart saying that I missed. And I need to call and a. lot of them screw it up in my head."

165.0,Provider,"You know why it's actually just been insane crappy like year and a half, so you're totally fine I get it, I. know it has been exceptionally you know crappier and crazier than the husband, historically, you know but but you're totally fine, I just wanted it, you know I just have some like tease I have to cross and eyes, I have to adopt so. Because of the missed appointments and the and the huge emphasis that we're that we're putting on attendance to therapy now I am able to bridge you to your next group therapy appointment, which I think is on the."
6882.0,Patient,"Eighth if i'm not mistaken, Wednesday that's always."
165.0,Provider,"Okay yep so Wednesday the eighth. Because of the missed appointments and I can read you exactly what it says it just says that. Due to note multiple patient know showed multiple appointments in the last 15 days and multiple appointments over the last 30 days, reduce our X to four days a second bridge to next appointment instruct patient must have 1015 days without a no show for scripts to be increased. In addition to that, it looks like your drug screen is up to date so there's no there's no. restriction on that, but there is a another note that says restrict our X to four days with second rx to bridge to next appointment because of the individual therapy that you that you're missing as well, so um. So, and then that me, and so, in order to get a longer prescription than four days, you have to go to both an individual therapy session, as well as go to all of your appointments for the next 15 days without a no show. Now you have to if you cancel a group therapy appointment that's different Okay, but you have to actually attend the next individual therapy like your your prescription can't be increased until you attend. Individual therapy okay alrighty."
6882.0,Patient,So i'm right so yeah no I. Get I get what you're saying. And i'll definitely be.
165.0,Provider,"I just wanted, I just wanted to let you know that that's why i'm doing what i'm doing, and so, and what I am doing is calling in your prescription and four day increments so you'll get a four day supply plus one refill. And so, then you'll you'll have you'll get you know you'll get four days today, and then you know, five days from now you'll pick up and then the next four days you'll and you'll have one day past your next group therapy session of medication okay. Just just for more of those you know, like technicalities, if you will when's the last time you took a dose of buprenorphine naloxone. This morning. Okay. Perfect you're breaking up a little bit again so you're but you're fine."
