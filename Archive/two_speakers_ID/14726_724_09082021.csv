724.0,Provider,"For transcription i'm scheduled to meet with brandon Leyva patient ID 147 to six at 9am Pacific standard time for a bio psychosocial assessment client did check into a virtual clinic i'm just waiting for him to join the sessions meeting. which he has now I will admit the patient, and we will start the psychosocial assessment."
14726.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,hey what's going on brand and finance chuck how you doing.
14726.0,Patient,Good how are you.
724.0,Provider,"I can't complain. nobody listens to me. uh so you're here today to do a an assessment with me. Okay that's called a bio psychosocial assessment. Which is the cover some some brief history on your biology, a brief history on your psychology or like like a yeah I guess psychology history and then. Your social setting and the idea is after the assessments completed any trained clinician could read through it without having met you and see what areas of interest, there are and ways to develop treatment planning for you. Some of the questions are generic some of the questions might be somewhat sensitive or private if you feel uncomfortable at any time answering any of these questions just be like I don't want to answer that and we'll just skip it. table it for later, times have you ever been a treatment before. No okay. mice my follow up question would have been like had you been in treatment, you probably would have these assessments it's very common practice a box medical in clinical settings to do stuff like this, so before we start do you have any questions or concerns like right out of the gate."
14726.0,Patient,No.
724.0,Provider,"Okay um so with this assessment it's going to cover five or six general areas like I said earlier, it's going to talk about your history with substance abuse any mental health concerns medical history social settings and. Some basic demographics now i'm sure you probably if if you just joined this program you probably answer these questions on different types of assessments are. The doctors and so, so there might be some redundancies, but we'll get through those okay so and, lastly, I just asked that we stay on topic, which means like when I asked you. Some of these questions, they tend to segue into other questions later down the road. So I just asked people to stay on top of the current question because i'm going to end up asking you a similar question down the road and some people feel offended they're like well. This guy's not listen to me I just answered that question five minutes ago, so to avoid like any kind of redundancies like that will just stay on topic makes sense. yeah okay up so if you're ready to rock and roll, we can go yeah."

724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right that's a i'm not going to say that that that's totally uncommon when you when you mix alcohol and cocaine. It creates a new drug new euphoria, and your and your gut ironically. So some people will use both those drugs to achieve that high. School like Fo Coco lean. which I had not been aware of her a long time until. Maybe a couple years into my you know practicing as a therapist. was kind of interesting all right anyway withdrawal symptoms that you've ever experienced once you've stopped using. Yes, okay what were those."
14726.0,Patient,Just the extreme restlessness the sweating the eyes hurting headache. diary diarrhea. You can't sleep you just you feel like your body's gonna. it's just. force feeling in the world.

14726.0,Patient,We could go.
724.0,Provider,um. Would you say that when you use opiates currently do you still experience you for you or you just using to avoid being you know dope sick.
14726.0,Patient,of both yeah I still when I was taking I was still filling euphoria. But I had to take a lot.
724.0,Provider,Okay that's what you.
14726.0,Patient,have to take more than normal yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right um. Any history of overdose."

724.0,Provider,Do you have access to like narc and all that kind of good stuff.
14726.0,Patient,know they mentioned that last time I don't I don't have any of that.
724.0,Provider,I i'm on the east coast so i'm not sure what are you in California. yeah yeah i'm not sure what what the States policies but and it's worth looking into but on my end if you have state insurance like you can go to like walgreens or CVs and without question they'll give you a narc and.
14726.0,Patient,So is it again. narcan yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah it's the blow like if you if you OD somebody has to administer it and what it does it's supposed to knock all the illicit opiates off of your receptors and bring you out of it. yeah it's highly effective that's called an Arc and. So I would imagine that most states are you know lock step as far as that being a policy would say it insurance providers to get people are can so it'd be something to look into obviously it's not going to do any good if you're by yourself and you odd like somebody.
14726.0,Patient,"Yes, give it to you."
724.0,Provider,But it's definitely good to have a lot of first responders they tend to look for like. On the person so because they want to give you too much of it right all right. what's your longest period of sobriety.
14726.0,Patient,Eight months.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, one was a."
14726.0,Patient,And I think like five years ago.
724.0,Provider,And how did you how did you go about getting that.
14726.0,Patient,"I had the time I was. lost my job, I was going through some mental issues and. I was having suicidal thoughts and I told a therapist about it and they recommended that I should go. into a hospital for 72 hours."
724.0,Provider,You know.
14726.0,Patient,"You got put on the 72 hour hold. And I came and part of that was because I was still addicted to pills, and so. yeah I just say I stopped doing the bills, then I mean, I was in the hospital going through withdrawals and. When I came into the hospital I just continued to stay in off of them. And I managed to stay off him for about eight months."
724.0,Provider,"Good. Alright, so the next section is going to be about medical history and the section that follows that's going to be psychological history, so we keep them separate so medical will deal with the physical ailments of the body, so any any history of medical concerns high blood pressure, diabetes. hepatitis cancer."
14726.0,Patient,I have rheumatoid arthritis.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, do you take any medications for it."
14726.0,Patient,yeah right now i'm on methotrexate and folic acid.
724.0,Provider,Any other medications that you take. Not right now and describe to you. What about in the past.
14726.0,Patient,yeah because of my arthritis i've been on every every arthritis medicine promising humira. chicane remember this is. The greatest medicine i've been on it.
724.0,Provider,Okay um some other other physical ailments.
14726.0,Patient,know just start guys i've had both my hips replaced twice.
724.0,Provider,Your hips.
14726.0,Patient,yeah wow.
724.0,Provider,wow okay what was that about.
14726.0,Patient,Just there are dry CIV or out the joints there's no more cartilage in between the bone.
724.0,Provider,Okay.
14726.0,Patient,"So they had to. replace it, because I couldn't even walk because it was just too painful. The arthritis that I have just eats the cartilage and all of your joints."
724.0,Provider,"All right, is oh sorry to hear that. yeah i'm outside of the hip replacements any of that."
14726.0,Patient,"that's why I kind of got addicted to pills, because I basically live in pain every day so. That took away the pain so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean the pain medication and pain management like like they do, they do their job. Their job to well. yeah so it's like a. it's a creepy dance that that providers have to try to play, because the human body is very receptive to developing the chemical dependencies on our colleagues very quickly. And they're managing some time, like the long term management to get off of it still. is difficult but it doesn't resolve the the initial reason for being on it so like a lot of people that are like injured or you know people like you, that have chronic chronic daily pain like it's it's a weird dance that they have to play, because there is no real therapeutic. yeah lunch, that they can provide for you, where it's like you take this stuff now and it helps this but long term it's going to create on the problems and it's like."
14726.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's like it's no different than taking like ibuprofen for a long periods of time it's like yeah it's going to help with inflammation but it's going to jack your kidneys up to. You, you have the stomach liner so it's like. You don't want to deal with the pain today and worry about the paint tomorrow, you know, so it is it's it's difficult."
14726.0,Patient,So yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I wish, there was a better solution but currently haven't discovered one yet. yeah i'm okay any allergies, the medication."
14726.0,Patient,No okay.

724.0,Provider,"Okay, and. and any or any of them successful or."
14726.0,Patient,"not really. um now okay usually I didn't care for the side effects, so I usually ended up stopping them and never really noticed that much of a difference."
724.0,Provider,Okay um. What was the last time you talked to anybody about depression.
14726.0,Patient,Probably four years ago.
724.0,Provider,And how is your how's your mental health today.

724.0,Provider,What do you think that's about.
14726.0,Patient,"I think, just when I get depressed I tend to eat more."
724.0,Provider,i'm sure Kobe and being locked of ways and helping anybody's mental health how's it how's coven affected you.
14726.0,Patient,And that bad actually I don't mind it. I think it's just. Not working i've been applying places and just not being able to find a job okay all right.
724.0,Provider,"All right, um. Any hospital, he said that you were put on a 72 hour hold yeah so was that the only time you went to law school for him and i'll. yeah okay so walk me through what that was about."
14726.0,Patient,"was just. yeah I recently lost my job, like quit and then. This girl that I was kind of having a relationship with she broke up with me at the time and then also. I. The the pill addiction that gotten pretty bad. And I just felt like it was I was never going to be able to. Stop with the bills, though they were going to be there forever and it was just. And all that stuff combined it was just."
724.0,Provider,A lot.
14726.0,Patient,"yeah it's just everything hit me at once, and it just. yeah I was in a bad place and. Mostly I just thought about my son and I didn't want to leave him so that's when I told the therapist about it all, and she recommended I gone to the go into a whole. So I did."
724.0,Provider,"And what happened there, and the second two hours, what did they do."
14726.0,Patient,"Nothing, they just kept me in a room with other people and. I think I talked they didn't really talk to me it was just more like it was at UCLA UCLA hospital oh you don't know where that is um it's it says, apparently, I shouldn't have done what I did because apparently it's like a really bad hospital to do that in. Okay, it was just like I was kept in a room with like 20 other people. Just in a bad for three days and just miserable it was awful i'm just. yeah I, and I was going through withdrawals and I didn't tell anybody about it. Oh, that was just like I was just like suffering in there yeah."
724.0,Provider,"So I before I took this job I did two years at the one of the local hospitals in my state, and I was in the psych Ward or behavioral health unit, which is like a nicer way of saying a. psych Ward. yeah for emergency holds. And detox essentially and really. In this particular hospital, the city police department really use it as like they're dumping ground for all their problems that they didn't want it to deal with, for the rest of the COPs. And this particular town, now the county is. really large. You know there's probably like four or five different police departments that could have done the same thing, but this one in particular department. Just lazy and. You don't know me, and they would literally get calls out for people that are intoxicated but they weren't causing civil disturbances. house and in their significant other coffee that God has gotten drunk and he's loud and it's like Okay, and they just bring them straight to the hospital and now that then individual racked up like an insane amount of hospitals and it's like. hey my time when I was a kid you know what if if somebody was drunk like their friends with this take care of them, you know. Rarely ever got involved so, but this particular farm would just drop off. trunks all night. which was counterproductive, because the unit was really meant for people that had. yeah mental health concerns that they they are either completely off the rails off medication and really, really needed to be monitored, or there are people. Like you, that would probably like just needed some time to decompress and isolate probably get some insight and then you would just mix. off the rails relatively normal you know, to make some environmental factors down there and then drunk people and then all of them together is made a recipe for disaster. So I worked on that unit for two years, and it was crazy and everything that you just said, as far as. Keeping people on their bed for a few days of really not doing much form was not improving people's mental health and that's why the yeah so I."
14726.0,Patient,Was yeah.
724.0,Provider,"And we'd have people there and I would argue, a lot with the administration in the nursing staff and i'm like we're literally not helping anybody in here. Like my goal was to kind of lay people fistfights all night is where it really turned into."
14726.0,Patient,A.
724.0,Provider,"hey like you're you're not helping so in a perfect world, you would have your own unit and have access to. and celebrate your services, you know providers and not have to worry about the guy next to you like like getting up and then peeing on the floor because he's so intoxicated you."
14726.0,Patient,Know yeah.
724.0,Provider,So they had those settings or not they're not helpful.
14726.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You know you talk to a social worker once and and then you're there, for you know. Three four days and you're like I don't know what's going on here what's the plan and nobody tells you."
14726.0,Patient,Exactly what happened with me.
724.0,Provider,"So yeah so your experiences that you make, sir. it's like that everywhere and I don't know if it's a insurance issue or just the nature of the health care services in this country i'm not sure, but."
14726.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,i'm sorry that you had to do with that.
14726.0,Patient,yeah thanks. It was an experience for sure.
724.0,Provider,"yeah when I talked to two people and one of the doctors that does the group with me he's an er doctor and the very first night that he i've met and we're gonna be like co facilitating I was like yeah I worked in the er and the mental health award in his eyes just got. Huge and he was like oh so you know, and I was like Why is a gap an er doctor like oh so you know, like it's like a secret handshake were like yeah it's. You know it's crazy and for like lay people you know what I mean when you think of the er it's like people go there because they're very sick or they haven't like I never thought I was going to see the things that I saw like. I didn't correlate that like that that type of thing I was like holy get this place is crazy. It was it was definitely experience but I learned a lot, because most of my clinical work has been in substance abuse. medication assisted therapy pain management therapy, I did some Inpatient court ordered stuff so it's like abstinence based so my spectrum was, like all over the place. But really I got like a. Like a good education in real mental health concerns. Because most substance abuse is co co occurring, you know so it's like people are either addicted to drugs and alcohol, because they have other like mental health concerns. or people that are addicted to drugs or alcohol have created other like mental health concerns, so you always trying to figure out what the root causes. And, not to say that, like some people like yeah the press and it's like yeah you probably are and then you find out that it's like my dog just died or whatever it is like or I lost my job it's like yeah you should be. bummed out about that stuff yeah for sure you should be experienced that it's up and I saw like. Real depression, where it's like oh okay or real manic episodes and so you're like i'm a little crazy today it's like yeah maybe yeah and then you find out what's going on it's like i've seen people where it's like they're so out of it that you're like we can't talk to them anymore. We typically restrain them. Because the past the point of. Any kind of like. conversation and you're like Okay, so it gave me a good baseline for. identify like real mental health versus environmental concerns so. Definitely interesting yeah."
14726.0,Patient,Mine definitely stems from mostly from arthritis it's just.
724.0,Provider,yep.
14726.0,Patient,"and chronic pain, will do my life."
724.0,Provider,"yeah essentially will run your life that's a good way of putting it. I injured my neck several years ago, like significantly and cause long term atrophy and my arm and my chest nerve damage and it's like chronic pain all the time and then. I would go to the doctor and i'd be like how's your pain level today i'm like. I don't know and they're like what I was like it's a, six, seven or an eight every day so it's like. yeah how's it right now it's like well I wasn't really thinking about it until you brought it up so like if i'm not thinking about it, then it's not too bad that's that's like the weird metric in my head. you're like Oh, you know I haven't thought about it for a little while, so I must be doing Okay, or if i'll sit funny and it's like nope there it is. yeah so yeah chronic pain it psychologically, it will beat you down yeah. yeah and it's unfortunate do you see anybody for like physical therapy or occupational health or anything like that."
14726.0,Patient,"I just starting again because I just got insurance that's why i'm doing all this stuff. Okay, I haven't had insurance for a couple years. So yeah I just started seeing my rheumatologist getting back on medication and. yeah i'll probably goes get therapy soon, because I. My knee has to be replaced now the next thing going."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it's like a like a structural thing it's like when you have an injury, in a certain area, the body will be in the competency and then over time because of that compensation other things start fall apart so structurally like it's always like out of whack on the."
14726.0,Patient,that's my legs yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it's like. Because I hurt my neck. My my right side, which is my dominant side like I can't really do. Like nothing is 100% on my right side anymore i've gotten. A lot better you know, like I used to be able to do like lots of push ups and. You know I went from being able to do a bunch of to one day and i'll be able to do any and then having to restart up to that point."
14726.0,Patient,You know what I mean.
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah ever be 100% so like i'll do like a pull up and i'm like. compensate so like because that comes to my left side is starting to hurt like my God like you know my my left hip is out of.
14726.0,Patient,alignment because it's yeah.

And, and probably most clinicians do too is like I used to consider the addict, you know as a behavior chemical dependency as something that despite all your best efforts it's really not within your control it's your body is now telling you what to do. On So if you didn't have added behavior it's like yeah I went I I robbed a liquor store or whatever it was and it's like well yeah I have a behavioral issue two. But when it comes to narcotics man like like it'll turn anybody into first off chemically dependent and then, as a result of those physical symptoms. Would it, however, you manage that, whether or not it's. criminally or professionally like that's kind of like that's like the delineation between like like in my head like what an addict is and and what somebody who's kind of be dependent is and a lot of."

On here are. You know that there are state and federal mandates are like you can use buprenorphine, which is in suboxone the treat some pain management in certain states, but you can't use a box at all to treat payment and it's like it's like politic this creepy.

14726.0,Patient,No.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, good all right well. that's it on my end. Some of the housecleaning that we have to do, surveys did anybody explain to you how to do the surveys here."
14726.0,Patient,"Now they sent me an email with a bunch of surveys, I already did the DEMO."
724.0,Provider,"Okay yep you're going to be you're going to want to save that that website that links, you know. bookmark it start however you do it. And then you're going to be required to do those things like weekly. And I don't know if they populate you're an IT guy. So maybe you can tell me if there's a better way of doing it, but I don't. I don't know if they populate with which ones are do or the onus is on you to remember, which ones to do when so I just been telling people to. log in on like a weekend night for the upcoming we do the surveys that are there are. Like are they actually like Are they in the right whatever health portal."
14726.0,Patient,"website is that, where they'll show up."
724.0,Provider,Wherever you wherever you went to complete the initial ones is going to be where they are all the time. So there should be like a link for the survey.
14726.0,Patient,"Okay cuz he just sent me an email, and it had like do this survey and then do this survey and then do this survey. yeah that was it."
724.0,Provider,"yeah, so I would save that email because that's probably where they're going to be. But like I said so that they have like a like a pain management one they have a depression one and anxiety one a one that's called like a band seven and it's like 33 questions long you know all. The band of seven I believe is do every week. It varies based on like why."
14726.0,Patient,"Okay yeah so he gave me yet to have them for weekly, he said, the pH Q nine. yep in the band seven."
724.0,Provider,"yep so those those ones are going to want to do, like every Sunday night because it technically do before your group okay. Okay, so, but for some people it's like when is my group, so what."
14726.0,Patient,Do I do it anymore.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so theoretically, you would do yours it like. At some point before four o'clock on Friday, because that will get the doctor that an opportunity to like review it because people will go to group and they'll be like, oh no everything's perfect great happy. Good to go and then the doctor will read the survey and like now, this person is like super depressed super anxious and that's not conducive to what they're saying in the group, so it is important. For also required by state and federal government. to have some kind of form that's measurable for client success or lack thereof, and the surveys, are a good way to get that done, you know because it's self reporting."
14726.0,Patient,"All right, thanks for let me know yeah set up an alarm to. yeah so you would everyone."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean if you're in. If you're in. Your pain management it's. yeah it's the band seven. And the pH tonight and and the gad seven you'll see a lot, which is the general anxiety one sit that one seven questions the pH Q nine is nine questions."
14726.0,Patient,and
724.0,Provider,"You know the band seven to seven stands for weekly seven days that one is the longest one I even did it's 33 questions, but I would imagine it took me about 10 minutes. But I would imagine once you get comfortable doing it you'll probably be able to blow right through them."
14726.0,Patient,So yeah I did I did them very fast.
724.0,Provider,yeah so just be on top of them.
14726.0,Patient,yeah okay.
724.0,Provider,"Because they are there more than just just a nuisance, we just don't put them in there to you know. To give patients a hard time, like the feds wanted the State wants it. Are craving companies and agencies wanted, they are important, so just."
14726.0,Patient,pick a day gotta jump in.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it's like. Like the bureaucracy runs deep and you know. Like like shit rolls downhill like it really is it's. yeah everybody has to do it. So that's that so that's the survey thing and answer good measure to be they have like the satisfaction survey, you know, so we know for doing a good job or poor job and it allows us to to make changes like where the where they where they need to be. This is a growing company. I think they've only been around for about five years so they're doing pretty well."
14726.0,Patient,So.
724.0,Provider,"Surveys are important. Okay alright so that's that i'll. reach out to the care navigation to have them schedule a follow up with me in about a couple of weeks, and then. we'll go from there any questions or."
