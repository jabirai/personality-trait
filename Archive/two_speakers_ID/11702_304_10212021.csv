11702.0,Patient,it's a different dollar general and it's it's yeah it's just that I didn't mean to say I didn't do any goals I just. I don't know. i'm still getting used to this job and I don't know I didn't I didn't really think it's been on my mind I guess it's been really hectic.
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it so, is it is it just the stress of that."
11702.0,Patient,there.
304.0,Provider,Any money john.

11702.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, just the stress of the job and getting used to it."
11702.0,Patient,yeah it's just yeah.
304.0,Provider,"Okay. Last man neighbor they want to use it, they want to promote you to a management position."
11702.0,Patient,"Well they're training me to be one, I think, but there's some girls there that thought they were going to get that position so that's not going over so on. They actually know more than me at this time, but whatever it is, and I think they make too many mistakes or with money and stuff so they don't really like me and the wondering why the hell. You know. But it is what it is."
304.0,Provider,"How did, how do you feel about the promotion or the possible."
11702.0,Patient,"Is I like it just. I don't know it's a lot of stress I know. They are backed up you know and they don't want to they want to do things their way and I got to do things their way and they're not getting stuff on the shelves fast enough, no one is you know."
304.0,Provider,I see.
11702.0,Patient,"I tried, I said i'd be willing to you know i'd be willing to work over the night lock the doors and let's just stop the damn shelves I don't even understand people come in, they can't find what they want and. there's no reason, in my opinion that shelf should be back."
304.0,Provider,"yeah so you're kind of seeing the customers frustration, because they can't find what they need."
11702.0,Patient,"That and they they got they are the truck was late, a month, so that the truck comes every week. So the store went bare basically and then now the whole back of the building that customers don't go into is like you gotta squeeze through it's that bad it's crazy bad."
304.0,Provider,Because the truck did come in and now there's so much stuff.
11702.0,Patient,"yeah and then a truck came in, right after that and just the whole thing is filled back there it's crazy. So."
304.0,Provider,you're offering to kind of. hell and.
11702.0,Patient,"stupid to me because they make more money pay somebody to you know, a couple guys that work over the night, while no one's in there and just stuck. and I don't know. They don't want to pay more than two people to work there for shifts either so they let the customers just have a long ass line you know this is stupid. But other than that it's going OK that's a job i'm learning new things you know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah and you know it seems like the pandemic has just it's like oh we're so sick, you know everyone's so sick of it but it's like it's affecting things in so many ways of truck drivers there's another truck drivers or there's not enough."
11702.0,Patient,"See the docs that I don't remember where it was but it's in South South southern end of the country. They got all these boats just sitting outside the docks and then they showed like an aerial picture of it, then they showed. Basically, like a computer aided a computer image of it we're all the red dots are and they're just. backed up just sitting there."
304.0,Provider,"it's terrible. I mean, I am glad you're working and you're contributing, and you know you're being productive and."
11702.0,Patient,yeah I am i'm not ready to go back to machining just yet.
304.0,Provider,I know.
11702.0,Patient,"People talk about this funny I I wasn't after the money, I was just looking to actually cut my mind and have some money you know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah but it sounds like you didn't anticipate it being this stressful either, and all of this other things that. yeah it sounds sounds like it's kind of poorly managed or poorly run."
11702.0,Patient,"yeah cuz the other dollar general I worked at was just I just ran the cash register and stocked sometimes and that place was so clean and organized makes me wonder, you know what my boss is I don't know I don't know. where it comes from that they don't want to get shipped down. there's don't want to pay corporate don't want to pay anymore, and they got their rules and. So a lot of stupid things you know, knowing there's coming up right. But they weigh the money you know take. Four more minutes to count $150 and register says, why do we got away at you know. yeah which said, you know when he sneaks in with the dollars you grab a packet dollars, and you can be offered this a lot of things can be awesome people. You know any other people i'm used to Wayne things i've waited parts machine shop, you know. I don't know I understand more I don't know I don't know I just I think some people are too. hard on the aware because it's kind of flimsy and I don't know if they're waiting and stuff correctly, but nothing's coming out right it's not my fault i'm like trying to tell him and just double teams, they need to take some extra precautions and things. Like first encounter have another person can't verify."
304.0,Provider,verify yeah I. never heard of weighing. I have never heard of weighing money.
11702.0,Patient,"yeah. Can you hear me they they weigh the change but that's already got the plastic ball added into that so you put the plastic ball on there and zero on the way in the change and. You know, there can be quarters and the nickel slots and someone might way that or whatever it is, I don't know, I just want to get it down to the bottom of it. Because i've been i've been $5 over and $5 under no. matter how hard, I tried I don't know."
304.0,Provider,yeah or it almost seems like a lot of places don't want to give you change back you know they say the corn coin shortage Please pay with a card.
11702.0,Patient,"I just stay after a period of time, I think i'll be able to implement some of these things. Just to get to the bottom of it. there's got to be it's either operator air or something's going on with machines, because they freeze up. This the yeah To be honest, I wish I would have stayed at planet fitness. But you know."
304.0,Provider,Can you go back.
11702.0,Patient,"i'm thinking about trying i'm not going to give up that yet that easily. Only been there, a week and a half or so."
304.0,Provider,You said it was more money at dollar general right.
11702.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's more money $23 more for minimum wage, not only make $14 an hour. Which is crazy, you know there's been people there, I feel bad some of the people that been there forever they started out at 850 minimum wage. And then you they had like assistant managers they're making 1175 me and so when minimum rate increased the any dinging that comes into the store, with no experience gets $11 an hour."
304.0,Provider,I.
11702.0,Patient,got a small manager making 1175 to me.
304.0,Provider,The reason.
11702.0,Patient,That they didn't raise it for the manager know so it's that I feel like that's an even like. If your manager and you got to open a store and you got to be responsible for all these people and you got to take all this extra responsibility when minimum wage went up I think they should attacked on that $3 or whatever it was to someone that was already making. You know. That its way it works. For such a big company people say oh dollar general such a big company pretty cheap.
304.0,Provider,"yeah sounds like a. Well, you, you seem really happy when you were at planet fitness and it seemed like that was a good environment for you."
11702.0,Patient,"Any any drop my. My soapbox and down but gave me the same milligrams I don't really want to do that said I had a choice, but. I don't know I kind of like breakfast lunch and dinner thing I got used to that it's like i'm going through a stressful period in my job, and you know I talked about you know quitting xanax and you know laying off the alcohol."
304.0,Provider,shifts you know.
11702.0,Patient,"Does that to me says, I won't notice the difference, but i'm used to doing that you know i'm used to the three times a day I don't really feel the suboxone, but I do initially feel it when I take it for a little bit. So now. I gotta take a higher dose which i'm not used to. I haven't done this yet because i'm like a week behind so i'm still doing my eight, so I want to see how it goes."
304.0,Provider,So you're on 32 milligrams a day. 2424 okay.
11702.0,Patient,"Well, so I was I started."
304.0,Provider,Around 32.
11702.0,Patient,I started on 32 I went down to 20 438 today.
304.0,Provider,OK.
11702.0,Patient,"And now he has me on to 12 per day. it's the same month I think his way of bringing me down is this went from four to three, and then to 12 milligrams and then he's gonna say okay well i'll bring you down to 80 milligrams."
304.0,Provider,Right.
11702.0,Patient,"But he gave me the option I don't I don't really want to do it, but I saw him whatever you think is best ah."
304.0,Provider,yeah but leave but yeah I mean it's the same amount. Right same amount so it's not going to make you feel it's it's the same amount.
11702.0,Patient,But I do feel them like when I take them. You know so. i'm going to be taking a higher dose that i'm used to the supposed to last longer.
304.0,Provider,"Exactly. Most people are on to most people are on to you've been with the program you know this long people stay on three maybe, just like a month or two when they first first start out so it's only been two days right."
11702.0,Patient,I haven't even started to 12.
304.0,Provider,"Okay, you haven't even started it yet and you're already you're already pushing back on it so."
11702.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I don't want to take a higher dose and because, like I said i'm struggling with other things i'm trying to use the box."
304.0,Provider,As a crutch the box on isn't. It isn't a magic pill it's not going to fix your life it's not going to fix your stress it's not going to.
11702.0,Patient,"crush it well, it fits my life um Lisa."
304.0,Provider,But it's not going to fix the way that. You right but it's not going to fix the way you think about things it's not a light switch that's going to solve every problem in your life is.
11702.0,Patient,"A lot, though, because. Like I said yeah if you are on fat. And you go to starbucks and you don't feel suboxone at all, but after a period of time without the fat now I start to feel the suboxone a little bit you know I like taking my three day. amount. And then wait and then take your I don't know what."
304.0,Provider,"I told my argument what's about some does is it mitigates withdraw it, it gets you from not getting into that. precipitated withdrawal. And it prevents you from having crazy looks. It doesn't fix your relationships, but doesn't fix the way you handle stress it doesn't fix the way that you. Think about things. are better. You know so just try it, though you haven't even tried it yet."
11702.0,Patient,"I understand that, but i'm. Like I said I didn't i'm trying to quit other things and I i've been successful, with the opiates you know. And it's been a period of time, but i'm still using that as a crutch to not drink alcohol or not take xanax you know i'm just trying to use just this for a while, because, like right now I feel like. i've got the fat out of my brain, you know. it's like I don't even think about it anymore, you know, but I also have other addiction issues that i've been just using this as a crutch to get through the days. To get through the days of not you know one one day two weeks to two months, the longer it goes the more my brain forgets about it, you know."
304.0,Provider,"So, are you saying that you feel like you still are having issues as far as the bends those are at for drinking there's. That temptation for you."
11702.0,Patient,yeah there is I don't want I haven't been doing so.
304.0,Provider,"Okay. Well yeah let's I mean, I think you have you do have anxiety, I think you. You have some really concrete ways of thinking about things. Like you have a lot of really very black and white all or nothing thinking. And so I want you to kind of just be a little bit more open. To just you know checking out the Mara international you don't have to share you could just listen. and think about your stress level and and what's going to be work for you, you know I mean I don't know your financial situation or. You know, so you have to do what what's best for you, but I I just see how stressed out, you are now and, and it seems like you were happy when you were at planet fitness."
11702.0,Patient,"yeah well I expect all this to pass i'm just saying at the moment i'm stressed out day, so I hate my life and too."
304.0,Provider,Much like. six.
11702.0,Patient,"They were calling for our time. Sometimes I only work six hours or seven hours or whatever to fill in for somebody or whatnot but yeah they got me for basically six days a week. And they were trying to call me and I made off, you know. yeah So when I was on video with you i'm getting text messages saying hey so and so's babysit baby's sick, can you come in, you know I ended up getting I ended up running down there, right after meeting."
304.0,Provider,"that's stressful Lee. So you think, though, that this is an acute stress or it's gonna get better oh yeah it's just the."
11702.0,Patient,Adjustment that's all.
304.0,Provider,yeah. And I want.
11702.0,Patient,"to it, and I want to move up to where they trust me and I want to be able to. get my ideas. Because I think I could do a better job than my actual manager, you really do."
304.0,Provider,"Believe think about though that going down to you're not really going down you're you're on the same dose think about the two strips again. This is just your hearing a little bit of a stressful situation right now it's not going to last forever, you know getting used to that taking it two times a day same thing it's not going to last forever it's an adjustment, but."
11702.0,Patient,know how.
304.0,Provider,to that. I mean that that is between you and Dr Steve um but but you're not back you.
11702.0,Patient,"don't people and he said I can switch back if I don't like it, but he was adamant that I tracks, I think he wants me to get used to. Not taking something all the time."
304.0,Provider,I you know you need. To not taking a substance when you feel a certain way.
11702.0,Patient,"What do you mean well well yeah I take you just to get through my day is, and you know I like to take it three times a day because that helps me like if I take us a box and I feel it for about an hour."
304.0,Provider,"Just a little bit, so the goal is the goal is to move you away from this idea that you need a substance to feel better."
11702.0,Patient,"yeah I don't want to go back, I mean I think Mara like some places they don't ever you don't ever have to come off mute the rest your life."
304.0,Provider,"I was saying, you have to come off of it lead that's that's black and white thinking that i'm talking. jumping to conclusions."
11702.0,Patient,"Yet no, no, no that's not just getting ready to ask you, what do you guys policy on that."
304.0,Provider,"I mean there isn't a policy it's it's specific to each person. individually to each person so so you're getting way ahead, you know your your doses not going down but it's it's getting you to where you are getting used to thinking that you don't need a substance to feel a certain way because that's addiction."
11702.0,Patient,yeah and.
304.0,Provider,"drink that's addiction, I feel, stressed, I want to suboxone."
11702.0,Patient,"Oh go ahead, I heard this chick go to her doctor. J hey I want to ask the box and he talked her out of it, he said. He cried he taking it because the the relapse whatever statistics say that you'll just go right back to doing the other ship. So I want to do this for a period of time, but I don't want to keep getting going downtown ready."
