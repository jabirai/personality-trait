298.0,Provider,"Sure yeah might cancel what does that do exactly that medicine. It is the anti depressant it works on the serotonin receptors in the brain, and so it. It basically what it does in the brain, is it puts a thin little film over the serotonin receptor so you're not so exposed to anxiety when you increase serotonin in the brain you increase your memory you improve your mood. You decrease your anxiety that's the that's pretty much the purpose of serotonin receptor medication, which is what this is."
16806.0,Patient,"Okay. So anxiety um I know when executives, can you give me the definition for anxiety, one more time, please, if you can."
298.0,Provider,"Oh boy that's hard because anxiety it for everybody, it feels different sometimes it can feel like your heart is racing and you have an uneasy feeling, you might feel this inner restlessness you might feel a doom and gloom. Like things are going wrong, and you don't know what it is. there's lots of ways to describe anxiety it's usually a very inner feeling that people can't see but you feel it."
16806.0,Patient,"Right right right okay gotcha. Okay, I guess i'll try that for a little bit, so thank you for sending that again so right after work i'll pick it up on my way my way back home."
