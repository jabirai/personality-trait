741.0,Provider,Where do you live.
17140.0,Patient,We actually just bought our House.
741.0,Provider,All right.
17140.0,Patient,"At the end. of June we signed the papers and they got to move in at the end of July. hey sorry. That all morning she wanted nothing to do with me and no with Matthew I said, be all over you and yeah. And so I live with my fiance we've been together 17 years. we're not quite married, but I guess, we say that we're we're you know we're basically married just without the documentation."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
17140.0,Patient,And then we have a 12 year old son.
741.0,Provider,"Okay okay. And how do you have a religious preference, by any chance."
17140.0,Patient,"I grew up Catholic like I went to St joseph's Catholic school till eighth grade. And, but. After that kind of. we're really good we kind of stopped going to church regularly so. I mean, I still believe in God, but it's not like, I guess, a big part of my life or does that make. It easier."
741.0,Provider,"mm hmm as the part that we as. As addicts tend to neglect actually most of society tends to neglect the nurturing of your spirit. So that's not uncommon. LM have you been in a controlled environment, like in the hospital or in jail or in treatment or something along that line and last there you. Go no no okay. and tell me about your medical history. Any surgeries. Oh hospital visits like overnight."
17140.0,Patient,"c section as surgery. And that's probably about it, no hospitals overnight or anything."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, have you had any broken bones or any chronic diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, any of that."
17140.0,Patient,yeah oh no.
741.0,Provider,All right. So what about are you on any medications.
17140.0,Patient,"um well, I was diagnosed with Depression and anxiety i've been on depression medicine, since. I was like 14 years old. And I was a generic for so long."
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17140.0,Patient,"But I haven't I guess I ran out of medicine and I haven't seen. The lady I was going to see to get more because. Not that I don't want the medication is just I kind of don't really like the Doc does that make sense. I felt like when we would meet she'd be like a will rate your depression right you're it's like she which is fine, but then, when I would tell her like i'm still not getting better you know I feel like i'm still. Not this is helping still she would it's like she wouldn't listen to me does that make sense."
741.0,Provider,yeah yeah mm hmm.
17140.0,Patient,So I guess i'm currently not taking medication for that.
741.0,Provider,"All right, well, and you can always talk to your provider and see yeah Dr Jamie and I don't know. I don't know he's new to bright house i'm not real sure if he's going to prescribe it or you can refer you to the psychiatrist through bright heart house. Does that make sense. So that, but if you if you feel like you need it then yeah but um let's make sure to get it okay. Okay, and because we definitely don't want you to be depressed to know and and. You get to a point where you're unable to function."
17140.0,Patient,Type sutra.
741.0,Provider,And you know.
17140.0,Patient,"Still, what I had to schedule an appointment with him."
741.0,Provider,"And he will actually do a medical follow up with you and and also. You can talk to him during group on Thursday. Okay, you have group on Thursday yeah she did yeah I wanted to."
17140.0,Patient,"When he prescribed me this suboxone. I told it was November 30 I told him. I don't really like suboxone it just I just It makes me like. I get real nauseous and bad headaches. haha and I understand you know you have to go through a protocol and stuff so I I need to talk to him because. When he prescribed it to me and I couldn't get it through the pharmacy out and, if you remember me tell you about the pharmacy like took me three days to get it, I have a friend who gets his prescription for suboxone so I got a few off of him and. Then that thing happened where with my left breast and they did an ultrasound and they said I have like inflammation and they were asking me if it's have I started any new medication and the only thing i've started knew was that suboxone and I don't know if that's what caused my. body to react I don't know so I."
741.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah you need to talk to him about it, I don't know if he's real funny about that. be honest."
17140.0,Patient,Understand like I said I know you guys have a. Protocol and stuff.
741.0,Provider,It has.
17140.0,Patient,"I don't if i'm gonna if he's not gonna. I guess hear what I have to say, or taking I almost feel like what's the point i'll just keep buying somebody checks off the street if it's not get sick does that make sense, you know."
741.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
17140.0,Patient,"I don't i'm trying to not try to be a pain in the ass or anything and I like I said I know. She like he's like I said, people abuse it so i'm not trying to be one of those person or anything I just I don't know I just told him, it makes me sick and."
741.0,Provider,"If it if it gives you headaches and it makes you see a summit, and then you had inflammation that had been created and then that was the only thing different. than it may be now. I will say this, he may ask you to go to one of those Doc in the box places and get them to write a letter stating that or to your primary care physician stating that you have a had an allergic reaction to it. And that point he has no choice but to change it. Okay um. So yeah I understand that that. he's the only one that i've run into that has been that that adamant about it. But. there's ways to deal with it, you know. yeah because I seriously believe that if if you went in and you had inflammation that came about, and the only thing that was different was the medicine, then chances are that medicine is probably what's causing the issue. Yes, so. um. So yeah let's make sure that we discussed that and in group tomorrow. And, or at least tell him that you need a medical follow up. appointment with him. Because. You need to discuss your medication. Okay, so one of the two if you're not comfortable discussing it in the open forum like that, then you can schedule an appointment with him to follow up on that. um. So in in in your family history like your mom and dad and grandparents and all that stuff do they have any medical issues cancer, diabetes, heart disease any of that stuff."
17140.0,Patient,"Yes, my mom well she has Ms. Okay, and then my dad. Is bipolar has high blood pressure. And then my grandmother on my mom's side, she had breast cancer. My dad's parents, they had. alzheimer's both and my dad's dad had heart disease, because he had a heart attack."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, I so there's some medical history in the family. That could affect you in the long run okay and what's the highest grade she completed in school."
17140.0,Patient,I completed high school and I did some college.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have any specialized training or technical education."
17140.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"No Okay, and do you have a driver's license. Yes, okay and and, what is your longest full time job."
17140.0,Patient,"and probably before I had my right of. Probably before I had my son, because after I had him, I became a stay at home mom. Okay, and then, when he got a little older I started working again a doctor's office as a receptionist but. The problem was. I had no one else to watch my does that add No one to babysit for me so when I would take him to the daycare and he got a fever and I couldn't take him back to daycare because they said, you have to wait 24 hours. I was still in my beginning of 90 days of that job, so the lady who hired me she kind of made it known like, if you want to stay here you got to basically get it figured out, so I kind of left that because. I didn't want to be put in another situation like that or have them deal, you know, like."
741.0,Provider,Right yeah.
17140.0,Patient,Over. yeah I.
741.0,Provider,Think you're going to be there for.
17140.0,Patient,"yeah yeah exactly and plus well. My mom's Ms she was diagnosed, I think, in her late 20s but it didn't really start to sector till my son was about three years old, she had to stop driving because she couldn't move her leg fast enough to break so she almost got into a car accident. So, on top of being a stay at home mom I also take her to her doctor's visits her a physical therapy or do her groceries do."
741.0,Provider,Anything yeah.
17140.0,Patient,I do so.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've that. you've got elder care and child care doing both. yeah kind of like a sandwich thing that talk about. Okay, so. you're not really looking to go back and learn either."
17140.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean, I said, you know my son he's. In sixth grade now, but I would have no one to pick them up from school take him to school, it is kind of hard to find a job that will go around those hours."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
17140.0,Patient,"cuz my Chris he works full time, so he you know, and I don't really trust my dad he rather be at a bar, then so of course i'm not going to trust him picking my friends either."
741.0,Provider,"Right exactly okay all right so. y'all are not married, but you are married kind of. meeting together for 17 years right that's that's. A long time. yeah is there any alcoholism or drug abuse on your mom's side of the family."

741.0,Provider,"What about your dad's. Yes, okay. You said, your dad right. Yes, okay anybody at grant his parents are aunts or uncles."
17140.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so I know his grandfather. I guess killed himself so there's some mental it a lot of mental issues on his side I just don't know if they were ever really properly diet, you know diagnosed."

741.0,Provider,Okay. and tell me about your relationship with your mom what's your relationship with her like.
17140.0,Patient,"it's very good. I think we're kind of codependence that makes sense. And that's probably not that healthy so either because. Even like her, and my dad have just over the years I don't know why she puts up with him still you know, and I mean she even got had a mental breakdown from. The verbal emotional abuse and had to be put into psychiatry's hospital and for her to even still take him back after that I think I still have a lot of resentment even towards him. But yeah I still if he's still needs to be I still do it. Like help him and I know that makes no sense to other people, you know."
741.0,Provider,Sure dad.
17140.0,Patient,yeah and that's what I said.
741.0,Provider,"huh how, what is your relationship like, with your dad."
17140.0,Patient,"We don't talk regularly it's like only when we see each other. Like when my mom was in the hospital, a few years ago, like that was the most we talked daily because he was calling because he could never seem to get a hold of her also I think they didn't want him to speak with her, you know because of it, so he would call me asking if I heard about. How, you know and stuff like that. right but it's kind of when I see him that, when we talk and even then it's still awkward we never really had a relationship really I don't."
741.0,Provider,"You kind of have as. kind of hard to have a relationship with somebody who drink. I don't know about you, but my dad drank and he come home from work and pass out so yeah I mean, how do you have a relationship with somebody like that."

17140.0,Patient,"it's good, I think it could be better on my part, I tend to. Like a lot and I think that has to do with like my depression or even my drug use, I think cuz if I was going through withdrawals. I didn't want to die would cancel or make is you know."

17140.0,Patient,"I think when i'm more honest with my family and friends and. cuz. I was. I opened up about doing this program and I guess, they were all surprised because they thought I was doing good and I, because I was keeping it from them. Right so to kind of not having to hide that anymore trying for the. lifted up some way."
741.0,Provider,I bet I bet it's hard to keep track of all the lies isn't it.
17140.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and so your willingness to be honest and with the people in your life and what would you say some of the challenges are. To recovery."
17140.0,Patient,"um temptation I get there, even if you're having a good day you still wanna. it's mostly when you're stressed out and having a bad day I want to use, but sometimes even having a good day i'm like hey i've been doing good it's like let's celebrate yeah."
741.0,Provider,"Right exactly exactly okay. All right, so and are you influenced by the people around you about with regard to using. OK. And OK, so if your family supportive of your recovery. Yes, okay okay and. So if you had to say that you had that you had a couple of goals, what would those goals be."
17140.0,Patient,"To stop. Making plans and then canceling them. I want to be. I don't know what the word is, I guess, reliable, you know."
741.0,Provider,Have integrity.
17140.0,Patient,You know.
741.0,Provider,"yeah. You want to have integrity. yeah you want to develop some integrity. Okay, what else."
17140.0,Patient,um to stop 100% is the purpose.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
17140.0,Patient,"Because I know it might only be like twice a month, but i'd still use it."
741.0,Provider,"You know it's day exactly. So actively in your addiction. Using opioids. Okay, what about other drugs. Like alcohol or nicotine any of that stuff you."
17140.0,Patient,"Alcohol for me is more like occasionally like family get togethers I know. They I I don't have a problem with alcohol, so I guess it doesn't really bother me that much. Because I don't like I said I don't really drink that often it's basically around I think this thanksgiving and Christmas time is the time I only drink and that's like a glass of wine is that."
741.0,Provider,"Right right. Well, let me, let me pose a question for. You okay. Use quit using the percocet completely. Okay. Now you don't have that crutch."
17140.0,Patient,yeah oh.
741.0,Provider,And you drink a drink or maybe two. Because you're substituting it for the percocet does that make.
17140.0,Patient,sense it does make sense.
741.0,Provider,"And then, once you do that. For a while your inhibitions become lowered. And you're like hmm I want what I really want. So. You move back to doing what you want to do."
17140.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,that's the reason that we. suggest that you don't use alcohol.
17140.0,Patient,don't drink okay.
741.0,Provider,"Not to mention it combines with the medicine. Okay. If you're taking an Anti, especially if we get you back on an antidepressant and you're taking the the suboxone or the 70 tix mixing that with the alcohol is not a good thing. Both of those medications mix with alcohol can produce not pretty results. So. and, especially, that was not something that that's that important and, like, for me, I had a taste of it, just like Why am I even bothering to drink it. So and. Okay, so we want to develop some integrity want to stop using opioids and. Those are good places to start. And we can start and. I thought, if you don't mind i'm going to send you an email and that's going to have a worksheet attached to it. And the worksheet is what would my ideal life look like. You can think about. What is it that you want your life to look like. yeah, what are we going to work toward and that'll also help you figure out. Maybe a little bit more about what you really want and what you really want to change about yourself so um, but we can start working with it and integrity and stop using. Second okay. yeah and you have any other questions."
17140.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"Okay well just so that you know I i'm i'm sure you can tell, by the way, I talk that I am I also am a recovering addict I have 15 years clean and sober 10 of those years i've been a counselor. Well, congratulations, thank you, I started using when I was about 12 years. Old and so, and by the time I was 16 I was a full blown addict. I quit using for a period of about 13 years, but it was horrible and I wanted to use every day. yeah every single day event 13 years and, finally, I gave up and relapse. And this time. I asked God to remove the desire to use, I mean I literally screamed out. And the next morning when I got up that desire to use it was gone and it has not returned. And i've been very blessed. yeah so. that's a little bit about me i'm not going to ask you to do a bunch of stuff that I wouldn't have already done. just saying now a lot of times. People look at me crazy like are you really serious. And it's like you know what. I did it and it were."
17140.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,I don't know how and I don't know why I just know I did it and it works. So do it try it see if it works.
17140.0,Patient,"um I okay you didn't tell me if I, but the first group that we had last Thursday. Yes, and I don't want to be like talking about the other people in it, so if I be an out of line, you can tell me there was one woman that she just didn't look like she was there during the meeting, if that makes any sense."
741.0,Provider,"yeah she looks like she's nodding. Does yes. Yes, yes, I can and that's and that can be a trigger. issue for her. And she has she is just two polar opposite drugs. Okay, and right now she's traveling the most with math. So when she doesn't have the math she has no energy to get up and go. yeah Okay, and the, but when she doesn't take her i'm sorry suboxone. Then. She is and she goes into craving. and withdraw sometimes and stuff like that so."
17140.0,Patient,"yeah and i've got like I I don't want to sell me by saying this, it just. tasted and it's like yeah let me know. yeah well."
741.0,Provider,"I, and I understand that and that also has. A lot of people. I know even the doctors like. up. But that's that's really. it's a function of the of the fact that she took. On two different. Things I used to do I didn't do medicine. and heroin I did heroin and coke. same same thing. Right. So what did you stop doing them. There is a slow motion effect. You have a hard time staying awake and staying focused and. yeah, especially if you've got opioid replacement in your system. So that's that's really what's going on. i'm gonna work on trying to get something I you know I don't know i'm working with her and hopefully it will get better."
17140.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah nice with your ex. I totally understand i'm not like. Trying to judge or anything or.
741.0,Provider,"Now, but it's okay to talk about the fact that it triggers you."
17140.0,Patient,yeah so.
741.0,Provider,So yeah that makes perfect sense and that's okay. Her behavior is triggering for some people. yeah so. um. So go ahead and keep talking about it with me now. Okay okay.
17140.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"All right, anything else."
