14225.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Not an accident on fire.
14225.0,Patient,"I mean, for the most part, I would think so it's when I think about the accident and then, it gives me anxiety and then I think about the future and it gives me depression and then. it's kind of like a cycle like that I would say."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. let's talk about Tom okay. i'm going to share my screen with you. we're going to talk about what it is. So trauma is a powerful emotional response to a distressing evening such a war and accident, the unexpected loss of a loved one or abuse trauma can continue to call both emotional and physical samples for many years after the event has concluded right so everything miss you feeling. is normal. Mostly evidence of the trauma that occurs. Some of the risk factors of trauma is a traumatic experience with unexpected. Right. You didn't expect to fall off will fall off a window."
14225.0,Patient,"Yes, like this is."
740.0,Provider,"The victim has experienced by a strong. The experience happened repeatedly or over a long period of time, the farm occurred during childhood feeling of helplessness doing the experience. The victim of dealing with other major stressors are related to the travel. So these are just some of the respect. So symptoms of trauma everyone's experience with trauma is unique. Some people were developed every sentence, while others develop very few. The following list of sentences not comprehensive and should not be used the former diagnose i'm not trying to diagnose you okay we're just kind of go we're going to go ready just to kind of inform you what what trauma looks like. Here says avoidance of trauma reminders including memories so doing things to kind of avoid the reminders right deterring yourself trying to distract yourself or also some people in times past had activity of what happened never happened. Okay flashback remember you saying about the players bank. flashback to the traumatic event, so the thing about it is, I think, at one point you denied trauma, but you say fly, and when you do not nightmare for that matter, i'm sorry, would you deny nightmares but you said that you do hit flashback and so flashbacks also. is a symptom of the trauma. yeah crime. exaggerated spotter responses. distressing dreams and obviously problems irritability anger and other negative emotion that blame regarding determine if you've been. So that is the question that I do want to actually do you blame yourself, for what happened to you."
14225.0,Patient,"I try not to, but if I think about to the day I mean I wish I wouldn't have been next to the window and slipped you know I mean there's not much I could have done, but it's."
740.0,Provider,it's hard not to.
14225.0,Patient,It I could have done something different.
740.0,Provider,So were you on a roof like world where you.
14225.0,Patient,"know, I was it was just a ground floor and I was playing ping pong and it was a hardwood floor and I played there for years and I just slipped back could my arm out and broke through the window and then, when I pulled it out and just ripped it up and cut it really bad."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, so you will play next to the window."
14225.0,Patient,yeah so the window is right behind me. slip back.
740.0,Provider,"yeah okay makes it makes it okay. Alright, from treatments of treating trauma they have cognitive behavior therapy, you have exposure therapy medication and they do have other treatment as well. So I just kind of wanted to go over really fast what it is okay, because sometimes sometimes. What i've discovered in time passes, that people don't have an actual definition of what trauma is, but I want you to know their trauma is normal and a half and say everybody. Everybody is recovering from some kind of trauma right, it is very trauma is very broad, but it's different from it is different for everybody. Right so. What I wanted to ask you, was what are some what are some way you cope with your when you feel anxious, or when you feel worried about the future or more, you see away you. see your current situation where you are now not be able to be employed you're just really being denied and then nasty you're trying to find a job, but at the same time we're going to match your hand, so what, how do you cultivate."
14225.0,Patient,"um I go on walks and. Video games for sure. Is a good coping methods for me. Other than that i'm trying my hardest to apply, you know as much as possible, so i'm trying to keep my mind occupied but trying to apply for a job that well I guess the fine with me i'm in when i'm."
740.0,Provider,"Oh. alright. These are called worry coping cards. How to help you cope when you're worried. And, of course. And you're right I can't. put myself in your shoes I can't imagine what you're going through, but understand that sometimes you can't help but worried because of the current situation, which you were in. Right so that's something that I do understand. Okay, so what i'm trying to do it now, because you said you go on a walk and you play video games. We will have to broaden that out, so I have to add more to that could be eventually."
14225.0,Patient,You know your games can get out.
740.0,Provider,Especially when you need. To have So how do you hold the controller now yeah with both hands or how do you do that.
14225.0,Patient,"Though I kind of adapt. yeah i'm able to do it, I hold it with one hand and then use the other hand, to move on in the sticks."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so let me ask you this, if I can, if I may. um. So I know you're not able to move your left hand right yeah but are you able to use to have the move of your fingers. No okay so so the nerve nerve that completely gone to your hand."
14225.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, what can you say move your arm."
14225.0,Patient,"yeah I can move my arm like that. Okay, but as far as a hand I can just move it like that. I can lose my hand or anything like that."
740.0,Provider,"But you can see, you have some kind of movement, so there is some kind of movement. yeah."
14225.0,Patient,"I mean there's still hope in the future, I mean."
740.0,Provider,yeah i'm putting every day that I can.
14225.0,Patient,"regain more function. Right okay surgeries as well, but."
740.0,Provider,Not permanently damaged you. know not function. Some leaving.

740.0,Provider,"yeah okay so because, when I was like let me a because i'm thinking that okay so without a lamp we can't do nothing like if you if you live. But yeah that's the case you know. You have."
14225.0,Patient,"Some financial one one, because I can there's three nerves in your arm I cut two of them, so. When it works, and then you can do 10 and transfers which helped the other ones."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good do good yeah i'm all right, these are some of the healthy skills Peggy breath. breathing exercises, do you ever do that."
14225.0,Patient,yeah when i'm outside sometimes I try to meditate the best.
740.0,Provider,They do they work. They work.
14225.0,Patient,"Sometimes, sometimes it for some reason brings me more anxiety. If I focus on my breathing you know. But sometimes it does help."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so we'll we'll scratch their went off."
14225.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"All right, so it says to stop and listen so when you're walking in nature. Do you ever kind of stop or kind of hone in to the nation noises around you."
14225.0,Patient,I do yeah.
740.0,Provider,Did they bring you any kind of comfort at all any kind of relaxation listening to the birds listening to the water listening to world or whatever the when.
14225.0,Patient,It definitely does.
740.0,Provider,So nature know a detailed.
14225.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Is it possible, just asking, is it possible to pull up nature noises on YouTube and allow those days to play during your meditative state."
14225.0,Patient,yeah that's definitely possible.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so we have nature knows that so there's nation noises calm you like, do you ever feel anxiety or worried or any kind of depressive symptoms doing doing the time we have your nature walks being able to listen to nature."
14225.0,Patient,I mean it's it's hard to thing to every time they usually I would say no.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good so we got to bring light for that one so nice to know. Okay, video that came on. I don't know how you feel about drawing how you feel about drawing."
14225.0,Patient,"I mean neutral, I could dry."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. don't say physically draw yoweri. But I would say tracks of mentally you draw your word what does it look like imagine what you're worried looks like. Okay, so in this moment I would just say kind of use that imagery. So don't inconvenience yourself and trying to draw out where we, as you can do it in your mind. So when you draw out or when you imagine your worry in your mind or another imagery so be picturing a. An animal that match is your where we in the moment."
14225.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"So. And featuring the animal, and that was about the top of the dollar my bare bones. As i'm picturing picturing an animal, so this is what I will say, I will say picture a worry animal and then future a people animal. Okay, all right. and and So picture worry animal event future peaceful animal and then figuring out how to go from one to the other. So when you're in worry like say they have. um. I guess I I will, I will say this, for example, i'll use this one event for me, so I think about a worry animal our think about an otter. And all the reason why we think about an autumn, because of course they're in the ground. But animals, they actually. A. look out what not what is the word they actually. Have famous price. Right, I remember once I was looking on a on an animal channel, I know I know I was a new channels and I think if otter I think I think, because the cost but also going to animal channel and when they come out of their whole. Other animals actually look for them are actually hot for them it's pretty so they are chase them down. And so they will lose your chase them down, and so the auto the auto accident have to go back into the hole, and I have seen animals be through the holes to try to give. To them."
14225.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And so, if I have to imagine my worry animal will be honest, because they're always basically trying to protect themselves from getting eaten, and so, when they come out of the hole they always have to worry about am I going to live today or am I going to be eating today. So that will be my worry I am. A peaceful animal. I will you, for example, could be um. I guess i'm the one the main thing that comes to mind is an eagle. And all the reason why same eagle. One of the things that I realized about the eagle is that they fly higher than every other birds. Another thing about the ego is that it is there is one of it is, it is a very, very strong invincible time bird like an eagle is what destroys everybody already here about eagles get storm out of the birds. And so, our say other people, and all the reason and that's the thing, and the reason why we choose the eagle is because of the fact. That is a fly like it just seemed that they will you look at an eagle is is one of strength is one of his seemed as if they can be invincible against other birds not other animals but of birth. So that's an example so find out or identify use of imagery and regard so that means you have to apply have to look at Okay, so how can I be from a worry otter to a peaceful eagle. Does that make sense."
14225.0,Patient,"That does, how would you go about in your head making that transition."
740.0,Provider,"So I would I would use you self talk honestly I would ask myself, our actually asked myself. What. What am I what am I. What am I worried about today. And I will kind of lose my worry. Right, so if i'm a worry otter my NGO an otter canisters worried as am I going to live today, am I going to find food today, am I going to be somebody prays in Missouri be somebody to pray today, am I going to be able to run out run my predators today right. um you know, am I going to be able to dig fast today, am I going to be able to make it back to the whole that I did the first time. Or you know where, am I going to find a safety today, if I am price so that's a lot of words. Right. But for how do I flip it flip the about reframing. My thoughts, so when I asked the question is, when I asked the question of. Am I going to be safe, today, the actual reframe that by saying. you're going to do everything in your power to be fast today. Or if i'm going to be worried about. Am I going to be able to make it back who the hell that does today for protection. To alleviate their worry i'm going to make sure that I have a rat in place. So, you know how they used to say. For when you have a fire alarm, I mean we have a fire of fire drill we do the fire drill you have a mark, are you."
14225.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Right, and so what I would do to leave your myself about work from worrying if i'm going to make it back say one hole what I would do is that doing my protection time. I would actually go and be pretty home around my facility so that even back a mega back to that one I know for a fact that I do that i'm able to be safe, because i've already made sure that i've made provisions to be safe."
14225.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense.
740.0,Provider,"Right so that's what I mean so that's how we transition from that, and so the more I transition, I mean the more I reframe those worry question, then I can find myself calming down the more I find myself coming down the more i'm able to be at peace. And then, of course, when i'm able to be a piece, then my image transitions from aware other to that will people equal."
14225.0,Patient,Okay. yeah yeah.
740.0,Provider,i'm favorite place. So it makes it your favorite place.
14225.0,Patient,yeah yeah it could say that.
740.0,Provider,I mean music.
14225.0,Patient,Inside is. You know.
740.0,Provider,Do you have a favorite place in your House.
14225.0,Patient,Probably my room. Okay yeah.
740.0,Provider,So that's your ultimate favorite place.
14225.0,Patient,"My ultimate favorite place in my room, no, I would say more outside."
740.0,Provider,Okay yeah is there a certain location outside like is there a certain trail you like to walk. Is there a certain like you like to visit.
14225.0,Patient,yeah there's a right next to my house there's a cool trail.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. So that's also. We have that we have been there. Right, so we have nature noisy. We have imagery. And we have a favorite player. Who writing a happy ending. What do you think that may."
14225.0,Patient,Just writing probably the best case scenario for for my future.
740.0,Provider,"yep so instead of looking at what might not happen or worrying about what you can't do. it's being able to like you say identify or write out the best scenario of what. Of what could possibly happen or what could happen, instead of worrying about what you can't do it just identify the things you can do. And still be successful, it is possible, I know, a man right now. I think it's mainly ag ag Jones the ag Germany some like a right he used to be a professional football player injured his own, to the point to where he can move it out. He can move his same. became move nothing he wraps it up that's how much he can't use it. Right um and it literally it just stay by your side, and sometimes he holds it. Right, but he can't move it out it's completely be."
14225.0,Patient,"Well yeah he probably injured, the nurse."
740.0,Provider,"yeah is gone right and it stays wrapped up in like a little white ramp. And that's it. But he did not allow it to get him down. And so, one of the passions that he was able to one of the passion that he was able to manifest or able to. I can't think of the word, engaging I gave. His motivation speaking. Encouraging building them up, because in a moment, when he was in his lowest place that's what he did for himself. And so, he realized that if he was able to if he was able to build himself up self top pushing himself. Right, let me see you they he said okay with this, the skill that I that I have so i'm able to do this for myself, then there are other people as well, who are able to who may also benefit from the same from the same motivation, so now. he's up there with some of the great motivation speakers. striving to be the number one motivational speaker in the world. Right traveling around the country. going to different places do motivational speaking and his name is he I think his name is Avi think this would have named me. Let me, let me make sure, because I don't want to say anything you will look at them blind people are black and. i'm proud to say like there are changes made it a try to encourage me know. yeah as inky I am K y nt Johnson. i'm gonna pull them up put them up for you right now hold on, let me pull them up for you. So you can see i'm not playing."
14225.0,Patient,"Well, I believe you."
740.0,Provider,"alone. And i'm going to show you. That, if he can you can. All right, let me share my screen with you. Okay, so. that's what it all looks like right now. that's what it looks like. Right, so when he he's beautiful lovely. We had a bad injury right here. Whenever to move it so now. he's it is called ink inspiration it's all in inspirations. Right and it's man he's a motivational speaker. Here they are wasn't about. Football career is over. This is it where's it all. wrapped up. not able to move it is completely cannot move. jealousy moves with other one. i'll Let me move like this it cannot move theory So you see, right here, it says, I by his side."
14225.0,Patient,yeah it's. So tough injury right there.
740.0,Provider,"yeah but you see he did not stop him. Here you have them receiving reward. For motivational speaking again he got associate all and see that on if they layer i'm on your side, but guess what I got another own."
14225.0,Patient,True.
740.0,Provider,"So it's the same thing, the thing about a baby. i'm just saying. They right now, it doesn't look like an ideal situation. But at the same time, look at the body fat of what you can steal just."
14225.0,Patient,True.
740.0,Provider,He don't have no function at out. You can feel least moved your. He can move nothing.
14225.0,Patient,yeah. So movement.
740.0,Provider,"yeah and so just find a reason to be grateful and but the thing, what I want to say is that you can still be successful, even with even with your hand being the way it is this May last hour filming his on a he's still able to be one of the top motivational speakers in the world."
14225.0,Patient,And so.
740.0,Provider,"that's one so and he has a YouTube channel so anytime you feel like you need a little pick me up. All you gotta do. Is go to his YouTube channel. Go to YouTube type typing inky I in ky john. And he actually has a video on there. called tragedy into triumph. where he kind of tell us his story, and he has what i'll sort of says, you are graded they your circumstances in pain, I find strange. So he has a lot of different videos on there, so I wanted to at least encourage you with a."
14225.0,Patient,yeah I mean that's it it's a great example with the similar injury.
740.0,Provider,"yeah that I want to least encourage you, we say that you can still be great you can still be successful, you can still do whatever it is that you desire to do whatever you whatever you can do you can still do that you are not. You are not destroyed. and think about it is one thing is. Is that he doesn't expect that he's handicap that's not what he said because that's not what it is you're saying he had injuries. And the thing about it is he's able, he was able to overcome it and still be able to still an impact so many other people because, like you say this this fire this though got the same. But he is is way worse and he's still able to be great he feel like with the strap but his dream stealers to have a family as his own he does have a family, he has a whole family, he has a wife and two keys of boy and a girl. And, and never stopped them no never stops from my one time."
14225.0,Patient,yeah no that's inspiring I mean. I definitely agree with that statement it's just hard to find yeah find that passion to to you know what I mean.
740.0,Provider,"And, and the thing about it, if it takes time and that's why I say one or the other resources that you can also use like it's going, since you know that his injury is similar to yours just go into his YouTube page and typing in I in ky genesis and see how he was able to motivate himself. yeah and to see some of the things that he would some of the tools and some of the fields that he was able to utilize as the best something that you can do that, you can utilize as well, one of the best experiences, I mean one of the best of one of the best features. is being able to learn from other people's experiences and how they would have a was able to overcome maybe historic can help you know i'm saying push you and motivate you. to fulfill your stores and to see the best possible ending or to see the best possible scenario scenario. So. let's go back to our record."
14225.0,Patient,This is.
740.0,Provider,"Our word coping skills, I would say. Well, the last one, we have left. Is journaling. What do you think about it."
14225.0,Patient,"I don't do it, but I mean i'm open to it, if you think it's helpful."
740.0,Provider,Okay. um. And all the reason why that i'ma leave that up to you. Because the only reason why I wouldn't say journaling. in regards to writing down your sorrows because you are ready to perfect the day.
14225.0,Patient,yeah but.
740.0,Provider,"I would say, maybe a. Like i'm trying to see like a rename it something else. Like a sustained how about a lack of success plan identifying short and long term goals of things that you can still accomplish and then making a plan of how you can achieve it."
14225.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"So. We can do is like it we just say like this, like a success of the six money. Making long term long term and short term goals of what you want to accomplish and the plan and making plans of how you want to how you want how how you are going to achieve you. can contact today, for some reason i'm sorry."
14225.0,Patient,yeah no worries.
740.0,Provider,"um so yeah we'll leave it at that. Oh yeah so basically it is just kind of giving a description, but we kind of what our so let's go. So we'll leave it at that. So I hope that you were able to take something away from this session today. to at least kind of give you a bit of perspective, then life is not over, just because you have an injury."
14225.0,Patient,"True true it's just finding that the new found. Open yeah some inspiration and ways to to kind of cope with it, when I feel that way."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and so this is what I would encourage you to do i'm not even gonna lie to you, Andrew this one, I would encourage us to do.

740.0,Provider,"If you feel like is not right for you, then please let us know either later either let mistakes now. If you feel like their group isn't right for you, then, when she acts like hey Angela how's everything going blah blah blah after we finished with the group, if you feel like it's not right for you, then let her know and then we'll see about.

So are a lot of people, a lot of people they struggle with the same thing anxiety that's, why is it is a an anxiety based group. yeah but, again, if you feel like hey I don't think you I don't think it's the right fit that's fine make sure you vocalize that and being. will see my transition you somewhere else, but at least see give it a few classes first and then decide after you've been in the group at least a few times. Okay okay."
