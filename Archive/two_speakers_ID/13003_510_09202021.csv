510.0,Provider,"Now, what are you know, and you did say that earlier, so I let yeah let's talk about the coping strategies. That you are trying to do, because some of this, I mean as horrific as it all is you, you do not have control over it. you've done the pieces that you have done around the legal which I really applaud that was a big part of our last conversation so i'm so glad you followed through with that. What are you doing to cope, and just really attend to yourself and kind of manage your own mental health because you're you're getting pulled in a lot of directions. What are you doing that's helping."
13003.0,Patient,"Well, obviously one of these. Big is a scary now that I have was going with it is, and I hate to say this medication other Prozac in the cloud in the pts DJ and he said I didn't realize, I was fighting my sleep."
510.0,Provider,"As a new one, let me go to your medication I can't hear I knew you're on the Prozac. But let me just quickly check. quantum and the process and it's it's used off label to help with nightmares night terrors is that a newer one for you joy."
13003.0,Patient,yeah i've never had it we're. feeling. I feel it burnt shooting sleep now I don't.
510.0,Provider,feel embarrassed.
13003.0,Patient,"So that's a big. Help because I were down, I was."
510.0,Provider,"yeah no that's huge because if you're not sleeping. that's going to really impact your mood, which is going to impact it's going to be like a cascade right on where you're just sort of always playing catch up so Okay, so you are sleeping like how many hours of sleep, are you getting her night."
13003.0,Patient,about each night.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, oh yeah. that's definitely much better okay."
13003.0,Patient,"And I didn't realize, I was 20, and I mean and. You know, he said, I was starting to like when I was sleeping so I was not sleeping I was."
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13003.0,Patient,"i'd be down up down anyway, I did finally get sleepy so solid that. My body would eight because I would say, like one position where everybody's kind of finally gave up like for now. And i've been writing a lot. that's a big government i've always used. To suddenly suddenly to sell out loud it's a very, very, very angry. and write it down third way some things I keep and some things you know, on your personal journey, I think. is best read the person i'm addressing it too. Because I do have some anger issues I do toward Steve especially. and Not not not regenerated course but. Steve manly em and are the other women it's just like when is enough enough."
510.0,Provider,"Goodness yes, now I mean. Are you wanting some girls for couples therapy are you at a place or I i'm thinking, maybe just individual which i'm going to need to talk to you a little bit about my status but i'm wondering if. You just kind of work individually. But we can always get you some referrals for couples therapy I guess i'm curious. You had mentioned like that to him, but what's what's your pulse on that as far as wanting to start that."
13003.0,Patient,"We have to, because this is the here's the problem okay I didn't share announced 14 years ago. or something man three times you tried it off. He says that now he submits woman before that and i've only done one time when manage it. I realized how much I did not love my husband, I had a mistake i've made. I didn't realize how much I loved him into I did that, and then I was scared to death of losing because I love you I do love me. But he and some of them beforehand and that's what started to all the China my angry feelings towards the resentment and because we didn't address it well, he decided by i'm gonna tell you everything and i'm like Okay, this is like now you're not enough, I see and. But he says, I wouldn't turn it, he will he will own it you won't."
510.0,Provider,know some silly okay yeah and I don't know if i'll own IT and therapy I just that's why i'm sort of.
13003.0,Patient,"to argue with them here to you. Because he says, well, I would have done it I wouldn't have been that situation, if you would have done that no Steve you have a choice, I had a choice and I made the wrong one you have choices you definitely made her over and. Over and over and over again."
510.0,Provider,"Well yeah it's not like a one time there's been. Multiple affairs he's a serial this is serial behavior right. This isn't a one off. i'm Okay, I mean i'm happy to have case that we have a case management department, if you want. Some couples therapy referrals we certainly can send this out to you I didn't know how quickly you are wanting. To do that, because you have a lot on your plate, but if that is something really pressing and you're wanting to do i'm happy to support you to know I just I don't want you spread so thin. But if you think that would be a good step to kind of really try to dig in yes. Because obviously it's it's a huge. it's a huge issue right now going on, and it was a huge issue we've only met for your intake. Because it sounds like it's even magnified now that he's like disclosing all this stuff it's like Okay, we need some more structured guidance here."
13003.0,Patient,"Right, because I think you'd be better off because you know I need a partner, I can rely on 100%. No matter at all. Because you know that has has not going to cut it and or it sure everything's your fault, no it's not my fault, we all have choices in life, and you had you had to own what you do."
510.0,Provider,yeah oh absolutely joy that and as a as a given and i'm not hearing any responsibility of what he's like nothing.
13003.0,Patient,"And not hearing anything, or he says i'm sorry I hurt you well that's a blanket statement and then this I didn't."
510.0,Provider,know.
13003.0,Patient,"Well i'm sorry that you know I didn't know. If you own it I can forgive you for it, but you can't I can't review."
510.0,Provider,"yeah and what what I mean and i'm sure this is crossed your mind like what do you want to see happen, you know the reality is just because you go into family or couples therapy doesn't necessarily mean. The outcome is going to be you to remain together, are you prepared for the potential. It just doesn't work and you and you will always have the choice. Whether you know really to engage and remain in the marriage, because it sounds like you're reaching a tipping point of we need some support here, I need some support because this isn't working."
13003.0,Patient,"yeah that point where it's a decision to be made either you're going to my husband hundred percent Facebook and just it's 5050 partner not. Not not not described I can't do this, this is where it's you know, a partnership to help you build you build yourself up not tear you down and. down and that's river."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and when everything else swirling around you. You need sort of that stability and the the marriage, but at the same time, you know when you start couples work, sometimes it gets sort of destabilized and I just I don't want to add to it, but it sounds like you're really you're ready to sort of dig in. Because this isn't working anymore."
13003.0,Patient,"Okay yeah because I need to take, because to me, I mean my family, my home that's that's first and foremost, just and I can deal with. that's one step at a time, but right now. My whole life has to be stable i've got to know. who's who's got my back and who doesn't know my back. I don't have the time or the and i'm not 15 years old i'm not chasing around town it's done."
510.0,Provider,"it's just yeah. I hear you joy, well, I will how about with your approval i'll go ahead and request case management to send me some referrals within your network, obviously with whatever health insurance, you have within your zip Code as well. So we'll we'll send you some I applaud you, you know, doing the the The self care and taking the strategies that we I know we've talked about but also getting the legal console. And I I just I know that is terrifying that you had to sort of wait until there's some sort of contact. We talked about safety planning has there been any other discussion with your husband or just on your own around safety planning and kind of being very, very mindful of you know, when this date comes and what you, you can do to protect yourself."
13003.0,Patient,"i'm kind of i'm mainly me my daughter she talked and Steve. Steve did purchase another gun, just in case and it's put up just the case and. And my daughters they're getting acquainted see on lessons, also because they don't not operate again, so I don't want him to around you guys that they don't know anything about so and that's just. My window there's already been a safe eclipse days in one area that doesn't sit well with with the daughter and. she's another area. So that, and you know we're putting extra locks in in the windows. Okay, so because she's she says like she knows, and she said, six months give him six months mom he said contact you until six months after he's out. he's gonna want to party, a little bit then he's gonna be a pest she was I know this man and she's been a long time so she's like and then they'll contact you. So they said any means contact you through somebody else. yeah I guess gpu so she."
510.0,Provider,"Good good I you know, and she probably does know him, but this sort of personality and this behavior it's unpredictable. Around need to be prepared for he'll contact you on day one, you know contact you on day two it doesn't matter yes. keep that in the back your mind, but I want you to kind of just be this point you're going to have to be vigilant, just because of the scenario you do know and understand the strategies that you take, which is good. yeah i'm the legal standpoint okay. And it sounds like."
13003.0,Patient,The safes and the guns and I know.
510.0,Provider,"You have licenses and just being very. Aware of that you know the safety aspect, along with your mental health right you don't want anything to jeopardize, especially with the conflict potential conflict going on with you and your husband. I just want you to save joy that's all."
13003.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. As he's not road so i've always been here alone and so yours has some kind of weapon here, no matter what. No, I wouldn't need be my ever been mad enough. Somebody to be like Okay, I want to shoot you it's just just, just in case like just that might you know i'm saying we're so. physically turning."
510.0,Provider,"up with joy, I hear you I hear you and you already had to do at once, like."
13003.0,Patient,I.
510.0,Provider,"And I understand the context in which you are, unfortunately, the position you were in and you did the right thing you are protecting yourself your family and that's that's huge okay. um so I don't think Julie. share this with you and i'm so sorry I missed seeing you, I think we had appointed last week I am so I need to provide you a little bit of update by by my status. But the end of August I actually notified burkhardt and had tendered my resignation and I began notifying my caseload on September 1 second and third, and then I had a very unanticipated family emergency and I was out all of the six through the 10th. And so i've been notifying my caseload upon return last week, and this was, I think you got rescheduled and i'm so sorry.

And just so you know that's a common question, I still am not been told, who is going to be taking over all my cases. But since we're going to hopefully talk next week i'm hopeful, because my last day i'm hopeful, I have a name, because my last day is October 1 I had given 30 days notice. But obviously it's the 20th and I haven't been able to see you so i'm so glad you were in session today i'm so remind me when you have group, because I can't unfortunately see on the same day, you have group."

Oh sorry your Eastern time so I have a. 430 year time or I have a 7:30pm your time I do, whether you want the fourth day I also have a morning on Friday, but it sounds like the afternoon one works yeah Okay, so that will be just to say it out loud again Thursday September 30 at 430 Eastern time. And i'll get that entered into the calendar just check in just like you did today and that will be our final session, but at least that'll give one more touch point. Before the care navigators begin to outreach you once the new therapist has been identified, my guests, as I hopefully we'll have a name to give you next week joy."
13003.0,Patient,I do the legal.
510.0,Provider,prescriber though in your group will still be the same.
13003.0,Patient,"Okay, I do have one question, because when I read the email I usually don't read it, I just put it gnosis sitting out here like what my next appointment is it says another survey joining just survey today with you or after you before."
510.0,Provider,yeah the surveys are actually on the bright heart health website so yeah did they tell you which ones that needed to be done.
13003.0,Patient,"And no I mean I know my other two weekly ones that I do every week I didn't use this before group and then one every 90 days. That I don't know which one needs to be done, so I know it was a different one than the other two are you take, and then that."
510.0,Provider,"yeah what's interesting is the last Depression and anxiety, those are the ones I look at you did this last week, so I don't know if it's I don't know which one it is unfortunately so."
13003.0,Patient,that's it for you.
510.0,Provider,"yeah you actually from the bi weekly ones you're up to date so have you done your weekly ones, your. No, not yet I haven't okay so then go ahead if your group is Tuesday go ahead and do those today My guess is I the two that I always look at you're good to go and, if you want go ahead and do a patient satisfaction survey. I don't think you're at the 90 day mark, but maybe that would cover you but. As far as i'm concerned you're pretty good, but if you always if you. If you really are concerned, please contact the virtual clinic they can tell you exactly which ones over do, but I think you're probably okay my opinion.
