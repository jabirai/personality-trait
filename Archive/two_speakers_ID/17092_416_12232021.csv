17092.0,Patient,Good morning.
416.0,Provider,morning Francesca our you.
17092.0,Patient,Get her you hold on my cat is like obsessed with the top okay.
416.0,Provider,"You know it's funny cats must have thanks laptop because I cannot tell you how many patients, I have where I see cabinets full time job."
17092.0,Patient,"yeah it's like especially her like when I was working from home in the pandemic she's obsessed. she loves the laptop, but I think she's going to go with her tower and. yeah she's a tower so we're good."
416.0,Provider,"it's so funny yeah it's a cat thing I don't know what it is. So it's been a while well, so we haven't seen each other, since December 1. How have things been going for you."
17092.0,Patient,"kind of a man i'm work has been okay like work is not really the concern right now but home life has been. Like. I don't get along with my own goal traditionally and I made a decision in December to move in to his house because. I just have really bad credit card debt and i'm getting to the point where my finances are not under control, so I wanted to move home replenish my savings and kind of. Be around and then he was like well it's also good, because you have a history of not taking your medication only. Be around to mention to the medication and then you you're really gotten heavy so i'll make sure you go to the gym, and all this other stuff so it turned into like this huge thing. So we made that decision, why I made that decision and early like mid December, and he and I got in a fight and like. Literally I made that decision and then like a week later, we got in a fight and then now i'm still moving back in with him, but the fights never resolved, and he refuses to talk about it so. it's just kind of like there so we're like in the background, softly not getting along and i'm slowly dismantling my independent life so it's like not ideal."
416.0,Provider,"So you haven't actually moved in with them, yet this is. This is still happening."
17092.0,Patient,"yeah i'm like i'm still kinda like you can't see it here but i'm so kind of like. Getting i'm getting my house together today like cleaning and then i'm going to go to home depot and start packing so I have like my book is is already out dismantle the my link I started throwing away like my. I have like a cabinet full of like useless paper like it's junk cabinet, so I started going through that. it's just the worst timing, because my sister's here to for Christmas and she's staying at his house and she's already had tension with him, because your boyfriend was supposed to come here for Christmas. But he ended up, not because he's got a lung disorder and on the Crown is on the rise and he's kind of a hypochondriac and they know a couple people that got it already so they're like he's like i'm not gonna stay in San Francisco and. So, like it's just chaos so that's been kind of what i'm working with, and on top of that, I like after I bought my boxes and got everything. My finances have been shitty. Like i'm literally like going to be in the negatives, by the end of this week because of stuff going on with like bills so it's going to be like insane. I didn't buy gas so that was the problem I have to go buy gas today and it's just a lot it's just everything at once it's mostly stuff that I did to myself, but then it's other stuff that like if we don't talk about this it's going to be a nightmare. Like I did the math like if I move in. I could leave in four months because that's my credit card debt paid off. And then I wouldn't replenish my savings like I had wanted to, but at least in four months I could just move out. But I don't know."
416.0,Provider,When your credit card debt was because you were having some pretty out of control spending right. And was that was a lot of like compulsive spending.
17092.0,Patient,"yeah and it's a lot of bullshit and I can't even point and say like Oh, this is a really expensive thing that I got I think the only really expensive thing I got was furniture for my apartment and then a replenishing loui Vuitton bag that got stolen, but I never turned in. Insurance thing like I had to send them the receipt to get reimbursed for partial of it, but I never did it so. it's just a lot but it's more than that it's like clothes and then going out a bunch of people and drinking and doing stuff and like just being expensive and like paying to like go to. Like yeah just to like go to things and yeah so it's like. i'm really mad at myself but it sucks because my uncle so mad at me thinking that i'm not mad at myself."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. Great so. Is your uncle's house your only option, this might like that is just kind of it."
17092.0,Patient,it's truly the only option.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's talk about survival strategies, while you're there then."
17092.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,Okay you've lived with him before right.
17092.0,Patient,yeah and it's been a shit show.
416.0,Provider,And how did you make it through.
17092.0,Patient,"I just hated my road a lot, or I was out a lot."
416.0,Provider,All right. So it's a lot about that right. And when you say he won't talk about the fight that you had like what actually happens when you bring it up.
17092.0,Patient,"He just he just goes, what are you going to apologize for that was like I didn't do anything."
416.0,Provider,To tell me about the fame.
17092.0,Patient,"yeah, of course, so. it's not true, I didn't do anything so. This is going to take a lot of context which is like shitty so. So much context. So my uncle has been in the closet like 50 years like and my sister and I were noticing he's been disappearing a bunch, and this is before. He came out of the closet but we were to us at least, but we were like wondering because we'd be fall off the map for like two or three days and then he popped up again. And we're both not living at home, so we thought it was weird so my sister was like I wonder what's going on and blah blah blah, so my sister snooped. Around on his phone, which I know she wasn't supposed to but she found him planning dates with this person we don't know. So turns out, he was like seeing this person and it got to the point where my sister said, you know you can tell me if you're gay whenever. No one cares because my sister and I are both bisexual we booked told him this and i've dated women and I brought them around and he has never had a problem, but I guess for him, he felt like he couldn't do anything but. So he. Finally, came out, but now he's dating this 34 year old guy who's never been to college. boasts about the places he takes him on his instagram post pictures of his car. Has pictures of our House. Like of his house post pictures of like jewelry that frank where's that he lets him try on like he literally is like a gold digger he's like clocking everything they do goes on instagram."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
17092.0,Patient,"We don't know fight because he was like I want you to meet this person and keep in mind he's only been dating him like a month and, apparently, they already said I love you and all the shit. And nikki's been taking her boyfriend for like two months, and I said I love you they've kind of gotten more serious and he treated it like it was the end of the world, and she got. This he was like shaming Irving, like he must want something he must be like a bad person like it's too quick blah blah blah. To her meanwhile he's being a total hypocrite so I told him i'm like I don't really want to meet him yet, because I think you guys are new it's a new relationship you guys. he's really younger than you and you've told me that he's not going to last because he's super younger than you so I don't want to meet somebody. If they're not going to last I said, if you have somebody that you think is going to be a long term partner, I want to meet them, but not somebody that you think is not going to last like. he's like he's for right now, not forever and i'm like well, then why do I have to meet this person you're lying to me. But that's the only option. Nikki met him, and so on, fight was basically me being like. I don't want to him. Please don't make me meet him unless you guys are serious and then push push push you have to be them, you have to meet him. And I said, and then I got really mad, and I was like why aren't you supposed to be in the closet isn't this something that you don't do, and then we just got a full fledged name calling back and forth for like 10 minutes, and then I just hung up on it."
416.0,Provider,"So, you said that there are parts of that conversation that you wish. You could change on your end."
17092.0,Patient,"I mean I. Know it's tough to do that because i've done that. I don't appreciate him. about this. You know, like if the person serious say you know he's a lot younger than me but he's serious you know I think I think I see a lot longer with it. it's the light. To me, that makes me upset. Because I always thought that he was a liar The other thing, and this is just more proof."
416.0,Provider,So it sounds like it's a lot less about this conversation and more about like this conversation brought up a lot of underlying stuff for you.
17092.0,Patient,"yeah and here's the thing. he's always had an unhealthy, you could have like. relationship with Nikki and I he always makes us like his therapist and he always makes us like. Like, for instance, if he's having a fight with somebody to call."
416.0,Provider,"US and treat us like a therapist like I feel this way, and you know they said this and what should I do, or what should I do that and even when Nikki and I were young and it didn't make any sense to do."
17092.0,Patient,"This like he was doing this, when I was. He wasn't like. When he was in. His 40s and I was in my 20s he was doing. So it's like it doesn't make sense. And I feel like. he's and it looks like he's outsource some of that because we haven't been around to this new person and then, at the same time, he told my sister well I don't need you guys to go out and try restaurants anymore, I can go out with you know. him I just need you guys, you know you guys can have all the intellectual conversations and give me advice and stuff because he's not that smart. And I was like first of all, this is a person you're in a relationship with you're going to talk about them like that, like what the Fuck I found this out after. So my problem with him if he always. Always kind of creates an unhealthy dynamic and then gets mad when you try to like with vicki and I are therapy i'm going to fix it. So that's it my concern and i'm kind of annoying because. Now he's got this thing it will you're homophobic i'm not homophobic i'm just gonna tell you I don't like you. Like it's just My problem with you, like you, it's not about you being gay it's about being an asshole."
416.0,Provider,"So there's a lot of history to unpack here right a lot of feelings and it sounds. Like you guys are to the point where you're not really able to have a conversation without bringing in all the emotion, all the feelings around him into it."
17092.0,Patient,"Right yeah yeah and the thing is Oh, and the worst thing is my mom and him my mom was bad with money my mom had a bad. relationship with him, where they were once really close and then they stopping being friends or whatever, so now he has displaced things that he used to be mad at my mom for with me. So yeah."
416.0,Provider,So lots and lots and lots of history there.
17092.0,Patient,Oh yeah. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"thing about these relationships when they get like this. If both people stay in the same dynamic if neither person changes, then nothing ever will change. right because it's like it's like you guys established patterns that maybe you didn't even establish that maybe your mom establish them with him, but you guys have continued them. Right these like really unhealthy kind of interactive patterns and it doesn't feel good to either view right this sort of like when you walk away. It feels kind of awful to both of you. So unless somebody makes like a really big change in their dynamic it's not going to change. Right does that make sense yeah. And it sounds like you keep really hoping that he will be the one to do that. And that that feels fair to you because he's hurt you a lot. But unfortunately we can't control what he does. can only control what you do. Right. So the question becomes again. Is there a part of that conversation will leaving out the history. Just pretend, you have that conversation with somebody somebody different somebody you respect and care for. Are there parts of that conversation that you would like you know you would have wanted to do differently. Because that's one part we can control right."
17092.0,Patient,yeah there are.
416.0,Provider,So tell me about that what part would you do differently.
17092.0,Patient,"We think I wouldn't have attacked him. Where I knew it would hurt him the most about being in the closet. I think I would have just. think it would have just said, my piece, and just been like this is a boundary i'd appreciate it if you respected it, and if you can't respect it then don't. don't do it, even though I knew he would have to be cross it anyway, but I still could have handled it better. And I told him my reasoning better and clearer, without it being like a personal attack."
416.0,Provider,"So I think. I think that in I think that it would be healthiest in this situation for you to control what you can, which is own up to your piece. Of that conversation. We can't control, whether or not he's going to own up to his we don't know what his response to this will be. And you don't even have to do it in person, you can do it in writing if you want, if that feels better or safer to you. But. owning up to it and just saying not rehashing the conversation, but just saying. i've been thinking about it, and I would like to own up to, I would like to apologize for attacking you in that way. I felt. However, you felt right like unheard like i'm. Like. I felt frustrated, you know that I wasn't hearing you respect this boundary upset. And I responded in a way i'm not proud of. i'm truly hold on one second sorry. i've got a visitor hold on one SEC take her. sorry about that Francesca. This is the perils of having your children home from school. Work from home. So who knows right what's going to happen. And how he will respond, I think, given, like all of that you can even say in the letter or in the whatever you can even say uncle we have a lot of history. And you can even say, like in therapy, we have been talking about how that history and all of the built up feelings get brought into every conversation. So my reactions are heightened because of that. and But I apologize or and I apologize. I apologize for my part of that. Right and you're only apologizing for the stuff that you really want to apologize for right not apologizing for holding a boundary that was important for you. it's just for reacting in a way that you didn't feel proud of right, you would like to do that differently next time that's it. In my experience. doing that. By doing that you've sort of. First of all, I think you've changed the dynamic. right because that's not part of what how you guys have spoken for a long time so who knows how he'll react that. He may apologize to he may. Double down we don't know right but that's on him and. But. you're going to walk away from the situation in a different way than you have in the past. Right you're gonna walk away feeling like. I took the high road i'm prouder then right, I am proud of the way I responded to this. Does that sound. How does that all land with you."
17092.0,Patient,"it's a different way of apologizing. I mean i've always apologized usually because. he's decided to like behave in some way, where I have to or he's been in an appropriate at work, like a mean toward me at work and it's obvious that we're fighting and if I don't apologize it's going to be unprofessional but he doesn't see that. So. Like. I know I have to do it, but. never done it like this."
416.0,Provider,What is it usually look back when you apologize.
17092.0,Patient,I just say like i'm sorry I said I was wrong I shouldn't have said that. And then it's all hunky dory until the next fight yeah. it's just.
416.0,Provider,So um so nothing ever really gets resolved.
17092.0,Patient,"No, I just get angrier and he just gets more oblivious. It just. blows up again."
416.0,Provider,yeah that's a lot of stress.
17092.0,Patient,"yeah it is. it's like. I had my first trial, this week, like ever, and it was less stressful than putting up on him like it literally got done and I was like oh that's nothing, why was I so worried. And then Now this is like so stressful. And I feel like and then it just you go home and you kind of walk on eggshells, because he is very specific about how he does everything, and if you don't do it the way that he wants you to do it, you get berated. So. Literally this year or six months or whatever it turns out to be it's going to be like a prison sentence. Not looking forward to it and it sucks because i'm mad at myself, because I got myself into this. Like I."
416.0,Provider,"can see if there's an opportunity to do things differently. Maybe there is right, who knows I."
17092.0,Patient,"mean my sister. my sister seems to be doing better with him like she's still upset but it's better you seem to get along. And she still says, all the stuff I do but somehow she doesn't get trouble so."
416.0,Provider,"You too there's a there's a in dialectical behavioral therapy, they have some strategies to speak up for yourself, and these are things I used in real life, so I can vouch for them. And I find that really helpful. Are you open to because this might be a good skill to arm you with moving into your uncle's. Right. Okay um I didn't send you today send you the dpt workbook."
17092.0,Patient,Though you did.
416.0,Provider,"i'm going to hold on, let me do that right now okay. hold on I won't be able to see you for a SEC. There you Francesca. Next login every time. me. For some reason I can't find it. it's on its way through your email."
17092.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,So as soon as you've grabbed get it go ahead and open it up. together. Okay.
17092.0,Patient,got it.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so go ahead and open it up. and i'm going to do the same, on my end. There we go alright so it's on page. let's go ahead and start with page 44. We can, maybe go through a little bit of this together. If you're up for it."
17092.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,So this is the I have we talked about dialectical behavioral therapy I can't remember if we went through that.
17092.0,Patient,"Yes, we did."
416.0,Provider,"Okay yeah yeah I think DVD is going to be a really good fit for you and. Just kind of from what I know about you, but it fits so nicely into what you're talking about right like there's a lot of stuff around interpersonal relationships, particularly with your own call. That is, I know, really, really tricky for you lots of families stuff and it dates back a long time. And and. being effective in those situations because they're so emotionally laden that. it's so tricky right. And so, interpersonal these are interpersonal effective skill effectiveness skills are really helpful when you have that kind of stuff right. So being able to speak up for what you want and need in ways get other people to take you seriously saying no effectively right, I think that it sounds like you do, that really well in your friendships. But in your in your family relationships that's a real struggle is that is that right. So um. So things that kind of get in the way is on page 45. If you read through this, what do you think which ones, would you check. factors in a way of interpersonal effectiveness."
17092.0,Patient,"Wait I think I burned, the road page hold on."
416.0,Provider,Man 45 now.
17092.0,Patient,Knowing practicing is a practicing loving kindness to increase the level of compassion. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I must have given you a different version of it, oh sorry it's paid okay sorry it's slide 45 page 52 my bad."
17092.0,Patient,"Okay, no worries. yeah there we go. i'm sorry, what was the question again."
416.0,Provider,"So, if you read through this, what are the things that like for you get it you didn't get in the way of being really effective with in these relationships with your family."
17092.0,Patient,yeah. Not knowing what I really want. about being able to citing. Emotions getting in the way. impulses getting in the way of long term goals. Sometimes other people getting in the way.
416.0,Provider,thoughts and beliefs.
17092.0,Patient,negative consequence worry. Not deserve a good.
416.0,Provider,You are other people. there's a lot of emotional stuff that's getting in the way.
17092.0,Patient,yeah there's a lot of check marks. That would be happening.
416.0,Provider,"So in dialectical behavioral therapy and this isn't a different part of book, but we don't need to go there, I can just kind of explain it to you and. marsha linehan the woman who writes about this talks about three different States of mind that we can be in right So if you picture two concentric circles. On one end on one side there's our emotional mind and when we're sort of in that emotional state of mind, we are very reactive are purely driven by emotion and our our logical brain or thinking brain is. Not that accessible it's not a balance right we're heavily. Like you talked about being impulsive right like. it's those emotional impulses that are sort of like. Right and. All of those that's where all of the history, you know starts to bubble up and influence what's coming out of our mouths and how we're interacting and stuff like that too right so that's the emotional side. we're not connected to thinking brain and then the other concentric or the other circle is. Our reasonable brain or a rational brain and that might sound much healthier, but in a lot of ways it's not because that's the part that's completely detached from our emotions right, so this is where. A lot of people go when they're really triggered they sort of like detach themselves completely from their emotions and they're just it's just the facts right it's just let me win, let me intellectually argue my way through this. Right, this is the brain that you're probably in when you're at work. not connected to your own emotions as much right. yeah so it's where these two cross it's that little section in the middle that's the healthiest and that's called our wise mind you'll hear me say those words a lot in therapy. And it's where we have access to both parts of ourselves right both states of mind, so we are we're in control, we have access to our higher level of thinking. And, but we're also aware of our emotions or thoughts beliefs emotions right the good those are part of the equation, but they're not in the driver's seat. Right it's a nice balance so being in our was mind is really important, when we are. When we are getting into it, with people right when we're having conversations, especially with people we know are full of triggers and landmines. We need to be in that wise mind to be able to manage it. And that it really decreases that sort of impulsivity. So i'm going to skip the next page for a second, and I wanted to get into. going straight into it on your book that would be page 57. it's the dear man yeah. Okay, so in dear man and it's just a simple acronym for, and you, you want to be in your wise mind as much as possible when you're doing this right, and so, if I know that I have a conversation coming up with somebody who is a big fat trigger for me or. or some or it's a conversation that i'm just nervous to have i'm not sure how it's going to come out of my mouth and I will actually do this in advance right i'll plan this out just at least my end of it because I don't want it go flying into my emotional mind and. So I would describe the situation so, for example, the example that you have right with not wanting to meet your uncle's boyfriend. So you would simply describe the situation stick to the facts. And it would be something very simple like and. I know that you really want me to meet him and i'm not ready to do that yeah. Right simple simple I told you that or I would I told you that i'm not quite ready to do that yet. And then, so that would be the D. And then the he is where you express your feelings and opinions right and you're in you want to use as many I statements right not you should you didn't blah blah blah it's. I care about you and I really want to meet people who are going to be in your life long term. But since you said he's not long term I prefer not to meet him yet. Simple simple right, and I think you said that, I think you did a really good job with that part right and then. We kind of just I just kind of just folded a in there too right, this is where you ask for what you want, or you say no really clearly, and so we kind of did a little bit of that with the previous statement, but I think you can even say something like I would really appreciate. US putting this convert or putting this discussion to bed. Right, this is in, or I would really appreciate, if you would respect that boundary that I have. Right and then the RS for reinforce. um. And for reinforced, I think, be given the dynamic between you and your uncle I would go a little farther than I would normally recommend something like. I really appreciate it on call. I appreciate who you are, I appreciate who you love. And I want to support you, I just want to hold this boundary. Right just just like reinforcing the statement and then the man part is when you get so that's the part you actually say the man part is the. Is your mind frame right, so if he goes off and doesn't respect what you just said. This is where you stay mindful you stay focused on your goals in the conversation right maintain your position don't be distracted don't get off topic. So this is where you kind of become like a broken record you just keep keep responding calmly responding, this is a boundary i'm going to keep. I love you and appreciate you, and if this is important to me. Right. And then, if he goes off on you always are you never or I don't think you really or you know kind of goes way off on starts talking about the past, whatever. This is where you ignore those attacks and you just simply say something like. I hear that there are other things that are behind this right like that this this boundary that I have is kind of upsetting you and. And that there's a lot more to all of this because we have a history, but for now i'm just going to stay on this small you know we can talk about that stuff later right now I just i'm going to stay right, where we are. Right. i'm going to hold this boundary. And the a's for appearing confident. Right we're not going to stammer whisk whisper we're not going to stay at the door you're just going to stay calm stay confident make eye contact. Right. And then the end is for negotiate, so the be willing to give to get. So, knowing in advance, like which parts that you might be open to changing. So, like if he says something like, but this is really important to me. You might say something like. Why tell me more about why this is important because it sounds like maybe this isn't a casual relationship. Right. Or what do you propose as a compromise here uncle. Right yeah. How does this sound to you."
17092.0,Patient,Actually.
416.0,Provider,So the. The next couple pages like go into dear man. A little or the next page goes into dear man with like more description. So you can you can read through that and. and So i'm going to have you read through this actually I can I give you some homework.
17092.0,Patient,"yeah, of course."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to have you read through interpersonal effectiveness and where we just started. i'm going to have you read up to page 55 so from. From 40 or sorry from 54 page 54 to. Page 6254 to 62. And I want you to look for opportunities to practice some of this stuff right. How does that land."
17092.0,Patient,With the holidays coming up i'm sure there will be no shortage of opportunity.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. we're going to talk a lot more about ways to stay in your wise mind. and And mindfulness in general, so in all of this stuff Francesca with moving in and all the stress that you're under financial and otherwise, how are you how do you take care of yourself like, how do you. Stay balanced in your mind and your heart and."
17092.0,Patient,"While you're really like pleading for some reason i've enjoyed about a date which is good, I tried to take like a minute or so a bit of a meditate. Somebody is what I can do like 10 minutes really various but it's not a lot of days so. So yeah."
416.0,Provider,"OK so you've got. awesome I think. The things that you already do that help you. Right, so that that means like kind of more of the the healthy stuff the meditating right, not the shopping, but the stuff that you don't feel guilty about for afterwards the stuff that you feel good about afterwards, increasing that as we go into the holidays, as you go into this move. Right. All of that is going to help you feel more balanced and then your wise mind. it's going to help you respond to your uncle a lot better. And again i'm like i'm saying this not because this is all on you like these interactions i'm not I don't don't mean to imply that at all because they're not, this is not he holds his role in this. Just going into it, though, recognizing that there's only one part of this conversation, you can control yeah right there's only one part of this interaction, you have any control over at all. So let's do that. let's change the dynamic by changing your piece of it."
17092.0,Patient,Get focused on him changing that's not gonna happen.
416.0,Provider,"No. No, but you can ask for what you need right and you. end up in ways that you walk away feeling really proud of. yeah. Big deep breaths."
17092.0,Patient,No. I wasn't getting about the crying.
416.0,Provider,"crying no i'm a therapist i'm like cry please now it's good to great release those emotions our I mean you've got like years of frustration and hurt built up in you. This is the healthy way to let it out, I fully support, having full crying fits writing it all down screaming into your pillow punching your couch whatever like out. you're right. So you know a lot of these skills are things that you didn't have opportunities to learn and and let's just recognize doesn't sound like he did either. Your mom and your sister didn't really have the opportunities to learn them either. Right, you had opportunities at school to practice social interactions with your peers and you are good at those you know you have friends you're close to people. But your home life was such that you didn't have any opportunities to practice or to even witness a lot of really healthy interactions. So this dynamic didn't start with you. Sam it started way before you were probably even born. But you were you were taught to be a part of it. You were drawn into it. And it's just causing you a lot of misery. And the only part that you have control over is yours to change it. To be easy. So Francesca and let's see do we have have you been having any suicidal thoughts or ideations. into we have. Future appointments scheduled."
17092.0,Patient,I think we have. A better one of the 30th.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, we do yeah the 30th perfect the 30th and the fifth so um yeah so we're scheduled."
17092.0,Patient,"Actually, you know what the 30th may not be the best day it's actually the data moving but i'll call them to reschedule or can I do it with you."
416.0,Provider,"You can do it well. Do you want to just keep the fifth, then you can actually."
17092.0,Patient,have it. yeah let's keep the faith and let's cancel the 30.
416.0,Provider,"Okay i'll let them know, let me just send them a message, really. So beef up the self care activities. you're going to need them. it's funny because these are like the first things that we tend to let go in times of high stress and that's the time when we need them the most right. So reemphasize those and then homework in the book. and see if you can practice, some of these skills right part of it is. I don't know if you've ever done this, but if you find yourself getting really emotional and a conversation if things are going South even just saying you know what i'm feeling really emotional right now I care about this conversation and I don't want it to go sideways. And i'm going to end the conversation right now and we can revisit it when i'm calm. Even just saying that he's really been is powerful and holding to that right we care about this conversation I don't want it to go sideways i'm not in a state of mind to have it. Right you're not blaming it on anybody else you're just saying i'm not there yet, and I really want to revisit this later I will we can do doesn't need to get resolved right the second. yeah even if that's all we do that's a big one. Have you ever tried."
17092.0,Patient,"i've tried saying something like. You know, like, I think we need a break and then leaving like taking myself out of the conversation, but never being clear as to why just exiting the conversation. yeah which has a completely different effect does."
416.0,Provider,"Right, then people feel like not heard they feel hung up on right. So firstly right and versus also saying, like you, owning it i'm not in a great headspace right now to have this conversation I care about the conversation you don't want it to go sideways i'll come back when i'm calm. it's like so it's very disarming to say that. Right, because then it's on you you're taking responsibility for your own headspace you're not blaming it on them and, frankly, it might be them. But they're triggering you so you're not making it any better right, but just owning it calmly and just saying later we'll come back to this later. you're part of a cycle that you didn't create and it sucks. All right, Francesca do you have anything else, for me, before I let you go today."
17092.0,Patient,"No, thank you."
416.0,Provider,"All right, so you up for doing this homework."
17092.0,Patient,yeah I even took notes.
416.0,Provider,Okay okay so i'm going to see you on the fifth you're moving on the 30th yep take care of yourself through this lots of self care okay. yeah and lots of letting out those emotions cry do what you gotta do. it's gonna it's going to bring all that up right.
17092.0,Patient,Thank you.
416.0,Provider,"All right, and if something comes up between now and then, and you need to you really want to see me sooner you start feeling really awful please reach out you've got my email, you know how to call braveheart. Right. yeah i'll make time. All right, take care."
