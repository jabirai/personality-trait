If you can't show up call to reschedule for that week, but if you're not showing that individuals they will discharge because. you're in compliance that use I saw I I shared my screen with you, so you can see, you have chart you have one survey so call virtual clinic. ask for your care navigator if they don't have it just talk to whoever's there have them send you that survey and and ask them about whatever I have no idea what the previous doctor sent to you because there's nothing like your chart that says that you have to talk to them. But if they're saying that you have to go to group every week, you should be showing up every week to the group."
3126.0,Patient,"So twice about this is what they told me and then, when they got as a lawyer who do. So he won't show."
