15932.0,Patient,December 1996 grand a month.
498.0,Provider,Thank you for joining me today how are you today.
15932.0,Patient,Good how are you.
498.0,Provider,"i'm okay i'm Okay, how is the 10 milligrams of arrow going."
15932.0,Patient,it's pretty much same.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, any any change at all fill in any bump feeling anything."
15932.0,Patient,"Now, well, I still think it helps with my mood regulation. I think, because well because one day to take it, and I was already at work so it's too late to take them, so I went the whole day without it. And that day compared to a day with that is like. yeah I feel like I don't know I don't get so caught up on things like I could like brush something off a little easier like or if I am getting caught on something I could look at it a little more objectively be like okay like. We deal with that later."
498.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15932.0,Patient,It doesn't ruin my whole day.
498.0,Provider,any difficulty with regard to side effects.
15932.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,no problems with sleeping no problems with eating. You know okay i'm. Okay. um. Are you comfortable with going up just a little bit more.
15932.0,Patient,"I am I was curious about like the instant release or the immediate release versus. an extended extended only because i've been finding i'm trying to fix it, but my schedules like not consistent like sometimes I go in at eight in the morning and then sometimes I go in at three in the afternoon and so. If maybe immediate release would make more sense for that i'm trying to have it to where it by the consistently morning or consistently afternoon, it just hasn't really gotten there yet."
498.0,Provider,"i'm being a medium immediate release is dosed twice a day. Okay, so um you know how we talked about like the extended release is like 10 to 12 hours well the immediate release of kind of like. Five to roughly about six or seven hours tops so that's why it's dose like twice a day so with an ever evolving schedule the immediate release may be more beneficial to you. Because it's you can dose it according to like when the day begins, you can do the same with the immediate release with the extended release but. If your data is short, for any reason, or if the length of the day fluctuates then you're still going to be, you know you can still going to be in play for that 10 to 12 hour bump. Somebody, what do you think what worked best for yourself."
15932.0,Patient,"I think. Because with if I did immediate release, even though it's dosed for twice a day I could technically just take one dose right like if I didn't want to take it in the morning and I just wanted to take it before work. yeah. I feel like that would work better fit my schedule."
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay um tell me about. tolerate tolerate in the side effects Okay, and if you're still I can't stress this enough you're still a fairly low dosage. You mentioned that you feel like it's helping you with attention and focus is that what you just said."
15932.0,Patient,not really. I haven't noticed any of that yet. Okay i'm just emotion regulation which I I don't even know if that's an effect and maybe i'm just like placebo myself.
498.0,Provider,"or it could be that you feel like an elevation and mood because, though, you may not have had the bump with regard to attention focus because of this stimulative effect you've helped felt a bump in metabolism, so the increased energy. Could could ultimately affect your overall mood."
15932.0,Patient,don't make sense yeah.
498.0,Provider,"yeah, which is why i'm not so much taken aback by you saying you feel a little bit better but you're still kind of dealing with attention and focus, how is how's work going. Along with the medication tell me if you feel any improvement into productivity, as an overall."
15932.0,Patient,"Okay, like. On the day I went to work and I didn't take it. yeah I feel more productive, maybe know if not more productive just less. No. I don't know because the day I didn't take it, I think I became very paranoid of mine like attention issues, and so I was like i'm not gonna do anything to mess up because. And then. i'm still burning things. Now I don't feel more productive and my house is messy and it's been a while, so I guess that would be indicative of my productivity."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, not necessarily productivity, maybe organization, but not necessarily productivity. Have you have you had a chance to engage with the therapy recently."
15932.0,Patient,"Now I have, and I, I went to my last therapy appointment and I guess I don't know something happened, but she wasn't there. So I just didn't schedule another one. Because I was having like scheduling issues."
498.0,Provider,"Tell me. Let me kind of explain the rationale behind asking this question so, of course, part of the program requirements is that you engage in therapy and group therapy so that's one thing, but. Normally I would have at least four days a week to accommodate like patient appointment. That availability is kind of decreasing down to two days a week, because i'm covering hours for another clinic two days a week, so i'm. Some of the patients that I really like to engage with frequently even on a weekly or bi weekly basis and asking about joining a group and one because it's required by the program but. For me personally, because I would like to be able to see you, more often than I know i'll have a chance to schedule a one to one appointment. Because i'm a part of the groups to and it gives me a chance to check in with everybody individually, I don't want to have to wait. Two weeks or in this case four weeks when I know i'm going to have another one to one appointment available for you to check in with regard to how to medication is going in case we need to make any revisions or change it. For sure and. So is that something that you would be receptive to."
15932.0,Patient,yeah totally.
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay. gives me a chance to check in like we can to continue moving forward so. With the simulated therapy, I think we talked about before simulate of therapy requires frequent check in and then urine drug screens, just as a part of the Protocol. Honestly, has nothing to do with you. So i'll get that scheduled for you, but i'll do we're going to switch over to the immediate release correct and do the 15 milligrams. Okay okay. Any. Any feelings of emotional instability any. episodes of low over the last two weeks. Since you've been on the 10."
15932.0,Patient,"I mean, I had a bad day on Sunday, but I don't think it was an episode I think if there was just things that were. reasonably annoying. yeah."
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay. So, thus far. you've had you've you've been with the. The circling adderall combo for about a month now. And though you haven't had any. Huge Aha moments of like this is it. It doesn't sound like you've had any. regression either."
15932.0,Patient,No okay.
498.0,Provider,Okay.
15932.0,Patient,"Anything I feel. Like yeah I said, good better than I did before."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so we may be moving in the right direction and, like I said we're still on once I mean we're still on a very, very low dose even even with going up to if you're still not on average dosage. So. This is just me kind of taking it slow and making sure that nothing, nothing set you back so um any problems with sleeping any problems with eating. Okay, any any thoughts about harming yourself. No okay. um. any problems with memory. Okay okay. yeah. me seeing or hearing anything that isn't there. yeah nightmares."
15932.0,Patient,No that'd be like yeah like just dreams they're not like terrified there's like stress strings.
498.0,Provider,Okay okay. um any acute changes that you have noticed in the past two to four weeks since the induction of the adderall. Anything that concerns you.
15932.0,Patient,"No really somebody mentioned, and I didn't look into it, because I know that just looking into it was just kind of like you know. That they were like our own gives you heart problems and I was just like Oh well, i've got other problems too so might as well you know, like so maybe that is worrisome but I haven't felt anything in relation to that, but."
498.0,Provider,"Oh adderall is not a great option for you, if you have underlying cardiac issues you have not presented with with it, yet, and what they mean by that is that it can it's a stimulant. So it can raise your heart rate some but by about five to eight beats a minute it's not going to give you. heart failure and we don't even suspect that you'll you'll need to consume it forever."
15932.0,Patient,This is.
498.0,Provider,"This is bridge therapy to get you to a space that's comfortable for you and then for psychotherapy to solidify that space. And then you know, at some point you'll taper off, and you know engage your skills, what I advise you to take out a wall for the next 30 years know. there's a lot of things I wouldn't advise that you do for the next 30 years I want you to you know pursue your dreams and and live your life. But i'm short term, you know therapy for a little while i'm dictated by your needs and your presentation um it does not cause heart problem."
15932.0,Patient,So.
498.0,Provider,"It can increase your blood pressure, because your blood pressure is increased, when you when your heartbeats a little bit faster. But minimally it's not going to double it it's not even going to increase it by 25%. or even a full 10%."
15932.0,Patient,"yeah that was like the only concern for me, other than that."
498.0,Provider,"um well anytime you have a question or concern you can feel free to make an inquiry and then i'll provide you with all the information that's available to me. So yeah i'm out, I will take care of. Your refill, of course, the stimulus therapy we're kind of going through a phase of. Regulation to make sure that all of our t's are crossed and i's are dotted and so it'll be a short term prescription but. i'll get you oh my gosh your schedule okay wait. Are you available on Mondays in or Wednesdays for group."
15932.0,Patient,Monday OK. group weekly i'm okay with weekly.
498.0,Provider,"If you do, I was going to say, if you do group twice a month, then that way, I could check in with you every two weeks, which will cycle around and. Actually, if you do it with me weekly, though. That way, I can check in with you weekly and I won't have to rely on. engagement with your therapist are you okay with doing weekly on Mondays."
15932.0,Patient,yeah that's okay.
498.0,Provider,"That will work for me that way, I could check in with you at the beginning of the week, take care of your refills and then you're good for the week that that's an excellent idea brandon, thank you for that."
15932.0,Patient,No problem anything.
498.0,Provider,Any other ideas you have for today.
15932.0,Patient,"No, I have something I wanted to share, though, what."
498.0,Provider,Is it.
15932.0,Patient,"So you know the birds and one of them has been building a nest. Today, on top of my computer."
498.0,Provider,No that's not an egg laid in that nest.
15932.0,Patient,"i've been so stressed out i'm like babies having babies it's too much, but i'm also very excited and it's so cute."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so I know this is a little bit far fetched but I really need you to like get a camera."
15932.0,Patient,I have one on a different camera because I have a live feed when i'm at work so.
498.0,Provider,yeah so when the when the egg catches i'm going to need you to play it back for me.

Okay, and other than that we can just wrote, we can just check in every Monday with regard to how you doing reserve a few minutes after every group if anybody wants to check in with me one to one you can feel free to do that and then. If you know anything happens anything occurs send me a message, otherwise from now on we meet every Monday okay. sounds good Okay, thank you for to see you know what it's so strange I don't it's not the first of the morning so that's why I keep like thinking in the back of my mind i'm thinking like what time is it because I feel like it should be 530."
