706.0,Provider,"Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I called you by your preferred name. So we're going to do your bps bio psychosocial assessment."

706.0,Provider,Can you hear me now.
15487.0,Patient,"Yes, perfect I lost you."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so I was just saying that they're bps is just a bunch of questions that we asked so that we've got a background on you, so we know what to focus on in therapy."
15487.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"All right. So go ahead and get started, why first why don't you tell us what brings you to brain hurt."
15487.0,Patient,"Well, as i'm. Like I said I I wasn't like a really bad drug addiction, but. I had back surgery in 2005 and i'm. Just I you know i've been on pain medication off pain medication, on pain medication on and off on and off, you know, and there was a friend of mine that was on these suboxone. And they swore by them, and so I just tried a couple of them and they seem to you know they seem to work for me, without you know wanting the pain medication and they help my nerves and I don't they just helped me sleep and that you know just. it's more rounded or more grounded, I should say you know, like. I guess that's how I want to explain it."
706.0,Provider,Okay um when you were younger like a teenager up to adulthood currently did you use any other substances alcohol or any other drugs.
15487.0,Patient,"Well, back in the day when we were teenagers yeah we drink some and we smoke a little bit of thought here and there, but. I had done that, for years I was in the bar business my husband and I was in the bar business for a while I was married to him for 20 years and got divorced because. He turned into an alcoholic but I never let alcohol control my life, you know, like he did and i've never really had problems with the alcohol and the marijuana you know and stuff like that, but. it's just you know when, after you are, if you need a surgery, and you have it done it might correct one thing, but it causes other things. and pain, you can deal with different so long and it starts working with your mind affecting your mind, and you know your daily life and everything, and so you just you seek relief, you know."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So i'm The one thing that you know opioids do and we'll get into it more in therapy, but the one thing opioids do is they. change them the passages of the brain so basically what that states is that once your body becomes dependent on opioids. It will do anything it can to be able to get them, so you will feel typically more pain taking opioids then not taking opioids so like percocet things like that. you'll feel more pain, because your body will produce what they call secondary pain to make sure it continues to get that opioid. Once you've come off of that opioid and you like start something like suboxone which is kind of an artificial it's artificial opioids what plugs those opiate receptors you'll find that your pain gets less because those receptors are being plugged without that drug does that make sense."
15487.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah yeah I worked in healthcare for 20 years I wasn't a nurse, I was a nurse's aide but yeah I do understand that's that stuff."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so so that's probably why the suboxone works so well, is because it plugs those receptors so you're not getting that secondary pain anymore that you were getting when you were taking your other pain medication. Because your body was dependent upon it, and so it was creating secondary pain to make sure you took it. yeah so um so have you done any other treatment or anything for this have you sought out any other nope this first time."
15487.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, this is the first time."

But I have one brother i'm really, really close to. But yeah my daughter, and my grandkids i've i've always been a big part of my grandkids his life because my daughter had them when she was young, so I kind of feel like I got to grow up with them. So, and I don't know I think about it and I wouldn't want it, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way honestly."
706.0,Provider,"No, but I mean that sounds like sounds like you've got a good support system, and you know good natural supports. People around you um What would you say your stress level is from day to day."
15487.0,Patient,"here's the thing I met this guy a couple of years ago and things went great for two or three while he moved in with me. And then things went great for two or three months. And then and I and i'm still trying to be with him. But he is very verbally abusive and he's very he doesn't he has no trust he has no respect for women. And my biggest stress issue is him. I told him I said. there's nobody. In my life has ever talked to me or treated me the way that you do, and you you're always saying how much you love me and use, you can say that a million times a day, but your actions say otherwise. So, and he lived with me for a while well. About two years and then recently i'm going to say three months ago, I had to have him move out because he had me to the point to where I just felt like I was gonna lose my mind. I couldn't see. You know he's jealous of me Hall, and the Amish he thinks i've slept with them all, and you know he's even accused me of going as far as sleeping with my grandkids my grandsons and. yeah i'm like dude you have a problem you know you have issues and you need to go get them taken care of."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15487.0,Patient,"Honestly, he wasn't like that in the beginning, you know. And I knew i've known him for probably 15 years but I guess not well enough but yeah he just he's just so insecure and. He just blames me for everything and just it's just horrible the and i'm still trying to to work, the relationship out with him, but he causes me more drama and stress and anger than. Then, as needed."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no it sounds like it, you know it's a funny thing when you think you know somebody you don't really know them, especially once you get to know them more intimately or especially have them live with you, you see things that you've never seen before."
15487.0,Patient,So that's right.
706.0,Provider,"that's pretty common to have that kind of Aha moment um, how do you feel like your self esteem as."
15487.0,Patient,"Well, oh, are you said pretty good self, esteem and I have led him i've led him drag me down there till. it's it was like for about a year ago, it seems like he tried everything that he possibly could he even made me lose my job at one time for three months and I had no income coming in and. He would offer to step up and paying bills, none of the bills, the course say when news they was mine, you know, but even though he lived here. He wouldn't step up and help pay the bills, so I just told him I said look i'm going to go talk to this guy to see if I can get my job back, because if I don't i'm going to lose everything i've worked for for the last five years. i'm gonna lose it all. And I think that's what he wanted, because he wanted me to be totally dependent on him."
706.0,Provider,it's a control thing um.
15487.0,Patient,Do you feel very much so.
706.0,Provider,"yeah definitely a control thing, do you feel as though you have any kind of like codependence on men or relationships."
15487.0,Patient,"No, no i'm very independent. Very I mean I he's the first guy i've lived with, and since I was married and i've been divorced for 21 years. Okay, so he's he's the first guy i've ever lived with since my divorce and 21 years okay."
706.0,Provider,"All right, so that is the end of the bps um So do you have any questions and i'll for me."
15487.0,Patient,I mean I don't know what what all you need to do here I mean I just told you how it was so I guess no I don't.
706.0,Provider,"ya know and that's all we want, so I asked the questions you answer them as best as you can and then what will happen now is twice a month we'll meet for therapy. And we'll just work through some of that stuff it sounds like this relationship is causing you a lot of stress and so I think that kind of looking at it and processing through. You know what your needs are that aren't being met, maybe work on some ways to communicate that I don't know it might not be a healthy relationship for you, you might want to just be. You might just have to say I really care about you, but you're not. Good for me, you know."
15487.0,Patient,"i've tried to tell him that. You know I are trying to tell them look I can't continue to live this way. I want you to go get some help so that we. You know if you love me as much as you say you do so, we can work these things, but he, like he'll come to my house or I haven't let him come here very much since. We you know he moved out. I think he's been here three or four times, maybe. But when he walks in. he's he looks for things like. things on the bed sheets and why the couch blanket has moved and um you know if I used to do shout out of the closet or I mean it's just yeah it's very psycho. Very to me."
706.0,Provider,sounds like there's some mental health things that probably haven't been diagnosed and and looked at and also sounds like there might be some paranoia and some insecurity so i'm like I said Those are all. Those are all things that can be talked about therapy and I think will help you. To to get through them and be able to hopefully either. make some changes to make you happier or hopefully encouraged change to make you happier. I don't think anybody should have to live in a controlling relationship where they're unhappy I don't think that's healthy.
15487.0,Patient,"I can't get through to him I just can't and. I can't continue to keep fighting with them every day, either."
706.0,Provider,got nope I completely understand um so we'll meet for therapy twice a month and you'll stop through the virtual clinic and um and then you have whatever group you're assigned you'll attend once a week and yeah and then we'll just kind of see how things go.
15487.0,Patient,"yeah I have group every Tuesday at seven. And i'm. Actually i've been oh i've probably been in this a little over two months now, I think I was supposed to have a couple meetings prior with you, but like the first the first couple I completely forgot about because I don't have a set schedule. And so I never know when i'm going to be on the road or I can make an appointment, I never know if i'm going to get called the work, and you know it's it's sometimes it's crazy but i'm glad I finally got to hook up with you."
706.0,Provider,yeah no absolutely so um yeah so next steps are just making those appointments at the virtual clinic and then I will see you in a couple weeks.
15487.0,Patient,"Okay, was nice to meet you."
706.0,Provider,"Nice to meet you, you have a great day."
15487.0,Patient,thanks you too.
706.0,Provider,bye bye.
