706.0,Provider,yeah yeah so what's what happened with the whole.
16869.0,Patient,"Court on the 26th of January and or 24th of January I don't know it's a domestic violence church he's saying that I punched him which I don't see how they even. put me in jail for he say she said thing like there's you know what I mean. Now well yeah he yeah he I have a video of him punching himself like with both hands, you know just box and paste. I also have videos of him all kinds of stuff but that's what he did he had to invite it and touch it, you know what I mean. But I didn't even know who's calling the police, he said that all in a text message, but he was blowing my phone up that day I wasn't reading anything. And I was actually in galleon just loaded up my truck my SUV and I was heading getting ready to head to Shelby and three COPs show up to come and arrest me because he will yeah yeah so I had to leave the truck I sat in jail until I went to court. It was rough."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh so is that that the guy that you, the last time I talked to you that you were you were with."
16869.0,Patient,"I was with him yeah I was living with my son's dad though over at the trailer. And then I heard was also living with us so it's all three of us, at one point that was horrible as an application. yeah it was rough my husband still wants to be with me, but I definitely don't want to be with him anymore and i'm definitely not going to be with her dad ever again I learned my lesson, this time I mean my family is worried that he's going to hurt or kill me or my kids. Really crazy. yeah go up in light of the police, like."
706.0,Provider,"sounds like there's some mental health issues there that aren't aren't. Oh, my gosh i'm so sorry, you had to go through that especially with your daughter being so young, I mean. it's it's good that she's not going to remember any of this because she's so young, but to be torn away from your baby is just."
16869.0,Patient,"Sure, is Oh, he had me hospitalized back in August, the same guy had me in the hospital for 17 days and I asked about my daughter, every day, and he didn't come visit me. He put me in there and saying that I wasn't in my right mind I don't remember, I think I did have like a stroke, or something i'm not sure what it was dehydration but. I don't really remember bits of time it was weird so I was in there for a while. I got out and I got on my radar which is helping."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah that'll definitely help I mean being on the right kind of medication, but it sounds like he needs a medication."
16869.0,Patient,"definitely needs medication, I think he has some schizophrenia like cuz he when we were together he'd seen any places that I wasn't just text my phone randomly i'd be at home you'd be like, why are you at goodwill. Like Oh, my goodness, you know he just he'd see me places he say he says weird stuff things that aren't real I don't know."
706.0,Provider,yeah I mean it could be that it could be bipolar can cause you to be delusional there's a lot of different a lot of different things um any substance use does he use substances.
16869.0,Patient,"I think, so I think that's how it all oh that's my alarm something else um. I think that he went and did something I don't know what, but it was the night before, for he went over to a friend's house out of town. And he came back and he was just weird and then the next morning that's when all that happened like. I asked him for my key back, I was allowing him to stay here, he was living in his car is still, but I was letting them stay in my house and I gave him a key and he was watching her daughter, while I while I work and he walked out on his job and everything but."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
16869.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So I mean that's I mean I guess it, that would be the one thing is like substance use because certain substances can cause. psychosis substance. And so that would be my first thing that I would think about it would be you know is that what's going on with him did he use something and now he's just kind of off his Rocker her little bit. As you know, drugs can do weird things so. it's very much you know, one of those things that if he used it and had like a bad batch of something it could cause that or if he was if his body was starting withdraw from whatever he tuck It can also cause that."
16869.0,Patient,"he's done this, a lot in our relationship we've been together, almost two years. And he's done this lot like not not this far, but I mean we fought a lot."
706.0,Provider,"So do you think that, I mean because you I mean obviously the mental health stuff but I mean, do you think he has he's shown any signs of using anything over."
16869.0,Patient,"yeah he didn't go to sleep at night that he came back from his friends house and then the next morning we got he. left as soon as I got up he wasn't a bed he's like I said it's going to bed he laid there with me and I fell asleep, I thought he was there and I woke up and he was gone. But I got up and he went to get cigarettes and he was gone forever like and it's just not even a mile down the road here in time to get cigarettes, so I thought that was kind of weird he comes back and he's just irate like totally different uh huh."
706.0,Provider,yeah I mean it kind of sounds like methamphetamines mean to be quiet.
16869.0,Patient,That sort of.
706.0,Provider,"Not can change your whole personality your whole disposition mental health, it will definitely cause psychosis. Point where you'll believe you're talking to people that aren't even there. So absolutely that that's a concern to I mean, which obviously if you're if you're done with him that's great, but you still have otter so you need to protect her if he is using substances."
16869.0,Patient,"So I know he doesn't see her he i'm married so it's a big ordeal like he got the paternity tests and he is the father. But there's no court. Nothing I have full custody, he has no rights, unfortunately for him yeah he has no rights and I think that's part of why he showed up yesterday. outside my house, I had to come in my house for me and Christmas lights because he's driving down my road he's he doesn't even. Like I said he lives in his car he's supposed to stay, not in this town, you know, and I think he was saying something about him wanting to see his daughter he's been calling me texting me on the seer and. Courts advise me not to make any contact back to him to you know to report it right away, and I have so."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so in your husband you're not going to be with either so. you're going to be by yourself, is that. Okay, you know, sometimes that's better you know. Better happy alone than miserable with other people. So um how are you doing i'm your mind's working okay everything. For you."
16869.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't gotten a drug screen in the mail yet i've done the original one but and then like I said I missed Group and I have an appointment with the doctor next week next Saturday, but i'll be out of it by then, but I should be okay till the next group but i'm supposed to go back into the room and see if I can't catch a different group for the end of the week."

706.0,Provider,"yeah if you updated your address, let me double check here. Is your address seven Jennings court. yeah okay. So it is, it is updated. So that's good um."
16869.0,Patient,"Are you going, are you trying. Call and getting sleepy already."
706.0,Provider,"yeah I don't see any notes in here, but if you didn't get one for December I would assume that it would probably be honest."
16869.0,Patient,"I just hope they didn't send it to I mean if they did it's no big deal my husband loves there, so I go, I still got stuff over there if they sent it to my old address, I still have the key so I could get I can get the mail stop."

When you go to your group, I would definitely. haven't gotten one because typically there's care navigators in there and then they can get one sent out to you. Okay um how have you been feeling mood wise."
16869.0,Patient,"I mean i've been going through a lot, so I wouldn't really I don't know you know, based on the circumstances like I don't take that really into consideration."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, what about any thoughts of like hopelessness not wanting to wake up any thoughts of wanting to kill."

706.0,Provider,And who has been when you're working.
16869.0,Patient,"husband not her dad. My oldest dad and my oldest teeth eight he's saying with his grandma to. not finish out school, but just to not move before Christmas break. Okay, and then, but I miss them like crazy and he misses me he wants to come home. hard to have him here through the week to drive them 20 minutes school is two months with her, she didn't even up that early so. I didn't call it for yesterday. They didn't call me back so I don't the school and Shelby. And then I still have to call. have to contact job and family is contact Community action and hopes to help me with my utilities, they charge a deposit of $310 here in this town. Just to get the. character, but I know. It was only one gallon so I have that one coming back. After 30 days of it being off. And I left one for my husband, because he doesn't have money to get it on you don't even have 150 to turn it on so. i'm hoping that they help with some of that or something. Last deal because there's a lot."
706.0,Provider,"yeah sounds like there's a lot going on i'm important that you take some time for you and just. be able to even if it's, for you know 10 minutes after she goes to bed to like take a bath or a shower and just decompress because you can't hold all of that tension all the time and just go go go because eventually like anything else you'll just crash. and obviously you can't crash, because you have an infant and infants don't let you crash. I have. I have an almost three year old and ever since he was born there has been no resting there's just go so. it's. You know and as you. You know you have your eight year old so you know he's he doesn't need you as much right now but 10 years he'll be a major and they're just oh so much oh so much fine, I have a 13 year old to so. You know it. you're going to have the best of both worlds like I did you have a toddler and a teenager."
16869.0,Patient,"hell, yes."
706.0,Provider,"that's good that's good hopefully he he keeps that way. What happens when their brain becomes a teenager and. They just turn into this weird person you don't even know. kind of crazy. But i'm the person that was stalking you so be your daughter's father. He leaving you alone now like, do you feel."
16869.0,Patient,This is all no I don't feel safe and the COPs will do thing they tell me to go hide in a room and call them.
706.0,Provider,I told you to go hide in a room and call them when he comes near you.
16869.0,Patient,"yep yeah when it comes to my house and drives by and I haven't actually spoke to them, because I was speaking to I was trying to get in touch with you yesterday when this all happened, so I was waiting."
706.0,Provider,To police and I was like geez I hope everything's okay.
16869.0,Patient,"yeah so I didn't even get to contact them they contact Dave contacted them for me while I was on the phone and he kind of spoke and I haven't called them back either, so I need to call them and tell them myself. That what he's been doing. He they heard it from Dave because I was sitting there, telling them what to say and whatnot, but I still need to talk to the arresting officer. And let them know hey i've got multiple messages multiple missed calls it's driving by going to my friend's House like this is. This is a bit much now you guys need to go arrest him like. him."
706.0,Provider,yeah does he come to your door or does he.
16869.0,Patient,"know he stays in his car but he's drive like the street, you can see right off my porch. And you can tell us right out there through the window or the door like he just stops in front of my house on the road and just sits there. or i'll sit at this stop sign now he hasn't yet today, but when I got off work, last night I got home around 10 and I seen him in town here driving through the square of town and Dave my husband was watching her he said he had heard his car all night driving around here. He has nothing to do but drive around he has nowhere to go there's no job."

706.0,Provider,"up there, we go."
16869.0,Patient,There we go yep.
706.0,Provider,"So I mean if you don't feel safe why aren't the police doing anything I mean there's was to protect and serve you know they feel safe in your own home, you would think that they would do something."
16869.0,Patient,"No, I don't know how it goes, I mean that's something else, I have to figure out today i'm like in Crawford county i'm in richland county now. But in Crawford county I went to be cyrus after I got out of the hospital in August, and I was trying to get a restraining order against him, then a civil protective stocking order. But I gave them his address that he reported to him and he's on he's on parole to he just uses when he was in prison for nine years he's out on parole he's still got a couple more months on that, but he's been lying to his parole officer on his address and stuff. So."
706.0,Provider,"I don't know, maybe you call the parole officer and say."
16869.0,Patient,"hi you could do that. And then the you cyrus was the other county they couldn't get the address right they couldn't find them the Sheriff so they couldn't serve him, so I didn't get up cpo. And then we started talking again, and so I don't know if it's the same process in this town, because he got one against me just by telling the police, a lie. But I don't know if I can get one through the police as well, or if I have to go through the courts in mansfield."
706.0,Provider,uh huh wow.
16869.0,Patient,or us we'd be. Complicated yeah it's a lot to do.
706.0,Provider,"it's a lot to deal with, and through all of this you're doing Okay, the one you're mad you're not feeling like any cravings or any. triggers or anything like that."

16869.0,Patient,"You like seeing yourself, you weren't even looking."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness she's adorable."
16869.0,Patient,"I wish I didn't have to work, I mean I didn't At first I didn't have to go back when I went back to work, but you know I kind of have to I was doing it to keep my sanity and get out of the House away from Eric and Dave because they were both at the trailer with me."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
16869.0,Patient,But now i'm just missing so much like I don't know I don't work very much I only work three days a week.
706.0,Provider,"But they grow a lot, you know they grow quickly and. yeah I know. that's the nice thing, though, about all the you know all the phones or smartphones and you can record all of this stuff that's what I was, I told it has my son's daycare when he started. Going back to daycare and doing stuff you know to record it and send it to me because I didn't want them to feel like."
16869.0,Patient,A little right.
706.0,Provider,So that's Nice and at least her husband's the one that watches are so he can.
16869.0,Patient,yeah it's either him or my friend Aaron and that's the place he Eric showed up was that errands house she work.
706.0,Provider,So you're afraid that he might take her.
16869.0,Patient,Oh yeah absolutely we're all afraid that he's going to kidnap her he has to kidnapping charges some aggravated robbery charge he's got like seven seven.
706.0,Provider,What seriously Why is he not being picked up.
16869.0,Patient,"This is exactly he should have been arrested days ago, the day they let me out, they should have went and arrested him because I made a statement on him as well, like what really happened."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
16869.0,Patient,"Like we got we did get physical, but I definitely didn't punch him close fisted in the face, he he ended up pushing me down spitting at my face, but that was when he was talking, he was so upset spit was coming out you didn't like purposely spit on me. But with me, making a statement they really should have went picked him up. yeah and since then he's been not following through they've advised him, just like they did me to stay away from each other."
706.0,Provider,Well yeah I no contact order is just what it is and no contact order um. yeah so is he on the birth certificate.
16869.0,Patient,"No, no, nobody is. My husband was. Just because we're married. And then, when. Eric took the paternity test it removed David from the birth certificate now it's just me on there and I don't want to put anybody on it Dave wants to be back on it, but I don't want anybody on it."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well. The one, the one thing they depend, I mean it goes State to State so in iowa the biological Father um has just as much right to the child as the biological mother."
16869.0,Patient,that's not in Ohio.
706.0,Provider,"So that's that's how it is here, so I mean like literally a father can take a child. And then the mother has to. go to court to fight to get their child back, because unless there's something established as far as visitation."
16869.0,Patient,"Both right well rights. that's how it is with me and Dave because we're married, but with me and Eric. that's not the case Ohio is a mother state."
706.0,Provider,"yeah I want is not. Equal rights and so i've watched people have to fight to get the kids that they've raised, you know for three years back, because the father takes them. wow yeah so it's it's it's pretty crazy but that's good that they're that's not the case, because. Otherwise nag term, you would have to fight to get her back this way her he'll be arrested and."
16869.0,Patient,"you'll get more kidnapping charge felony I will definitely press charges, I was scared when my son was about I don't know definitely under three my mother in law took him what happened."
706.0,Provider,How the camera went off.
16869.0,Patient,"I don't know hold on a minute. I don't know where you went. There you are. girl there we go. On, but I would hear me and my husband went to Virginia West Virginia and I left him there we got in a fight and I left in there. Well, his mom went to go pick them up when I got back and she took Henry whether. My son and he was maybe two a year I don't I don't know how old he was really young and I I almost filed kidnapping charges on her because she didn't have my permission to take them out of State to go pick Dave up. That was terrifying when that happens, so I could imagine."
706.0,Provider,"Absolutely so yeah, the best thing that you can do is just go through all the legal means you know just talk to the police there and just let them know that you're terrified and you have an infant and you're kind of vulnerable, so they need to protect you. serve and protect."
16869.0,Patient,yeah I have a friend one person in this town that I know and he is licensed to own a gun open concealed carry or whatever it is. I called him up when Eric was driving by yesterday he rushed over Dave my husband rushed over from galleon. Her actually cross line they got here. Because like I said I was on the phone with you guys like on your waiting room thing. I could do much. But I felt pretty safe once they got here and it's he just lives two minutes down the road so.
706.0,Provider,"that's good, well, we should have somebody there that can help you and be."
16869.0,Patient,Exactly yeah.
706.0,Provider,All by yourself that'd be really scary.
16869.0,Patient,"yeah I know it is, it is because nobody's here with me now. yeah somebody at any minute."
706.0,Provider,"yeah just keep your doors locked keeper when windows lacked and on you, at all times. Right he'll get caught and you know they'll revoke his parole and. right if he's on parole I wouldn't be i'm going to be messing around, and I was on parole I don't know what."
16869.0,Patient,happened he's stupid i'm going to call his parole officer and my friend Aaron is as well and we're going to report what he's been doing for the past two years and see what his parole officer asked you and see if he he had drug test them and see if it is.
706.0,Provider,yeah well drug testing i'm also I mean stocking.
16869.0,Patient,and
706.0,Provider,"You know, like you've said there's no contact order he's breaking that that's. Right legal to do."

Like we gotta fight me and lucky took off he set up a camera an old phone in my bedroom hidden and I didn't know about it and I got out of the shower got dressed in my room and I felt so violated when he did that. Like I should have recorded that I mean there's so many times that he's really just been dirty."
706.0,Provider,"yeah that's yeah that's kind of crossing the line for sure. yeah I mean come, you know, have a safety plan so like if this happens, you know, like so obviously you have that person that lives in town that you can call you know so. Make sure that you have kind of that safety plan of i'm going to call this person i'm going to call this person i'm going to call the police like. You know, when you as a mother get that weird feeling in the pit of your stomach and your gut always listen to that you know, like if you feel something's not right always listen to that because.
