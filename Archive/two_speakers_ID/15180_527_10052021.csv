15180.0,Patient,"Oh no questions at all, thank you for everything."

Just overall as a person, and you know if anything comes up as far as symptoms, do you ever do you have manic symptoms."
15180.0,Patient,I did I did in the past. But I kind of overcame and I didn't have as much anymore.

15180.0,Patient,"No, not at all."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, any history of homicidal thoughts or attempts to harm anybody."
15180.0,Patient,"else, no. No, no."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, any history of self harm behaviors like cutting yourself hitting burning okay okay so i'm sure you've probably been asked that many times, or you know for. Just a mental health status check, so I always just like to review, even if there hasn't been any history of it, you know if that would ever change certainly. You would want to get to the hospital for an assessment to see if they would need to hospital hospitalized you for a short stay to get that stabilized. You know, you can always call 911 if you can't get there safely, you know transported or have anybody to transport you to the hospital. And then you know I always just educate on the suicide hotline number they've made it really simple now it's just a three digit number it's 988 so I always just like to give that as a crisis line if if that should be needed. So, but it doesn't sound like there's been any any history of any of that or anything currently going on, so that's good. I may occasionally check in with you on that, but to see if that's changed, I know, certainly, sometimes working on treatment issues can bring up different feelings and emotions, so I always want to make sure. You know you're doing okay as well and staying staying stable with the medications and the therapy as well. Okay yeah yeah and then do you have any questions about the program or groups."
15180.0,Patient,or no everything's pretty straightforward.
527.0,Provider,"And okay okay okay good I was going to look to see what group, you are you're on Mondays at five out of five yeah Okay, so what we'll do then ricky is we'll schedule our appointments. And then we'll schedule um they won't be able to schedule on Monday sincerity have group so we'll schedule them on a different day. And there's a couple different options we can do, I can we have like half our appointments you know therapy appointments if you feel like that's enough time for you. We can always do an hour appointment and if you know if if you feel like that's you know what you would. need or you know, for some reason we schedule it and you don't use the whole time that's Okay, too, but we can kind of play around with depending on, you know how how you're doing or what you need. As far as the length of time for first sessions for us and usually we do."
15180.0,Patient,An hour to be good.
527.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and then we usually do two times a month and then you've got your groups in there and then you do you see chantel for your. For medication okay. yep and so you'll see her. I don't know if you have I was looking to see if he has an appointment scheduled with her yeah it looks like you met with her initially probably and then. yeah So if you have to see her outside a group for any medication issues or concerns that you can always schedule an individual appointment with her. If you need to have more one on one time versus the group setting. With her yeah yeah so. Alright, so do you know what your hours are going to be with your new job."
