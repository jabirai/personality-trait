705.0,Provider,"You got it Ryan. A great one. Thank you. bye bye so patient had to use a pass code to get in and also to patient as far as suicide it's still low risk. Because he did try to act on it back in May and so he was having you know thoughts about going off the cliff he had made a plan, but then he didn't do it. But even with that knowledge, we still went ahead and did a safety plan, just in case he needs it so right now i'm going to continue to to monitor, but it would be low risk for suicide ideation. And he also denied I have any homicidal thoughts, he did say that, at times, he has hearing things, but it was more about suffering, and when I asked it was more about suffering and gel so that might be something if it changes that will monitor."
