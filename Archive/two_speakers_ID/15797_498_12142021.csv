498.0,Provider,Recording and started this is an individual medication follow up for Theresa NGO admitting the patient.
15797.0,Patient,hi.
498.0,Provider,"Hello there verify your name, date of birth, for me."
15797.0,Patient,727 83 Teresa no.
498.0,Provider,Very good okay So how are we doing with the 20 milligrams today.
15797.0,Patient,"um it's it was better than the 10 it's it's better than 10 for sure um. I. mean there's been a little bit of change, I."
498.0,Provider,What.
15797.0,Patient,"Not too much focus a little bit better i'm doing more stuff than I was able to on the 10. But i'm not sure what. If there were any major differences um it does it's it's definitely different from return, though I guess i'm not sure what i'm expecting."
498.0,Provider,"that's what that was my next question because you don't wake up like. You don't wake up and feel like you've taken a blue pill okay. And it is some it's it's a gradual noticing that you know i've checked off a few more things on my list. My to do list. Actually, you know recall a more of what I was looking over the next you know the last hour you get you'll find yourself. kind of going through what you last look that so it's not it's not a magic pill, but it will offer you a slight boost so. that's my question, what do you do notice a slight improvement."
15797.0,Patient,A slight improvement yeah sure.
498.0,Provider,Any. Any intolerable side effects.
15797.0,Patient,"Nothing intolerable, not that I know of. i'm like keeping track of my blood pressure and keeping track of my heart rate, it does elevate a bit. It did, for the first few days and then I noticed the heart rate sees elevated but my blood pressure isn't as elevated now, so I mean that's a good thing. But I guess i'm not sure what. change would look like."
498.0,Provider,Okay okay um. Tell me. What about sleep any difficulty with falling asleep.
15797.0,Patient,"No, no, because you mentioned that it was a 12 hour kind of effect, so I take it, the first thing I do when I get out of bed so that way, by the time the 12 hours is over i'll have at least a few more hours before actually having to go to bed so. That helps with not really having trouble with sleep."
498.0,Provider,We feel like it's wearing off to prematurely during the day.
15797.0,Patient,"i'm not I don't know if i'm seeing this right, but it feels like i'm almost there like. Sometimes when I pair it with like coffee or something like that just. All like listen to a history and then i'm having thoughts in my head, but then i'm noticing that i'm still able to understand what they're saying to me, even though i'm having my own thoughts, though i'm like is this one one more people function. So i'm not sure about that term normal anymore."
498.0,Provider,i'll forewarn you on that one and tell me.
15797.0,Patient,"But I mean it's nice when I those those like moments, where I have my own thoughts, but i'm simultaneously able to listen to what someone else is saying. that's helpful, but like. Almost I don't know again i'm not sure what i'm expecting but like i'm just curious on maybe it's the extended release or I have no idea, again I haven't tried anything else. So i'm just curious on like what a different dose would do, or maybe I just need to get more used to this one, I have no idea."
498.0,Provider,"What the one of the reasons why I asked you did you feel like the medication wore off, you know toward the end of the day, because you have such a lengthy day and the ir the immediate release is an option. Because it's dosed twice a day since, of course, it's half life is a little shorter."
15797.0,Patient,You don't.
498.0,Provider,"feel like i'm you know early in the day when you first take it, you know you're still kind of in that magic space and then later on in the evening the attention is kind of waning than that that's an option, you can still go up another five easily. To 25 to see if that's a. Good space for you, but before making a decision like that you need to ascertain whether or not you feel like it's. You feel like it's effective for an adequate duration throughout the day. And then, if you want to go up overall or if you feel like you're okay for certain part of the day, but you'd like to extend that period."
15797.0,Patient,"The thing is, like, I imagine that the the immediate release one would probably give me or probably be sufficient for like the morning, but then, because my days can be kind of long i'm worried about having to. have another one in the middle of the day and I don't know how long it takes to. Have the effect or like I don't. I don't want that break in the middle of the day, where it's coming down and something else is coming up. On at least that's what imagine it would be like, if I had to. break the middle of the day, to have another."
498.0,Provider,Secondary dose.
15797.0,Patient,"yeah so I want to see if I could stay on the the extended. If possible, but maybe. see what it would be like, if I could. adjust a little bit and. Her I don't know what do you think."
498.0,Provider,"How many days now, have we done the 20."
15797.0,Patient,"milligrams been a week now, I think."
498.0,Provider,What was the last time you visit your therapist.
15797.0,Patient,"The last time was a a few days before you spoke to him. The appointment was supposed to be for Friday, but that got cancelled and got pushed back again so i'm making my appointments I promise you."
498.0,Provider,"They just kept telling me. off yeah Oh, I know. it's kind of like the going joke around here. But yeah I think my last appointment with you supposed to be last week."
15797.0,Patient,But it got rescheduled to next week.
498.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, how do you feel about our. i'll give you another seven days at 20 and give me one second double check something here. Okay. i'll give you another seven days at the 20 and because it looks like you got a 30 day supply at the 20 milligrams and then. Just to see if if there's any room if if there is any improvement over the next week that's two weeks at. 20 milligrams and then. i'll check in with if you could just report to manny or send me an email with regard to how the next seven days go. Any improvements anywhere. In combination of course with your strategies from cycle."
15797.0,Patient,Derby.
498.0,Provider,"or some, but if you continue to not perceive any. benefit with regard to the continuation of the 20. milligrams and we can go ahead and go up to the 2530 is typically Max for the extended release. Okay, it may be, it may be that you need to go to the er and maybe that 25 is just more appropriate those for you, because you're looking to manage and balance so so many tasks."
15797.0,Patient,"Go ahead, he possible to try the and then tell him how things are going at the next meeting, or do you think it's better to see how it goes for another week and then switch the."
498.0,Provider,"only reason I would make an attempt to continue for another week is because you with California cures, you may run into an issue with an additional prescription a week after your last prescription. it's it's already going to. Act and already kind of force the having to kind of circumvent. Some of the year. And again, like it's just been seven days, I would like to see some improvement after about three days of at the 20 milligrams but again I mean you are when you have a high stress high demand and responsibility on a daily basis, and then a stimulant. Especially a low dose stimulants. Can seem like it it, it can be perceived to not offer any real benefit because you're already kind of operating at a high level of task management. So, in order for you to move from one level to the next, it could you know, requires some continue, you said you know we could just give it another couple of days, or we just may need to take you up another five milligrams. And so i'm i'm I could support either one of those strategies, but before we take you up I like to give this another seven days and then just make a decision from there."
15797.0,Patient,Okay Julie. Oh sorry my meeting with him is on. The 21st so exactly seven days from. i'll just let him know how it goes and.
498.0,Provider,i'll be in contact with him what time is your appointment with meaning.
15797.0,Patient,"It eight oh crap I have to change the meeting. I might have to change the meeting with them it's at eight in the morning, but I. My uncle just died, and I have to fly out that morning. i'm gonna have to change that meeting, so I don't know what i'm going to have to change it to his first his next first appointment okay."
498.0,Provider,"send me an email them. Okay, if you change that appointment and it stuck it out past the 21st, then you can feel free to send me an email, do you have my email address."
15797.0,Patient,"I can you give it to me, just in case."
498.0,Provider,i'm actually sending it to you in the chat so you can just cut and paste it.
15797.0,Patient,"Perfect okay um I will let you know, is about a week and. If not, before then, then I can tell you how it's been going to this email."
498.0,Provider,So you just send me a check an email to let me know same a little bit better you know no change is you know just something quick okay.
15797.0,Patient,"Okay okay that's good and then, if I if, after about seven days, it does seem like me they wanted to try the 25 then Am I gonna have to make another appointment with you, or are you sending."
498.0,Provider,"out what i'll do is based on your feedback, I have a career navigator reach out to you to bring you in to the clinic probably no later than next Wednesday. Just. up into the bringing like send you a link to join me into the clinic. And that out i'll make the revision from the year so i'll basically probably unlikely create an appointment in order to invite you to the clinic a lot like we did today."
15797.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
498.0,Provider,"Now community, I had the care navigator reach out to you on Tuesday with regard to the link when you can expect it and went to meet me on the following day, if not the same day."
15797.0,Patient,"Okay, all right great and really good question. The link it says bright without the T, so you."
498.0,Provider,know I just typed too fast right.
