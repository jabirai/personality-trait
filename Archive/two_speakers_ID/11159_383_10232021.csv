11159.0,Patient,"same thing as last time I do my other job tonight i'm so only have like 25 minutes, maybe 20. I did. I did pull over this time, so I drove to a 711."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, do you mind touching your camera down, so I can feel a little. bit more."
11159.0,Patient,"Oh yes, I was also late cuz I got up exactly at five, so I didn't have time to like go into the virtual clinic and Okay, but i'm here. i'm."
383.0,Provider,A new contact and operational clinic after appointment and just to check in.
11159.0,Patient,Oh yeah I checked in already.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, you did okay."
11159.0,Patient,But I checked in late. So I checked in at 503. Okay um so hi i'm back again. Okay um. i've been feeling really like what the depersonalization and the realization was definitely last time.
383.0,Provider,You talked about it with me yeah last.
11159.0,Patient,"Time okay so that's how long it's been it's already been almost a month that i've been feeling this right catchy get off they get scary me. Like I can hear myself talk and I, I know that i'm talking but it feels like i'm in a stimulation like it's not me or like it's me but it's I can see me from I can explain like I need but not me like I could watch myself almost in third person. And I can hear myself, but I know that it's me talking but like I could hear my own voice talk as if someone else's hearing me talk like if I was someone else."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, so. You know you don't have from what you described, and you can correct me if i'm wrong because you're you know you're living your life so you please correct me and you are really, really very, very busy right you're working two jobs. Yes, and so you don't have you know you're out you're on demand, your your meeting expectations at your workplace and you don't have much downtime to connect with yourself, you know to. Go for walks to you know just relax to. to connect with you you're just on the go, so this is not a very balanced kind of lifestyle, because you really need your meeting the expectations of your employer, which in a sense, it's kind of it's not depersonalization or D realization but. you're it's very performative if you need to kind of perform and be on and show up and."
11159.0,Patient,"got you though. it's actually it's kind of the opposite, because when i'm at work, I don't really think about it, like when i'm with the kids at elementary school as well, I don't think about how the way i'm feeling because i'm so busy. In my work i'm distracted I don't have time to think with my own thoughts it's, I feel that way, the most is when i'm home. When i'm by myself when i'm with my partner whenever my family like windows when the setting is when the waves are calm that's when I start feeling that way and I get freaked out."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
11159.0,Patient,So what does that mean.
383.0,Provider,"Well, I mean. it's uncomfortable for you, because you're saying."
11159.0,Patient,Man you.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're in the driver's seat and i'm just here, to see if I can help you know support you and feeling better. you're the one that's feeling your feelings so."
11159.0,Patient,"that's scary because I feel like. I don't know like what if I do something dangerous, then I feel like because I think it's not real. But his room."
383.0,Provider,Right well that's. Why like without real consequences.
11159.0,Patient,Because I feel like everything is a stimulation.
383.0,Provider,Do you play a lot of video games are you are.
11159.0,Patient,"No, no."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so you want to be reminding yourself with your thoughts like you know, this is my real life i'm in control of my life I am choosing what to say I the wind, that is, on my face is real the rain that is falling right now is you know i'm. A real water, it can. Be you know you want to remind yourself that you are. These are real experience. yeah."
11159.0,Patient,"that's what I try to do for the most part, I try to stay like like it's on your head like stop thinking about that, like it's like getting your head to stop like I try to. Stop myself and get thinking too much into it, because I know if I do, I like think myself into a panic attack so i'm aware that I feel that way, but I don't try to like sit on it for too long. But the fact that I keep having to like redirect my brain over and over and over is bothering me the fact, because I have to do that, so I know it's there because I have to redirect. Like the amount of time that the redirect throughout the day is very, very concerning. Like I don't let myself get that far, because I i've done that bar it's not a pretty place. Okay scared of being there."
383.0,Provider,"Right right um you know, I think it would be good to have to talk to is chantel doing maybe assisting you, with your medications."
11159.0,Patient,"So can I medication when I need for that, I mean I really take on the faxing and limit, though."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think it still would be good to talk to your prescriber about these symptoms I don't know if there is something that is maybe more helpful for those symptoms or not, but it still would be good to update her on the increase in these symptoms. Just so she knows, so you know I don't know if this like i'm not that's what my specialization, but it would be good for her to know that these."
11159.0,Patient,"What i'm describing is that depersonalization. That. My dad was telling me that, like last year haven't even mentioned this to her, and he."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yes, it is, it is a form of that. I think that the more you can do to. Ground yourself, we talked about it, you know, last time in. Your reality and like, especially when you're doing things like cooking or. You know, communicating with other people in your not in your work life and in your real life, and knowing that your words have impact, so if you're mean it's going to hurt someone if you're kind and thoughtful and consider it people are going to feel good in your life if you. enjoy a meal, you know you want to be really enjoying it and saying you know, this is a good crunchy taco or you know or, this is a really nice milkshake i'm enjoying this in this moment, this is a real moment that i'm having, but I do think that, because you're working a lot, it could be. Making you a little more vulnerable to this and and your sleep is impacted as well you know you're you're not really, as you mentioned, you know there you're you're on the job, sometimes at night."
11159.0,Patient,"yeah tonight i'll be on the job and then tomorrow I work during the day, but like for 12 hours. And 12 hours again on Sunday and and 12 hours going on Monday. At 8888 8am to 8pm."
383.0,Provider,"that's a lot to put on yourself and to. You know, ask yourself to kind of be compromised in terms of sleep wake schedule and. not really get like I said, you know not really getting your downtime meaning your rest and your recovery."
11159.0,Patient,And I still want to go to the gym.
383.0,Provider,yeah definitely and not getting your exercise in.
11159.0,Patient,"And I mean I tried to go to the gym, but when I go to the gym i'm sacrificing my sleep."
383.0,Provider,Right.
11159.0,Patient,"I don't know like yesterday, I want you to gym but I didn't even sleep at all, because I had to go to work, and I use my nap time to go to the gym but I get depressed because I gained 15 pounds because I work so much. And then I get depressed if I don't sleep."
383.0,Provider,I know you're in a tough situation yeah.
11159.0,Patient,"yeah in a position to not have these jobs. Because I need to get myself out of debt like. I really like and if I don't have both jobs it threat, I mean I live in I live in Los Angeles. Right now it's expensive."
383.0,Provider,I know I know life in California is really expensive I can attest to that because I live here too and.
11159.0,Patient,yeah and then I went to New York last week for like four days.
383.0,Provider,How was your trip.
11159.0,Patient,"It was good. My work didn't get my give me a pre my time off so headlines and slogan, but it was fun."

Because i'm watching it on your console as a kid and she knows that my older sister and she's like you want to call me. And I said, like no I can't like my does will never allow me and she's like come on let's just go just we'll just figure it out, and then I said no, but then she's like okay i'll just buy your flight ticket and you're going to go and she's like if I buy your ticket where you go. And I said okay fine I said fine two months ago, then I. The month, a month before I was getting closer the. month for you and I said getting really nervous, because I was getting anxiety that I couldn't get the time off I just started a new job I just started my job at the kids like three months ago. And I knew that I was not in the best seat, with my caregiving job because. I never say yes, they want they wanted me to work extra even more they they're annoyed that changed my schedule, because I have another job, so I felt like I was not in the I was in hot water with them, and I was still new with my school job."
383.0,Provider,sounds like.
11159.0,Patient,"it's not the time for me to go right now I can't go and she's like well too bad because, since you said that you're going to go I bought. Our Nice, the ticket she's only 17 under age and then she's like who's going out with an account leave her in a different state in the airbnb will we go to drink at the bars like you have to stay with her. Now she can go and we can't refund the tickets so, then I was like okay fine I was getting like around because my sister was getting mad at me. Because I basically wasting your money, and then I got my nice excited for no reason, so I was like yeah now I need to go now other people are going to go down, so I told my job. The two weeks before one of my jobs that. was actually a week before. The school job that I have an emergency that I need to go to New York, because I need to be able to see my niece. was technically was not a lie, I did have to go to take care of my nice but it wasn't emergency, but it was kind of emergency, because if I don't go she can go, which is an emergency that 17 year olds eyes, I just bend the truth. Man for my other job I knew they're gonna say no, because they always request time off. i'm just for the weekend, or even if it's like couple hours for them it's time off because it's not what they want that's not what they say so isn't that goes beyond what they want me to do is time off so. I requested time off the month before for to the weekends, because I had to go for the weekend up North for my God dad his birthday and then the next weekend was my best friend's birthday, so I was there, so. I had to like come up with the idea, so I told him I covered and then I have to get some positive test results, the point is, I did lie i'm not happy about it but i'm happy that I got to go in a secret that only mean you know, and my family."
383.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I am so glad that you gave that to yourself, because it seems like you really, really needed some fun and to relax or just to just have fun, you know."
11159.0,Patient,"be something was i'm so happy that I got to experience that and even though I spent a lot of money, I mean, then, again I work, for I work really hard, why not. Do something and I want to."
383.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I mean life, you need to live life and life, you know it's like this. about meeting responsibilities but it's also about having fun every now and then, and then good fun, you know healthy fun not unhealthy fun where you're hurting other people hurting yourself so."
11159.0,Patient,"that's true, but that was good, and then, but my depersonalization and that's going on in my life, and then you go to New York. i'm sorry i'm playing. i'm. I have been really. On edge and aggressive and like. a ticking time bomb with my partner, and she noticed it and I select because i'm under so much stress and easily like fused and physical I don't know. But she's getting like the really bad end of the stick and I feel like it's really ruining my relationship and I don't know how to help it and I feel like we're like. going down deal she's not she's not only my partner she's my fiance like we're gonna get married, so this is the 911 emergency situation."
383.0,Provider,"well. You know that you're working to access and you. You need you made that choice. But you have to choose yourself some times too, so you want to look at your calendar and see when do you have downtime when do you have time to relax when. Do you have time to sleep to recover, so you are not on edge, because you know we're all going to be you and anybody that works and doesn't sleep enough, is going to be on edge and that's going to make you. You know, different people it's going to make them, you know from what you're saying you experience being feeling more aggressive and feeling more irritable probably and. So you want to make some choices, so that you can decompress and take care of yourself and then you can choose to respond in less aggressive ways to your loved ones are the people that you're close to you know your partner. Mainly so."
11159.0,Patient,Maybe I should ask for less hours at least one of my jobs. A man was walking by me. yeah she won't be asked her less hours.
383.0,Provider,"yeah I mean look at your schedule and you kind of can. see where can you Maybe you can take a Wednesday off or. Sometimes you can tell on call jobs, you know i'm available two times a month on you know for the weekends and then two times a month i'm not available. You know you don't have to be available for for people when they say you can tell them when what your availability is."
11159.0,Patient,"I just feel bad because I don't like I don't know how to say no to people I just I just want everyone to be happy, so I just say yeah they recently like change my schedule around so now. I work in the daytime or nighttime so which was better, for me, because otherwise I was working I had some clients, where I can just sleep. And now I have to work in the daytime and I cannot do that and they said yes."
383.0,Provider,"Okay well you that's about learning boundaries, and if you talk to your other therapist from time to time. Maybe you can talk about boundaries because and learning how to say no."
11159.0,Patient,bs in. The morning relationship side. I kind of us are more for like relationship advice actually. Because I realized he probably didn't even talked about work i'm always talking about some relationship i've been with them for three years and she's seeing a lot of relationships. Starting crumble on there.
383.0,Provider,"I see. well. You can talk to her about work boundaries to you know setting letting people know when you're available and when you're not and you have that right to. You know, set those boundaries at the workplace."
11159.0,Patient,You should try and part of.
383.0,Provider,"Well, you just you. as adults, you know when we're young we tend to think that other people are. You know, were younger and adults are in control when we become more mature you realize you're one of those adults that are actually in control of your own life. So you decide, and you choose and you say yes to things and sometimes you say no to things because you're in control of your own self and your own life. And so you. Are you okay."
11159.0,Patient,"that's just weird dialing talk to me in front of the 711 so i'm just gonna. have to leave anyway cuz it's. Pretty, so I think you."
383.0,Provider,"All right, take care yourself I can't do I can't do session with you, while you're driving."
