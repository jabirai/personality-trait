The last time I signed in, but it was too late, I missed you for a minute, and then they were like no just to let you have to reschedule and then there was something on your end time before that so it's been a brief minute since i've seen you."
207.0,Provider,what's been going on. There sorry before the holiday.
2524.0,Patient,"yup yup i'm. Just work, really, I mean the kids cope, it is rampant through our city again and the schools and the whole wrestling team just got it so we just spent days in quarantine and got back out of that. So all the fun stuff that comes with that, but other than that, I mean."
207.0,Provider,The baby is born oh.
2524.0,Patient,yeah yeah babies born baby is he's kind of a sick little guy he just gets. Every cold and anything he can possibly pick up he gets it so.
207.0,Provider,that's good.
2524.0,Patient,No he's a he just he just turned a little over a year just over a year now so he's like I think 13 or 14 months old.

2524.0,Patient,"He was getting married. baby was already here and then he was getting married and. They did go through with the marriage and they are married now but. It just ironic how things work out and like anything and everything that could have went wrong for their wedding and the reception did his dad got mixed up on the time and lives out of state or out of town like two hours away so he ended up was late for the wedding miss the actual. wedding itself showed up for the reception and the caterers messed up. The DJ never did show. They found some friends to come and make do as a DJ and when they did that. The weather rained and rained and rained and rained terrible well, then they finally you know okay we're going to get a few dances in any ways, whether permit whatever we're just going to go with the flow and the bride as she was walking across the."
207.0,Provider,People. don't tell me.
2524.0,Patient,"Oh, my God. She fell and she left in an ambulance with a broken hip pelvis and she was down for six weeks so. Like newborn baby get married has to leave your own wedding not just leave, but like leave and come home in a wheelchair like three or four days later. and was unable to walk for six weeks was in that wheelchair, so I mean it was rough it was rough I felt so bad for them guys and like when I talked to him i'm just like. I am so sorry like he was like anything and everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong, I cannot tell you every like it's just unbelievable the amount of stuff that went wrong like oh my God so."
207.0,Provider,suspicious and something.
2524.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know I mean it was the universe was not trying to tell you something do it, I don't know."
207.0,Provider,Who I am because i'm thinking like God is trying to tell you.
2524.0,Patient,"You know, and then yeah I mean it's just yeah wow just wow."
207.0,Provider,So you when.
2524.0,Patient,We made it through of that I did show my face very briefly i'm more is just the respect for the kids kinda.
207.0,Provider,"But how was it for you, how was it for you."
2524.0,Patient,"i'm okay i've done a lot of. Really digging deep some of the conversations that you and I had and. You kind of like put some things into perspective and light for me that. I didn't really necessarily want to hear, but I I did know and when that happened it's kind of like okay so i'm gonna have to work through these things as bad as I don't want to. i'm just gonna have to I can't keep them buried away forever and they do affect me. And my day to day life, it does it's it's it's eye opening, but it does. And the relationship now you know, like, I told you, is is on and off on and off on enough and. It seems like the. ons are getting closer. And the mobs are fewer and far between and I am petrified like I want to just run shut it down nope because I don't want to be heard, I don't want to go through that. Myself like well that's. that's my old way of dealing with things Ashley so probably not the greatest way to deal with it and try but. I don't know I struggle with that one now because I still stand by that saying and acts as an exploration."
207.0,Provider,"But is it that you need Okay, so I think you did admit that there is still some love there for him, because he had been with him for a while all your children or with him right. yeah and how many children, you have a two or three."
2524.0,Patient,"yeah, we have to."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and you guys work together for how long."
2524.0,Patient,married for 10 together for 12.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's a long time, and was it a mutual agreement to separate or one person just pay that's it."
2524.0,Patient,"No, it was it was kind of mutual at the end, we had did the. break up on mutually and then we get back together, and then it was this back and forth back and forth, and then he went out of State to work and then why he was out of state working it was just kind of like yeah don't come off we're probably not come back here. And let's see what happens and when he did actually come back in. and got back to Michigan his priorities were so many other places it wasn't about trying to fix our marriage or spend time with the kids so it was just best at that point, I walked away he walked away and we never ended up getting back together, it was one of them things."
207.0,Provider,"But there's that that you still had he still held a place in your heart, regardless of you guys physically being together."
2524.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
207.0,Provider,Because he went through a lot now even. seeing him. saying these or did they even get the chance to say.
2524.0,Patient,"Yes, they didn't make it through the the ceremony, and the reception they made it through all of that, but like I was like 930 when she fell and by 10 o'clock the ambulance was there, take."
207.0,Provider,Towards the end towards the end of the whole thing that all of that happened yeah it was it was an outdoor wedding.
2524.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it rained all day they didn't they didn't get to do. Like that any of the dancing stuff and then they didn't get to do the cake, for whatever reason, the cake hadn't been done, I was like that was so late, I don't understand why you didn't have the cake, but that's not neither here, but so the cake stayed on."
207.0,Provider,"Oh throughout all of that, just to watch it just to watch all of it unfold, regardless of the mishap for the catastrophes and all of that for you to watch him devote himself to another to watch him say these things for another to watch him gives himself for another. Day were you already resolved within yourself that i'm happy for him or did there was there's a part that reservation to watch this happen."
2524.0,Patient,"yeah no I definitely had to reserve i'm in that there was a power. I cried cried my eyes out. i'm. seeing it, you know what I mean seeing it being there, making it. it's 100 100% official she has our last name now she's i'm not the wife i'm the ex wife now she's the wife she's an official step mother to my children. But at the same time i'm so happy for them i'm so happy because."
207.0,Provider,"He was robbing within yourself, this is the reality that i'll never get him back."
2524.0,Patient,"not right and I know that i've knew that. Before the map, I guess that was just kind of like the nail in the coffin sealed the. deal like okay he's somebody's husband now. It got it was just that whole official mess, but at the same time."
207.0,Provider,Am.
2524.0,Patient,"very happy very, very, very happy um. But it was just like the probably because I didn't deal with this stuff at the time when I should have years ago when we split up. I just blocked it all the way and closed it out, it was easier to do it that way, then, to deal with it so that's what I did, and we all know, not healthy, you know."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm and I think there is and again, if you think about from a from a and I think sometimes we minimize certain things like where where does certain emotion come from and Is it normal for us to feel a certain way, it is absolutely normal, but we have to understand, as women, we are givers. We give of ourselves, we give everything and when we love we love everything we like i'm literally taking my heart and i'm handing it to you. And when you you do like your you left a scar there. And so, even though I know that the reality is that we cannot physically be together, yes, we have to co parent, yes, I have to see you all the time. And every time I see you and communicate with you, it is a reminder of what I was giving to you, and that was not necessarily it was it didn't remain sacred. So as a from that from a from a woman's perspective, it is just like I am happy that you're Moving on, I am happy that you're doing what you're doing but there's still that part of me. That I need to this moon needs to heal within me and that's only something that you alone can do, nobody else can do it for you. Because, in your opinion, a she at least good to your children."
2524.0,Patient,"Yes, yes she's very good to the kids very, very good to the kids she. I, I do have to say, like I don't I don't hold no grudges against her because she's really. Not did anything she's never made the kids feel different her family even her family has been like amazing from day one. When they first got together, it was right around the holiday time and, and you know things get funny when you go to different peoples holiday gatherings and there's gifts exchanged and. You know, maybe oh that new boyfriend and oh oh my God he showed up with two extra kids and we don't have a gift or you know I don't know but from the very beginning, they was always included."
207.0,Provider,equal to.
2524.0,Patient,"The other ones in the family, there was no different it wasn't like oh shoot their step or redheaded children over there in the corner. shunned away, they were always included and made to feel a part of the family. um so I never had any complaints, the kids were old enough to to come home and relay that message, and let me know that you know know hey they're all cool they're good people. So that it made it very easy on that aspect it's it's like you said it's all stuff within myself and i'm 34 years old, and I just realized within the last six months. I cannot give up or let go of people, even if they literally take my heart and walk all over it use it like a doormat stood on it on the way out, I still find it in my heart to forgive them and it's a horrible. thing to like that, because you know better, you know. Better and that's. When we were talking in group that day and that's what I just said, like. Even if you know better, sometimes you still don't act on it, you still."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2524.0,Patient,Because I know that. You know self love self worth. respect all of that. But I choose to just. I don't know.
207.0,Provider,"We find sometimes we find comfort in holding on to unforgiveness sometimes we find comfort, is it healthy no it's not. But it's just like if I say well you know you'd like you're saying Michelle you need to let it go and i'm like right now I don't want to right now. It feels good to hate on this person or to be angry with this person is okay, I want to feel that way you know you know better, you know that the only person that's being damaged in the end is you, the longer you hold on to it no longer. Is it normal for you to go through those processes, it is. absolutely normal it is OK, I think it's as you go through this and you find your way through, it is, what are you learning from it like at the end of the day. If you say Ashley you cannot allow people this much control in your life or you cannot allow you cannot give too much of yourself, especially when a person is not necessarily deserving of it, you have to know your value and your worth. And that is just precious and you can't just give it away to anybody that comes along the way. and your family has to also know your value in your your worth and if they don't know it, you have to say hey listen I am valuable and i'm worth it, and and you're not going to just make me feel like this, all the time at your expense. to your pleasure you're not going to do that, to me, but you, you have to come to that place. And some of the things I remember when we first started meeting i'm like actually do you look like a dork I know you got some kids but come on man, you need go on a vacation. And the other thing that's reminding you that I have to take time for myself is to separate yourself from the people who weighs you down emotionally. You need to step away and you need to regroup because you eventually did go What was it Chicago or Florida."
2524.0,Patient,"I took off like quite a bit I went to Chicago and then I left and went to Florida right behind that that left right behind that went to Vegas so I like just I didn't go for a long, long time and then all of a sudden just boom boom boom I left and."
207.0,Provider,After that.
2524.0,Patient,"It helps tremendously, but the minute I. landed back in the runway got in the car and started realizing yep looking around me up i'm back here home yeah great and a lot of it is you know i've been in the same House for 10 years I desperately would love to just pack up and move and get away and start over and start fresh. i'm just because truthfully I I just along the lines you know i'll get to the point where it's like you know what no, I know I deserve better than this i'm now damn it i'm not putting up with this shit nomar i'm. Doing i'm not gonna do it i'm not answering the phone i'm not going to get stuff back in, and I do so good, and then I make it like. oh seven eight days and I cave every time and before you know what i'm in the car driving over there, or he's in the car coming over and it's just so ridiculous like i'm getting old I don't. want to keep doing this same chaos, but at the same time, no matter how bad I know the relationship is, for me, I still have all this hope. And it'll get better and what we just don't stay away from each other, so it has to mean something right because no matter what, if I one of us always is coming back."
207.0,Provider,"No matter what but but, at the end of the day it goes back to what I said earlier, as a woman. We love we love heart, because at the end of the day, we want to be loved we want to be valued, we want to be comparably want to. I want you to make me feel special I want you to make me feel like i'm the only one in the world, but what do what does it come with a price off. When you hurt me to hurt me deep and you hurt me deep in the things that you do, to me it affects me deeply simply because of how much I love you think about your children. As much as you love your children, you will give your life for your children when ungrateful can do something doesn't it hit you, deep down in your soul."
2524.0,Patient,"yeah that's exactly how it feels like. You know i'll say like well I think you're more narcissistic than you think you are because you say one thing your actions are completely different. And then. it's almost like you're making me feel like now i'm crazy and I know I mean I know i'm crazy but i'm not crazy about this situation, this is. black and white."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2524.0,Patient,"But at the same time there goes the. Two giving of me side of me up here just let me make everything all better I can't you know i'm strong enough, I can handle this okay just good and then, when I stop and think about it it's like. it's getting out of here really the only way i'm going to be able to do this because it's been six months of this crazy on and off. Situation and it's ironic, how it happens in the time frame that I had talked to the accident getting married. Everything kind of all at once, then I just i've been thinking about it i'm going to be 35 this year and i'm just like what am I really doing i've been married and divorced one time my kids are 16 and 17 they're about to graduate they're going to move from home."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm know what's gonna happen to you.
2524.0,Patient,"Two weeks, you know, two months when things were good we were talking about it in it was yeah well perfect time we can retire, I can work from home I don't have to stay traveling like this, I can take my job and go. let's just go and explore that's what we were going to do to just be two weeks after that. We can't even be in the same room as each other, because some stuff that happened on an off time came out and now, of course, I feel some type of way. And it just added on to all the more problems it really did and now it's just like."
207.0,Provider,You have a good relationship with your dad.
2524.0,Patient,No. No.
207.0,Provider,we're here that around.
2524.0,Patient,sporadically and then know.
207.0,Provider,growing up that's how he was.
2524.0,Patient,yeah it was yeah yeah he was he was that. He had horrible drug addictions.
207.0,Provider,"And, along with no I love you actually there was no embracing there was no no."
2524.0,Patient,"Not till I was way older from my biological dad way way. way in your life when you were younger than. My mom had gotten married to a man and was with go she's still with them and that's who I kind of referred to as my dad but. I was old enough when he came around to know that that wasn't my biological dad the damage from my biological dad had already been done, the years of abuse and and seeing the addiction and in and out of jail and just all of it that comes a lot with it, I had already. So it was just like I have this guy who's great and and I couldn't ask for a better dad but, at the end of the day, I still knew in my heart of hearts that my biological dad didn't want me couldn't deal with."
207.0,Provider,"The damage was already done in how you view and how you. So from the first guy in your life now growing up with your mom did you see your mom as someone who was just submissive or just even if she heard it in the relationship she just found a way to get through it, do you see some of yourself in in your mom."
2524.0,Patient,"My mom is the exact opposite she is a control freak she. doesn't allow I mean one one she can think she heard something in her put her thoughts in it, and the next thing you know her mind's made up that's exactly how it happened and and there's no change in her mind I mean Jesus Christ himself could come down and say. ma'am it didn't happen like that, and she know, yes, it did. right with it. till she's blue in the face, yes, it did show argue and debate and that's her mind is made up so she's a very one. turnover forgiveness, no you don't get a second chance, no, no second chance you get one time with her and that's it."
207.0,Provider,"And and is that how she was in her relationship, like you, viewing her even with your who you consider your dad Is that how she was with him in terms of was there any way to you did you see any. Their relationship, how did you view that."
2524.0,Patient,"um it was a good one, it really wasn't good one, they had rough spots. But they always seem to. kind of get through it make through um they separated after I was older they separated for a few years, and it was kind of like. You guys stop that really I mean. You guys are in two separate households all this crazy chaos. For what because you guys are still talking every day running around behind us kids backs going out to dinner, so that we didn't think they were still together and. All that stuff was going on, when in reality we all knew all of us kids were older at that point so. I mean they they did what they did for a while and things just kind of all fell back into place and now they're all back there back actually just moved back into our childhood home so it's kind of crazy being there going there, and like see."
207.0,Provider,What you just said how would your situation is different. From everything you just told.
2524.0,Patient,me oh God. yeah it's just. It really has like I just haven't been that good like bothers me it bothers me because i'm 35 and.
207.0,Provider,"you describe your relationship with this person you're with in the back and forth and doing everything you're doing he's a great guy and he's busy, but then then we're back to how is that any different from what you described with your mom and her husband. So, at the end of the day, the difference, it sounds to me that but they're also there's this other part of you. That you continue that I think this is what we talked about you're continuously seeking love and you're continuously seeking like I need you to love me I need you to reassure me all the time that i'm good enough for you you're continuously seeking that. But then, at the same time you fear the disappointment you fear the rejection nude fear the abandonment, because at the end of the day. you're still working through that abandonment and rejection and that lack of regard from your dad so you fear that piece like you're not going to do to me what my dad did, but I need you to love me I need you to value me I need you to fulfill this void within."
2524.0,Patient,"it's almost like it and i'm all right with the rejection of it, but just don't I can't take the back and forth in the in between, and the up in the air and. Okay it's really not official it's not official that we're back together so. What is it really that we're doing I we just. hanging out with friends that's all we really know."
207.0,Provider,"You say that you were Okay, with the rejection, but the truth of the matter, no one can be okay with rejection. Good so, so to say that i'm okay with erection or arm Okay, with the emotional abandonment and the confusion. Is no that's by no means is OK, but at the same time is having that conversation as to why do we keep doing this to each other. But and and both of you, having that chance and that opportunity to put it on the table, because then is it that he's confused. As to hey you're you're also guarding yourself like I don't know where I stand, or what because then, when you say certain things it's like you pushed me away. But then you're saying that but you both have to come to that place of having that conversation and saying we're getting too old for this. Where do we send and you saying like I want more out of this relationship, then what i'm tolerating right now. And, and knowing where does he stand with it because relationships, yes, we fight we love each other, we fight we love each other and sometimes you question. How much do you fight in comparison to how much you love each other that's determined by every couple right, so all of those things are not out of the norm. But you both need to put it on the table and say where, am I, where are we going forget about the kids for two seconds, where are we going, are we going to build into our future, or do we need to doesn't go our separate ways i'm not willing to give when you are not. i'm not willing to make these emotional sacrifices into a relationship as we should each other sure if you're not willing to do that, but you both have to come to that place. While you work on. The fear. Of the abandonment, or are you going to leave me like my dad did or my ex husband. Are you going to leave me, like all these people i've loved in my life are you going to do me the same way, they do, they did."
2524.0,Patient,"Nice, I feel like I already have it beamed everybody's gonna anyways. everybody's gonna place."
207.0,Provider,"And, but this is the truth. The more I think about it, my behavior tells everybody that you don't think that you're saying that to them, but your behavior tells everybody that. because all of the people that were so meaningful to you in your life have left even a friends have moved away, and even though you still talk to them in your eyes, you guys all next to me and i'm sitting here still trying to figure it out."
2524.0,Patient,"yeah when all I did is. tree everybody to good and then, yet my heart broken for the same it's just so. I don't know it's backwards, its backwards, because it seems like the ones that. don't care don't make a difference to them, they don't get hurt. it's the ones that. generally do care end up doing too much putting herself through too much them are always the ones to get her and no matter what I do, I can make myself be. cruel and heartless like these people are here Jesus Jenny some of these people I met when I started first was single and like oh you're out in the dating game again good word. I went out ran right back home to my ex husband my first husband like. That scary out here like whoo Okay, never mind like Okay, maybe my relationship wasn't that bad maybe we can deal with that because look at all the other chaos that's out here in the world and that's why I guess just goes back to maybe I just need to get out of here because."
207.0,Provider,"The person who still struggles, with the things that they're struggling with, even if you change locations geographical location you're still moving into a new location and that old person so following you if you don't work through that. So it's kind of the day. It is your father's for letting. me talk to him."
2524.0,Patient,"I kinda kinda just recently started talking to him, less than a year ago um. And he's at a point in his life, where he just wants to have a really good relationship with me and I can we were kind of doing all right, and then he blindside me took me out to dinner. and proceeded to tell me that the sister that I questioned him about 20 years ago and he screamed and yelled at me and told me, I was absolutely crazy and that woman, I don't know where she came from why she would say that blah blah blah."
207.0,Provider,"No, no, currently is my sister."
2524.0,Patient,"So this whole time I really have had a sister, and when I got when I was a little kid in school. I was like in the seventh or eighth grade these this girl came up to me and was like hey i'm your sister, and I was just like. me my sister my mom and dad are at home. It was not, you know, like so obviously I come home with questions blah blah blah blah long story short, no, it was all true hundred percent true he lived alive for all these years and. decided to come and it just really blindsided me the girl she doesn't want to meet me she doesn't want to have anything to do with him or anything of. That side of the family, which is fine Okay, but then why did you want to know you know why did you come out of the woodwork here you go 30 years later. The so weird her. Name her middle name is my first name i'm six months older than her."
207.0,Provider,and her name is Ashley.
2524.0,Patient,"He her name is Nicole Ashley, whatever their last name is and it's just like it's just weird to me it's really weird I don't know I don't know."
207.0,Provider,"It seems like, how do you name your other kid that you did all this time, the same initial order."
2524.0,Patient,"Right exactly like what's it, you know, and he does he's He suffers terrible for mental illness um. So yeah it's just it's just one of them situations with him that I, for my mental health, I have, I can have a relationship with them, but I have to have very strong boundaries with them because."
207.0,Provider,yeah there's.
2524.0,Patient,A lot of years of abuse there as a little kid she just.
207.0,Provider,"Oh, and you know I know what that tells me he has his own issues. That he needs to work out within themselves, but that feeling of rejection that you still carry around that feeling of abandonment that so you still carry around and the lies and everything. There is a part of you too there's there's parts of us that wants answers like, why did you do that, like help them to understand it doesn't change what you did it doesn't undo the damage that was done. But it's just like helped me to understand why you left me like I needed my dad. I needed my dad and why did you leave me why weren't you there for me why did you have any living, why did you have any believe in this life. And this is what how I sell food and maybe there's some point, this is coming to that place of having that conversation with him not to say that all he could say is i'm sorry. I truly am far that's all he could say whether or not you accept that apology and move on from there, but sometimes. it's hearing your parents perspective as to why they thought that this was the best decision for them, or why they did what they did. Even though it created damages, because at the end of the day, actually it's in the same way that your children may have feelings against you. That if they don't have that conversation that heart to heart with you, you will they will always hold this arm whether it's the anger or resentment or frustration. Instead of just saying hey mom you remember when you did this, why did you do that, and it giving you the opportunity to say. In at that time as a mother, I thought that this was the best decision it doesn't make it right, it just makes it, this is what I thought at that time, and for that I am truly sorry. It doesn't change anything it doesn't now say let's become best friends again, and let me just do everything for you and just acolyte in the past, never happen, but for you, it gives you some place of saying. Okay Now I know where he wants. So then, therefore, I not need to only have boundaries for him, but these are where I need to set boundaries for myself, even in my own relationships, where I don't allow people the opportunity to hurt me this way."
2524.0,Patient,"Now that's I I feel like I saw. Even when they hurt me it's like Oh well, I understand why they did it. And then I make excuses for it, and I can see their side people you know people every action they have is a response to something whether it's a way that they made somebody made them feel something they go through people don't just go around doing stuff because. there's no reason behind it there's always a reason explanation something even if it's wrong. I just wish I could just. make my mind up and. There we go, I just wish I could just make my mind up Okay, enough is enough if this is what it's going to be, then this is what it is and. Move along and be able to just accept it for what it is not have Oh, what did I do everything. That I possibly could have it's just I just I just that's the up in the air that back in the in the limbo. I made the expression, the other day somebody said how's it going to be honest, I don't know if i'm coming or going up or down left or right anymore, but it's. Just rolling through the motions and it's just like. i'm over it i'm over at I shouldn't This is all too much too much, and I just feel like. Just remove myself from the equation kind of thing just get away."
207.0,Provider,"You know and that's what you come out with again listen i'm if I come up and I punch when I give you a reason as to why I punched you Okay, I understand it. However, I still now know how to deal with you, I still not know that there's certain things to certain places i'm not going to go with you. Because hey this is how you react out of anger and frustration, or when things are not going your way, I still not understand the boundary I have to set with you. It doesn't change it on the sun what you're saying, but it doesn't change the past it doesn't change doesn't it it just gives me a better understanding of how I proceed now and it just makes me redefine and clarify. The boundaries that I need to set and that's ultimately what it is, and I think at some point in time, if you come to that place of even having. That conversation with your dad. And just trying to understand where his mindset is because, if he if he's strong he's struggling with alcohol abuse or what have you I am curious to know whether or not he maybe he was abused in his own arm, you know he's he was abused by whoever. Whoever whether his mom or dad or rejected or what have you, you know again no one aspires to be an addict of any sort we go through things in. A big shift and what we depend on only treat the symptom of the trauma or the pain and the hurt that we go through so he has to come back. But ultimately as it's related to your relationship and moving forward, a lot of what you described is where my it's pretty much mimics what your mom and your your your setbacks. You know how they live their life and you just do with a different the Foundation and the underlying theme is the same how you both executed is a little bit different okay. um let's quickly, so you are caught up with your drug screen. Okay, it doesn't seem that. i'm looking at. it's not saying that you need to do any."
2524.0,Patient,"I shouldn't I shouldn't have any surveys. there's there's three in my email and I go back through like every so often and just do them because I feel like it should be time to do, like the one quarterly wine and blah blah blah."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're good with that, then so let's. Make your appointment so in terms of reviewing your chart on everything seems to be good, let me look quickly at your. It seems like your your depression scale was a little bit elevated when you did it."
2524.0,Patient,"yeah cuz that's it was probably on a bad week and. off week like it's tough, I mean it's just like this constant roller coaster of. Self inflicted because i'm making the choice to do this, is that I know better. And then. Obviously you make bad decisions you're going to get bad consequences and you're going to feel bad about yourself, because you know better, and you just I guess don't. don't get it like I was trying to explain it to my best friend. it's like when a little kids little and they keep touching the hot stove and eventually they burn their fingers good enough, they don't touch the hot stove no more, no matter how many times mom's been screaming. don't touch the stove it's hot it's hot it's hot eventually they apparently they don't touch the stove in the markets damn hot they get it. And I feel like i've been burned 1000 times and I know that suckers hot but i'll be right over there, the first one grabbing up hot potato see how long I can stand it before I just can't do it. wrong with my brain I guess. You know, someone told me, the other day, the other day."
207.0,Provider,"They said, you know show me. That. This is how God has created you, you are kind hearted, you will go to the ends of the earth for people who are not naturally evil you're not naturally manipulative you're not up on this gets you back type of person, she was like you need to just accept that that's who you are. And I think that was the thing that I often find fault with like I don't want to be like that, because I keep getting hurt I need to be evil I need to me my nipple I need to do everything just a given so people can feel how I feel. But that that only lasts, as long as you keep talking once you start talking you go right back to who you are. And that was something that I fought with so it's coming to accept who you are you're doing weekly you, it is now learning so once I learned to stop fighting with myself, then I learned to say I need to be more. deserving of the people who keep hurting me and why do I keep giving them the handle or the opportunity to keep hurting me and the minute I noticed the people who keep hurting me I needed to limit my interaction with those people. And so that is what I would encourage you to do identify who is those people that repetitively keep doing what they're doing, and then, once you've come to that place, then you say hey i'm no longer going to allow you to do this. let's look at the. Fifth, you know what let's do the 17 1717. That 131 30 good for you or to."
