14187.0,Patient,hi how are you.
383.0,Provider,"i'm pretty good, how are you doing."
14187.0,Patient,i'm all right i'm doing okay it's been OK today. yeah support and all right. um. yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Well, I know you've been super busy with school, how is that going for you."
14187.0,Patient,"um well actually I talked. With my parents last night and i'm lucky they're very supportive of my decisions when it comes to school um and I was taking five classes and a lot of them are really heavy and a lot of work so. I talked with my parents and I think i'm going to drop two of them and take them in the winner because. it's just too much for me um this week, I was ridiculously stressed out, I was like. Like going to bed late and I had a really bad day this week, where I was just crying because I had so much to do and it's just like that, on top of working part time and I have like a few couple life part time jobs that I do. it's just too much, and I don't have time to do things for me. So I decided to just i'm going to drop two of my classes, so that I can focus on the other three. And i'm hoping that way i'll be less stressed out and. Be more in control of my classes in my work."
383.0,Provider,"That sounds very reasonable. yeah I know when you mentioned to me, you were taking five classes and what they were I was like oh."
14187.0,Patient,yeah it's.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, my."
14187.0,Patient,"was a little ambitious I you know I tried but it's just like. I it wasn't like I didn't think it was going to be stressful I knew it would be stressful and I knew I probably wouldn't be having a good time, but I was like well I might as well give it a shot and then, if not i'll just drop it so that's what I think i'm going to do. And then that way I can focus on myself a little more and getting better. that's what's important to me right now."
383.0,Provider,"Well, good I mean three classes, this is also nothing to sneeze that you know, meaning that it's still. considered like a full time load right."
14187.0,Patient,"Absolutely I it's um. yeah you know. I, I decided to. The two that i'm dropping our photoshop class and i'm an accounting class and the accounting class was just like I was doing like four or five hours of work, a day if, like. And that's if I wasn't falling behind which i'm falling behind because I a bunch of other classes and work, and so I was doing so much work for that class is very difficult and I probably could. I wasn't. Doing other classes and then my other class that i'm going to drop is the photoshop class which and. The teacher just stuck she just wasn't teaching very well and I wasn't learning and I was like I still want to take this class, but I guess we'll take it with a different Professor because i'm not learning anything and not being taught well. You know."
383.0,Provider,"Well, and so, what are the three classes that are left that you are keeping on here."
14187.0,Patient,"So the three classes left are my history class which is i'm so good amount of work it's. it's like a very interesting class and I like it it's a it's a space on like like American history it's like indigenous history and that sort of area and it's focused on minorities in America. very focused on like how minorities got here and how they kind of built. structure of America, which is very interesting but it's a big workload. So i'm. Doing that one, and then I have a Paleo anthropology class, this is fascinating because I love things like rocks don't like any sort of like historical fossil fossilized anything I find very interesting and enjoyable so and that one's a pretty easy class and. I like it so. And then, my last class is and a beginning oil painting class which. Art has always been like my like. Easy can do it. Like in my professors very like i'm a little behind in that class because of all the other stuff but I like spoken and I was like hey i'm a little behind on this this mess and he was just like email me. And just send it to me when you when you get a chance, so that was very like he. Because he's very like kind, and I do well in my art classes, so I don't have to worry too much about that, and I take art classes more because I want to enjoy them, not because I want to particularly go into an artistic field. Am I I don't know, but if I take me all the arts classes, that I take are for my own like advancement and just like just being able to excel more in art is what I want. For my own. So yeah Those are the three so the history, one is pretty heavy and. The other two, I can like handle fine, but it was just like with the accounting and the photoshop On top of that, and then like parts i'm working it was like I need to like drop some of these. And i'm very lucky that my my mom and my dad were very supportive of that."
383.0,Provider,that's Nice. How are you how are your. Jobs going and in terms of your anxiety and doing some of the responsibilities So how are you doing with your anxiety.
14187.0,Patient,"at work right now it's it's good, and I think it's because i'm one of the jobs, I do is I have like a million like little jobs, but then the two major ones for me right now are. Well, I work as a youth group advisor and director, so I. Have like at my synagogue that I went to preschool I went to use group they're growing up it's very relaxed it's very. reformed and I run the middle school portion of the Youth group and I run it with one of my friends who's also my coworker. And she does the high school portion. So it's. It is a little stressful because this year we added on. Like like usually we've had about 12 kids. Like that this year we have like 25. And gotten. yeah it's like just so and then I have like nine seventh graders and like half of them are like seventh grade boys that just want to like throw things at the wall and like go crazy so it's a little intense. And I do get a little overwhelmed sometimes, but my coworker Bailey she is a full time teacher as well, she teaches kindergarten. But she's very good at like if i'm like I don't know how to handle this particular situation she's very like oh like let's talk to them let's like do this, you can try this and she's. very supportive and it's a very comfortable environment for me because I grew up going there and I know everyone, and like a lot of the staff like i've been there way longer than they had like it's you know. it's a comfortable safe. Like I don't feel very anxious when i'm there."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm how. Many how often are you there.
14187.0,Patient,"i'm only there on Tuesdays for two hours it's like. In the evening from six to eight, oh no that's why because we just added office hours because because you got so many more kids and there's a bunch of our rabbi basically last year he just retired. So we got a new rabbi and a whole new set of Staff a whole bunch of new kids came in and everything's changing like it's like a complete rebrand of the synagogue so. there's so much more activities and stuff that my boss lori who has been very helpful for Bailey and I but she's pushing us to do, which is totally fine. But it is a bit stressful because it's. Like. So so where I was going with that was that we're going in at 4pm now and then doing office hours for two hours and then doing the youth group from six to eight, so I have to like add on that two hours which it isn't particularly hard work it's just like a lot. But I enjoy it and. I don't want to be there forever and People keep saying, like you, should be a teacher, you should do like teaching, you should I don't want a teaching job that's not me. And I love my kids at at work, and I was, like all the activities we do I love, seeing them grow and I want them to be able to have a safe space where they like. Certain milk or it sucks being in middle school and I remember how like awful everything was and I like mine and bailey's goal is to like have a safe space for these kids where they can learn about. Judaism, but they can also just like talk about like we problems and how much they don't like their teachers and all my mom's bugging me like it's really important to me that they have a safe space so, even though it stresses me out a little bit, it is a job that I enjoy. It I like doing it. I have really great kid so that helps to as well."
383.0,Provider,I bet that's that's kind of Nice to get out and just be with human beings and just connect with people after you've been studying.
14187.0,Patient,"Now absolutely and we were on zoom for a year, and that was just a headache so it's really nice to be like we're back in person, we do a lot of stuff outside now. But even then like i'm more than happy to just be like with people, and I remember, like the first day when we were back and I got to see all of my kids who would like grown a year older, since I last seen them, I was crazy. I do enjoy it yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Good so our last appointment, we talked about and. Unfortunately, our payment is kind of I know we've got a wait a while I thought was the shorter one i'm about your food choices and. edm that kind of thing and your exercise and. We kind of focused on that do you want to just maybe give me an update on how you're doing with your."
14187.0,Patient,"um it's not crazy better like it's not like. That well, so I did do one night, where I went out and I got a bunch of ingredients and my friend, Sam came over and we made a whole dinner of like roasted vegetables, I did the vegetables and then she grilled chicken. So we had chicken and like a bunch of like chopped up with like. Olive oil and like you know spices and whatever it was delicious it was really good. So I did do that, and it was it was wonderful and I loved it but it's just you know I haven't. really done much cooking other than that I I did have another friend over because i'm I was cat sitting for my boyfriend I had his apartment to myself, and so I was able to have like friends over and we made like. avocado toast for breakfast which is really good and I actually really liked it and I have like peanut butter banana toast for breakfast one morning so. it's not as frequent as i'd like i'd really like start getting in a habit of like. Being able to make my own meals again it was like with all my classes and constantly working I didn't have time, so now that i'm going to drop these two i'm hoping. i'll be able to change that."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well that's great that you had some experiences, or you just invited yourself to get some ingredients and and just keep in mind the nutritious. Quality of what it is you're putting in your mouth, you know just. Keeping that in mind how is that for you, when you just go shopping and and think about the nutritious value of what you're buying."
14187.0,Patient,"It good I mean well it's good when I buy nutritious stuff but. If I don't go to the grocery store and have like a preset like these are what i'm going to get I will absolutely get distracted them and go by, like a box of cookies or something I got you. I always do that, like every time I go to the grocery store I always wind up getting a bunch of snack because i'm like well i'm gonna be hungry later i'm going to want something savory to snack on. and address when I do that but, like when I did, like the roast vegetables that was great because I really enjoyed them and I enjoy eating them and I like felt good actors. are like even like having a snack of like the avocado toast that was like we had that like 4pm but like it was not to filling to ruin dinner, but it was like Nice and I didn't feel gross afterwards, which is a big thing for me like. I always wind up. Like i'll eat and then just feel bad about myself immediately. On. Definitely. i'd like to see change with that. But I know slight changes slow immediate. I don't know that's me make an excuse, but."
383.0,Provider,"Welcome and patterns are hard to change and usually. You know, to tackle it in small increments can be more helpful if you could even sort of try to tackle it like one meal like breakfast is you're always it's always going to be nutritious like we're just going to try to do that to you know. And that would be probably a really big a big thing if you were able to. just focus on one on one area. That I had been peripherally focusing on, it is good, you know now and then you're cooking that's better than not cooking at all, you know."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah and even when I I do. Like if I had to get food on the go, like the other day I like was in a rush to get to work, but I had I was I hadn't eaten and I went to like ralph's and I picked up like a Caesar chicken wrap i'll try. Instead of like getting something discussing on try to like us we're gonna have some chicken and lettuce and like. Caesar that that I know I like because the other problems with me not me like the problem was like my eating is that i'm a really picky eater and I have been since I was a kid. And I definitely like expanded my palate way more than like when I was a kid but for me it's like I just don't like a lot of things and i'm always willing to try something. Like oh i'm always willing to give something to try like if someone has something on their plate and they're like you want some oh absolutely try it. I just don't wind up liking, a lot of things which it's been hard, because then i'm like Oh, I want to make a meal, but then i'm eating the same thing over and over. And then, like like I don't like seafood i've never like try to see food that I enjoyed it. really made me see we'd like just dried. I can snack on that sometimes, but like I won't reach for it. But it's just difficult because. I feel like I. And my boyfriend gets annoyed with me he'll be like I really want to order this night you don't even like anything from there, so and i'm like well, you can order it i'll get something for myself. And that's you know, and I make him feel bad because he's like oh I can't eat anything like he's not upset with me he's just like no, we can order from there, because you can't get anything from there and i'm like. And like I always feel like. Because i'm picky I lean towards the safe snack that I know i'm gonna like that I know that are going to fill me up. Rather than maybe leaning towards something healthier."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah. yeah well, maybe trying to. You know, do taste tests or. continued to expand your palate you know, like. I made some a fruit salad at a friend's house and then I was like oh gosh fruit salad that's right, I really liked fruit salad and came home, and you know made one at home. Just X continuing to explore, I think you know if it's potatoes mashed potatoes and gravy and one Sunday afternoon, you make your own mashed potatoes. And maybe just my yeah just so we just continue to just try, you know and be somewhat. But I understand how that kind of complicates things."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah it is you know, and I always wind up liking, the sugary things and the things that are all artificial. And I talked about with the last super late like there were a lot of things as a kid I wasn't allowed to have because they are unhealthy and I understand there's no like. I don't like reason my parents for that, like I i'm happy, they did that because, like now I don't really like sodas because I never really had him as a kid they just not like I won't REACH, for one, but like with snacks and stuff that I know I do like like she agreed chips and I like. Like right before bed i'm like I i'm hungry like this is a small, to see like a little bag of chips and i'll be fine and then it turns into three and then i'm like. Why did I do that i'm so upset with myself and it just like is this constant cycle of like getting really angry and upset with myself because i'm. Like in these cycles. Being vital and healthy and not treating my body good."
383.0,Provider,yeah how are you doing with exercise.
14187.0,Patient,"i'm. Just not real I I went out I took my my cat my boyfriend and I cat she we're trying to get her to socialize more and be more comfortable with the outdoors because she loves being out on the balcony but, obviously. makes us nervous when she got on the balcony so I take her for walks and I did. A few days ago, I took her out and that was kind of my my exercise, which is no lot. But it was something and I got out and I got to walk around and just be out in the fresh air, it was when it was really windy and I wanted to take her out because I thought she would enjoy the smells and everything and she did. And it was sweet um, but that was. A small thing that I did that definitely. My step, I feel like. Right."
383.0,Provider,"Well, what do you feel like you would like to to. challenge yourself to do, and this this domain of your body. Also, I just was wondering how is your body image, how are you feeling in your body."
14187.0,Patient,"Oh, I I hate my body, I like I don't like using that word, but like I I really struggled with self image. I was really young I don't. i'm not confident. I don't I wear a lot of baggy clothes. I wear a lot of baggy clothes and stuff because I don't I don't like showing my legs arms and legs and. I don't like my parents I don't really like like my face and I I struggle, a lot with them. and It sucks like I don't like being in Florida I don't like. I used to be okay, with my body, you should be able to wear clothes and feel comfortable but i've recently like awesome comfortable in our life. Like sweat through leggings and like a big sweat shirt which I like i'm not ashamed of that i'm not ashamed of like liking sweatshirts that's kind of like my thing, though, of wearing like baggy clothes, but it's like that. that's it like I can't I just really don't like because the way. My body bucks and i'll feel fine. At some point, like i'll be like oh. Today i'm Okay, and then someone will take a picture and i'll look at it and i'm like holy shit like that not like. i'm like i'm huge I don't I need to lose weight, I need to. I get really mad at myself frustrated because I just don't. I don't like being in pictures and. I want to take pictures with like my boyfriend and, like my friends, but I always straight down because I I take away what it's been like that for years and years and years since I was like hey like 12 or 11 ever since like I hit the stage in like i'm. Like what's called. You ready when I puberty so. Ever since I hit puberty when I was like 12 ish that was and I started like. Seeing myself, I was like oh I don't I don't want this, and I feel like it's funny because I have like this idealized version of like."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I was just gonna say what kind of what kind of image, do you have where you where you actually feel like and you can be honest and say, well, if I look like that I wouldn't be I wouldn't feel this way."
14187.0,Patient,"Well there's a lot of things, one is like when I was like. You know, up until I was about 17 I was pretty thin I was like punching 1500 20 pounds. And then. When I hit 18 I started gaining like a ton of weight in a short amount of time. And I didn't understand why, and I knew it had to do with my eating habits my exercise and my doctor said it might be partially because of my thyroid and. I whatever combination, it was it was like. An even even when I was a lot smaller I thought it was genuinely believe because that I was really sad and I like no looking back at it like infuriates me that I think that about being so small, but. there's that and then like I have like really deep something is that, like very self conscious about is like when I look at them it's just i've got these huge circle and like I don't like my smile and awake my arms i'm really self conscious about. This just like a million a million things. don't thank me myself, I, like my personality and like. I, like you know think capable of my interest in that way of saying i'm content with but, like my physical self i'm very self conscious about, which is why I want to start eating better exercising. Sorry."
383.0,Provider,"No that's okay i'm glad you know we got to this because. I really, really think that it needs to be addressed with you know, for you. yeah I think it's sort of. Maybe more of a central. issue, even then, you know anxiety and depression, I mean I know it's intertwined but i'm. Just also wondering if you would be well suited into our eating disorder program because. You know the way that you're describing that it's not that the eating disorder is I mean we haven't talked about the benching and the purging if you're doing that now, but. The level to which you are not you don't feel good in your body, and you know the criticism that you have of your body how how much that is you know prevalent. it's. You know, you should my hope for you would be that you wouldn't be walking through your life like this right now."
14187.0,Patient,"that's what I want right it's like when i'm when i'm in with a group of my friends, I can think it's like i'm the biggest person here and. I know I shouldn't I do because, because when I hear my friends talk about that it makes me so sad because I love them and I don't care about their size and I don't care about their weight, but if. I know I shouldn't care, but it's so. Deep rooted because I thought this way, since I was a kid and. It sucks because I just. Like I can't I can't stop eating, but then that makes me feel worse that adds to the problem and."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I think that I think that i'm going to mean with your approval i'd like to put in a request that. My supervisor, maybe consider. Transfer bring you into the eating disorder program and working with a therapist that's really going to address these things it's more you know, the more specialized I mean I have my own approach but. You might get farther faster in this in this eating disorder Program. Are you doing the binge eating from time to time."
14187.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,Are you purging.
14187.0,Patient,"Not as much I do once in a while, maybe, lastly, maybe. But. Not as much, ladies."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. um. One thing I just like to say is that. Even if you did something when you were very young, you know when you were young, and this is the pattern that is evolved over time. It doesn't mean that you can't change. You know today, now that you're an adult and that you can shift your approach to your your body. And I think that. You know you have these internalized sort of images of what it is to be. Acceptable in your body to yourself. And those internalized images are very impacted by these ideals right the idealized versions of. Pretty beautiful girl looks like."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah like my my boyfriend who I love and adore his his best friend her name is Ali, who I also she's so sweet and I love her, and I look at her and i'm so jealous because she's so tiny and she's beautiful and. it's just like like I always see her and she's a total we are like I want what she has not, I know that sounds so bad, but it's true, and you know I look at other people, a lot of my best friends or just pray me and then they've got like beautiful features. So not that being bigger is not beautiful a lot of my best friends are bigger and so am I and. Every size is beautiful beautiful but just for me. It just in my own body in it just feel ugly it. Is struggle with that or."
383.0,Provider,i'm glad that you're you know talking about it and acknowledging acknowledging what's real free her. In there The other thing. Right.
14187.0,Patient,Now I have a dog.
383.0,Provider,"That you know I lived in southern California there several times and. it's a very we're even if you have nothing to do with the beauty culture down what's your ever your job isn't related to it for you don't do not part of the movie or TV industry, there is a way that that culture permeates literally, like everything and."
14187.0,Patient,It really.
383.0,Provider,It does. I am. yeah so.
14187.0,Patient,it's what i'm sorry.
383.0,Provider,I don't know.
14187.0,Patient,"Like my my boys went to an event for my his friend alley the girl, and she."
383.0,Provider,has a job.
14187.0,Patient,Like journalism and writing about the magazines and stuff about celebrities and she had an event and my boyfriend. was helping her and Ali later was like showing me like pictures and. Video but it's all these like beautiful models that are. Totally done and i'm like. I don't know why my boyfriend for me like I don't. And it's hard I know that's not real I know they probably have a million issues of their own. It.
383.0,Provider,"yeah because it's it's really. takes us away from what's actually is real. And, and so you kind of really lose perspective, and when you lose perspective and you don't have it you're not you're you're not. in touch with reality, then your thoughts are really distorted and. it's just a conundrum."
14187.0,Patient,"Like it's like I don't even know like what my reality is I look at. It, though, who I, what I want to look like I literally just don't feel happy like no way I. don't feel confident I used to be a really confident kid I can just walk up to people, and you know it used to be really outgoing and then just started all changing and especially when when I was 16 was when I started developing really bad anxiety and. The first really bad incident, I had I was working at like a clothing store and it was on third street promenade where it's like a lot of people. And I started at one point I almost passed out at work and, like got light headed and lost my vision and I just like to drop to the ground, it was so humiliating and. And then, it just kept getting worse and it's gotten so much better because i've been in therapy and meds you know it's really. gotten like i'd say like 70 80% under control, but it's it's just like other things just flare up and I get like really self conscious and anxious and. You know it's. i'm constantly comparing myself to other people."
383.0,Provider,"Right right so that is right there is something that. You want to start to dress when you notice yourself doing. it's like. Everyone has, I mean the thing about Los Angeles, though, is that because everybody I don't know what I mean it just is a magnet for really attractive people I just. Either pop out they show it they're like. Oh, my God like. Everybody all your. You are totally beautiful aura you. You know I mean it's gorgeous. And the thing is is you, the important thing is that you don't feel it now you don't you don't feel a bit you you've you physically like I mean those are such little minor things which you said about your you know your eyes, are you mean. and And it's just. that's the that's the difficulty about being in Los Angeles, is that it's easy to compare because you've got a lot of beautiful people around. You there's a way that you can just be like you know okay i'm in a really. Like let's say if we used a metaphor. You know you happen to be in like a garden of like really amazing like orchids you know, and I just think there's just it's just like a huge garden and there's all these different kinds of orchids all these different kinds of people. That are very, very beautiful but you but they're unique right and so like with an orchid you look at it and you're like wow this is so unique it's so unusual you know and kind of. Special in its own way, and then you go and look at another orchid and you're like wow you're really gorgeous in your own way and so that's how I would like you to start to maybe think of if you wanted to go tissue I was, I was that you want to go tissue."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah my yeah. Okay, thank you, oh you're back I would summer right here."
383.0,Provider,"So. If we just address the fact that you compare your this comparative thinking loop that you go into. Now it's going to be impossible for you to not see the beautiful person that you notice. If you can look at them and think of them as an absolutely unique individual. and acknowledge the beauty, for being like a unique market. And, and then that's it not compare that to you now compare that person and their beauty to you. But they have their own just like. Just like plants and it's you know you like you taking this archaeology class with the specials the science, you know, there are those, like every rock or different species has their like special name, you know they're like. The."
14187.0,Patient,The track. And like that yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah if you can start to try to think of think in these ways so that. You know jogs your attention that it, this is not a comparison you know you're not comparing. Like like things like everybody is unique and you are unique."
14187.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"And you don't want to. If you want to lose weight if you want to have you know your body, a certain way. you're you can go after that you can choose that, but that is going to be unique to you not so you can be a cookie cutter of. You know what's pretty and Los Angeles and 2021."
14187.0,Patient,"it's hard not. Like being around like my friends and like having them think like oh she's she's gained a lot of weight, since I last saw her like I I know how people think and i'm not like. That like if someone gave away of Christian notice and. And that just makes me feel bad like I don't want people thinking of me like that. Just make it at me and be like well she's just not doing well, I know i'm not doing well, the best thing and cleared. It just been stressed and busy and. Very self conscious about things so when people play out. It really hard."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. This The thing is, is you have. In some ways that we all have bought into a belief system about what beauty is and what and what factors are big or heavy or wait is that it is. That is somehow a liability, but it is somehow a deficiency, it is somehow. You know all Stephen like a moral defect."

14187.0,Patient,"yeah I can try it, it has a lot of a lot to do with like being tired and like mentally tired i'm always mentally tired. Which spent discouraged me from doing anything. Really mentally poof it's just like. I do like one I did do that it was like 10 minutes a day and. I would do it and i'd feel better. After a while the first couple times stunk but like when I was doing it consistently it definitely. was a bit better so. I always just feel discouraged, because I feel mentally exhausted.

14187.0,Patient,"No it's okay as. I know it's not. And then I wind up putting into a pen try to be at 830 it's. All backwards, because all my classes or later like impersonal and rallies later my word is late, and then I always stay up two months later, and so like I usually have breakfast or noon, because I just i'm not usually hungry is i'm up earlier."

383.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, you can talk yourself back into it, if you can talk yourself out of it. I think that you know if you go to bed super late it's where you're sort of against the circadian rhythm that's happening on the planet of when you're it's dark we sleep them and it's late wake up. In so. So. let's have you work on seeing people as their own individual orchids I don't know if that image works for you or he. And and see if you can detach from comparison and if you do want to. Start connecting with your body with exercise. yeah."
