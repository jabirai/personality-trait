8600.0,Patient,"No, I actually was going to. send an email to the the man that was like in charge of the search committee because he I don't know if I told you or not, but. I interviewed with two teachers first, then I went to the the education board of the school and interviewed with them and they were the ones that said, like we want you to come up with a presentation and present it to the whole committee to the whole. Like the board for just school, so I did that, and the third interview, I presented it and so he sent me back the message saying that everything look really well and. That. He wanted a copy of the presentation and three references though i've sent him those last Thursday."

8600.0,Patient,"Okay, I just wrote that down what we discussed right now, so I can come up with a little short to send it two or three sentences um we like. my daughter was sick, but just for a couple of days, she kind of bounce back from that flu shot. My son has been sick all week it really, really got it, I mean he never in bed, but he's been infected all week he'll just come out with something to. drink or eat and then go right back in because he's trying to not get us sick so it's been kind of funny everybody's been in their little rooms, this week, but.

383.0,Provider,yeah I. Did did he get the COPA test.
8600.0,Patient,"um he he got most of the shots, so this is more like. A runny nose and a headache and it's not like a fever or anything like that he's just. So we didn't think it was related because he hasn't like I said he hasn't been out of the House he's very cautious, you know as far as the mask and he's very cautious about interacting with people. were just thinking, maybe it's the flu."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
8600.0,Patient,"yeah. I made him yesterday soup and so he is feeling better he's been eating like oranges and Soups and I think last night he finally ate. Like a. Oh gosh this Arabic bread, with some meat in the middle, he was able to eat one of those and so. yeah but we're doing."

383.0,Provider,But you always have that I think that it's not so so bad because you're close to the ocean you're always close to the ocean so you're going to get marine you know coolness.
8600.0,Patient,"yeah we are we're like close to the area called. beaches, maybe about 10 minutes but we're in North part, but we can just hit the highway and go to beaches. And mission valley and all that it's this area that my son and daughter chose chosen really nice area that really active. And so, she really likes it and yeah she got some really good news yesterday, so we were all kind of hyped up let's and I."
383.0,Provider,yeah what was her news.
8600.0,Patient,"she's working on a big project for her herbalife and her manager left so she just got she's been working on this project for a while, but then she got a new manager creative. What do they call it creative designer or something and, and so the lady the lady is kind of like really high strung and my daughter's very low key so she she says yeah here we'd like your work, and this, and this, and this and didn't so. let's see today's Friday Wednesday they had a meeting with another manager turned it all around this is not going to fly you got to do it all over again and it's due Friday. So she just like really dug in I was really proud of her, she didn't panic and she just dug it Wednesday so she submitted it Thursday morning. And the new manager said nope, this is not what i'm looking forward, this is not it so she gave her some feedback. And then my daughter turned it around and send it back last night, and they were both like yeah this is fantastic, this is what we're looking for and so she's just really, really, you know excited and happy. And when they're happy i'm happy Hello."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah you guys are such a close family but.
8600.0,Patient,"yeah so she's and zach zach he's really, really under the weather poor fellow. Hopefully you'll shake that this week."
383.0,Provider,"well. just want to review some of the goals that we had identified and back in November. We talked about you. Just feeling free to express your thoughts in group and feelings and crew and seems like you are doing that, and you kind of met that goal."
8600.0,Patient,"You know, I know, like last Thursday I kind of. I got emotional, but I just you know I just hate when people cry and, especially, I don't even know her name when she started crying I was. Like no don't cry don't cry. But yeah I just hate it when people are get upset like that and cry and you know."
383.0,Provider,Why do you think that. That bothers you. Why do you think that that that affects is.
8600.0,Patient,"It my daughter asked me that you know because I I she's like what happened and I told her I said oh one young lady was upset I I just think like the mother figure in me comes out, and I know she's so young and and yeah I just feel like. That group is just awesome and when somebody's hurting I just feel it just really touches me, you know, and I just hated that she was you know crying and. any of them, and I see such a big change and so many of the Members. I think his name is James he has like long blonde hair. yeah like he's like night and day from the beginning, his facial expressions are all he's really light and and. And mark mark also he really boosted me last Thursday made me feel really good and. But I think also. You know, we were brought up like you don't really talk about positive things. About negative things, but you know it's kind of like if you talk about like oh I got a new car and. it's kind of like you're bragging when you know, and so, and it wasn't bragging it was just like things are finally turning around for me and I was just excited and. I felt bad sharing but and that that's why it bothered me, I think I. I looked at her, and I was just like oh my gosh That was my daughter sitting there you know upset I would really be upset you know but yeah I think it just a mother, the mother instincts came out and. I just I felt really sad for her."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad you're challenging yourself to. share your your good things in group. You know your positives your wins and and not feeling badly about it, although I sense you're somewhat still feeling badly about it, but I I, I want to encourage you to feel you know people like to hear good news."
8600.0,Patient,"yeah that's what when mark said that you know that made me feel good that made me feel like yeah it's okay to share this, you know that was a real good boost that he gave me. But yeah I. think that was all really just be her like they're hurting yeah."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well. You know. it's challenging to be in the presence of people that are are are. very sad. yeah and. You know. We can understand how they can be sad. Without. Without us sort of being triggered to be sad also but that's like a process of. You know that that's something that I think that doesn't happen overnight, you know. yeah. Is it bringing up some sadness, for you just to kind of talk about it."
8600.0,Patient,"We should just seems like a new person. really, really. It really bothered me."
383.0,Provider,You know yeah. Nice very sad to see you know such a lovely people you know going through so much going through suffering.
8600.0,Patient,"I don't see how you do it. How many years, have you been doing this."
383.0,Provider,i've been doing this for a long time over 20 years. Working in mental health.
8600.0,Patient,We work primarily with adults or do you are you mixing the children and also.
383.0,Provider,"I work now mainly with adults, I have worked with children before but. My i'm better and I prefer working with adults. yeah. And that's what I sort of started with so I kind of started with adults in my internship and then I had a little stint of working with young people for four years, I worked in residential treatment. In southern California actually outside of Los Angeles."
8600.0,Patient,So that that was tough.
383.0,Provider,"yeah it was tough, it is probably the toughest population, I think, and so I really I related to what you were going through when you were saying you're working with kids you know, with special needs, not an easy not easy job at all."
8600.0,Patient,"yeah that was some. I don't know like even though my son was doing the same thing. It just really bothers me. You know, like. Especially like when they're non verbal and you know can't express honored feeling what they want and and then they pin up this anger ages was really tough, for me, I don't think I could go that kind of a field stay there. they've called me from here, and since. emails and text messages to join the team here, but I just don't think I want to do that anymore."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
8600.0,Patient,You know just stick to my uber. But yeah I am.
383.0,Provider,Less emotionally draining.
8600.0,Patient,"yeah my son my son says it is really. is really tough, you know."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah so let's see so we had you were going to highlight your accomplishments in preparation for your job interview it looks like you were pretty successful with that.
8600.0,Patient,"yeah they one of the guys that was on the board interviewing me. He had actually lived in Abu Dhabi and taught at the University of Hawaii. So he knew all about other Dhabi and Dubai and. The area that I was last in Medina desired he knew all about that, so he kind of like pounded some questions in there, you know that quite a few regarding the the Ministry of Education and how I handle conflict resolution with. The American teachers to emirati teachers and. The the Arabic impact studies, teachers, so he was asking me about those kind of things that that's a really difficult group of women to work with."
383.0,Provider,So the school that you you've applied for that a public school.
8600.0,Patient,No it's private it's probably they have a K to five in one building and then. More towards mission valley there's another school that goes from six to 12. So what the way that I understand it is they want to bring on somebody to work with the teachers to get away from. paper and pencil and do more hands on activities and with the high schoolers they want somebody to come in and work with science teachers science and math teachers to basically do the same thing um and yeah I science is my background so. You know when they saw that they were kind of excited too. But. that's kind of what i've been doing for the last 10 years I just go in and. kind of assess watch the teachers what they're doing and. Then we work together to set up programs within.
383.0,Provider,"So you're kind of coaching the teachers, then."
8600.0,Patient,"yeah yeah kind of like a coach yeah. So the only thing I had to be really, really careful is. The teachers are really young everyone that i'm I see I kind of just kind of. went over there, a little early and I. Just kind of get a feel for the place and. The teachers are young and out of like you know, maybe out of college one or two years but um there's a few of them that are. error Arab and there's a few of them that are Pakistani and you know you had to be careful not to step on their toes you know because. Even though they're trained in Jordan and are trained in Pakistan and and now they're here working it's. You know they're they're very sensitive when you tell them that what why don't you try this."
383.0,Provider,First right right so.
8600.0,Patient,"that's what I ran into a lot in the UAE the. When the American teams came on board. They were just adamant to prove to us that they knew what they were doing, and so it was called a lot of conflict between the American teachers in Arabic dishes because there were two in each classroom one American war era and. You know, Mr it that's their country, you know and they're just very, very prideful and very sensitive when you correct them. haha so I learned a lot over there with conflict management and how to talk to people and stuff so."
383.0,Provider,So is this a. A school that is specifically it's a specialty type of school or is this like a Muslim.
8600.0,Patient,"it's primarily it's an Islamic school. But. it's a democrat demographics are American Afro American Sudanese I saw some yes Sudanese students and a lot of Pakistani students so they're kind of making a blend and. The school is doing really well, I mean it's. it's it's doing really well it's progressing and so now they're up through the 12th grade, and that was their objective. I said now they got to solidify it, you know they yeah, we have to upgrade and we had to upgrade curriculum but it's. Mostly, you know paper pencil and book. Right, so you know it was just like no these kids should be doing, you know science experiments participating in science fairs and math math. So. They seemed like they liked what they heard and. I mean it wouldn't it's not going to be an easy job for anybody."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
8600.0,Patient,As you're always going to have these 12 people looking over your shoulder.
383.0,Provider,Right right that sounds kind of like a heart that sounds like a tough job. I mean do are they paying you pretty well.
8600.0,Patient,"I thought Steve we haven't got to that point yet, but. does what my daughter and son and I were talking about, and so I was looking well my daughter kind of. She was looking online also like okay if you're going to go in, as an administrator are you going to go in as a curriculum designer so they pay pretty well down here, and so they were like you know you can't back down and you gotta stand up and. So I think with both of them behind me. they're just mad, I can tell you there was just like Julian me and, like you, gotta say this and you got to do this and you gotta you know, stand up for yourself mom. because all of the board, I only met one female teacher and that was the very first interview, it was a male and a female and. After that it's. it's been all men and a lot of them are. and professors at. San diego's SDS you San Diego state i'm in some of them are doctors and so they're pretty group of highly educated men. You know I just have to be careful. not to let them overrun me."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, yes."
8600.0,Patient,"You know and that's that's what both my son and daughter were saying you know you just got to be careful with that and stand your ground and. But I think that's why they wanted to see the like they asked me a bunch of questions, and so I had to answer those questions in the PowerPoint and I was trying to condense the PowerPoint but it ended up. Being like close to 13 slides so I answered the questions and then that's that's when they started asking me what what are you going to do. If you come on board, and so, then I I put that on a couple of slides, and then they started asking specifics, you know how are you going to change the math program How would you change the science programming um. So. I think I explained everything pretty good and they wanted to see a five year plan and so i've made those before."
383.0,Provider,My goodness you've done a lot of work already for the for them.
8600.0,Patient,"yeah that's what my daughter was saying, she says what if they just snatch your prison."
383.0,Provider,I know my goodness.
8600.0,Patient,So he.
383.0,Provider,said he wanted a copy of your presentation I don't know if I would have given that actually honestly I just being frankly.
8600.0,Patient,"But I think you know, the thing is, is that you can have that presentation, but if you don't know how to implement it that's that's the problem. them that piece I just gave them like I answered your questions and the steps that I would take, but I didn't put the third PC i've done this so many times that I actually have an existing presentation, but the third piece of that is how we're going to do it. Right. I didn't give them that piece I just. that's a lot of work. And when I was in Atlanta. I was part of it startup part of school dare and. That Charter school is just doing phenomenal now, but I was on the science and and I did the science piece for the classrooms and the environment will be. I really enjoyed that, but the. whole environment was toxic because they had. You know, like the board members for the school had their wives working there and the wife one wife had a sister was there as the principal. She was qualified she was out of Houston, but I just it was a blend of mash of Okay, are you talking as a board member, are you talking as a parent or are you just talking, you know so um I stayed there for five years before I went overseas and and yeah it was not fun."
383.0,Provider,"vicki I just want to just review just to. Just to not to interrupt you i'm sorry to do that, I just want to cover here if you. So i'm so you know i'm i'm so delighted that you are really honoring your accomplishments and all of the experience you had you know when you get to your age. You should really you know hold that experience that you've had as gold, it is you know you've had a lot of experience and you don't you're not just. Fresh off the you know so that you're worth it you're worth a lot, you know so that's something to keep in mind for yourself, you know when you are going into these negotiations. You come with a lot of experience and there's not there's there you're you're not a diamond doesn't I mean there's there's a lot of there's not many people at all with your background so they're not going to find another person really like you so hold hold to your worth. For sure your your your rarity so. and So the other couple goals that we had with the two would you know continue with your daily walks and getting outside getting sunshine. Now you're doing that."
8600.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not as frequently as I like. I, but I am outside all day with uber. You know, running around with them and but. So, like the walks is just kind of when I come home and, like my daughter was like let's go for a walk and we'll go outside go for a walk together so she's everybody's just being kind of, the fact is that Mary was busy, and so i've been kind of just doing one block by myself. it's not like in arcadia where I would get to go through the whole marsh and stuff but."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
8600.0,Patient,But i'm outside so that that does feel good being outside and being in the sunshine and stuff.
383.0,Provider,"yeah good um and then yeah just I think we talked about you like making a list of your accomplishments but just you know I think you're you're doing that, as you're. applying for these jobs you're kind of highlighting your accomplishments and keeping those in mind just in reference to you know. Your health and everything right now make sure you use a gargle and salt water, you know. that's an old fashioned remedy that is very adopted recommended to me if you start feeling any thing in your throat gargling salt water like three times a day it's one of those old remedies that is supposed to be really still really good. salt water. And yeah just keep yourself healthy and you may want to get that coven test I don't know I know it's kind of intimidating or scary or whatever, but just to know you know exactly what it is that is going on."
8600.0,Patient,"You know, we did the two shots."
383.0,Provider,"Right, but even if you do the shots you can still contract contract the virus, so you just won't it won't be as. dangerous because you've had you've been vaccinated but you, you still do want to maybe get get tested, so you know, so you then you don't maybe you don't work for a while, because if you do have that you don't want to you know be risking of spreading it around."
8600.0,Patient,"You know, you know, like all the people that I deliver like mostly i'm delivering groceries, but there is. Maybe one out of 10 will actually answer the door, and even if they answered the door they'll tell you okay just put it right there they don't there's really the people around here there's like no interaction, you know. yeah they're all like I also do this. Through walmart it's called point pickup and they're also the people yesterday was the first time, all week that this lady actually came out because she had ordered a bunch of water packets, and she helped me to carry them in but the people are not even coming out. yeah. So that's kind of a relief, but yeah the salt water, the the other day, as somebody else mentioned the salt water swishes and yeah."
383.0,Provider,gargling yeah.
8600.0,Patient,"yeah, but I think like with my son staying in his room he's very serious, you know not to get us sick, so he just like I say comes out and goes right back here."
383.0,Provider,"yeah but if he even you know because it's airborne and hippies in the House, you know, and if he's not wearing a mask of it's like you know it's very easy when people are in the same home to that's the most. always been very careful, so I would recommend you guys get the test, just so you know 100% you know get the. Get tested, because you can still have the virus, even though you've gotten the. The the the vaccine. And then that way you wouldn't want to pass it to anyone."
8600.0,Patient,"Yes, so true is is. Do we have the light if we get tested well they know immediately, or will they know."
383.0,Provider,"I think there's you know there's different grades of tests and some of the tests are more accurate and it takes a little while longer to get the results back and then some are less accurate and then you get the results right away. I would always go with the one that's the most accurate, even if it takes 24 hours to get the test back."
8600.0,Patient,"Do that all the CVs and walgreens at all of them are doing the test around this and giving flu shots also. I didn't even want to get the flu shot, because my daughter got it and she was just a little stick crew like two days and I just don't want to get thick that, though."
383.0,Provider,yeah did you get the booster for for coven the coveted booster yeah.
8600.0,Patient,"No, not yet I matter of fact, I just got the they sent a text message saying, can you can come in now and get it. Aha yeah no I haven't done that but there's a lot of places beside the pharmacies, I mean they've got like stations, set up in the parking lot and stuff around here or. or shots if there's a coven shots and flu shots and stuff, but I just didn't do the flu shot."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
8600.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I think dressing your health is probably the very first thing and making sure that you know that you get that. Get tested and then get your booster and you know, be very protective of yourself and also others, you know, during this. period yeah okay."

I took my trip to Oregon and Washington and now i'm just going to be home for the holidays so nothing, nothing too special but i'm looking forward to kind of relaxing and cooking a few traditional meals."
8600.0,Patient,"Oh wow yeah yeah we're just we're just going to be here, where we might my drive out to La. See zach's fiance but. So far as it looks like we're just going to be around here."

8600.0,Patient,"my daughter she wants to drive up to San Francisco next week, the week and the week after Christmas yeah the last week of the month, she just wants to look around and see. apartments and stuff because she's thinking about shifting there, but so we might just drive up, I have no idea I just go along, for the ride they're like my mom. Though yeah."
383.0,Provider,I think yeah good well. it's nice to see you.
8600.0,Patient,and say.
383.0,Provider,I was there anything else you want to talk about or to review.
8600.0,Patient,"No, I think i'm. I think i'm doing good I just. You know, like central she changed the medicine, but she put it like two little ones into one main main tablet."
383.0,Provider,I see.
8600.0,Patient,"So that's working fine and. I. I guess that's that's about it, I just. The anxieties of it, I just can't explain it sometimes i'll just be. Like outside or driving and. Like sometimes my thoughts just start you don't want too much just flow into here to here to here to here. literally just. Sit out and and just like try to talk myself through it like what what's going on, why are you feeling like this. yeah I haven't had trouble sleeping or anything like that there was a couple of days. I wake up, really, really super early and can't go back to sleep. But yeah I think everything is moving along and I just. i'm. Just."
383.0,Provider,"Telling a transition, you know so when we move to new places and. And you're you know there's still going to be some. Some anxiety might that might bubble up you know related to just change, you know change in general and then. Sometimes change makes you think about you know. anxious about the future, you know about what what other changes. But I think if you ground yourself in the present moment. Excuse me that's always i'm also asleep. Will sleep deprived but. you're grounding yourself in the present moment and the here and now, and the the sunshine, you know where you are right now in. Connecting to where you are right now whether that and that's why you know going on walks and being in our doors in the you know, seeing the trees of your area or just sitting in the sunshine. doing the breathing helps us to ground into where we are today, you know. And to bring your thoughts to the present."
8600.0,Patient,"Okay, and yeah cuz that's sometimes I catch myself drifting back the things that have happened and I. And i'll catch myself and i'll tell myself like no no that's that's long gone that's That was a long time ago, that was a year ago and we're here right now we're gonna we're doing this and yeah I really try to catch myself when it's. When I start to do that."
383.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes also, though, if you do need to get something off your chest or talk or process about something that happened in the past, then journaling is a great way to do that. And just do you have a journal, that you can write in."
8600.0,Patient,"I I had. a head start at one when we first started, but now what i'm doing I do is after we finish, I just have this and it's two sections one is for group and then one is for when you and I talk. is divided up and I just kind of like you know put what we talked about put some notes in there, like that."
383.0,Provider,"I see good you might want to use that from time to time they save you write about 20 minutes a day but it's really, really. healthy thing to do in terms of. Getting out what we might be ruminating on so you don't have to do necessarily 20 minutes a day but doing some writing so that you process some of what is perhaps you're processing, you know some things from your past. And then, if you. want to bring it into therapy and talk about it a time to do that."
8600.0,Patient,"Okay, all right that's maybe i'll just buy a little booklet a little note. There to carry with me okay. yeah okay i'm just walking i'm just kind of looking around and seeing what's out there and. I don't really put any thoughts in there, what i'm doing. Okay. yeah I think yeah."
