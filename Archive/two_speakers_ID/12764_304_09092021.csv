304.0,Provider,"yeah just to get the right dosage. yeah you know you'll start to see effect and benefit after two weeks, but then. You know, you might need to go up you might need to go down, so I would really say that would be like your next step. yeah yeah get that reevaluation do you have a primary care doctor."

For me, sometimes I feel like it's a better thing, but it is very stressful and it can be, I have to handle it a certain type of way. For it to be very beneficial or for me to maintain it for a long time, I guess, I could say, because I can do a whole bunch of times i'm throughout the year it's actually getting it and keeping it and you know being having it for five years.
