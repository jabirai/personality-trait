15669.0,Patient,"pretty much yes. sounds good, what does it say it's always. it's always good to have help i'm glad to have my brother around and then my mom and stuff like that we kind of divide the kids up so. Like i'll watch my daughter or watch my youngest one or something so it helps to have like at least a couple or more adults inside the House to kind of always they're not too bad, but I mean still kind of you know, keep track or you know, whatever."
148.0,Provider,"Of course, of course. yeah so it doesn't feel too overwhelming. Right yeah. that's good Okay, and what they like to do what kinds of things do they like to do with you."
15669.0,Patient,"um let me see here see her well all three of them what I like to watch like from Michael Jackson videos and that kind of thing they can all participate with me that doing dancing interacting. And then my daughter is most familiar like when I read a book she'll say Oh, what are we reading energy like see the name or see him, you should like Michael Jackson or someone's actual concert athlete. So, like her, and my five year old are both into constantly asking like mommy, what are we doing that goes on Teller and then mettler mommy, what are we dealing until repeat it so yeah they're very. Both on the same level talkative at that point, and then my my youngest my three year old he'll get excited when. i'm watching music videos on my phone or my iPad and step to like get so excited i'm watching something on YouTube on the TV he'll get so excited or something like that car, just like just like watch it. So, yes, we tend to spend her on a little a long time we're just kind of you know, doing whatever."
148.0,Provider,"yeah so you, you find ways to be really interactive with them, which is so good yeah that's great how. Are you i'm good Okay, and then how how how's everything else, then just that. With medication."
15669.0,Patient,"Pretty pretty good I talked with some can't think of. But you know the nurse practitioner yesterday to kind of tell her that I didn't realize my brother picks up my medicine from out of town and so he told me that. It wasn't in capsules I mean she thinks that I have to call them make sure the pharmacy everything's good to go on file. But how it came back and tablets and I normally take capsules I let her know that i'm like if you could make that just. goes Okay, I had done that so yesterday and I asked her, she goes okay i'll send that in and I got a coupon from bright heart saying okay to take care of the. The before it instead since it'd be another pick up the same prescription, but another prescription of it and stuff like that, so I got that taken care of the way I would be running out on vacation and stuff."
148.0,Provider,"But um because she actually had mentioned after you left yesterday, she forgot to tell you that she did put it in but that she thought you would have to pay out of pocket. yeah you got you were able to get that cup covered from bright heart, then."
15669.0,Patient,"yeah they sent like a little gift certificate, or like a little coupon thing and so. I was like oh it's How much is it know me i'm like I think, is it the coupon was good for like 38 or something I go 99 she's like okay it's not so much too much, but still, we have never had that were suddenly the mental health place I go to takes care of the be. You know, but nobody uses always taking care of the insurance, but didn't know the prescription of it, except it it'll work out."
148.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you got that figured out good. Good um and I know that the last time we had an individual session together, you had just recently miss a day of taking medication so we're feeling a little off from that have you been able to take it steadily and since consistently since then."
15669.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, there was like a couple times I think a couple days last week is due to. different circumstances and I was like I can survive, one day, the next day it kind of starts throwing throwing me off, because I mean again it just really helps me get by day to day on build a concentrated just kind of get through, make sure nothing. kind of goes bad mentally for me where I can build a still do what I need to get done and that kind of thing So yes, it's very, very important interpreter knows that too and stuff so been pretty consistent."
148.0,Provider,But i'm glad to hear that because I hear that it does make a huge difference for you and you are taking your medication.
15669.0,Patient,"It is and it's helped a lot a lot where things are studying our I can get stuff done and build like I base different mental or different. Different mental mind moments during the day and i've like it's much easier to take care of when I of course it it's. The once I take the medication it's good like the next 24 hours after and said the consistency something just hoping to keep concentrating and be able to do what I want to do, and not having anything being the way or block."
148.0,Provider,"Right that's what word was just coming up for me, would you call these mental block for you, when they come up like what does that look. Like for you. you're out your day what would a mental block look like, for you."
15669.0,Patient,"And then to block would be like basically. let's see I told him like basically when i'm dealing with is the opposite of good it's you know I cannot talk about it, you know he he be I you know so. Anyway, so it's that particular thing just going after whatever I am like say, for instance, I went out to eat or whatever like well a good example I went to say starbucks last night. And usually i'll go to certain places and stuff i'll make it about a week later, so i'll go there. One time during say on a Monday at the next week i'll go there, that following Monday or Tuesday i'll go there once is okay. So I went there last night and stuff and some the middle the morning and I was like thinking. Okay, you should you know, this morning I was awake and I had taken care of my younger son and stuff because, if we accept them want to drink and that stinks I stayed awake I was reading my book and. my mind can just thinking like oh I shouldn't maybe have that drink i'm I was having trouble concentrating like. I mean normally i'm doing just fine, but I think it was too early, the morning to be maybe green such material or whatever like I should be fine i'm awake you know. Certain times certain things and kind of make a little wind like extra like spike your extra like. Just until it kind of recuperates and moves on, so things like that oh go after like maybe put that off for another week or two before you go back there, and maybe have that particular drink it was like a. Hot and hot apple juice drink so, and you know God for things like that I have to set like timeframe of okay i've had ice cream, maybe a week or so later, you can have it again that that's how I can recover and move on to that thing again so yeah."
148.0,Provider,"So a lot of the mental blocks around. Food, would you say."
15669.0,Patient,"It can be food or sometimes um let me see here getting into certain areas of my like I like to do, cleaning and my kitchen which i'm being becoming better at before I should just maybe do sweeping or some kind of like where we're. able to do more things mobile so before I wouldn't go in my garage is a npr garbage or anything like that or mess with anything in the garage or sometimes touch my counters in my kitchen because it'd be like a mental problem, sometimes like removing. If there'd be items on the counter removing it and basically trying to move from one. Day to counter to somewhere else in the kitchen or moving in general, sometimes moving around such things and such areas. It would cause a mental situation, later on, for me, like my mind would start kind of going after me like going after. Things trying to make things a bad in a way, and once they're bad if I can't take care of it right away, then it's done with you know which have been better. So anyway so sometimes when I touch certain things go about certain areas like like Roger go clean my kitchen i'm i'm like okay your minds kind of acting up. You know they didn't you're messing with this you're doing this, so maybe don't necessarily do that well put that off me for a day or kind of. Put that aside, or something like that so certain things like that that kind of irritated agitated little bit and then like I can still move on, but it collects me know this is why your mind is kind of acting up rather than the conscious steady flow of how we do things."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so I hear that, while these these mental blocks are still challenging right there and enjoyable for you, because you know how to work through them."
15669.0,Patient,"Yes, I know how to like get through it and stuff like that build a put it aside and move on don't let it get. To holy to the item the product or whatever, and like like okay I can't do that thing again, you know I can easily put it off like okay i'll put that off for another week or. You know I can do that sometime later or something like that, but not totally like destroy it, where it's like I can't do that thing again, you know so i'm able to kind of manage it for better."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good good yeah because what I hear is, if you weren't able to manage that and work through it or take step back when you need to fix that, but that would throw you off completely from. Doing to do things like either throughout the day or go back to do that thing again, it would. Just but you're functioning really well data days when I hear."
15669.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, yes, which is a good thing, and so forth i'm i've had better moments I think ever since I kind of I told you, I think. Such or two ago that, since I had my long break during this summer, and I put off my what I love most my you know watch Michael Jackson is videos reading material. That put that off or a good like March, April May, June like four or five months or something like that, so it was really hard to kind of get through like a height, so can go to this but, like mentally my mind would think. it's good to go it's gonna go crazy, you know so, then I put that off into cut occupied myself to get through that time. And now, things are more manageable and more better and i'm able to kind of bypass certain things my mind tries to attack something mentally trying to make it bad for me. i'm like all kind of just like be able to get by and put it aside and stuff like that, whereas if it gets too much, I think I told you when I was walking my youngest son to preschool and stuff like that, like, I was taking him in a wagon. And so during the walk when I would take them, there are certain areas like I kind of I don't have to think about it, but. I know how like kind of go about like maybe kind of stick on the sidewalk or go round things because again mentally going through certain. Parts of the say walkway or whatever what bothered me so basically when I was coming back and just like my mind was just having to. Like going after mentally after the wagon itself and i'll try to put aside put aside and i'm like. And I go all the way home and, finally, I just I had to give up you're like okay fine I just can't use it anymore it's gonna bother me so once I get to that point I have to get it new do something else. Bigger another way around it, where i'm not going to deal with that get around that problem so yeah."
148.0,Provider,"But you're still finding ways around and that's. Key yes, yes."
15669.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah because if you were to just."
148.0,Provider,"avoid completely and then leave the House because right, that would be manageable but."
15669.0,Patient,Right right right.
148.0,Provider,ways to work around these these mental blocks.
15669.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, and come easy like I can just move on to like Okay, I need something new, I can't have that anymore i'm doing better about not having to go through see things like clothes or food items or something like that, because that's my way of. Just moving on and not feel like once it's turned mentally like bad for me don't even try using that my mind's going to keep activating like that's gonna bother me so."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good really good work. And, and how are you feeling with the holidays coming."
15669.0,Patient,"up with Chris pretty good pretty good i'm actually doing better, I was very quite happy with myself. i'm like I went Christmas shopping like this year, and last year and stuff because i'm seeing, like all summer. I suddenly had sustained from like taking a shower going out, it was just my bathroom was bothering me, and it was a whole mental situation so i'm on a better path now. So I was able, quite happy with myself, I was able to wrap the present, so the I got my kids, and so what that sounds very quite happy with that and I had no problems at all like. normally have problems like either like certain items like I have to buy more than just one item say like tape or wrapping paper, so I got. consecutive or enough amounts of, say, the wrapping paper tape the name the name tape cards and stuff like that to make sure if I could use that first one, I had a second one. So I did, that I was able to do it pretty much with ease and I was very much happy. Except for I put them around my tree thinking Okay, they hopefully should be fine because normally I have things play saying in the garage I can't have things certain things made within view or within i'm close to me like a good example. Let me see here. Like certain things i'd rather just put it away and not have it near me otherwise my mind might if it sees it for too long and might go after it mentally and I can think so anyway, so I had my. wrapping paper or no I normally would have things to do it in my garage my um let me see here so like the gifts and. toys and certain other things just put away and it's easier i'll bring it out when i'm ready. So I, so I thought okay I don't want to put it back in the garage I want to put it underneath the trees, so I did, and then my my second my middle child my five year old those. This they're both my daughter, and my favorite books in the Christmas spirit, like oh so we kind of you know, started kind of wrap them like no like. No, no, no, no don't do that don't like i'm not really happy nothing again so he grabbed one of my. youngest kid gets i'm like okay that's gonna be left out i'm not doing with that thing again so started terrorists are more gifts i'm like i'll just maybe bring them back up so i'm like like I was quite happy with myself, you know that I did that, and so, yes."
148.0,Provider,that's huge that's really wow yeah what an accomplishment.
15669.0,Patient,"that's so. Much real happy with my brother was doing everything for me last year he's like you know Oh, my goodness tried it this whole rapping thing. My mom taught me well i'm like I knew her weight on like what's the Lord got it so he had to do it another room when I was like oh my I don't think I could do this. So i'm like oh my oh yeah so I was quite happy, I was able to do that, this year, so."
148.0,Provider,Beautiful to see so much progress and just one year.
15669.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah so very, very."
148.0,Provider,"And you feel good about it, we feel."
15669.0,Patient,"Yes, I do or yes i'm just like oh good i'm like things are going good runs like not having I can go about certain things to do certain things and not like come in mind, have a problem with it i'm just like okay with that yeah."
148.0,Provider,Good okay. Really amazing work i'm so impressed. Right is there anything else that you wanted to talk about today.
15669.0,Patient,"um let me see your was kind of part, yes, shows thinking about even to mention it, but, like some of the examples that we went over how. What was it like not coming to the thinking process, I like to think positively and then like the outcome, and then the ND would be positive versus if you did negative or whatever. or thinking things have to be done a certain way, it was always kind of throw in like how it related to me, but I want to share that with everybody else and i'll just say how when things have to be done for me like they have to be in a certain way, like when picking up something. Whether it be like picking up a toy an item in the living room things have to be like a certain. Like if it's not mentally the right to me, it has to be done, where I can build it how the person do it, you know the word like have that. thing taken care of done or object completed or whatever the things for me mentally yes, I do, how to get things done, that certain way, and then. There was something else or somebody thought of oh yes um but then also thinking like can you or do you ever think how. Maybe kind of think what the other person's thinking or someone in a way, like or wonder like why they're going to be staring at me that way, or what are they. Thinking yes so i'm just like I can kind of partially related my mom my mom will be that way she'll be like she'll raise questions at me like okay. You know, like i'm be anybody like my my husband's family like aren't they thinking this don't they talk about this day and i'm like I have no idea but i'm not even wondering if you'd. Like to other yes So yes, I can lead to other i'm like that doesn't apply to me, though, because I don't quite you know wonder like that and stuff so."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good so you're not worried about what other people are thinking you're just."
15669.0,Patient,"No, no."
148.0,Provider,"doing things that that work for you and the way. You can calm your own mind with doing things certain ways. What you're focused on which is really, really great yeah. Yes, a lot of times we it's common for us to think about oh what what could this person be thinking and take that so that stress that you know nothing we can do about what somebody else thinks right."
15669.0,Patient,"yeah no no and i'm like I don't think that way, I mean yeah. yeah I love to talk so we go over the different topics it surprises me, as I said, the first one, we talked about it was kind of familiar a little bit, but. If it interests me more and basically brought my attention and to know more about we're talking about the later on, like I don't even go out that way but it's interesting to hear about you know the topics you bring up and stuff and how that goes about so."
148.0,Provider,"yeah good yeah, thank you for sharing that with me i've noticed you've been a little bit more quiet and in group. I feel like the last couple weeks so yeah thanks for letting me know what's coming up for you, I like to hear I like to hear what comes up, and you know it's okay it's okay if there's a topic and you're like I can't relate all to this because that's going to happen right."
15669.0,Patient,But it's interesting it's interesting I really enjoy like how Felix and. And what's her name and stuff like that how they share based on like those are really good examples are really like that and support that so i'm just like mentally i'm like I had something to share but i'm like I don't quite want to you know. reveal that or something rather do that personally.
