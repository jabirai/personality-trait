462.0,Provider,How are you. Okay. what's been going on with you how's everything going over the past. weeks.
10230.0,Patient,And nothing major happen. anyway. It kind of just been like. going through life. today's actual weekend where. I don't have anything to come across some actually caught up something to try to do some some incentives for that. I have that done eventually receive.
462.0,Provider,A.
10230.0,Patient,sentence that i've been driving. So. that's good haven't gotten no I did get a little bit fine with my own car.
462.0,Provider,"So you've been kind of. literally and figuratively cruising along. You nothing's been super activating for you you've been driving, which is a big step, have you been driving to work or."
10230.0,Patient,"Any driving to work and driving to drop off my school I. contention it's kind of a lot of things I kind of want to try. head to like places that I personally didn't report just to kind of get. comfortable with ideas but driving, but I find it okay when i'm with someone, but if i'm by myself, I kind of I start to freak out a little bit."
462.0,Provider,"yeah So this has been an anxiety provoking thing for you, the driving but you're pushing through it, so you notice that when you have someone there to support you and just kind of be by your side it's a little bit easier. Well, no that's not surprising, it can be. really helpful to have someone. What you said you want to kind of focus on going to places you want and need to go, maybe you could have someone go with you. Just to do kind of like test drives to places that are maybe I don't know a. Little further a little bit of a scarier more hectic drive."
10230.0,Patient,"I want to try to do that well so. They want to do it because they are scared of my driving might come up and say that pod is driver but. I think the only thing getting on my nerves. I like. My brothers comments about my training. it's kind of like. annoying when the person that you have around everywhere, he said. I only response in like because I want to end it and I don't want to argue with me get a license and get a client and tell me stuff you can you can tell me no."
462.0,Provider,Fair response.
10230.0,Patient,I mean new permit thing like three times and then a license want to tell me about my driving oh.
462.0,Provider,Absolutely it's fair for you to be upset by that are bothered or annoyed because you're doing him a favor by driving him and then he's criticizing you but. sounds like you're handling it well by just kind of sticking up for yourself and letting him know the reality of the situation.
10230.0,Patient,Okay.
462.0,Provider,"All right, so you're working on the driving and. How has worked been going."
10230.0,Patient,"Well it's been good it's been a lot of changes because he's not an advisor. All of us. All of us. This episode about work. So I mainly work at the bookstore and that has like the cafeteria and the market that is run by look at the book yesterday on the weekend and nothing has happened at the bookstore but, at the flea market she is kind of a lot of things that we my pad in place for ideas like that. And it's. frustrated the vendors. Especially because. She had been like one two is talking to workers don't talk to the people that never actually came outside she didn't have anyone else shouldn't talk to the vendors and feel free to come out because she knows at the moment that she comes out of London y'all. Know like attacker well not. At some of them, but mostly. yeah I mean it hasn't really affected me because I do sit down and give information and then like queen for it doesn't affect me necessarily to that on the card, but. it's kind of sad to see when people come up especially like grandparents who like you know are just able to like carry stuff. You know another it like the cadence thing that kind of frustrates me and. Then there are some conversations about like. US being laid off at the bookstore which honestly I thought I wouldn't mind it, but most of my paycheck comes from the free market, I really don't care all that much if I just because I know at the flea markets going to do the job that I continued with because they need the bookstore. So I guess i've dealt with that a little bit better than what I would have back to back like you like. It when I was younger I would have like been reaching out that we had a new supervisor initiating other changes, and it would have been hard to like get accustomed to it because I like having like a set routine and things like that."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah it sounds like some you know classic work place stress, where people are upset and you're kind of upset and seeing what's going on, but you coped with it and are kind of."
10230.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,So was there any point where you felt like it causes anxiety and you were ruminating a lot on it.
10230.0,Patient,"Well, when someone when one of my co workers mentioned that. My penance right so that's like I had to realize that we have like another supervisor below her. She doesn't want to get the vaccine The next thing so she would honestly get fired. When they told me about that I kind of got worried. Because. she's kind of the one. protects us from the people and the fact that, like take care take care of like stocking and technology and stuff like that they kind of pay all the workers. The student workers because they think that we don't do anything but take in mind that there's seven of us or six of us working at the same time there's only three registers work and they do this boxing. So, and the main supervisor doesn't want to cut our hours, so I kind of just stuck there, doing nothing, and so they complain about so. The moment that my supervisor lead is like they were just want to fire us or they were one of our hours that's what got me worried, a little bit, but then. I started thinking, I was like well, I really like I care about the bookstore job but it's not necessarily, something that would be like oh I lost it because. It will give me Tuesday and Thursday off, and I will be ready to home homework, so I just found like a positive outcome. You know laid off, so that was better than I would do."
462.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely good work that's some really good mental processing that you did on your own and. something you had been talking about was feeling like you were just scraping by as far as school goes like you were just getting things done, the day before the day of, and so it sounds like this might give you a little bit more of an opportunity to work on school. How has that been, by the way, have you caught up."
10230.0,Patient,"yeah I caught up and actually. only have a presentation and a reply to the discussion do today, and then I have Saturday and Sunday to kind of work on anything for next week, but let's see some kind of like. i've already set up by two three days so it's a lot better than I was before, before I was like really trying to rush like five minutes before the best line let's get it done."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's good i'm glad to hear that you know it can be really tough to adjust to working and school. Especially because you hadn't been working with for so you do you've done a really good job coping with all of this and making it all work still succeeding in school, and then you said this weekend is kind of your first weekend in a while, where you could you don't have any obligations."
10230.0,Patient,"That yeah we're. headed into for life afterwards I would be rushing back home from work and, like trying to get the assignments done so I wouldn't really have time to like. Just like sit down and so I kind of have time for that, like right now i'm going to drop off my phone, the first time that i've had a nap in a while. I thought I really thought about counseling you know, right now, I have to go."
462.0,Provider,"you're good for you i'm glad you got an APP that's so important, especially, as you know, a young student it's just you've got a lot going on, so you have some free time this weekend, what are you going to do with it."
10230.0,Patient,"i'm i'm thinking. Some of biology for next week, just because biology takes too much time and it's like so complicated. And then I have my own books and I need to finish, they have an essay for it on to do that, but Besides that, I can not going to start a chef on any of my two other classes. And I might go out might go to something I don't know i'm kind of like not the cultural type of person I kind of have to force myself it kind of depends on like the day like if I feel like my social media time and i'll go out negotiated hello, I just stay at home."
462.0,Provider,"that's good it's actually since you are a little bit more introverted a really good thing to do is to just see how you feel and listen to how you're feeling and decide based on that so. The good news is that you do have the time, maybe you try to incorporate a little bit of extra self care a little bit of extra rest great to get ahead on some of the biology stuff. And then. A little social time wouldn't hurt either, so you can kind of check in with yourself, maybe practice, some of the coping skills do some deep breathing maybe a little journaling and then see how you feel and decide if you want to rest relax watch a movie enjoy yourself at home. or hang out. Have you been I remember one thing we were talking about was maybe trying to be a little bit more social, with some of your co workers how has that been going."
10230.0,Patient,"Well, I feel like the fair market people it's kind of a little bit harder to do. For them to open up with me just because they've been working together for so long that kind of like oh it's like a new person. that's intended as a coach I talked to them, I did not talk, but that's pretty much it, there is one of them that, like she's a psych major. thing that I realized this site manager who that we just talked a lot of trauma like it's nothing and everyone but. kind of like or it's something that happens to everyone. And everyone just looks at me like when I tell my boys like they're just going in the. world and. She kept. She knows what i'm passing it great so that you have someone that you feel connected to. yeah and then at the bookstore I have two girls and I really became close to and I, you know you become close on the side talking about their boy problem."
462.0,Provider,Exactly.
10230.0,Patient,"Just like. I don't think that I would make any fun, but."
462.0,Provider,"This is progress soon big part of what we've been talking about is just kind of you growing into being a kind of a full blown adult and gaining independence, because you have had a lot of. rules and regulations that you've been following in your House that are pretty strict so you're starting to gain independence through work you're starting to formulate friendships based on who you. Who you enjoy like you're like this psych major gets it that's awesome right so you're starting to drive yourself you're you know getting closer and closer to. Completing the credits that you need in school you're coping with your anxiety and depression. You know hugely better than when you first came into the program and I can see that, because your surveys have gone from up here to. have more down here so there's. A you know noticeable change and you describe that change so overall know things are going pretty well and there's been a lot of improvements, what would you say if anything is kind of your biggest barriers or or struggles right now."
10230.0,Patient,um. I. got me in a sense that. I.
462.0,Provider,Remembering.
10230.0,Patient,"things from the past, of how life is effectively and then you know it's not good to kind of bring like trauma back. Because it's like. You think of it in a different."
462.0,Provider,way like.
10230.0,Patient,"shows that kind of thing that I do is I do sometimes. getting into arguments with people and then realizing that they're not differently than me not wanting to set them off in another problem. Right that's one of the major issues besides that I feel like it all kind of just depends on like. All right, i'll just focus on like my dependence and like."
462.0,Provider,"And that's been a big theme of what we've been talking about. So it's something you can still continue to just reflect on right reflect on what independence looks like for you what your path to independence looks like timeframe right. If we discussed it can't necessarily happen this very second because your students so you're gaining it through school that'll be a huge. Part of it so just continue to reflect on that notion of independence, what it looks like what you want your future to look like and how you can build it because the more you think about it and imagine it happening that's when it starts to come together so. That can be something to think about and then just trying to do the things that make you independent driving. keeping up at work, even if there's tough stuff going on right, making sure you keep your work going and engage in that and that gets you out of the House as well, I know that there's really tough communications and kind of some toxic. relations within your House, which can be really hard so. just maybe reflect on how to distance yourself from that in the future, and then how to cope with it in the present."
10230.0,Patient,"time, but I feel like a moment. A little bit like when. This is going to be such a drastic change, you know, like. Definitely um I do have some freedom now, but from having like a. Personal mental freedom, where I don't have to worry oh my actions, going to be careful with this person and the benefits. Are as me wanting to simply go to the store is going to affect my mom because she wants to like you know feel like she like that I depend on her or. You know, can I do things on my own, without it, affecting my parents or, can I just completely lost and not look back and it won't affect the things like that I felt like. on it, but I do kind of cut off that connection, on my plummet down a little I thought it was just take a bit of time to kind of get to it but yeah."
462.0,Provider,"very realistic outlook on it it's going to be a change change is hard change takes adapting and coping. So there's no doubt that there might be a bit of a dip down and that you'll struggle, a little bit for a while, but the good news is is that you know if you remain in therapy you'll have support you can create a writer, we can create a plan. Maybe do weekly sessions, if you needed at that time to just. kind of get through that versus before, when you really had no support no skills, no mental health. discussions going on. So yeah while it will it could be challenging and I think that it's good that you're aware of that. You have a lot more, you have the whole toolbox now of how to handle difficult life circumstances and support, so you can just keep reminding yourself that yes, that's realistic because it's a huge change and also i've got this."
10230.0,Patient,"Without therapy without for their lives they are without some of the things that I went through so like I would never be taking asleep I said, I would just be too scared to always do, because of the. Light repercussion that I would say, so that they would face so that's another thing most kind of like well. We can younger now and it's. good to know."
462.0,Provider,"That is such a powerful statement right, you can see that you're evolving emotionally as a person and starting to make choices based on what's going to benefit, you and your life of course you're not trying to intentionally harm anyone else but. Those choices are what's. going to formulate a life of. You know more happiness and joy versus being stuck in trauma cycles and. Toxic communications. So that right there, you should write that down what you said. look back at it, when you need a reminder of why you're doing card things. So. Right now you're cruising along you have an idea that in the future, there might be some some challenges, when the big changes come. Is there anything else that's on your mind today or that you wanted to process through."
10230.0,Patient,"No, not really so that's a pretty good feeling like i'm just catch up on is like we've been. kind of. rushing through life and. Besides that, I feel like because i've been so busy I haven't been included, like focused on the badass like this life offended that you're done, you know it's annoying."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's not a bad place to be so keep working on your school this weekend, fortunately, you have a little extra time so that can maybe. allow you to have the rest that you need. We have an appointment on. One T ic 10am. Okay. Okay well good work like I said, you made a really powerful statement there about how you're really starting to make changes and the younger Donnelly would be just continuing to remain in that kind of cycle and you're breaking through it so keep keep doing that keep doing that. yeah alright smelly well if there's nothing else, then I will see you at our next appointment."
10230.0,Patient,Thank you.
462.0,Provider,"Alright, have a good weekend enjoy your rest. Take care. Could you please use a direct quote of what the patient said about how without therapy and all that she would have just probably stayed home or whatever I think that's a really nice quote and. yeah that's about it, thank you."
