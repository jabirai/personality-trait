191.0,Provider,"right but and I understand what you're saying, but my concern is with the risk deformity can that in pinch, some of the nerves, because I know some. People who have normal risk. That have really bad carpal tunnel. And that impacts, the median nerve but. A lot of my carpal tunnel patients, even though they have this pain, the pain goes up because the whole arm adjust to accommodate and i'm wondering if you transferring. The how you've had to adjust and use this in a very different way anatomically probably from the way the arm is made, so this is a normal anatomy and you say this is abnormal did that then cause pain to go upward okay that's the concern, do you have a primary care provider."
16577.0,Patient,"of no I just I talked to the insurance company, the other day, and they just told me I just pick any I can just pick a doctor go, I mean. yeah. So, open up. Your."
191.0,Provider,"primary care provider, so let me share this with you, Michelle so we'll work together on this and i'll talk with your primary care doctor, this is what I want you to do. If you have a congenital deformity and you've had to adjust all this time, we really need to get X rays of the risks, because if this is paying that we can't fix through normal ways of dealing with pain. Then we need to have this documented because risked hands and arms are just a part of what you have to use for the rest of your life. So, if this becomes an issue of."
16577.0,Patient,disability.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, and it's evident in the X rays you'll have. will be able to get you, the more support that you will need long term, you said i'm saying oh yeah so I if i'm going to see you for chronic pain and I don't have a problem with seeing you for chronic pain, but this is what we have to do. In addition to taking care of the pain, I understand this primary. But we have to deal with the problem so something congenital, we need to brace the risk the arms. Get you to a hand specialist and work with you, because then that can affect all your nerves and everything that we need to work as a team to move you forward okay."
16577.0,Patient,Can I just go straight to a hand specialist.
191.0,Provider,"Well, what you need to do is go through a primary care. Okay, and i'ma tell you why. Because a lot of times the hand specialists will say I will do this but I need your primary care doctor to do that, you need somebody you need. A point person that's going to say Okay, I need you to get to the hand specialists okay Now you can start with a hand specialist, but a lot of times they like to get the background. X rays and stuff that's done so once you see him he a lot of the leg work has been done Okay, and then let's say if you start he does a physical exam which i'm not able to do on the video. They get what. They may be able to do nerve conduction studies and if if we start seeing that wait. There is something bigger than what we think and you've been adjusting and dealing with this for such a long time, but it's good to get some objective thoughts on this too okay."
