759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"The 15th and so you know that has a. You know it's just food for thought, you know thinking about those precious moments, and then realizing that a person, a predator like this sees you and and that's what that's what they gravitate toward. gravitate toward a person that's like a wounded bird you know what that big a wound in me for somebody who's looking for that that's like a beacon, you know. uh huh yeah so yeah I got this book it's called."
759.0,Provider,scenting target how and why the narcissist Jesus yeah.
15667.0,Patient,"yeah it's a couple of more that this guy he is a he's an author, but he's also a Narcissus slash psychopath. Okay, and so he's giving you the. The real deal from. Their perspective. And he talks about narcissism as a protection and it's a. yeah it's like a you know, like we have the automatic response. Whenever there's danger present our whatever that system is goes into it doesn't stop and think it just."
759.0,Provider,Does.
15667.0,Patient,"And that's how he kind of labeled the that narcissism or that in PD. The. The borderline personality. Not borderline but narcissistic. Whatever however you say it in in PA. or whatever you don't say it right yeah. About yeah. yeah so it's you know what it's just really. nice to know, and you know something that i've noticed, too, is that i'm doubting. What happened. The reality that's one of the symptoms of, and you know what I wanted to ask you. yeah if if there's a test for for complex. Complex post traumatic stress if there's a test that we could do, or something."
759.0,Provider,"Okay well you definitely have trauma he knows and complex trauma, you know I don't think necessarily, we need to do a test that's just a reality, because of what you went through. So I think that's one of your diagnosis here, let me. double check. Okay hold on."
15667.0,Patient,"yeah what is my diagnosis, by the way. This moment okay Take your time take your time."
759.0,Provider,"Right now, they have you for. Let me double checked another system real quick."
15667.0,Patient,And can I ask you about how the groups are going.
759.0,Provider,"How the groups are going, are you doing good."
15667.0,Patient,I want to be so bad.
759.0,Provider,you're you don't have a good to go to.
15667.0,Patient,nope.
759.0,Provider,Let me double check that for you.
15667.0,Patient,Okay okay.
759.0,Provider,Maybe you're not coming up because he have. His last names.
15667.0,Patient,yeah i'm probably under Oliver and some of the systems. Okay blake is a newer name.
759.0,Provider,But yes and your name. yeah I see you now yeah all over. yeah we have people for post traumatic stress disorder. Oh yeah.
15667.0,Patient,Post traumatic.
759.0,Provider,yeah post traumatic stress disorder. PS PS. PS TD yeah.
15667.0,Patient,OK cool so what's the difference between that and complex over that.
759.0,Provider,"wall complex I don't think there's a DSM term for that I think complex trauma it's just necessarily saying that as complex is not one straight, you know traumatic event is maybe a friend. Or it might be, you know because of something that has happened in the past, so I call it complex it's not really as necessary, like you know. like an event that had happened, like you know soldiers coming back from war, you know, like they have ptsd because of war related incidents and different things that they experience."
15667.0,Patient,And I.
759.0,Provider,"Am people will complex trauma have experienced different things. You know, not one event, you know, in terms of that does that make sense."
15667.0,Patient,yeah it does. So um. What are some of the symptoms of. Post traumatic stress.
759.0,Provider,"hyper vigilance, people who are always looking over your shoulder in now someone who is you know wary of like their surroundings and someone who has you know, like flashbacks it's a big thing to you know flashbacks to the past."
15667.0,Patient,The flashback hit hit you you like like is it like.
759.0,Provider,"All of a sudden, like people report different things you know they can be out somewhere and then they have the flashbacks of the might trigger them from a passive manton do you have a flashback to you know what has happened in the past."
15667.0,Patient,"Is it like does it come to you, like a memory."
759.0,Provider,are just like a flashback of you know kind of like are you.
15667.0,Patient,There moment.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15667.0,Patient,"hmm. OK, so I guess so. So are there groups going on with for post traumatic stress people with that with trauma."
759.0,Provider,"yeah I don't think we have. A month to share if we have a ptsd group just specifically for trauma, you know, like, I think we have good sir, related to like people's mental health, which can be a great deal of you know, support i'm wonder why you don't you like to do groups."
15667.0,Patient,"I love groups, I went in recovery and that's what we did was groups. Okay, so we we."
759.0,Provider,"You know, currently taking medications."
15667.0,Patient,"No i'm not doing meds right now with a doctor, no."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so. damn it."
15667.0,Patient,"And you know what I did. yesterday. I felt a little more anxious than I have in a long time. You know i'm i'm doing this wellness reboot right for 10 days and so we're eating different like clean eating. And like it was for the first time, you know just a. Just a feeling of anxiety anxious ness. Not that anything bad was going to happen. Just feeling like a little bit of nervousness. Like like your life you just a little nervous you the you know, I was like jittery it wasn't like extra energy like I feel great you know I got so much energy was like. It was different I even took a couple of bear aspirins, just in case you know it has to do with my heart, so you know. i'm not lie, I know what it was, but it was it was just a little different from energy it was just a little anxiousness."
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15667.0,Patient,"yeah little anxiety and it could have easily you know if somebody had picked me the wrong way or some I could it could have turned to the anger. mm hmm it was like borderline it could have easily turned to anger I didn't I didn't do a deep dive to see what was going on. So that was it could have been some type of emotion coming up, and my body feeling it or something. I don't know. Is there like an exercise that I could do when i'm feeling that way, maybe to do a deep dive and see what's what is my body trying to tell me."
759.0,Provider,"yeah you can you know definitely you know see check in with yourself and see what your you know, like what is going on, you can do that through journal work as well you know see I figure out what's going on with you in that moment. yeah okay i'm saying over Dominique a message right."
15667.0,Patient,Now okay okay.
759.0,Provider,"Regarding that you like to do good therapy. Okay, so I sent her over a message and hopefully we can change your care intensity, you know to doing groups okay as well."
15667.0,Patient,"Alright, no. Worries you."
759.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm not too sure how that's gonna look insurance wise to care nine pages, will have to go for that with you, I hope. I put out there, you know so that dominic nose and hopefully we can get that figured out for you okay."
15667.0,Patient,"Okay, so you want me to read my. Okay, so this was this was my first one. Sir, oh no I got some more back here. Anyway, not a lot, though. I wrote check in at the top okay. The first one. Okay, so. Okay here's, I guess, this is my first one. Okay, I always have to put my weight loss and. Allow you know justin just to find out, you know what I mean keep it right here, and the date. And the time so. The check in I was, I was just doing something that builds me up this lady Adrian everhart on YouTube. went through a similar situation with a she calls the guy her art the artist what this guy did he abandoned her you know, at a time when she was her lowest and when she had she had lost a pet you know she was dealing with the death of a pet. and health issues, but the guy just walked out of the relationship after she had been in a marriage. and her husband, they were apart, but she said, they could have got back together, but because this guy came into her life love bombed her. swept her off her feet made all these fake promises and helped her move her husband stuff out of the House right did all this and and future fake egg like it was relationship and then. At this time, you know just dropped her like she was hot. um you know and so she talks about it, she found a journal a journal entry and she made a video about it. And so. She has ways of rebuilding you know little tapes that that are her process. To what happened. But anyway, it says her name check in ABC is to get him back and it's not really to get him back, but to get yourself back."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"to rebuild yourself and. The building work my questions. She as she said what a good thing to do is to ask yourself this question, and she was she had asked herself that question the way he is right now. The way he's showing up right now is this your dream relationship. Is this what you've what you've what you've dreamed about as a little girl. Is this what it what you envisioned."
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15667.0,Patient,"And if the answer is no. Because what you see, is what you're going to get. And that's reality, you can dream and think it's going to get better you can fix them, you can do this and that and that, but the reality is. What you see and how he showing up is what is going on. So I finished okay so that's what she says and that's what I asked myself, and so, then I said, thank you. Blank I know what I don't want in my man. Thanks to him, I know what I don't want. What are you know and so. I guess some work she asked is, what are the attractive qualities that he present. What are those things that that I kind of. saw in him. And so that's a question I would ask myself when doing. She has a manifesting a man, and so you kind of. draw you know you make a man out of scratch basically. qualities and different things that you would like, in your mate so is So what do I want and need in a man, and I wanted to add, I asked you, is there a test for CP I did that already, and so, then. Okay, so this is the other stuff I did I got the grass cut. In the backyard I Bible study did my exercise so so. And then, this I wrote fill up my own cup because I can't I can't. Nobody can feel my cup for me. I have to do the work to feel my own up and before I can give anything to anybody, I have to have my cup for so then. Okay, I asked myself and and I even thought about a book right I just thought about this i'm like because I was wondering what my vision of love looks like from childhood What image did I see and to me, what does love look like, so what what what I came up with when love feels like abuse. You know. When you feel comfortable. You know what I mean, in that I mean if you're familiar. You know what i'm saying. We love feels like abuse when that's when that's what you to you that's love, I mean it's hard to even think that that is a my concept."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"Let me admit, let me accept that that is my concept. And like when when a man shows up for me. i'm not i'm not available. You know, and when he's not available and i'm running after him and try to make him do this and that you know what I mean that's comfortable, for me, because that's what I saw. You know I saw my dad running and my mama chasing you know. So that's to me that's what love look. Like apparently. It feels like love, but it's abuse. So that's one that's one, and so, then another check in was December 5 where it was asking. She was talking about cognitive dissonance. And to stop lying to yourself, because I told you, I was having doubts about."
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15667.0,Patient,"What I have experienced in the last thing i'll say about nine months. That this man. This man pretty much some case hook. right around the time like my we had my husband's funeral. mm hmm and he was there at the funeral. And they're like and the guy that wrote that book he's got a video about how they how they capitalized on death. Because they are predators, and so they're looking for praying and they they enter through that trauma and in within that trauma i'm just using this as a as a metaphor, they hook through the trauma. Because they are not capable of attaching to you, so they attach you to them. You know they're not capable of love, because they have no empathy."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"You know. So with without empathy they you know what I mean the damage that is done even even in this little bit of period of time. The cognitive dissonance. Was damaging to my brain. It was crazy and i've been to i've been I look back on my life man, I have had so much time to do nothing like what I felt that day. mm hmm where it was uncomfortable to my brain, you know what I mean it it actually hurt my brain. yeah yeah yeah you know suicidal kind of hurt. You know what I mean just nervous anxiety all the above. But I hadn't been sleeping that's when I lost. got down to 188 I lost like. 8000 in a long time how much more time I got."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"How much time do I have, I have a little more time."
759.0,Provider,"yeah you have more time yeah, of course."
15667.0,Patient,"Okay okay yeah so. yeah with the cognitive dissonance was one thing and then doubting everything that I have experienced you know thinking Maybe it was me, and you know. it's so fantastical and I will speak to anybody about it, I really don't Maybe my son i'll share a little bit about about it with him I write about it, but for the most part, it sounds fantastical. And if you were to look at this person. you'd never even even when the when he was doing the triangulation and the young lady came over here. And I told her how he was flirting. She said no, he wasn't no he wasn't she started and everything she said, after that, after I told her how I felt about him to. Her whole demeanor changed she started gaslighting me is what they call it. She denied everything that she had said, and her whole story changed. and say it wasn't what. What do we got. yeah what really got me is how. i'm like dang. Because that's heartless when you bring to people at that you know feel the same way about you. You know and you're causing this and being like I said, we were we were friends. Now we don't even speak. Well, you know and and and you can tell you can tell when when there's a break in the the friendship, you can tell when it's no longer the same. You know, and from what I understand they you know, like. You know, you can look forward to a smear campaign, and this is different things, and she would be a perfect witness. i'm sure you know what i'm saying, but but it's just it's just you know I when i'm having those thoughts of doubting myself, I say no, what happened happened and what he is he he is you know now what he's presenting to everybody else. that's between him and Jehovah okay. Because he's in a position of responsibility."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"You know, so there are consequences that. That perhaps may go unnoticed right now. But as far as in the eyes of God. You you know what i'm saying you can't you can't you can't you can't finagle him. yeah anyway, but anyway, it says the reality was. Here we have OK. OK. OK OK so i'm I was talking about cognitive cognitive dissonance I need to stop lying to myself, it says stop lying to yourself what are my beliefs to relieve the anguish, I felt the reality was number one here we have a single brother who is who has responsibility in the congregation. Explain. not married. Nor, in a relationship. Okay that's the impression you got a single brother."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"Now married morally. morally unacceptable in the eyes of Jehovah having a whole relationship emotionally it's like where Jesus talked about. Looking at a woman too long, you know, like what happened to. David with bathsheba. You know how she was out there bathing on the roof right."
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15667.0,Patient,And he looked a little too long. And it led to him committing adultery and causing her husband to get to be killed in battle.
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15667.0,Patient,"uh huh but the thing was he was repentant after you know after it was discovered, you know, he was repentant. But still, it was just looking longingly at something that don't belong to you. And only in marriage. Is it yours. You know what I mean so. So that's where the cognitive dissonance came from i'm like when I came to the realization that there was a possibility to purchase can have a relationship. Without marriage without a actual person when you know i'm saying that's why I said situation ship with you could actually be trauma bonding to a person and in your heart in a relationship with this person. But not just you that other woman is feeling just as deeply as you and then i'm like how many others, because this person uses this it is something that he has to have so relationships are just that they, we are not people to them, we are objects are like like he calls it appliances. huh Okay, like a toaster or TV."
759.0,Provider,So you have fun yeah.
15667.0,Patient,"Yes, you have no feelings no emotion, no you don't matter, in other words. mm hmm so once they get what they want from you, which is supply or fuel as he calls it fuel they either set you back on the shelf, or you know they they have cycles. They have cycles that are so it's like my son was saying is encoded in their DNA. You know. And people can write books about them. yeah yeah so so i'm going to read the rest of this real quick, this is. Our first check in Okay, it says okay without marriage morally unacceptable and jehovah's is OK so that's what I wrote okay yet he's, not only in one he's in to that I know and only because he brought a woman in my face. verse first with me and then second with the new supplier, which I guess is her or flying monkey whatever her relationship is. which I didn't know about until she made it known to me how she felt."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"Both of us just smitten with this man, and it was hard for me to hear it was hard for me to hear her talk about how she felt about it. yeah it was hard and then imagine, because it was so difficult for me, I had to tell her so she was stopped talking about it because I was on the person she could she could share with. My girl here both of us. Anyway, she was hoping for marriage to him, asking me to be her chaperone. You know I wrote about this. And there was there hadn't even been a first date with them, yet you know what i'm saying so she had future he got her future."
759.0,Provider,Plans yeah.
15667.0,Patient,"yeah future plans, so he knows how she felt and how I felt human populated the scenario. To get us together. All of a sudden, she wants to come over have coffee and visit we were friends i've been to that up until I told her how I felt. All this, because he wanted to show me he had options or to one up me also this man, and the reason I say that is because I was doing adrian's stuff before before he brought this girl in my face right. hmm I have been 97 days, no contact. Okay haven't been in it, none of that none, I had I was just you know Okay, you know. mm hmm i'm done i'm trying to detox okay and i'm living my best life dressing up putting my eyelashes old you know i'm saying dress acute in Madrid and my stuff you know not looking. Trying to take myself out of how I was feeling because they want you to isolate and for your light for the light to dim in your in your soul, because they're vampires right they want to drain you. have your substance, so I was fighting against that by. You know, doing things taking care of me by myself, some flowers and putting them on the table, you know what I mean. I have yet to do some declutter work. So just doing things for me, and that was showing see and he felt me pulling away. And also. There was one incident. Where I what I was doing the wellness reboot before. I saw him accidentally because I didn't want to see him, but I went into the store where he is the boss, and so he this girl didn't know where the meat was and so she had to call them over so he came over and assisted me right. And in that event, whole. What do you call it the interaction a gentleman saw me in my beautiful top right because i'm feeling good about myself i'm building myself up. You know i'm not i'm not thinking about having an Adrian says, every time you think about them you pet your heart and send them love. Because they they're like it's like you're over invested in them and it's not equal, so what you what she talks about is there being like a Karma apple and the Karma is yours. If you want to take that Karma back so that's one way you send them love and each time you're taking your Karma back when you start pulling away, they feel it they feel it so. When I was in a store and this man complimented me on my on my top. You know i'm leaving his presence right feeling good got my earphones in got my music feeling good looking good you know got my toes done my nails done and i'm not you know what i'm saying i'm just feeling good about the nita today. So this man said that's a beautiful top you have on and these people are so jealous they are so. what's that word than me and us. it's like hypocritical but it's like there's a saying, good for the goose is good for the gander. There one sided."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,You know what i'm you know the word i'm talking about.
759.0,Provider,There one sided. To i'm talking about to face people.
15667.0,Patient,"know me and a lot of men like I can do it, but you can't. I can't figure, the word, but you know what i'm trying to say he can do it, but I can't you know so when he saw that man compliment me."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"There was like I want up him. You know and it's all about winning for them it's a game and it's always about control it's always about power. whenever they don't feel like they have the power over you, they have to do something to gain that power back. it's about manipulation power and control. and fuel. Those are the three things. And and it's it's important for them it's their life when they don't get that that validation of whatever it is that they have to have they implode. They. You know what I mean so that's priority that's why the relationships without commitment I mean you know, to have a whole relationship with a person, but then the NIH the relationship. mm hmm yeah. Why India, and it was so killer. Is that I feel some kind of weight parading a man in his face. See that's that that's the brainwashing. huh it's crazy, I mean I mean what people say is crazy monkey. yeah I go with you is to fight this and being able to talk about this is just one page I rich. But this is, this is what i'm going through every day. Just and right now, this is like day 50 to. Have no physical contact now I got it down no I can't like homeboy talks about there are six spheres that you cannot enter. One you have no control over which is in their mind if you pop in their mind because they Hoover. uh huh they come that's what he did when he when he did hurt when he brought her into my into my my orbit. That was a Hoover and it was meant to suck me back into. Something that does not exist Okay, so if you if you hover over me, what are you sucking me back into if there's nothing there. But see this is the beauty of the way he's doing everything i'm telling me he can deny so it's plausible deniability for him. If anything is ever brought to light say we go before a committee or something he could say I was, I was because they always play the victim it's never their fault, nothing is ever their fault. So he could say I was stalking him I was harassing him I was obsessing about him I wouldn't let him go, he told me he couldn't have a relationship, right now, because he got problems right. And so that's what I do that's what Adrian says to do before you accept their know, let them know that you're accepting their know you know, let them know. matter of fact. Anyway, i'll show it to you later if I have her stack of cards, but she says X accept a man's note because the man wants you doing this. And now having a life. And if. If they're on hold, if you're on hold for them."
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15667.0,Patient,"You don't want any other me. yeah that's the theory see that's the thing and i'm like that's why I don't I don't want it, I want my Karma back. i'm gonna send them love I got love for him, but I want my life back you know what i'm saying I want my options, I want to go out today or whenever I go out. And she says, except arrows from people even you, you are an arrow for me a feel good arrow. And when that man gave me that compliment for that blouse honey good I was like thank you. I was just wearing my loan cute top from Venus right. From Venus head my. head on my shoulders have my blue bra um I have to wear these big broad right like this. me go straps. But that's already was do. A show with their little shoulder. And I feel good I do my hair was done, I had my I think my hasselblad don't think I had lashes on my nails and I have my little song sandals on. Here you know what and you know what else he do it when we were talking now right because he's a chef right, so I was asking him about some recipes and different things about fish, you know what he told me because they lie like. He told me he don't eat fish."
759.0,Provider,he'll eat fish.
15667.0,Patient,And here recently. He told me he do.

759.0,Provider,You know I never asked for me yeah.
15667.0,Patient,"yeah, what is your diagnosis and we spoke a little bit and he was saying, depression, he did mention depression well, a lot of times. Because this, the thing about it, this is what they say they don't think they have a problem, and when they do if they're pushed to it, where they have to go for for. Whatever reasons, you know, like if they're forced into it, or something. It can be diagnosed wrong, you know it can easily look like depression, because what the one he is he's the vulnerable he's the vulnerable the covert. mm hmm mm hmm we're everything you know. yeah.

15667.0,Patient,yeah he went into the hospital on the 15th of December and networking.
759.0,Provider,and never came home okay.
15667.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah so that's that's how. that's you know what what when I found out. That this guy was a narcissist i'm like where's my. where's my you know they talk about all this little bomb time right where they shower you, you know they talk about if you if you ever I mean it's like. it's like falling in love and you're going on TRIPS and you're doing this and it's just the best time ever right oh my. God, I remember nothing like that. And so what I have found out is different types do it differently, and for his type. They do it with just the way he did with. Because he's a victim. he's the victim story his first wife cheated on him that's what he told. What is she she's my sister wife."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"that's what I call my sister wife right. Anyway, that's what he told her about the first wife he's been married twice."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"So the first wife cheated on but see what i've come to find out is that they project. They project stuff on to you so probably the one who was cheating, if any, was him and how I don't know it could have been emotional cheating I don't know, I have no clue and and you're only way you're going to get the truth is by talking to her. The one, the wife, the first wife. that's, the only way. And for me to he told, he told the girl my whatever. My triangulation purse person is he triangulate it later be with he told her about the first wife. And what happened with them, he told me about the second wife and how she died, you know wanting to please him that was what he said. And what they do, they even use that to triangulate you, because what they want to do is tell you how to add, you know they say oh. This happened, and this hurt me so bad, and so, then the person that's listening costs you feeling sad for them, because they are such a victim you say oh i'll never do you like that you know. i'll never i'll never i'll never do it to you all the time they're. messing with this."
759.0,Provider,yeah. yeah. it's a lot of weakness right.
15667.0,Patient,"It you know what this is a whole, this is i've had them in my life."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15667.0,Patient,"When looking back they've been there, but it was never as clear. To me, as it is now. mm hmm you know if I didn't have this clarity I wouldn't I wouldn't even think that much about it. But to see how he sowed how it just unfold it. Step by step, because of that DNA how it's how it's ingrained in their DNA the playbook all of them go by the same book. The DNA coding."
