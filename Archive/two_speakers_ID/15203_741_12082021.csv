I go like I go see a therapist there at least once a week well actually lately, to be honest with you because she's been sick and hasn't been in the holidays. But I usually go once a week and I was doing like a program to where they can because I like certain in a in a I don't I like some, but when my history in the past with them. It was. There was a lot of dealing going there you know what I mean that I felt like it was. Like his medical meetings in a way, and I didn't get anything from it, like, I was to focus on on what they were doing as to the group itself and. So what they have here at my family guy at Center like it's like a closed group it's you know, like it's almost like a class in a way, I can I have. not seen that, like I said about three times a week. I just want to because I guess they. Because of holidays dinner together so wait for."
741.0,Provider,"That and. That, and you know, after a while you kind of back off a little bit as you get better and but also, I would encourage you to check out the meetings online because. It has a different atmosphere. You know there's a lot of a celebrate recovery online now and that. will create a whole new atmosphere. For it. So check out."
15203.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you. yeah that's actually like I flights i'll be a lot, because I love what the meetings themselves have to offer like I actually like that's fuel for me, you know. by the fact that you can you see that you know court order to be there has to be there because they have. hour right."
741.0,Provider,"yeah and I I understand that's really distracting which makes this platform, a whole lot better and. Right you're still going to have that but it's not it's not right there in your face and and the other thing that I suggest is that you look for meetings that are going to talk about solution, how do I live today what happened Oh, there you are. lost yeah."
15203.0,Patient,"I know, so what happens is."
741.0,Provider,"I don't know okay so but you're going to want to look for meetings that that talk about the solution, how do I live today clean I don't want to hear about all the crap back way back when. And how wonderful it was because it for me."
15203.0,Patient,"I want to hear about how do I do this, how do I do life on life's terms. Today right."
741.0,Provider,"How do I get through the muck. Without using. The stuff that I want to learn. that's what I want to hear about. So when you go into a meeting, whether it's in person or online that's still what I want to hear. I don't want to hear about all that other stuff."
15203.0,Patient,So.
741.0,Provider,"um and you hear them say stick with the winner because there's always a core group of people who are clean and sober. The meeting wouldn't exist. right because I guarantee you, the ones who are out there, doing stupid stuff are there they're not capable of keeping a meeting going. Right so. that's one thing that you kind of have to think about when when you start looking at meetings. Okay, so you um you. Are not I have you been prompted by the legal system to come to bright heart like to come to."
