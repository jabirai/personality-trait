44.0,Provider,hi good morning angel. Dr Malik nice to meet you.
3343.0,Patient,Nice Nice.
44.0,Provider,So tell me how we can help you out.
3343.0,Patient,was on suboxone for about a year and I had a relapse. And wasn't going to my meetings my mom had a. heart attack and stroke. And i'll say care of her for a while. And now i'm when I went back to relapse i'm going through my withdrawals again.
44.0,Provider,"Okay, when did you relapse more frequently. and"
3343.0,Patient,Not a week ago.
44.0,Provider,"Hello there sorry about that. Can you hear me. Sorry. i'm sorry sorry my Internet cut out for a second so. Tell me a little bit about when did you when did you realize, most recently."
3343.0,Patient,And then we could go.
44.0,Provider,"But a month ago okay and you're with very hard health previously so. Alright, can you hear me any better right now. Okay okay let's see if that connection is better I may need to reset my Internet and it cuts out one more time okay. So I could sing better. Alright, so tell me i'm sorry I asked like to hear what you said you're with bright heart health previously that correct. Yes, what is the last time you went to a meeting with bright heart health."
3343.0,Patient,"it's been. want to say two weeks only because they switched over from natalie natalie was my. physician or whoever, whatever you want to call it, and then, when it got switched over to Isaiah Isaiah had me going to monday's groups, instead of Thursday groups with. Which confused me and then things were getting messed up and I was just getting so aggravated with. Things changing and. I think another reason why I relapse because my frustration will so high, and then my mom had having a heart attack delicious can much I think it's been like two weeks. And I missed a couple before that, but my mom was going through her issues."
44.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so why don't you just quickly tell me a little bit about how you became. How you started to get over use disorder, how you became addicted to opiates you guys give me a short version, and then we can come up with a game plan moving forward so when did you start using opiates and how did you become addicted to them."
3343.0,Patient,I had a back injury about 10 years ago and the doctor put me on percocet. 7.5 milligram and. I just stayed on them for years because of my back.
44.0,Provider,yeah and also how about how old were you when that happens. around what.
3343.0,Patient,I want to say 2526.
44.0,Provider,"Okay, so in your place so prior to that you had not use opiates."
3343.0,Patient,For you.
44.0,Provider,and about how many years were you kind of abusing opiates for.
3343.0,Patient,"I don't think I was abusing them, I was using regularly and I wasn't running on my script. But then I want to say towards last two years of what I was like 3233. I noticed, I was running a little bit shorter on my script. As time went on, and then I realized wait a minute i'm taking a little bit more than I should. And then I was running out, and then I was trying to find some on the street, because I. didn't want to be sick and I didn't understand what it was at first, because, like I said. I haven't gone through it, so I didn't know and then the doctor was like you know, maybe you're using too much and then she went referred me to pain management. And then. I didn't go to pain management, I had went to see a dentist and he gave me like it in and I didn't realize what I did. By putting in for vicodin and having a script for percocet so then my doctor took me cold Turkey off percocet after that so then that's when I went into culture being had to go through withdrawal really bad."
44.0,Provider,"Good all right so you've been let's start with right heart health, about a year or. Two years ago, a year ago now okay looking through your records here, so a year and a half ago, is when you start with bright heart health is natalie. So okay. All right, and then. Most recently, when you started when you relapse what drug that you've been using now that you've been getting off the street."
3343.0,Patient,percocet same thing.
44.0,Provider,For that okay any heroin use ever.
3343.0,Patient,"Never i'm afraid that's one thing that I always told myself, because you know I know other obviously other people who take percocet that have transitioned into heroin and that's one thing that i'm just like. I know, once you go to percocet it's hard for you to get back, but my mentality is like once you hit heroin there's no turning back. that's what scared me."
44.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you put yourself in dangerous situations to get the percocet in the past, or even currently. No, no, and then have you. sort of burnt bridges with you know social and family relationships, because it will feed us."
3343.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
44.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you like not take care of responsibilities like work or school or childcare and like that, because of opiates."
3343.0,Patient,it's um it's it's the weirdest thing if i'm on opiates it's like I could be a functioning person every day. To be off of it and go through withdrawals and be on suboxone I have no energy to do anything I don't want to get up I don't want to. You know I don't I don't have the energy to do a thing.
44.0,Provider,Even when you're on suboxone. yeah but. What happens. When you take the suboxone like what. It doesn't help you really.
3343.0,Patient,"Honestly, I really don't think it does, I think that it just it numbs the withdrawal. Like the needle effect that I feel like anxiety. But as far as like the energy to get up and do anything or to live life or to get a job or anything like that I don't have that drive."
44.0,Provider,"Okay yeah i'm looking through your chart here. That says i'm looking away and not ignoring you. Because you were taking three scripts a day looks like for a little while. Alright, so that is the maximum dose the three scripts the day. Alright, so you did not think that the suboxone was helping though that's what's out here."
3343.0,Patient,"Right and then like. I tried to go through withdrawal by myself and. I had like a couple strips Left and I took them and, for some reason it just made me feel worse I don't know. Why It made me feel worse. than it makes me scared even take them again because i'm like. I don't want to feel worse than I already feel what i'm going through."
44.0,Provider,"All right, so where I am at is. You know I don't know if we're going to be able to help you or not, I have no problem, giving it a chance. But really I can't offer you much more than what I via natalie has an offering with the three scripts a day and really the maximum that I can offer. What were you trying to what we're what are you hoping to get out of this or What was your goal and coming back."
3343.0,Patient,"I know I know is there something different than suboxone that you guys. subscribe, or is it just an accident."
44.0,Provider,"But nothing that we, we only prescribe suboxone that's all that's all we do here, there is methadone that you can get into as well to that we do not, unfortunately, have any way of doing that that's where you go every day. To a methadone Center and you, you get those every day, they can give higher doses equivalent than we can hear. I don't know. Are there any methadone clinics near where you live, I can you're in bed for that right."
3343.0,Patient,yeah and I doubt it.
44.0,Provider,The southern Ohio or. Northern northern what city is in here.
3343.0,Patient,Like Cleveland.
44.0,Provider,"Oh, your bed for with it would that be, that was a team."
3343.0,Patient,Effort yeah.
44.0,Provider,They spelled it wrong in your chart that's why. There are.
3343.0,Patient,You. The thing with that is I don't drive and might have six year old twin sons and there's no way I could go every day there's no way.
44.0,Provider,"yeah there's something Cleveland but not. good for us. The map here. Yes, so and. There are other options other than suboxone there is a shot called. The withdrawal that naloxone that helps prevent someone from yes, you go into withdrawal, if you take. A purpose that you don't have an opiate it works that way suboxone. I like the lockdown because it helps. Usually helps most people with their withdrawal symptoms and and allow them to have the energy. That you're kind of talking about that you don't get but he saying when you're on Ferguson, you do have the energy to do things. Okay. And then, where you have any books that user them before."
3343.0,Patient,"Know like she would give me she was the first started on it 7.5 milligram and then she took it out and, like a five milligram and I was getting like 60 a month I don't think it was like that much."
44.0,Provider,Okay.
3343.0,Patient,And i'm thinking.
44.0,Provider,"Okay, I have a recently on the street, how many were using other time on the street, to keep to get your energy level back."
3343.0,Patient,I would get like a 30 milligram and it probably would last me a day.
44.0,Provider,30 milligrams of photo and yeah yeah that's quite a bit. And where you just take the pill whole or you snoring them are correcting them.
3343.0,Patient,"Now, taking them home."
44.0,Provider,The whole day.
3343.0,Patient,"But actually I would cut it in half, because I knew I had to. keep some for Labor later so i'll do like i'll cut it in half, take a half in the morning and then I have at night. Okay, just I wouldn't have to go through withdrawal."
44.0,Provider,"Right right right. So that's where we're at hanging, I know I understand your frustration and then our groups will be Monday morning at 9am that's like the only time I do group so. Will you be able to make that meeting."
3343.0,Patient,yeah I get my kids off to school at eight.
44.0,Provider,Right. So you want to price a box on again or.
3343.0,Patient,"As long as um is there any way I could get like in my anxiety meds he put me on boost barone but that did not work, I don't know if you could tell in my chart. I told him a long time ago, I had anxiety problems and they put me on use barone and I kept telling them, I was on them for so long, and they did not work, and then they still decided to put me on views burn and my anxiety is like. through the roof."
44.0,Provider,"Okay, so I do not prescribe these brown or anybody will help drugs through this program. Dr cell she is a another physician that worked with bright heart health she's nice like high interest she have a family doctor, but she does do mental health with medicine as well too with psychiatric medications so we could set you up to see her. well. If she can help you from a mental health perspective. That would be an option, but I do think you, you probably need more than I can offer you. I think you need do you have a psychiatrist that you see. I think you probably need to see a psychiatrist and you have resources in Bedford and are there, so there shouldn't be selling between university hospitals and Cleveland clinic and. You shouldn't be able to get access to a psychiatrist. But like that, if you can't. You know, we can do the virtual appointment with Dr cell is a possibility. And I think she's still taking new patients."
3343.0,Patient,Okay.
44.0,Provider,"But it does sound like you, you. You have what we call dual diagnosis or multiple diagnosis, where you see it over eustace or by sound that you also have anxiety probably have a degree of depression i'm guessing had there been traumas in the past, you think he's ever from post traumatic stress disorder. So you know I think I think you need a sort of a multi pronged approach here. I think no one, I think, maybe that may have been part of the problem is, if you were trying to get everything from Isaiah to natalie I just don't think it's possible for one person to be able to do all the medical needs that you need. Because again you're from what you're telling me you're not taking a great deal of percocet. Whereas the suboxone the dose that you were on was quite a bit that's really the highest dose that I prescribed. And so, if that wasn't helping you then I think it's either two things one you're not getting enough suboxone or you have other things going on and I don't think it's I think it's the second one, where you have more things going on since just opioid use disorder. And I think we need to treat all of them, not just I think a treating any one isn't going to help you and you get to treat them all sorted together but it's gonna be a lot of hard work, without a doubt it's not going to be. And they're going to be ups and downs and it's going to be frustrations, I know that. You think you're ready to put in that kind of work and effort. Okay, so we can do is. i'll have let me see if one of the care navigators around. we'll probably have to have you do, you have the number for the virtual clinic. Okay. So we'll have to have you probably join the virtual clinic and let them know that you want to schedule an appointment with Dr sell. yourself. cel I can let me. i'll send the her name. You can write it down to Dr sell for. And then, it is important that you. Have you have you been attending your individual therapy sessions with bright heart health previously."
3343.0,Patient,Ever since my mom got sick I have it.
44.0,Provider,"Okay. That is something that's going to be important as well, for you, that you're going to have to attend. Your individual therapy appointments, as well as your weekly. group therapy appointment as well to where you where you see me get your medication. So I think we, I think I think we can help you and you think it's gonna be a lot of work, and I know we have the resources and the ability to put that work in I just want to know that you're ready to do that as well too because it's going to be a challenge. Okay. All right, so yeah so what's your the virtual clinics, let them know that you want to meet with Dr sell to get set up when you use of opiates using opiate yesterday was that correct."
3343.0,Patient,It yesterday morning.
44.0,Provider,"How far do what role, are you now."
3343.0,Patient,um. it's like my. I know it's hard to explain to people. it's like I want to travel in my arms and my legs and i'm going to call to Hudson I have diarrhea I feel like throwing up. I just want to lay in bed.
44.0,Provider,Good and will you be able to go to the pharmacy today.
3343.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
44.0,Provider,"or or all right so. I can send the prescription oh refer for suboxone will do this film will do three a day, what I want you to do today is to. really just take two strips today so take one sort of early afternoon and the thing one before bedtime starting tomorrow, go to three a day okay."
3343.0,Patient,ask you is Is it too soon to take a suboxone or.
44.0,Provider,"So you want to wait at least 24 hours after your last percocet that was yesterday morning. that's I think one. In the afternoon today because I do want you to be in pretty bad shape I want here with all to be really, really, really bad before you can take it if you can wait till tonight that would be better. But you're starting to feel as bad as you're saying that I don't know if waiting till tonight is is feasible, do you think it is or it will work better, if you wait till tonight for sure."
3343.0,Patient,yeah that the world.
44.0,Provider,"Is longer I will be better for you, but in the short term, maybe too much so there's a balance that's why I want you to only take two scripts today not three."
3343.0,Patient,"So maybe the last time that I took us a box and it was too close to the time I took the percocet is that way it made my withdrawals worse, they."
44.0,Provider,yeah it definitely can you remember what the timing was like I said I always say at least 24 hours with the perfect segue.
3343.0,Patient,"can only be only way is like eight hours because I started to feel anxiety. Okay, and I hate that feeling of anxiety so out thought Okay, I know i'm."
44.0,Provider,"I can also work a few quantity, which can help with get you through this afternoon that's not a problem."
3343.0,Patient,I didn't hear you i'm sorry.
44.0,Provider,"I can prescribe you some clarity that is a medicine that is used to treat the symptoms of withdrawal and it can help get you through this afternoon that's not a problem and then try to get you to wait, as long as you can to take the suboxone. For sure you want to wait at least 24 hours after your last purchase at those. yeah, the only way to eight hours between doses then yeah that would it would absolutely put you into withdrawal. it's what we call precipitated withdrawal, so this is a box on the way it works is it caught, it can force you to go into withdrawal, if you still have opiates in your system, so we need to let all the opiates wash out of your system completely before you start the clock zone. And the way we know you have the least amount of opiates in your system to the worst year. withdrawals crawlers to the worst, you withdrawal is, I mean the less opiates you have in your system, and then the suboxone come in and takes over those receptors on your brain and then blocks those receptors from having withdrawal symptoms again. Have you ever been on quantity before. No Okay, and what other medicines you take nowadays."
3343.0,Patient,I was asking Isaiah put in for my get a patent does I have restless leg syndrome. I know that helps me. At least sleep at night time.
44.0,Provider,"Okay, see I do not prescribe that so. Really, I stick to just opioid use disorder and withdrawal related medications no again, I do think you probably need to have a regular family doctor as well to to kind of take care of your overall health needs. Because it does sound like you have a lot going on, and I think like I said, you need to have multiple physician that multiple resources available to you."
3343.0,Patient,"And I asked why the other doctors were able to prescribe the. Because I like I said I got two kids I can't keep going to. three different doctors, I know it's it's for my. My own. sanity and health but it's like that is just way too much to go through dealing with two kids by myself."
44.0,Provider,"Oh, so their physician assistant or nurse practitioner they end up you know I don't know what what they feel comfortable with and what their training level bar is addition. You know I feel comfortable on what I know how to do and what I know how to do well, I don't deviate from that so. Like if you would like, we can see by the. can take you back and for his group as well to that not a problem as well if he's willing to do those medications but like I said i'm really just willing to do the treatment for opioid use disorder and you know withdrawal symptoms. cell, I know, can help with some of the mental health issues. But you definitely need a family doctor as well. yeah Dr sell would be able to do it through this through telehealth just like this is part of bright heart health."
3343.0,Patient,"Okay, is there a way that because I just can't go to three different places for medications it's not. it's not I don't even know how to explain it."
44.0,Provider,Great well really i'm just asking you to have one extra place because Dr cell and I are doing things via Tele health so. would be one physical doctor's office that you need to go to for the for your family doctor.
3343.0,Patient,can send me in a script for this month and I could find a family physician.
44.0,Provider,"Oh, I don't I can't answer that I don't know."
3343.0,Patient,Who can I ask.
44.0,Provider,A local clinic and see if I the willing to see you again.
3343.0,Patient,it's gonna take forever for him to even see me oh my God.
44.0,Provider,"Oh yeah no I don't think you're taking the RON did really in your best interest, I think I think you're going to get into a proper proper regimen is the way to go. oops. At your property record again. i'm gonna pull up your pharmacy record again to see when your last neurontin. Okay, so the beginning of July, you got a month supply and then the end of. August, you got three day supply okay. Okay, so you've been often around for quite a while that looks like right. yeah okay so yeah yeah and I definitely will not be prescribing you good it's pretty much locked out of your system and, like I said I don't think it's the best drug for you. Right now, I think. So that's where we're at. Like I said, if I was able to see you, that would be your That would be an option as welcoming to people as if it's private that's not his decision. But yeah right now, in my opinion, I don't think the writing is what you need, I think you need suboxone I think you probably need a little bit of help. some kind of need to help you get through the withdrawal symptoms over the next few days, and that I think you need to see a mental health provider that work on. Some of those issues, and I think that will help with your overall energy levels and sleeping all those kind of things. So. You want me to send the prescription first of October."
3343.0,Patient,"Yes, thanks."
44.0,Provider,"Okay, and then we could also use the quantity and as well, too, so the cloud me that's the medication. it treats the symptom that we know so suboxone tries to treat the root of withdrawal, you know, try to create actual opioid use disorder. clonidine works on give it a bandaid drag you just treat the symptom the withdrawal, one of the side effects of high, and even though they can drop your blood pressure, do you notice your blood pressure, run normal or low or high."
3343.0,Patient,Excuse me hi.
44.0,Provider,"hi okay so. climbing can drop someone's blood pressure and it can make you dizzy so that's really the the big warning sign, I want you to look for is. If you do take the clarity and kind of make sure you're in a position where you can kind of sit and rest if you need to. If you do start getting dizzy from it just drink lots of water that's really all you can do to kind of counteract the medication and then it usually wears off the first dose or two of auditing be expected to make you dizzy I typically recommend taking it. At night, for the first time, but since for. You your we're going to try to take it, so that you can. get through the withdrawal in the lineup for the hard for you to wait till tonight to take it. But you can use that throughout the weekend, if you need to if you're having what you know cravings or withdrawal symptoms in between those of the box Ellen you can't take one of the quantity okay. Are you there angel. Hello angel. So. yeah so i'll just kind of going over the quantity, you have any questions on how the quantity going to work."
3343.0,Patient,Just like a band aid to help me overtaken take this action.
44.0,Provider,So it takes a box on the either did you get the part about making me dizzy.
3343.0,Patient,yeah district.
44.0,Provider,"yeah drink lots of water. And then typically I recommend taking it for the first time and date so they can just go to sleep, so if you do get to the not that big of a deal, but for you, with your kids this afternoon and I want you to try to take it this afternoon, if you need to. It can help with can't get through the withdrawal a little bit to get through to the evening, do you play I take this box on the afternoon or do you plan on trying to wait believe need to take it."
3343.0,Patient,"i'm really going to try to wait as late as I can, as. I don't know."
44.0,Provider,"What i'll do last under construction over right now what i'd recommend as soon as you get the quantity. Take you know after you get home go ahead and take one of the quantities and see how you do see if it helps you or not, and then just kind of wait, as long as you can, after that, to take the first suboxone. Okay, and then go to the virtual clinics asked them to make an appointment with Dr cell. And then to get you back set up with your individual therapist and then I will see you Monday morning at 9am here and not in this group, but you'll get the group room number, do you want me to give you the group remember now, or do you have it somewhere. Oh, they should. They should be like that, with the reminder. yeah."
3343.0,Patient,Okay.
44.0,Provider,"But definitely go to the virtual clinic after this and asked to see Dr sell for mental health mental health appointment. Okay, and then they can say I do recommend finding a family doctor just getting established so that you can get your overall health and like I said right now it's just asked me to see one doctor. Traditional basis and their office. then go from there okay. All right, angel I will see you Monday morning at 9am that. Day."
3343.0,Patient,You too.
44.0,Provider,"And it just so you know that, even though it's a holiday we're still meeting this Monday at nine okay."
3343.0,Patient,Okay.
44.0,Provider,"All right, bye now."
