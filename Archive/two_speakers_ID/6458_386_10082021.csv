6458.0,Patient,"Oh yeah now that you said that now that I noticed that maybe that's why my nose, maybe that's why some people."
386.0,Provider,"sinuses it all affects each other and that's why I asked, have you recently relapse using any illicit substances methamphetamine anything at all."
6458.0,Patient,"No, I have."
386.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to be just really upfront with you okay so i'm not too sure on what the care plan is, at this moment. um what I just read based off of message that was done on at 923 last is that. There was discharged discussion happening okay I don't know if somebody told you that already, but there was a possibility that you were going to be discharged for higher level of care just. And when that when that's notated it just means that you may need some additional assistance in regards of your care team, and so we were looking into referrals for you, I don't know exactly where that's at right now i'm. week so."
6458.0,Patient,"Actually. I said don Cassandra and Dr cell and. It was the 30th and we discussed other magic is because I was in another State and that's why they were talking about this this charging me I, I believe, is because they couldn't prescribe in that state."
386.0,Provider,"Okay, that makes sense, I was just like I i'm looking at him like I can't tell you exactly what's going on, but I can know that there's a I know that there has been discussion and so. that's that's one of my. concerns on the uds that was collected on 914 is still not signed off on yet um. wow and so it's there's just been it's it's kind of like the the they're leaving a little messy here, and so I just wanted to be just really upfront. Right now, with your care details I have you currently enrolled in our program for opioid use disorder and it looks like you, are last checked in on 930 2021 and your next appointment is this upcoming on the 12th it says on which is Wednesday i'm. No, excuse me that's Tuesday and that one is, for I believe individual therapy and the 13th was group if i'm yeah so and agile therapy on. That well."
6458.0,Patient,"Go ahead Okay, and that has been calling the also be because she knows that my wi fi has been bad those days, and she was calling me she called me on Friday and Saturday."
386.0,Provider,"Okay perfect she's amazing Dr cell is absolutely amazing. And then I mean it looks you know when i'm looking at it, it looks like you scheduled appropriately, you have individual therapy and group and met follow up scheduled. For continuation and so i'm not thinking that they're going to be discharged to you right now, but what is right, but what is recommended per care intensity is that you. Currently, are supposed to be scheduled of three times a week for care groups. So you'll have your normal Wednesday group and then what they're wanting is you to be seen for care groups to additional times per week. And they have multiple care groups available on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday with you being Eastern standard time highly unlikely Friday. Because that one is scheduled. At 10am Eastern standard time Thursdays is scheduled at noon. wednesday's is scheduled at 11."
6458.0,Patient,"yeah Thursdays at noon would be good, because then I visit my daughter at 330. God it's so cute wednesday's wednesday's."
386.0,Provider,"wednesday's normal group day for you so we'll do Thursday for sure, for you, I will mark that down. And then I have. Tuesday at six in the evening. And then I have Monday at four in the afternoon."
6458.0,Patient,let's be Tuesday at six that sounds good.
386.0,Provider,"So Thursdays so Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is going to be your schedule and that's until they can kind of come up with you know, a solidified care plan for you and get you back on track okay."
6458.0,Patient,Right right.
386.0,Provider,They will I have your email Michelle. Do ordinary life 1975 at gmail COM.
6458.0,Patient,Yes.
386.0,Provider,"Perfect So when I what i'm going to do is i'm going to send a message over to the care navigators to send you a confirmation for those both of those meetings. That way, you have it in your email, I can give you verbally, the meeting ID numbers for both days if you'd like I have no problem doing that. So your Tuesday meeting ID number just let me know when you're ready."
6458.0,Patient,i'm ready. Is 962962347434 743-237-3237 yes.
386.0,Provider,"And then your Thursday care group. Okay, and so what i'm going to do the prescription recommendation at this moment in time is no taking that because of the multiple no shows in the last 15 days. That your prescription is to be reduced to a two day supply, with no additional refills don't want to do that because it's the weekend, so I want to make sure that I can get you covered at least until an appointment does that, if that makes sense."
6458.0,Patient,You will not leave Tuesday.
386.0,Provider,"yeah and so on this upcoming Tuesday, you will have to go to that care group because you have individual therapy and then Wednesday, you have your normal group but do go to the care group on Thursday, just to. Make sure that they're aware so. You will not go to care group, if you have like individual therapy or another group scheduled. Okay."
6458.0,Patient,I think I misunderstood myself when she was explaining I didn't understand that there was a care group I thought that she meant like see her once a week see Cassandra once a week and then go to group once a week.
386.0,Provider,yeah.
6458.0,Patient,What it meant I didn't and then I also have Julie for mental health.
386.0,Provider,yeah.
6458.0,Patient,So I was like.
386.0,Provider,"it's a little messy yeah that's why i'm saying looking at it. I mean it looks like there just needs to be like a solidified. Care plan and with you, going if you're going to go Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday for care groups for groups, then you will still be required to do your individual therapy, at least I believe it's two times a month is what they currently have you set."
6458.0,Patient,up by monthly yeah I want to see him. I told him I want to see somebody at least once a week.
386.0,Provider,"yeah so individual therapy, as a minimum. Of twice a month for you, for individual therapy. But you will the kit those two care groups that we just set up is going to be very similar to almost like a peer support it it's not ran by the prescribing physician so it'll just be like a different therapist available and so you'll end up meeting different therapists um and so. i'm like. For example, tuesday's is with Sean i'm failing and then Thursdays is with Jesse fish jack, I believe, is how you say it, but so that is that those are. Who, we have right now for the Tuesdays and Thursdays and then your normal Wednesday group is still with the provider and the therapist you froze can you still hear me. disconnected at 12:37pm Pacific standard time start time was 12:24pm Pacific standard time to 12:37pm Pacific standard time.
