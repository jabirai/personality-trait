480.0,Provider,hi how are you.
5893.0,Patient,"Good sorry i'm late, I was talking to my mom about. She found some. She found that they're doing. Like all the big hospitals like children's. The children's hospital that they're doing. The shots. And stem cells and all that for kids with optic nerve hyperplasia. Which is God, which is what my daughter has."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's exciting.
5893.0,Patient,"And, but my problem is is i'm trying to convince my doctors cuz when I first found out she was diagnosed, which was at the children's children's national hospital in DC. that's when I found out she was six months old when I found out that with that she was that's that's what she had and they said it would affect her pituitary gland which the pituitary gland affects her growth, and you know. hormones and all that. That the doctors at her daughter, you are pretty patricians office they're like no doesn't affect that and i'm just. Like oh oh so i'm trying to gather up all the proof, I can show them look and my moms like yeah the the research shows that she needs to see an endocrinologist because. She was born with she had like a hairy back not like a lot of here, but you know that some babies are. yeah exactly. um but she still has that and she has like little hairs on her nose that you can't really see it unless you get real up close. yeah she has like you know little bit of dark hair right here. And, of course, she gets picked on for it. yeah and she's scared to do anything about it because she's scared it's gonna grow back 10 times worse. Which is actually true especially these hairs I remember."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so it wasn't the mustache but I had little peach fuzz like right here."
5893.0,Patient,And I was probably hide it right here.
480.0,Provider,"So it was either middle school or high school, I decided to shave it with a razor and ever since then it grows back like thick black hairs so I have to plug it almost every day because I used razor one time."
5893.0,Patient,same here I didn't use a razor but um I did I did walk in a this day it's still the same thing they still grow back thick and it hurts.
480.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly and it's rough like when I if I haven't plucked him in a while, because they're not so noticeable right, you can only see them if it's like direct sunlight. Because they're small but they're thick and so, if I don't pluck them and i'm just like touching my face they're really rough. yeah so freaky."
5893.0,Patient,"I got I didn't even notice, I had like black hair is right here until this boy in my class, because I was 16 he's like Oh, what do you got a five o'clock shadow and I never knew what that meant, and we know them and it no that was you know hey you know hair. And then. When I got home I looked in the mirror you see what he was talking about, and I was like oh. man."
480.0,Provider,is devastating at that.
5893.0,Patient,"Age it is you know because yeah in school, you can get. picked on for the tiniest little thing man."
480.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely my middle has been bullied because he's a boy, and he likes to paint his nails and color his hair. He paints his nails blue and colors are blue, but he still gets picked up for that. So silly."
5893.0,Patient,It kids are cruel.

480.0,Provider,The surgery or this issue.
5893.0,Patient,"Oh no the optic nerve hyperplasia. Oh no what what she has is not as I don't know if it's a surgery, I mean the stem cells yeah it's probably a surgery or unless they take the stem cells and inject it somewhere, but there's like these injections they they try and. I don't know if there is a I know they're working on like a optic nerve placement surgery or something like that."
480.0,Provider,Oh cool.

So at school, they gave her some you know stuff to help with reading is they print out. Large sheets of it's like large sheets of paper with big print on it so she can see. But when it comes to test time they don't put her in a row and i've been getting on about that, like look she also has ADHD she needs to concentrate she needs to be put in a room or she has no distractions. I mean the doctor even wrote a note saying that she needed that."
480.0,Provider,Does she have like an IEP or 504 plan through the school.
5893.0,Patient,"She did have I EP but they said she graduated. From it so they should we had our last meeting, but they said, if she ever needs it again, she can always go through it, but because she passed all the things she was supposed to. For the IEP but or with the IP thing but um I was like well she's not losing her like vision therapist person and they're like, no, no, she still has that person so that's good."
