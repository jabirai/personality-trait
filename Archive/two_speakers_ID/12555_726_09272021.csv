12555.0,Patient,"Well it's been a little bit better the past couple days have been like. A little more cloudy. Like movie so it's like darker and that's always really hard for me when it's like dark. I get like seasonal depression too so. Now that it's getting into you know fall at least a little bit is starting to feel and like and, like the sun sets earlier. Certainly feel a little more. Like depressed at night. When it's dark. But I do have I did pull out, I do have a son lamp. That I use. So I pulled that out the other day. and using that. When I feel like I really need it so. awesome I helped a little bit. And I still is still you know just hard to have it be like 730 and it's completely dark outside and you know. And it's only going to get worse until."
726.0,Provider,You know I just wonder.
12555.0,Patient,"You know. We have to kind of stick it out until December and then and that's sort of like it helps me to know like that's the point I have to get to. It until it starts to go the other way, you know. yeah so."
726.0,Provider,"It sounds like this position is coming at the perfect time then because, then you are going to be more involved in that restaurant that you're at so it's not going to be like not feeling good. And i'm also just full all the time. But yeah I feel like doing something that's outside of the House."
12555.0,Patient,"yeah I totally I feel like it'll help it may help a lot like just to take my mind off of it and feel like i'm doing something you know. So and i'm really glad about that it's going to be a in the evenings too so i'm hoping that that will help me like. Just have some need to do in the evenings when it's dark and it feels like you know when i'm just sitting at home, it just feels like that's, the only thing I can think about sometimes just. dark and sad. Like. i'm hoping that this will help me, be able to just not think about it and be doing something so."
726.0,Provider,yeah that's an awesome. How is your boyfriend and. Being home and his work and because I know that you had said that you felt like maybe he was getting a little bit depressed.
12555.0,Patient,"yeah he's up and down. Just like he's been really unhappy with his job. And he's still really unhappy with this job like he he's he's trying to at least find other things to do. That will. You know, make him happy so he's been doing a little bit better since we found like a. Like a weekend volleyball meetup. So we both go out on Saturdays like Saturday mornings, and he plays volleyball and I just sit and watch. So, like just just like little things like that that he's trying to find a do that was going to make him happy. So i'm hoping, he can buy more things. But yes, just like up and down. And you know, during the week it's hard."
726.0,Provider,What did they do for work.
12555.0,Patient,he's an executive assistant to like a partner in a big business management from.
726.0,Provider,All kinds right.
12555.0,Patient,So MIA and his his boss doesn't really have a whole lot of work for him to do. and make really loves to work. Like a lot. So that's why he's like. not really very happy. Because you shouldn't have a whole lot to do.
726.0,Provider,yeah I can imagine that that. Via after while you're like kind of find something.
12555.0,Patient,"yeah so he just sits around all day because his boss doesn't even come in, he, like works from home, a lot of the time. Nick still has to go in. which I don't understand like he can work from home, too, but he still has to go in every day and so like he just doesn't have a lot to do."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
12555.0,Patient,"yeah so. I don't know hopefully he's going to talk to HR and like see if there's something that can be done, you know, hopefully, they can find."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. While least now that he's because he's already working, it might be easier to find something you know something else."
12555.0,Patient,yeah i'm hoping so. yeah yeah. See. Until then we just kind of have to do things that little things that like make us happy. So.
726.0,Provider,that's good news. Will. I was thinking of doing with you. I wanted to enhance like coping skills and which I know you already have them. On because I was I don't know if i've ever talked to about em vr.
12555.0,Patient,"yeah i've done mtr actually before Oh yes, the last. therapy place, I was at I did a lot of em Dr and it helped a lot."
726.0,Provider,Oh i'm thinking is that something that you have wanted to do I know it's virtual so it's not like an in person situation but. that's something you'd like. To do.
12555.0,Patient,shut up.
726.0,Provider,"yeah okay. Now, when you were on in your the place that you weren't getting therapy before. um did you create a safe place safe place for yourself."
12555.0,Patient,Like. Like just thinking about like a place that is common like.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
12555.0,Patient,almost like a meditation is that when you're talking about.
726.0,Provider,"yeah it's like a place that you create for yourself and they kind of do like the install it. And so, like when you start to feel you know if you start feeling triggered throughout the day or during the week it's kind of a place that you've created with that therapist to help you and help you get grounded."
12555.0,Patient,"um. I don't think we I don't I don't think we know I don't think we did. Talk to you a little bit about that, before. I want to say, I mean i've heard of it but."
726.0,Provider,"So um. Because almost like to its commerce they place and so it's a place that can create and it can be completely imaginary you make it up or can be a real place that you feel safe. So you know you have done processing the forcing know that once you process memories from your past, you might get more insight or you'll have. Memories that come up they meet you know. they'll come through in sometimes people will even dream at night or have dreams of things that they're processing so is that something that happened to you when you were processing before."
12555.0,Patient,"i'm not like not dreams or anything. um. No, no, not really."
726.0,Provider,"i'll were there any memories, that you have forgotten about the came up."
12555.0,Patient,"um. Not that I can remember, no."
726.0,Provider,"yeah everyone's different some people do some people don't so. I think that we will need to do is try to come on I wanted to call base with you or safe place. Because I do think it could be beneficial before we process specific memories. And kind of. just getting into you know understanding what it is that makes you feel safe and calm. And I was actually you know with other clients it's kind of like when you make this place in your mind um I always say to everybody is. If let's say you're coming up with a safe place in that place is somewhere that is like near a beach or at a mountain. is trying to bring something that's tactile or something that you can feel smell or touch to help you so like someone will have that they'll create their safe place and then they have in place essence oil of. let's say cedar trees or. yeah so because it just helps it's like your body for Members really quickly information when its associated with something that you touch feel or smell so that's why. I would like you to kind of think about what your safe place would be, and so we can get creative about what tactile or smell different than that can help you to just kind of enhance it. um. yeah so if it even if it's a sound to some people are more like they listen really well or some people like the light touches really much more powerful for them so it's whenever you. resonate with the best. Okay, so so. What would you if you create a super complex, would it be like."
12555.0,Patient,"It would probably be like some sort of garden, and I think."
726.0,Provider,"Or would it be like springtime summertime like what season, would you be in this garden, or would it be anytime."
12555.0,Patient,i'm. Wrong probably. don't know that's a good question. Maybe like spring.
726.0,Provider,"I always say some warrior. really create this place where it feels so real in your mind that, like you, almost forget that you're creating it that it's it feels really drawn to you. that's when it's really good, because then it's a lot easier to get to that place especially there's not some emotional connection to it so just trying to to create that so it's springtime in the garden."
12555.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,How many when it looks like.
12555.0,Patient,It probably be like a Japanese garden. Like a like a pond and a bridge maybe like a. Small like waterfall.
726.0,Provider,"and Now, when you're in this place um. Can you feel the sun beaming life, do you feel the heat of the of the weather, on your garden, do you hear hummingbirds can you hear the water moving."
12555.0,Patient,"yeah definitely the water. And yeah the sun, a little bit. Like not too harsh but. yeah. it's not too hot."
726.0,Provider,"And this place that you created, so what would you call it what name, would you give it."
12555.0,Patient,that's a good.
726.0,Provider,It can be whatever you want so it's your place.
12555.0,Patient,yeah i'm not sure what I call it. yeah. i'm terrible at naming things.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, you could give it like a very simple name to it, because what we're gonna do is we're going to cue it as let's say you say my garden, so it could be your garden it's your place. So when you think of a place you think like if there's a name for the place. It has to be something easy for you to like remember you know what I mean."
12555.0,Patient,yeah i'm. Probably just name it like Zen or something.
726.0,Provider,"Okay beautiful so we're going to call it as done. So we'll do today is we're going to install it so just like a computer so think of your brain it has all these neurotransmitters going and sending information everywhere to your to your body your mind everything. So thinking about this place we call it Zen alright, so I want you to bring up that image that you created of this garden. And, really, really get really into it in your mind thinking of this place all right, so what i'm going to do is as you're thinking of this eighth place that you've created i'm going to move my fingers okay you just have to follow my fingers all right. yeah so if if it's okay i'm just going to get put my dog outside the chef's barking okay I. want all right, give me one second. All right, there we go."
12555.0,Patient,"My little dog goes crazy sometimes i'm surprised, I have to put them out of the room right now actually so."
726.0,Provider,I always ask did you hear her barking.
12555.0,Patient,"or wine, I heard a couple of wines, but not."
726.0,Provider,"All right, because I mean anytime she sees a person like walking on the streets show Bart so I was like oh my God, please, especially especially something like this because we're installing this information I don't want other noise. yeah that in the way so. So I want you to think about this place that you created okay so it's called the Zen all right so get really into it, when you go in your mind and you think about this place imagine the. Like feeling the flowers imagine feeling the grass on your feet, maybe on touching the water, the wind everything, just like if you were actually there okay. Oh. I just want you to follow my fingers okay. we're going to that place. And we'll begin."
12555.0,Patient,"Like. I know those. Are deflate feel it like. To focus on, you know."
726.0,Provider,"Okay well. And you can just tell me, is there anything having to do with the was I going too slow, maybe or too fast."
12555.0,Patient,"I don't know, maybe I guess maybe too fast."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, I can slow it down yeah just let me know, because this is the this is your session so where I want it, I want it to be something for you okay so just let me know i'll slow it down. Okay right. So just go back to that image in that place that you created okay. And not feel any different at all."
12555.0,Patient,"yeah it was easier to focus, I think. yeah it was easier to like feel myself walking. And like. feeling like the would have the bench. And like. The stones and the grass. Being feet."
726.0,Provider,"All right, so let's let's reinforce it will do more okay. So go back to that last. That last image that you were in okay in that feeling that you had okay."
12555.0,Patient,yeah I could feel like walking further in and like sitting down the ground. Looking out at the pond and like feeling the water carrying the hearing the water.
726.0,Provider,"So when you think about the place, then that you created what. What feelings come up for you as you think of that place, and if you do, do you feel any anything in your body that comes up when you think about it."
12555.0,Patient,Just feels like peaceful. It. feels like. emotional. Because of the peace. That. So feels. Like. A lot of relief.
726.0,Provider,Okay.
12555.0,Patient,Wait wait weight lifted off your shoulders and. yeah.
726.0,Provider,"Can we try something with this. So i'm going to do we're going to go back to that place right so that Zen place that you created and what we're going to set an intention all right, so when we do the fingers and you are start thinking about that place your ask yourself to material life that in your reality right now. is just let's see what what comes up Okay, because because there's this feeling that coming up for you let's figure out. let's figure it out okay so so while you go back to your place and we do that, I movement, I want you to say to yourself. I I send the intention that this that I can feel this way in my in my reality in my life now okay we're just going to slowly introduced it in it doesn't have to be a big bang, it could be a slow, gradual shift okay so just follow my fingers. For you."
12555.0,Patient,Like I don't know how. That can be possible. Because of like the stresses of just living.
726.0,Provider,Most towns. feel do you feel like it's a feeling on. Worries that's coming up. or loss.
12555.0,Patient,yeah like yeah definitely like. Now kindness so last but. grief like sadness.
726.0,Provider,"Well, this is good to know amanda in because right now. In this place that you created is bringing that feeling up. This is a good, this is a good indicator that we can so we can shift it to a better feeling place because this this may then not be a place where you feel. Calm or safe, because now it's bringing up all this other stuff, so now we have an awareness of Okay, this is what's coming up when this thought comes up alright, so we can try something so now, what I want you to do is. You know how you were talking about. The different things in your life that make it feel hard to feel like you're in this safe place or peaceful place. yeah all right, I want you now now we're going to shift gears a little bit I want you to think of yourself like little compartments of all your different worries, so if you're thinking about work home. taking care of your dog all these different things that are coming up for you and why you could go into an image that in created in your mind's eye. That you're putting everything in maybe boxes, maybe bins maybe a storage units right, so the intent is that we're putting each worry in its own box. And what you're telling your worries is that when you put everything let's say imaginary in your mind into the small boxes or big boxes, however, you want to do it put them in containers in your mind and say to them. When i'm ready i'm going to take care of you, but right now i'm going to put you aside, so I can focus on what i'm doing right now, so this is a practice that you could actually use. during the week and you can use this every day if you wanted to. We are it's almost like a simplification and a compartmentalizing of your different worries so. If you can go into your into your imaginary mind. What, what does the what do the boxes, or what did the spaceship look like i've heard people use from my boxes, I hear people use plastic bins I hear them use. orange units, where each section has different things so just create that in your mind okay and i'm going to give you like, like a minute to just kind of get in there in your mind and then you let me know what you came up with."
12555.0,Patient,There are probably more like. plastic boxes with lids. That I set into like a big bigger like shelves of like cubby holes like. And some boxes are bigger than others or smaller others.
726.0,Provider,"More per inch one. Did you put a label on them, are they color coded or are they just like."
12555.0,Patient,yeah there's a there's like a label.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so what I want you to do is mentally start doing that now okay in your mind. And then i'm then i'm just going to ask you to follow my fingers so so while you're in there you're putting all of these different worries in different boxes okay. What came up when you did that."
12555.0,Patient,"Just like. Things that. I need to do. Like I have a list of sort of like a running list of like things that need to get done. which in turn is like things that I like worrying about. So felt like it was sort of that same type of thing where it's like a list of things that i'm currently like trying to figure out how to do, and like. Things that those things that i'm like worrying about getting done."
726.0,Provider,"And I feel helpful for you, putting these things in the boxes."
12555.0,Patient,yeah. If only sold it makes it feel like. almost like it's in its place.
726.0,Provider,"The great thing is with this exercise, you can do this anytime of the day, no matter what you're doing so it's it's there to help. To kind of not feel overwhelmed when you feel like there's a lot going on, so it breaks it up into pieces and it puts it in its own spot all right so. Until until I see you on our next session I want you to try to use this exercise, and just kind of you know, keep keep track of how you feel when you use it if you're finding it helpful or not. Okay, and with it with that exercise, even though it's imaginary it's you're giving your worries and you're actually putting them in. In an image that is tangible to you mentally that you can go to so. So grab on to that memory and know that throughout the week, you can even change that image, you can change the boxes, you can change the placement, but everything has its own spot. Just like a House has a spot for this a spot for that every thought has a spot in your mind in a different place okay. And so. What i'll do is let's. Let me see what we have coming up, if you have anything scheduled. Okay perfect, so we have. an appointment today. We actually have an appointment October 7 at 1pm."
12555.0,Patient,OK OK.
726.0,Provider,And then we.
12555.0,Patient,Is there any way. That we can change that to earlier in the week.
726.0,Provider,yeah. So when you look at my calendar.

12555.0,Patient,Maybe let's look for the week after.
726.0,Provider,"So, as long as you don't have a group during the on that day that we schedule."
12555.0,Patient,"As I can interview phase two sides, our group so Monday evenings."

So amanda so within until our next session I want you to try the boxes that you created your mind. And I just want feedback be as honest, as you want, because this is your session this is your therapy, so if it's not if you feel like it's not helpful, we can change we can shift and we can change it okay. Okay, all right, so I will see you on the 11th."
