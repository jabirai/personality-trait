13222.0,Patient,"know. What does. My mom my mom who has been abused to my mom she's got if you'd have to know where to understand i'm transparent guess but she's got the mentality of a child almost. Okay, where she's very submissive to men she's very you know all they had to do was raise my voice system little bit and I got my way. I kind of ran with that. Okay, she just kind of depressed all the time she ate herself into oblivion, and she was in the bedroom 24 seven in bed. I look back now and it was absolutely severe depression, you know I mean, so I feel bad now but. You know she can she needed to be up she needed to take care of her kids but I don't I don't know if she was equipped with the right, the right ammunition to do so. You know I mean."
740.0,Provider,"The out any kind of resentments or any kind of anything, this was mom because she wasn't very much you need to be."
13222.0,Patient,"No cuz I can look back now, and I can realize that she was dealing with her own shoes. And she wasn't equipped."
740.0,Provider,"And maybe there, maybe the domestic violence really be. yeah to where."
13222.0,Patient,It is shoes shoes absolutely just. submissive to anything that was like I said she almost resorted back to being almost child is. You know.
740.0,Provider,"Maybe there was around the time that she actually sell faith as a child. You know, sometimes we were very back to childhood, because there was a moment in time we actually feel safe."
13222.0,Patient,that's crazy that before.
740.0,Provider,"i'm just I mean hey I mean look at if we use an example, you know. Or we look at who was that we can look at Michael Jackson right, so he shall, who was taken away right because he was in the industry. And so, as an adult em saying he basically reenacted his childhood that he would do, he would have loved to have. You know if he wasn't in the industry and so sometimes maybe if she reverted back to those childhood behaviors it could be a time that she actually felt safe. Or you know felt like she was wanting right I don't know if mom even with any kind of abuse as a child or I don't know what kind of feminine energy here with their pants. But it's always a reason for everything his mom still alive."
13222.0,Patient,"yeah yes, she is."
740.0,Provider,How she with her now.
13222.0,Patient,it's strain. written off by that side of the family. Man she's kind of taken care of by them so she's kind of taken on the same the same approach. But I know once i've got some more clean time under my feet and stuff so she'll start coming around.
740.0,Provider,You said you lost the type of the family wasn't because of your drug abuse behavior.
13222.0,Patient,"Absolutely, they they gave me they gave me a couple chances and. My uncle bill last time they flew me back out to Detroit because I have problems out here, and he said, this is the last time, and you become part of this family otherwise we're gonna we're gonna exile you and Sure enough, he wasn't ready. And they did they did. i'm not allowed to have addresses no nothing like that that's great."
740.0,Provider,"So. Well i'm actually a question. All right, let's see one. So were there any events that out to you growing up like in your neighborhood. Were there any events that out to you growing up in your neighborhood anything that kind of contributed today today behavior."
13222.0,Patient,"um well, I mean just to just living in Detroit area is rough you know. I was exposed to things that early age that you shouldn't be and I just kind of ran with that lifestyle that's you know, I was always kind of joke with everybody kind of said I was raised by society but it kind of was. You know."
740.0,Provider,"What kind of what kind of friends, do you hang around the time."
13222.0,Patient,"None zero I realized that I had to just cut everybody out like cancer, you know I mean. It kind of sucks that way because I got some really good friends, but if there's no good to me if they're using."

And I started mixing myself up with mainly everybody did drugs and was in that scene, because that's. felt comfortable. So maybe make up my friends currently if you want to say, but we equate myself with is it's just all bunch of bad people. yeah."
740.0,Provider,"So now, the any of those train did you bring them over to your abstinent side and did you leave them over there on your you but."
13222.0,Patient,I left them over there.

The journey of sobriety you know i'm saying you can't hold on the phone numbers and text messages can be him being you and Facebook messages that kind of stuff sometimes i'm gonna unfriend people you gotta delete Facebook, I mean. I know hey."

But I you know i've had I have literally a couple of thousand friends down there and I just I have none i'm just trying to think about who was other who all there was you know basically a good influence in I can.

13222.0,Patient,know. You can you kind of pushed me or i'm gonna call her after we get done here.
740.0,Provider,"We can't be solved, we got to be solved in all of our affair. What we've been."
13222.0,Patient,To be to be truthfully honest with you.
740.0,Provider,uh huh.
13222.0,Patient,"You want to manage it to always make to always come in and do these things that I lived out in the middle of nowhere, I had no car like no, you know I mean she was just getting heavy heavy. might want to have three things a week for things we need to do and I had no right and there's no. there's no public transportation I kept trying to tell her this. uh huh no actually my last my last test came clean, but the fact that I wasn't making my other obligations kind of made it to where I was just like Okay, you know what i'm just gonna wait to get in this other program being you guys. and see if I can actually stay clean and now I have been, for you know what a month now, or whatever, and I can see that it's going to work so now, I need to take that next step and patch up that side, the legal side."
740.0,Provider,"yeah that one, I want to hear that would you be talking to me even my outlet, I want to make that we have a face and i'm like I had to go."
13222.0,Patient,All right.
740.0,Provider,"i'm like that's that's what happened, you know they criminal nature, especially when, since you saw earlier recovery. This you battle between the rational brain and the emotional brain, you know you battle between you know wanting to do things the right way, but at the same time, the criminal side to try to pick back up and so it's going to be a battle. I wish I could say it is easy, but it's not. No easy. And I tell clients all the time it's easy to stop it, is it really is really easy, this is easy this back, but it's hard to space that. Is that's the hard part the hard part is when you make a decision i'm not gonna you know more. You know i'm saying, but yeah i'm saying the fat show you. More than you thought. About staying stop you know when I put it down, you know, is it going to stay down and do I have any changes to pick it back up. Man, you know i'm saying and that's and that's the thing and so so yeah, the first thing you do you know when you choose a road of Abstinence is the right or wrong. Right and when you start working the steps and all that kind of stuff and when you start to work those steps and like I said I hope you I hope you get invested in the Program. You know i've i've seen it for a lot of people that it has worked, you know, but you got to put in the work of course. yeah and but you know, but what it does, is that it gives you a community. Right and that's, the most important thing, so that you don't feel like. you're alone, I mean it's good that you have you know your significant other you know i'm there with you but. But I will say this, and I used to carry with us out of time, you know i'm saying, will you go to the me you go by yourself. When you start also to me, she got a homie. will do a meeting."
13222.0,Patient,"That kind of interviews, because you don't you don't know if you can open up all the way you know."
740.0,Provider,"Exactly. yeah you know. yummy maybe the maybe you go one one by tomorrow together, but in regards to going to meet. You both go by yourself, because you want to be able to have the freedom to be able to see to open up and to communicate. And a lot of times you know i'm saying you know when you have significant others, they can hinder your freedom, you know, the freedom to be able to communicate freely. Because you don't want to say that, even though it's really about her, but you don't really want to say so you're gonna be quiet, you know you, you know, in the same way she she she may want to talk about you know hundreds, you know so. it's really, really important for y'all to have your own to work your own Program. Right, you can use each of their support sure you can use each other as accountability, the best part the best package together. But, but you always want to make sure that you're working your own program that you have your own sponsor that you have your own community family."
13222.0,Patient,And here's another thing you gotta be careful when we found this out. We also cosine each other's bullshit as well.
740.0,Provider,"Oh no candy. Because you have to make up in your mind. They even if she uses. i'm at. You gotta be like that right, you have to love yourself your freedom. More. into where if she made the decision you like hey I can say wishing and vice versa."
13222.0,Patient,So.
740.0,Provider,"It should be you know and that's something else to talk about. You know i'm saying like hey these are these are. The the no option turn all right, these are the less later on the time if I do this don't stay with me if you do this i'm not gonna say what you. You know, and you have to look at those one in science, even being able to identify your own words that you're saying identify and hurt and so it's really, really, really, really, really important for you also word individual Program. Okay. And and they're just that's how you do this I you because you need to develop your own support system, you need to develop your own a in a community and by n soda she. She needs to have her own phones and you need to have your own phone, so you know i'm saying, because, since you already live together, that does not mean you have to do a in a together. yeah yeah i'm saying, sometimes you need that sometimes you need to their face."
13222.0,Patient,do need that break.
740.0,Provider,Sure right so yeah but how long have you been together.
