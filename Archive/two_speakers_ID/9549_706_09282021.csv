9549.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i've been doing this now like. Since May I got a sentence in May, so i've reported it to right heart in May, but I gotta do I thought that maybe my senses almost overwhelmed but actually no I go go I O a little over three months still okay so there's feels like it's been forever like i've been going to do forever."

706.0,Provider,"All right, so. What we're meeting for today is to complete your bps your bio psychosocial assessment and it's just basically a bunch of information that we collect in order to help create a. A treatment plan for you, so that we kind of know your background."
9549.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"um, so why don't you tell me what brought you to bright heart."
9549.0,Patient,"Actually i've been in recovery for from heroin. For seven years i've been off heroin for seven years. Almost eight years, I did it cold Turkey with nothing at all, I was late in my mom's bad in detox and after like six or seven months of being off nothing at all. My my daughter's dad actually a drug and alcohol counselor at a place called healing hearts and mansfield Ohio and i've been on and off with him for 12 years we used to use together. and I was working at a place called just plastics, the factory and the drugs were just really bad there, and he talked me into getting put on subs he talked me into going to healing hearts. and be put on subs they tried me on suboxone for the first week I think I took it for two days and ended up being in hospital. It was the first time I ever boxing ever in my life, I felt like I was having a heart attack my heart would raise so fast. I literally thought I was gonna die like I woke up screaming my mom come like she she called the squad like she's a nurse, and she thought I was having a heart attack she didn't know what was going on, I actually have an allergic reaction to it."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
9549.0,Patient,"Oh, my God it was most scariest thing i've ever had an allergic reaction to the no oxygen in it and. I got pregnant with my daughter shortly after so I stayed on the treatment Program. Because they told me they couldn't detox me they couldn't take me down, while I was pregnant, because I had such a hard pregnancy and I have polycystic ovaries. and cervical dysplasia so i'm not supposed to be able to have kids i've already had one that was stillborn and I had her. And I was pregnant with her for 11 months they couldn't detox me off of stuff so I stayed on them and then I ended up getting with my first boyfriend ever in the whole world and. He was just fresh out of a halfway house and he started using and selling men and I never tried before, so I was working at the nursing home 16 hours a day, seven days a week, because we didn't have any help at all and I needed the money, so I just. I just started using it because I needed to stay awake at work. And then I got in trouble for it, and that was back in May, when I got in trouble. Maybe April April man with my sex I got I I caught my charge and he's still he's still in jail way to go to prison he's looking at eight years for. possession of methamphetamines and trafficking methamphetamines he was actually a client with you guys because he when he caught his first hard she got out on bond, but he had to seek treatment, so he seeks treatment, but then. He ended up having to go sit because he couldn't he uh he did good for a long time he failed one drug test he failed one drug test has been sitting in there ever since. And it was like the day after he used he had a drug test for his pto so he's been sitting in their sense, and I was staying out of trouble that's pretty much how it all ran down I didn't like I didn't like drugs for the longest time because my dad was a heroin addict. And then he got he went to prison and got clean and then I got bullied and then I did mess that's pretty much the whole story whole rundown quickly."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so the last time that he used anything was May."
9549.0,Patient,"um no I didn't even know yeah i'm April. hey rosie yeah because when we got our door kickin it was may so April. Because I had already quit. Because I was about to lose my job. Okay kyle I was using but they didn't fire means I was part of the Union and they just didn't have they don't have any help they don't have anybody who can do, who would care at all, besides me and one other girl so. I ended up getting clean and quitting but he got he yeah he got our door kicked in. Okay."
706.0,Provider,I bet that was pretty traumatic.
9549.0,Patient,"yeah actually it was i've never i've never been in trouble before. And my daughter was there, so they see like a flash grenades in our House. Oh, my gosh his grandma was there, because she was sick and I was taking care of her at the time. And she slid out of her chair and they wouldn't let me help her up and they wouldn't help her out but she's like 80 something years old. And like they just made it seem like we were selling drugs out of our House and selling drugs around our kid he wasn't doing that he would leave. And he would go to work or whatever and that's when he would sell his drugs, but because it was at the House, I was charged to because the houses in my name I got. possession of methamphetamines and permitting drug abuse charges."
706.0,Provider,How old your daughter.
9549.0,Patient,she's three to 10 three.
706.0,Provider,So she probably was really confused and scared.
9549.0,Patient,"yeah she's more confused that he's not home like because we didn't really have her around the drugs when the COPs came and she knew about the COPs like she knew I try to teach you that the COPs are good not bad. But her dad girlfriend are like no we don't like COPs at all, they don't help you do anything. And so, she was she's a little bit confused about the COPs as it is, but yeah it scared her they always kick door and early in the morning, so she was sleeping he got woke up to it. It was dramatic. yeah she's more computers that have come he's not home yet like he writes letters and she talks to the letters like she's talking to him. And she talked to on the phone and asked when he's coming home. because she called him Papa but she doesn't know that he's not coming home for a long time. yeah he does come home. we're probably not going to be we're probably not going to associate with him, I mean I talked to him out here and there, because I know what it's like to be in jail and have nobody, and I know that he has nobody beside me and mariah so that's yeah."
706.0,Provider,"wow that's. that's quite a story, and it really is, and it sounds like you had some long periods of sobriety. And so. I mean, and you, I mean you kicked heroin on your own that's amazing that's. Such. A hard thing to do, and the withdrawals that you experience."
9549.0,Patient,are terrible.
706.0,Provider,"Terrible yeah yeah absolutely um. And so, did you use anything when you were younger like a teenager did you drink, did you smoke marijuana or anything like that."
9549.0,Patient,"um maybe when I was younger I smoked a little bit of weed here and there, but not like say my dad was a heroin addict for. A long period of my life, and I was so against drugs so then like when I started dabbling and dabbling with opiates it surprised my whole family and then, when I got clean off heroin. I was so advocate about sobriety especially my sobriety and trying to get other people to get help, but then, when I got was my I guess he's my ex boyfriend now with Teddy. And I tried met they all hated Teddy they all blame Teddy for it because they said, I would have never even tried it, I was so gung Ho about sobriety. uh huh but I don't blame Teddy and I tell them all the time I don't that they can't blame Teddy for me, using I chose to do that and. They said I wouldn't went out seeking it had I not but I might have went out seeking something else had it not been that might have been out seeking heroin and here it's not hair when it's vital. it's killing people, and I could be dead."
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah it's it's very scary so heroin did you start with heroin or did you start with pills.
9549.0,Patient,"I started with percocet invited into this here and there, and then I moved to the west coast, with a job that I had called national chemical company and we traveled from Alaska to Washington to California. To Hawaii and we just walk the whole West Coast and it's hard to get it's hard to get pills out there. heroin and meth is what's there which I never did the math out there, but heroin was what was there and it was easy access in California and Hawaii and Alaska so I had to get heroin and that's where I started saying here."
706.0,Provider,"So when you weren't taking the pills, because you can't find them did you find yourself getting sick and going through withdrawal."
9549.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh yes so bad. Okay, so."
706.0,Provider,"You were you you resorted to taking heroin, so that you didn't feel stuck anymore."
9549.0,Patient,"yeah and I also said, I would never do it, and I did it and I said that's Okay, because i'll never use needles, I always just that by i'm just going to snort it. And then, it was i'm going to smoke it and it was i'm going to use a needle and shoot it i'm not going to do it in my vein i'm just going to do in my muscle and it went in my vein. i'm lucky, I never got had see like my sister she got her Betsy and heavy i'm lucky, I never did because it's like it's killing her right now, like her whole body is swollen. And she's younger than me and it's literally killing them two together, I guess is like a deadly combination. yeah it is."
706.0,Provider,"When you stop the heroin and you detox yourself, did you do any kind of treatment any kind of therapy or anything like that."
9549.0,Patient,"I went to church okay I lay in bed, I went to church is actually what made me want to get clean. Like was really a song two songs that I heard my cousin lj I used to use with him and he got clean and he got with. The preacher sister, and he used to sing at church and he sang this song called chain breaker by zach Williams and he's some song called give me a revelation and it was a revival and just. Like I don't know something spoke to me like I need to get clean I just shot up in the bathroom at church and I thought I would never do something like that, and I did, and I came out and he laid them to songs and it was like it wasn't even enough to get me hi I was still sick. Sorry. I was just taking I heard two songs and i'm like I told my mom I need to get clean makes you always assumed that I was using but she never been I go you're using. Because she's not that kind of mom and she should call the COPs on your quick, but she has called my yellow a couple of times you did go might be okay she thought I was using recently, and it was really because I went through something traumatic and the guys in jail for it now."
706.0,Provider,So. wow you have quite a story when you first started using pose was it just simply to get higher did you have an injury that caused you to start getting them.
9549.0,Patient,"know is because. My daughter's dad i've started, taking care of his daughter when she was two years old, she left her. Her mom left she had postpartum depression and I sit out in the living room and watch all them go in the bathroom we had a really big bathroom and they would have all kinds of fun be laughing and giggling I was sitting out there with a two year old. So i'm like heck I want to have fun to so I went to the bathroom to."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
9549.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"you're fine don't even worry about her, I have a two and a half year old, so I know exactly."

706.0,Provider,"My son takes off his clothes, the first chance, he gets all the way down to his diaper."
9549.0,Patient,"I didn't even. Think i'm so glad she's recently potty trained to the morning in the night. But then I got I got custody, I took care of my daughter's. My daughter's dad has two other kids he too well she's she's now 14 I started, taking care of her when she was to her mom was completely out of. bacon he got another girl. As doesn't learn and we got custody of her I got I got full custody of her until she's 18 years old, I got her from children services when she was three and I have her and she's the earliest one to be potty trained, the other ones, she had a step back when. The when I got custody of when she was three her mom got out of the halfway house a couple months ago. And we were living with my daughter's dad and she came there to live and she doesn't like holly I don't know why, or what it is about holly that she doesn't like she doesn't like her. And she had to step back and start peeing and pooping her pants and but she we love my daughter's that house. And she hasn't had a setback make sense you're going at my mom's house, even when I was in jail, she didn't hear pooper so any."

You had an appointment in one to wear panties and I tell you you're a baby if you wear a diaper your sisters don't wear a diaper you're wearing a diaper you're a baby and she's like i'm not a baby. And she just threw her diaper the way one day her whole packet neighbor she just picked up with them in the trash I left them there because i'm like all right she's ready if she's thrown in diapers way she's. ready, she was."

I was gonna go stay at my apartment when I was in jail somebody was saying, I didn't know somebody was staying there they were squatting and they destroyed the apartment so I had to go in and. Just replace a bunch of stuff in there and I was there, cleaning a there's a guy that used to mow our graph because I live in the country. And it was late, and I was walking I got in the car with him and he put something in my drink from taco bell and I don't remember much. Besides the next is screaming get out of my house and I had different clothes on and going to the hospital and going to the police station and he's dealing with that that put me to like a really bad about with depression recently any it."
706.0,Provider,Oh absolutely that's very traumatic um so you don't remember what happened.
9549.0,Patient,"I just know I remember talking to him, I remember telling him like I was walking to taco bell and it was late at night and. I had to eat or drink anything yet, because my daughter died like i'm not coming this late to get you, you should have caught earlier just you have this. You have to stay there tonight and taco bell is down the road, I was walking and. He drove past in a truck and I didn't know who it was because it was dark and then he drove past again and he said, my nickname which is. chandelier and only my family calls me that, so I turn so talking to me as I want to ride it birth, I was hesitant about it. But then I went ahead and took the right, and I remember I ordered a $5 box and taco bell and a Sprite. And then I went to the gas station, I remember him letting me out at my apartment and I was walking up the stairs and I seen him drive away. But I put everything down on my door and it took a couple of stuff inside and I come back out to get the rest and he was standing there. And I told him he couldn't be there and I smoked a cigarette and talk to him and I remember sitting on the couch and he was trying to get my boots and I told him don't do not touch my boots I, like my boots. next thing I remember, I had my back against the refrigerator and really short shorts on i've never seen before, and he was twirling and a shower curtain that I have hanging to. As a door in my bathroom and he was twirling and seeing that shower curtain and I was screaming get out whatever he gave me paralyzed my leg, I felt like I couldn't move my legs whatever he did, and everything was blurry besides him twirling not shower curtain."
706.0,Provider,and
9549.0,Patient,"I just I just went to the psych Ward over it like right after it happened, I went to the psych Ward and I went to jail."
706.0,Provider,yeah oh my gosh i'm so sorry that you had to go through that.
9549.0,Patient,"yeah I don't remember anything like I just didn't I was kicking the next morning I was driving in puking so hard. My uncle came in, because you're supposed to go to na meeting and he left my door open and I army called to my living room and I could hear my uncle saying why do you have a phone if you don't ever answer your phone because he took my phone my phone my wallet and my parties. Oh, my God I prepare my uncle I was trying to scream for my uncle. And he couldn't hear me, but he ended up opening the door, the rest away, and I was laying there, and he thought that I relapsed on heroin. So he was like we've got to find a needle and we got to find the drugs, we got to get rid of it for the COPs get here. And I was trying to tell him, but I just couldn't get it out and he kind of just figured it out after giving me some water he kind of just figured out what what had happened, and he took me to the hospital police station. Or the COPs actually came and talked to me at the hospital first and then we went to the police station."
706.0,Provider,Was there any evidence of rape or anything like.
9549.0,Patient,"That yeah well they got DNA samples, and they said that there was. aggressive scar tissue from penetration on both spots, the back in the front. And I was leading. Oh, my gosh yeah and they put me on antibiotics and anxiety medication, because I couldn't asleep and that's my mom made me go to the psych Ward and after directly after getting out of the psych Ward I had court, the next day, and when I went to jail. which, thank God, they give me my psych meds and my subs in jail cell because I probably wouldn't have been able to be in the. Building myself in there for real I don't feel that way now I don't feel that way now but, at the time and I felt so disgusting and so nasty. yeah i've never been to anything like that in my life ever."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh i'm so sorry, you had to go through that nobody. deserves to go through anything like that."
9549.0,Patient,"Well, I live in such a small town, like you, wouldn't think it there's actually two more girls in his trailer. That were from another state, and he convinced him to come up here they're like 1819 years old, he convinced him to come up here. And bought them a bus ticket come up here and they didn't know anybody, and he pretty much been drugging them and he got caught on a Monday well the Sunday before you would. Do one grow into the gas station with them and they were arguing, and she went to get out of the car and he put the truck and reverse and it hit her with the car door. And the COPs who already wasn't for him on a warrant so he ran but they end up finding him the next day, so he has three charges. Three three sex charges, they got him on a drug charges when they arrested him he had a warrant. For my charge, and then I talked to the other two girls, today you got to rest and. They went in and talk to him and then he got actually got bind it out on his drug charges, but instead my probation officer and some detectives were downstairs waiting for him to be released and they put them in handcuffs and put them in a book itself. which I just found out yesterday when I talked to my appeal that too is down there, and she said she is she is making sure that he is going to pay his time because she is like i've been working with her, for a long time so. My family real well and she said she's going to make sure that he gets the highest prosecution he could possibly get and he's sick he's very second ahead. my daughter."
706.0,Provider,"wow. that's a lot to do and you ended up going into the hospital, how long were you there just that one day."
9549.0,Patient,"yeah like I will I sat down and triage they don't have a regular triage they have like a triage at MED central, then they have a psych triage I was. I was in the site triage because I went kind of late, I was in the site triage overnight, and then I went up to the floor, and I was there overnight so it's actually like two days but yeah. I was only admitted for the one, though. And I told him I was like I don't I don't want to be here, I just want my medication, so I can sleep and. Like talk to the counter and get everything out that I need to get out. And then. I had to I had to go to court, so I signed myself out of the hospital. They didn't feel like I was very suicidal or anything anything crazy like that. Is anywhere able to stop me obviously from leaving if I was too far too far out of there. yeah absolutely."
706.0,Provider,"So you had said that you know break now you don't feel like it, but you know at that time you kind of felt kind of just dirty and you know kind of in a really bad place so were you having suicidal ideations at that time."
9549.0,Patient,"No, I wasn't thinking i'm gonna kill myself, I was just thinking how stupid, could I be I teach my kids not to get in a car with somebody how stupid, can I be to get in a car with somebody I don't even deserve to live, I can even learn to be a parent if i'm thinking like that, like. I don't know i'm saying like how come I couldn't stop him, but I don't I don't think I would necessarily killed myself I just felt like I didn't deserve to live at that time, I felt like such a masterpiece."
706.0,Provider,Okay. So um would you say that. Now you have any of those feelings.
9549.0,Patient,"No cuz i've been myself at first we're getting in the car and I still I still stay to myself, you shouldn't have gotten a car that stupid, but no he's nasty he's taken I know it wasn't my fault. I think he deserves to die, I think he deserves to die I don't think I do I think he does. And if I would ever get the chance to hurt him I would. Okay night I told my P O, and if I got a chance to ever be in that situation again with with that man, I would have killed him my mom was. Like if he didn't get arrested my mom was going to like my mom is the biggest Christian woman you ever meet in your life right stop it. And she's like she think she said she was going to go on a date and she was gonna be like you raise my daughter, she was gonna shoot in front of everybody can pick up girls, but she would just messed up in her head to because everything that went on to. This to stop that. Sorry. cuz he's abusive physically abusive three year old."
706.0,Provider,So i'm.
9549.0,Patient,So.
706.0,Provider,Would you say that you have homicidal ideation about him.
9549.0,Patient,"kind of maybe I mean if I got the chance, well, I wouldn't say that now, I will say if i'm in that situation again if I could replay that situation again. I would have done something I would have thought, better, and I would have done something to defend myself I would probably be in jail right now for killing him."
706.0,Provider,But he really. wanted his you are drugged.
9549.0,Patient,"No, but I don't know if I if I were ever."
706.0,Provider,a terrible situation like.
9549.0,Patient,That I like.
706.0,Provider,"I complete I completely understand. Like. I just want to understand that you know you were drugged and so really he were at his mercy there's really nothing you could have done. and obviously you didn't know that you were going to be drugged, I guess, the only thing that maybe you probably go over in your head is I should have never gone with them. You know yeah probably would you go over, but you know it doesn't matter if you go with somebody if you're nice to somebody they still have no right to druggie when review, you know, and I mean like there is no justification for that at all."
9549.0,Patient,"It came back PCA or something like that which I guess is like an antidepressant. and substance that I know in some sense was sent to something called lab core so we didn't. even talk to the detectives actually gotta go talk to him today, but I wouldn't say that i'm homicidal like I wouldn't i'm not to go kill somebody to kill somebody."
706.0,Provider,"you're not going to. search them out and kill him, but if."
9549.0,Patient,You know.
706.0,Provider,That situation. with him yeah and you would act differently.
9549.0,Patient,yeah okay that makes sense.
706.0,Provider,"I have, do you have a history of any self injurious behaviors like cutting our burning. No um are you currently taking any medications for your mental illness."
9549.0,Patient,"yeah they just put me on something and I actually missed my appointments, I was in jail for my refill on it. Okay, and I missed the group, so I couldn't talk to Isaiah about it. Okay, if i'm the bottle real quick, so I can tell you what it is. lorazepam 0.5 milligrams."
706.0,Provider,lorazepam so.
9549.0,Patient,yeah man junior advantages.
706.0,Provider,"anxiety, or you want anything for the bipolar."
9549.0,Patient,know. I probably need to be.
706.0,Provider,"yeah I would probably be a good idea. Especially with everything that you've had happen and. You know just kind of getting. Those chemicals know. After. I mean, because your your brains gone through heroin usage and methamphetamine usage. plus a lot of trauma, so it definitely would be beneficial for you to talk to Isaiah about getting on some medication for your bipolar since you are diagnosed with that typically bipolar or something that you do have to medicate."
9549.0,Patient,"yeah I do have pretty bad mood swings like my mom just told me yesterday that I need to get put on. medication or do something cuz i'm it's getting out of control, so this way I snap."
706.0,Provider,So yeah after we're done here go back to the vc. And says appointment with ice as soon as you can so that you.
9549.0,Patient,"can think. I think I have one scheduled for the seventh, I believe it is or something like that yeah. Okay, but that was for weight gainers but I was gonna bring that up to, I decided to try CBD from them it's not like the thc kind of CBD it's. Medical CBD that you can buy it like the gas station and stuff someone to try that to help me gain weight, because it doesn't make you eat it's like we would make it he. He makes he. was so Okay, because I did have an eating disorder, when I was younger. For ben's meetings I would benji I would take eat all winter long like a like a chipmunk I would eat all winter long snag all summer and I would only need a couple of times."
706.0,Provider,Okay okay. And that's when you were like a teenager.
9549.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"um do you have a family history of mental health, I know you said that your dad used heroin."

Except for her conviction, when she completed drug court her conviction was was off of her record, it was no longer on there. I didn't get treatment, a little conviction or drug court I got Community control so it's about the same thing, except. For my conviction will stay on my record in her statement so she was doing really good when she was in drug court.

So it's probably at least until everybody is more stable and their current recovery to just kind of keep away from each other, you know physically. But still maintain that good contact over the phone or you know via facetime or you know, whatever."
9549.0,Patient,"yeah I see her when my mom goes over there. So I every Sunday we go to church in the car after church where whenever, but because we all go to eat as a family after church. But she doesn't go and search she doesn't believe in God or whatever so she doesn't go to church and that's terribly if I pray for her, but I can't force them to believe in God, but she goes see with us every Sunday i'll see all the time, I see here."

I thought about it. Because that's kind of what he does now like still he. thinks he gets a call from a client, that is, and you think that it would happen very often but I couldn't believe how much it actually happened, where a client calls and like look. i'm not i'm out find the dog house and i'm going to get some dope and he'll he'll doesn't it doesn't matter what time of day, it is day or night hello to our kids in the car and he'll drive to the House and he'll talk them out of it and that's kind of like what he wants me to do."
706.0,Provider,"Okay okay. Well, I mean. If it's if that's something we have a passion for helping people I mean that's definitely something you can look into it is very challenging work, you know, and obviously you know from talking to him, you know."

706.0,Provider,yeah I haven't died.
9549.0,Patient,I am.

Definitely, I mean that's that's one thing, so you know our ends and i'll can say they have other nurses drives and they can do one care, but with everything else, they have to do like treatments and things like that. it's nice to have somebody specifically for that job so and that's good for you, because you know that's you know employment stability."

To get you, you know the charges that you've gotten and you know, having to leave your daughter to go to jail time on all of that, once all of that stuff resolves and you've kind of when you process it and then release it. That self esteem will start going up. And then you know other things that you can do to try and make it little boost says, every day, just write a list of things that you want to accomplish during the day and then check them off as you go and there's something about being able. feel accomplished that makes you feel better about yourself. yeah."
9549.0,Patient,"So I we kind of have a list a to do list of things we want to do, I never able to get them done it's like I always end up back in I started, and we can then I end up cleaning so. Oh, and."
706.0,Provider,"To rectify that and it sounds kind of silly but just doing like really simple things on your list to start the things you normally do like i'm going to wake up and i'm going to you know make my bed. or i'm gonna. Wake up and i'm going to cook my daughter breakfast. You know those kinds of things I normally would normally do just to get in that habit of I actually do accomplish things during the day. You know. It may not be the things that I have you know, want to accomplish but i'm actually accomplishing these things. And then, the more you do that. The more you'll feel like you can accomplish more and then you'll get to those other things on your list."
