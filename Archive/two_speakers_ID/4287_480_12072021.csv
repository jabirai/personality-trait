480.0,Provider,"Well, it kind of worked out well for you than."
4287.0,Patient,"It did it did, because I wanted to leave. The bed and breakfast but. Knowing how difficult it is to find employees right now it's going to be even more difficult to find someone to replace me. Right you're. going to do both but it's getting difficult. I did the clothes."
480.0,Provider,Are you able to like take days off from the bed and breakfast if you need to or Is that not an option.
4287.0,Patient,"Now I typically have to go in every day and cook breakfast for the guests. Oh, my gosh. yeah. get up I go and I cook breakfast for about 16 people, and then I do all the reservations in the office work and then I leave come home change and go to my other job. And then i'm usually not midnight. And is it do you have extended store hours, right now, or there's just that much to do after the store closes. That much to do after the store closes we have shipping, then we got to do, recovery and countdown tills."
480.0,Provider,"Is it always like this in retail, or is it just because it's the holidays."
4287.0,Patient,it's always like this and retail customers destroy the store. yeah you can have everything hanging nicely unfolded nicely and everything looks good and when we open in the morning within an hour it's all they they're just so disrespectful.
480.0,Provider,So irritating.
4287.0,Patient,It is irritating it's like you're on repeat.
480.0,Provider,yeah So do you enjoy. yeah.
4287.0,Patient,"And I, like everyone I work with and that makes a big difference."
480.0,Provider,yeah for sure. yeah in a mall or is it just a standalone store.
4287.0,Patient,it's in a mall at that outlet mall.
480.0,Provider,that's good and whatever happened with there was a job you were going to get that you had to like do training for.
4287.0,Patient,That was the swag I had turned that one down.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
4287.0,Patient,"yeah that one was going to be, which is crazy. When my husband was working I didn't have to work, I just wanted to work. So it was just. their money. So when I was offered that job my thought process, as was well now it's going to be probably 20 times more demanding i'll never be home to see the kids yeah so I turned on and then my husband gotten that wreck, and so it just. panned out the way it panned out, but now I wish I would have taken it, but you never know."
480.0,Provider,"I you could reach out again if, for some reason, your husband can't go back to work in the near future, would you be able to reach out to them and explain that and see if there's still an opportunity."
4287.0,Patient,"I mean, probably, but it makes anything they'll reach out to me they reached out to me like four times for for different positions."
480.0,Provider,I turned up. So at least you have options. What did you. normally do for work.
4287.0,Patient,"He worked for styling and distribution, he was one of their sales REPS."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so is he, like on leave or he just quit all together."
4287.0,Patient,"Oh, they said he can come back whenever he wants to, but I really don't think he should be driving. yeah with type one diabetes, I mean this wreck was because his sugar got real low yeah that's putting other people's lives in danger, as well as his own."
480.0,Provider,"And it's not a job that he could do from home, the majority of the time."
4287.0,Patient,"Oh, because he has to drive. Thought. So I told them. Really, if we could just get him on disability. That would be better, because I mean this is like his fifth wreck i'm surprised, they haven't taken his license away yet."
480.0,Provider,"And he could easily get on disability, for having type one diabetes right."
4287.0,Patient,"So, but he's already been denied once I think we're gonna have to get one of those so I don't really know what they're called I guess there they vouched for you, where they go to bat for you to get you your deal. it's like a disability attorney I guess."
480.0,Provider,"i've heard of them I don't really know what they do, but I have heard of them. Well, and I think, maybe if he does end up having neck surgery because of the accident that was caused by the diabetes like if you put all of that, on the disability form that might help his case a lot."
4287.0,Patient,"Oh, I did I."
480.0,Provider,Did already and it got denied. What yeah.
4287.0,Patient,"i'll deny you, the first time you apply from what i've been told, anyone who applies they deny you, the first time."
480.0,Provider,Do you think it's just because they expect people aren't going to keep trying.
4287.0,Patient,I guess I don't really know i'm new to it.
480.0,Provider,So messed up.
4287.0,Patient,It really is. It took my dad almost three years to get on disability and he had heart failure.
480.0,Provider,wow.
4287.0,Patient,"yeah he got disability and died like six months later. yeah. it's a pain in the butt the process, you have to go through. I don't know we'll figure it out. god's hands and let him take the wheel, because if I stress and worry about it it's just going to do nothing but make me sick."
480.0,Provider,Exactly and that's The thing is worrying about it is not going to change the outcome of what's happening.
4287.0,Patient,at exactly.
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4287.0,Patient,"I spent way too much of my life, stressing over things that could change. I just can't do it anymore yep. Absolutely only."
480.0,Provider,"Our holidays, to be stressful for you."
4287.0,Patient,"not usually this one is a little bit, but luckily, we have a good family."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's good.
4287.0,Patient,Our in laws typically by the kids quite a bit so we really don't have to worry too much.
480.0,Provider,that's helpful.
4287.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,Are you going to get to see your daughter at all.
4287.0,Patient,That will probably facetime her I think she's gonna go to my grandmother's house for Christmas.
480.0,Provider,"and your grandmother, also in Texas. that's right. yeah hey I thought you're doing you have a mom or a sister that lives by you. Know oh they're all in Texas still. hmm Who was it that lived by you, your best friend, maybe that you don't really talk anymore."
4287.0,Patient,"About JESSICA, the one that I cut off."
480.0,Provider,yeah the one that was using maybe that's what I was thinking.
4287.0,Patient,"That the month that I had met out here, and really close well I had stopped we started off, I was just babysitting her kids. And I kind of grew attached to the kids and then the her I kind of became friends and I suspected throughout our whole friendship that she used but I never saw it. No sumption but she would tell me, she was taking adderall and as why she was so uppity and I guess I could kind of see it, so I was like okay well, maybe that's what's going on, but then. We had went together to a vineyard like a winery pinner vineyard for the weekend, and it was just her me and her youngest daughter Kennedy. And then that weekend we drove back, we got to her house and she said she had invited us to stay over for dinner me and the kids and I said yes, she ran to the store to get what we would need for dinner. And she had Kennedy in her bedroom and jessica's bedroom watching cartoons well when a two year old is silent you."
480.0,Provider,Know it's worrisome.
4287.0,Patient,"So I went to check on Kennedy and she how it all played out she's gotten something to stand up on, and it had gotten jessica's dresser and she was on the bed with a mess pie, and in fact he yes, I was livid and shocked."
480.0,Provider,I didn't say new year old had a math pipe oh yeah.
4287.0,Patient,"To JESSICA that I went home and I wrote like a nine page letter and I gave it to her and it basically I didn't say anything ugly it was just i'd love you I unfortunately if you're not ready to get sober I can't continue to be friends, but if you are i'm here to help you through it. will backfire she got pissed off and started calling me all kinds of shit so I quit talking to you right well I just put my distance is what I did. right and it kind of worked out to that that's when I had just started working again. So I was able to kind of use my job as a reason why we weren't hanging out, but then it got to where she was like it's been a year and a half and we hardly see you, you can't just keep blaming it on work and. So, finally, I went off, and I was like Well, this is what's going on, this is why we can't be friends, I don't feel safe with my kids there I don't feel safe. You know stratton always wants to go spend the night, have never let him spend the night there ever even before I didn't let him spend the night I just did I knew in my gut. yeah you know what I mean, so it just got too. too difficult to manage her really."
480.0,Provider,affect.
4287.0,Patient,people that are bringing negative stuff into your life.
480.0,Provider,"mm hmm well and especially so for me I realized, I can handle addicts in my life if. they're trying to get better and they admit like I can't handle the ones that are in complete denial there's a big difference."
4287.0,Patient,"Exactly, and she could sit there like even being caught red handed her excuse was that it wasn't hard as it was chad's which is kennedy's bad. And he doesn't even live with her, and I said what difference does it make it for two years or chad's it was in your House where two year old was able to get it."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's a problem.
4287.0,Patient,"And I told her I said, my dad was an addict my whole life I know the signs. You can't buy."
480.0,Provider,Exactly.
4287.0,Patient,"And she still wouldn't deny it, so I just had, I just Could I just couldn't keep on with her."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm so how long has it been since you've talked to her.
4287.0,Patient,About a year yeah.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
4287.0,Patient,"She contacted me actually about a month ago. And I can't even remember. Oh, I had done her taxes, last year, and she had messaged me asking me why she got less back than what. They said she would get back and I had to explain to her that the child tax credit. You didn't get the whole file tax credit you're getting it in monthly payments. So that's why. And then she started on this rant about that's bullshit that the child tax credit should have been on the return that the money coming monthly is like a coven something and i'm like JESSICA check your facts i'm not gonna sit here and argue with you."
480.0,Provider,it's not like you're the irs that's making these rules.
4287.0,Patient,"And I told her I said i'm not going to sit here and argue nonsense with you because you are obviously set firm and what you believe I did so, you call the irs and figure it out for yourself i'm too busy."
480.0,Provider,good for you.
4287.0,Patient,And stuff but they they come up with stupid stuff addicts do.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah all the time.
4287.0,Patient,or exaggerated tenfold.
480.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah. I think the biggest thing. Especially because you grew up with a parent who's an addict is the lying is more triggering than the using itself.
4287.0,Patient,yeah exactly. Exactly the line that hiding that.
480.0,Provider,"The constantly arguing about everything being defensive about everything yeah that's hard to put up with. Exactly that's when I get most. triggered in groups are when it because to me it's like I get it, I was an addict I did all those same behaviors and at the same time it's really hard because. i'm a parent you're a parent it's very childish behavior when addicts are acting out and so it's like having a whole group of adults who are acting like children get so frustrated."
4287.0,Patient,"writing because it's like you know, especially with my sisters, we sat there and watched my dad struggle with addiction, or I it was like walking on eggshells in our household and. For me. My outlook on it was always oh my God he's teaching me everything, not to do. So. Did I completely avoided that road in life, and my sisters followed it, so it was just how ignorant, can you be you sat there and watched it firsthand. You want to happen, look at dad that's what's going to happen, and then the end its death, so why would you choose to go down that road, I guess, they have to learn for themselves, eventually, they did but."
480.0,Provider,No they're both clean and sober now.
4287.0,Patient,"here's I mean they just went through. I would guess, I would call it a phase when they were like in their young where they dabbled and and would my son, one of them became a stripper and kind of got into it pretty heavy for about a year. Something that lasted any longer than about a year to thankfully."
480.0,Provider,wow that's really fortunate that all three of you are. yeah 18 that's rare when you have a parent that's an addict.
4287.0,Patient,"I know I know. i'm so that that played a huge role in that. You know my mom and my dad got together when they were 1617 so they were really young when they got together and my mom I guess eventually saw that you know it's fun to party for a little bit, but it's time to grow up at some point."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4287.0,Patient,So she went to nursing school and fought her way through nursing school so that she could leave him because she couldn't afford to raise this on her own. yeah so eventually she was able to leave after she got her nursing degree and we lived with her. But l she was a really good mom but dad. If he would have just got sober I think they would have still been together. He would probably still be alive. yeah but.
480.0,Provider,it's crazy to think about.
4287.0,Patient,It really it. really is crazy.
480.0,Provider,And he said it's been like three years since he died.
4287.0,Patient,No my dad died in 2007.
480.0,Provider,Oh wow okay.
4287.0,Patient,A long time ago. hey there's only seven years older than I am now when he died.
480.0,Provider,Oh that's scary to think about.
4287.0,Patient,Oh it's coming up.
480.0,Provider,Well that'll be exciting when you hit the birthday aster. that's crazy.
4287.0,Patient,It is crazy.
480.0,Provider,wow so um as far as bright heart and like therapy stuff do you have any specific goals you want to work on in therapy.
4287.0,Patient,"i'm. not really I know this sounds so stupid, but I feel like i've mentally have a good grasp on LIFE I mean I don't. I don't really I don't know what to focus on, I tried to not focus on too much I just tried to put one foot in front of the other."
480.0,Provider,"yeah, which is good because that's kind of like. The whole goal of therapy is getting people to focus on present moment, instead of past future is like just one foot in front of the other keep doing the next right thing and. Eventually, like as long as you're someone who knows how to process feelings, as they come up which you do, then living in the present is kind of the key to everything."
4287.0,Patient,You have to because I can't I can't change what has already happened and I can't change what will be. No i'll. Do is focus on me and now at the at this.
480.0,Provider,"Good. Okay, so January appointment i'm going to put it in the calendar, so we make sure we have one um you want me to do Tuesday again."
4287.0,Patient,yeah that works.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I will do, let me I don't even have my paper planner runs out in December and i'm like."
4287.0,Patient,straight up my new one.

4287.0,Patient,30 bucks I went to rite aid and I found a planner for 999 I was so surprised.
480.0,Provider,And it was a good right.
4287.0,Patient,"yeah it was a big one, or I guess it's now a walgreens it's not a rite aid anymore, but. It was one of the big players with where the calendar boxes are large."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I, like those."
4287.0,Patient,"Oh, I know I know, and it was only 999 I was so surprised I bought two of them. I got one for me and one for miss Karen."
480.0,Provider,Was awesome yeah because those are like 40 bucks on Amazon for the big ones.
4287.0,Patient,I know they're super expensive.
480.0,Provider,"that's crazy Okay, so if I am adding an employment oh my gosh what is happening with this computer. i'm. Okay, so we. wow there's a lot of people that have your name in our system. Really okay so today's in January, we have the fourth. The 11th the 18th or the 20."

My kids bus comes at like 640 so it's an early morning, and then I have one in middle school, so I have to do the carpool and then I come home and have my morning nap well this morning. Right after I got home from a bus stop it was like 10 minutes till seven my cat was just going crazy, and so I was playing with her and she scratched the tip of my nose and a."
4287.0,Patient,tiny bit.
480.0,Provider,"It bled for two hours like. Oh ripping block for two hours, so I didn't get my morning nap today because I was pouring out blah."
4287.0,Patient,Oh wow that sucks though i've got to have my morning nap on my days off. I have to. Because any other day i'll take him to school and it soon as I dropped him off i'd go into the bed and breakfast but all my days off I take him to school and then I come home and I lay down and I go back to sleep.

480.0,Provider,"Know normally when I mean I switched to fake trees, because. Three years in a row I got these beautiful giant real trees and they died before Christmas, so like. open in the ornaments would fall off and one year, the whole. frickin tree fell over I was like no real trends anymore."
4287.0,Patient,"we'll see now, we have two cats so keeping the cats out of the tree has been difficult."
