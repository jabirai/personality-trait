13830.0,Patient,hi.
298.0,Provider,How are you.
13830.0,Patient,"i'm okay my stomach hurts a little bit, but i'm all right."
298.0,Provider,Do you know what that's from.
13830.0,Patient,"I think i'm acid reflux, I think, and like a digestion issues from anxiety, I guess, sometimes when I eat certain things like I just had like a. Fight thing like a whole grain snack and I think that there's a little too much fiber at once, or something I don't know."
298.0,Provider,Okay it's very possible. yeah It could be that.
13830.0,Patient,"But i've been pretty stressed out this week, because in in college I forget where you live, but I live in modesto California and the wildfires are like. Not far and it makes this hazy sunshine thing and really I don't know why I like it, it really triggers my kind of existential anxiety like feelings, like the it's not the daytime sort of like I like to go outside in the morning and like. sort of align myself with what time it is and it's the morning now and now it's getting darker because otherwise I just can't keep track I work from home, and I really don't like when it doesn't look like the day outside. Especially because it's only the last few months, where it's not going to be cold again and I just have been feeling upset about that it kind of scares me."
298.0,Provider,"And it's harder to get vitamin D, I think. Oh it's a lot harder to get vitamin D and. yeah we don't i'm in northern northern California and we don't have the fires this year because we've been having big time grain and that's. Thank you, thank you, thank you yeah."
13830.0,Patient,"yeah that's good I hate rain, though, because they can't go for a."
298.0,Provider,walk that's the.
13830.0,Patient,"problem like I really use that as a tool for my mental health is like going on a walk. So I just end I have bad allergies and stuff I don't have like respiratory issues, but I get freaked out about the air pollution and I like wear a mask outside, but I just get very. it's pretty bad out there, right now, so. it's not as bad as last year, but."
298.0,Provider,yeah last year was really bad it really messed me up when I was. Young one day and I went outside and it was orange and hazy.
13830.0,Patient,"And i'm like yeah I mean it was like a night that really freaked me. out, and I think it kind of reminds me of that because I was like still drinking then and kind of with the ability, with my abilify and it just wasn't good and. It felt like the world was ending I thought I felt like I was gonna die and it just like I didn't like that you know. yeah I think even for someone not experiencing that it was just a scary time."
298.0,Provider,It. Definitely is.
13830.0,Patient,So it kind of it's kind of been triggering some some anxiety that i'm trying to work through because it sort of interrupted my routine of going outside in the morning or taking long walks they don't feel i'm afraid i'll aggravate allergies or something so i'm trying to figure out. different ways and like sitting outside with a mask instead of taking a long walk or so i've been feeling a little trapped and gross but. Overall i'm i'm not so so where I didn't start I didn't take the lamictal.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
13830.0,Patient,"I just I just felt I just. i'm doing better now, but I still don't I feel like a little bit they're still raw and I just don't want to deal with side effects like that beginning side effects the I just don't think I can handle it right now Okay, you know. that's maybe there wouldn't be but. You know."
298.0,Provider,"Well, we need to get to it. You know, further along from that are you taking your other medications."
13830.0,Patient,i'm taking lexapro. Okay yeah.
298.0,Provider,And what about trotted out for sleep.
13830.0,Patient,"translate on I still haven't tried I should try because i've been sleeping okay i've been following like. there's some nights where I have bad like dust my allergies so get really issue but I started taking anti histamines at night and during the day, so that I fall asleep some it's pretty rare that I can't fall asleep within an hour. So I just haven't I haven't been taking the transit don't really."
298.0,Provider,Okay. And what about I remember a sense of wasn't and I see a pen so.
13830.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i've taken so I took that. um i've taken occasionally, I guess, I took the think of like. Last one of them, because it doesn't feel like I took because you gave me like sick I feel like one of them. You know, if you like, put it in one of those things, and if sometimes it will just dissolve it'll just turn into a crumble think that happened with like two of them, and so, then I did so i've taken it, I guess, like four times. Four or five times, but if the problem I mean like it does help me like when I was emailing you I was having really bad race to the point where I couldn't sleep, but the problem is, I think what happens whatever way it processes in my body, it seems to give me like. i'll have that first talk get kind of like a little disoriented like so calm, but a little bit like. Confusion feel like a little bit like. Right wait I forgot what I was doing and then it'll give me kind of a euphoria because i'll be so anxious that i'll get kind of happy, you know that I feel like oh my God I wish I felt like this, all the time. And I also feel that there's kind of a after glow effect for the next few days, I know that's more likely with like a klonopin or something, but even with the advent, I feel that I get it sort of 10 and it could just be a placebo or."
298.0,Provider,Due to something else.
13830.0,Patient,"But i'll feel very kind of euphoric and. A little out of character from a like very comfortable in social setting for like a couple days and then crash from that and sort of have like a. A swell of anxiety for a couple days and I don't know if it because I have anxiety over time, anyway, so I don't know if that's exactly what it is, but. So I don't. I try not to you because the past couple times i've found that to our past few times I found that to happen every time we're a be oh my God, this is, I i'm able to do this, I made, I was like working better and and then, just like crazy anxiety and crying and like. sort of. come down or come down, I think, from it. And I don't I don't know if it was from that but anyway, I still have like five of the last one you gave me and i'm just the only time I would use the now is if I really was like not able asleep or something but. I like the way it feels until it makes me until I seem to sort of."
298.0,Provider,freaked out.
13830.0,Patient,"yeah rebound from an or just be so disappointed it's gone, because I, you know I want to feel that. That. sort of smooth all the time, but it's just not realistic."
298.0,Provider,So. What I hear you taking is you're taking the lexapro it five milligrams.
13830.0,Patient,Correct uh huh.
298.0,Provider,"And that's, the only thing and that's a really small dose can you. Yes, notice it working at that level."
13830.0,Patient,"I think I mean I think i'm still better than when I what I was before I started take lexapro. I know that and my family has commented on that. I think may be. Is there any way, we could go to seven house or is it just 10."
298.0,Provider,"it's 1010 minutes, the next level."
13830.0,Patient,But I couldn't do five and a half five.
298.0,Provider,yeah you could because.
13830.0,Patient,you'd have. wary of yeah.
298.0,Provider,I know you are I know you're. um let's give it let's see if you can cut the tablet and calf. And do you and a half tablets a day and see how you respond.
13830.0,Patient,"yeah I think that would be good, because I am getting anxious i'm or and I also have been feeling depressed I think. For the first time in a while I think i've sort of leveling off the because I know it's a small dose, but it has been effective, I think it did. kind of like i've been working again like I don't even know if I like I started I make YouTube videos and I hadn't for like a year and I did, for the first time oops like two months ago. And I made i've made to so far and i'm doing other things online and i'm like productive more productive and so shown seeing friends or a couple friends and stuff. that's fine. But i'm kind of the past, like week or two i've been going back to sort of like waking up and going back to sleep and then watching TV all day you know. Which is usually what my depression looks like there's a lot of napping and just sort of consuming media."
298.0,Provider,"yeah. All right, true, I put that to a tablet and a half, is there anything else, I can do for you today."
13830.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so I will email you how it goes with the tablet and a half, so there isn't a 2.5 strange pill."
298.0,Provider,Around five is the lowest.
13830.0,Patient,"Is there, like a different because those are so tiny, but all I think I can split them."
298.0,Provider,"yeah it'll be a bit of a challenge for sure. Okay, but maybe we'll get to that the 10 in a couple."
13830.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
298.0,Provider,All right.
13830.0,Patient,Take care of children. I met you thanks.
