14204.0,Patient,"yeah I think so because I mean it kind of works, but I still feel like."
298.0,Provider,"yeah it's not enough. And I get it, you can go up to 40 milligrams, and I mean we're just inching our way up. And so we're not there yet and i'm not saying that these are the only two things, you know that are out there, the work but we've got to try it and we've got to try it to the dosage that I know should work okay. how's the weather down there are you guys getting rain like we are."
14204.0,Patient,"No, no rain it's just today it's starting to cool off feels actually really nice so."
298.0,Provider,"Like all. Right, how are you sleeping."
14204.0,Patient,i'm not very well. Probably about the same.
298.0,Provider,"same when you started. So that's something that. You know, is an option of doing a medication to help you sleep at night it's up to you. This the starting thing that you usually start with in tears is you start with trezza down, which is an antidepressant and if people can go to sleep on that, then all the better because it's not addictive and that kind of thing. And then, if that doesn't work we go higher and higher. Do you want to try a couple tries to Downs for sleep, or what are your thoughts."
14204.0,Patient,I can't remember if i've tried that one there was one that I was on before. That worked pretty well but. I can't remember the name.
298.0,Provider,De de you want to try to find out the name. Or do you.
14204.0,Patient,"I try, I think I could try that again just."
298.0,Provider,"Okay i'll just do like 10 pills, and if it doesn't work it doesn't work if take. A half a tablet to see if that's enough. You know if it's too much if you wake up groggy okay Okay, it was too much it and if one tablet is not enough at 50 milligrams. People go as high as 300 milligrams so take two tablets if it's not you know it's what it takes to get you to sleep when you need it so you don't have to take this every night. And so it's there i'm writing i'm all i'm writing the proposal and the trezza down prn. and hopefully that'll you know. Hopefully it's one that works for you, I don't know till we try okay. um how have your mood spin."
