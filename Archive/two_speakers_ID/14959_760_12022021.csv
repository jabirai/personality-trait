Have you have you. thought about that anymore, or do you want to tell me what you think that might be, or do you want me just to tell you."
14959.0,Patient,So those who are search like alicia. Silverstone. To get a subpoena for can imagine there is no. logical. She says she has been thinking about it and. She was. Wanting to go like practice with you.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right um mercy, I can say to you mindfulness is a practice it's like a lifestyle. it's not something that you learn like right now. um. So it's a concept of being here presence are. probably going to need some translation with your husband, because these words might in English it's a process of being present here in the moment right now. you're not thinking about. you're not thinking about the."
14959.0,Patient,"Future that is. right here, right now, okay."
760.0,Provider,And it's also a process of. letting go of.
14959.0,Patient,Dr.
760.0,Provider,"Including judgment of yourself others or even just the situation. mindfulness can include. meditation. Have you ever tried meditation. Okay. Well um let's try let's try a couple of activities of mindfulness you. were sitting in a car, so that means your kids are safe and contained in their car seats i'm assuming. yeah so maybe this would be a good time to practice some mindfulness maybe a little meditation is that going to be okay sitting there in the car for you. yeah yeah."
14959.0,Patient,alright.
760.0,Provider,So.
14959.0,Patient,Okay let's do it.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's see here in the car, we can do this let's do this one with the eyes open. So it's important your posture how you sit you don't want to you don't want to sit like this, you want to have your. your shoulders back that you don't want them like uncomfortable you want to back your spine your back should be straight your feet should be flat on the on the floor of the car there. You can put your arms, just like rest them in your lap. And then. Then, taking a deep breath in through the nose. feeling the stomach expand. And then you can exhale through the mouth. breathing in through the nose. And out through the mouth. and through the nose. And out through the mouth. Now we're going to take a minute and we're going to notice what's going on around us and perhaps your, you will notice the i'm assuming your telephone or your device that you're on this zoom meeting with me on. going to notice the you may pay attention to the background that I have behind me, you may pay attention to maybe what i'm wearing or maybe you might look outside and see what the what the neighborhood where your cars sitting noticing that the sun is is almost down and it's it's. And just noticing everything pay attention to the way your body feels the way your your your way the seat feels as you sit on it. The temperature in your car, you have the heater on or maybe the air conditioning feel feel the temperature notice any sensations that are happening right now. And then you again remembering to be in the present moment. Sometimes you might find that your thoughts start to drift you think maybe you think of something you wish, you had done different before or maybe something that you have to do in the future, and I want you to visualize putting that thought. On maybe blowing bubbles, and you send that thought into that bubble, and you watch it as it floats away, and then there was both. And just use your imagination. Remembering to breathe in through the nose. And out through the mouth. and tell me mercy what are some of the things you see around you right now. Nothing no wrong answer. Just, whatever your I lands on."
14959.0,Patient,Our apartment James and. The fountains and then so many trees trees.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, the leaves on the tree. yeah okay. Okay."
14959.0,Patient,And my husband.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, what continue to breathe in. And out. Oh. And then you notice that your your child there in the back needed something, and you got a little concerned, so you turn and that's okay. we're being in the moment. Okay, tell me how was how is that feel."
14959.0,Patient,She said. it's helping her to relax but thoughts keep creeping. yeah the fact that he's sitting in the back is. Also. distracting her so she's so she we just under the cboe so we'll see. Hopefully.
760.0,Provider,"it's it's normal mercy hi there. it's normal for your thoughts to wonder. I think most human beings, we we struggle with mindfulness is hard for us where we are thinking about the past or the future a lot. But then when we're practicing mindfulness we're letting go of judgment and and if your son needs something, then you okay i'm going to take that time i'm going to be mindful in the moment that i'm giving me attention my son I don't have to judge that. That becomes part of the process, because that's what's happening in the moment and I know what being a mother is very important to you and being you know attentive to your son. is very important to you and there's nothing wrong with that, so we just kind of bring that in a little bit. of it, you know if you wanted to do more of a meditation where you're going to close your eyes, then that would be something that would probably best be practice in your morning ritual or. Or perhaps when they go to bed your kids go to bed. You could do it then to maybe right before you sleep. there's another. there's another exercise in mindfulness that we could practice, and this is good anytime your anxiety level hits like at a six or maybe higher. So what and i'll just model it for you will i'll do it, and then you can copy me after we're done and if I need to slow down because of the translation. Just kind of raise your hand and i'll stop so your husband can translate that will. we're going to bring. we're going to be mindful of the communication and we're going to allow that translation to be part of the process in this moment, as you and I communicate together sound good. yeah Okay, so this is called 54321. So i'm going to name five things that I see, and the first thing I see is mercy's beautiful face and her. and her Green shirts and her car and the dust. And the seat that she's sitting on. Then i'm going to think about four things that I hear. And I feel I hear your son fidgeting a little bit I hear the sound of my own voice, I hear a slight ECHO through the through the zoom settings and I hear my little dog at my feet playing with his like frenchie toy. Things that I smell. So maybe the two things that I smell. It was just kind of hard right now, because I don't really smell anything right now so maybe i'll just be in the moment with that and i'm going to accept the fact that I only smell one thing and that's just normal air. And then, what I taste, is just. I kind of taste my lunch, a little bit still. Okay, did you get all of that. yeah Okay, so this, so this is something you can use to like turn down the dial to to turn down the anxiety slightly if it's if the time you know you don't really need it, but let's practice, it just to just to do it, you want to go next."
14959.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Five things use five things you see which you kind of already did but let's do it again.
14959.0,Patient,I see you. You and your eyeglass.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14959.0,Patient,Your background and.
760.0,Provider,dreaming mm hmm.
14959.0,Patient,I see it's a parking what shy parking sign.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14959.0,Patient,I see my face.
760.0,Provider,but also your face in the screen okay all right good and for things you here. Oh.
14959.0,Patient,I hear my. My son internal. Moving in in the car. And then he and I hear again he's trying to breathe in and breathe out.
760.0,Provider,New years and breathing.
14959.0,Patient,yeah I hear the car voices outside. mm hmm driving cars and. I hear my voice.
760.0,Provider,Okay okay um and what was. um smell.
14959.0,Patient,My son has.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay. Okay it's kind of hard to smell some anything else, sometimes when that happens yeah. yeah perhaps you smell this you wear a diaper so."
14959.0,Patient,No.
760.0,Provider,"No, it doesn't okay okay all right um and so tastes now one thing."
14959.0,Patient,She she drank tea just before we started the zoom. chase some of that.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, I see your hot tea."
14959.0,Patient,it's a hot tea.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay okay So there we go so that's that's that's mindfulness now mindfulness is like I said it's a practice, and so, if you want to build it in your life you're going to try. To use these kinds of exercises maybe starting the day with meditation even if it's like even only five or 10 minutes. And then you can move on to maybe your journaling or you're reading at the same time. And then throughout the day you're going to slow down and be mindful of your tasks, you can do this when you are may perhaps you're doing chores so when you're doing the laundry, for instance you're going to think about every step of what i'm doing. To be in the moment like instead of thinking okay I gotta put this in the wife. And then I gotta go wash the dishes and all I better go check my son, you know how them, especially when you're a mom I know that goes like that, so you know as long as your son is safe, you know. You know you always want to give priority to that, but when you're doing a task try to be in the moment of the task, be in the moment when i'm when i'm separating my clothes, because i'm going to put them in the wash be mindful of how you poured the so all of that. And just kind of slow down with that. Does that make sense. And I mean and and and again don't forget the concept of non judgmental because sometimes people will you know oh my gosh I forgot to be mindful and then they judge themselves because they forgot. And that's it's just it's a practice because you're not going to be perfect at it, it takes time to build and you know kind of. be conscious of that. Does that make sense."
14959.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so I hope that helps. um so you haven't been dealing with anxiety, everything is getting much better for you. yeah okay. Okay, so what are some of the other things that you've been doing to care for yourself."
14959.0,Patient,Buying some treatment for her hair. to set up an appointment with the hairstylist. and Financial stuff I don't know.
760.0,Provider,"Okay female stuff. Okay, all right all right so you're doing much better with that and so tell me what it is you like, what are you getting adjusted to and your new home environment, what do you like about your new home can you talk about that a little bit."

760.0,Provider,"Okay 10 so 11 to seven okay so that's that's some good sleep, then. yeah okay so you're doing good, because I think you had reported previously that you had insomnia, so that's no longer a problem or hasn't been a problem."
14959.0,Patient,Right now.
760.0,Provider,Okay well mindfulness is a technique that can help you sleep if it if it should become a problem again. But i'm glad to hear that you're getting good sleep and seems like you've made. Some progress and so last time we spoke so that's wonderful. Okay. So is there anything else happening for you that you want to talk about is there any other concerns or questions or issues so anytime.

760.0,Provider,"Okay, so talk to me about. talk to me about that do you think you were avoiding the gym because you didn't feel like going to the gym or did it just the the tasks of being a mom or the other responsibilities just. keep you from going."
14959.0,Patient,"more mature, yet not tennis tomorrow conductor tricky. slump but just to. give you another calm down. On my direct line, it seems. So she said she decided not to go to the gym because I was off and she wanted to."
760.0,Provider,spend more.
14959.0,Patient,"As a family together. Okay, but at the same time she feels like she can't stick to her. You know, Jim schedule okay you can't. be consistent, so that bothers that bothered."
760.0,Provider,"Is that is that because other because you made a choice you choose you only have so many you can be in two places at once. So, you made a choice which is a valuable choice to spend time with family, which is important because you know your son is going to continue to get older. Things are going to change and it's important that you guys take this time for family to be together so when, can you commit to go to the gym perhaps tomorrow or. or. Can you talk to me about that."
14959.0,Patient,"Because it. made more sense yeah. bunch. Of really. Sorry. transmit coast, a. Meeting. In a couple more clarity and focus. On beta we're going back. To. The NASA give grandma letters and. So. Even if she. You know, did it for a valid reason she feels like. She failed in not making a commitment to go to the gym.

760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14959.0,Patient,"Tomorrow, but she will not the fact that she missed. Today, will still I call Center or bother."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then this is this kind of leads to another topic um. Working on one's thoughts. letting go of. letting go of judgment so kind of, I guess, we could focus on that part because that sounds like a judgmental thoughts towards self i'm being hard, because you did make. You know I think you're happy with the choice you seems like you had a good day. you're in some level you're happy there's some part of US happy with the choice, but the other part, is not. So how. You know, working on our thinking and the self talk and. The things the habits that we say to ourselves, you can you can kind of correct that in your own mind and say to yourself i'm happy that I spent time. Just kind of when you're feeling that, when you're thinking that thought about feeling guilt, you can correct that in your own thoughts and say i'm happy i'm happy that I spent time with my family, I will commit to going to the gym tomorrow and just correct that. And, and you can say you can use an affirmation I let go of judgment. i'm going to let go of this judgment because i'm happy that I made this thought and just kind of correct it. With with improving yourself top. That sounds like a topic that we could talk about next time a little bit maybe some affirmations do you think you have a. Do you think you're hard on yourself and some of the time or a lot of the time."
14959.0,Patient,"sure. Sometimes yeah. No i'm sorry yeah he. She says, some of the time."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so some of the time, half of the time, less than half of the time."
14959.0,Patient,mush mush mush mush. mush channel. Less. Less than half the time.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so okay that's not too bad, but still, it still sounds like something you would like to improve not being hard on yourself."
14959.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Okay okay so. One thing to one other thing that you could do is just to. Practice some affirmations. Do you know what I may probably need to that word affirmations did we talk about that last time.
14959.0,Patient,"Know an awesome. Is. teacher. swim. We, we did not discuss that last time."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right. Okay, well, I would encourage you to the other thing that you can do to add, is to say something I am a strong healthy women. Who takes care of myself. And you know when the judgment comes up into your head that's all you can just kind of repeat that, like over and over again, over and over again. And and correct that. OK OK, and then, then when we do make mistakes, you know, maybe, maybe, sometimes I didn't go to the gym because I didn't feel like going to the gym then Okay, you know I made a mistake. i'll do better tomorrow. Okay um and just you know watch the way you, you talk to yourself and and i'll make a note let's talk a little bit more about. thinking and thought thought habits is one thing that I like to talk about we can talk about thought habits and and how that affects our emotions and work on that a little bit next time does that sound good."
14959.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, but you're doing so much better you seems like you, you you've come a long way. And you're getting adjusted to your new home and that's great. Okay What was it was nice seeing you again mercy."
