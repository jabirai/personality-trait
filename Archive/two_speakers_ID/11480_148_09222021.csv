I don't like what my parents ski so it's like not really new it's like more kinda on me so i'm starving all either.

148.0,Provider,wonder rewind a little bit because we're touching on a lot of different things um are you okay with losing this friend that was so important to you.
11480.0,Patient,I will be. The last. one.
148.0,Provider,"What happened, how did that come about."
11480.0,Patient,"um. it's like it's my decision really that we're not friends, because. I didn't think that that that person would ever do that. I don't want to cry i'm not a praying person. You know that. you're like aren't really physical with me and I was like yeah that's no. And he really knows me really like literally like the back of my head, so I was like a volt people I didn't think like that one. Okay people come and go, they really do and I. Physical how like i'm he was like hitting me. yeah, but I am there i'm a very defensive person, except for in the moment in the moment, you know how there's like flight or or with fight or flight or freeze I do the third and least common I just can't move."
148.0,Provider,"So, how did you get out of that situation to where you."
11480.0,Patient,"Are I, like my brain I just like can I use my legs when I fight. These, I really strong legs and, like, I was in karate kid and they said you don't use your legs like your legs, are going to be the strongest part of you, and we were in the car, so I just put my back against the door and like. kicked him off. And you see where weighs the same as me it's just proportion differently it's very tall like very, very skinny he doesn't have any muscle, so I just like kicked him off, but it was literally it was kind of my no I wouldn't i'm looking since my phone is i'm a girl so. But I like I didn't hit him first that's the thing I know myself, and I know my dad has told me this when I was like the first time, he told him was 10 years old, and he was like brielle. You can't fight people, and this is why, because you can actually do serious she's like I know you have that, like a drill. he's like it doesn't matter how big you are it's because you know how to fight. So don't and I was like okay fair enough, so I was kind of that was like comfort to me is like oh i'm small and I can take care of myself, I really do so. I like to kick them off me um but yeah it wasn't my fault, I took a jar literally just like a jar of nothing, and I was like hey. Can I take this because you have like a bunch of my shit I used to keep a lot of my stuff at his house, because it didn't fit in my room and, like my parents would throw it away, I had a giant teddy bear them my energy my mom threw away. But then I found another one like at a garage sale, so I was like yes, I kept it at his house now, it has to be my room, but now I have like. No room to be in there, but he's Okay, and just one of my stuff back so I was like okay well, this will be like insurance. Now I know i'll get myself back that way have like one thing of years because I don't have anything to lose any and just like was like no like grabbed my hand started hitting me, and so I just like kicked him off me and then he tried he tried to like. restrain me from like hitting but I was like know what i'm not even kidding you just like. You know, and like the whole entire time i'm not all I can admit i'm not always a calm person, especially when i'm having moments. But I was being so incredibly called that like I was surprising myself, because I was just like I had no energy I had been working all week. i've been exhausted I needed food, I had no energy and I was freezing me like walk home from his house so, but then he's like very I think it's bipolar and I think you need to diagnose for at least something so I know he's at least depressed but he, like won't go see a therapist. I don't know I like his parents are also like go see a therapist let's let's figure this out let's do this and i'm like. he's the boy version of me if I can do it like you can do it once I do, that every it's not that bad you can do it too he's like oh God. or a house and i'm like okay it's not a therapist, though, like a person is to therapists then qualify. and"

As a cyber park like directly across the street from my house so just kind of like disappeared into the field. Right and I was like looking for my stuff I, like my didn't know where my phone was like God from in that, so I was like looking for that I didn't have a flash likes. To call my phone I remember, I have one of my keys so i'm like looking for it, and my dad comes out to his car that's like perfect for it's like go. get some of his work stuff or put it away something like that I don't know and i'm like dad and my dad's like what like Tony I was like Brian attacked me and he was like yo no I was like yeah but it's like.

Like what."
148.0,Provider,The influence of anything.
11480.0,Patient,What.
148.0,Provider,"With the under the influence of anything. No, you guys."
11480.0,Patient,"Usually that's, the only thing he does, that I know because, like any smokes a little more reason makes now i'm like not really like just barely but. We got sober together and we were like staying sober together, and it was really easy to be so, where we had some like literally doing it with me, so I was like oh like. I don't even friends, I have one right here, I don't need like you know I don't need that stupid fun of like going to San Francisco at 3am with I don't even know who I don't that's not fun, this is fun, but now I like having friends, by making friends at work. But it was super cool perspective, how many friends, I have in that too. So I like I didn't think about that."
148.0,Provider,And I haven't.
11480.0,Patient,"What how many likes going to group last night put into perspective, like how many people because, like that's a huge group of people just in general. yeah and then like the fact that a lot of all of them are like incredible human beings and like extremely nice people makes it a lot better. And I was like wait, I have a lot of friends. I have, like all these. And I didn't like think about that, when I was like Oh, I have no friends."
148.0,Provider,yeah you have for.
11480.0,Patient,"lunch, a couple days ago and. It was like her last day here, but we were like really good friends in high school and my ex boyfriend that like completely broke my heart i'm a little better now. Like completely broke my heart, like i'm I haven't dated or like even talked looked at boys in three years i'm good with that so. She like introduced me to him, like back when that happened in high school but yeah her, and I really good friends and him and I are like mutual friends. We have a lot of the same friends so it's just like it's like no hard feelings like we see each other we're friends without without okay um so her and I were talking and she knows brian's we're talking about that. and her and I are kind of similar place like we're just want to. Like it's kind of good that we don't have any friends, because that will be forced to focus on ourselves and i've liked as much as i've said that i've been doing that and really haven't done."
148.0,Provider,"Well, and it definitely opens you up to making new friends that are. more conducive to the growth that you're working on and and you're covering right. Have you had any contact with Brian since that night."
11480.0,Patient,"i'm like a little bit key like apologize and stuff okay. here's like brian's a really nice guy like he really is, I know him he living about you like, he has this huge love for like people in general. And when any one of his friends is like hey I need something he's like i'm here and there, through him a bear doesn't matter you need something i'm here. And he's always been like that and that's why we're so smart I love helping people I didn't know that about myself but i've recently learned that and I like it it's like interesting yeah so. He apologized and stuff and I was like i'm not really there yet, but he's like that's fine, I just wanted you to know that, like i'm sorry and like I didn't need it, I just like he has anger issues like we like we're so. mentally similar, and I think that's why we, like a lot we fight like brother and sister like a married couple, like all the time, but. yeah he was like I didn't he's like really didn't mean that I think I just like snapped and he's like and I don't know why it did he was also just like I said I was really called and he just kept yelling at me and being like need and so just like."
148.0,Provider,"I think that's where you know. His temper it because some scaring action right where you wouldn't want to be in a situation where you don't feel safe, and so I think it's important on your part, to really consider that and take the space that you need from him I. Know you're doing the right thing by that also, I just wanted to give you space to talk about it today, just because you've talked about him so much and how."
11480.0,Patient,"Important yeah. And it's okay to cry it's Okay, the you know to feel the emotions coming up and just allow yourself some time to heal and maybe. I cry a lot like you really do just by myself, I like hate crime in front of people it's so stupid, I feel like."
148.0,Provider,"Well it's very healing bry it's really, really actually you know a good thing for you a really good coping tool for you to heal and allow."
11480.0,Patient,yourself to receive this.

148.0,Provider,make you weak. It just makes you man.
11480.0,Patient,"i'm like laughing will have my pride. yeah so he apologized and. We like talked a little bit cuz I blocked him, so I was like I don't know, I was like I know that's Okay, no worries um. But then I like unblocked him because I wanted, I really wanted my stuff back, and I was like can you at least like do that, can you please at least, just like drop it off, I live two minutes away from you. wheeze and he was like yeah okay like what tell me what you want, and I was like when you need, like all of all of it he's like I don't know what all of it is. And then he was like while we're talking he's like i'm sorry I didn't mean that all I like was trying to do. we're kind of in the same like mental spot he in his life, he said at first, he was like I think that we are too dependent on each other. And he's like in the past, like five days or five days that like i've been by myself he's like i've realized that like i'm not okay without you and that's normal. He was like I like like I love you so much that I can't be so dependent on you and I just need to like and I was like no that's where i'm like."
148.0,Provider,And you have even brought that up and session before you know around how that would affect him and and yeah I think it's really important to think about yourself first right.
11480.0,Patient,I agree.
148.0,Provider,"surround yourself with. People and safe people for you, I mean I."
11480.0,Patient,"Though. Like I literally my new people don't live here, they all live in like la or Oregon and that's why I want to move that's like either or. But because, like to have my really, really good best friends. actually met them one of them's you Brian it's friends other best friend, but like brian's like. I taught me like talked about that, and he was like it's Okay, I know you guys are close I know we're close we have separate like friendships with one person it's okay and i'm like okay that's good so like at least we can like have some of the same friends without. That so. yeah that's what I want to move, but I just got a job."
148.0,Provider,"Right, so you need a job."
11480.0,Patient,What.
148.0,Provider,You have to save up to be able to. move right.
11480.0,Patient,"Exactly so i'm like I know I know. But my my job also knows that one of the managers told me she's like not like a head manager, but she's like up there she's manager. And she's really cute her name is Nicole she's really speech is a kid who's like 14 or 15 but she literally I kid you not she looks like she herself could be 14 or 15. I didn't think she was like much older than me when I first met her and she's like golly my daughter is homecoming tonight and i'm like. wow OK, I was like you so good, by the way, and she was like I saw like i'm like no. yeah so she was like breathe like support knows like we know that you are long term you're going to be a long term worker. yeah she was like we know that you like, have always wanted to be here and that you really love being here, so your long term and she's like just so you know, even if you don't want to do this anymore, there are so many different like doors through the forest for is owned by. So, like she's like yeah people have started here and did up there. Okay that's why like we we have so much like do your and. Why so I all those high high high end so, so I am just like wow that is so cool so then on long term and like theoretically you could get transferred into like a different place. You know. Since that's what I should do I should go to school, though not like school school, but like he's. fission yeah because i've wanted to do that, but I was like I don't have time, but my work literally pays, though, like reimburse your tuition if you're going to get licensed."
148.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11480.0,Patient,"And like that's. take advantage of the technology or aesthetician because I offer a lot of like skincare as well so far as now. Is fragrance hair hair makeup and skincare mainly make up into here, so I didn't even know that I thought I was just makeup but it's so interesting that I love skincare because I have to care for my skin so i'd like to love to love for it."
148.0,Provider,would be such an amazing thing to take advantage of.
11480.0,Patient,"Because it's like now that i'm not really. Like when i'm not at work i'm just like here, which is fine, because i've been exhausted so i've, just like the days I have off like today, I just didn't like sleeping and laying in bed and relaxing because it really is exhausting but. it's really fun, I really love my job."
148.0,Provider,and your full time right.
11480.0,Patient,"Oh i'm sorry. yeah but they know she liked that when she told me, she was like yeah they know you're going to be here long term So if you ever want like more hours we are super like good and flexible about that So if you want more hours they'll give them to if you want to be full time in it. So i'm like oh."
148.0,Provider,yeah we're.
11480.0,Patient,gonna have that option.
148.0,Provider,"That must feel really, really good."
11480.0,Patient,yeah I love it. I really like.
148.0,Provider,"It I know you were feeling some anxiety around starting and learning and training, so how is that going."
11480.0,Patient,"Okay, so training technically I haven't even finished my training since we're so short and then they literally like me. And I didn't know that I would be this good at my job. But, like all of the managers like daily tell me they're just like bry you have learned so much in a week. One me. And they're like you, are literally doing so good, like so they have like a closing email whenever you like close. And like I call i've closed a lot, because we wants to close and I knew fine by me I paid my dues, you know so i'm like it's okay I don't live and I actually I like like. Cleaning not my room if it's not my room I like to clean, I like to take out the trash or wipe down counters like it talks about I loved. wiping down on the counters and like cleaning because I would just get to listen to the music and like dance right so that's what I do it's a hora it's like fine. And then, like taking out the trash is like really fun, because what over ladies are like let's get a box cutter to like you know crush all the boxes and I just like. Step on them really hard and like yeah one time, I was wearing a dress like I did that, and one of my managers was like she's older name is Helen she released. Her kids like went to the same school as me and they were in one of the charity leads that I was in so really cool actually um and she she she was like Oh, my goodness, like. In a sport and I was just like shorts on fine yeah I like it, I, like my job was, as I wasn't sitting with."
148.0,Provider,US and i'm so happy for you.
11480.0,Patient,"yeah I really like it oh yeah and the closing email the managers have to write like an email so Okay, we got so to usually two people close. And it's a manager and then like a beauty advisor that's what I am that's like the lowest but then there's like licensed beauty advisor which is higher up that's what i'm like aiming for. I just get licensed I like the state so going to beauty school um and we only have one right, so they are like really encouraging me. So I should do that so anyway um and then the manager has to write like the closing email in the office, while the other person like Queens because it's like a long thing so and then we got hit. On it wasn't my fault. But I did get a little in trouble, because so basically getting hate is when someone steals a lot, so a pregnant lady and her friend came in on my lunch, so I wasn't there, but I was supposed to be there and I didn't know that I. yeah they had a talk with me about time already, but the lady who I was talking with me was like free I was just like you like. I am terrible at time management and I got to like the furthest point where they write you up and you literally can't mess up anything or it's. So she was like I got to that point and I now i'm a manager she's like now i'm this store manager. And she's like and I don't want you to get to that point this isn't even the first point, this is just a little talk so if I was back not said it could have been avoided, but people are less inclined to steal they see more of us around."
148.0,Provider,With the lunch break did you stay um.
11480.0,Patient,"I don't remember, I really don't remember, but she said that I was in the back. And I was just like in my Walker like doing something like you know I i'm imagining getting chapstick and stuff like that, because that's what I do. And she was like it wasn't for long, but it was just like a couple Minutes that you could have been out there and I was like i'm so so so so sorry she was like just set a timer for like five minutes before and I was like oh wait that's a really good idea."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11480.0,Patient,"It looks really, really nice she like comes from like she's like I wanted to talk to you because I feel like you're the person that wants everything to be 100% transparent and i'm like yes. I mean. It was like that's why we just wanted to talk to you about it yeah so someone stole over $700 worth of stuff which is like a lot. and Another like. Another manager was more at fault, because she was supposed to be in that zone but she wasn't. So, like understandable, but like it's also hard, like, for me, I forget when clients come up to me and her like where's this i'm like oh i'll show you, we have to say hey can I leave my zone to help apply it or someone available to help. You know, but I want those clients because that's more emissions for me. So i'm like I got like. i've been there one week and I got my first like cross sale so that's when if a person comes in for specifically makeup. And you get them to buy like skincare as well or hair care as well, or all three as well, so that's when we call it like cross world. And then baskets are like you know what the client like wants and like has like a little shopping basket, so I bought my first someone came in for makeup and I was like do you need to make remover and she was like actually I do and I was like yes i'm learning. So I didn't know, I was good at sales, but my parents are professional sales people, and I think i'm pretty persuasive. So that's been like fun and I was like I got my first like crossword backstage and whenever we like get something like that we like call it out into the microphone the all the light workers have, and then we like write it down so that you can get Commission it's so cool I love it."
148.0,Provider,"i'm asking for sounds like you're doing, really, really good."
11480.0,Patient,"With that it's just like one of. The only thing that i've like been kind of stressed out about because, like I know it's good that Brian and I need timely. To ourselves us he's right, we are very dependent on each other, and it is not healthy like we are as dependent as like a married couple. That has no one else but we're not even like like that so it's like very unhealthy, I understand that and I do know that in like the friend that lives in La was like bry. I am encouraging you to take this time away from Brian not a huge he's like I need I want you. To hear about yourself a lot more, and I was like okay fair enough and he's like there's no pity there's only love and I was like. harsh but understandable, you know, like that's what I need to hear because tough love, how it works for you, I guess, so. Anyway, so when I worked, I like don't think about Brian at all because i'm like where i'm like busy on my lunch break, I would like call Brian and be like hey. mama lunch what's up dude and we were like talking on the phone the whole time or like you'd be like yeah like oh you're on your lunch like i'll come visit you all bring you so much, and i'm like Oh, that we would like hang out so now i'm just like. Okay, because then I didn't like focus on eating and my health. Oh, I think I need one of those like. You don't know what they're called but the little pill containers that has like Sunday Monday, Tuesday I need those because I carry like eight pill bottles around and it's like bad I just. I feel like. I feel like the meds that tanya is giving me the anxiety meds are not working. like the ones are fine."
148.0,Provider,When fear next follow up with her.
11480.0,Patient,"Like a month, a couple weeks, I want to say."
148.0,Provider,Okay let's definitely be sure to let her know and keep her posted on how. you're feeling about what you're taking.
11480.0,Patient,"I keep telling her, but she just keeps like telling me to like show he, like increasing. Okay, and she's like yeah it's like a slow acting like you know."
148.0,Provider,"he'll work with you, and you know."
11480.0,Patient,Sometimes it takes like.
148.0,Provider,yeah she's awesome.
11480.0,Patient,"she's really nice and like. Every literally every time I talked to her, she like there's me so many compliments and it like makes me feel really. Obviously, talking like like I do I talk a lot about like things that makes sense to me. yeah things that make sense to me don't make sense to a lot of people that's why I like to share it, because then it's like perspective. i'm learning that perspective is a really interesting from fun thing so every time I talk she's like free you are just so wise every time I talk to you, I think this girl cannot be younger than 40. And i'm like yeah. I just think. Life is so simple but we make it so complicated and things are literally so symbol, if you just forget the complications if that makes sense. Like time is a construct, but time is also the only way to like heal us, you know, because time is the only system. Like the any consistent i've said it a million times the inconsistency is what is consistent about life and that's what makes it. What so like I that's what I keep telling myself about right like that was consistent, this is inconsistent and that's what makes this life that's what makes this people are going to be like that people are going to come into my life and they're going to come out of my life and like."
