705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13885.0,Patient,"I can't do a lot of exciting stuff like skiing or. boat boating because I don't have much money right now i'm going to limited budgets so kindle reading articles on the Internet walking it's all stuff I can do for either free or for very little you know i'd love to go skiing or go, you know skating or more. On a tight budget, you know."
705.0,Provider,Right you. know your resources and what you can do that's a little bit.
13885.0,Patient,"Cheaper no I mean no offense if I were low with money, I will be going to bright heart health i'd private my own private trunk like some those Hollywood people."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, you know, I think that. For right now it's like you're working with what you have right."
13885.0,Patient,"yeah and. So far, it's working out okay now I think i've got the technology curve that navigated you know i'm getting better at that. Good and i'm. To December and it's like i'm hope i'm i'm. i'm i'm an old dog, and I hope I can still learn some new tricks, you know and."
705.0,Provider,"Oh Apps absolutely robbery. No, I think anything that you set your sights on that you can make happen."
13885.0,Patient,"Right and I, like most of people in the group I go to on Fridays look like they're millennials 2030s you know I know i'm kind of the oldest guy who probably but you know and. They might be better with the technology, you know but man, you know, maybe have more money to spend on better Internet connections better cell phones, computers, but i'll do with trying to the best with what I got you know."
705.0,Provider,"I know, last time to we taught us, you were saying that with the media that maybe you're going to limit some of the news because sometimes it gets to you is that still the case."
13885.0,Patient,"That, I think, maybe not just too much media, but I think it's knowing who to trust you know. I know in group, one of the members of saying, she didn't want to be running that people there's people that won't get vaccinated it's like I don't. approve them not getting vaccinated or think it's a good smarter endorse it, but I can sense why they don't trust the doctors, they don't trust the pharmacy companies, you know I can i'm not saying, I agree with them not getting the shots. i'm saying, I can see why they don't why they're they're lacking trust you know and the I think I told you, patience and trust to kind of make two goals if I can't master at least get better at you know."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Right, so you know for. let's say what the trust. Is it rubber and you're like I call it your inner circle in your inner circle, do you have trust with those closest to you."
13885.0,Patient,"Yes, and now it's like everybody's got hidden agendas, but it's like i'm laying on my step cousin and even though. My he's been my step cousin for decades it's like I just moved to California couple years going to lie things and changed but it's like my a lot of people have died, my life and they all died before they turned 50 or 60 they all kind of died young my you know and. Right now, my social system small because about lived everybody about live my mother now about with my mother, you know i've outlived two dogs have outlived I think. I may not want to cousin in the same family, you know and then all these people died on us and 50 you know when. My best friend would would have been my brother in law, he died recently, and you know i'm just saying. I think the lack of trust, because I everybody's dying on me i'm getting more work and I never got married or have kids and my brother died before he could have any kids you know it's like. i'm kind of been withdrawn i'm kind of into like an own little i've been. My own little insular world you know because, like I said I can't talk to dead people it's like I don't really have younger people to carry the torch for me so. I might want to do i'm just saying, maybe volunteer work or going i'm just saying there's a way to meet people but i'm saying people my family and my friends pretty much died off, you know."
705.0,Provider,Right Robert and i'm hearing you know you've had a lot of loss and so that makes sense of where you began to lose some trust and like you said you know that maybe with volunteering that could be a place where maybe the trust is a little bit greater at something like volunteering. At an animal shelter or something like that.
13885.0,Patient,"But it's like when you're out even if you don't have close friends or family just having a job. i'm going to not going to school, you know we get around people it's like you know. I don't it's like you know you get your social contact during the day it's like you know you don't have a job or you don't go to school, I mean walking scrape and i'm by myself. And you know I mean I got the nature, I got people walking with me, I say hi to but i'm just saying it's not doesn't require as much contact you know. Like some people saying a long time ago, you might remember might be too young, there was a military draft, and some people say one good thing that drafted is that helped bring people together from different backgrounds and they'd be friends for life, you know. Wars and good the people dying in the works i'm good i'm just in the camaraderie that. The military brought people from all over the nation different religions different. ethnic backgrounds even you know brought peace help bring people will normally be afraid of each other, I know and you'll be each other, you know. Because we were forced into an invite a close environment, you know through boot camp and military big family good friends, because they have learned about each other's. Not just each each other's bad things, but the good things to you know right like that old saying to I mean a lot of people brag on be friends with the devil they know them be with an angel they just met you know."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I know, robbery have really you know were your takeaways and then the way that you're able to see. things sometimes to that maybe others don't see that part like you described with the draft about how yeah it can be something that's more positive, it can also have that negative, but to. write, but overall it was that you know that friendships that last a lifetime."
13885.0,Patient,"Right so i'm guessing I grew up in a small family I had one sibling. Mother in law, my classmates. their parents were older they have like five or six siblings somebody or even in grade school phone number, they have nieces and nephews because their families are so big you know my. Father and five siblings in his family, so you know, I was born after the big baby boom i'm a late bloomer early extra whichever friends, whichever customer you want to put me on you know. i'm just saying you know I have small family and and. Whereas other people, you know they'll do you watch a wall and it's like there we weren't just seven of them, but seven kids are like 30 aunts and uncles and cousins do like the waltons mountain or only little Community my dad had a. group in a farming family slash Community like 30 relevant at all work together and kind of form, like little Community you know."
705.0,Provider,For a.
13885.0,Patient,"Farm they probably grew grew a lot of food together they were homeschooled or went to one like those old one room schools, I went to high school with my graduating class had 650 classmates that's how big it was."
705.0,Provider,You know and bow Robert mine had 40.
13885.0,Patient,Words you graduate.
705.0,Provider,"I graduated in Texas. In a small town. vendor Hall, and it was 40 people and you had 600."
13885.0,Patient,"yeah well my I was in Northwest Pennsylvania town called arry like Reno too big to be a small too big to be a small town not big enough to be a major metropolis like 100,000 like Reno or. Maybe so."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13885.0,Patient,"that's my phone in the background, I got it it's my general physician I gotta find my lab is it or not."
705.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, do you need to answer it Robert."
13885.0,Patient,I let I let the machine Paco Brock I said yes either I got it or I did.
705.0,Provider,yeah. Robert house asleep in.
13885.0,Patient,"Not too good I gotta be honest i've been having trouble, although I either. I just to to math to remedies one is um. One is either one is um. PR interest and own I got that in my step mom gave me like an over the counter sleeper and when I take those I sleep better I don't sleep longer, but I think I hit go to sleep quicker and then i'm I am. Then, after that I am once again, then I wake up better the sleep is not too long, and I think it's a better quality of sleep, you know and."
705.0,Provider,i'll cry but your step mom has the.
13885.0,Patient,"Transit on and so other tracks don't with for me, but my step mom gave me the over the counter."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I got it okay."
13885.0,Patient,"Here it is, I think it's called i'm male melatonin."
705.0,Provider,Oh OK.
13885.0,Patient,"And you felt over the towel. And he. has been working What did the one time, I took that I know they say a lot of times, even though the county should get in the habit of take them, the more prn fake when you think you need them, you know."
705.0,Provider,Right and then just be sure to let your prescriber know you know sentelle to know that you're taking the melatonin just as needed.
13885.0,Patient,Right okay.
705.0,Provider,"yeah but that's good Robert that you're already fully aware of that yeah if you use it all the time they say, especially with melatonin then it may lose you know some of the benefits and so you're using it sparingly."
13885.0,Patient,"But it's also to in the past, I go to psychiatry if they gave me this heavy duty medicine would make like abilify I felt like it's choking couldn't swallow food. navin and how old I remember, I was shaking I sleep 16 hours a day, can barely talk. i'm just going to the md doctors, give me this heavy duty knockout medication it's like. I there's no way I could do an 18 mile walk on that."
705.0,Provider,"Now. me, you know you're right Robert with the side effects is definitely finding the medication that works best for you and you're you're not missing out sleeping all the time and not being able to do your walks. yeah yeah."
13885.0,Patient,"cuz i'm guessing and got all these years, no psychiatric medication i'm i'm functioning but, like the sleeping could be better, I mean i'm eating not i'm not eating that well but. Not such a lack of empathy but i'm on a tight budget a lot of pasta, because I can afford it, you know. My system, I can buy ball. East it's easy it's inexpensive easy to prepare and it fills you up you know. True, get a box of pause for $1 heated up mix some butter and, at last, you know couple meal chenault. you're like."
705.0,Provider,"Oh go ahead, Robert."
13885.0,Patient,You go like burger King mcdonald's you pay 10 bucks for a combo regular combo you don't get much and you're still hungry anyway.
705.0,Provider,"very true, and then the nutritional value is pretty limited where. Exactly, yes, usually a lot better."
13885.0,Patient,"It fills you up and it makes you overweight, it makes you know makes you tired Doc good for you good but not good for you."
705.0,Provider,"very, very, very true absolutely well, I know that you know, then you're looking again at your budget and then you're being able to still eat three meals, a day and making that happen."
13885.0,Patient,"My step mom strong to get me on to abt but not no I don't that's something I can look into I might make too much money for that. Beginning K without edt but like with the reversing my pen my nose your penalty, even if I kill the radio got $25 a month abt that's $25 I could put my car and fuel or something else you know. Right bonnie's."
705.0,Provider,"Right now, are you making any other income."
13885.0,Patient,"Well, I guess we're in for my step cousin and I got ssd I they said i'm going to get a cola in January, but some of that might be offset by my crease and medicare be up to see how that plays out, you know and."
705.0,Provider,"Okay well what they need it, I mean it's something that's it that's, for you know when you need it and it wouldn't it would be worth maybe checking into because that would be nice, even if it's 20 like you said $25 for food."
13885.0,Patient,"One Member my mom yeah my mom I remember my mom to give me tea, but she went to a mental health clinic and the mental health worker. i'm suggest that you get the ebit so she gets stretched or budget, you know fisheries on disability to."
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
13885.0,Patient,"And she had met with multiple illnesses, you know rheumatoid arthritis very limited mobility, you know needed a walk or you know, had a blue plaque or married married she can walk around but it's like. You need assistance limited mobility and some like when I had grocery giveaway downstairs you need me or somebody to go down and get it, you know and."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13885.0,Patient,very limited mobility and.
705.0,Provider,"yeah there's also to some time the churches do on certain days of the month, like a food bank where you can come in some products."
13885.0,Patient,"I never used those but I took a friend their depth and he that he was low and can I take my friend and I had a car, and he go in and get Nice. drive them around to the places so yeah he could get it stuff I mean, I think I made too much money at that time, anyway, but it could help him out, you know and."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you could you could check Robert if you're if you qualify, and you know, sometimes too if you're looking for volunteer work they're always looking for good people to help, and now you know, sometimes the food boxes and stuff like that, if that's something that you're."
13885.0,Patient,"Interested I probably do the animal shelter, because I like walking the dogs, you know. dogs are totally dependent on me being you know they can't do anything on their own and."
705.0,Provider,Right and you've had years of experience. I think that something like that seems like it's right up your alley.
13885.0,Patient,"that's i'm I have to look into, I guess, I guess, they wanted to commit to like six months in a hobby or training session to where you have to learn. learn the ropes you know learn how to you know, like to make sure the dogs don't get loose probably how to handle the dogs how far can walk them where you know there's REG rules and regulations, like anything in life, you know but."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, but it's you know I think again, Robert you've come from how many years of experience of being a dog owner."
13885.0,Patient,"While I see I had my first one, I think, from 9908 then add another one for like two years, so do the math about 10 more than 10 years share."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah so you have more than 10 years of experience, so I think you are. Absolutely qualified if if that's you know something of interest."
13885.0,Patient,"blessington plus i'm happy dogs that might be. hypersensitive they probably tell me how how to not get bit by a dog or some dogs mafi muzzled, you know and."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I know it see you are you're already ahead of the game where you already know about that, and how it is."
13885.0,Patient,"Like yeah. Well, some people may have never had a pet. cared for a pet in their life, you know right, I mean i've had been around pets as a child my parents would take care of those pets, you know for 10 years i've been the primary care caregiver for the pet you know and. And, plus the last. year ago last fourth of July, my mom died I inherited or cats and i'm learning, I give take care of a cat you know I had to take the I had to because I use my mom's fed, it was like a 10 mile ride the Batman my cat one of those transporter cages, and he wasn't very happy about that."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, cats usually do not like to go to the that are really anywhere outside of the."
13885.0,Patient,"Light yeah. yeah yeah I don't need a transport case for my dog, but for cats. almost any cat you'd probably need those cages otherwise i'll just. run away or running around the car."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I know to Robert and we've talked a little bit too about that there's been a lot of loss, and I know you miss your family members is there ever a time that you know, like in the last couple of weeks or beyond where you've had any thoughts about any self harm."
13885.0,Patient,"Wonka say swallow things i'm getting to the age where now i'm not making a dime and probably gonna die within the next couple decades i'm just gonna i'm gonna die but it's like. I think the thoughts are there, but the plan and heart in the law, the enthusiasm, the planning it's it's more of a wide effort, and it is my do you know I mean. I stopped with your thing because i'm every day, when you get older you get no matter who you are the order to get the close yard and dying it's like you know. When you're 20 you know, think of dying, I mean if you die in your 20s it's a fluke usually but i'm just saying i'm closing it on 60 where death. it's probably right around the corner it's like you start to worry about things like if I die if somebody's gonna get stuck paying for my funeral on. By dying dead or who's going to be my my somebody can be response my dad you know it's like funeral planning to on and be cremated buried or just do I care if they just throw my body in the landfill one just let it decompose that type of thing you know."
705.0,Provider,"160, though, is is now like 16 young 16."
13885.0,Patient,Right in today's standards. I mean that's what. you're right today 60 is probably would it be like. 40. yeah yeah I mean people are living longer now there's more people live to be 100 I guess come centenarians I think you know and Bob hope live to be 100 George burns live to be 100 on. Jimmy carter's closing in on 100 you know and.
705.0,Provider,Right.
13885.0,Patient,"I think him and I think in him in him and Bush and trump and Obama Ian and reagan's dead and think the older Bush is dead so yeah people are living longer me, and when you do 100 not even that rare nowadays."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, so that means rubber that you have you know, like everyone kind of thinks about Okay, especially like you were saying, as you get older we start to worry about the the care once we we die and we're like okay who's going to do what. yeah also to is just like we have a lot more life to live."
13885.0,Patient,"Well yeah i'm just saying I could still die getting hit by a bus or struck by lightning or get killed my son maniac with a gun i'm just saying I try and do what I. Can to stay alive and be functional not be a burden on my family or on the system, you know but it's like I could be unfortunate to but um you know. But it's also fact that you know you wonder, we think about having and how reincarnations like what's gonna happen when I die it's like we're told there's little lake of fire happy cloud but it's like that's all they can tell us anecdotal you know it's like. there's no eternal zillow it's you know realtors take go to painstaking way. lengths to make sure you don't get the wrong neighbors the wrong school the wrong in you know, to make sure realtors jobs, make sure all the demographic pieces fall into place, you know and with the after life, how do you do that, you know and."
705.0,Provider,"what's your belief, because everyone has."
13885.0,Patient,"done I don't know that's my whole said i'm an agnostic i'm not really an atheist, I think there might be a God, but i'm just saying. If there was a God in my in my playing the game right it's like you know is God passive aggressive just got that bad hair days it's like it's got mad at me I wore green shirt instead of a red shirt or update a big MAC on a lamp Friday and that type of thing you know. i'm just saying i'm not saying there is no God i'm just saying it's kind of us trying to. cozy up to you don't pose the up too much because sometimes we all do things we think we're doing them right we really truly think we're doing the right thing. we've done, but he tells us who knows better older more experienced more education they tell us we're doing it wrong, and then we discovered, they were right, you know. it's you know it's that old saying ignorance is not really a bad thing ignorance just means you don't know when a lot, you know when you're born you don't know you don't know anything at all it's like. You learn as you get older ignorance, you know mean is not knowing you want to learn more but, for one thing, some people. are entitled to learn more than others are some people can't afford to go to college, some people have their politicians or religious leaders, they have they can learn more because they have all these security clearances and they have lawyers to keep things secret for them, you know. Which means sometimes it's like what what goes on in the world it's none of my business what goes on in the world that i'm supposed to be responsible for you know. You want to be a Good Samaritan but you. can't be you can't be a peeping Tom neither it's like yeah you're expected to help your neighbors happen, sometimes your neighbors may not want your help and you think they do, but they don't you know when."
705.0,Provider,"Well, you learn as you go along and. Your neighbors and you learn others, and you know even with belief systems is sometimes people's belief systems change and everyone has the right to to change and believe in what they want to, and sometimes it's a it's not just one belief it's a little bit of everything."
13885.0,Patient,"But I mean it's the whole thing with the Novak thing is people don't want to get shot because they really believe this micro chips in the in the in the in the in the. injection they really believe that big farm it's a big pharma just lying about the virus to make my i'm just saying. we've gotten, to the point where we don't trust people we normally won't trust in the past, you know we don't trust our religious leaders yeah. Catholic priests mormon bishops get caught playing with children that's something you would never heard about 50 years ago and i'm saying it didn't happen i'm just saying it would never got out, you know who would have if it did, who would have known you know."
705.0,Provider,Right and now that we have more social media or coverage more right yeah. Video people or maybe getting more exposed.
13885.0,Patient,Part of the key harder to keep the quiet quiet yes.
705.0,Provider,Okay well you know to Robert I think last time to We talked a little bit of all even self care is showering and all that other stuff just doing the daily routine how's that going.
13885.0,Patient,"Robin is good, it should be like shower three times a week I mean if I had a job went to school, whatever i'd be showering and. I call it SOS shower or one shave and I do, that every day, if I had a job want this or even had a wife and kids and you know but i'm just saying, because i'm all alone. don't have social activity, I can slide on my hygiene, a little bit more than you know somebody who's got more more around people all the time, you know and. that's one thing if I did the volunteer work went to school or did something might be around people I probably more motivated to do all the hygiene and i'm not doing on a regular basis, you know."
705.0,Provider,"How sometimes to you know, like we were saying definitely if you're going to be doing things and then sometimes you know people will say, well, I feel a little bit better a little lift in the mood if I even take a nice warm shower on a colder morning."
13885.0,Patient,"Okay. Oh yeah that's right that can be therapeutic you're right yeah yeah. it's not you feel better right that helps mode can motivate you, and if you just want to do white stuff you know, or you know. But you know, like I said and. it likes, I buy if I had a full time job I thought, maybe i'd sleep eight hours a day, be tired from work, you know but it's all in just saying everything's hypothetical and yet you know."
705.0,Provider,"And you're you're at a different to face of where you're trying to see like what's next and adjust your schedule and then, once you find out the I know Robert you're talking about. Maybe volunteering and if that happens, then you would probably adjust your schedule and something would be maybe more routine."
13885.0,Patient,"Yes, but i'm just saying I picked up the stuff I did when I end up when I was younger when when I did go to school, had a job. More family members know I. pick up I guess you're saying pick up where I left off, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Well, whoever it is you know there's so much out there today where you can volunteer or there's different courses there's a lot of really either free or pretty low cost for some of the College courses or Community versus the places offer."
13885.0,Patient,"But one thing I think that holds you back is because i'm disabled I got to be careful not to be too energetic because I don't want to draw I don't want to draw attention and get an audit and find out that somebody. Challenging maybe thinking i'm defrauding the system or the malingering you know I mean I, we have a mental health disability. you're more likely to be audited or people are more likely to suspect that you don't really need social ssd I you know, and I mean i'm just saying if somebody's curious to me i'll tell them talk to my doctor talk, you know. Tell right i've been approved free ssd is like if i'm you know I think i've been telling the truth it's not like a fake demographer shoes and it's like you know you don't doubt my illness i'm. i'm this i've had people professional people say that mental illness and you can, if you want to talk to the doctors and it's like you think i'm wasting your tax money Eric think i'm cheating the system tell tell ask why did the doctors approved me it's you know and. I mean if you're if you're blind or broke missing limb it's all wheelchair then it's obvious you know. Like I don't qualify for a blue placard my car and, in all honesty I don't need one you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah but i'm glad Robert that you know to that with your doctors absolutely it's recorded it's there and how long you know you've been on SSI for how long.
13885.0,Patient,"Will often on I think back in Pennsylvania, I think I was on it for like a couple years and we're about to go on general welfare, because I was young and didn't have any work for kiss rate in mid quarter, so I guess that's how they go. reminds work periods I didn't have any of those. Then out here, I think it got disability or like 1990 and. Then I think between 90 and 95 I work part time Swami keep some of my disability, and so my medical benefits and and 95 we're going to full time job. and benefits, which means I didn't get a disability or medicare medical place I worked for provided everything and then in 2000 I was like go. And then I had to go year on state disability and live off my retirement fund, and then a year after I let go, then I went on to SDI. status of the average about 50% of my gross on my last previous job and the S the retirement benefit, I had the cash out early and i'm that cover me and then I got an ssd I they paid about two thirds of my growth so things are a little better and. Then I got the medical coverage to."
705.0,Provider,"Good that's quite the journey. yeah yeah but you're so you know you have such a variety of knowledge and all those areas Robert. you're you're able to go okay yeah I know about the percentages, I know what this looks like."
13885.0,Patient,"But the rules, keep changing I would be aware that you know. yeah when you say when you master the game they change the rules, you know and then that can happen at any time."
705.0,Provider,"I hope there's some reassurance when you think that you know, like you said, with the doctors, they have your history. You are right, you know that sometimes with having a disability, that they can't see externally sometimes people may may you know question, however, you've had documentation for many, many years now, and just like. Your mom to it's probably some of it was was. That record and also."
13885.0,Patient,"yeah and and then now i'm almost the age where I can be qualify for regular retirement, I guess, nowadays, I guess you get partial retirement, yes, six I think it's like 63 now, I think, to get a full check somebody's born in my awesome work till 67 I guess to get the full everything. The. FBI the full medical you know all that but. i'll see how that plays out later on, I that that a chat."
705.0,Provider,"Earlier like okay i'm just going to enjoy the day i'm not going to be already in tomorrow. Well that's that's good Robert so overall you know if we put a scale of one to 1010 being fantastic, how would you right now just overall rate how things are going for you."
13885.0,Patient,"i'd be i'd be pretty high today like I said i've been doing my walks i'm glad you guys gave me 50 bucks back that'll come in handy that kind of made my day a little better. um what else is happening. i'd say pretty good like I said, you know um. What else. Now the not looks like the forest fires. It might be down to little fires, whether it's no more hundred degrees, I think the weather it's been a little better, even if the cloudy skies, I still like it bare bones hundred degree, he with the bad air and all that stuff you know and all the forest fires and. Road closures, you know and. So the environment, I think, is in the weather, and you know that's been I think helping me to know. You know, to go for longer walks later walks when it's. Not so hot in the air isn't so bad i'm coughing you know and. And i'd say Batman like now main buckets seven and a half, I guess kind of three quarters of the way to the top, you know and."
705.0,Provider,What what would bring it maybe to an eight and a half.
13885.0,Patient,"Probably many things like you know i'm a little nervous about like I said, my. My economics like I said, my mortgage is going to be do when i'm trying to see how much warm enough to pay and that my utilities things that might go up and i'm waiting to see, I think, maybe in January i'll fall back or better picture what my SSI can be for the year. Have a better now or grip on my finances that I think will make me a little bit not happier and more. relaxed a little more secure. The holidays Christmas can be kind of a bummer but like I said. I kind of like this, though the light and the art was the holidays, if I don't get many gifts that won't be too much of a bummer that gifts are for kids. Well i'm passing anything holidays in general are mainly for kids you know i'm an old man and it's like to me holidays become another day of the year, you know. But you know my birthday is coming up December 13 and then kind of i'm thinking back on like far north California along the coast. there's a nice 10 mile hiking trail maybe get a motel room for a couple days do the tray or if it's raining i'll bring my brain Poncho you know when."
705.0,Provider,Right yeah.
13885.0,Patient,"What happened i'll still enjoy the walk it out of town I taken the road trips haven't taken any road trips because, like I said, my budgets kind of tight right now. I had my car ripped off and it cost me like three grand three four grand to fix that up so getting over that to you know one."
705.0,Provider,yeah well i'm i'm glad that you're making plans and when finances uh well that sounds nice to go and do that he said it's up on the coast.
13885.0,Patient,yeah like Eureka California Eureka CREST the far north on the coast. yeah away from the forest fires and the. smog and all. You know that. Those road closures and all that.
705.0,Provider,But it is beautiful I went there once and it's just gorgeous.
13885.0,Patient,"Although I read if I go to motel six they said go the one in your region or arcade and not crescent city, they said the crescent city motel six the dump or the one in your week as little better managed and. bothered. about the same distance betrayal. Like 35 miles probably half hour drive you know, but they said, if I gotta go to motel go the arcade on the South not crescent city i'm in North I know they got a big prison up there."
705.0,Provider,Are all good things to know and it's not listening they're. Preparing and doing the homework sign of it to.

705.0,Provider,"Okay, this, there are certain days of the week that works best for you."
13885.0,Patient,"could probably a stick with the wind station, now the home base."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and twice a month is still okay with you."
13885.0,Patient,"I would think so yeah twice a month with you, and once the group let's see how that works, you know. that's critical and i'm not i'm not touching a critical. Mental health crisis or condition, where i'm one step away from the hospital, you know not at that point yet anyway."
705.0,Provider,"right but it's Nice that we can check in and then that way in the event that there was something we could talk about it and try to get you the best support we're, to the point of needing hospitalization where we could. go through outside supports."
13885.0,Patient,"Right and, as far as medication goes, maybe i'll just try and take now the piano track not taken like two three years old, but it still working you know I they say a lot of times the expiration dates on so much for ation. But for the marketing purposes, you know. My God trashed him I got those sleeping so I may not need site medication for the moment, you know. Maybe find get better at sleeping you know and access, I think I see like four hours a day, you know what."
705.0,Provider,four hours that's not a lot of hours.
13885.0,Patient,"But um I guess if you're used to, I guess, some people don't these businesses go to law school go to MED school, they can get buying little sleep, you know and."

705.0,Provider,Okay.
13885.0,Patient,"And maybe volunteer work and we're going to be able to hold off till the next calendar year that's i'm I can think about and the further future like the animal walking dog walking animal shelter that's maybe a further longer term goal. i'm just saying that might help me my trust me my patients to you know, like I said. With the dogs my pit walking and dogs could develop patient patience, you know being around the other people with the shelter other dogs now with the trust those are my two person. Mental health goals, I guess you can call them, you know and."
705.0,Provider,Quite.
13885.0,Patient,"As far as medication, maybe i'll see if I can just stick with the PR ends, if I need to sleep, you know, on."
705.0,Provider,yeah and do you have like Robert I call it like sleep hygiene or asleep routine.
13885.0,Patient,"What would that be, I may not have a general idea, but what about the deal, how the details, you know I I kind of know what you're talking about exactly how I go, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah a lot of times and again this is going to be you do it, Robert style sometimes people like to have like no TV and no phone you know. hours before bed, if you like, a Roma therapy sometimes people will put some lavender or something or listening to a certain type of music that gets your your body more calmer, maybe do some deep breathing exercises."
13885.0,Patient,"Nice yeah I. Like it the group, you have those holistic, you know the stretching and yeah that might something to think about."
705.0,Provider,just see if it may help. calm before you know before you try to sleep.
13885.0,Patient,Non medical yeah I think that may not require any medication that makes sense yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Anything else, then as we're talking that you think that you would like to."
13885.0,Patient,I was gonna ask you what what's your job title and your education i'm just real i'm just curious what you lcs w mf tear mental health worker associate degree know what your job title education and.
705.0,Provider,sure what I have is what's called a laid back and so with that it is.
13885.0,Patient,an acronym.
705.0,Provider,"yeah well, I have a couple of acronyms so laid back and so that's a licensed events alcohol and substance. it's drug counselor and so that's that I have through see CAP and so that's at the Masters level for. substance use disorders and then we can do like coping skills and things like that. Then I also have my clinical clinical supervision certification. And I bring on then, I have another one that's called CC JP and that one's a certified criminal justice for alcohol and drug counseling."
13885.0,Patient,Right so i've had.
705.0,Provider,A lot of years working in i've worked for orange county department of ED so over to the education systems i've worked in the criminal justice systems. For the military and then now Brian heart health.
13885.0,Patient,And i've worked for crisis tips like for me no offense but i'm not I don't have a criminal record idle. Not Mike you know the called mainly alchemical way i'm just my i'm not you know i'm a Leo but not chemically addicted you know so.
705.0,Provider,"And a lot of what the coping skills are because I know a lot of times people. will say, well, so you're you know license advanced alcohol and drug counselor and say, yes, so some of the coping skills that may be used for. more of a substance use disorder are also used in other disorders, that the coping sales strategies. yeah meditation things like. cognitive behavioral therapy that that can work, not just for one route."
13885.0,Patient,"I think. I think we are saying is you're more of a holistic approach in a strict medical approach you know you. know I see you're like non conventional i'm just saying you tend to focus more like i'm not the. that's the counseling the physical exercise post just given people medic medication, like the psycho like the brick and mortar neighborhood psychiatrist you know more seem to be more holistic, you know more. from within, you know, and then it is just take two pills and call me in the morning type thing you know and."
705.0,Provider,"And more on I believe in in a personalized where everybody is unique and so we all. like things to be different and and that's where we're going to you know if if you have a choice, and then you choose what you want to do, then the likelihood you're going to do it as much greater because you feel empowered and it. Was choice."
13885.0,Patient,"You were talking about Robert style Valerie style, as opposed to Dr so and so style yeah. Exactly one size fits all."
705.0,Provider,"yeah Thank you Robert. Exactly, and so we can you know a lot of times i'll share like these are different coping skills. But you can either add to that adjust or sometimes it's like no that one doesn't work for me i'm going to try something different."
13885.0,Patient,"So I remember i'm in sacrament I don't know if it's worth down I said the year from anaheim or orange county called the consumer moves with mental health. Patients as consumers, they calm consumers because. Mental health consumers make choices, where patients have choice made for them, and I remember that I was at park I worked at a job in that movement, you know they call me to help consumers because I guess. That implies that the people with the mental illness have have more choice and what their doctors and therapists order, as opposed to decades go when men Leo people mentally ill people were thought of as. incompetent, not knowing you know they had to have everything done for them, you know or. You know now the approaches your men Leo but you I guess the consumer method wants the mentally ill people to do research on their own talk more about things in their mind, and not just have people take care of them, the doctors and the nurses take care of them, you know. Less institute's look less institutionalizing and more outpatient therapy, you know, instead of having to go into a mental health for a week, sometimes problems can be solved. By just going to come rst to talk to a therapist and maybe your problem solved in an hour not having to go spend a week and 5150 or 52 if you know, whatever."
705.0,Provider,"I think you know, Robert that. we've come a long way, as you know, if we think about it globally. With especially mental health issues, and so I hope that we just continue to know the more that people become educated like you brought up a good point earlier about how people don't see. A mental health disorder, because they don't see like if you break your arm and you have a cast and people know you broke your arm and. Right mental health it's like well it's a little bit more of a okay you can't see it, but it definitely is a disorder and it definitely can be treated, we know that."
13885.0,Patient,"Because like I always say in life, sometimes insults worth in the injury. walk on if you're mentally ill people. are afraid you don't want to talk to you it's like you know I remember, I guess, in the decades go people trying to cure mainly on people shock treatment and hold locking them in a room and things I guess. centuries ago they use leeches. Trying to suck out mental illness, the witch trials, you know i'm just saying I think psychiatry treatment is evolving every year, you know. it's not the point where just take a pill, and it goes away, but I think it's also learning to deal with the symptoms of the mental illness to you know take away some of the install you know focus on, you know get rid of the insult, you know and focus on healing the injury, you know and."
705.0,Provider,"Now we all have different things that you know that are challenging things that we excel at things. say no, we all have our different preferences."
13885.0,Patient,"Right different chemicals, yes, like a learn about Sarah tone and then I think when another one endorphins you know things up night and learning things that I didn't learn in biology in high school, you know or elementary school things they learn, because I was mentally ill, you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13885.0,Patient,"They don't teach that to everybody in high school or college biology or chemistry, you know one."
705.0,Provider,"That is very, very true and that's where you know, looking back now you have years of experience, where maybe somebody that's 20 doesn't have the experience and the knowledge that you have today."
13885.0,Patient,"right that old saying I wish I knew now what I knew back then, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is, but you know we learn we learn from our mistakes and. Moving forward. yeah. Well, Robert I know, then, that we set up the two one for November, the third and the other for November the 17th. Both of them are at."
13885.0,Patient,930 okay.
705.0,Provider,You can you can choose which group that you want to come to.
13885.0,Patient,"will stick with first of the month for now yeah. Okay i'm team to eat on a Friday eight o'clock fec for me to remember i'm an early riser so you know, like some of these people to do new maybe they do it on their lunch break you know, give them a chance they can do that if, after work, they can do with during their lunch, you know and. But yeah i'm happy with kind of schedule I got now you know first Friday of the month for the group eight o'clock and then the 930 on Wednesday, I think i'm in a good good position right now."
705.0,Provider,"Okay well good then Robert i'm glad to hear that and I look forward, then when we're going to meet again on the third to get updated and see what's new with you and yeah that 25 if you can do the 25 miles that's like I saw a lot of miles. But."
13885.0,Patient,"Well, I got two weeks I got two to three weeks to get it accomplished so okay i'll let you know."
705.0,Provider,"Okay well shoot already to me success, you did 18 that's like that's a long distance."
13885.0,Patient,"Okay, you later alright."
705.0,Provider,"Alright, so patient is saying he's not suicidal no intent no and no plan, so the assessment would be no risk for suicide ideation no risk because he said no plan no intent at this time that he's not having any thoughts."
