748.0,Provider,i'm okay how about you.
15524.0,Patient,"i'm been better, but."
748.0,Provider,So what's going on.
15524.0,Patient,"holidays yeah holidays and i'm just kind of got no heat no hot water. kind of living water. yeah it's kind of messed up kind of messed up living this way not then I got this hip pain, but I can't really get up to help myself so. Few issues here huge is there. These medications I got I bought something online they're aggregate at. The things that please use like it's a substance that you use to test your mettle test the drugs see what kind of car you see what color it comes back you know, a call region reagent and. So, so I use those testing my medication and I changed it to. xrs at all xrs. Instead of regulars what which means instantly release yeah."
748.0,Provider,What bright heart is prescribing for you is adderall xr.
15524.0,Patient,"Now yeah this week. Okay um yeah for some reason it wouldn't qualify under my insurance insurance didn't want to pay for it, so I can't I went down with the cash and pay for it, I. i'm curious why they wouldn't pay for it. it's kind of weird I didn't understand it, because they paid for it, you know before. Now they won't be. So. Anyway, um I got I got him back. weeks worth and then. I tested on and. didn't have any. colors. Then come back color coded. Now."
748.0,Provider,I don't know what that means.
15524.0,Patient,"Like you, you know you have your watched. yeah you ever seen him breaking it drugs in a bag and then it comes back and different color their regions or is substance it's a it's a liquid, so you mix it together, and if it comes back orange it means it's either method method feathering or whatever it is amphetamine. And if it. comes back blue it's a different substance that comes back, and now that cali and then, so I got three different kinds tomb are are qualified to test for amphetamines and one of them for one of them does methamphetamines and amphetamines. So it can diagnose, you know it can't tell the difference between the two, but it'll come back orange if it's one of the either one of those the other one I had will check if it's. Just. I think methamphetamine so."
748.0,Provider,"So, how did they come back what was the result."
15524.0,Patient,"Then come back as anything. Okay, then change the liquid color at all."
748.0,Provider,What does that mean it. will get his data model.
15524.0,Patient,"One of them changed the orange it did change the orange and then it quickly changed to another color which is. I was like oh no work, you know, I was kind of I was like Oh, this is okay it changed orange then it started turning into a Brown. The other one did not work at all, and as far as my body goes it's working. My brains not. You can probably tell by talking with me. it's not quite on par. yeah. that's that's how things are going."
748.0,Provider,It seems like you're really struggling.
15524.0,Patient,As stressful yeah struggling yeah. that's that's the gist of it struggling struggling too difficult it's too difficult. To be and going through the way I am. it's almost next to impossible to get keep going this way I don't really see how this can keep going.
748.0,Provider,That seems like you need and deserve a lot more support than what you're getting.
15524.0,Patient,i'd like to be able to have a fighting chance yes.
748.0,Provider,How is you room that you're in bright hard is that supporting you.
15524.0,Patient,"is just a group. was just a group. Okay, so supportive okay yeah I could see that yeah Okay, this is the best thing I got going on. it's what I look forward to. So I mean enjoy it."
748.0,Provider,Okay well that's good that's good. Are you feeling as though you're making connections there.
15524.0,Patient,it's kind of difficult online.
748.0,Provider,To make connections with people really I feel. It really is.
15524.0,Patient,what's.
748.0,Provider,"jointed in bed with the new variant we're in for another, who knows how many months of. No hope that we'll be able to do anything in person. Which is very challenging very painful."
15524.0,Patient,No.
748.0,Provider,"Well, as far as groups and therapy and things like that the State mandate will still be and I know bright her doesn't do that anyway, but, but there are Community groups and things like that that could be in person as an adjunct but they won't be able to so. yeah."
15524.0,Patient,cool how we fix us.
748.0,Provider,So very challenging time isn't.
15524.0,Patient,Confusing yeah. And I think confusion is entering a lot of things that i'm doing. Anything it's all. In confusion. Is the biggest problem. I don't think a lot of things are would be a problem if I if I was so confused.
748.0,Provider,"So tell me about the confusion, what is the confusion."
15524.0,Patient,"Focus i'm not focused I don't know exactly what direction i'm going sometimes I don't know exactly what direction i'm doing what i'm doing so that's just not the way, I think, life is live for anyone I think i'm living life in a way that most people. I don't know how to ask for help. I don't know where to ask for help, I don't know exactly what to ask. But I know I needed. don't be sleepy I need help."
748.0,Provider,I agree.
15524.0,Patient,me the. One that you don't know how to help me as well.
748.0,Provider,"Well, I keep feeling as though. You know i'm what Community are you and again."
15524.0,Patient,Maybe.
748.0,Provider,yeah where do you live.
15524.0,Patient,me. What town. yeah Bangalore. Bangalore.
748.0,Provider,Bangalore main.
15524.0,Patient,Just one.
748.0,Provider,"I never knew that. Oh yeah you have. yeah for some reason, because you were assigned to me, I thought you were in California."
15524.0,Patient,Right and you're in San Francisco.
748.0,Provider,i'm in the Bay area yeah. Outside San Francisco. yeah.
15524.0,Patient,course don't do this sure.
748.0,Provider,"That they're very different. resources so that makes it even more challenging for me, I know main has less resources, I there was another yeah."
15524.0,Patient,What and i'm.
748.0,Provider,"In the bay area I would be able to think of. Community resources or if. you're a lot. Like right now, like."
15524.0,Patient,"I got this thankless program it's a home repair management program hopefully. My caseworker will help me tomorrow afternoon. But I don't yeah. I don't know how that's gonna work out i've been trying to get get in touch with this lady called Shannon since last week, and she won't she hasn't called me back the winning to these phone calls."
748.0,Provider,"yeah middle of the holidays so. that's not completely surprising, but i'm sure it's. cold. yeah."
15524.0,Patient,"very, very cool. I mean i'm stuck in a bed and bedridden. I would. rather be I don't know anywhere but here. This isn't the way supposed to be I don't understand any other way for medications to come back on the negative like that on unless i'm in a clinical trial that i've looked up. And I don't know how to know if i'm in a clinical trial. How would, I find that out."
748.0,Provider,"Well, you wouldn't you wouldn't know if you weren't a clinical trial, but you're getting your medications."
15524.0,Patient,Wrong the point. Is that not the point is people would not know they're in clinical trials be isn't that part of a trial.
748.0,Provider,know.
15524.0,Patient,To be on bias. well.
748.0,Provider,"You when you're in a clinical trial you wouldn't necessarily know whether you were in placebo or in the group with the new medication, but you would know you were into clinical trials. So and. you're doing any clinical trials, so they wouldn't be prescribing new clinical trial medication."
15524.0,Patient,"So that would require an interception from it, if I were in it and I didn't know that would require something local to be able to intercept. Somehow. Because i'm curious I keep talking to the pharmacies and then. He keeps pushing the buck like. I don't know like is, it should be much more surprising them I don't know. If medications don't work, it should be much more surprising, then I don't know I don't understand hey you know, he says well these. Pharmaceutical companies, they all own each other, anyway, and then, if you maybe try the czar's maybe that'll work um Okay, and I say tested them, you know, like an actual test everything except for the $3,000 machine that does the laser test. So. Just. stressful that I don't know how to get now here when I really need the medication to organize my thoughts to do these tasks. In the first place. kind of standing up for myself when I can't focus correct. yeah I guess. just keep taking days away till they all disappear. don't know why my parents my whole family would disappear so fast, I know my mother's passed away, but my father disappearing, at the same time. sphere and uncles cousins and not not without even asking questions so much nobody wants to ask questions about anything. They don't want to inform me about anything when I feel if I was in phone. Things wouldn't be so difficult I. feel like i'm taking a hit for somebody. or something for other people, but definitely not for myself."
748.0,Provider,So you haven't had any interaction with family.
15524.0,Patient,know. A couple people on Facebook so.
748.0,Provider,hard to have support when you're feeling so isolated and.
15524.0,Patient,Over things that I don't think or even true.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, like what kinds of things."
15524.0,Patient,"I don't know this from the very end of life. But if I can focus at least I could control these situations, my own variance would be control with the medication, instead of vice versa. And we'd rather control things by killing things instead of. respecting them for. All the sacrifices they do their."
748.0,Provider,mates backwards.
15524.0,Patient,"I mean sacrifices. I made a lot of sacrifices in my. Other people test me a lot and I don't like it, I didn't like it. it's kind of. stuffs getting into a hard time focusing on what i'm supposed to do so, I need these medications to be proper I know you guys are sending the right medication prescriptions. But I gotta figure out a way to make them work to get them from prescription to actual benefit fishel situation to work. They give me the viewer prescribing me. Water right. Should I be I have to find a way to make sure I get it, at least. Five and rations rationed water I should be able to. Control that outcome, somehow, I am in the United States of America, and I feel like i'm in a Communist country. You feel control my own medication and I feel that's very calm, yes, I feel like it's not American I feel you. feel a lot of things happening to you very unamerican."
748.0,Provider,So what feels like it's a Communist country.
15524.0,Patient,"feels like it was just explained okay i'm not getting the help i'm trying to get i'm trying to get help i'm getting i'm getting joked around. Months as. We see here because I can't focus in the right direction with my brain I need this medication more than almost most of the people they get prescribed it i'm the actual reason. The reason is basically invented. i'm the one that needs it, the marks. A phone quite a few adaptive mechanisms in my brain to to cope with attention is issues. With of certain bending cutting corners cheating my way through life but they don't sound so positive when I say it that way, but that's what they are. Coping mechanisms ways of getting I with my efficient. You know, you asked me if I know the answer I don't but I tell you I can get you the answer that's enough right. supposed to be, but that's usually not the case, they say he so I remember being at work as waiting tables and my teacher said I was cutting corners. As cheating getting out early just not doing my side work properly. But I countered with the simple fact that I was getting done. I just didn't do it at the correct time as wiping the bottles down before I was actually cut. But I was getting done I didn't see how it made a difference. What time I was doing whatever I was doing as long as I got it done and I didn't interfere with anything else wasn't a problem it just wasn't. The way that they explained it, you have to be cut before you can initiate sidewalk protocol."
748.0,Provider,Did you like.
15524.0,Patient,"I need medication to focus on myself, so I have a patient's issue they're impatient but impatient I just don't have any of it at zero patients. Just don't know I don't know how to use it it's a it's a virtue, but it's definitely not a learned skill it's not something you can learn or be conditioned with. Or you can be can be conditioned into retardation I suppose. that's patients you're rocking in a chair drooling on yourself sure. that's patients. Taking my focus away and blaming me for being an unfocused person doesn't feel like the correct and."
748.0,Provider,that's not very therapeutic.
15524.0,Patient,"seems quite sanitizing yeah I. mean I blame for a couple things I go you're not attentive Jesse, we need to take your benzodiazepines because. I told you this stop and you didn't stop not paying attention, I must have a problem in need to fix it. So give up the benzodiazepines seeing if i'm more or less. But i'm still on focus because they took the. And then I haven't really gotten it back so. I think when I ran that stop sign I don't think I hadn't yet. I don't think there was any at all at all, so it goes a little bit benzodiazepine I don't think there was any."
748.0,Provider,When did you run the steps.
15524.0,Patient,"back when I was going to the clinic. I was on methadone to. But we don't talk about the method on a blame any dope we don't blame the dope will blame the medication that makes you a decent human being, because if i'm a decent human being. If I had opposition against being a decent human being, it says they call those enemies, I spoke enemies that want people to look like shit for other people so that other people will be on. Their side if there becomes a taking a side type of thing correct, so if somebody wants my doctors to be on their side. It would make me look, they would hope, I would look as trashy as possible offend as many people as possible and. As you just you know everything. that's just not good. So. To get help I need people they care about me most people innately care about each other, it usually takes a little bit of work to get people not to care about you. or someone to talk a lot of defamation behind you. or cause a lot of defamation behind your back. yeah state it's not really so much paranoid. schizophrenia that i'm. I. I am i'm worried about. Being schizophrenia, but i'm also worried. appearing it, which makes me feel schizophrenia i'm worried more about appearances of running right now. And that's that helps me that I think being schizophrenia is really just a matter of appearance anyway. I think worrying processes in our brain are natural and beneficial. Take those out. We got other problems. You don't worry you run stop signs. So I did run the STOP signs guys up at this look at the clinic. yeah luckily I had a license. To do these different programs stupid things. Because."
748.0,Provider,"How, you came to breitbart."
15524.0,Patient,"They tried to take my license so I had a get cleared for. know this is quite a little while back a couple years, four or five years. doesn't really matter where I. Go this. is actually done not doesn't seem like it's my friend. This town feels like it's somebody else like somebody that's in charge, I was run off the road by City Hall by city one of those 10 representatives really call those those guys you vote for."
748.0,Provider,Any Council members.
15524.0,Patient,"yeah one of them that I got run off the road by one of them about 14 years ago, and this was about five years before he became a city city or town councillor. But when he ran me off the road I got back off that big sidewalk plummeted back down, I was still in my tie from the funeral I was at my cousin's funeral. And even going home yeah I was going on. And just came from a two hour drive away and get home i'm almost home this this dude in this truck runs me off the road with this hot girlfriend inside, just like. This nerdy guy with a really hot too hot have a girlfriend for himself God only knows how that all worked out didn't match, but the problem was he rang me up on a curb that was more than four inches tall and sharp. Like i'm in a little tiny 13 inch tire neon dodge neon little tiny car wasn't comfortable. Basically me and my cargo. You know a lot of ruckus from that. So I caught him off I got out the car he starts talking laughing yeah with what you bet if I can go back and you guys, you know it's good for you, so a spit out. As a writer better better off night jag in your area card smashing you up probably upset because my husband's that. 14 years old passed away because he had. cancer. So I didn't really beat him up. I spit on so he press charges as he's a little bit, so I deal with them and other people i'm sure he's run his mouth I don't really get help from the town because of him, one person, one. Little nerd it's worked his way in with the shriners and everybody. So now I gotta deal with that. it's not good here went out. went out of this time."
748.0,Provider,Where would you like to go.
15524.0,Patient,"I don't know why it really matters. I don't want to be on Mars I don't want to be on Mars, what does it matter, the first problem is I don't want to be here, this is the pit of despair doesn't matter where you go as long as you're not in the pit of despair. People need status and more questions for me, this is not the way humans live if I put another person in my purse purse my situation love to see how other people will react like. I think i've done quite well for other people that would benefit them and they just don't seem to help enough not enough. it's not a. precarious position and I need to get out of this House, this is how this is where. I feel violated I don't like it you're."
748.0,Provider,gonna be really fun.
15524.0,Patient,"phil via this i'm even in the room, just because it's the biggest room but doesn't really matter does it. pretty good at looking the other way when, after. it's not fair. How do I get help I tried calling 911 was didn't really."
748.0,Provider,And when you call.
15524.0,Patient,"911 in jail, if I called back again. it's not a lot of help here."
748.0,Provider,yeah I was gonna say you're reaching out and trying to get help it's so painful to hear.
15524.0,Patient,"That you understand what i'm saying, every day, yes, doing what I just said."
748.0,Provider,I do.
15524.0,Patient,"Alright, so I said I called 911 and they didn't want to help me not only that, but they threaten me if I call them try to get their help again. Do you understand what i'm saying. confounded compounded and i'm losing this. situation here I can't even get medicated correctly to defend myself."
748.0,Provider,"What happens when you talk to her, she can tell about."
15524.0,Patient,"She giggled a little bit and she's she helped me. As I mean she does, I have to tell her how to help me, but she doesn't know out out me so she doesn't offer. she's an offer any help really it's just me asking begging for drugs, when we look like a drug seeker somebody that's a junkie just wants drugs. China help mine. Maintenance attention issues, nobody really cares about my issues. They only care about making me feel like a junkie. And I hate drugs given up all drugs they used to do drugs. It was cold those heroin, it was more thing, though, is oxy cotton this box of oxy cotton. And then I found out shoot I might not have even been a junkie had I been medicated properly in my teens. or had to do is focus a little bit do my schoolwork care about school not extracurricular things. retired in the breeze waiting to be thrown in the trash. What fair. I didn't even lose myself i'm not the reason. Not the reason people wanted their hate, but I guess. What is the reason people don't like people they don't like them, because they can't teach you can teach them. You kind of just don't want to do that right that's coming out with the teachers did."
748.0,Provider,"Well, I know it feels that way in schools, because people are so overwhelmed that that's what."
15524.0,Patient,"It is. Because it's giving me an attention and medication. Man really do that nobody did I was only one to notice and only one that cares. But if I say those things for mother, my mother cared about me. She didn't want to help either because we're. know not she had the fight against all these other crazy stupid teachers as well. And how you do that when nobody's really trying out that they're trying not to help. If you say, people are trying not to help you have to prove it, and if you if you don't think. Obviously they're going to start talking more smack. Like you're making things up you're crazy skits on Friday. As a whole bunch of things it's a really easy thing to take a person down. Enough backup it's real simple as not just a machine. process. So I need to defend myself how can you help me Can you help me."
748.0,Provider,"Well i'm the thing that's standing out to me and I thought I did this last time we met is that you definitely need and deserve more help within your communities, then bright hurt can give you through telehealth. So."
15524.0,Patient,"meditation is the biggest thing I have and i've only asked for one thing and that's the brain pills. The ones that helped me think in process knowledge. If I can process my knowledge. And I can I can do things I don't cook I don't I don't do anything my brain doesn't even think up a recipe of anything doesn't even make macaroni cheese I don't have the patience, it gives me patience, it gives me the the focus to be creative it helps me read else we do so many things. And all I have to do is prove that the bad guys were the bad guys to the city, if I do that if I go and talk all this smack about other people. The problem is it's going to go through other people first first is going to go down the chain like Oh, what about the parents. As well Okay, but then, once we clear all that up, it will be a decade later and then we'll get to the real people, and if it gets the real people they got real money people with real money you don't want problems with. Because they own people. And then. What and. What do they do. So you go well they've gotten, to the point where they can control little children So what are we going to do they make all that happy stuff. was going to go after the happy people. I don't even want people to go after him, I just want my medication and them to back off does that sound crazy to you what does that sound like a legitimate threat. All these variants that are threatening Who are they threatening to and why maybe because we just too many biblical crazy cults out there that just want to. Well, remember, we remember Hitler or like I am like one of those crazy things that used to do with those redheads and bonds, I heard a lot of weird scientific weird things they would do with kids. And then really all stop. I guess. One step away from finding time traveling mind reading stuff and once that comes to us they're going to want to get an inside look kids minds out there, making them do weird stuff to read their minds and see what they do they think. If they don't think anything will probably do it. If they don't do it again or. Something. Then they got to cover it up, probably kill you, and this is good so frantic stuff thoughts, but this is kind of a way that the future. Could could possibly turn into poop. We could possibly just sell our kids is rats in the lab I grew up right down the street 45 minutes away from Jackson laboratory the biggest rat lab in the whole country. branches scientists down this way. hmm. I saw some. awful yeah so all I said was let me be happy and give me some medication doesn't sound that difficult out me. just give me the wrong call it good, and let me feel awake so I can feel protected i'm traumatized in ways that people don't even understand is the only way I can feel and traumatized and feel protected is if i'm aware and i'm awake. it's not really work now. You guys are helping me, but something else is happening in between i've waited years to get this medication back. Two and a half, almost half years. Two and a half years they've taken that from me, I I stayed awake for six whole weeks so it helps me sleep it helps to regulate my cycle in my head, so that my body does normal things that piece when I tell it to it sleeps when I tell it to you. But without it, I can't do those things. If you use a straight catheter have to wait until on allowed us to. spend hours since i've been a child you're right off camera."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, I am I."
15524.0,Patient,"As I. say. And you know. I need real help and I need to be guided in right direction, who do I."
748.0,Provider,Am I am. in complete agreement with you and I.
15524.0,Patient,assure that I will.
748.0,Provider,be reaching out again and asking for more help.
15524.0,Patient,"cause anybody any problems, but not giving it to me will that's a problem. And if I don't get it done what. What am I doing what am I going to do where Am I it's always what am I doing, and then, when I get a problem where a task my brain freaks out because I can't remember the steps so much as to what. Like I was thinking today all right, I got to make this phone call me purse from my mother, I had to add the receipt that I got ripped off on from Google on on. Some advertisement on Black Friday black Friday was some vacuum shark backing for 75% off I looked up black Friday deals and it popped up first thing 75% off the shark back. And I said all right we'll do that I got I I ordered one, I made a mistake, I thought well i'll just email them and cancel it as quick as I can. And i'll order the other one, the more expensive one well I got them both at ordered and both I couldn't get any emails back. Either it was a fake fish site, but how could it be officially site if Google said it was already they wouldn't Google doesn't put things on the top of their advertisement pages that are fake they don't know, especially on the very top. How could that have happened. And now i'm trying to get help with PayPal it helping you one of them, but the other one said that ups delivered it to my side door already so I looked up ups ups as it's a one pound package never heard of a one pound vacuum in my life. So PayPal PayPal stopped helping me they said that they the provider for the people i've been emailing that won't write back. They said they provided PayPal with routing number. Through ups that said they brought me a package that's not here. and hopefully i'm still going to get help with the other one. Maybe they just ripped me off 100 and something dollars on one, so if I had these medications I wouldn't have bought the first vacuum in the first place, so what about just one. i'm buying. Just not making quality decisions. And i'm having a hard time fixing things. Wanting to even get out of bed. When I do want to get out of it, and I have in a half to get out of bed. starting to get these weird pains. don't know where they're coming from my brain felt microwave the other day this room was so hot."
748.0,Provider,It really need.
15524.0,Patient,"To get like it's cold here, and it was warm. My house is one for no reason, how the heck did they get warm in and like zero degree temperatures. that's weird."
748.0,Provider,"Well, I think that I promise you that I am going to follow up right now in between i've only got another minute, but i'm going to follow. up right now and make sure that we get. Some additional help you definitely deserve it."
15524.0,Patient,and appreciate you hanging out with me.
748.0,Provider,Does not and I.
15524.0,Patient,want you.
748.0,Provider,to walk me through this. And i'm sorry it's such. A huge challenge it sounds so people.
15524.0,Patient,"Stress out, so I don't want to explode.
