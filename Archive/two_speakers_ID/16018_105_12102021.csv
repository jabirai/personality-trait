105.0,Provider,This is joshua. say six. To eight.
16018.0,Patient,Good morning.
105.0,Provider,A different day is today i'm a day off.
16018.0,Patient,"No, no, not in the car."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so take a second, and if you have a little piece of paper something to remind yourself to check in afterwards, most people when they end with me, they forget they run off and they live their life."
16018.0,Patient,yeah I did the SMS yesterday.
105.0,Provider,And it worked.
16018.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,that's great.
16018.0,Patient,"I love hearing you like, would you like some more. Word peace and light."
105.0,Provider,"For today's work, yes, because today we're going to do some some legit stuff so. which you can do."
16018.0,Patient,probably a little better.
105.0,Provider,"i'm also you may want to grab this would be for anytime just grab some tissue and have it handy. And maybe you need and lots of water, if you have if your coffee is not nearby and you're more than welcome to that i'm just going to take about 30 seconds. And instead or note up. Maybe we could start with how your. Maybe your experience of yesterday just sort of as a transition from yesterday's group to today, maybe thoughts or feelings that might be leftover."
16018.0,Patient,"yeah. So one of the big ones that hit me was just like. I had mentioned it whatever you would ask for money might take it's. Like you know chemical imbalance, but then I also have my notebook because I found like a little. connection it was like drugs to. high. Doping nanograms to. With. Abuse of reward system. To."
105.0,Provider,get to behavior.
16018.0,Patient,"To drugs and it's kind of like it's kind of like putting it all together and so emotionally, the jeans. For me, since I started smoking be at such a young age of. Law. I want, as long as I could remember that I remember as a kid wouldn't want to. Keep like the. immediate response, it was like firefighter. is stuck with it because I have to come out of my mom's house, one day, you know that immersive time, and so I just a firefighter. firefighter I didn't really want to be I didn't know and. And my brother had no clue this loose. Like never burdens like remember, I never ever worked for something, and so it was. kind of. Like. dang I guess that most people I don't mean system was like. Oh. No so."
105.0,Provider,"Specifically. There is. and Dr aubrey all and I she's been developing a PowerPoint for it and. there's a book that is out, and I haven't made my way through it, but is there very significant. change that happens, specifically to cannabinoid it happens in the body. We have endocannabinoid in our own system, but it behaves in a way that we're normally neurotransmitters go this way, this one goes upstream, it is a very intimate it determines the behavior the sort of the on lover or off lover of a lot of other. neuro transmitters it's actually an incredibly the naturally occurring one so when because everybody loves this this marijuana and I don't begin to even. I won't mess with that love affair so so when when Dr rail and I talk we're we're being very careful like is this taking years because we know we look, I know how much you guys love this because you think it's perfect. But it's. it's not so. I won't get into the fight and i'm only i'm scared even bring it up now, because I think people it's like taking their right hand."
16018.0,Patient,"No, I can see. Where I went wrong me that was looking around. 11 years old kids shouldn't be smoking weed that's for sure nerdy. I was. Trying my brain as a kid so and I accept that I really wish I would have waited because now, when I smoke weed it's it's probably a whole different experience, because if I would have waited for I was an adult i'm sure I would I would be part of the whole different experience, I mean."
105.0,Provider,"yeah you'd have a different brain, but again my hope is to be able to bring this very gently. just pure science, because I don't you know, being able to say fry brain won't cut it, you know this is going to need to be presented in a way that people are not going to be scared. Just the science there's some really beautiful science to it. But. I know not only Dr rob real has read it and reread it and reread the book and I have made my way through it, I keep rewriting the first chapter it's so it's so. it's a it's just this tiny book right. it's just it's a book I, and I can't. it's so dense like I can't get past the first chapter she says just keep reading there's really great stuff and like I can't Look how much highlighting. i'm like i'm like. she's like trying to explain it and then I have another woman that's here in this in this program she's reading it like we should just start a club to just get through that book. But. I think it's because we all realize. how important it is like, I have a wall, not this wall full of books i'm not my problem reading it's just like this is so unique. And anyway so i'm excited and a little nervous, because I know I know how strongly people feel but I appreciate you even saying that. You have enough openness to to have the awareness that. very early on you, you know you set in motion those things that that I repeat, which are you know you had a better than expected experience, the first time. And you may never get that same that same experience again right, you may keep chasing it and that's what people do so different for each substance. But specifically what you're what you're doing to your brain when you continue to put that in there is you're messing with the naturally occurring endocannabinoid inside your own brain so. i'm going to just leave it there, but i'm glad you listened because remember how you started he came in right and, like, I want to stay exactly this dose and here's what I think. Is my definition of the neuroscience of addiction and I listened to you, and it started to change as I heard back you know and i'm hearing it from you, starting to change and. Bravo right really it is a it's a complex diagnosis, because a lot of the diagnoses are based on on. behaviors but that's consistent for for mental health issues we look at the same you know ADHD we're like. They do this they do this behaviorally this this this because we can't scan the brain so it's much like other behavioral health diagnoses but anyway well i'm glad i'm glad you got a little something from it."
16018.0,Patient,yeah no that's great.
105.0,Provider,"i'd like to if possible go back and see if we can move forward a little bit more with the anchor room, I have some notes in front of me so i'm going to do my best to sort of bring it back to that. and see if we can move through the exercise if you need a sweater or anything to feel comfy."
16018.0,Patient,You could get one right. temperature wise.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. So, however, you can get yourself comfortable. What i'd like you to do is kind of take some nice breaths breathing in through the nose. and allowing that air to go to the bottom of your lung. I don't know if I formally taught you belly breathing that we can kind of get in the habit of that we bring the air in the bottom of the long on the inhale and on the exhale if you can. start to feel the air coming out through your lips on the exhale. So in the inhale through the nose allowing that air to go in and move all the way to the bottom of the longer your stomach expands just a bit. And then exhale out. just focus on the sensations. noticing the nostrils as the air goes in. notice, even the fabric, as it gently shifts on the inhale. continue to have that that awareness of your breath. And as you do so i'm going to bring some of the senses, to the anchor room that you had shared and just allow your creative mind to go there. And we'll do some work there. Remembering that this room. Is a room that. has everything that you need So if you notice that I say something and it's changed, and you want something else we just just corrected form and say no now it's this thing. And one of the things that it began with was exploring this notion of responsibility. that's about the age of 18. thoughts of always failing. There was a sense of emotion of sad. And then you add in a room a big room to this home that you're in. About 15 by 19 feet blue and white walls painted by you. Just to windows are closed, one is facing East and the other south. Both have a thick curtains. be comfortable bed headboard floorboard. Big TV posters of rap artists and scarface. And there's a mini fridge. Big walk in closet the small dresser for folding clothes and a place for hanging clothes. This is silver and black. futon for friends there's room for friends and guests. there's a new playstation gaming system. And then, looking at the door it's a white. wood. door with silver hardware. there's no issues like it's nothing wrong with it. The temperatures cold, because the AC is on all the turn. makes the bed feel more comfortable. can hear the playstation fan going birds outside the window. and outside this rose bushes birds there all the time during the day. can hear the air conditioner you can hear it click on and off. And there's a sense of the sort of. hawaiian. For breeze sent in there, the taste to Chris cold air. The body felt comfortable and relaxed. Mind body were laid back. and staying there i'd like you to notice in this in this room. where you are in the room and sort of notice where your hands are if they're touching anything if your feet are touching anything and just describe the sensation the tactile which means touch sensation. Of what you're doing in the room. Like what are you touching."
16018.0,Patient,"So i'm sitting on the side of the bed. side, I feel the. bed."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so say with comforter and I want you to describe how it feels we don't normally do that over slowing time down, how does the comforter feel."
16018.0,Patient,Like the cod. Cod.
105.0,Provider,Imagine your hands around it. You were describing it in a way that was only based on what data is coming through your fingers. Be is it.
16018.0,Patient,"yeah no it's gonna be it's gonna be like a living it's like a. yeah slightly bumpy. ride rejected it, and. one."
105.0,Provider,it's one.
16018.0,Patient,"One yeah. And so, and then I might be the. Like sharing content."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
16018.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,stay there notice the temperature their air.
16018.0,Patient,Right right. But not too cold would just want to jump right under the blanket. Little. Little Christmas jelly yep.
105.0,Provider,Like you didn't notice how you feel in the room what's the emotion that you feel.
16018.0,Patient,relax. Happy happy. carefree really.
105.0,Provider,Care free is the feeling.
16018.0,Patient,To bring.
105.0,Provider,"The guy to stay there. Keeping your eyes close i'm going to be asking you a question. And it might seem strange so i'm going to paraphrase it a few times and just hang in there until the answer comes to you okay. What miss information. Did you have to believe. As a young person. In order to survive. Sometimes we get misinformation that we now know is not correct, but we had to believe it to survive in our environment, when we were young. Sometimes we get it from our caregivers culture, a community. But you. have had to believe it in order to be okay and survive in your environment. But it's misinformation that you now know wasn't really true. get a sense of what was the misinformation, you had to believe, back then, in order to just survive in your environment. Okay. So oftentimes. When we're young. We get information we believe something to be true. That we now know as an adult a central, but there was something you needed to believe, back then, in order to be okay in your environment. But now, if you were to speak to that boy. you'd say. That wasn't the whole truth that that wasn't quite how the world worked on that isn't the truth about you, but you had to believe this, in order to survive in your environment. Now joshua you chose an age of 18 and it's a bit older oftentimes people develop these misinformation very young, so I was working with the age 18 but oftentimes children. begin to believe something, and they have to keep believing this thing. Because they live in the environment they do. But it's misinformation it's not actually true they didn't know that they had to believe it. You might want to consider going back in time, a little bit."
16018.0,Patient,"what's interesting. I understand the question but i'm happy with anything that I. have to go, you are my guess is that I could think of. That growing up i'll start like my step dad needed my mom right drug addict. good job. in jail, you need a third, but no I don't exactly understand why. It was quite the opposite. Was the blonde matching she. Obviously, know that now, because in after they got divorced she literally found him. 15 years younger than him just 15 years younger i'll even worse, but. Is there something. Yes, so so so I had to stop. it's got. To be nothing without her, but now i'm pretty sure, yes, true she should have left them, but she was the one. She was watching on him, obviously, but as a kid it."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's just stay there with that. So sometimes. Sometimes people can sort of stay with and see if you can stay with how old you are when you are having having this this recollection but he is this that this awareness was sort of their. needs my mom."
16018.0,Patient,uh huh. let's.
105.0,Provider,"get into the seven is earliest. So, have a sense of really being present with his emotional life and sort of embody being that age. Being in this room, the room you've created, it might be some things that are a little different because of course we started with the age 18 but. sort of notice what it's like to be seven in this room, with this misinformation pay attention to very subtle. Maybe they're not subtle shifts and tension or expansion in the body. and any change in emotion, for example, are you aware of anything broadcasting from the body. As you were talking about this misinformation."
16018.0,Patient,Was that notice anything broadcasting.
105.0,Provider,"yeah you know what's coming from your body, it might be, what do you notice in the body. Right now, what do you, what do you sense in your body. Where have anything. You have a furrowed brow you aware of that in your in your face."
16018.0,Patient,But never. As i'm transitioning to the to be going back to being seven. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Well here's what happens to stay there, keep your eyes closed. When I say how are you feeling it'll be right now. When I say what age are you sometimes we're back and we're seven in our memory mind right, but in our body you're still physically here so it'll feel you'll have a certain feeling that might get activated based on pulling up. Being seven. You see, so this is new to you, but that's kind of what's happening so, even though I say how are you feeling just what are you noticing it's just going to be sort of this constant flow of what do you notice now and what are you experiencing now. So being seven. What is did you notice your body and we've moved on a bit, but are you noticing any change from how you were experiencing being in the room earlier."
16018.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah I feel like a. lot less. Care very carefully so. Blocking. me.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Let me see if I heard you correctly, your voices soft."
16018.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,So it get as close as you can to if your knees can can manage even two more inches closer go for it to the microphone closer.
16018.0,Patient,To my ear.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, I got you I got you, so I think it started off as carefree but you notice there's a sense of there's a blocking out of things."
16018.0,Patient,Like the. evening.
105.0,Provider,"And in maintaining ignorance just check and see if your physical body. does something differently than when you are. happy and carefree. Like how are you feeling right now, so if you can scan your body, which means we sort of take this Superman scan as if it was going through you top of the head. forehead eyebrows into the eyes and ears and even into the mouth and the jaw neck shoulders back. chest, the guts. Right, the arms sit bones and guys. Calves feet. With this. Awareness of misinformation. Basically, how is the body doing. stay with the notion of coming from this little boy. I forgot to mention it's awfully important that inside this room, this anchor room this resource room is magic. Over on the wall somewhere or this. boy has the ability to press on a secret little compartment and it opens up and you can reach for a magic wand. He doesn't want it to be a magic wand, it can be something else, but for many people it's just that simple, they press on it, no one else can see it and opens up magic. Just imagine that you reach for that one while you're feeling this tense feeling. What is it that you would magically wish for. seven year old. oftentimes it comes from what is it that this seven year old wants. would help the 10th body and the blocking out of things. What would help look like. blanket and something to drink. checked them out. And who. Who can help him."
16018.0,Patient,himself. Right.
105.0,Provider,Who brings it to the room. magic yes.
16018.0,Patient,No yeah. We can help them do you mean like coming to. feel better.
105.0,Provider,"Since there's no way that that answer can come from me, it has to be what you noticed there's no wrong way to do this, except to rely on me. This has to come from you, so what What did you notice, without having to check whether you're doing it right or wrong, but there's no possible way to do it wrong for you, what did you notice how did. How did you get the chocolate, milk and blanket."
16018.0,Patient,We.
105.0,Provider,We use the magic.
16018.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"great wave a magic wand and we got a blanket and some chocolate milk. So just notice. How the body feels now that you have this chocolate, milk and blanket. pay close attention to whether this is. Helping. The tension. Whether it is helping the phenomenon of blocking out of things. If there's anything left just see if you can describe it to me."
16018.0,Patient,mother is one of my favorites here. happy to add. yeah the point. Is a. Few more.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and you feel more. guarded. Staying with that metaphor of guarded. I might shift some wording and see if this works for this boy, what does the blanket guard and protect him from be very careful to listen closely. pay close attention. is to protect him from. First things that come to mind are probably the most useful fitness exercise."
16018.0,Patient,People. here. locked up. With like a coven people to seeing them. And so.
105.0,Provider,When you look at that boy wrapped up in the blanket perhaps you have the ability to see him. You see him in your imagination. How do you feel toward him.
16018.0,Patient,No. it's. Good. I. wish I could give you that.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so we're going to do that, you have something you'd like to share with him and this might seem silly but i'd like you to say it out loud to him, and if you feel like giving him a hug, then you make it so in this room, you just make it happen okay. Just kind of tell me. Tell me as much as you can long way feeling what it's like. kind of moving in between how the hug feels from you and how you feel giving it to him and then some maybe some words at some point of what you want to share Take your time."
16018.0,Patient,almost immediate. gonna pick him up.
105.0,Provider,Keep breathing. yeah he needs to and you're right there you're right there you're getting him what he needs. He needs to.
16018.0,Patient,everything's gonna be alright. Everybody makes mistakes. there's a lot of people. including me.
105.0,Provider,"yeah you go so tell him how you love him tell him also specifically some things that you love about him. For a moment i'd like to see, are you still in an embrace of a hug see on your lap kind of where is. Okay. uh huh."
16018.0,Patient,Are. The future.
105.0,Provider,"really see him this one, I want you to build very slowly, there may have been times when he was not seen. You see him see him. Tell me the. Okay, and that's what we're doing so. stay there with them let's just start with holding again just go back to what it feels like to have known exactly what to do. is to get them in your lap. You knew to do that. And it worked you wanted to be there right. yeah yeah Okay, you can trust that. very slowly. being present with him in an empathetic way as in I get what you need like nobody else does, and I see you like, no one else does. And no one told you this, no one did this, but I gotta tell you something about you, and it is this thing it is this information people weren't saying this to you and I want to tell you now, what is it that he needs to hear about who he is what he is what he's going through at seven. gotta tell them, so it doesn't feel. alone or crazy or anything. yucky."
16018.0,Patient,I need. to worry about what other people need. worry about. What. Other people want.
105.0,Provider,you're doing great i'm going to help a little talk directly to him and say. I imagine you want. And I think you might know something about what he wants.
16018.0,Patient,"To be. treated by everybody, but. you're. never going to figure out who you want."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so stay there. that's where we're going stay there. asked him. If it didn't matter what anybody thought of you, what do you want, or what do you like, do you like you curious about being interested in really showing him. That you want to be with his interests. Looking at you. Now."
16018.0,Patient,yeah probably.
105.0,Provider,"So joshua what does it feel like to have this boy not looking at you, as you try to understand what what he likes. what's that like for you."
16018.0,Patient,A minute I know that I can start looking at me that he's actually taking. I feel like talking to a brick wall.
105.0,Provider,"talking to a brick wall he's not taking it in. Okay, so stay there were. suddenly become aware of this room feel the air on your skin one in this body, you have now and listen to my voice. notice your arms the contact notice how the skin on the right arm feels as it's being cradled by the left. notice your tummy being held. notice the chairs it holds your back notice the chairs it holds your sit bones, and your feet planted on the ground. you're in this room. You are not that seven year old boy, you are here. In this adult body with many lived experiences and wisdom and you and I. will come back to this. With even more support. Good nice stretch, as we are one minute over so we're going to come back here with eyes open. and tell me a little bit about what this experience was like for you and then we'll schedule an appointment together."
16018.0,Patient,"Now touching the kid. My spouse and I talked about a chance. to shine a new line. The iPod. glob of person not it took the tenure even. As a kid I know that my mother gave me in the world, but really when it came to like. You know, like. I can't go a day without picking my kids up and kissing him. I felt like I didn't really get that from her, even though I knew she loved me, but most of that energy went to. Sustaining relationships yeah I feel like that's where. me and my sister talk to, because I know she wanted the same thing. So I think about that often."
105.0,Provider,"So it's. Yes, affection, but just be aware that when we come back to this into this space, the speed this might surprise you, but you are going fast. And that might surprise you, because you're probably doing some things that seem pretty you know, this is what I should say, this is what I should do. The some of the things that you and I are going to do you're going to hear me interrupting you, and it may not make any sense but half as fast. there's some things that I may want to invite you to do in between that you haven't done before, which is what you can do with your wife it's the things you might do for there, or it comes from analysis like. Oh, you know I didn't get maybe affection, as much as I needed I need words of affirmation and affection and quality time spend time with me and asked about what I like and what I want. But i'm when we come back to this you're going to hear me probably say. to slow down, and I might I might decide to come back to this exercise, or do something, something else that can get at this that will encourage. More inner dialogue. But just just know that in this you can't do anything wrong so whatever it is that comes up let's say you're like I can't think of anything to say or I don't even want to do this activity that information is important, you. You might think know this therapist I would be doing it wrong, but you wouldn't I want to know every little thing that comes up, because then I can get in and I can say. This now, we can do this, and this, and this so don't think that there's some prescription there's no way you don't know this activity there's no way for you to know kind of what i'm up to here. So the next thing that happens, the next thing that comes up the next thing as quickly as you can say oh now this i'm noticing this or i'm noticing this now that's what i'm looking for. It won't fit what you think is supposed to happen in here that's the irony it's like well, I want to be a good client, I want to use this information for the therapist know. The Messier, it is the clunkier, it is the more it's like oh this thing is coming up Those are the things I want to know where and when they come up, because then I can really see where you are blocked. But this was this was quite helpful, you know, again I mentioned this exercise can sometimes take three or four sessions now, you can see why you're not we're not quite there, or maybe halfway."
16018.0,Patient,there.
105.0,Provider,"All right, let's schedule another time to meet and. I don't have any sevens open right now. Your router or."
16018.0,Patient,game. o'clock next week.
105.0,Provider,"Right yeah the ones are gone to um. let's do, what do we do to can we do two o'clock. raid I think I can do it two o'clock on December 15. Now you're going to be in your truck then correct."
16018.0,Patient,yeah yeah but.
105.0,Provider,"Oh just know that this kind of thing. You got to really be careful of like try and post them or what's quiet makes you have good wi fi see this can't afford. To have sketchy connection, you can see why right now, you know why I think like we're facing light, and let me be able, I want to hear every because i'm leaning in like this is your voice gets out my screen right there when you're talking. Okay."
16018.0,Patient,"Just because all three to get their sleep, on the other side of this door."
105.0,Provider,"And it worked it worked just fine, but I did have to strain just a tiny bit, so I will see i'll see you then i'm really proud of you, you did some good work."
16018.0,Patient,"Thank you, thank you so just to clarify December 15 at 2pm."
105.0,Provider,"Two yeah that might be by that time of day, it might end up being on my side closer to 205 but set your alarm. So that you were there okay cool. So it's a Wednesday so Wednesday. Thank. You bye."
16018.0,Patient,"All right, bye bye."
