I guess just a little bit of frustration with. My stress level with all of that, and having to get everything done is a building up a little bit with having to get everything done in the House as well and. This is making me a little bit edgy."
298.0,Provider,"Okay i'm. i'm kind of in the dark here, what did you order books for."
16625.0,Patient,college.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, what classes are you scheduled to take."

16625.0,Patient,beach.
298.0,Provider,"These things don't work when i'm on the new one Okay, so this is pretty exciting that you got your books ordered or they arrived."
16625.0,Patient,"they're not here yet they'll be here Friday, but I got an order so so it's still just kind of stressing me out that i'm falling behind without them, but i'm doing as much as I can you know."
298.0,Provider,yeah awesome.
16625.0,Patient,"This just kind of in the back of my head i'm gonna have to. i'm falling behind and i'm going to see if I can do, makes it worse, but doing the makeup work is going to make it even more but it's Okay, though, you know."
298.0,Provider,"All right, well somewhere Ryan needs a little bit of your business. get him to help you i'm all right let's see. Stephen high and low."
16625.0,Patient,"Oh, my is doing great and i'm working on getting my first degree to get my ID. And my low is. don't have one."
298.0,Provider,So how is it that you're getting your birth certificate like What do you do.
16625.0,Patient,"On my hand is in it a piece of paper to galveston Texas, to get 90."
298.0,Provider,"Very cool my grandson is coming home tomorrow, no Friday and he got his passport yesterday, his first ID so excited he got a passport before he got a birth certificate now how where does that, but he was just born a month ago. All right, thank you, Stephen anything else. No, no. Okay."
16625.0,Patient,"My high was the opposite of. The day that I went to the dentist she's worked on. And there it's all finished good couple different appointments. By low was it wasn't really. It wasn't a love interest have gotten scared in your car yesterday my daughter was there that she freaked out and there was bad, but it turned out to be that that that. was locked out and everything locked into the classroom."
298.0,Provider,wow. See OK now.
16625.0,Patient,"yeah she just got a little bit of it. I mean you know they probably started out with their friends and stuff and. The last one is. Like live outside. The other one is high, as I. Look at the transition into a clean sober House after this so kindly I kind of see what i'm doing now yeah."
298.0,Provider,Wonderful I know West and I are talking a couple weeks about you jake just seeing if that was a possibility for you so.
16625.0,Patient,kudos i'm.
298.0,Provider,glad it's working out.
16625.0,Patient,I love it so it sounds.
298.0,Provider,"Good that's awesome. Okay, well, thank you um I got six of you seven of you 123456 who who did I miss you know, there really is just six of you okay um so you looked at your pieces of paper and I asked if you would come back with examples of when you had one of or more of those cognitive distortions. Would you like me to read to you a list of the cognitive distortions again."
16625.0,Patient,here.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, let me see I did have it called up. So there's all or nothing thinking that's black and white thinking there's mental filter it's where you only pay attention to certain types of evidence i'm. noticing our failures, but not seeing the successes that's a mental filter jumping to conclusions that's where you do like mind reading or fortune telling you jump to conclusions. You predict the future. there's a cognitive distortion of emotional reasoning that's assuming that because we feel a certain way, it must be true. And we there's the cognitive distortion of labeling where we assign labels to ourselves, like i'm a loser i'm completely useless. there's overgeneralizing like everything is awful nothing is good that ever happens to me. there's disqualifying the positive there's catastrophizing or minimizing you blow things out of proportion, or you you don't pay enough attention to something. there's the cognitive distortion of should using critical words like should must ought, they make you feel guilty. Like you've already failed, and you people use shirts all the time and then there's personalization where you you blame yourself or take responsibility for something that isn't even your fault. Okay, so those are the cognitive distortions i'm gonna hope that each one of you can give me an example of things that you do and we plan to use the rest of our time talking about. Different cognitive distortions, you have um, this is a volunteer thing so anybody willing to start."
16625.0,Patient,"um I have one. So I usually use this one where it's like I have basically a kid my baby or am I, being moment but uh my my girlfriend of fucking other Dudes."
298.0,Provider,Okay. And so to help him out what is the cognitive distortion they're. Assuming he's jumping to conclusions.
16625.0,Patient,Because he thinks that he thinks it's real.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. So. there's a couple of things I hear you guys saying. it's an emotional range reasoning, because he's assuming he feels this way, it must be true he's jumping to conclusions he's predicting the future."
16625.0,Patient,generalizing. Everybody does it everybody.
298.0,Provider,Okay that's excellent didn't even see that one.
16625.0,Patient,She doesn't do.
298.0,Provider,"It What about MAC application is he catastrophizing a little maybe. Maybe yeah. What an awesome Stephen normally you don't give us something so substantial This is great that you identified, something that is a cognitive distortion, well done. Okay i'm ready."
16625.0,Patient,"So this week I jumped to conclusions, I thought my phone was on the charger upstairs in my room because I don't usually carried on me, I always leave it on the charger in my room. And when I came into the group room it fell out of my pocket in film to the couch when I went out of a group to go up there and gravity wasn't there I automatically thought that somebody took it off the charger took it. And then, so I had so many call it name is ringing in the group room."
298.0,Provider,yeah that's where i'm like. isn't that frustrating that your mind immediately went to catastrophizing.
16625.0,Patient,worst case scenario was trying to.
298.0,Provider,"Instead, you will almost we're doing an all or nothing thinking like if it wasn't at the charger than it stolen, you know. yep worst case scenario wow that's that's a really good observation of where you know you took ownership to faulty thinking good job."
16625.0,Patient,"So uh. minimizing and should. I minimize. time schedules. And that's a really big. Because being on time is a really big thing and then the ship kind of goes with it, because I think that people shouldn't. try out things sometimes that no, I think the well. Since nobody would ever say like since there's a line of people there, then you shouldn't care if i'm not standing in line like lines, I hate lines. So it's like with the whole time thing it kind of goes with the line you know what I mean so. Just because I think that I shouldn't have to stand in line that I could just do whatever I want and then come back whenever it's convenient for me that they shouldn't really care as long as I get there, and do it, you know. That goes with the being on time because. I minimize you know, like because it was like the example is like the guy here that does admit he said. there's a midline and he wants me up there, and the line and i'm like well uh. As long as I get there before you know, whatever the last two people are walking in line and you shouldn't care."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
16625.0,Patient,"So that's not really how the world works, you know."
298.0,Provider,Did you get in trouble with. The rehab place because of that.
16625.0,Patient,yeah I did.
298.0,Provider,Did you have to write a.
16625.0,Patient,Right so on.
298.0,Provider,"that's hard that's hard. i'm sorry that happened to you. So you were able, when you wrote that paper to see that you were minimizing something that they're trying to teach you. yeah Okay, and you had emotional reasoning going on, I think i'm maybe i'm wrong here but emotionally you felt like this is not a big deal."
16625.0,Patient,"There that that's why I felt like you should came in it's like you shouldn't care as long as I get here whenever there's like one one or two people left, then it shouldn't matter to you if i'm standing there if i'm standing down there, you should mind either way you know."
298.0,Provider,Does anybody have any other thoughts. that's the situation that happened on.
16625.0,Patient,"I feel like I can relate to his way of thinking. i'm saying is the fact that you know it's not a convenient saying anybody. Though I do understand you know, like the following the Rules aspect of the same time, I also understand that. This can take as long as it takes regardless, so if my time being there when there's going to be more convenient for me it doesn't really you know negatively affect anybody else, so I can totally relate to that."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I i'm Kevin right is that what just talk. yeah I love that you can empathize with his thinking, I do I love that you can empathize you guys are in a unique situation because they're trying to use every day activity to install new thinking patterns they're like it's not the real world. The real world doesn't care whether you get your meds or not."
16625.0,Patient,"They don't but, but also in the real world leg sager in the line at the dmv standing in line in the office and your two or you know you're two people three people behind. And then there's four people behind you, or you can't just walk out leave and then expect to come back and have your place in line you know what I mean. or anything. Or if say like they close the dmv and you were already in there, you know I mean it's like well the doors are closed and there's still two people in there, but I wanted to wait outside, you should let me back in because I was already in there and it's no big deal, you know. But that's not how the world works."
298.0,Provider,"No, I cannot tell you how many. How many times i'm asked to break the rules for somebody like every day like well can't you just make this exception and then Sometimes I feel like yeah but i've made this exception so much, I hardly know what it's real anymore. I get it it's hard for the people who are keeping making the world and trying to keep the rules and it's challenging for the people who are keeping the roof I get an excellent example, thank you for sharing."
16625.0,Patient,I got one. Okay um i'd say would be black and white thinking emotional reasoning catastrophizing. Oh.
298.0,Provider,just throw them all in.
16625.0,Patient,So when I received. paperwork. For child support. I made the assumption that my ex was trying to get full custody and pushing me out and treating me like a dead be you know and turning it into a battle like trying to take my kids from me. when in reality. is much less severe. Now I immediately thought worst case scenario.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and tell me the ones that you attach to it catastrophizing I heard that one what else."
16625.0,Patient,Was I thinking.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
16625.0,Patient,emotional reasoning.
298.0,Provider,Bingo yeah.
16625.0,Patient,And like making assumptions.
298.0,Provider,are jumping to conclusions. yeah. Did you do any personalization like saying this is my fault or you didn't go there.
16625.0,Patient,"Oh no not really. angry. Because. Because yeah I mean the assumption that I knew what she was thinking. And the. reasoning behind it. And it was only partially right. But yeah I mean it out to be a bigger thing than it was and I assumed that I knew her thought process. which I didn't, and I assume that you heard intentions which I did."
298.0,Provider,How long did it take you to figure out that you were having a cognitive distortions.
16625.0,Patient,A few hours.
298.0,Provider,"Well that's not bad that's not bad up two hours, but I can imagine your heart race, you were angry, like you, you went to 100 quick. Okay. um because that happened, are you slower to jump the gun in the future."
16625.0,Patient,that's yet to be seen. i'm pretty impulsive. So I can definitely say yes or no. yeah but I acknowledge what happens.
298.0,Provider,"This is on a different note is anybody afraid of authority, where their heart races and they quickly jump to the worst case scenario, and when around authority."
16625.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah.
298.0,Provider,"i'm in I have been working on talking myself down realizing that I do that for anyone who's in authority I pull that trigger on me that gets my anxiety going up, and I have to talk myself down. But I, but I have a lot of education, to look at cognitive distortions does anybody else talk themselves down and realize that that that's all it is. yeah."
16625.0,Patient,It took it took probably four or five different people you call me.
298.0,Provider,"Thank goodness people to talk us down. yeah all right, what a great example Thank you and I think you nailed it with i'm pulling out which cognitive distortion set is. anyone else."
16625.0,Patient,"Hello. As it out for me and. Possibly somebody else here, and if you're always almost. But. Then I feel like i've been kicked out."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
16625.0,Patient,"Usually after the same couple do people. Wait I realized that. This is a rehab and there are rules it's relative that everybody gets a little bit of trouble every now that there's a straightforward then pretty much usually everybody's got at least one you know, for most people do there's one that it doesn't have one. But yeah I just thought a I didn't say catastrophizing tipping oh my God, this is the end. This is there hit me up and attach myself, I really haven't broken any rules that terrible like. lay and. The other one was food viral and. Then also judgment inclusions I guess. yeah."
298.0,Provider,"jumping to conclusions catastrophizing did you do any. personalization labeling to yourself, like i'm you know calling yourself names."
16625.0,Patient,I. fail and then everything. Like I was bad schools but bigger is carrying on this mm hmm.
298.0,Provider,"yeah. What a good example. good job. If you can identify where the cognitive distortion is and and get into the habit of it you're quicker to get yourself, out of a bad mood to your quicker to leave that mental space. If you can really start seeing where you've got faulty thinking. My. This is kind of interesting and I want to talk about our parents, so my husband's parents were illegals and they lived in fear of the police finding out so if ever there was police around. The kids were taught at a young age to not move or you know just go into hiding, but their heart race thing you know and. Which is really kind of interesting because my husband came here illegally when he would know legally when he was 14 years old, but his mother. came here illegally and she had all those thoughts wrapped around being illegal and how much trouble she was in well let's fast forward generations here to my children. My children because my husband had seen his mother react to the police, he himself taught his children that if if there is ever any lights behind your car if a police ever our walks out to hold your breath. Like literally hold your breath my children will actually tell you that, if they are driving and they see a cop car with lights on, they hold their breath as if they did something wrong but it came from. Her their father, which came from his parents, and so I find it interesting that generation wise my children have a fear of the police, which is unfounded. Can you think of. Something that your parents did that they pass down to you some cognitive distortion. Okay what's the cognitive distortion."
16625.0,Patient,"covering up geez, I guess, maybe it's not. Knowing my emotions."
298.0,Provider,Now I mean so we're your parents one to over generalize and just covered up with alcohol and like.
16625.0,Patient,ever thought about it.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
16625.0,Patient,"I would say, having a very little trust for people, especially if they're being nice to you."
298.0,Provider,i'll maybe disqualifying the positive.
16625.0,Patient,Right and then. also see me to have like a feeling of indifference when it comes to. important things.
298.0,Provider,"Is that emotional reasoning you thinking, they were challenged with emotional reasoning and so when it comes down to you, or is it minimization."
16625.0,Patient,"I probably. But it's weird like. Like all cry at a stupid movie but uh but, like, for instance, like when my kids born or when my grandmother died was supposed to I like I was just like no but if I watch some stupid Disney movie altamira so I don't know it's just suppressing or what."
298.0,Provider,And you saw your parents do something like that to.
16625.0,Patient,Maybe my dad.
298.0,Provider,love that. Good thoughts.
16625.0,Patient,I guess my mom would do the name calling thing so name calling. Getting down on herself a lot and I definitely do that.
298.0,Provider,yeah I could definitely see where. That could be very generational where you would. pass that down. Have you guys ever heard of epigenetics.
16625.0,Patient,Oh.
298.0,Provider,"it's very interesting if you want to see learn something interesting do a little bit of Google research on EPA its EPI genetics and what epigenetics is is it how trait. of your generations before you are passed down in your family and that they have able to isolate genes and see this, do you know how some families, they they just produce go getters they're like type A people like the go get you. But they have they've isolated passiveness so many different things, so I encourage you guys to learn about it, because when we learn about. where we came from and what traits are being passed down for us it's the same as cognitive distortions if you're aware of it, you can rise above it. Did that fall on empty years I don't know you're all blank."
16625.0,Patient,i'm just tired.
298.0,Provider,Are you tired because of why.
16625.0,Patient,"just been so busy, and I just thinking about all the score that I have to go do whenever we're done here."
298.0,Provider,"Okay sounds good um i'll finish up here shortly, and then we can talk. I want to just. Give one more opportunity Can somebody think of something generation from your parents that's a cognitive distortion that was passed down to you."
16625.0,Patient,The whole list.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, then you're pretty wise if you can see that. Because it's so true we learn from people that took care of us we learn how to interact in this world."
16625.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I have a lot of resentments towards my family and. That regard just because. my grandmother was so abusive to my mother. And then that just fell trickle down and then I never really knew my grandparents on my father's side, but he was abusive and. Just. Some people. I mean everybody has. been through ship and some people have been through more you know."
298.0,Provider,"When I look at what I hear that my mother and grandmother went through it sure softens me to to how hard their life was and it kind of. It kind of makes sense, why I see the the the cognitive distortions of my mother so just a little history on my family my grandfather was a convict and. whoa look at the brothers blue sisters."
16625.0,Patient,We just got back from a doctor's appointment.
298.0,Provider,"well. that's okay so. There were tendencies all during my mother's life, like my father would write grandfather would write hot checks and so whatever they got on Christmas Day was usually gone the next couple days, if you want to see and, to this day, my mom freeze. The if the phone rings she hates it because she thinks it's bill collectors and so she. To this day, has these deep seated cognitive distortions, she was only a little child, but they were deeply rooted in her these things. I would imagine that she's not alone I bet you guys, to come back to think about your childhood and responses that you have that you're still having to this day. So, to the ladies who just showed, have you did you look over the cognitive distortions and do you have a story for each cognitive distortion have one story for something that you do."
16625.0,Patient,I looked at it and I totally spaced it out.
298.0,Provider,I want you.
16625.0,Patient,to lift yeah we knew this see.
298.0,Provider,"Oh there's all these are all cognitive distortions all or nothing thinking among a mental filter where you notice failures, but like not your successes, you only pay a certain you only pay attention to certain types of evidence I jumping to conclusions, where you predict the future. emotional reach reasoning, where you assume that, because you feel a certain way, it must be true labeling where you assign labels to yourself or other people. Over generalization. that's where people see. A pattern, and they use the word they words like everything is awful always awful nothing is good on just qualifying the positive just counting the things that happened to you because the other reason magnifying catastrophizing. minimizing what blowing things out of proportion, using critical words like should math odd. They already those words already make us feel guilty and we use them anyways or personalization you hear a story, and you think well this happens because. You know, this is my fault, where you blame yourself, you take responsibility for something that wasn't even your fault, so those are the 10 cognitive distortions."
16625.0,Patient,"i've always had. Before all or nothing that's what I was gonna say. If I can't. Do it all it takes 10 steps to do something and I can only accomplish to that, then I can start then there's nothing I can do. If it's time to cook and the countertops are saying, well, I can't start cooking because it has it has to start at the beginning, everything asked you to clean first and then prepped and then clean, as you go and if it can be done that way, then I won't do it at all."
298.0,Provider,excellent example so you've identified a cognitive distortion that you actually repeat over and over again. yeah. Do you know where that came from.
16625.0,Patient,"not getting it right, the first time from my God, I think. Oh go it's gotta be it's gotta start from the very, very beginning, it may take me 20 steps to get somebody to do something that will take somebody to steps to do that, I have to do all those 20 steps, because it has to be perfect."
298.0,Provider,yeah. yeah I would pinpoint that one on your dad that deeply in there yeah Tara.
16625.0,Patient,um I wasn't sitting and they all or nothing i'm just exaggerating things also.
298.0,Provider,Okay. be very specific in your example to me.
16625.0,Patient,Try to think of a specific. One off the top of my head actually. yeah I can't think of one off the top of my head. But I definitely have that all are. all or nothing if it's. Right or can't be done easily forget it.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. I know I thought that if it can't be done easily. Sam I I applaud you and going to school because one of the things that I would get overwhelmed when I look at the syllabus and see all that's ahead of me and think. Why am I doing this, this is too hard, you know and just fighting that cognitive distortion i'm proud of all of you, because you do this every day you're there at the rehab fighting cognitive distortions, whether you know it or not. yeah you're making new neural pathways. Okay guys you're free to go, unless you want to stay behind and talk to me thank you."
16625.0,Patient,Thank you Teresa like.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, Stephen I thought I just did that I will check fight and Todd yeah. Okay, well, I think I just refilled it Monday, but i'll check okay."
16625.0,Patient,"Okay, were you gonna. Are you gonna give were you going to prescribe me the lithium every you give me the alarm, Japan and you say you're going to wait a week, then."
298.0,Provider,"Okay yeah you have to ask you remind me, because we need to talk about that."
16625.0,Patient,um what work involved.
298.0,Provider,"yeah, but we can go ahead and start that process, and then in two weeks, do the blood draw okay."
16625.0,Patient,Alright sounds good.
298.0,Provider,"All right, thank you for letting me know. Okay let's see who's left."
16625.0,Patient,"I was wondering, I was. prescribed medication once it was a lady basically told me, it was serotonin."
298.0,Provider,uh huh if any of the antidepressants for serotonin would be great and how did you do with that.
16625.0,Patient,"What are the, what are the names of those medications."
298.0,Provider,Prozac paxil zoloft. lexapro.
16625.0,Patient,"I really like zoloft and I didn't really like. Prozac too much. That was on, and when I was younger. But um. Is there like. i'm always thinking about maybe trying something out because I take melatonin at night."

298.0,Provider,lithium is. Oh lexapro.
16625.0,Patient,flexor proper what is that all about.
298.0,Provider,So lexapro is another one of the serotonin medications what's nice about lexapro is it plays really nice usually and has a lower side effect profile than other meds. What lexapro does in the system is that puts a thin little film of a covering over your serotonin receptor so that it's not so exposed. And so you see you're not feeling every thing around you.
16625.0,Patient,"Oh, that sounds nice."
298.0,Provider,"Okay alright sounds well i'm. i'm still confused, it was Todd who just asked for the lithium right. yeah Okay, and I think we should give lexapro a try, if it brings you some relief, then it would be a good thing if you don't feel like it works, then we can stop it."

298.0,Provider,"If that's not working, would you like to try something called gabba penton they use it for nerve. They use it for nerve pain, but when those other things don't work I pull out something bigger to help with anxiety, they say that around 900 milligrams really helps with anxiety. it's an anti-convulsants used for nerve pain, but it seems to calm the person down, would you like to give it a try."

16625.0,Patient,"Or, I mean what are the other options, besides."
298.0,Provider,"seroquel have you heard us seroquel before. Okay, Sarah well, maybe that's a better option, I think we could go either way you possibly could look up either one but seroquel is an Anti psychotic but use did a lower dose it calms people down it's much stronger than. Anything that you've tried in the past."
