3121.0,Patient,hi.
226.0,Provider,How are you.
3121.0,Patient,Oh i'm okay i'm all right.
226.0,Provider,yeah i've been kind of hectic lately.
3121.0,Patient,"yeah it has been my my son at the good thing is is is you know the one at the part it's part there's some positive definitely. That he's there well he's gone now they let him go I was hoping that they would conserve them, or at least put them into. somewhere, but I really couldn't talk to anybody about it, and I was trying to reach people above his head and I couldn't really talk to anybody there it's hard to get through. And he's like he's like at this mental state of like i'm not on SSI he thinks that if he's not on SSI and he is mind that they won't bother him the mental health facilities and they want he just doesn't want to go on SSI and he doesn't want to you know he doesn't want to go into the. The hospital has actually a live in, where you go from 5150 into a sort of housing unit and then and they stay there for they used to be 30 to 60 to 90 days, and then they put them into then they try to put them out into the Community. yeah but he wouldn't have anything to do with that so he just wanted out and he called around and tried to. get a room for rent and show that he has this and has that and he basically they signed him off to get accepted by the gathering it's called it's a shelter. is called the gathering. And they have that down in plaster county and set county what on. Where you go and and they they have people sleep for the night, but then they go to a church and they have to clean it up, they feed them. And they can sleep there they have mounts and then they they have a place to sleep and they have food and clothing. But they have you know each day they show up, but they have to be sober."
226.0,Provider,Right.
3121.0,Patient,"So right away off my end i'm thinking, why would they look the gathering he's not gonna stay sober but. it's up to him basically have to let it go, I mean he was really coming back to Jason again sounding like my son again."
226.0,Provider,yep that's right.
3121.0,Patient,"Because they gave a meds and they got all the. Infection out. And they straight is a typical cycle, I think, with a lot of. People in the mental health system actually severely disabled."
226.0,Provider,"like that, where was the infection."
3121.0,Patient,It was in his. hand he had they had to drain it Murcia and. So he was in the hospital actually was a babysitter they actually had a sitter for him there for like. Probably two to three weeks.
226.0,Provider,and
3121.0,Patient,"He was in sutter. hospital and then from there when the mercer disappeared, he went over to the mental hospital. Because it wasn't mentally safe to put on the street."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so did they have a babysitter there for him, so he wouldn't leave right."
3121.0,Patient,In the in the hospital yeah yeah. They have a place to hold.
226.0,Provider,"Oh, it was the whole gotcha."
3121.0,Patient,"And so they babysat him until he was well enough and the mental facilities didn't want the Murcia entering their facility, of course, so, then it went away and then he then he was able to go to the mental hospital and they were able to hold them there for two weeks, but I don't think. They can legally hold them any longer than that. I did put a call into the conservator down there to see what and but I didn't get a call back and that's when they decided to let them go to the I don't know whether he was just not going to cooperate with what they wanted to do."
226.0,Provider,I really couldn't talk to anybody.
3121.0,Patient,"But she said, the nurse told me he was very MED compliant."
226.0,Provider,And he was very compliant.
3121.0,Patient,"And he took everything he was supposed to take, and I could tell mentally I could buy the days I could tell that he was getting back."
226.0,Provider,Now that's interesting.
3121.0,Patient,I wanted him just shoving injection and i'm like.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
3121.0,Patient,"like that, like my other son, but they wouldn't. They don't do injections are the only two pills. Now he probably won't take them so. huh but. it's okay it's just the round at least I know he's alive and well, and I can talk to them, and I did send them a little money. got a tiny bit. yeah but if he calls me all spoken and I won't send anymore. yeah I want to enable it. So food."
226.0,Provider,yeah right so is he on the streets again.
3121.0,Patient,"he's supposedly with the shelter. And he wanted me to send him a bunch of pictures, I was going to send him a wallet there that his brother had an extra one here and then some pictures of all of us at but I couldn't get them sent before he left so he said to go ahead and send him because he's going to come back. and He told me he has a follow up appointment and he said to send them anyway, so I guess, I will but. I highly doubt he'll show up but i'll send them anyway, because he might end up there and i'm thinking conservatorship takes several times doing that, before they can actually do anything to conserve him."
226.0,Provider,"Really, so it has to be."
3121.0,Patient,"He has to be consistently show the inability to. Take care of himself gravely disabled is one harmful to yourself or others is the other thing, but he was gravely disabled that's why they held him, so I just have to let it go and give them to God and. picture handing them up to God and here you go God, thank you for. helping me to get over my worry and heartache over him."
226.0,Provider,yeah God it's hard yeah.
3121.0,Patient,"So I just had to do that that's, all I can do and. And then I just it's upsetting sometimes it is, I just have to work through my feelings."
226.0,Provider,I now how could it not be you know it's and it's just been kind of a cycle right.
3121.0,Patient,"For a lot of years, I came up here to get away from it. yeah honestly and I had a piece, but then I have my other son here, but he had his dad now his dad's gone. And I have him here, but at least he's compliant with his medicine."
226.0,Provider,yeah well as any.
3121.0,Patient,"yeah Well he has to I mean he tried to get out of the shot this last month and I tried to say oh I don't want to go today oh this excuse that excuse, and I just stormed out of the store fine I said just see what happens to your life. And they said no, never mind i'll get it. went and got it. incentive food cards, they give them a food cart. They have incentives up here for people."
226.0,Provider,Together compliant. mm hmm yeah.
3121.0,Patient,"I don't know about down there but up here they do have incentives so. Nice that keeps Tony and the fact that he can stay with us once in a while and spend the night. and have a better relationship with us because his dad's gone. and his dad. worked to get them off the shot I don't know why he did that, but he really. helped him to get off his shot and get off his probation and all that. So i'm really glad that you know he's on it again."
226.0,Provider,Closing accountable does.
3121.0,Patient,"Yes, it does he can't hide behind daddy's leg."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
3121.0,Patient,"They didn't put it that way, but that's what he. was an alcoholic and. I don't know if he thought the medicine was good for him or not, but. I know he didn't like the way he was when he wasn't on it. right but. that's all we're done with he said heaven right now so and I know Tony misses him a lot. better off without him."

For me, it was just like I felt terrible at that time it was just I was so much pain. yeah and from the met you know, trying to get my knee fixed and then emotionally I was too, so I relapse nevertheless at that time. yeah not good.

Take they said it's almost done and they're building it I see so i'm really happy that. that's another answer prayer in the meantime I haven't a dental appointment and we've revealed for March, because at the end of December, it was cancelled and then so that's still there in case something happens and this one doesn't like pan out."

226.0,Provider,yeah that's great and is your car running okay.
3121.0,Patient,"it's got some problems still and that's got me stressed out, I mean it still has this stalling problem once in a while so we've been looking i've been looking online to try to get you know, look into maybe selling it. and getting another car that's just as economical because I don't I think it's just the guy said he told me the mechanic says those particular cars have a tendency to do that. And so i'm thinking about just selling it and trade and getting a down payment on something a little better this moment liable. So, then, I can. Like in my sister actually I was talking about this book study i'm really excited journey at the empowered heart it's this book I got here. it's really cool. She wants to do that with us online the women and the family, which I don't know about family members doing that i'm kind of apprehensive I want to do it really bad, but family members were pretty like it's talks it's about healing."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
3121.0,Patient,Right pathway to healing so i'm. there's a lot of inner personal stuff so i'm not sure if it's a good idea with family do.
226.0,Provider,I would say no. I wouldn't do it.
3121.0,Patient,yeah i'd rather not do it with family.
226.0,Provider,"I agree, make it like that's her safe space, you know where you can really."
3121.0,Patient,I don't want to open up to her i'm apprehensive I mean my sister knows me but. she's right now going through some stuff and she's pretty angry that's why she's doing. The book study I just. don't want. To be around anger right now.
226.0,Provider,yeah probably. makes sense yeah definitely I mean I.
3121.0,Patient,"She can be kind of see spews out a lot of like mean things that she says about people that kind of took me off guard a little that she's not wasn't like that, before there's stuff going on, that I don't know about i'm sure. But I don't want to go through that with her, I don't think."
226.0,Provider,and When does the book study start.
3121.0,Patient,"and probably. In a week or two. But I got to talk to her about it. Until I can read it i've been reading it. And there's a there's like a journal. And you read the chapter and then you journal. yep and talk about it. So, have you heard of the book."
226.0,Provider,I think I have heard of that book yeah.
3121.0,Patient,By katie something or other. journey of the empowered heart. yeah it's almost like doing a complete nutter fourth step to me.

I get nervous, so I just was tired. I gotta stay away from coffee that makes me anxious."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and brand just other coping strategies, do you do breathing."
3121.0,Patient,"know, but when i'm laying down, I noticed my breathing changes. When I relax and take time for myself my breathing changes, I want to exercise i'm going to get out and get rid of this nervous energy I have. i'm going to go walk. Like a couple miles I think today."
226.0,Provider,it's a great idea.
3121.0,Patient,And then come back and do some deep breathing and stretching and.
226.0,Provider,"participate. or deep breathing will really help relax your system. So. yeah breathing in through your nose holding it and then breathing out beer now. yeah i'm do that at least 10 times. You know, and so on the inhale you're really getting some you know you're getting some oxygen in and blowing it out."
3121.0,Patient,"yeah that does help still like it helps me taking time to do it. I got to stay away from this coffee I don't like it, it makes me feel miserable. Like coffee. decaf."
