214.0,Provider,i'm good So how have things been.
13084.0,Patient,Generally thesis.
214.0,Provider,Has word is still work on the positive side.
13084.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i'm like kind of Okay, like a super unmotivated. But like that I don't know like. A nine a bad mood, though, like i'm not I mean like I obviously would rather be at home, like i'm tired, but like it's not i'm not tired and like a depressive which type. Of stuff I did sleep well but. As far as like dealing with my boss like I can, I can tell that my anxiety is still there, but it's not as like noticeable you know what I mean but she's been in a better mood lately too so that's good but we've been kind of slow so it's been all right, but we had a we had a hard case. couple weeks ago it was she was 34 and she committed suicide and her mom founder she slit her wrists like really bad. So it was really sad and like it was just like when we get the younger people it's just like it's harder on me like you know I mean, especially the sidewalk I lost my best friend, you know what I mean and. So that was like that was like definitely hard for me on that cremation because they came back just the cancer in this district came back to witness the cremation and like i've never really been like like i've never really console like like. I guess like embrace like a family like as far as like giving like my condolences, you know, whatever like I mean people are still giving me housed in like 10 things here and stuff like that. But like it was just one of those things where like I had to like literally like put my arm around the mom and like put my hand on her shoulder and like walk right down and like. You know she's just like crying and it's just like you know I told her that you know she was telling her cuz she they're they're super Catholic, so I was like. You know, I was like she's in heaven, you know blah blah, and she knows she's like I worried because you know the Bible says that if you commit suicide like you know you won't go to heaven and. I was just trying to like talk her off the ledge you know, like no she was struggling like he knew that you know, God knows that she was having a hard time. You know there's that the other and like trying to make her feel better and then like I could hear the cremation like going. And then, like I walked by and her sister was just like on the ground. And, like her mom was being hugged by you know her husband or whatever, so I just went in there and just picked her up off the ground and this poster for a couple minutes, and it was just. I don't know like it just felt like the right things to do, but it was just like it, it really like yeah it was it was bad like it really was. You know I mean but that's a part of it, but you know that was just recently, I was just kind of like that was tough but other than that, like i'm in my. Time i'm good i'm happy, the only things that are like really bothering your this more of my my like deep seated fears and like especially like you know."
214.0,Provider,What is a deep seated fear what is that the talking about.
13084.0,Patient,"Like Okay, like, I have a fear of just dropping dead like out of nowhere, I have a fear of you know, going to the doctor and i'm saying. Oh, you have you know stage four cancer, you have terminal disease will never die in six months, like I don't know what it is like. You know, like I can't eat food that people give me like unless I really, really trust them like I can't I can't drink anything. That I don't know is for sure mine like it's it's like, even if it was a mind but i'm just I have that little bit of doubt, I won't drink that if I do i'll get I get a terrible anxiety and I don't. I don't know why it's so bad like I don't know what I don't know if it's like postpartum like after having my son like I have these visions of him, like crying out for me like this. At all like it's not so bad anymore, like, I think the medication is helping. But like I used to like almost put myself into like a depressive state by thinking of something like super negative about something bad happening that's why, like every time I come across that question on the survey. it's always usually very like all the days or whatever, because it's like like I maybe it's because of my line of work, you know what I mean or maybe it's because of like you know when I was growing up spike TV had a show called 1000 ways to die I don't know if you ever. Right sweat. So, like all the stupid ass ways, you could die I don't know that by good either you know."
214.0,Provider,I don't know.
13084.0,Patient,"I know what today, though, and I know I know that it's there and I know a lot of them are rational and like I said the medication has been helping. You know, there was a point in time, where my husband was using like liquid like research chemicals like they were benzodiazepines so you know, and he would when he was really bad like you know this was years ago before my son was born. You know, he would put it in his drinks and stuff and then he blackout and he's forget and stuff like that. And then I would be so fearful of like drinking, something that wasn't mine, but it was this from like the night before or you know what I mean. Am I I was so fearful that like something would happen to me, and then I was feeling weird. And because my anxiety obviously like I would start having like things just like panic attacks, because I would like to think that there was something in the dream and then I pretty much. stopped drinking and eating anything that I didn't eat like no way like 100% and it's like it's it's like really annoying."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but let's work with that one that one we understand why we feel that way. yeah I understand this we've conditioned ourselves to understand that there was a period in time where your husband was making an elixir and you needed to be careful about what you were doing. And what you're what you've done, though, and you've said this to me before that you're very proud of your husband of where he is today so. What you need to think about is it's okay to say if it's not mine I won't drink it I don't think there's something totally wrong with that, but I think why you identify that you need to do that it's not there anymore."
13084.0,Patient,"was like why, why is it not."
214.0,Provider,"Because you are still worried about the next shoe dropping that goes to number one. dropping dead you like things that good he's good he's clean, but you saw him pass away like you've there's some trauma here. That says, you know the past can be the future I can't get away from the future, because I know it happened in the past, like you're in two time zones. And it's hard to fluently work through them and what I would say to you is you know don't don't don't discount themselves fast, but start to save yourself so for number one for me. is about you know being dead. Every time you think about being dead, you need to think about all the times you're alive like you need to save yourself I just did this shit yesterday and today i'm still alive, because your mind is going to. allow itself to run with the fear factors that's what the mind does, but I think you need to give yourself a break to don't don't minimize it by saying. You know this stupid you've had some serious trauma that makes me understand why you feel like, then you just feel like the next shoes good job like life can't just be. unicorn and cotton candy it's got to be something black and dark coming my way, and you know, I just want to be ready for it and it's like. You don't need to be ready for anything I know why you feel you need to be ready, but. I don't think that's President, anyone, I think you just you just need to back down from it and say you know what I could get hit by the yoga truck yeah I could. But I didn't like you're not doing that part right when you get home it's about saying okay i'm home safe what I thought this morning or don't work did not happen, like you have to go back and combated with some facts or else this thing will run over and over and over and over again."
13084.0,Patient,"yeah it was like when like so it wasn't really boys like it wasn't until it was the end of his position that like certain always introduced. And then that's when I got to the point where like I was nervous of like like touching anything and then not washing my hands and my. feet up like that, like so that was like the last bit of like that whole paranoid like eating like my hands and things that I had to stuff like that, because, like. Non GMO by any means, but it's just like I was more panic just picking up something that would harm me, you know, and I mean and like. But it's just like Now I know that's really not the case, but within but then, at the same time i'm not person that like oh someone like I. would think that someone would poison 100% like and I know it sounds so like. weird but, like, I was like that's my other issue I was going to talk about that some deep seated one, but this one's from my childhood is i'm still extremely paranoid. Like when i'm out in public like i'm constantly looking over my shoulder like i'm constantly worried about like the people around me because I feel like not I don't I don't want to do it. people to get me it's not that at all I just know that people, but there are like bad people in the world and. You know I know that because, like the traumas for my step dad like him being one of those bad people that it's just like i'm. Like i'm always like aware like i'm always on my toes like not like super tense, but like I guess i'm walking on my part every day from work like i'm constantly kind of like I have to at least look over my shoulder once. You know I mean you know if I hear something or it sounds like someone's walking up behind me like. You know, or if i'm in a doctor's office or mall if someone's like behind me, I have to step aside and let them go ahead and I don't really like having people. Like walking behind me like being in an elevator with somebody that I don't know like i'm not really like about that, because I, you know what I mean like I feel like I said, like defend myself, but not necessarily. You know, in a way that I would like you know any mean and then living in California their self Defense folder ass you know what I mean so just kind of like. You know I don't know like it's just I don't know what I think I mean I know it's my step dad like I know it was from the old at. The eight years old, that you filled in your sleep and shit like that so you're constantly freezing I people are out there, you know what I mean but it's like. it's been so long and it's like dude like I want to be able to it and it used to only be at night, like i'd have to call my husband, when I was taking the trash out at work, just because I had to be on the phone with someone, but now it's like even during the day too and it's not. I don't know it is, it is every day but it's just like but it doesn't make me unhappy i'm not depressed it's just annoying you know."
214.0,Provider,"So, so what. Right, so what what it happened here what's transpired here is the parasympathetic nerve the nerve that's fight or flight is stuck on flight. And that was to conditioning, so the way we describe this is if a tiger comes out and tries to bite you the parasympathetic nervous because you've run because you can't think fast enough. The problem is, you always think that tag is going to come out and bite you so now you're always in that fight or you're hyper vigilant for like what was that who's around me. So you see a Center he is super super super sensitive. To anything right, but the idea here is like when you have to let somebody pass you by you know you don't take the time to say. You know, obviously, that person wasn't going to hurt me or i'm going to turn around, but I know nobody's done like you got to go the extra step like when you fear then tell the facts. You know i'm getting out of my car. And I am scared but i'm going to validate that once I get out of my car and I get into my job i'm safe and I walked into my job, and you say I am safe. Like if you don't do it that way you're always gonna have this hyper vigilance going on, and it can be quite annoying."
13084.0,Patient,"yeah it's just yeah it is, and like you know, thankfully, like I work in a place for like we have a bad parking lot dispensed in. And Mike, we know that the guys that work in the you know the full place in the week glass place and stuff so they mean we see each other, quite often so. I don't feel like I wouldn't have somebody to see we're kind of keep an eye out for me something like that, but it's just like I don't know like it's just like I don't trust people and it's like I hate to say that you know and."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but, but you know you you so you know you may have an implicit bias somewhere, but here's the thing I don't think the same thing with being cautious, but this is more than cautious right. Honestly right. But like how, how are you going to address it, if you don't address it, like you, you can't go around saying i'm ready to fight and you've never fought you really don't know if you can. Find. The other one I don't know why I keep running there's nothing to run from so we have to tell ourselves Okay, I know what i'm feeling. What i'm feeling is wrong, because I can see clearly no one is around me like you have to go back and tell you mine, the facts because the mines distorting the facts. yeah it's, the only way to do it really to be honest."
13084.0,Patient,"Yes, I like in group when we did that that one about you know, like identifying it's like I could I can identify it in the moment I know what's causing it, but I don't know why is continuing to cause, because I can identify it. You know what I mean so that's why that was the one that I struggled on because it was like. You know I can do the whole you know when I start to feel like i'm going to pass out like I think i've told you, before I just go look in the mirror and I can tell that my lips firm pale and then I immediately feel better like it's like a blanket is lifted and it's like. You know so it's like and then it's like you know when i'm around like when i'm walking and it's just like you know Okay, like, I obviously know I live in a nice area like i'm. Not like something like Hollywood bullshit but like I don't live in my foot, we have like we live, when my husband, I live in Florida we lived on one of the most like shitty. Like mysteriously crappy like highways and like it was. I actually missed it a lot, like the hood amenities are really nice, but we also were very like humble we weren't like rich snotty people going into the hook, you know I mean we were. And he was still actively using at the time, and it was you know we were young and now, but like, but now it's like you live in an area that's not terrible and like I work in an area that's even more like I. And I guess but it's like i'm still like I, and I remind myself down after be like better than where you are, like me, so I do that that where it's you know what I mean but it's like. When I get my car and I lost my doors it's like."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but I think I think that that's Okay, like some of the things i'm going to validate that they're fine because. You know, locking your doors and again your car is not being that's not being like safety crazy that's the world we live in."
13084.0,Patient,yeah okay. I sometimes I need. I need a I need the validation of. what's what's normal and what's okay and what's.
214.0,Provider,"Right no I like I think I think the food and the drink it makes a lot of sense to me, I think I. I will tell you I am much like that number two is I don't as soon as I get my car I lock my doors. yeah so like I I may maybe maybe what i'm going through as the same thing you're going through, but i'm looking at this. I rather be cautious. then say only because I left the door open I got my should i'm jack like I would be mad at myself so i've conditioned myself. To do things that make me feel safe now is that behavior and not good behavior maybe it could be excessive I don't think i'm excessive I think you're obsessive about like being dead. that's something about trauma, you also work in an industry where people die, and you know you've been to a lot with your husband were like. you're not sure you're really not sure that the shoes not going to job you believe it is you, you praise him, you talk very good about him, you say nothing negative about him. By thinking in the back your mind is like the ship might just happen again, I don't know how I feel about it, like it's still there, but give yourself time it took him time to change it will take time to change, you know i'm saying."
13084.0,Patient,"yeah I try to like yeah and especially with like the whole life surroundings thing like so because of this like addiction like i've been to baltimore. it's been to the tender line has been to you know places that necessarily like Richmond you know, an oakland i've been to places that you know little white girl should not well. So it's like I try to remind them and then in Florida, you know that Orlando, you know that part of Orlando wasn't very good either so it's like I said minus one so you've been in situations that are way worse than you were fine you. know, but like i'm not gonna happen it's not going to be, but I do I use that kind of like a catalyst of like baltimore."
214.0,Provider,"And you you, you have to negotiate with yourself and remind yourself okay. This is a little much or no, this is good, you know I work in a safe place, although you know I realized what isn't safe. But i'm still going to be cautious and I think just having some rationale about it, so it doesn't seem like you read the extreme men, but more you read the conservative and. You know I I will tell you that every time I get it in an elevator I don't get in an elevator till I know the elevator doors open and I don't get out of an elevator until I make sure no one's coming in the elevator that's just a. Practice I have so you know if i'm going to get jacked i'm definitely going to see before you even make one attempt to go anywhere. that's just me, is it that. Normal. I don't know I want to be safe, so like. You know. Have those validation that something's make sense if something's like you know i'm gonna have to check myself."
13084.0,Patient,i'm gonna have to check myself so.
214.0,Provider,I think that that's really good So what does October look like feel.
13084.0,Patient,I felt my it's my favorite month actually holiday Halloween my favorite holiday. Oh yeah. yeah and i'm open. My sisters here from the navy super RAD she surprised me yesterday she's been gone for six months.
214.0,Provider,OK cool. Do you think that the 20th at 7pm your time works.
13084.0,Patient,out.
214.0,Provider,"Well, the problem is that, like i'm. i'm super book. i'm fully unfortunately yeah but i've told me was I don't know what happened, but it just happened and then i'll show you the week, right after and see that that's a problem for me that week."
13084.0,Patient,"I have a question. This like this kind of plays into like my mental thing and, like my paranoia like I need like I need like a professionals, like me, like you, don't think i'm."
214.0,Provider,Not even close.
13084.0,Patient,Thank God okay okay good well cuz like you throw the word paranoid out there you.
214.0,Provider,"Go I see people. With the seat, but we, but we. words that are not accurate let's just be fair about some of the conversations by will say things like you know i'm just totally pissed off and it's like not pissed off you hurt oh yeah damn. damn I can't pay my bills. But you have money in the Bank should, yes, I had a terrible final my boss. Now you didn't you had a disagreement like we use words as if they're they're the foundation of like they justify the means and the reality is when you say paranoid, you know paranoia is. How you describe in how the definition is a two separate entities yours isn't reflective of clinical diagnosis. you're not paranoia it's hyper vigilant your hyper vigilant, meaning your awareness is more keen than most people. However, they got that way, whether you it's you smell your site you hearing just your intuition is very, very in tune, and it has it has little tolerance. Meaning you get sets off really fast, some people, and not even hyper V, the gym they don't even know what's going on around them, and they don't pay attention so you you're one into the spectrum but that's not anything to worry about."
13084.0,Patient,"Okay yeah because i've been like paranoid about that too, not that I would like not that it's like I would be like a bad thing, but I just I don't know it was like one thing I really want to be like that, like."
214.0,Provider,"The there's no concern at all, I mean that's the feeling."
13084.0,Patient,"Was awesome because, like another thing like another thing like was no weird traumatic thing, but like I don't know so we lived in Florida and. Neither daughter I knew anybody my husband and I made a friend her name is bree and she had a son, who was the same age as my son, so they were four or five, we know that. And they were really good friends like I spent time with her and like she was working she was pulling normal and like. You know, like everything was cool right like and I knew that she was bipolar schizophrenic but I knew, she was on meds right, so you know she was told like I said totally normal. And then we move she kind of started getting like weird like towards the end of US leaving just more just that not weird which is just right, I thought she was mad at me because I am i'm paranoid like that, because I don't like confrontation. And so we moved and we came back to California and then we're friends on Facebook, or whatever, and all of a sudden in 2019 or also tember her. Her what her ex boyfriend her son's Father tried to add me on Facebook, I thought that was really weird I was like well whatever i'm just not going to add them because i'm paranoid. of people and then all of a sudden his grandma tried to add me and then that you know is is step grandpa tried to ask me what's going on right, so I didn't think anything of it for a little while. And then, all of a sudden, I went to her, I think it was probably in December, maybe or January, I decided to like look at his grandma's like you know Facebook and it turned out that my son's friend passed away. Six years old right password and the whole of what happened right, so they had the funeral streaming on you know Facebook right they had to live streaming on. Like looking for free i'm like oh my gosh she must be devastated like where is she like I can't see her like you know, like, I wonder where she is like she would have been the first people to walk in like I know how it works, you know and i'm just like not seeing her to, then I like. I start I don't know if I if it was an article that I found on Facebook, or if I googled it. turns out. She took him to the lake that was it prosper that was at least live tweets We live in a mode extended stay. And she drowned. And when I found that out like I didn't take it one from a mother's perspective, how in the world, because we do that. Then too, I am like a super big like empath so it's like all I could hear in my head was crying and like screaming to his mom like and being so scared and not understanding. Why his mom that song is to trust with do this without, for my part, and then the fact that, like we were best friends like our kids play together like. What the hell like it like it literally is screwed me up like a full month I didn't process it like and then I wanted to write her. Because it's like you know because I was a boy I figured they put her on her meds and feel but Donna, something that they you can deny your meds in jail is a full time. But you don't have to take them, but then I then I felt bad like nah shouldn't writers first time like what the hell and then it's like, but then I felt bad for her, she must be devastated, because when we found out, they were so close. And it was just like it was such like a huge thing that like I didn't I don't think I process that. And that kind of all that happened and then it's like then like a year went on, and then mastered my best friend died and then my other friend died, the day after him so it was like so much death. In a mean, and it was just that one I couldn't process, I even went to my boss House because she's a mom too and i'm like how, how do you even like I was like how, how can you even. begin to start to even process that you know what I mean, how can you do that, you know what I mean so it's like I don't know that was just. Another thing that is traumatized me in like a weird way, like the. People that were your friends to turn on their own fan, you know what I mean so it's like it's just like what kind of world we live in and it's like you think you know somebody and then it's like it's just like totally throws you for like a route. Like I don't know it's just weird. I don't know I just felt like I needed to tell you that we can obviously talk about it next time. But it was just like."
214.0,Provider,"I said, I think I think what you need to remember is, and this is hard for many even as close as we get to people, even if it's family doesn't matter we don't know people. We don't know anybody's capable we don't know we don't know family secrets what happens behind closed doors right. we've either witnessing we were part of it, we know it, we all know, other people, and when we see traumatic events like this, like holy shit I know this person you really didn't. You really you know, there was a missing component that she didn't show you and yeah sure it's a terrible feeling. But like you know, there is nothing you've could have done to avoid a terrible situation if it didn't fall on you. But you know that's why I always tell people you know when you know when we're getting close to people doesn't matter close you think you are you never that close you don't know people you don't. know it takes his."
13084.0,Patient,"heart broke for him, like, I felt like oh my God like I might just be how I am i'm really sensitive person I could scream like I feel the most like a lot, you know, like pretty heavy more than normal. So it's just. Basically, sick and I think that might be a normal thing before."
214.0,Provider,you're processing another human being taken another human beings life. And it's a mother.
