13.0,Provider,"Right yeah the ibuprofen is good for the inflammation but to take ibuprofen for inflammation you have to take a lot, you have to take 600 to 800 milligrams. You only need about 200 milligrams for pain, but you need a lot more to address inflammation and a lot of people can't their stomachs or you know you can't do it forever, because your kidneys don't won't let you. But yeah for the occasional flare up. Alright, so you are in our Tuesday morning. yay yeah. What was that, like, for you, being in group."

13.0,Provider,"that's what they say for any group, you get out what you put in, so of course, that was a really different group, because I was the doctor and the therapist next time you're they're going to be there, and she she runs a tight little ship and. she'll do the behavioral health part. she's funny or two she has a great sense of humor. People tell me that I look like i'm mad all the time. Oh good i've been trying to smile. Okay. We took 24 minutes, let me just look over this make sure there's nothing else. you're on my sin a pro. And when you got that. lifted test and they told you, your cholesterol was high."
14847.0,Patient,"It was it was slightly elevated that day one, as far as my cholesterol."
13.0,Provider,"Okay, but they wanted you on the lisinopril because of the high blood pressure. And yeah. yeah yeah."
14847.0,Patient,I really. took an office job is when I got high blood pressure and i've been here 14 years so probably. 18 years something like that I don't know.

14847.0,Patient,Totally lay off my server as possible and as far as the cholesterol or the blood pressure stuff try to stay away from dairy and volunteers. Okay.
13.0,Provider,"Well, let me tell you. yeah. I love tortillas too, but I can't have the corn so i've taken to eating allman tortillas and I like them better I really surprised I like them better than the corn."
14847.0,Patient,"See i'm not a big coin or the person, but I love flowers, but this. will try to. love."
13.0,Provider,"They make they make better green now and and you might find that they give you the same taste, but they don't have the same. they're not a high carbohydrate because they're made from nuts. Instead of."
14847.0,Patient,a grain of it other thing is. never heard of that word so in milk and almond milk and all that but i've never heard those.
13.0,Provider,"You have to go to. Whole foods or a health food store I don't know if Clovis has a whole foods. yeah. The other thing that I get on I you know order from Google every month is. monk fruit mo n K it's a fruit that tastes, just like sugar, but it has no calories."
14847.0,Patient,"i've heard of it and i've seen it. Where the data or Indonesia or something, and he he gets that stuff away with it it's really good."
13.0,Provider,"yeah if you substituted your sugar for the monk fruit, you would find. Your glycemic index would go way down. So if you did those two things you would. Our night terrible you get on with me and I tell you is don't do this don't do that and change this and stop that."
14847.0,Patient,"let's take it, step by step. Okay well."
13.0,Provider,"Okay i'll get back to you on. Well, just try the guy try the guy from Indonesia telling to bring you some and you can try it in your tea or coffee or just So you see, because it's not like I mean I remember the early days of sacrifice and those other things that were horrible."
14847.0,Patient,"yeah he had a sweet taste, but I had a horrible after tasting it."
13.0,Provider,"Yes, and this doesn't this. So all right i'll let you go."
14847.0,Patient,"Oh, and that I had down here and I was gonna ask this you've got me on the eight milligrams take two steps every morning. What What if my persons with that up to like eight in the morning or late afternoon is that anything do that or that better to take it at once and keep it all day."
13.0,Provider,"yeah better to take it at once and keep it in your system, because you need to get your blood level up, you need to get that full 16 remember buprenorphine is active in your system from 36 to 72 hours in Europe, they take this medicine every other day. We take it every day you don't need to but that's how we do it. So, but splitting it up means you never get your blood level, all the way up."
14847.0,Patient,"Okay. That was my other question I didn't know and I didn't know how this works. I know I haven't really had any withdrawal or anything like that. My my take the edge off the pain, but really I didn't know the words wants a painkiller. know."
13.0,Provider,"yeah well, it does it's a very powerful pain medicine, but the thing is you've been on opioid so long. Any opioid you could be on short of stopping you from breathing and you're being unconscious and not feeling any pain, none of them are going to work, that this is why in pain management, nobody puts anyone on opioids anymore for paying for long term pain, because we know it doesn't work. It just. dependent."
14847.0,Patient,You went on dates more and more and more and more to get really. No right to a day use the word 10 years ago now it's been a year.
13.0,Provider,Now yeah. yep I wish your surgery is had helped.
14847.0,Patient,With well and. I may end up having to have another one because i've got a moment it looks like but. I will have to go back in with a neurosurgeon know that I get the more eyes and see. see what happens from here.
13.0,Provider,yeah and their bone on bone they would want to fuse it.
14847.0,Patient,"You know, really needed by rhonda stuff and I tried to get them to do that, the last time you said they're too young Tara has your back, and I said, well, I know what the guy that had a nap at night, and they swear by it was they never did but. So. Eventually i'll probably have to have that done but. Then I said oh I didn't come on."
13.0,Provider,Man yeah you want to avoid it if you can.
14847.0,Patient,"So, the reason I just did what they did last night little do, that is, because if it didn't work. I still have that ultimately didn't rod the backspace to do that. right and it worked for a while, but it's anything Dale it's. it's not good and i've got what they call it, he did it this disease is open so."
13.0,Provider,uh huh.
14847.0,Patient,And I had last night yeah.
13.0,Provider,"yep hopefully if that does happen so we're going to start tapering you down very slowly, because if you ever do need surgery again we've got to get you at that low dose so that you can take a little more buprenorphine and actually get some pain relief."
14847.0,Patient,"You know. Like. talking to my significant other today is he, like i'm glad you finally did this and. You see didn't think i'd ever quit. With a date and for two years into didn't they didn't stop taking them in so. For instance, see and just a curiosity. Somebody said, the withdrawal from this which tapering off on anything shouldn't be without the withdrawal from this to be worse than the total."
13.0,Provider,"So what's different is what they were saying is withdrawal stopping completely your coat on and completely buprenorphine yes, the buprenorphine takes a lot longer and it's more uncomfortable. But that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about one milligram per week or every two weeks, not a full withdrawal, you might get a runny nose, you might have you know some hot flashes for a day. And then your body adjusts and then you're down to a new normal so just like you had to taper up you got tolerance going up. You don't develop tolerance with buprenorphine and you can convince your body that it needs less and less by coming down very, very slowly. Anything else. Okay, now, if your partner ever wants to ask questions she's welcome you can make an appointment, for I can explain things to her that. I can just answer questions if you ever want to do that. And I think I think I might have said it in group, the other day, going to veer the therapist is a family and marriage counselor and she loves doing couple work so. If you've got any inclination that way."
14847.0,Patient,Definitely keep that in mind.
13.0,Provider,"All right, well, I think I. can't pick on you about anything else."
14847.0,Patient,Oh sure you'll find something.
13.0,Provider,Work on it.
14847.0,Patient,To do so.
13.0,Provider,"All right, take care."
14847.0,Patient,Thank you.
13.0,Provider,"bye bye. All right, I am just gonna find. What is. Jason Bennett. Not gonna leave the recording on i'm just. trying to get the. history of present illness and copy it to this new chart. I guess I could ask you to do that. didn't even occur to me. alright. street of present illness last. There we go. You can more thing from rapid accent. Okay, so. The. milligrams in. Last. hours. ready. All right. Okay, so I think this chart. ready for you fill in all the bubbles, thank you."
