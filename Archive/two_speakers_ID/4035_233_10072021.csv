4035.0,Patient,What is that I don't know what that is.
233.0,Provider,"Fair enough, so clonidine is a medication that can help out with those withdrawal symptoms. We tell people take it. Only when they have the withdrawal symptoms and usually. Just for the time that they're experiencing withdrawal symptoms it's not. A medication or a long term thing just for a brief period. When you did go from 16 to 15 milligrams how long did all of these symptoms seemed to last for you."
4035.0,Patient,Three days.

4035.0,Patient,milligram at.
233.0,Provider,The half.
4035.0,Patient,"that's good that's Okay, too."
233.0,Provider,"So that might help lessen the symptoms of course it lengthens the amount of time that one needs to be able to taper down but that's Okay, we can do that. My tendency honestly is also as we start to hit the holiday time I don't and you've heard me say this, I don't encourage a taper during the holiday time. yeah there's. Too much else going on and we launch a successful and we don't need to add stress on top of your life."
4035.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds."
233.0,Provider,"Okay, very good I also like to give January as kind of kind of a recovery time and then consider maybe in. February, looking at the paper."
