165.0,Provider,"It rings through and then, once they like, once it gets to the point where they should pick up. It just beeps once and stay like it's like a voicemail or something so i'm wondering if they're like on lunch right now. So I can try to call later, and if it doesn't work i'll just have Julie can send it electronically she I already talked to her and she just had to refill the medication so. I couldn't I can't get through, I called three times I called from different numbers and. There should be somebody picking up and there's images beeps like they sent me to voicemail or something or maybe but usually an automated system will tell you, if there's. A lunch break or something so because of that I just don't know um but I will okay so just really quickly, I have asked you two more questions any withdrawal symptoms right now."
11860.0,Patient,No.

I remember it was. Happy I remember being super crappy and different than anything else, but the vaccine. My body response to that was like pretty gnarly like I like woke up the next day, and like I couldn't touch anything even my fingertips hurt I gets painful and it gets worse before it gets better so just you know just get some get a bunch of gatorade added. It to."
11860.0,Patient,"Its rob I wasn't around him at all, but my son my oldest son plays football and they have. I think they canceled most of their beans because there's so many kids positive and then he tells me today, one of our neighbors have it and he's like oh I hang out with my first period i'm like I need to know that days ago. Except for all oh man. When he said he was like yeah he's like I thought today was Tuesday, because you know he works and then he takes care of all of us."
165.0,Provider,"Right Oh well, okay. That was weird Oh, I thought my head on my zoom left I just a window opened over it okay um so. i'm going to try to call the pharmacy again a little bit later, I think that we're we're good to go here for now and then, if you want to just. If you don't hear from me in the next I don't know like three or four hours you're welcome to check back in but any you know I i'm going to take a lunch break here soon so like probably like three or four hours would be you know a good time frame for me to try to call them again. If you get nervous otherwise i'm just going to reach out to you and send you a text when it's done. Okay okay all right. Thank you. bye. I was amber Giles. 1041 pst to 1052 pst patient is not yet missed an appointment, but she's going to miss tomorrow because she or she thinks she will miss tomorrow. she's sick with coven likely she's been she's going to get tested actively right now her last dose was this morning at 10am Eastern standard time 920 21. She still has remaining tablets on hand i'm going to indicate to the pharmacy that the patient should take the medication starting Wednesday not today so it's not an early refill. She doesn't know exactly how many tablets on hands i'm not going to document that for the patient denies relapses denies withdrawal symptoms and i'm going to call the pharmacy again later as the pharmacy was not picking a mccoll to do. stupid."
