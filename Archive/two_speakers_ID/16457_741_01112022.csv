741.0,Provider,How are you doing.
16457.0,Patient,i'm still sick.
741.0,Provider,"I still say. All right. All right. And can you turn your camera on please ma'am. Thank you, lie alright, so do you have Kobe or what."
16457.0,Patient,"Number what does it went and tested but i'm pretty sure because. Both my granddaughter's they tested positive for coded and. My son's. Well, used to be girlfriend she does supposed to productive and i've been around all of them, so."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, I you probably need to go get tested just to make sure."
16457.0,Patient,Just reading something one up my name's.
741.0,Provider,"Understand believe me i've been tested multiple times for that mess and it's not fun I usually end up crying before they're all done. yeah and but it's probably it real important um you use tobacco or nicotine right cigarettes. yeah yeah, and for that."
16457.0,Patient,Ahead booster booster.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, but still if it's a different strain than the one that you got the vaccine before. You still end up having it and. Oh. i'm. So, possibly have Kobe okay um. So what is going on with. Your UAE I."
16457.0,Patient,"don't know, I just want some energy I guess."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so. You don't have energy if you don't use math. Right okay. Okay, but that increases the length of time that it takes your neuro transmitters in your brain to level out. If you keep using it. So it's like a never ending cycle, because it if you stay away from it for a period of time and i'm not talking about a little period of time i'm talking about a long period of time. Eventually, your body will read down that the neurotransmitters in your brain will start to produce that the endorphins and. Things that you need it to produce so that you have energy and can feel. Does that make sense to you. yeah okay so as it sucks what is one of those things that we. kind of have to We just have to. get through it, you know."
16457.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,um. I would imagine that your suboxone is making kind of drowsy to.
16457.0,Patient,never made me drowsy.
741.0,Provider,"Okay okay you just you just one of those people like me that has no metabolism, and we have no get giddy up and go. I that that that I think the only cure for that is to stay away from the mass so that your body can start producing those chemicals on its own. To make sure that you get plenty of rest at night, are you sleeping okay at night."
16457.0,Patient,um yeah.
741.0,Provider,Okay. Are you getting eight hours of sleep.
16457.0,Patient,know.

741.0,Provider,"Okay, what."
16457.0,Patient,happens what happened is. I have a job bladder and I feel like I gotta go come in here and sit on the toilet and end up falling asleep on the toilet and then yeah I have a pretty rough.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and I, so you get about five hours of sleep. What. It would be nice if we get add about three hours to that. mmm. hmm. I have to think of some stuff. I don't know I don't know how because if you fall asleep on the potty. that's not very comfortable. And it's real disrupted, so you probably really need to add."
16457.0,Patient,makes my foots well and.
741.0,Provider,"yeah right yeah and then all of your leg the muscles and nerves in your legs. go to sleep. yeah and then it's hard to walk when it's time to get back to the base. I know. i've been there. um alright, so are you eating well, are you eating a balanced meal."
16457.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, what are you doing there."
16457.0,Patient,Well i'm just. A snack.
741.0,Provider,"snack or. yep okay and. Okay, I eat fruits and vegetables."
16457.0,Patient,vegetables fruits.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, nobody you, like me, another big veggie like are either. Okay hmm. Can you eat a salad for lunch. That will get some vegetables in you. Actually, what I do and just to show you i'm sitting here with my snacks. And I have. I have some carrots carrots, I only got one carrot today as i'm celery sticks. And I went to the store and I bought some hummus."
16457.0,Patient,i'm.
741.0,Provider,"just trying hummus and I did. them celery sticks in the hammock. This is the protein, and this is the vegetable. But that it works. And it gives me the cracks i'm not eating a bunch of chips. But when we when we get off drugs and and stuff, we have to start changing the way we eat, too, because when you were after doing the drugs, we garbage we just eat junk food."
16457.0,Patient,This is.
741.0,Provider,"If we eat it all and. Our body in order for it to repair itself has to have the nutrients in the proteins and the vegetables and the fruits and. I know it's difficult and I know it's expensive to eat that way to eat just fruits and vegetables and meat but. The stuff that they put in all the pre packaged foods is a bunch of chemicals that's not good for you, that really messes up your whole body. That processed food, if you can't pronounce it and don't know what it is, you probably shouldn't eat it. You know what I mean. yeah uh huh and i'm not perfect don't get me wrong because I still drink my monsters, and I drink the ones that that have zero sugar in them which means i'm drinking this stuff called tiring which I don't have any idea what it is, so I shouldn't be drinking it. But I drink one of these two cups of coffee and the rest of the day I drink water, I see it as I drink."
16457.0,Patient,Sugar water.
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16457.0,Patient,The. is just a little bit. of sugar in it just to take give it a taste.
741.0,Provider,"Try putting. like pieces of Orange like I take an orange and slice it and then i'll stick that orange slice in my water. I shove, it down in the bottle so there's a little orange juice in the bottle of water, you know. every once in a while take a great kind of open and second stick it in there."
16457.0,Patient,We ever had the cotton candy grapes yes. hi yeah they got caught between the grapes.
741.0,Provider,"hi okay. Okay So what are we going to do. To um. To get you. And why you're in a place where when that urge comes up, you can say no."
16457.0,Patient,that's hard but i'm telling you i'm i'm building it.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, I know I know it's frustrating and it's difficult and it feels like we're asking you to do all the stuff. At one time. And, as I know, for me it was really overwhelming when I first got clean to have to think about all this mess about eating right and doing this and doing that and. It was crazy. yeah my opinion. I met you know it's like how am I supposed to do all this mess I can't even have to get out the bed, because I had no energy. um. So I know that parts of struggle and I I understand it. But what we have to put one foot in front of the other and are you experiencing any. Any depression and, if so, are you receiving any medication for depression."
16457.0,Patient,"Okay, the name of it. Not so much. Yes, Malta."
741.0,Provider,"Okay okay. All right, and does it help."
16457.0,Patient,It used to. That I don't think it's not the more.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, do you see a psychiatrist. No, no Okay, what are we getting that."
16457.0,Patient,The doctor.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, you need to tell your doctor they don't work, no more and you need something else. And they need something that's not going to put you to sleep. um. Does your doctor know that you're that you're trying to get clean. yeah okay okay. and So honestly. We need to get some work done, we need to figure out how to help you. Stay strong. And not you. So that we can get past this hump. Can you make an appointment to see your doctor and get tested for the colby and take care of your. Inside the person. yeah Okay, can you do that before like call in at least make the appointment before next week. yeah okay all right so you're going to call and make an appointment. With your doctor. Okay, so there's one thing that we're going to do. And, did you ever come up with a like a schedule of of what you're going to do when."
16457.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"No okay that's The second thing I want you to do I want you to build yourself don't make it really packed or anything just build yourself a schedule what time you're going to get up what time you're going to go to bed. And charla allow 989 hours, so that you can sleep as much as possible during that time. And, but what time you're going to get up what time you're going to go to bed what time you going to eat your meals, maybe even what time you're good plan your snacks. So that you're not eat just grazing all day long platinum plan a breakfast and a snack and a lunch and a snack and have dinner and a snack before you go to bed."
16457.0,Patient,Does that make sense yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and so, if you plan out your that and then around those times you can put in stuff like laundry or. or I don't know what what you do to occupy your time and. No clean house or whatever it is, you know. play with the grandkids I know you do that. And so those types of things you'll want to put in to your you want to allow time for all of those things. In your schedule okay. Okay. So you're gonna build a schedule. And then you're gonna try to follow it. that's gonna be the fun part right. The one thing that you want to. I want, I want you to have your schedule built my next week okay. And then next week, we can start trying to follow it. Okay. and alright. So I want you to tell me, I know. That i've asked you this before, but I need to ask again because I didn't write it down the last time, what is your goal for treatment. What do you want to accomplish by coming to bright heart health and and do one treatment."
16457.0,Patient,To get clean.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. So whatever that takes. We got we got to figure out what that's going to take to get you clean right. yeah okay So the first thing that we got to do, obviously, is take them as. As prescribed. and Dr Z nice already messaged me and said that he will go ahead and send your medicine. um. let's see okay so we're going to take the meds us as prescribed we got to stay in compliance, obviously. and So that means we gotta remember to take all those silly surveys and do, are you a total group that's something else you need to put in your schedule group time. And then also. Try to put in like. Our appointment, or something you know. let's see. So stay in compliance, we have to. Take surveys. and Andrew. What do you do pretty good.

And, and she realizes that she needs to take her medication as prescribed and she needs to stay in compliance by taking the surveys and do her uds attending group and attending. Individual sessions, and she is she has been struggling with. Using periodically in the last month or two, and she has been tested positive for math and also for. Some fat no and so she's even struggling with her, even though she's on suboxone she's still struggling with withdrawal, but i'm not sure that she understands or realizes that some of what she was experiencing as a withdrawal. But this week we gave her. Three chores to do, and one of them is to call and make an appointment to see her doctor and the next one, is to start working on a schedule. And the other one is to make a list of things that she enjoys doing. And so, hopefully and she's supposed to do all of this by our next appointment, which is on the at our one. So hopefully she will get that stuff done, I know she's struggling she has low energy she has. Medical issues, so I understand she's really having a hard time right now. So. um anyway, if you could get that down for me, I would appreciate it, thank you."
