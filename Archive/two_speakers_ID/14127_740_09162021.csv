14127.0,Patient,On.
740.0,Provider,The bottom from my bed my video.
14127.0,Patient,let's see here i'm gonna. mute start video okay yo yo yo.
740.0,Provider,"perfect. alright. So we're gonna jump right into it, because. it's not on our side. So today we're going to do some worry exploration questions because I want to continue to get down to the root of your worry. So we're going to do it talks about what could happen versus what will happen. And a lot of times when we when we worry we worry about things that could happen, even though we're not there yet."
14127.0,Patient,Right correct.
740.0,Provider,"And so that can be the root cause of I worry and that's The thing that we battle with the most a lot of times people get up or they go through or. foo. Manchu prohibits them from moving forward. I worry the most about well if I do this, and this could happen if I do this, and this could happen if I do that so basically it kind of restraint you. kind of restrict you from moving forward, so this is when you all worried about something is agency imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen. So how often does it happen to you, Miss Miller, when you were you worried about something How often do you do you imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen. Okay. And when you imagine those things like we imagine that those things. What does it do to you."
14127.0,Patient,"It causes me to talk out loud I talked to myself a lot and I don't realize i'm doing my kids and my wife, which is another reason they suggested that I seek help because i'll have a full on conversation with myself. You know answering myself like that, like there's like there's i'm talking to somebody like there's two people. And and. And sometimes I get loud about it and they noticed that a lot of the car worm worms you know this space out. And then, will yell at me hey dad you know stuff that, then I like snap back to reality. And the right, I do just that, with the coronavirus I wear this mask me sorry he's here."
740.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14127.0,Patient,"But it's it's it's it's not physically and then I just get this this like this tingling feeling all of my body like. I know I know it's five blood pressures going up through the roof, you know because i'm i'm i'm like that's the scenario that hasn't happened or hasn't hasn't happened yet, you know it's like you said worry about things are going to happen, the future. hmm i'm scared I I honestly am scared."
740.0,Provider,"So the question that I have for you is this what what what what what the Why is it, why do you think it's so hard for you to release control."
14127.0,Patient,"Because i've never been in this situation before I call it was fixed now physically I can't fix it because my brain says hey you think you're going to work my my body's telling me a different story, you know you're buying these are just shot you. know my eyesight Why is it, am I right I got very limited. aside because of a Retinal detachment know had surgery if they said, this is always going to be the rest of your life and I can't try it's it's. A can try, are you kidding you know be driving since I was 18 years old, you know. But it's those my my right is throw this by depth perception off."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14127.0,Patient,And I gotta Be careful stairs I gotta be careful with a lot of things I trip and fall a lot so.
740.0,Provider,"So. Did you ever and. I remember this conversation, did you ever get to call the unemployment office. To see if you qualify after you get off the disability."
14127.0,Patient,or once you get off civility the doctor has to write a note and say you can go back to work.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14127.0,Patient,"And then you can collect unemployment. Okay, if he can, if he won't because i'm not."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, and so it looks like a he may be able to feel a little like looks like you may be able to claim disability, a little while longer."
14127.0,Patient,I don't know if to extend the. Temporary disability or not that's something I would have to look into.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, I remember, you said that he went all the way to November I think it's like my bed."
14127.0,Patient,"Yes, that's right you're absolutely right, thank you."
740.0,Provider,"So i've know they're financially, that is a huge thing. For. me and i've provided so they home. that's funny now so when you used to providing for so many decades. For your home, you know, can be a huge it can be a crippling type fear."
14127.0,Patient,Right i've seen it i've seen it before i've seen it in my own home.
740.0,Provider,"So I know that it's real fast before me and. However. I would, I would, unless I really want to go through these because a lot of time to keep yourself from anxiety from severe. Panic attacks and fears and things like there's a lot of times, you have to practice staying in the present. Saying what's happening right now. And when your brain wants to go there you got to pull yourself, but you got to put yourself back, I see my thing is like this there's nothing wrong with having to yourself. They said, as long as you're not answering you say. We just bought from us, but at the same time self talk isn't always bad it just I guess is the theme of Hamlet you talk to yourself that probably they probably. Were was your family. But self talk is also it's a coping skill, however. Instead of talking what are some of the things that you say to them, do you do you remember the things that you say to yourself, when you have oh."
14127.0,Patient,"I don't and that's funny say that I don't know I I know basically or. I know what I want to crux of it is, I know what i'm but to tell you I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"Okay okay. So basically it's been able to just one of the things that we have to get out, but I really want you to work on is pulling yourself back to pull yourself back to the process. Where Am I right now currently right now on here currently right now my family is safe, right now, my my I have, I still have a roof over my head. Right now for already have that many deals behind right now we still got money coming in, right now, they got. paycheck coming in, right now, my wife is still doing good right now we're still able to eat right now the life of feeling so those type of thing saying in the prison. Okay, that makes it. Because it says, in reality, these worries that we have it may never come true."
14127.0,Patient,"you're absolutely right, it may not."
740.0,Provider,"It. May. about you, is there, what happens when it works out and then, when it's been months and months and months, where you got it you got going on what i've got a headache been going on for the past 30 days. And all this kind of stuff and then we look down the road. When it actually works out and live back you're like whoa that's your bed about."
14127.0,Patient,Right and.
740.0,Provider,So that so sometimes these words my neighbor comes through it says what could happen isn't the same as what will happen.
14127.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"You have you have to be able to decide to the different. Because when we when we when we. Think about what could happen what it is, but now we start to speculate we start to assume. So this another thing that I would challenge you to do with Mila when you begin to assume extra sale what's the evidence."
14127.0,Patient,what's the evidence.
740.0,Provider,writer day every day.
14127.0,Patient,Okay yeah yeah. Right.
740.0,Provider,"Right what's the evidence the back of your assumption and it's in a moment, if you don't have no evidence. Then, that means that you have to actually is my assumption really. really true. Or is it just my imagination."
14127.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. see what you're saying I understand what you're saying, but then, on the other hand, what if I don't you know. I say this it's silly. But if I don't worry, which is just silly. And, and you know it does happen, it does have some of what I was inevitable actually acids, I mean you know there's that side of it too that's that's the side I can't let go off."
740.0,Provider,You know they used to have the same as soon as they don't count your chickens before they hatch.
14127.0,Patient,Right sure.
740.0,Provider,And they need to have another thing to say don't put the care and for the whole. Right right.
14127.0,Patient,So the thing about it is.
740.0,Provider,"And this is what you have to listen, what you have to do and I encourage you to do this because not only is your mental health affected, but also your physical health is a fantastic."
14127.0,Patient,"Yes, it is."
740.0,Provider,And so we're very severely like that it messes with you physically.
14127.0,Patient,As.
740.0,Provider,A deprives it depletes your energy right and. It puts you in a stagnant place physically so. To the point to where sometimes you can work with so much to where it can cause it can cause physical pain.
14127.0,Patient,It does. Yes.
740.0,Provider,So the thing about it is if it does happen down the road you'll never know until you get there.
14127.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"So if know you're saying a bad idea of. The idea of. Well, what if I don't wear it and it ended it happen okay. we'll we'll take care of it when we get there. But the thing about it is, is that we're trying to make sure, did you get the lay of 50 something happen."
14127.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Would you worry and constantly about something that you haven't even seen yet that you don't even know if this thing will actually happen if it won't happen if it's a figment of my imagination is part of my reality we don't know any of these things. You know i'm saying, but what it is doing is that it's tearing you down physically."
14127.0,Patient,"Yes, it is."
740.0,Provider,"To the point to where we want to make sure you get this thing up. So, in order for that to happen, we have to be able to practice, these coping mechanisms of being able to stay in the present. Being able to acknowledge what I have right now. Okay. Okay, so. So, Dan here says thinking about what will happen, it says, instead of think about what will happen. Instead of what could happen, can you can't know can help you where he lives, it says whenever you start to wear it answer these questions, all right, he got the first question, what are some clue that you're aware, we will not come true."
14127.0,Patient,"Are some clues that my worry when I come true. hmm well if they want they want me on my doctor says your turn you need to go from the disability. hmm and our I was hoping is that once this ends that look chicken. mm hmm and and that's fine. Whatever evidence or things. That could have a well that proves that i've got is i'm seeing my what my wife has bounced through trying to get on from the disability yeah she's younger than me she's. Six years younger than me and she's been trying to get on disability from is for the for the last five years Okay, and I had an uncle who will try to get a permanent disability will take him months and months and months, so the clues that I have are. My uncle and my and my wife. What they've gone through to to perfectly civilized, on the other hand. A gentleman who I worked with and he's working on the same age. He had a heart. problem was heart and for work caused it and that's Another thing I."
740.0,Provider,was worried.
14127.0,Patient,"Because it's hard to really it hurt and he got on on disability quickly you know they question you know I use it wrong with you, you can't work anymore, we don't pretend disability. They didn't he didn't even go before a magistrate you say just wrote it off, and he started getting from the disability so there's a clue that it does work, the system does work. You know. And so that's what I hang on to you know I got the same returned he had he gave me the number, I said okay and and so it's it's on this way it's it's six have been done. But the clue that I have that the clues you know my wife my own thoughts are and then there's this gentleman who I went to work with, I saw I don't know you know there's conflict conflict ratings in me right. And then it's a problem that causes itself to where you have conflict yesterday overdoses. in that city like here's what to buy me a dog so."
740.0,Provider,"The thing about it is. Is a lot of time I see i'm not gonna i'm not gonna speak again, you talking to you. Sometimes you gotta sell things that."
14127.0,Patient,You throw yourself.
740.0,Provider,"Time it's really and I have a whole conversation i'm blaming. God, I say you know what i'm just talking to God, even though."
14127.0,Patient,i'm glad to hear you say that because the Lord is real happy with me. he's always been with me since I was a kid. So. i'll get an answer.
740.0,Provider,"But it doesn't mean that you crazy that's not what they mean is that a lot of times, you have to have an outlet. to release some of the strength to release some of the worry and invest you talking to yourself with talking things through a talking things out, you know i'm saying, sometimes a lot of times, you have to keep you have to transfer things from your brain to out of your mouth. Let me talk to bring out it don't don't don't mean that you're hearing things now the kind of stuff that's what they mean because self talk is a very, very prominent coping skill that a lot of people you."
14127.0,Patient,Okay that's good to hear. Right.
740.0,Provider,"you're right we use it i've been in this field for alarm, for a long time. And one of the calls that people say all the time that I have seen, be a bit that I have noticed as a pattern if. You don't say, and this is something sometimes you have to talk it out each because if you don't talk it out, if you don't feel comfortable talking talking it out with somebody at least you're able to talk and I would say."
14127.0,Patient,"Well it's like bottled up inside. It talks about it. But that's where you come into play, right now, you know I said to myself i'm. talking to somebody you get the feedback. bottles up inside of you at all."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
14127.0,Patient,"I mean yeah. Like a like a like a wound up spring. You know, and I mean yeah and and yeah that's what I didn't like kids and my wife and that's another real that's. The reason they said you. Talk to somebody."
740.0,Provider,on it. And the thing about him if he is that alone can only hold so much water.
14127.0,Patient,that's right.
740.0,Provider,"If so, we so we have a clue right now we're kind of hanging in the balance, because we've seen there for some people, it took too long for this way to come through, but then for some movement for another individual it didn't take long at all there's an immediate for right now Hello okay. Well i've seen i've seen this side of the spectrum and i've seen this side of the spectrum. And so, and then I know you know it can be hard and it can be challenging trying to figure out okay so where where do I come in in this picture, am I going to be on the left side or my vm the other right. Am I going to be like my wife, does it take so long or am I going to be like my my partner they're Okay, with their their time immediately and i've seen this issue before, because even my even somebody that I knew they they. They are took birth to an extended period of time right, but once there's was approved, they gave them bad pay for the word."
14127.0,Patient,Right all right.
740.0,Provider,"So he got like two years, once the back. Because because, because the job is why would this should have been approved. And everything was tired food young saying that didn't approve it."
14127.0,Patient,that's right.
740.0,Provider,"yeah when he went. yeah when we before a new challenge. But you know it was it was apologetic you know things like that, because he wasn't able to work yeah spinal surgery. And so that was it, but what they didn't do they rewarded him back pain, but he got two years worth of bed take. That away. And then he started getting his disability every month it's not the full lifetime and he's been doing it for years, and so, sometimes even in the waiting, you can see, you get a reward after you wake. up."
14127.0,Patient,"Between the waiting part. Now you brought up a very good thing yeah. Between but but between the waiting for the two years of waiting in some homeless, you can. You know that's up to us a long time to wait."
740.0,Provider,Absolutely.
14127.0,Patient,"I go down, you know. there's some Sir. Is it, so I have a concert that you know."
740.0,Provider,yeah I don't want.
14127.0,Patient,To call with someone.
740.0,Provider,"And I think because of the your actual certain thing you know i'm leaning more toward and my engine when I when I say sorry it wasn't me boy who to make you were more. But I said in regards to of course i've seen it from the left side to with your wife situation all that kind of stuff but then i've also i've got you know i'm saying you also swinging from the other side, where people have got a nice day. And so there you know i'm saying you don't. You don't, the only thing you can do is to help. Answer answer keep yourself grounded. Until you know for sure. that's all literally all you can do, because what a happy is you don't end up like your friend gotham be with these hot conditions and because issue because of the fact that you didn't wherever Joe said almost to death."
14127.0,Patient,Right right.
740.0,Provider,"You know, and the thing about it was good enough to actually qualify to get the disability and not be around to actually use."
14127.0,Patient,"It yeah you're right. you're fine you're fine for 10. Now, on the other, that one side that one side you know where if it doesn't go well for me then wonder why you know I, the only thing I can think of, is trying to get a job, I mean you know you're going to Eric you just have to go out by two bullet involved try to. be something trying to. You know, you know bluff your way through it and then, when you get in there just do the best you can to keep the job as long as you can browse from job to job."
740.0,Provider,"done, I would say. You have adapted to if you say that you're eligible to work then then write a script and go ahead and faffing around employment."
14127.0,Patient,Oh yeah. yeah we do. know why are we.
740.0,Provider,Here we go now we go now we.
14127.0,Patient,"See is here, so it works."
740.0,Provider,"I mean that's a recipe in. And the thing about it is you i'm saying at the end of the day, you have to be able to and and I understand the worry. And the worry of a force you know i'm saying you and your wife y'all have you both been in your old age and you're not being able to have to really provide like you used to that's better. that's challenging. However. At the same time you never know. What could happen you never know what miracle may take place you never know how it may work on your face you never know. And so. So to worry, you know i'm saying so worried, to the extent to where it's pulling on us physically mentally. Emotionally your. mapping and people. And UK I mean the thing about this is that the people, the people that are there that could help you you won't push them away because because you can happen if I could you so what."
14127.0,Patient,"Can I do, that I just."
740.0,Provider,"yeah and. yeah and the thing about it is you won't need to people know. You may need to pay it out, no you never know when the way because you just never know. And the thing about it is. If they I was going to actually. Have you how do you feel if i'm a. 62 okay so i'm patient don't kick you to 65. Right right so even even with that. i'm now I would. I would. I would never suggest is something that you work so hard, however, we are pushed from the shallows what I have learned that you can pull in a Bamboo."
14127.0,Patient,"yeah you're right you're right and i've got in the work already have to my attorney they're going to file for all that stuff. If I get approved that 62 and they they start i'm coming. To get full you won't get i'll get them out, we get if I returned to 65 or 67 or whatever, but during the day they can approve, you can they do that you know and here's Another thing I have made sure that I know i'm Okay, I have a 401k. And I have my eye on yeah yeah. But he can't take out of that 41 K, while you're on disability or temporary disability, because it shows you have an income taxable income right and then then that's where they'll they'll cancel you out on non government programs, because you have a taxable income I can't. Really touch that top 65 okay and and and, believe me, that's what I want to do is for 13 sit there and girl, you know leave it alone you don't put it on me so at 65 i'll be fine right I got three years between our two and a half years but."
740.0,Provider,"So. That means we have we have some options, though. The options here is that, even though, even though you have a 401k but you still have the ancient they shoot for early so that means you can feel the pinch and early it's early in the fall one came there to develop entry. You can also like I said, if the doctor she has the right to the script and say what he's capable of working and you're not able to work go ahead and have unemployment and get checked that way, or they may leave you to be fully disable and. interact road in a. row you got you got some good options."
14127.0,Patient,"yeah I do I do as well it's just that, if it holds hands."
740.0,Provider,yeah but the thing about it is miss miss me is that you have three options. So that means one of these data work. kobe's. alum canker bad if you want to do you got to work.
14127.0,Patient,For business or you're. One of the best.
740.0,Provider,"You got three options. it'll be different if you only have one option one option oh. it'd be different it's really if you did not prepare if you did not prepare all these years of work in all these decades have been employed. If you if you were careless with your money and that you didn't invest long time, but you want the kayla's which are many a you did in this long term. Because, because you do have that both of those investments set up. You don't say that means hey at the end of the day, even if I don't want to take it out, even if I mean it's not my first choice and take it out, but at the same time, just in case I do have a phone available. You don't say it may be, it may, it may be passed to respect that call it the same person you're saying, but at the same time you're saying you have a pair and there, and you do have options. And so, when you begin to worry and you begin to feel they're saying put it in your chest and bring it about all these things it first. I need you to ground yourself, I need you to be able to stay present in the here and now this the best, the first thing to grab yourself and to stay present and the here and now and then, secondly, you have to understand that you have options. Right something's gotta work. You know i'm saying that's what they faced seeking some data work. i'm not doing all the talking for nothing. For me to hear me. Somebody hear me and so i'm gonna work. i'm saying. And I mean I mean I just believe that to be true you don't say like, even if I you know even with my own, you know and i'll share this experience with us my fail young sin before I went when I was on maternity leave. When I was on maternity leave you don't feel I felt the pool you insensitive to to. To to kind of pick up my office right. I didn't know where I was going to mute I didn't know where I was going I don't know what I would say to all our all our new was after I just walked into. My office, and so I would definitely, this is actually what I did. And once I had my baby I you know, I was like I don't want to go back to work, you know I mean I don't want to go back to work in an office job because he takes care of my chat. I pay for my maybe in daycare because code is too high, you know data has been shut down as the right because people just positive appropriate my major so Luna I don't want my baby to die young stance on my what options do I hey so the thing about it is, if you know I could have worried. and honestly in the night that will, I was told, but at the same time, you have to be able to understand that hey when it when you got when they're fake kp boom. you're saying. Your face can overcome worry. And guess what happens in the ninth hour. Of you waiting for me to go back to my other job it was Okay, I said, I have to go back to my office job they're fine. If that's the way they have to have it that's cool i'm okay with it even I didn't I didn't desire to, but at the same time it definitely I gotta do this I gotta do for my family. Right uh, but it is, but it didn't work out that way because of the fact that you know I believe in something great. there's nothing would happen that the ocean that I feel it's a pack of my office wasn't disconnected. Right and if you see i'm saying. So I found that encourage you to let you know. Listen you the thing about it is, is that you, you have to be able to see what could the the positive interface even all things look crazy, even though things the real negative, but then, at the same time you like look you got to get better because I haven't I know for a fact that. Some way somehow something we'll have to come through for me. Right. And then the thing about it is don't look at what is he does. Well, if we don't. we're not doing it. say you have the presence and right now in the prison after you got six coming in, right now, in the prison, I still got a roof over my head. My wife is happy she's doing fine. i'm lucky i'm doing fine neither cat hair colby we feel stronger we're taking the key is to do and I write your own set of a cigar food I figure out what I feel like i'm still in my right mind so as of right now. we're doing all right. And you have to really take it one day at a time, literally."
14127.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,You gotta try to one day at a time.
14127.0,Patient,You have some you just have to.
740.0,Provider,"Because I don't want to get a cow or miss women's movement in a hospital what know you got to take it one day at a time because, believe it or not, your wife need you."
14127.0,Patient,Right right. Right.
740.0,Provider,yeah maybe just. Imagine my mother.
14127.0,Patient,"same here. As much as I argue as urgent matter if she died, you know i'd be dead in three months kids."
740.0,Provider,"And if they so. The thing about it that here's another question, it says if you're worried that come true. How will you handle it and we'll you'll eventually be okay."
14127.0,Patient,"Or you have to. You know I don't have a choice you know. homeless, after all these years. Working and. i'm not there ain't just ain't no way you can you do what you gotta do you do what you gotta do. You know and hearing myself say that yeah yes you're right, you know, like you said, I have three options. that's that's pretty good advice that's that's that's pretty good. that's pretty good."
740.0,Provider,"it's true and a lot of times, you have to look at the options that you do hey instead of focusing on the things that you don't. have to kick it to continue to keep your mind in a positive state, because the thing about it is, is that if you thinking negative that it will literally. And this is why I keep telling you if you continue to think negatively or look at the worst possible option you don't think it will pull on you physically spell it will deplete your energy it will make. yeah.
