386.0,Provider,"Right now. In ventura county, it is extremely did I have family in ventura ventura actual and it is there's. there's so much stuff going on right now that it there's there's like nobody out there. um which is. really hard, but if you need resources to be able to find someone like in person definitely just reach out to our care navigation team, and we can get some resources for you, if we need to. Okay okay. Absolutely that's what we're here for that we want to be able to support you 100% of the way."
14352.0,Patient,Right okay.
386.0,Provider,let's take a look here so 1211 they cancelled the appointment for tomorrow that group because of that transition. What I will do for the tree lift or are you having to pay for any of that medication out of pocket.
14352.0,Patient,"No, just like five bucks five bucks for like six bucks for the circle something like that it's really cheap."
386.0,Provider,Okay 1234. What i'm gonna do is i'm going to send in a three day supply of the trailer for you and that's just to get you under sharing it with it it'll still be under sharon's name it'll be a three day supply just to get you to covered until you see Dr Allah Dag.

386.0,Provider,"Actually i'm going to send in a full i'm going to send into four days supply, just to be on the safe."
14352.0,Patient,side and.
386.0,Provider,"Just know that we haven't seen you since early November and so after this prescription order if you're not seen by Dr our dads that I wouldn't be able to supply another bridge for you, it, this would be. Basically what i'd be able to do for yes okay um let's take a look here, do you think you do feel like the triple does help, though."
14352.0,Patient,"It does help, and also to like I just feel like just kind of knowing myself and trying to go into like my. Old good habits to like you know start drawing and move my body around workout and stuff like that has been really helpful and I just feel like because I was taking one in the morning in to try out all. night and I got it down to one in the morning, one in the afternoon, so I want to like slowly cut down, so I don't want to. I mean meds are good for you, I guess, I don't want to rely on them by Hawaii for anything like that, because I know families on pills, so I know. I know how to like you know I know my body, so I just want to you know go down and i've worked for testing i've been doing a lot better, you should I talk pretty fast and i'm so sorry. I do this evening i'm doing a lot better and now that i'm working again and actually like you know being. Out of society or whatever I feel a lot better, so I feel like one in the morning is good and then my seroquel nice good, so I just want to like slowly put down that's why I wanted to go from 400 to 300 milligrams my seroquel. Okay, you don't want to rely on it."
386.0,Provider,"yeah so and that's perfectly fine definitely talk to Dr ella Dag about it when you see her. 11th she would be more i'm guarantee you should be more than open to adjusting now. Okay don't go on, I know you know your body ever you know I know my own body and i'm. i'm pretty much the same way I don't I don't do pills it's just not my thing. My husband tells me he's like if you have a headache take some ibuprofen I don't want to. I don't want it yeah i'll find this off myself i'll be perfectly fine um so I completely understand where you're coming from in that sense. But I know that when you're tapering one you have to give it a little bit of time for you to start tapering something else, because when there's too much going on at once, then. It can feel like there's so much pressure on you to taper these down and it's not necessary to do it all, at one time so definitely just take your time doing it and that's. What we can do for you um I will definitely get this called in, for you, I have your phone number rosie at 805501687 to. Correct you got it is a text message Okay, once the prescriptions consenting."
