724.0,Provider,"um yeah I don't really have any any solutions on how you get the ID squared away, though."
2692.0,Patient,I see me I just got a. hard to get that motivated. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So, you said you you you use the again as a result of the incident to correct."
2692.0,Patient,To what.
724.0,Provider,You said you used again that you had a relapse.

I had a couple hits up and oxy right now that's pretty big and willows I don't know why that's becoming a thing, but it's so thing and willows right now is smoking axes. anybody's doing it it's like the new heroin, I guess, I don't know it's weird i've never experienced anything like that never mess around with tools like that or anything but somebody came over that was smoking and just update my face so."
724.0,Provider,A positive that it's offseason not.
2692.0,Patient,Great I get this stumped with betting on.
724.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah to seem. Like a universal precautions that everything that you're getting anybody gets you know, on the streets that they think it's a pill it's probably fentanyl you'd be very, very safe for."
2692.0,Patient,"me so that's that's the rumor is that their press with mental so they're very strong. You never know how strong you're going to get so it's pretty i'm pretty sure it's been all. I like I said, everybody was doing it, so it kind of got shoved in my face right after that it was like I probably would have anything at that point, you know."
724.0,Provider,"So, whether the weather the assault happened like over the years weekend or."
2692.0,Patient,I was a couple weeks back.
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah. When was the last time you took suboxone.
2692.0,Patient,Last week.
724.0,Provider,"And how did you get last week, did you have. A scratch yours."
2692.0,Patient,"yeah well cuz sometimes when i'm. Like oh i'll have like i'll take to take to for the day or whatever. And sometimes i'm a couple extra. I like to do that, actually, just in case like I can't eat to the pharmacy or something happens I have that one or two honestly, but so I had like one or two. Be has been actually quite a while, since I have my spots around honestly. And then she's supposed to be give me some nighters to which is going to be nice."
724.0,Provider,No so did you speak with chantel.
2692.0,Patient,I did yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so she's she's caught up on the whole thing. Well, obviously. yeah i'm sorry that that's that's South avenue it's it's terrible nobody deserves a for sure. For sure. And I don't really have. You know the words. To express how i'll sorry I am and then I have no idea like what you must be feeling like I can't even pretend like I know what you're doing going through. So how are you coping."
2692.0,Patient,i'm not i'm trying to just forget about it. So I am. I cope with everything honestly anything a trauma happens only way that it gets out as to my nightmares I tell you what those are more horrifying I think sometimes in the actual event. A nightmare is a pretty bad and the very vivid one.
724.0,Provider,"Do you have any any strategies like before you go to bed, do you try to do something like. Like progressive muscle. exercises anything like that kind of like relax to stress in your body or anything like that. You know. They have Apps like on the phone or, like you, like they have like guided meditation things. That you can do look at YouTube you can watch a video and they'll kind of like talk you through where it's like unlocking stress like in your. it'd be like all right, like clench your hands I release them and it's all like very spoken such a tone that it naturally kind of relaxes you, I think it would. Potentially help you know if you did some of these things before bed, you know or the night terrors every every night or."
2692.0,Patient,"yeah unless it depends it like. If I haven't really super deep sleep, then I don't dream you don't mean but most the time I dream and that's one of their. Their nights for the worst and others it all depends on the dream also you know, and because of that they've been more."
724.0,Provider,Now if you've always had night terrors or.
2692.0,Patient,"No. I went through ledge llama before. And all sudden they started appearing, for an excellent so it's almost like my mind couldn't deal with anything anymore so then that just kind of started popping out and they started getting worse and worse every time I went through something. Like the first time or second time ever experienced that I was with you guys and I slept come in the grid for like a month because my phone blew up and then because of nightmares I couldn't function or talk to anybody, so I actually couldn't concrete for like a month."
724.0,Provider,"All right, she said she's going to prescribe medication for you."
2692.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But again, like getting getting to pharmacy to pick up is kind of. kind of difficult right."
2692.0,Patient,yeah just to pay with that whole ID thing after relying on other people and that's always complicated what.
724.0,Provider,"Do you try go on the bed, like the same time, every night, do you have like a nighttime routine."
2692.0,Patient,"I did, but I kind of had i'm staying with somebody right now well he staying with me, honestly, because he has nowhere to go he's kind of family and his schedule so screwed up."
724.0,Provider,"So that's disruptive. how's it disrupted, for you."
2692.0,Patient,Because he's loud he stays up most the night sleep today.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's not helpful. Have you had a conversation with him about being a little bit more mindful."
2692.0,Patient,yeah i've had a conversation with them about you know if he's got a series got to contribute contribute to and he hasn't so.
724.0,Provider,And you're allowing this to continue because of set some sense of family commitment.
2692.0,Patient,That and honestly I kind of get a conquered ladies here.
724.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, perhaps revisit that conversation with him, does he have a car. No, no, so he doesn't work."
2692.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,So he literally just. yeah occupying space in your House yeah I think the only.
2692.0,Patient,"thing is i'm oh no he hasn't even done that, yet you can go get on food stamps very heavy yet."
724.0,Provider,So.
2692.0,Patient,"he's not at all, helping."
724.0,Provider,Okay How long have you been there for.
2692.0,Patient,Right after that happened so couple weeks I guess.
724.0,Provider,"All right, maybe, maybe have to have a conversation with him at some point about the expectations of staying there you know what I mean like if you're going to stay. That you at least need to do X, Y and Z makes my efforts know at venable try to be quiet, while you're trying to sleep at night. For you. Because you're already getting disrupted sleep, as it is so sorry I was really um. So you get to establish like a regular nighttime routine know what I mean like I know it's tough to say, and it seems counterproductive, but you do have to. Try to be consistent with your sleep patterns right as much as you can so going to bed, the same time, every night is one way to start try to de escalate some of the stress before you've laid down."
2692.0,Patient,"me like when I get on my soapbox and it should be a lot easier, I also take sleep. every night so."
724.0,Provider,What do you take it for sleep AIDS.
2692.0,Patient,tylenol pm.
724.0,Provider,About a pharmacologist I don't like.
2692.0,Patient,I know.
724.0,Provider,I don't like sleep aids when you're on you know CNS is already so people are feeling psychically a CNS central nervous system suppressing I don't like. When you and I could be completely wrong they could be no adverse side effects to it but. Even if there was by universal precaution kicks in and I don't have like the space to keep track of all the pharmacology combinations of stuff so universally I just tell people it's not a good thing that's probably not safe melatonin Ek.
2692.0,Patient,"I have used the melatonin but they just kind of stopped working and. Maybe me on track sedona and that's lot more stronger than you know town again, so I really. Am Sir okay."
724.0,Provider,yeah I don't know like I just I don't like them. I get a little nervous with them not not personally it's just like.
2692.0,Patient,"you're not the only one, I couldn't even get a pharmacy has prescribed this medication for over a year. Here in town are comfortable with it."
724.0,Provider,"yeah, so it is. I do some other holistic stuff you know, maybe try getting back on the melatonin are you taking transit on still or."
2692.0,Patient,No i'm just taking a ton of games now.
724.0,Provider,Will you prescribe tries it out through us. And that stopped.
2692.0,Patient,"yeah because of that, because of that. You know me starting over and groups, the first time that's when I happened so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean I have it in here that it's prescribed to you so yeah I mean maybe there's not a side effect with it, I just. Get nervous."
2692.0,Patient,don't think that we were really. Had a hard time with the almost didn't even do it was exciting it makes vacation.
724.0,Provider,But a lot of.
2692.0,Patient,boxing hot.
724.0,Provider,commodity and or like a like a benzo.
2692.0,Patient,know it has been so.
724.0,Provider,yeah again another CNS will they don't want to do is prescribed so many central nervous system suppressants that the combination just whereas know dod like your automatic functioning and puts you in a potential state for.
2692.0,Patient,You know yeah.
724.0,Provider,"They say overdose but it like trying to show you what happens is like here so. Everything just slows down to the point to where it starts to interfere with its natural like a functioning and that's where you actually develop some medical problems. not have the good kinds. So yeah a lot, a lot of prescribers rural think they tend to stay away from that stuff. And for the right reasons uh. Well i'm hoping that you get the medication thing kind of squared away, or at least getting to it, so you can get back on track. As far as the. As far as the nighttime routine you got to make like a conscious effort to do some stuff that you can't manage not everything is within your control currently but the thing is that you can again making sure that. you're. decompressing. While you're awake you're stressed stress versus just being like i'm just gonna go to bed and try to sleep it off because your brain is going to deep decompress that bad it's."
2692.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's not benefiting you so this little things that you could use a little bit of like breathing exercises before bed, you know, like the. Deep breaths in through your nose and really slowly your bile yesterday sitting up straight when you do it can get your heart rate settled, you know kind of free your mind a little bit. Listen to some some guided meditations allow that to kind of like work you to sleep, potentially, let me. Make sure all your doors are locked on your windows lot to do a safety check that will help put your mind at ease a little bit."
2692.0,Patient,So anyways.
724.0,Provider,"Right so stuff like that. yeah and then you're just gonna have to. just allow your brain that processes and have conversations when you're ready, you know don't feel like you're forced to talk about it all, at one time, like. You know your brain has a process and it could take a long time. But it's it's your time to determine when you're when you're ready to do it so don't feel pressured i'll never i'll never force you to disclose stuff that you're not comfortable talking about if you don't want to talk about it it's fine."
2692.0,Patient,A lot of stuff I haven't even talked about they just want to forget about.
724.0,Provider,him or pandora's box.
2692.0,Patient,"The isley just makes me want to use when it's talk about it, so I just avoid it right."
724.0,Provider,"But you're using is a is a default mechanism. it's still avoiding you know. You have some sense it gives us a pass you know to. To mass the hurt a little bit so we get a little bit of reward I got a bit, but it's not healthy. When you're not if you can't talk about it. You know, to look another person or a family member or anybody, sometimes it helps to write how you're feeling, you know if you are getting emotions about a certain thing, and you are triggered that you don't have a way of getting it out of out of your head writing it down. And then burning it. it's very cathartic right, so you get like a trash can you know you could write all this stuff down and when you're done light a match that burn it and be like, but at least you got it out, you got to into the real world in order to be."
2692.0,Patient,"A good idea, no, no."
724.0,Provider,"It helps with with some forms of closure and you may never man ever get to a point in life to where you you're 100% honest with anybody about these things about our feelings or experiences, but. it's cloudy when it's in here. That makes sense it's really one side so putting on paper, makes it real you know you could go to go to the beach and scream you shift into crashing waves makes it real. So it leaves the body of like a lot of pressure, but if it doesn't have it out manages that just builds over time that's like cancer that hurts so. I always encourage people to write because it's very personable. You know, and if you want people to read cool if you don't you can burn it, you can do all kinds of stuff you know all kinds of you know hanging up on the wall punch the shit out of it, whatever it is that makes you feel. Like you've got your justice out of it burning It is like super cathartic that I find it one of the best models they dig a hole thrown into the whole burn it whatever you want throw gasoline on it, I get huge fire, but whatever you want. people get like that reward out of it so. Think about. what's that."
2692.0,Patient,"So I guess that's why I like fighting in school, and I really thought about school lot."
724.0,Provider,And a lot of times when we fight with people it's really not about that person it's just about what we're going through and we needed an outlet so. Controlled aggression. So. that's what I would encourage you to start thinking about a little bit down the road carly let like the main focus would be. trying to get trying to get your sleep on track with as much stuff that you can do on your own. it's the medication. This guy that you will live with he doesn't have an ID does he have a picture.
2692.0,Patient,"i've been asking them all day to go get a medicine, and I think he did he text me and I was going to check it out after my group, I don't think he did."
724.0,Provider,"i'd be like you and I are gonna walk down to this pharmacy and you're going to walk in and get my it's like like I would make him do it. What do you do, what does he do during the day. Nothing nothing i'd be like I couchsurfing we go for a walk."
2692.0,Patient,"Well, his sister kicked him out for a reason so i'm certain kind of understand why."
724.0,Provider,What is the reason just lack of mine.
2692.0,Patient,He said it was because he wasn't get along with the sister's boyfriend. He said no.
724.0,Provider,don't don't allow it to get to the point to where you can't kick about.
2692.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"So establish those expectations kind of early, I know that I know that it's nice having somebody else in the House for sure. But he's got to contribute in some kind of way. Alright um. What about a cell far any thoughts, so far, no, no, I know, in the text, you said you had some stupid thoughts, you want to elaborate."
2692.0,Patient,"Yes, then. I mean it crossed my mind, I thought about it that's the first time I thought about it in years. um, but they were more of just thoughts they weren't sears you know. Like a i'm only succeeded a couple times, so I mean I know what i'm at that point."
724.0,Provider,"Obviously, if you ever feel like you get to that point call us first before you do anything. You know reckless or something you might regret later. um. Is there anything that I can help you with currently I feel like there's not a whole lot that i'm doing for you right now."
2692.0,Patient,not really.
724.0,Provider,"um. Is there anybody that you could talk to. text or. You know chat or anything like that you have anybody that you could talk to you like, when you feel down or."
2692.0,Patient,"not really I like. My mom doesn't even know what happened, I didn't talk to her about it, I don't want to talk to her about it."
724.0,Provider,yeah. Do you want to meet weekly for a little bit.
2692.0,Patient,They want you.
724.0,Provider,"Know basket, what do you want to do."
2692.0,Patient,"um how you know, honestly, I just want to get through this. I just want to get back on track with my paperwork and my my you know bills and stuff and just move on be honest."
724.0,Provider,"uh well what i'd like to do is check in on you, you know, once a week for the next couple of weeks if that would be cool with you. So. what's a good time for you."
2692.0,Patient,don't know anytime after one I guess.
724.0,Provider,anytime after. I can do. I could do. I could do 1pm on next Thursday.
2692.0,Patient,what's a date. breath week. my birthday or my son's birthday is coming up.
724.0,Provider,know what there's a. So Saturday. It was what's rough about the.
2692.0,Patient,New stillborn.
724.0,Provider,"How long, it was a."
2692.0,Patient,pb.
724.0,Provider,To do anything.
2692.0,Patient,"I used to make it. Because he sent on on top of his grandfather and. My expert has you know money for a plaque nobody even knows he's there twice and make up a plaque every year. Good let's go, you know from the weather beat up every year, so I can make a new new whenever you're. going to stop dealing with that. Because everything else was just too rough."
724.0,Provider,Trying to do something this year.
2692.0,Patient,"i'd like to but. everything's going on at. least not right now. I even have a picture of him, because my ex took it all."
724.0,Provider,I think you should do if it's still do something.
2692.0,Patient,go down there.
724.0,Provider,"Now again i'm a huge proponent for writing. Because I find that to be one of the most cathartic things that we could do. And I would write whatever's in your heart. And for yourself from some of that hurt. That would be. My encouragement for you. Alright, so will she will follow up on Thursday, if you don't hear anything before then, as far as like medication for sure, let them know here and see if we could get something going for you. Can yeah, then let me know all right. All right, we'll try get some rest try doing some of that of that guided meditation before bed tonight. All right. alright."
2692.0,Patient,Next week.
724.0,Provider,"For transcription That was a session for Belinda do she reported that she was a assaulted or the years Eve weekend by a gentleman who was taken into custody sometime later. She didn't relapse as a result. she's got a significant trauma history and. Her coping skills are not developed and this recent event is not. it's not helping her at this point so we're gonna. we're going to go over as much of this trauma that she's willing to divulge without pressing too much, I want to give her her space and some clear boundaries. But I would like to work on some of these things with her in the future when she felt comfortable current her current barrier is she doesn't have an ID so picking up a prescription has been problematic she does have a roommate. Who is currently couchsurfing who she's looking to see if he can go down there pick up the meds for her. So there's a little bit of logistics barrier there she doesn't have the financial funds to go and get the new ID. she's this. she's got a lot of barriers to to. To treatment currently so I did go over her pH Q dot I think over get seven or. are delayed talk screen today because I wanted to get her story from the incident i'll address that stuff next week with her, I have a follow up appointment on the 20th. At 1pm. Hopefully, by that she's got the medication component. taken care of. Discussing treatment intervention as far as. Progressive muscle relaxation. Some stress management. Some decompression techniques three four bed to help with the night terrors. Other than that i'm going to follow up with her next week i'm going to talk to you chantelle tomorrow as well, I believe that's her provider. That nothing else for transcription."
