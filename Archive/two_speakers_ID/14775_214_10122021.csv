14775.0,Patient,"i'm kind of crappy I I. Had niece's wedding that we went to Sunday, and it was just pouring down rain and I was. Pretty, no, no, no. Anxious and. kind of bitchy for lack of a better word with people just kidding. No, no, no. idea in my head that things she goes, certainly when they don't when I get irritated and frustrated none I just kind of want to isolate."
214.0,Provider,But when i'm in a crowd of.
14775.0,Patient,"People I can't really do that and. People want to talk to me and stuff and I felt like I was short and then I have to apologize a lot then it's like I get really tired and I just want to go home, but then I can you know, so my normal. Isolating coping skills don't play into when i'm in a big crowded room with family and friends so."
214.0,Provider,"Sure, and do you feel so i'm going to use a different word, but you feel bigger expert me some what is going on with your expectation of others or events or situations."
14775.0,Patient,"Well, I feel like i'm I was trying to help my my niece out with. I used to you know I used to be a high functioning person and done a lot of weddings and stuff and I tried to you know, make a lot of recommendations to her not have her wedding in Seattle outdoors and to have backup plans and. I felt like there was a lot of expectations put on me to be the person that I used to be and. I don't move around and i'm not as physically able, as I used to be so. She was kind of demanding and shatter wedding outdoors and I told them because I was under the tent waiting for the wedding to start and. I said Can someone please call me when the wedding starts, so I can make sure i'm in my place that i'm supposed to be there Irina when they're getting ready. And then I was in the tent and I heard noise and I turned around and they were already like already down the aisle and everything and no one that told me, so I kind of had to hustle to get down there and then it was just pouring down rain and I just I was just really. miserable and frustrated missed, you know kind of we'd all been really looking forward to this and I missed it nobody told me, and then I get down there. And then I was videotaping a little bit that I could, and you know the pouring down rain was coming in and then she wanted me to help with the Buffet line and. You know, and then I was trying to do that, but I just really tired and I just I just you know it's just that's what gets me in trouble, when I have expectations of others that. Exact no. I don't know I I had a friend is always saying Carol you're in your own way and for the longest time I didn't know what that means, but it's my picture in my head of how things. In my perfect world, should be when they're built when things don't happen according the way I think they should be, I just kind of have little you know, like meltdowns like oh my God I missed the whole wedding and. yeah you know I just kind of panic and then I just want to cry or get angry."
214.0,Provider,"But, are you are, you are you. mean is there is there a part that I mean I get that you're tired and there's things going on, but are we making any adjustments to that, to see if we can. Get back into some type of engagement, some type of activity, some type of maybe not so much expectation, but understanding, you know from rains we're going to get worse, like where do you think you are with that."
14775.0,Patient,"Well, I feel like I tried to prepare myself mentally and like i'll get worked up about stuff and then I have to remind myself to calm down and kind of do some. Like meditation like just breathe, let it go, you know, and I think it really all stems from an internal frustration that. What I want to do what I wish my life was and what I would, is what I can actually do like when when I want to be able to participate and I get so tired and I just want to fall asleep worry. or I used to be really physically capable and I get people like my kids are like you need to just eat better and exercise but i'm like you know, sometimes it's, all I can do to just get out of bed get a shower. And then. And then I just i'm embarrassed dilemma. You know."
214.0,Provider,I don't want you to feel embarrassed.
14775.0,Patient,"And I used to be i'm sorry but. These to be like this, you know just kind of the shining star or family and be able to host. barge in and just make things happen for people and be the go to person strong person, and you know I feel like i'm the weakest person."
214.0,Provider,moment it's okay.
14775.0,Patient,"And then right before the wedding. I got a letter from social security that they just denied my disability claim that I. i've been pretty much disabled kind of like this, since 2012 but if tried to work they've tried to do everything to. be the perfect vegetarian I have good health and forced myself to have some structured sleep I J.

And so they wanted to take me down. or change it, because of the liver and so she had to talk to her boss to figure out what we can do. But because I had experienced my my emotional support dog died. About eight weeks ago. They wanted me to help like a little more calmer, and you know get past this wedding and then try to come down safely off switch. So my next meeting with her on Friday were to talk about switching to a different medication, but I haven't always got to get the healthcare, I need because I had good jobs and good insurance and the now i'm on like welfare medicaid.
