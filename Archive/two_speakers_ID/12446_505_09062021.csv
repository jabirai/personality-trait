12446.0,Patient,"Okay, so he. started back on pills on percocet yeah few months back I say about April and I didn't agree with the you know we are here, and since then we haven't really talked like. I guess he goes to work he comes home he goes in his room he you know he just he's been pushing us away because of it, and once he broke his hand a prescribed on Simon at the hospital and I was talking about it because of everything going on at home, you know. sure this made him feel the heat because he had a prescription and then. I went to well his friend went to his mom, and so this man that he was back on posts and his mom texted me the day of my uncle's funeral and asked me about it said that she was worried about him, so I went over to her house a couple days later. and talk to her about it and told her. what's been going on, he wanted me to lie to her, and you know that he didn't have a problem and. Sure, the assignment because of the script and I didn't do. got mad at me about it for a couple days but mine isn't going to help them, you know, so I tried to get them in clinics, I tried everything to get him to quit again because he was on pills for a few years back to me. But we almost got clean and we stayed I stayed clean and he stay present and April this year. And I told his mom everything that was going on. Okay well his brother, which is only sibling. thought that I was the one back on those and that I was or Dave was covering for me and saying it was him back i'm supposed to make. me look good like he just thought it was me going back down hill so he or his mom somebody on that side of family across espn. csv came out they drug tested Dave at the time Dave did not have known our products in a system, because after he got prescribe the script we gotten a big argument about it and I sold them either after the script is gone you either gates mean or i'm gone. I can do this. And he did. He got in he was tall days clean the day CSP showed up so he I was there were he took his drug test me let the csv file to the kids. And then they came back a couple of days later and drug tested me. I had my success in my system, and then I had arrow and my system, so I told them, I was working on either. I was trying to get off that are off for a couple weeks, and then I started working and I just I couldn't do it like I just. don't have the motivation to go work and do everything and concentrate like when I go to work if I don't have that or I don't stand test and I like start five different things and don't finish none of them, and it takes me forever it's just our. And I explained that the csv and everything so they're. Having pet they haven't, let us know where they're going from here because we did have a case, right after freedom was born. And it got opened and closed pretty quick. I was on it, I told him everything the whole time and I. didn't they wanted me to. Do and so she closes out pretty quick well it's the same CSP lady again so you know she knows I family she knows our history she's worked with her before. not sure where it's going to go from here. they're supposed to be coming back sometime this week after they got my drug test back and to talk more."

You know, again, I suppose we never that or should see it, we didn't take our kids with us to go for goodness we you know we shelter them from it as much as we could and I don't like them going around that because I grew up in it and I don't want them growing up. yeah my biggest thing in life is. I do, I want to go through it. No Okay, no I didn't get a child. I want to make sure that they do. So we got an argument over this past weekend over his family farms dsp and all the stress and me, trying to work in him, trying to go back to work, early just because our bills are piling up. yeah so we got an. argument, it was Thursday I left. And I went and stayed at my mother's House for a couple nights but you know by the third night being there as. Much for my life. My other two boys went to the grandpas their dad. father's house, while we were in our Community, you know they didn't go. With timestamp my moms and he kept Braden when I left on because breathing and can't go in a house where people smoke cigarettes or you know any type of smoker. it's hard to take him around people definitely the coven because of this disease, so he stayed home with me because, regardless of anything that Dave and I are going through these wonderful dad never let nothing.

But when he gets the craving to do perfect he was just go do like eight or nine capsules of his carried on but then he talks about the next day how he feels like dog shit. They can feel like the day before, and he sees. is to create i'm doing it too because. It is he's not going to create them every day so he's actually seeing the side effect of what it's doing to him because I tried to do create them when I first got off to a long time ago and I felt like that stuff made me sicker and. i'm going to do it without puking it up, so he sees that it's not working for him, but she's been three weeks clean and he does he does meeting um he isn't any suggestions or anything but he does go to a meeting afterwards and. cool ill. He has a therapist that he talks to."
