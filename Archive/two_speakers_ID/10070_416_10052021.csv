10070.0,Patient,only do I was just sitting here at my m&ms.
416.0,Provider,whoa delicious.
10070.0,Patient,Sometimes you just eat a couple of m&ms it is what it is.
416.0,Provider,"it's a perfectly fine yeah. How are you i'm so sorry for all the confusion around scheduling it's been a little bit of a mess, but thank you for being flexible."
10070.0,Patient,I know what we do is very difficult and. that's something that's so easy to give.
416.0,Provider,"So. what's the news, how are you."
10070.0,Patient,"i'm fine i'm nothing, nothing new nothing super crazy going on my mom's coming to visit this weekend. She has."
416.0,Provider,"been out there, how she."
10070.0,Patient,"She came once before, like maybe last spring or last early this year, I think. Just for the weekend and she was like asked if she could come she was like I really want to see you before being becomes and like we can spend some one on one time together. And I don't know that's super exciting to me so. But Dan is going back home, the same weekend to celebrate his brother's graduation and I decided not to go, because I just. don't think it's going to be very comfortable flying home seven months pregnant, so I took a hard pass on that one and it worked out fine their mom's coming so i'm excited."
416.0,Provider,wow. So how are you feeling about being seven months pregnant where's your head of these days.
10070.0,Patient,"I feel like I am adjusting well, I think. And I kind of bothers me on a daily basis when I it's like people immediately comment on their bodies, as I walk in a room and I. Just one of those like. It just is what it is and like. it's always positive or something negative anybody saying, other than like all men they're like ooh ooh. Thanks Bob but that part it's kind of like still weird it's like no other time of my life has anyone, just like. commented on my appearance so freely. So that's strange, but I feel like i've adjusted well like I just almost expected and when people don't i'm like. elephant in the room, like oh man look you. Look amazing today, thank you Okay, now we can move on with our regular conversation."
416.0,Provider,Get the necessary comments out of the way.
10070.0,Patient,"I think i'm not ready for the new look so big comments I think that's like hit me a little bit harder when people started saying that I think my my like boss's boss came into work today and she's like oh my gosh and growing so much, I was like."
416.0,Provider,watch it lady.
10070.0,Patient,"Your let your like dance with words, and I appreciate not saying look big. Thank you. it's strange, but I feel okay about baby and. I took a few days off last week, because the student that I was working with called out sick with a sore throat fever congestion and I was like no now i'm not doing this today i'm going on, like I don't want to be around all the stickies I don't want it. Like everyone super understand, so I put together this dresser and the glider yeah."
416.0,Provider,I was gonna say something about that I was like I see some differences in your banker.
10070.0,Patient,"You know, Dan shoe is just on it."
416.0,Provider,he's got added don't touch it.
10070.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's everywhere, but I feel a little better like just getting the ball rolling getting some things in motion."
416.0,Provider,starts to get pretty real.
10070.0,Patient,"I feel like the length of all of this is starting to help and not hurt anymore, where it's like the preparation period. yeah feels so good, I have plenty of time. To get all my things together, I feel, like everything like falling into place where it should be."
416.0,Provider,fed.
10070.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know there's still that like General. What goes on."
416.0,Provider,"How have you been doing with some of the things that we talked about last time around. Being able to ask for help a little bit more, and you know kind of giving yourself a break, of not. Not having to be superwoman all the time."
10070.0,Patient,"it's going Okay, I feel like once I enter the threshold of physical pain, then i'm like Okay, I need to take a step back, I need to do this. And it definitely helps that everyone is very accommodating and like it's like oh my gosh, of course, like absolutely. which reinforces me asking for a break or asking you to sit down or just sitting down in general, like they're like yeah thing furniture sitting down, so I don't know it's going fine. But. I like had a long conversation with my boss who's also my neighbor who's also like one of my close friends so it's an. Interesting relationship and one of our co workers is like really floundering right now and, like her, and I. are speaking about it in a way, where like. I work really hard at my job. and part of the incentive I love my job, so it, it makes it easy to work hard at my job, but like one of the incentives, why I. want to excel is because I don't want to detriment, the relationship that I have with my co workers and my supervisors, because I love them so much. That it's like not like the need to please but it's like the I want you to respect me in all aspects of my life and, if I can not even professionally excel just like be responsible like take care of the things that I didn't take care of and communicate well, then it. feels like it strengthens the relationship between them, or if I were to you know, like do things that would be out of my character to do at work that show up later leave earlier, you know, like not. work at the ethic that i'm used to I feel like it would detriment our relationship and her and I had like a good conversation about that, and like. She like pointed that out in me and she's like I know that's what you're doing and I know why you do it, and she was like I just want you to know that, like. We all like love you so much, and like know that you have to take some like rest too, so it was like nice to point that out to like a lot of our team. talks about like mental health stuff and like take a day, we need a day and like it's we're all like super understanding, so I think it's been like a good."
416.0,Provider,culmination pretty healthy work environment.
10070.0,Patient,"Right, I know who would have thought that it's possible. i'm impressed."
416.0,Provider,Any great.
10070.0,Patient,"yeah so it's super nice honestly like knowing that everyone's supportive and cares, but I also think i've worked hard to get to the point where I am in like earning everyone's like trust in your spec and."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean this is it you sound really different than you did last time, because your last time it was very much like I can't let them down I can't let them down I need to take it on because what if. What if they are going to have to cover for me and I need to just get it all in now, you know and. And you don't sound like that now. So clearly that conversation with your boss was a game changer for you."
10070.0,Patient,"yeah and I think like I have a lot of like overall and security and the relationships that I have. But when I received the affirmation it tones down the insecurity it's like Oh, they hate me they don't want to work with me I bother them when I reach out for help it's annoying like those are sometimes the thoughts. But then receive the affirmation of like oh no like. We love to help you or like you're such a hard worker, as anyone, you know, like receive that affirmation it can calm down the. relational insecurity."
416.0,Provider,The brain weasels. degree yeah definitely some some. Some relational brain weasels I hear in your talk.
10070.0,Patient,"Difficult it's like. there's a balance between being self aware and like I know plenty of people that. Like kind of put other people inconvenience and like they'll speak to me about them they're like. So, and so like needed so much help today and so much feedback and like I just don't have the time and it's not that they're employing them but they're like. I just can't give you all that you need I need you to be a little bit more independent and go to your thing so it's the balance of. I don't want to think disordered about it and have the. sauce like the hating."
416.0,Provider,they're annoyed by me and.
10070.0,Patient,"do this on my own, but then know that they're supportive of me I don't want to take up too much of the time when I need them, you know I need some guidance so it's just."
416.0,Provider,"Finding that balance. yep student can be tricky. I think you're you're it seems like you've come closer to it, though, but you you kind of on the way to this you've kind of put yourself through a little bit of extra stress. You know, with that, like."
10070.0,Patient,yeah. The extra stress that gets me. yeah but it almost feels like the process that my brain goes through. It like ads on all the extra stress and then just works itself out and I usually end up in the right place. mm hmm have to be in a heightened state for a little. And then can get to where I need to go.
416.0,Provider,"Is there a part of you that worries that if you don't worry enough about it, you won't get there."
10070.0,Patient,Absolutely uh. huh it looks it's like telling myself that I don't care. don't stress about it than I don't. Care enough about it.
416.0,Provider,"So the like the underlying belief is really like if i'm too laid back and go with the flow then good things won't happen, I have to stress about them and having anxiety about them in order to make things manifest though I want."
10070.0,Patient,or it's yes or it's. People will have the the thought about me that I don't care about things. yeah it's like a perception to.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so okay. So when you hear that out loud does anything come up for you."
10070.0,Patient,"No, no, I think a lot of. My like background like story is that, like i'm a very hard worker i'm very passionate about certain things and I feel like if I. If I feel like I not fitting into the narrative that i've created for myself it's a crisis."
416.0,Provider,uh huh.
10070.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So I mean that makes sense because it's not just the narrative it's your values like you value that right that's a big deal for you it's part of what you like about yourself, so you don't want to let that go. And it's also like this thing that you put yourself through. That causes a lot of anxiety. And stress. Usually unnecessarily, but not always."
10070.0,Patient,I will say that I have noticed myself having a lot less anxiety in the past few weeks with letting smaller things go that I normally would have a lot of things.
416.0,Provider,What I love it how what's allowed you to do that.
10070.0,Patient,"I don't know, I think the thought of. Not the thought of having a baby, but the whole idea around it has like shifted my perspective, a little bit and that like. I just can't give energy to certain things like I just I just don't have it anymore, and maybe i'm a little bit more tired than usual and it's like I don't have the energy to devote to this right now, so I can't stress about it and. Like smaller things that I would have a lot of anxiety for no reason, like. When I get dressed in the morning, I have anxiety about the temperature or how people perceive me or like this is so tmi but, like my nipples are like bigger than they were before before like but I don't want to like. stress my children out with my nipples so like things like that would give me anxiety when now I just looked at myself Well, this is what we're in today. And i'm comfortable and i'm not going to be too hot, it is what it is, or like my feet have been bothering me so i'm like well read speakers today and this one, it is. And like it's all these little quirks that I know that I have where I just kind of have to let go and like prior to that I would be like continuously anxious about it throughout the day. or now it's just. This number at. monetizing for it okay. So it's an interesting place to be in or I think it's honestly like a mental priority shift."
416.0,Provider,Of sounds like it.
10070.0,Patient,"Yes, can't devote the energy to the anxiety we'll all did."
416.0,Provider,"it's a really, really smart way, to put it, because it takes a lot of energy right. And you've got other things that you want to direct your energy to so you just don't have to give."
10070.0,Patient,"yeah it's like I mean basic functioning today. I can't give the anxiety all their energy today. And like I don't know really how easy, that is, if you know we're. I don't know."
416.0,Provider,If it's actually think it's pretty healthy.
10070.0,Patient,Okay that's good.
416.0,Provider,"here's why because I don't actually care how we accomplished this I care that it. is accomplished and having sort of a taste of have the ability to say i'm going to i'm going to focus my energy on this and not this. In a way, that is healthy for you, having I don't care how you get that I want you to get that and you're getting it right. Because it puts you instead of being controlled by your anxiety, it does give you that sense and the understanding. That there is some level of control that you do have right where you can direct your energy to certain things and let other things go. it's hard, but this is sort of just forcing you to do it, whereas it. might have taken years of therapy otherwise, and here you are so i'm thrilled to hear it. and babies have a way of doing that right babies and tragedies big life events. yeah tend to put things in perspective, like that right."
10070.0,Patient,And I feel like this is kind of how I address a lot of things is like I put myself in a situation where i'm forced to address it and forced to do some face to face of it.
416.0,Provider,So I love that. I love that you're able to to to direct that attention and and it sounds like it's kind of happening naturally so maybe see if you can do it a little more like increase it even a little more. yeah lean into it as a perfect way of saying it.
10070.0,Patient,I think. it's like my analytical brain wants to like create a chart of like what's important and what's not important like create a list of like. My brush your hair brush your teeth you. Know to do this do that.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
10070.0,Patient,Just because when I let myself Captain the ship not my anxiety it's like I almost don't trust myself with. The executive decision making.
416.0,Provider,"Oh wow that's so interesting especially coming from you, because your your Executive functioning is actually very high yeah. Right you pay the price for it sometimes you struggle, because you stress over those decisions so much you agonize over them, but your Executive executive functioning is the last thing i'd be worried about with you."
10070.0,Patient,I feel like my anxiety is just done it for me for so long it's like.
416.0,Provider,"that's why you're hesitant to let go of it it's like if I don't have anxiety, then that i'm not going to have high executive functioning."
10070.0,Patient,yeah totally.
416.0,Provider,Interesting Have you ever actually thought about it that way before.
10070.0,Patient,"No, not at all. It serves a purpose, you know."
416.0,Provider,It does.
10070.0,Patient,"It makes sense, why I feel that way."
416.0,Provider,"Yes, it does, and I think that if you. I think that in your wise, mind you probably know that actually it's doing the opposite. Right, the the person in charge of the executive functioning is you write your anxieties not driving that. A little bit of anxiety ISM is important in some situations right because it, it is an indication of how important something is to us right like oh that it's important that I pass this class I need a little anxiety because that's what's going to push me to study. yeah i'm on the edge of the cliff my life is important to me i'm going to get back right, those are so. In evolutionary sense that anxiety is important, but when it starts to shut when you have so much of it and you rely on it so heavily for that executive functioning that it like starts to shut you down and cause you grief and pain. And then it obviously it's a flip yeah so. But it was never the anxiety. That was that was the functioning part of you know right the anxiety, it can be a lesson or an indicator of how important something is to you. But it's not what's driving you."
10070.0,Patient,"Because it's so before to where it's like. Certain things aren't important to me, but I get so much anxiety doing them. mm hmm and it's like things that I don't. it's like just like a plethora of different things that I get anxiety from so it's like hard to read sometimes why i'm getting all this anxiety for this random scenario that i'm in, so I think like trying to root it and then decide if it's important or why I feel this way or. try and find where it's coming from is helpful. Yes, but it's just difficult. In the moment like when addressing I get anxiety because certain things are important to me where that's not always the case."
416.0,Provider,"Right, but those are the ones that you are wanting to not let go of right the ones that you're where you're getting anxiety because the test or the baby or the job or whatever is important to you. So you don't want to let go of that, but you don't want to let it paralyze you so it's about kind of right sizing it for that one. But then getting anxiety for things like being anxious about something that's not actually dangerous or that important is definitely disordered and so then looking at where did this pattern under those circumstances come from. Because that's when it's particularly unhelpful right that's when it can shut you down it feels like for no reason. What can you think of an example for that one right now."
10070.0,Patient,"I like when I go to New places together very uncomfortable. When I go on my always remember to do it for work and I just talked to be like you're fine you're okay. A lot of like when I go to a new middle school or high school so uncomfortable because you're like I hate being around teenagers and they get back into the life of high school, I always felt this way and then. Like trying to find different buildings and like navigate all of that gives me a decent bit of anxiety, but also like. Today we have like a bigger work meeting and I had to give her presentation and I felt perfectly fine until it started, and I was like got like flush and like a little bit more anxious and I was Okay, but I definitely feel like I didn't. I wasn't myself."
416.0,Provider,was a little bit about like some kind of outward facing social stuff.
10070.0,Patient,"yeah well. yeah yeah and I know it's like very common I know it's. it's understandable it's like the social aspect of the anxiety, but it's like with each of the people that I presented to I can speak to any of them and, if anything, was the combination of everyone sitting together, it was like whoa I can't do this. So. The. paralyzing feeling. Is conflicting with the level of importance it's like arriving to a new school is it is anxiety, but it does it's not particularly important for me to be there."
416.0,Provider,"What are the messages in your hat, what are your thoughts, when you start to get that anxiety."
10070.0,Patient,"kind of different, but today it was like. How can I stop this like stop like you're being absurd. And then, like in new social settings it's like. People looking at you were thinking about you, people were like what is she doing she looks loss that kind of thing."
416.0,Provider,Okay yeah. that's sort of self conscious social i'm good i'm going to be judged. I am being judge yeah yeah.
10070.0,Patient,"Okay, but it's also gets easier, with time, so the desensitization of it goes well, but at first it's really difficult and if I choose not to run, I know that it will get better but it's like in the moment i'm just like go like that's not do this today. So I know that it's it gets better but it's still initially."
416.0,Provider,Okay. yeah. And you do it pretty often right.
10070.0,Patient,"yeah so it's not. Like it's like the first time that I go to a new school. Like I every single time it's like this. But it's also Nice because all the people that I work with hated to know like oh yeah he high school it's so uncomfortable and like I hate being there, and all the kids are on the quarter note. So it's a nice the shared experience, and I was like yeah he did sorry I hate that you have to go."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. um. yeah I mean like you said that that one is pretty common and, of course, like the more you do it like you said, the, the easier it will get and it's also you know. I think that offering those yourself, like the breathing and the counter statements in the beginning and but maybe like some maybe slightly gentler counter statements, because you're telling yourself like stop this is ridiculous, or something along those lines, but maybe, just like. People are not liking it me there justice self consciousness, I am. yeah or you know you know something else everybody else is just as nervous, as I am right now."
10070.0,Patient,I like. The grace that I give to people that do the same thing I am like you're doing so amazing like I give people so much grace. or when I see someone like having a hard time doing things that I have a hard time doing or anything that we're having a hard time I like want to swoop in and be like okay it's okay you got this don't don't stress so it's like. Do that oh.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay well. i'm glad to hear that you are having an easier time sort of prioritizing that your. or letting go of the things that aren't priority priorities that's What I mean to say. I think that's a really healthy and i'm glad to hear that I guess, I think that my only like feedback around this would be to just try to. yeah try to give yourself some more of that grace the kinder messages right like everybody's in this together i'm going to approach this like the hour and just because I love those counter statements, but those can be really. We have to be careful with them that we're not being hard on ourselves. yeah. So um. How are things with you and Dan."
10070.0,Patient,"Good we are on to like. Little tip. yesterday. yeah it's. So frustrating sometimes but. Our dog. His nails were getting too long, he hates getting them cut and we took them to a groomer. few months ago, and he bit the groomer and the blood and I was so mortified i'm so sorry and you think it's okay like. I didn't know or I wasn't reading him well like I didn't see that he was getting really frustrated and I was like no don't take it on do you have and so sorry if there's anything I can do, let me know. So it's just a bottle and then our vet wants to like put him under anesthesia to put his meals, which is just like."
416.0,Provider,Put a muzzle on him.
10070.0,Patient,"So I asked him to help me with it yesterday, and he was like no I don't want to was like I understand that, but the dog is like walking like this, like his feet don't look good and like we need to do something about it. And I was like can you just take the dog and like distract him, so I can at least do our dogs nails music asher so he brought him into the our spare bedroom and like. sat on the computer and watch videos while the dog has peanut butter and it's like underneath the dresser stuck and he's like screaming and here's being like getting upset and living room, so I got frustrated and I gave up I like to nails and gave up. i'm not sure what the plan of attack is for now, but."
416.0,Provider,kind of my fault.
10070.0,Patient,"I know I know, but then it's like he squirms like away from you, too, and like will do this like like his arms in so."
416.0,Provider,I think about some CBD oil and a muzzle.
10070.0,Patient,"or twin is as of now, I flew him across the country and we gave him like a mess, and that makes them like relax and calm down so we're going to try that and see how that goes with in combination with a muzzle. I just feel bathroom because it's like behaviorally we're putting him through these difficult experiences. And therefore, he has like a even works mindset about it and we don't get anything accomplished so like at first, I was like giving him a treat every few seconds for sitting there nicely and like. Flooding them put his nose in the peanut butter jar and like, but then, at a certain point. It becomes like a little bit irrational i'm like i'm not going to hurt you this is not hurting like john let me cut it i'm helping you, and then I get frustrated and then I feel like dance not helping me either. What are we make it's a frustrating experience in total, but I like give up and like told them like just go play we'll try again later. I came in the room, was like damn like you couldn't even handle Franklin and who's a consumer horror be sitting here. laughing I was like okay great and he was like well i've been trying little little bit and I just at that point, like, I felt like I wasn't going to say anything very kind. So I just like walked away and cleaned up all this stuff and then he, like when the living room and tried to cut the dogs nails and obviously didn't work out and I just got in the shower and like. shut the door and just took some time to myself, but we. didn't speak all afternoon, and then I ordered dinner, and I got him dinner to and he was, I think he for dinner and went back and he's also has a ton of school work to do so, he was actually busy doing it, and it was like. Not that we would have like chatted a ton anyways but. I feel like. it's difficult. And I know that it's better to say nothing and say something that, like, I will look back on and be like embarrassed about or will regret saying. So it like feels beneficial to me because my like for rational thoughts calm down, where I like At first I like when the shower i'm like almost cried and which is like what the Fuck is wrong with you like, why are you so annoying that just crushes with so much like. Like our dog you don't care about what kind of feeding you like what if I would have let all those things out into the air, it will be productive for anybody so it's like. calming down, and I know like it's not super healthy to just not speak to each other, either, but I think. The time that I have taken to not me it's like given me the clarity to speak on what I want to speak about."
416.0,Provider,yep.
10070.0,Patient,"So it's difficult but and then so we we like I went to bed last night and we haven't spoken about it, but then, in the middle of the night, Dan like elbows me in the back and I like. And like like hill elbow me on accident and he sleeping and I just like tap on his own home move it would you like tapped on me back, and I was like. Yes, like are you okay he's like you're in the middle of the bed, and I was like not not totally probably was I was like, why not and he's like yeah. But it's like do not elbow me in the back, if you want to tell me scoot over you can tell me scoot over not need to go to those links and it was for him and I never went back to sleep so just like. Why and. I was like so annoyed but also it's like I have it's like the thing will happen i'll have these like. Really angry like irrational thoughts like i'm pregnant i'm allowed signal that I don't care you go somewhere else. anger and then what, if I were to let it out, obviously it wouldn't go well and dad never yell back at me or if you've never like that anything really like dicey whenever I yell at him but it's like I. don't want to do that to him I don't want to. yeah through. The part of. me saying things I know I will come down from. So I think when he gets home from work tonight, and I want to eat dinner together, like the conversation of like I was frustrated because I felt like you weren't helping me, and especially in the circumstances that we're in right now. I I really hate the feeling. of being alone and trying to do something difficult by myself."
416.0,Provider,Your extra sensitive about it for sure yeah.
10070.0,Patient,"And i've also noticed a lot lately, and I don't know if this is coming with pregnancy or it's coming from like living together for a while, but I will like. innately need help to do things need help to do things like 100% do on my own, but it's like because he's here, or because I have him constantly with me things and I would normally have no issue with doing by myself, like I want his help to do it. mm hmm and I don't know if it's like. I feel like I have, I do have like more physical limitations now. And like he offers to do a ton but it's like I don't like the feeling of being dependent on somebody else, and it makes me a little like uneasy when I just like automatically don't try and do something, myself and just like go to ask."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean part of it is like you're you're actually exercising what I was hoping, you would exercise right which is asking for help, more often and letting people a lot like trusting people so when he doesn't come through when you need it, when you do actually asked for help. it's going to feel more it's going to have pack a bigger punch right it's going to be way more meaningful."
10070.0,Patient,"yeah and I think for me like it's so high up there on the importance it's with everything with us. If I can show him or, if I can communicate, something is really important to me, I need you for this he's always on board but it's like. I have to communicate the level of importance, something is, for me, if it's if i'm like hey can you take the trash out sometime this week, something like that low importance he will do it. And like do it on his own timeline but if I communicate hey I need this done right now, can you please help me with this always on board. So it's I but it's it's hard, because I want him to just know, and I know that that's not feasible, all the time, but it's like. I don't always want to have to communicate certain things that I need to you, I just want you to help me with us."
416.0,Provider,"And then yeah and. You need help, reinforcing I mean it like it might even be worth saying like I i'm trying to develop new patterns, please help me reinforce them right, I was."
10070.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I don't know if it would help for him to actually hear that so that he places the proper amount of importance on it.
10070.0,Patient,"yeah like it's very hard for me to ask for help. mm hmm and it takes a toll on me, every time I do ask for help, and it also takes some particle I mean when you aren't receptive. When i'm out because."
416.0,Provider,When you perceive him as being not receptive.
10070.0,Patient,Because then it's like it my irrational brain goes to I will never ask you for anything ever again.
416.0,Provider,Right right right.
10070.0,Patient,"And like satisfaction of doing things by myself is also so reinforcing to where it's like no I got it like don't need your help, thanks, though, what thanks for writing me off, and now I want you to feel bad because I did it right, and you didn't do."
416.0,Provider,"That you become the martyr I mean it's also an opportunity for you guys to connect in a deeper way. Right to really form a deeper partnership and that it be right, like when you ask for something and somebody comes through you ask for something and somebody comes through it's like. i'm going to demonstrate a little vulnerability and every time that you come through when i'm demonstrating that vulnerability and it sort of reinforces that you're saying. yeah that I can be vulnerable around you and vice versa right like he. you're giving him the message that you're trusting him every time you show some vulnerability with him. So those like it's an opportunity for you guys to really, really deepen your relationship, and so, when you talk to him about it being able to. come from that angle to right because you're about to embark on like this really big thing together you're a little freaked out and scared naturally. Because of the unknown and everybody else's to right i'm sure he feels the same way and so really deepening your relationship tend to be a solid as possible going into that and know that you guys can count on one another. yeah when things get tough when the dog freaks out and draws blood and eats peanut butter yeah."
10070.0,Patient,"I think it's also difficult because. I. He he and I gotten to a really big fight, I think, before I even started with therapy and. He was like great all you need to do is ask for help, but it was all these things that are both of our responsibilities to do that, we. should not be asking for help, you are not helping me, you are lead, you are taking care of our home, but this isn't my job solely and I do not need to ask you to help me to do your job."
416.0,Provider,Like yes.
10070.0,Patient,"I think that finally clicked with him that I shouldn't ask you to do every single little thing. You need to have the functioning to clean up after yourself, you should have the functioning to do all of the things that I just do. And I think he hadn't realized how much I actually do until you like outline it but also, and he doesn't say this, but I know not that I know that he thinks it, but I know that he does it. He makes most of the money in our family he worked so hard so it's like all these abstract things that he does, and contributes to. That you can see all the concrete things, and you can also see what doesn't get done but you don't I don't see who pays the light bill I don't see who pays the mortgage I don't see all of those things."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10070.0,Patient,"So it's like he's never said this, but I know that he thinks it because it's true it's totally true I feel like in his head is probably like well i'm take care he could have come right back and say I take care of this, this this this and this that I do not ask for any help for. That I do ask to be praised for. And even like I make a point to tell him when he's working hard or I make a point to. Feed him or like do all of these things that make it a little bit easier for him that I can do. So it's also when I have all these irrational thoughts I bring myself back down to Denver it's really hard to and like you have to keep that in your brain and not be. So critical of him because he can't physically see all the things that he does too so like sometimes I will get in legit arguments with him in my brain and then. not be mad at him anymore, because I know that he's not lazy he doesn't he doesn't just slack off he doesn't not care about our family he's busy too and. it's just difficult because in a perfect world, we would make the same amount of money and we work, the same hours and we both take care of our family but that's not."
416.0,Provider,"And the reality is it's all a lot right, so no matter how you divide things I mean it best to divide things in ways that feel fair but even even when you divide it in whatever perfect way it is both of you are probably still kind of feel overburden to some extent it's a lot."
10070.0,Patient,"yeah because it is a lot and. Both of our levels of. Our threshold of certain things defer to so it's like what feels dirty in our House to me doesn't feel dirty in our House to him. it's just difficult to balance well with the knowing that there's going to be a huge curveball in our relationship and also like when we have this conversation tonight, I also want to open it up to i'm feeling insecure about us having a baby, because if I feel like. I can't you won't show up and help when I need you, how do I know you'll show up and help when I need you with a baby but also. it's the same concept I don't want to ask for your help for all of the things with the baby, because the baby's not 100% my responsibility at all times, but I think the conversation of like I genuinely might need to like schedule, you will do back time I will do this, we together. So that."
416.0,Provider,Will lot of people do that.
10070.0,Patient,"yeah i've seen it to or have the open line of communication, like hey i'm too tired or I have to work tonight, or how to do this. yep that's fine with me as long as it's not just like the blatant disregard of like oh I just assumed you were doing."
416.0,Provider,Right right.
10070.0,Patient,I think drives me insane.
416.0,Provider,"I think, having. Definitely having you know designated roles, I mean not only not only is it helpful for you guys it, but it also gives each of you kind of your own special time with the baby. To like bond and connect and it can develop your own little special ways of doing things and, of course, that it's going to need to be flexible if something has to work or somebody gets sick or whatever, but. But I think it's really healthy approach right and talking about that in advance which most people don't do it's also really healthy like what kinds of things are you looking forward to doing. Because we're not, no, no one of us is going to be able to do everything so are you looking forward to bath time, are you looking forward to bedtime like what parts, do you like the best."
10070.0,Patient,"And I even think like there's going to be a much heavier learning curve for him than for me. Like growing up the other siblings if babysitting doing all that kind of stuff so I don't want him to get like bogged down in the or like overwhelmed with how much it's going to be and, like, I feel adequately prepared for. The thought of like a newborn is a lot and he's like oh no we got it like. Okay, like i'm really happy with your optimism, but like it's a lot and."
416.0,Provider,A lot.
10070.0,Patient,"I think he's just so like happy go lucky, at times, where it's like. Okay okay yeah. We communicated to me that he's very overwhelmed with a lot of things in life and, like, I very much reinforce like thank you for telling me, I want to like be there for you, if there's anything that I can do anything small anything big like that you know. So it's like on top of Sometimes I get fresh in for small things it's like. The empath in me is like he's overwhelmed with school he's tired he wants a break, he wants to sit down and relax for a minute and. it's difficult being angry with someone when you know that they are just trying their best."
416.0,Provider,"Yes. Can I give you the one and only mommy tip i'm ever going to give you. Unless you want more, this was a game, this was a game changer for me. So i'm worst thing in the world for me in that with the baby was trying to cut their nails I hated it more than anything, I inevitably drew blood, it was horrible it was traumatic for all of us. My son's dad couldn't do it, but then I found the key and I give this to all new mommies so let me i'm gonna look it up hold on the key are this ditch the stupid baby scissors or the baby clippers as their like their death traps, as far as i'm concerned and get these what are they called. hold on yeah get a good pair of these i'm going to show you. My screen just one second. There, like the cuticle clippers or whatever."
10070.0,Patient,Oh does.
416.0,Provider,"Adult cuticle clippers because you have so much more control, you can actually explain it under their nail. And you come in from the side, instead of from the top, so you don't like. off the top of their finger, you can slide it in from the side of my clip I still use them here i'll share my screen, these are these are game changers for me once I got this I was like oh i'm an expert I got this yeah just like simple little pair of these."
10070.0,Patient,oprah i'm just gonna work so i'm on Amazon.
416.0,Provider,Okay best that in a white noise machine.
10070.0,Patient,I have um i'd like fully completed our registry and very like intense with it and it's really funny because Dan like very much enjoys like. I don't know if this is the right term of trolling people like he just loves like little like Easter eggs and things and on our baby registry he put in under the for the parents column a casual Rolex and I was like.
416.0,Provider,You told me this.
10070.0,Patient,"you're going to sandwich it between nipple butter and. Breast ads for you, I was like Okay, and when people text me oh my God."
416.0,Provider,"All right, Miss grace we're about out of time, you want to schedule something. So my schedule is getting a little bit trickier. But, so my evening appointments are mostly going away, but I will have some exceptions and. Starting November, but in October, well, I mean technically starting halfway through October, but that's well anyway long story and so i'm looking at October 18 but it's four o'clock too early for you or will that work."
10070.0,Patient,I believe we're going to be.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so four o'clock on October 18 would be okay. yeah okay. I will put you in there. Okay. And so, then we should be all set. How are those eminem's for making me hungry."
10070.0,Patient,I like.

10070.0,Patient,sounds perfect.
416.0,Provider,"All right, good luck with your conversation tonight."
10070.0,Patient,"Thank you so much, I will not have anxiety about it i'm just gonna have a conversation."
416.0,Provider,yeah it's all about coming together and solving problems together. it's a problem solving session it's not a conversation.
10070.0,Patient,it's just an easy day it's just a dinner.
416.0,Provider,"with us. Alright, have a good one."
