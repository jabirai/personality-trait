ID,Role,Message
13017.0,Patient,i'm really genuinely so sorry I I had called them last week and I left a message and I told somebody I really need someone to explain to me how to do this every week because. i'm going in early and i'm not getting it done. yeah like i'm having a panic attack every week.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so carrie. mm hmm you're here now. yeah i'm going to help with that, but we do have a goal to accomplish."
13017.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"If we don't because we're 25 minutes, and this is a two hour assessment that I that I have to do in an hour and we just missed 25 minutes of it."
13017.0,Patient,let's I will figure out how to do the zeal. With the other people don't worry i'll help you.
105.0,Provider,"i'll help you, but today let's start with getting that phone set down because i'm going to end up throwing up if this is emotion, the whole time so so. let's find a place to land. And we'll begin there, so I know it's not ideal, but let's go ahead and seize this moment and still reach the goal Okay, so we can still actually get done. What we started off to do and that is get this assessment done and then. we'll probably i'll probably end up having to call you a little later because I won't be able to accomplish it, but I want to give you some tricks that will make it possible for us to move through this assessment so here it is. kinda but watch it's really specific i'm going to be asking you questions where you're going to be wanting to explain why you're going to long to want to give me a story, but I want you to hold back and just give me what i'm asking for so you're going to hear me say when when was the. Age of first shoes and how much how often and you're going to give me that you're going to want to say why, but then you're going to remember Oh, I get to talk to her. comfortably in a relaxed way, the next time we meet So if you hear me say okay let's let's just answer just this question it's, not because I don't care and it's not because it's not important it's because we won't be able to accomplish the goal today. And it will get easier, this is going to be an easy program in the sense that, once the switch goes off and you really get what these numbers are and how to do it if you're going to exhale and it's going to get easier and I want to help with that, but let's do it let's do it. Immediately yeah okay. yeah we're going to dive in.
