6231.0,Patient,"and Well, in my personal life, things were pretty bad. Sorry um. As far as at school. I had this teacher that didn't like me, and so, when I would raise my hand to ask questions she told me it wasn't time for questions and she would never helped me and come to find out, it was my mom's old gym teacher that didn't locker well. And, and the reason the only reason I didn't get in trouble is because we move, I was there for five six weeks, and the last six weeks, I went to Adrian burnett and I made straight a's Okay, but it was because. Like people helped me like. Okay it's weird like the only way I know to describe it is I tell people i'm the smartest thing he person, you will ever meet. It takes me a minute to get something, but once I have it i'm good. But I procrastinate procrastinate a lot and I hate it. Okay, I like to be organized and i'm a little OCD but. it's like there's a whole bunch of different tasks and I can't figure out which one, I want to start on first and. i'll just do the math and trying to decide. It sucks really bad. yeah."
499.0,Provider,So you've never you've never been treated. For ADHD correct.
6231.0,Patient,"Well, no, I haven't but here's my problem I went to I go to hell and Ross mcnabb for my mental health. Okay Okay, and I went to them. When I took that test. And you know explained what the situation was and what she was recommended. and Because her recommendation was adderall because all the other medications that they try, first, I have been on for depression."
499.0,Provider,Okay.
6231.0,Patient,"And so we knew that that didn't work, you know, and so that was why she had recommended that and I tried to explain that to them, and this lady basically told me that. Because. i'm on suboxone she doesn't think it's a good idea to put me on that, but then she tells me. Because I was, I was trying to explain to her, I was like look I need to be able to get a job I need to be able to work and it kind of requires you know, being able to perform tasks on time and stuff. You know she don't have time to just stop and think about it, you got to be able to do it, you know and like she basically told me if I was working at the end, and it was interfering with my job she would she would prescribe it to me, but because i'm. Because I didn't have a job, then she just wouldn't won't prescribe it to me and I said. So let me get this straight have said you're discriminating on me, because I am a recovering addict i've been clean for over seven years and. peppers like that was never my thing I got addicted to pain pills, because I took them like I was supposed to. I mean you know I had an issue with my pregnancy, I had a calcium deficiency and so after I had my first child and it would just crumble and fall apart. It hurt in order to eat once a day I took backfill a 10 milligram pane view and got a date, and I was addicted for a long time and I got in trouble and went to prison for two years. And then I realized that that wasn't the LIFE I wanted and so. I got hill i've been in therapy for over a year now. With the same place, you know i'm saying like I. Am really proud of myself."
499.0,Provider,"You know, you should. And you should and you should be but just to piggyback off of what you say it's just um the laws in certain States they're just so stringent that it just makes it very you know."
6231.0,Patient,"Different one or. Two that I understood I kind of gotten that one, but the second thing was my problem you basically tell me if I had a job right. Now I had just told her I needed this medication, so I could hold a job down and she told me if he was working right now, because. I was. At home mom plus I have back pain, which is the only reason I even started taking the suboxone To begin with, I had been clean for years it was either that or pain pills, and I chose the lesser evil, I mean you know I had two kids and i've been stuck five times with the epidural needle. My back is bad, you know. And so I had to have some them to be able to get up and move around, I was walking around like I was a 90 year old lady. So that was the only reason I even chose to do that, to begin with, and so that kind of made me feel like she was you know i'm saying."
499.0,Provider,"yeah I do, but I just also I i've been on both ends of those spectrum, so I kind of you know, know in areas. That he has certain you know certain rules and guidelines that they kind of fall."
6231.0,Patient,He told me that this was her. This was.
499.0,Provider,"yeah even as a provider people have your own personal preference of how they prescribe narcotic medications though it's not really writer, you know writer."
6231.0,Patient,"Was. it's hard to explain, if I can explain to you the way she treated me, I think you would understand when I came out of the office, I was in tears okay. Talk to the guy the desk and apparently she had a lot of complaints on her I filed a grievance and everything it was a serious situation it wasn't no because of this or that she literally looked down on us, because you see what i'm saying, she was. Okay person in a job that she shouldn't have been in because she had no compassion. It was."
