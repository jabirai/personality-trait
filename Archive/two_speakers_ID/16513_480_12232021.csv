ID,Role,Message
480.0,Provider,hi. How are you.
16513.0,Patient,getting a bit of a headache and i'm trying to stave it off by sipping on fluids.
480.0,Provider,"Well, there you go that's good."
16513.0,Patient,Well yeah.
480.0,Provider,Are you still dog sitting.
16513.0,Patient,I am. yeah today's been busy some pet sitting for the family who tell me that and then i'm also I also walk the dog this in a neighborhood and then a former landlord of mine. pays me whenever. i'm upward to go and put eyedrops in his semi estranged elderly dad's eyes.
480.0,Provider,interesting.
16513.0,Patient,yeah really random gigs. wow. yeah so.
480.0,Provider,"Tell me a little bit about we're supposed to be doing like your whole history, but because you have this issue that you're talking about yesterday, I want to make sure we touch on that, so the personal assistant type of job for. Is it the guy your House sitting for."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah it's have a husband in the in the family that i'm house sitting for and. i've known them for. The I don't know a couple of years, two years, maybe we know if it's like two and a half, something like that and. So i've been pet sitting for them, but then also i've been walking their dog, just like once a week. When I was pet sitting for a neighbor who I met through this family over the summer. Their dog the other family their dog and this dog going here. The one here has it has her own trauma history and she tends to be pretty reactive to other dogs and then neighbors one is a buddy of hers. And so. getting them togethers typically it's like it's good for her for sure, and so my husband, the his family was out on vacation so he and his dog, and I am the one I was watching, we would meet up in the evenings and walked both of them together. And that's how we became. Like he and I got to know each other more because he was we were talking, while we walk the dogs and, to some degree that's continued. Since that period of time, so when I come, once a week to get this one, the husband if he's available will typically join us for I don't know, maybe like sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes of an hour long walk."
480.0,Provider,Is a Platonic relationship.
16513.0,Patient,"That is something that has crossed my mind at times. I mean, it is absolutely Platonic for me and. And I imagine you know, like I think any initial motives on his end would be purely Platonic but as another therapist of mine pointed out who is asking the same thing he's like you know when affairs happens sometimes they people just kind of fall into them like. Relationships change over time. You know, I think. I can't tell if there's any of. The husband as any of those feelings lingering the hasn't made a hit on me hasn't made any mirrors. Right, you know, like, I do wonder."
480.0,Provider,I was just asking because I didn't know if that plays into the whole hesitation to take this job.
16513.0,Patient,"that's part of it yeah i've done. Other jobs, like the last one I had before that it's like when I decided to really step away from working in mental health was as someone's personal assistant who i've met through pet sitting. I also after I graduated from college head been mostly a nanny but kind of a personal assistant for as casting director. And when you're like in people's homes there's intimacy right away, and so it's it's already really hard to have any sense of boundaries. and whatever boundaries you set up like they just fall away."
480.0,Provider,"Over time, especially yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So it's confusing and. Given. Just the fact that things haven't ended well like with the people at that last job or as a personal assistant, and then it also things didn't end well with that casting director, I mean it went well up until the very end. Now i'm i'm extra kind of apprehensive because. You know I like I struggle with definitely codependency and come from really dysfunctional family where we didn't have boundaries, not only did we not have boundaries like but there also was never repair. If there is. yeah a problem and so. that's tricky because I always feel like i'm risking losing I can risk losing the whole relationship yeah."
480.0,Provider,So talk to me about no boundaries growing up. at all. Where your parents more like friends figures.
16513.0,Patient,"No, I mean, I guess, no boundaries, even in that when I first started therapy my freshman year of high school or college. The therapist who I saw starting over the summer, when I returned home first kind of introduced me to the concept of boundaries. And I was just like what. And we had to go through, and she was like. You know, having to kind of like re helped me relearn things and even I remember our first. On this lesson or rehearsal of a boundary is just like if someone asks you a question. Like I was stuck in a pattern of when it's still hard if guys wanted my number and I felt like I had to give it to them, because they asked for it. And that I couldn't say no. And so she's like it doesn't matter what someone asks you. buy yourself some time even just even if you are going to answer the question and just an ask and respond to the request with, why do you ask, and I remember telling my mom about that, and she was kind of horrified she's like that's so rude. Oh, my gosh and that stood out to me is like. If they if there's something that's really big that i've been missing."
480.0,Provider,yeah for sure.
16513.0,Patient,"yeah and so like growing up, you know, having to go to dances in middle school or even in high school with people I didn't who had asked me because they asked me, I had no agency. I couldn't hurt their feelings. And that led for really awkward experiences that were uncomfortable than I think for both of us. By yeah like you just. don't know it. I still have a very strong knee jerk. way of relating to people in that I. If someone. wants something from me then. i'm automatically reacting to it one way or the other. Whether. You know, and even now if i'm not behaviourally giving them what they want there's still a huge internal reaction. And, and I bet like the absence of boundaries is probably a big part of the burnout. That I had like working in mental health."
480.0,Provider,Is that why you stopped working and mental health burnout.
16513.0,Patient,"yeah like severe compassion fatigue. Secondary trauma like I never just feeling. The word. Oh, my God i'm blinking where your there's disillusioned. With like everything in the system and just. The sense that, like an analogy that I give is if. You know my undergrad degree was actually in sociology and anthropology, and so we looked at a lot of systems things like you know, and not just the individual and. That changed how i've looked at the world, but also, I feel like there's you know, a machine or several machines that are just churning out people who are. wounded and exploited and struggling and the NHS doesn't end and what I want to do more than anything is blow up the machine. And it hurts too much to see. What people like what how we treat each other. And how are our systems and how we individually fail each other and to be a part of it, and just feel like I can't make it stop. And I think. You know. Particularly level it wasn't until I left. My last job and mental health. and got a little bit of distance from supporting other people. They they helped me actually connect more with my own issues with my own history. Because I would always when Scott, the therapist i've been working with her, you know four and a half years had asked me about trauma and i'm like I don't have trauma like. What about all these stories, you know, like what i've been through so nothing in comparison to this stuff and. I yeah getting some distance from. From the role of needing to be functional so that I can support other people has helped me realize just how much i'm struggling and what i'm dealing with and then, when I went on to residential and. Immediately everyone they're like you've got a lot of trauma i've got a lot of trauma and i'm like how maybe I do have a lot of trauma and then having like the more of the bandwidth available to look at my own stuff and be honest. yeah I guess I don't I don't feel like I have the stability and bandwidth to support and hold other people's issues. Because I don't feel stable enough yeah. And yeah people talk about like. You know, filling up your cup right, so you can it can overflow and other people, I feel like my cup has like. Like it's got a massive crack in it and it doesn't even I can't even collect the fluid that it needs."
480.0,Provider,So how long ago were you in residential.
16513.0,Patient,"A year ago. mid September until late October, and then I switched from there to a boarded php I up in southern California. And that ended December 26 of last year."
480.0,Provider,And that was mainly trauma related both of those.
16513.0,Patient,um I mean it was I ended up in residential after a third of boarded suicide attend.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
16513.0,Patient,and
480.0,Provider,A third is how long of a time period.
16513.0,Patient,"Like a year and a half. and I we had talked about residential before my treatment providers for questioning whether or not they thought it would be helpful. I was at a point where i'm like I. You know I go from this. aborted attempt right back to this job that was super triggering were reminded me a lot of my family stuff and I just. I couldn't handle I couldn't pretend like it like I hadn't almost just died and. So feeling just beyond overwhelmed and not having much of a support system. yeah I did tell my I did tell Scott, at the time them like I feel like someone else needs to be making the decisions right now and he's like well, it sounds like now's the time then for residential and the hope would hope was that I would go to a place where I would feel. Really really safe and like be able to D compensate in ways that I. hadn't allowed myself to do because I don't feel like I have the luxury of falling apart because there's just me to keep the pieces together. And unfortunately that is not what my experience was and residential is kind of the opposite you actually have to add add to advocate for myself. Everyone does relentlessly and it's exhausting. So I didn't get what I what I wanted needed in that aspect but I got other stuff that I hadn't realized that I needed. and"
480.0,Provider,So where are you as far as suicidal ideation on a daily basis.
16513.0,Patient,"I mean, I think about death and stuff related to death. You know, probably fleetingly at least once a day. My. What I really realized. With the third aborted attempt in particular was that I didn't want to be the one to do it and I. Have a very elaborate plan. If I ever went through with it like it, I know, it would be legal because there are four different methods, just to be very thorough. But by the goal that I had in instead is to do medically assisted suicide so like medical aid and dying through an organization in Switzerland. called dignitas and there are a number of reasons, so. That is a whole process of like you have to apply, and you have to get approved and that takes a minimum of three months and it's really expensive, and you know. It sounds like from their own materials that like 80% of the people who are approved never use it, they just feel better, knowing that they have that option. So."
480.0,Provider,For this.
16513.0,Patient,"I have not applied, I became a Member. pay the fees. I have worked on the application I haven't worked on it in a long time I haven't worked on it in about a year."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
16513.0,Patient,"But yeah it's. yeah the application, I mean most there's still some stuff I would need to finish up and then you have to gather all of your records and stuff but how I left. residential and then my php I O P was like like i'm not saying that suicides entirely off the table and like that I don't have that issue, but it's i'm more curious about seeing where treatment can take me like and what I can do with it. The ptsd diagnosis, you know that was near that was a big paradigm shift yeah I liked the somatic stuff it felt like I. Finally, connected with with like a language that really speaks to me. So it's more the curiosity and just wanting to keep going in pursuing that so it's not that i'm saying yes to life, I still struggle with a lot of ambivalence about being alive. That comes up a lot in treatment some providers, like in in residential and and the other program some of them are like whoa you can't do you can't be successful in therapy if you're not if you are still ambivalent about being alive and you just have to like let that go. And I. think that i'm sorry man like that's backwards to me is. Now it took experiences for me to get to this point. And so to tell me that it's it's on my shoulders to just give up what feels like my ultimate freedom. From my perspective does not sound like a good deal right. So."
480.0,Provider,"No Okay, let me ask do you have a current safety plan as far as like. Like support people numbers to call, if you like, Okay, so I guess i'm i'm struggling because i've never had this experience of like if you were going to do it, it would be three months anyways it's not like an impulsive decision."
16513.0,Patient,Though i'm not impulsive.
480.0,Provider,"So okay so safety plan wise I feel like. Like you know crisis hotline numbers like that's usually what we do safety plan right is make sure your environment safe make sure if you were going to do it by firearm you don't own any firearms those kinds of things, but with you it's more like let's. let's get some sort of accountability around like the application. So if you were ever to pick up the application and start filling that out again I feel like that would need to put us into a place of needing a more solid safety plan does that make sense."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah I mean part. I mean, I can let you i've always been honest, you know with providers like and side like yeah you know i've been working on the thing that I hate about the application and probably what has prevented me from submitting it over a year ago year and a half ago is. That they want like. It basically a some sort of autobiography of your significant life experiences, and that is just so vague noxious. I hate that assignment passionately. And so that's what i've been struggling with and that's why I haven't applied. Part of me is curious if they would even if they would approve me or not, you have to be assessed by their. psychiatry and their people and. yeah like the the kit of stuff that I have like, for my own plan is not my immediate possession it's in a storage unit like. 45 minutes away."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so is that the aborted plan is where the kit came from. yeah okay yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"The last. The last aborted attempt I i'm tempted to say is was a bit impulsive. There was weird I was going out of town just for like a weekend, just to be by the ocean, so I love, a mother Ocean and the night before I left. I don't have auditory hallucinations or any sort of delusional stuff but they're just kind of like. A thought or almost like a message from within that was just like you should bring your kit with you. And I was doing laundry and i've been helping out a neighbor who've been in an emergency and I was just like well that's kind of like that was not the intention of this trip like. kind of interesting that's kind of weird. Like whatever i'll sleep on it, and the next day i'm getting ready to go and i'm like i'm noticing i'm not having that thought is not on my mind at all, no urge like Okay, and I got in the car and started on my merry way and but then it bothered me enough they I turn my car around. And went back and got it, because just have this very strong like it is important that you have this."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
16513.0,Patient,"And so the whole time i'm like i'm not sure what exactly is happening and what my intention is. And the plan then was, like all right well at the very least than I could do if I don't end up going through with us all new all the way. At the very least I can record it all is like a dress rehearsal and submitted as part of my application. So that is what I ended up doing. and"
480.0,Provider,"Right, I mean when you say didn't go all the way through with it did you like go partially. Did you start."
16513.0,Patient,"um did I start taking those anti emetic. I probably didn't take some of the anti emetic so the stuff that prevents you from puking. And I had everything set up like setting it all up takes a long time and it's emotionally draining I remade the videos to my family and friends. I. signed up for a membership with the funeral co op and was researching though local. Like funeral homes in the area and trying to like leave add to this binder that I have for my family and just like hey you know i'm a Member of this now and make sure to use this account. know is part of filming it I have like. an exit bag and so like again having it all set up I almost thought about going to my car and. Thought I think I might have had some tools, I wanted to like take the screens off the things off the windows, so that I could open them more to let the air vent out because I didn't want anyone to risk getting sick. From the nitrogen, if any, nitrogen leaked out of the bag and into the room, I was worried that people could walking because the windows wouldn't open more than like an inch on either side."
480.0,Provider,"So that was where you were very rational, you were in a seat when all this was happening. Yes, yeah okay. And it's interesting that you were thinking about the other people and having to clean up and everything."
16513.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I have caution tape, I have a sign that I made a day i've been taped to the walls, you know and like by the door, so that if you open the door, this is all based on my first attempt which also was in a hotel or near attempt, so it, it is set up, so that it tells people like stop. Go call 911. tell them that there's a body and that nitrogen gas was used. And like like I apologize i've got letters for the medical examiner. So I."
480.0,Provider,All of this stuff in your storage unit. yeah okay.
16513.0,Patient,"i've got like absorbent padding and my own sheets, because I know things get messy. wow yeah."
480.0,Provider,So okay. talk to me about when did all of this planning actually start like How long have you been in the planning phases of suicide.
16513.0,Patient,"Well, the first near attempt was march of 2019. The next one was August 2019 and then the last one was July 2020. gosh I think i'd been in the planning for the March, you know because. Almost all of it was from March was for that whole thing i've been planning that for. Many, many months. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"not yours, though, so this is all more recent."
16513.0,Patient,"That specific plan, oh no, you know what actually it was yours, because it was in 26. teen July 6 of 2016 God I haven't thought about this in a while I made a pact with myself. I was. getting ready to come back from a soul searching trip in Ireland and felt really disillusioned by something that happened in American politics and was like you know what i'm not feeling, you know this was a soul searching trip for two and a half months i'm still not feeling good about. about anything, what if I how about I give agree to give myself one year to try to sort this out and like come up with a plan and a path for my life to make this worthwhile and if not, then I will give myself permission to it and."
480.0,Provider,So do packs work well for you like agreements and packs.
16513.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean. What happened. I ended. I feel I don't know how I feel telling you this. The the March. situation because of my work in the field, I know, with Neil, there are lines and that. Where you're obligated to. To report your vein. And then there are lines where you. are not yet you know you can't report. And what I did in order to protect my therapist. Was I terminated treatment. But I, and I did well before. The Near attempt so i'm still ambivalent at the time that I terminated. And, but I did not want him to either be obligated or be capable of in voluntarily detaining me I didn't have all of the stuff yet. and So yeah that's. And I called them from the hotel random I drove I drove from Washington to Oregon. I had stopped off at his office before on my way out of town."
480.0,Provider,Did you want him to stop.
16513.0,Patient,"You after is off the cliff no. that's why, but I just dropped off like a video that I had recorded for him. And when I called him from. This hotel in another state. You know, he was great, and you know he didn't it would have been not i'm not sure how he would have traced my phone in the other state, and that would have been hard. And we just talked and I was really tired from. Making the videos I hadn't even finished them and I just felt emotionally exhausted from just the adrenaline and he's like i'm going to bed you sound tired how about like how about we both get some sleep. yeah and call me tomorrow and I did. and And then the hotel, I wanted to extend my stay there, they were full there wasn't room anywhere else and and i'm like when do you leave your office like when's your last appointment today and he's like how soon can you get here. And I got in the car and drove back up."
480.0,Provider,So what prompted you to call him from the hotel. Fear of dying.
16513.0,Patient,"fear of being alone. yeah fear of what it would be like fear of what would happen fear of I hadn't done the dress rehearsals which were recommended and i'm like no Now I know why i'm afraid of having a bag over my head i'm afraid of. Is it going to hurt, is it going to be scary What if you know, like. I. said i've titled before but there's something about the build up to all of it felt like so much pressure it's like now or never and he just. I was surprised by how much I didn't want to be alone so. that's. that's why. I put him through some tough stuff."
480.0,Provider,Are you still working with him.
16513.0,Patient,"We are, and so that's something that I need to ask you about. So. it's a bit tricky I adore Scott, we have a very good relationship, he is not a trauma specialist his. background is like psycho analytics psycho dynamic very relational if there's one thing I could change about our work together, it would be having him be more like trauma focused. I have been working with someone who is a trauma specialist named Shannon i've had to cut back on the number of sessions, that I seen both of them because of changes in insurance. And there will be some changes on some of that again soon, it was itching this happens, I get this hasn't happened since I was in php. And for some reason, talking about stuff like intense emotional stuff makes my face. And the people there said they thought it was. fun, is it. What the heck."
480.0,Provider,"No, I know, listen i'm gonna tell you there is a literally. Your body so here's sorry my dogs coughing got laid off. Myself, I know."
16513.0,Patient,homeless guy.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so with. With ptsd what happens, a lot of times is your okay so, especially if you've had ptsd untreated for so long you've probably been super hyper vigilant and your. auto immune system is fighting your anxiety, basically, is like how I like to think of it right so like you're. not consciously anxious, but when you're in that fight or flight mode and all your muscles are tense and your your that like adrenaline cortisol all of that causes your immune system to basically. What I had it explained to me it's basically like you have an autoimmune disease and it starts attacking itself so then all of these weird symptoms can happen, such as like rashes or flushing of skin or all of that yeah it's. I mean. i'm not saying that that's 100%. Like accurate, but for me and a lot of people, I know that have ptsd we all get weird rashes like mine are under my arms I get like really weird rashes under my arms when my ptsd is highly active. and"
16513.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean, I do have an autoimmune disease and so just my sister. And i've had issues yeah with weird rashes some of those I think started in high school. yeah when I was in California this treatment places like what's up with this room that we would do our meetings and i'm like I just my face itches i'm gonna get sensor tech and like popping is our tech like it's not helping. They can it's probably the cortisol because your body's like."
480.0,Provider,alarms are going off.
16513.0,Patient,It well and then part of that is confusing if it's still pretty contained right and very like innocent and innocuous like oh just my nose is itching you think if I feel like i'm under attack that. My body might show it more. When.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I feel like a big but okay wait back to all these therapists that you have. So what specifically did you come to break heart for was the trauma stuff."
16513.0,Patient,"it's. going to be some trauma stuff. So I will have been trying to find someone to do em Dr I. First, experienced that in residential and also got to do it, and my php program and it went really well. I didn't realize until later that their approach is considered like kind of not traditional. And when I tried it in them very traditional way, we are working like explicit memories and stuff that was actually overwhelming, and it was too much and. Part of it might have been at that provider was a man I don't know if that's an issue this is before the sexual stuff the abuse memory fragments came up."
480.0,Provider,And up until that the memory so sexual abuse memory fragments like you had no recollection of that at all until you are in residential.
16513.0,Patient,"Actually I didn't it's been long speculated about like ever since I started therapy people have assumed and asked about it, but I had no concrete memories, or even anything, it was just a very much like I don't know, maybe, probably, and then in September. I in a guided imagery session had what Shannon causes somatic flashback I guess and more stuff has come up since then."
480.0,Provider,"flashback was all body like you felt it in your body, no conscious memory."
16513.0,Patient,"Oh. Well, no, it was like. More so kind of like imagery i'll i'll get both it's more of like a sense of memes like yuckiness when just like yeah can like it kind of a get away from me, but. What. In that session like yeah I didn't see the face of a person like whoever the person was, but it was. God i'm assuming that my mind. i'm assuming that the stick that I was envisioning was probably a penis because. I was just like ha I don't know whether or not. He the other person is impaled on it, or if i'm impaled on it, or we both are but then there's like a sense of like wetness on my thigh oh Oh, and then the memory of. The person sucking on my foot like like sucking on my toes and my left foot. But yeah like being in a puddle of like kind of. Like clear liquid being hurt being alone like them being like left alone. yeah and. Having to like kind of. Going in hiding somewhere. There any."
480.0,Provider,memory of like how old you were.
16513.0,Patient,"well. I think I was pretty freakin young there was also a memory something else of like a bunch of bushes and scroll them like in the Bush is I think it's possible that there might have been more than one person. By in another session. What comes up and you can probably see you'd like to discuss it's. Like look on my face the. One of the people, someone who i've. You know long presumed. it's it's like his voice talking to me using language that people use for like potty training, you know for body parts. Okay um. yeah so I mean I think we're talking like."
480.0,Provider,Like really very.
16513.0,Patient,yeah mm hmm.
480.0,Provider,Is this family member.
16513.0,Patient,"yeah he's dead, thank God, I mean I remember being relieved when i'd heard, who died because when I was older I have memories of him being dangerous."
480.0,Provider,it's actually threatening oh wow okay.
16513.0,Patient,"My I have an older sister and. We would see him at when we go to North Carolina where my mom's from and he would we had a beach cottage there, and he and his mom he's he's my mom's he that's her cousin. They would often come join us and. And my sister and I had like went down one morning to breakfast and we said to our parents my brothers or two were like please do not invited him here like we do not feel safe. And they laughed and. Making too big, of a deal of it, and my sister is the sexual abuse survivor as well. So. I have a. Car long history of being harassed sexually harassed and threatened by. People in power like. girl I grew up with her dad and for four years, every year of high school by a teacher."
480.0,Provider,Your teacher for four years.
16513.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,And thanks for asking my parents.
16513.0,Patient,"for help with that, like and being told not to make a big deal of things and don't rock the boat and."
480.0,Provider,So do you feel like have he has anyone ever brought up the possibility of people's responses to your trauma also being traumatic.
16513.0,Patient,"yeah um I mean, I guess, we. pretty much people brought that up or in relation to my family and. that's one of the hard things is. So i'm the youngest of three my brother's a middle child and our parents are just they've never been protective of me or my sister. They are of our brother and and yeah it's heartbreaking and and just awful to grow up feeling like you have to fend for yourself in the world, even when you're a little kid and. I mean my sister scotty been some worst stories because she remembers what our mom was like. in ways that I don't when our mom was actively drinking both of both of my parents are alcoholics but my mom's been sober for several new for many years now. And, and it wasn't until I told my siblings. This fall about the abuse memories that are coming up that my sister shared with me ways she's six years older she's like I tried to protect you. From uncle Larry. When we were at the beach like I knew he was a predator, I would take you out in the ocean and try and keep you, you know just away from him. So it's yeah like it's hard. Some of the interactions with my family, to this day are traumatic because they're so invalidating. and I mean it's it's all really just kind of heartbreaking. and talking like. My dad in particular. he's. My mom is really just afraid of big feelings. But my dad is more. Really overtly narcissistic. ways. That can be kind of cruel. And there's some of that in my family as a whole. But it's yeah it's hard to be in this situation of being vulnerable like when I. You know. And needing things from them and, still a little kid me still wanting stuff from them. And they're there but they're getting old and my dad's brain is deteriorating. And so that's a big struggle to. Is. Like they're helping me they're paying for me to have access to a lawyer who can help me apply for disability. The lawyer. At my dad's words hired lawyers as well. And this be a generational thing the lawyer like. pretty much won't respond to efforts and my parents used them for other things my moms like yeah you basically have to see see my parents on the emails in order for this man to respond he's like basically only responsive if my dad's involved."
480.0,Provider,wow.
16513.0,Patient,Which i'm not used to that like that's some old school crap right there.
480.0,Provider,wow that's crazy.
16513.0,Patient,"But it sucks having to have my parents, particularly my dad involved in communications about this because. Because my dad's it just opens up. more opportunity for him to say things that will be hurtful. And that's coming up that's been coming up this week. and yeah. So it's. it's tough I don't know I feel compelled to tell you, like an example. have another tournament you know traumatic thing but. There is such a gift. When I was in high school. My mom admitted that she loved me conditionally. But. I mean, she admitted it because I had asked her. And we weren't fighting. It was very calm like and I said, you know Sometimes I get this sense that you don't love me is that true. And she's like you're right, I do love you conditionally but that's how I was raised and that's all that I know. And this is a big moment for me because I. told her that I thought that that was kind of a cop out and kind of bs because i'm just like so you're telling me that if I have kids that I have no choice that I love them conditionally that I can't learn from my own experience and do things differently. Like I don't. I don't agree with that and that's a big part of how I ended up working in mental health. that's not all of it but that's a big part of it was like. You know freewill like."
480.0,Provider,versus determinism. To believe people can change oh my gosh. And no ownership. Was she sober at the time when she said that or no. She was yeah oh wow.
16513.0,Patient,yeah. And I actually that's one of the. biggest gift she's ever given me was that moment of honesty. Because I think most people would have lied.
480.0,Provider,"yeah well and I think that it's important that you understand that, like you said she still had the choice to heal from that and do things differently or not right. And I think a lot of times it's really tricky relationships with parents, because they do cause a lot of our trauma it's just fact and so it's hard to. Separate their behaviors that caused the trauma from them as a person right, so I try to. Look at people as human being, separate from all the behaviors that things they say because that's usually all trauma responses, so if you can externalize the behaviors meaning the conditional love that's the behavior that she was taught from her parents that she's. Just never. took the time to get to the bottom of to correct So if you externalize that from her as a human being, you can kind of see this little child that desperately wanted to be loved it wasn't and didn't know what to do it. Right yeah so it's like. Being able to hold space for that compassion, but then also know that that was on you to do the work. And so it's still a wrong like i'm still hurt by that, because you didn't do the work there's a lot of holding space for totally opposing emotions that comes with dealing with trauma with family."
16513.0,Patient,"bully and what's been coming up recently Oh, I have a lot of animosity toward my own inner child and what has been coming up recently has been the animosity toward my mom's inner child and her mother's inner child, because I feel like. I you know the adult me who did not ever choose to have kiddos although most of the work i've done a mental health has been with children. I feel like i'm saddled with taking care of three children. And I don't know you know I don't know much of anything about my my great grandmother, but I know enough about yeah my mom and her mom and how all that went down. And I struggle to want to nurture any of them."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and I don't think you have to nurture all of them I think it's important to separate like yes, there are generations."
16513.0,Patient,Of.
480.0,Provider,In our children that you have to be able to recognize in order to not carry the resentment. But then also. You don't have to fix any of that.
16513.0,Patient,No. I guess i'd ideally i'd like to still be able to. To be compassionate like what you were talking about and my ability to to hold that. compassionate space and separate it can. I bet this is normal with trauma work right. Oh. I can't always hold I.
480.0,Provider,Always sometimes I just.
16513.0,Patient,Know yeah.
480.0,Provider,"And that's the thing and definitely. Also, I wonder if, because you were raised with conditional love the idea of having an emotional reaction or response towards somebody can't be the same as loving somebody right, so if i'm angry at you, does that mean I don't love you."
16513.0,Patient,Oh it's maybe that's possible I don't know if i've even let myself get to that point because yeah it's tooth. rattling to be angry with them.
480.0,Provider,Why is it so frightening because of the conditional love.
16513.0,Patient,"Because. You know. it's that kind of all or nothing. How there's there's no repair or everything's precarious and so you're just unstable there's no there's no secure attachment right. there's no sense of security at all, and the message that i've gotten. literally and figuratively, is it. That, I have to put up with with whatever is happening it's a scarcity mindset right."
480.0,Provider,Everything is scarce so that's why I have.
16513.0,Patient,Why then it's. necessary to to tolerate whatever's happening because the risk of losing the resource is too great.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, that makes a lot of sense. yeah so then okay. So for our therapy specifically so here's my thing you're still working with the other two therapists right. yeah Okay, so are do they know you're doing bright heart they're okay with having all these different pieces because that's usually an ethical issue for therapists but. yeah we all have our specific roles."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah well so that's a question that I have so right, as I was getting set up with bright heart how. It became a possible for me to do in person em Dr with a local. Community mental health. clinic. that's. Have Washington, does it. yeah and like bright heart it's not every week it's like twice a month, I guess, and so. i'm like well. That is that sounds like a good resource, or like a good option. I guess Ideally I would. I love what bright heart offers with the group and I, like, particularly when I heard that you guys were doing it based on like somatic stuff like body keeps the score and, like the stuff the topics that you've covered already are just like spot on. And, and I want to keep doing that, but it's like would bright heart even, let me just be part of the trauma group if I end up doing em Dr yeah."
480.0,Provider,"I have several trauma clients that do that, like i'm listed as the official therapist for bright heart but. We put on there because part of being in bright heart program is the groups and individuals so for the individual therapy, we just put in your chart managed by outside provider and then we. Make sure we have a release, so we can talk to each other issues come up so you don't have to be doing appointments with me at all you can just be doing the group, as long as we know that you are actually being seen by an outside provider."
16513.0,Patient,Perfect that would be great yeah.
480.0,Provider,"I would love to anybody that ever like. falls apart, you can always start seeing me then at any time, like that's not a that's not an issue at all so yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"That would be great Thank you, I mean. It kind of seems like madness to have different people around. yeah and and yeah I mean. I guess in residential right, I had a primary therapist and who also did all. Like our process groups, but then I had an emt or provider, I had a somatic experiencing provider and then you have like. All these different class lectures whatever you call them that you go to and then in the pH VIP it was a primary therapists were in groups most of the time, but then also an emt or person and. Like experiencing person, and so, ideally, people are communicating and I know that that's not the same when it's people from all these private practices and different organizations. So. yeah we can totally sale system like bright heart would be if I."
480.0,Provider,Would you be willing to sign a release of information for the end our therapists. Yes. Okay.
16513.0,Patient,sign up. For anyone okay.
480.0,Provider,"perfect, so I do already have it."
16513.0,Patient,i'm trying to.
480.0,Provider,You we might have you already signed up.
16513.0,Patient,"already have okay. Oh no because I just met with I it's been it's taken me three months to get anything hooked up with anybody, so I haven't met with this person in person we've we've only talked on the phone."
480.0,Provider,For Miami your last name.
16513.0,Patient,Is it Marshall Marshall yeah. yeah this person. Oh gosh where. Brian.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I have one sign for cheryl Marshall. My mom. The only Roi I have so. What i'm gonna do is i'm going to nail you. Did you find something else."
16513.0,Patient,"and probably to be able to multiple are on says so I just got right or person that I know after the first of the year, I should have her phone or her email somewhere. I think her name is June now. But we just yeah we haven't met yet. So it's up to you."
480.0,Provider,"i'm going to send to our allies for providers to your email, because all I do it's it's just a link that I sent, and then you fill it out, because it's in the bright heart system so i'll just send two separate ones do one for Scott and one for the new lady. And then, as long as we have on finally we don't actually have to. talk to them if they want to reach out to me and see how you're doing and group and stuff they can but because they're your main therapist i'm not going to be the one reaching out. Okay, if that's okay with you like, I can, if you ever want me to but um as long as we have them on file, then the issue is if they were to email me like you can feel free to give them my email address, and I can respond as long as we have an Roi on file yeah."
16513.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. No data.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to go ahead and send those to you and then you'll have my email because i'll send them from my bright heart email. Okay, and then, if you want to give either of those therapist my email you totally can and then i'll just put in your chart that therapies managed by outside provider and then, if you. ever want to switch and see me then just let us know."
16513.0,Patient,"Thank you, I really appreciate having access to this resource."
480.0,Provider,"yeah i'm glad you're here. You really do add a lot of value to group I always like having some insightful aware people and. Obviously, with your super helpful."
16513.0,Patient,"Well, good I mean. i'm new to being in groups and it's been really a learning curve and it's still one to be like. On this side of things, and an arm yeah I honestly had only been involved in groups in internship. Co facilitating in a juvenile detention Center with."
480.0,Provider,"General offenders, but."
16513.0,Patient,"Also, like. The juvenile sex offenders."
480.0,Provider,Oh. That was your interesting it was that.
16513.0,Patient,"yep yep. I did not want that, and I was like i'm going to hear like gonna tell me what they did and i'm gonna kill them because the person who needs my sister could have been one of those kids. But, believe it or not, that was the That was the first time, one of the only times, where I felt like I actually really made a difference. that's awesome was yeah."
480.0,Provider,"I always said, I would I would work with that population like in Grad school, a lot of people were like that's the one I would never work with. yeah I think I call it, I think it could."
16513.0,Patient,juveniles adults are for both. yeah I couldn't I couldn't work with the adults.
480.0,Provider,"I mean. Listen, I haven't done it yet, and I have my own history of that trauma so like I might be triggered day one, and not be able to work there, but mentally I can. I can get there and."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah I think. I mean, of course I don't know but I imagine more people could handle these two juveniles in. You know, maybe a lot of us assumed I would have thought anything related. To sexual offending it was just bad off the limits too much. But getting to see the light bulb turn on in their head."
480.0,Provider,"that's why I think I would like, it is because I know it's not a huge success rate. If you can even get like the slightest bit of twist in their thinking. To me, that feels like it would be really rewarding."
16513.0,Patient,"At the place where I worked in Texas, I was told that we had a 3% recidivism rate."
480.0,Provider,that's it.
16513.0,Patient,"yeah granted I think my boss got to probably handpick his kids and who knows you know if that statistic is truly out. Right, that is what I."
480.0,Provider,"came to me. Yes, yeah. yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"And I mean there, there are some kids that are where I think there's a pretty high chance that they will refund. But in the majority of them, I truly believe will not that's."
480.0,Provider,that's amazing.
16513.0,Patient,"Oh, my God that was a really yeah. yeah and thank you for helping me remember this, like, I remember. One kid one guy came up to me and was just like I don't know what you did like with this one boy, he said, but good job to see you like started off like hiding behind his hands, which is great when you're like six five you can't hide behind your."
480.0,Provider,Much.
16513.0,Patient,"know and going from there to like. greeting new kids and being like i'm going to help you work this new this program and you just got to own up to what you did, and none of none enough. It was a big turnaround. yeah that was neat."

The meeting that we did it last year, and it was right after I had discharged and it was like right before the New Year, and I remember amy the person who runs it was like she was a word, just like one word is kind of kind of be like maybe a theme or a goal for this upcoming year."
480.0,Provider,And the word I chose was courage.
