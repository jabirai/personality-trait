But it's just been hard here lightly and. It It makes me feel like. Like I can't I can't provide. and makes me feel less of a person i'm. alone now it's just.
418.0,Provider,"Why would you feel less as a person you're you're in the what tell me okay what financial strains like cuz you were doing pretty good for like you said for a while, what, what do you think changed that."

4834.0,Patient,"I really don't I don't I don't know I don't understand it, I don't I don't know. Because it's the same really amen. So. I don't know. I am. I like to be the person that i'm. That I I provide or. Not, not that I am the only one that provides but I like to be to where I can I can. Do it. i'm used to doing it all myself. And when we go when we're going without it makes me feel. It makes me feel bad. Oh no I don't know."
418.0,Provider,"So so part of it is you're used to being the one who can make it happen the provider the the one who can pull something out and everything is you know, going to be good or whatever."
4834.0,Patient,And yeah.
418.0,Provider,"Here lately you're not able to do that. Okay. yeah so so. Are your your needs met, do you think it's because is he pulling his weight like is he. You know."
4834.0,Patient,Does.
418.0,Provider,"Okay, yes, so both of you are doing your part it's just a probably doing a little extra spending, maybe."
4834.0,Patient,"yeah um yeah he does as much as I do um. We do the same, I mean. It just."
418.0,Provider,"because sometimes because you're settled in you're happy and things are going nicely what happens is. You. Get comfortable so maybe you're using more resources, like you might be eating a little more having you know. or going out a little more, you know doing things that you wouldn't normally do because it's the two of you, and if that's the case that's Okay, is it that your needs are not being met or you're not always able to do what you need you know one they do."
4834.0,Patient,"um. I just. i'm. not sure. Just. I would say. Just not being able or just like running low or. um you know, like i'll get i'll get paid here in two days. But every bit of that goes to rent so. In. which we. Then that's fine. But you know I, like, I would like to be able to. do things for him to. You know, you know i'm saying he asked for anything because he don't, but I would like to be able to do things for him."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so you just really want to be more financially stable a better able to you know, be able to do the normal things that you know couples would do for one another. yeah why. Okay, and that's that that's a good thing that's not that's not a bad thing. um so so the only thing I guess is you could scale back a little bit on things that you, you might be doing. um you could I mean I don't know if there's any openings for for a little little work not much because I think you're on disability right. mm hmm so so so there might be some part time work somewhere, you could do what you could just earn a little extra cash here and there, and. As it pertains to your living situation. What do you, what do you guys think about that the living situation. Has that gone."
4834.0,Patient,Well um. I wish I could find tomorrow to live for real honest honestly. there's no heat here.

4834.0,Patient,yeah.
418.0,Provider,"so that they can. help you give you some resources that they could they could help you with that I would. The fact that they don't have heat that that's something I don't even know what to say to that like. That shouldn't be. But. Do you have a small here here, you could choose."
4834.0,Patient,A yeah his mom bought a modest one.
418.0,Provider,that's a good thing.
4834.0,Patient,But at door I man it warms it up. Sometimes. But like. The bathroom will stay freeze and you can't get it you can't get in there and take a shower every day because it's so cold in there.
418.0,Provider,"well. Okay, so. I would, I would be heading down to job and family services to see what services they could help you with. This I definitely do that as soon as possible for sure. Okay. Does that make sense. yeah. So when you're feeling when you have feelings and thoughts of. feeling down and depressed had. What does that look like what were you what does that look like."
4834.0,Patient,um I just don't want to do nothing. at all. I don't. I feel tired all the time i'm.

4834.0,Patient,Now he helps he helps out here.
418.0,Provider,"Okay okay i'm a little concerned about the the depressed feelings, because I remember the last time you had those kinds of feelings. It wasn't good. I want you to try to get up and get over to JFS you need to be in a place where there's heat, I mean the temperature is really cold you really have to get to a place where you have some heat. And they may be able to help you help you and they may even if they say okay we'll help you and we'll put you in, say, like a different hotel or motel. If even if they did, that that would be better than where you are now, for the simple reason you could call them and say hey I know heat here and then they'd be mandated to put some heat on for you. You understand what i'm saying."
4834.0,Patient,yeah.
418.0,Provider,Does that make sense.
