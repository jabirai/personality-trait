298.0,Provider,hi there. How are you.
13247.0,Patient,"i'm okay i've been struggling the last week or two, with some depression that kind of hit a lot harder than I expected it to."
298.0,Provider,there's something going on in your life.
13247.0,Patient,not really just kind of like woke up one day and I was feeling really gone and it kind of just progressed and i've not really been able to shake it it's just kind of been lingering.
298.0,Provider,i'm house your appetite.
13247.0,Patient,"mama but it's been okay it's not been like. The best, but like i'm eating I believe twice a day set a reminder on my phone to remember to eat lunch because i've noticed i've not really been super hungry. But I know if I don't eat lunch i'll get a headache later in the afternoon so like it's. been it's not been the worst but it's not really been the best."
298.0,Provider,How was your climb on the lamictal any side effects.
13247.0,Patient,"No, I haven't had any side effects at all and i've not felt mammoth in any type of way and probably close to a month."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
13247.0,Patient,So I feel like it's really helping with that aspect of things.
298.0,Provider,"I don't think it's high enough to help with the depression, yet like we're controlling the mania but we haven't found I have people who need 400 milligrams because their depression is just really in the toilet. And so they need that support. So i'm going to suggest we go again. We go up again. That again it's it's a two week thing we go to what 200 milligrams for two weeks. And that would help tell me about your sleep."
13247.0,Patient,"um my sleep it's not been the best but it's like i've been sleeping the I can't remember what it was the one he prescribed me to help us sleep. And if I tried to half half kind of didn't really do anything so when I. say the whole 50 milligrams I was so groggy the next day he'll probably around 11 in the morning. I tried. I tried taking it like two hours before bedtime I took it an hour before me, I said, maybe i'll try two hours for same thing I was so groggy when I woke up like I almost missed my alarm clock."
298.0,Provider,So I haven't.
13247.0,Patient,"i've only been taking it on the weekends, if I need it because i'm so worried i'll sleep through my alarm."
298.0,Provider,"yeah. i'm sorry i'm sorry you've got to find that magic spot. For it and I think you'll be able to figure it out on the weekends like you've got to get it early enough. And so, not to my head It makes you groggy, on the other side. yeah are you have you been suicidal at all."
13247.0,Patient,"No, not at all."
298.0,Provider,Okay it's her baby I here. yeah oh I love babies. Okay um are you working.
13247.0,Patient,"Yes, I am. What are you doing i'm a nanny so I work Monday through Friday i'm this week i'm actually working all weekend, because the parents are out of town so i'm staying at their house watching goes to their kids but I usually only have the one year old."
298.0,Provider,Very cool do you like your job.
13247.0,Patient,I do yeah.
298.0,Provider,Do you like your life.
13247.0,Patient,"I do, I it's kind of been tough lately because, like me and my son my living with my mom and I just kind of really been feeling like I don't have my own space. But like i'm so thankful for my mom because she really helped me like when I was in a really tough spot she's still helping me, but I just kind of been fill in like. Like i'm almost 35 I still live with my mom i've kind of just been really down on myself, I think, and i'm trying really hard to not be like that, like i'll catch myself being that way. And i'll start redirecting my thoughts to like positive things and this and that, but every now and then i'll just kind of be like oh this sucks and then i'm like no I can't be like that."
298.0,Provider,"So I want you to write down to keep a mood journal, because, as I get to know you, I want to know your cycling. Like the next time that we hit manic you know at or do we stay depressed for months, at a time and we're just trying to pull you up those are things that I am very curious about you."
13247.0,Patient,"know so really. The first time that I can even remember that i've gone this long without feeling manic. And it's almost kind of weird because, like I don't really know what to do with myself so i'm just like i'm so used to cycling almost every other week and now it's been almost a month and i'm just like Oh, this is kind of Nice, but at the same. Time there's more depression, I think, now that i'm like man like every other week."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, because the manic it hides the depression it over hours it. Okay well i'm gonna let you go no any suicidal or homicidal thoughts."
13247.0,Patient,No.
298.0,Provider,matter no all right catch you later.
13247.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
