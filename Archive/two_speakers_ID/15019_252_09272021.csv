252.0,Provider,"Okay perfect Thank you. Okay we're going to complete your bio psychosocial. Okay won't take very long usually after about 1520 minutes. Okay okay. All right, i'm just going to ask you a series of questions about I get a little bit of history from you okay."
15019.0,Patient,Okay sure.
252.0,Provider,"All right, first question is what brings you to bright heart and why now."
15019.0,Patient,"Well, I was i've been seeing as psychiatrist. I suffer from I have. anxiety depression and OCD. i'm on medication for that, and so my psychiatrist he retired and I kind of feel like I do need to see see a therapist because just getting medication and not talking about things I don't think it's very helpful, I feel like I hold a lot in and. there's a lot that I think is kind of. Employment influencing me every day and, like the way I react and how I am and yeah so."
252.0,Provider,"Okay um alright, so the next question wants to know. If you've ever had a alcohol and substance issue."
15019.0,Patient,um I haven't now. The only. I suffered with like eating disorder so i've.
252.0,Provider,yeah and so when was the last time that that has been an issue.
15019.0,Patient,"um I would say, currently become a larva issue."
252.0,Provider,So do you mind if I refer you to our eating disorder Program.
15019.0,Patient,Now that's high. that's okay.
252.0,Provider,"Can you just kind of expand for me just a tad. Are you restricting yourself, or you."
15019.0,Patient,"Usually it's laxatives sometimes. Sometimes i'll wait, you know throw up but usually it's his stick to just laxatives but it's kind of like. As something that, where I try to stop, and then I feel like i'm I need to take it again, you know and. yeah and so yeah and the exercise and things like that. And I guess some some research restrictions, sometimes. But i'm not too bad on that anymore."
252.0,Provider,"And, have you ever been in treatment for it. Okay um do you mind if I refer to in house, as far as that goes. You know, with an eating disorder program that we have."
15019.0,Patient,Sure that's fine yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Alright The next question is. let's see Have you ever experienced any suicidal thoughts or attempts. homicide at that sort of attempts. And what about self harm, such as cutting or burning."
15019.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,and asked her current legal issues.
15019.0,Patient,"um I have gone through a divorce and. I kind of have like I broke up with my ex so there's kind of stuff we have connected, so I kind of think that's going to lead to legal issues in the future, but currently nothing right now so. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Any past or any connection to the military. No okay alright, so the next question is about your family history, so the question kind of wants you to tell me a story like if you were to describe your family growing up your mom and your dad how many siblings do you have what would that really look like."
15019.0,Patient,"I was raised by my grandma my grandpa I was an only child. My dad passed away when I was four months, and my mom when I was a little over a year. i'm not sure my dad's Casa de I was told it was heart attack, but my mom I also was told that my mom was. that she had kidney failure, but when my grandma passed away and I got the death certificate say I found out, it was accidental overdose of prescription medications. So then yeah so kind of the story is starting making sense, you know, and I was my mom in the hospital and what is she missing, you know and it it kind of all made sense so um yeah so I was raised by my grandma and grandpa and. They raised me well and I I took care of my grandma until she passed away so. and make up a passed away so yeah just me."
252.0,Provider,"Thank you, that was a very, very good. Can you do kind of tell me the same story about your education experience."
15019.0,Patient,"yeah sure I went. I mean I graduate from high school I did have a hard time in high school and I didn't like my high school, so I I just kind of stopped going. And I was supposed to do homeschool which I never did, but I ended up going to play another accelerated program and I graduated with honors I went on to college and went to city college and I wasn't really sure what I wanted to major in, and then I ended up going to. cal State University long beach, and I am graduated with my bachelor's and liberal studies, so I went on to teach and now I do have a home daycare preschool. Since i've had that for probably about seven years so. wow yeah. Right now, I have six but i'm getting an assistant, so I can go up to 12 but i'll probably just consult like 11 or something because yeah it's it's a lie, you know, we need more kids to take on so i've kind of yeah I kind of had an issue with my oldest assistant. Like I needed to call the police and they bought and I kind of feel like that. That incident has kind of like impacted me more than i'd like to believe. I almost feel like I have like post traumatic stress or I don't even know if that's possible but it's just. It was just a really stressful incident like something that's never happened before and. So um yeah so that's why i've kind of stayed small as that because i've kind of been trying to work on me and myself and my stress level and. But now I have someone who's going to be in assistance, I can go back to the March and a lot of families need care so hopefully you know it all works out well yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so, and you know even. Even going through what we've gone through with coven. cause a lot of reasons it new ways that we've never experienced before so. I don't know what his story is with your assistant, but I can bet there's kind of traumatic for you."
15019.0,Patient,"It was yeah I feel like for me and. my daughter, I have a 10 year old daughter and luckily she wasn't here when everything happened, but she kind of knows the story and so it's. yeah it's it's I think it's pretty you know traumatic and I think more than i'd like to believe you know I think it's impacted me more."
252.0,Provider,"So that it has, you will see the signs and symptoms, you know. Definitely and and we can talk, you know more about it later on, after. You meet with the person that you're going to meet with for the eating disorder program and see if it's something that you want to engage in. And you know we'll kind of go one step at a time from here."
15019.0,Patient,Okay okay.
252.0,Provider,Any questions for me.
15019.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so."
252.0,Provider,Let me see. What doctor you're working with.
15019.0,Patient,"I can tell you I can look at my emails or is it Okay, if I. Close the camera okay and. Let me go to my email. and let's see. Okay, it looks like i'm working with Francis and make Daniels."
252.0,Provider,That is the physician.
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, and then they have me set set up to do group therapy on Wednesdays. But i'm just. i'm i'm not really sure. As far as group therapy if I don't know if i'm in the right program or what because I don't have like an alcohol or drug issue. I mean I. I suffer with other things, but I was a little confused about if i'm in the right program or. Well, you know. How that works."
252.0,Provider,"Not only well first off it's not always. Just about drugs and alcohol, you know there's anxiety groups depression groups there is other. Okay, besides substance abuse, and you know the therapist in there and. You know the doctor there. Is if it's something I of course i'm going to recommend that you try one time. and see if it's something that you're interested in see if it's something that you can. And if it helps in any way. and try just try."
15019.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. I did it last week I did I did the first meeting. I didn't really talk a lot, because I wasn't really sure what to say and it's kind of it's kind of you know your leader with strangers and it's like how much do you want to tell them and what do you want to tell them, so it was kind of you know, it was it was me getting used to it so. But yeah i'll definitely try it again and see how how I like it."
252.0,Provider,"yeah give it a chance to see because i'll tell you what what I found. Some of these groups is that you bonding connects with people. yeah and you look forward to meeting with this group of people, because you know they understand we're all here for a reason. And it might be different, but it might be the same. frame and to be able to have that connection and have that added support on top of clinical support you know. is going to be important. But I also tell you that if they do your eating disorder assessment."
15019.0,Patient,"Then, your."
252.0,Provider,"Group is probably didn't change. Okay, to an eating disorder specific. OK OK, I think that's probably one of the most important things that we figure out."
15019.0,Patient,"You know yeah. i'm to live yes. Yes, yeah I do and I I try to like. Think it's you know, like personally I try to, and this is probably what a lot of people do is like it's not a big deal, you know the. But I know it is a big deal, and I know it's something that i've been struggling with since I was younger and it's something that just keeps coming back and. So it's something I do need to deal with, especially during covidien to you know, keep myself healthy and you know I can't be doing things to my body that are not healthy so. I definitely think it's important and i've actually had a lot of therapists so focus on my OCD which I don't feel like it's that important. Because it doesn't keep me home, but it does, I mean I do weird stuff like account you know account stuff and account like you know account the. kitchen burners and things like that which you know it's it's, but I feel like yeah I feel like my anxiety is what's. That like causes like the main thing, but I think that's like kind of the trigger for everything and it's just kind of like I feel like that's what I don't have control over is my anxiety and it's just yeah out of hand so."
252.0,Provider,So what I say is that we get you connected with the eating disorder and then you and I can work on your anxiety.
15019.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
252.0,Provider,"it's awful crazy that you say it's anxiety because the last probably six months, you know, since it started anxiety again it's became number one top mental health issue. Right now, and in several of the groups that i'm doing with a different doctor and we are working on anxiety and how to walk through it and how to cope with it and. we're working on this book called anxiety and phobia work book by this author admin born and it has some pretty amazing self awareness things and stuff that you and I can go over. An individual while you're working on. All right. Okay, well, we try it that way, so maybe we can really work on two things at the same time."
15019.0,Patient,"yeah that would be great cuz yeah. I said I know that eating a whole at important, but I also feel like there's so much anxiety and I know I I don't know if it's all connected I don't know but i'm thinking there's probably some connections, there you know so."
252.0,Provider,"we're not going to focus on your OCD if you feel like it's managed manageable. let's you know. yeah let's just work with it there and work within the scope of what we've got and let's work on the two things that you've identified one, I have one you here. Okay Okay, you know is anxiety when I hear is. To be assessed for your eating disorder. Because what I know is that if we don't get better from that piece. it's going to take you, you know."
15019.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,get worse and worse and worse and. Your body's largest town there's a lot of things with that.
15019.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,It will to have support get into a program that helps you with it. will definitely help while you and I are working on getting.
15019.0,Patient,Your anxiety under control yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,sounds like a plan.
15019.0,Patient,yeah sounds like a plan.

15019.0,Patient,"We can any I mean any day. i'm available between 130 and 330 or after 5pm. So. Any day really works for me it's just when, as long as i'm not with the kids."

15019.0,Patient,"A temperate tent at five o'clock okay sorry i'm checking my. Calendar yes October 10. And five o'clock guess, we can do that okay."
