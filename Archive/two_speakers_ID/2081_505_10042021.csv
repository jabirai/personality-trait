505.0,Provider,"Like okay. But it's time. it's time to go to two and a half a day, at least for now. Okay, and to keep you safe. Because remember this medicine is that we're all black, so you don't start going real fast and you're keeping it together and you've got a lot you've got some great clean time but let's respect this disease enough that if you're a heavy in cravings we got to get after it."
2081.0,Patient,yeah I in my own notice first get up in the morning and all feel like that i'm getting cold chills I can get sick and i'm like I know I cannot be sick it's got to be in long line or something but i'll feel like that you know it can be in my head is everything.
505.0,Provider,"It doesn't matter listen remember that your medication helps with mood and pain, as well as craving, so I think it's going to help you on many levels, but I want to talk about depression as well, are you feeling depressed you sound depressed."
2081.0,Patient,"Sometimes i'll get. Things in my head that. can be leaning toward that a little bit i've never been type of person i've always sort of lean toward to stop trying to find the happy out of any things that are bad, but some of my thoughts i've noticed are leaning toward bike. Oh, never used to go anywhere Jeff don't really love me or no kids are driving me insane or something like because kirkland's right that age where she where she is like driving me insane."
505.0,Provider,yeah.
2081.0,Patient,yeah. She cried all day yesterday all day like this small you know just squally around crying all day long I lose it.
505.0,Provider,"So yeah I know I could I could get it so you've had two girls back to back like these pregnant disease for so close. That i'm wondering if you didn't have some postpartum depression after kirkland go straight into feeling sick and being pregnant, then I have Barbara and now you are having some postpartum depression."
2081.0,Patient,"And I think it well, I kind of know I did was kirpan buddy it turned into like because they tried to take her because I do something stupid and. They because I was feeling really bad I was pregnant, the first time I didn't know how to handle how I felt. So I did something really stupid and it caused a lot of trouble, and they try and take her and I got her back you know real quick, but it was right after she was born, so it threw me into like a frenzy."
505.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
2081.0,Patient,"My my my mind, you know so yeah yeah and then she had cradle CAP, but she had a horrible all over and they were blaming me, you know say I don't even know what cradle CAP is you know it's. Rare because I don't know what they're talking about and. Like she woke up and she her eyes were mad at me because it cradle CAP, but I was freaking. out and wow. Like some my family members will take something out of hand and take it to the extremes and want to run to the doctor for everything and act like it's a big deal. yeah yeah any causes it causes trouble because."
505.0,Provider,"So so let's. So, given kind of what was going on with kirkland out super stressful now you're in this situation i'll be honest with you there, I think we should try and antidepressants. and the one that. I recommend is all off and it's it's not a benzo it's not addictive there's nothing bad that to put your rats. The issue you might sometimes when you get treated for Depression and anxiety you don't know how bad it was and how hard you were working until you feel better you know what I mean."
2081.0,Patient,"yeah and I get other things well i'm like i'm i'm starting school, oh no, I think I told you guys out in class."
