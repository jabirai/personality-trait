14162.0,Patient,Hello.
408.0,Provider,"hello, how are you."
14162.0,Patient,just fine.
408.0,Provider,"Well, good i'm glad we could have our session today, following up on our group session. So at our group session um you were saying your level of arousal. Right. yeah right was being monitored you monitor that day I know we talked at your last session that you were very down very low on mood and arousal level. Right. yeah related to you, your father's needs and feeling overwhelmed by other people's demands."
14162.0,Patient,"Right, I have, and then I realized, after some things happen, I think it was either Sunday Sunday, not because I went down there over the weekend and then suddenly I. came back home and I realized, you know, even though that he's gone through what he's gone through and i'm going through what i've gone through you know i'm gonna let that go because it made me cry almost every day. yeah the preparation and everything and worry and stuff I can't worry about things I can't control in a war, you know."
408.0,Provider,Okay.
14162.0,Patient,"I don't worry. Okay. yeah I got to worry about my. tail he's getting older and I know that you know, he said before, I was 74 years old. And like he said he said, you know, after a while so i'm just worried about you, I don't want that to happen to you, you know we're real close dad. You know, but if you're the ones controlling it and I keep on trying to tell you what you should do and. And what is right everything and then you could go behind me and did the deal for opposite when everybody's trying to give you advice and stuff but you got to do what you're going to do so, I got well as I got do what I gotta do."
408.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14162.0,Patient,You know I can't worry about everybody else you know I got to worry about my sales if I don't give myself happy i'm worried up having a stroke or heart attack was sale.
408.0,Provider,"Well, good and that's certainly appropriate self talk. To get yourself in a more realistic place emotionally. yeah um so that you can still focus on your own recovery and your own health, of course, part of the issue you know, is a gender based issue is that, as women, we are kind of socialized and raised to take care of our family."
14162.0,Patient,yeah ideas.
408.0,Provider,"And somewhere in our socialization and the way we were raised and. The way we all the messages from society that we have processed, we tend to think that that's supposed to come first, or what gives us value. Which is okay, up to a point, unless you are at a place in your life, where you really have to work on your health first in order to have enough energy and bandwidth to be available to help other people. yeah, which is another way of saying what you just said Denise."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah it is, it is, I know that."
408.0,Provider,"The issue is how do you feel about that, because sometimes you can realize that in your head, but in your heart, it still makes you feel bad."
14162.0,Patient,"Well ya know that well like I said there for two days i'd be trying to get out of me with a it's me text me a call the place and everything to them do a welfare checks go check on it instead. And they did and stuff and they would tell me what was going on, and then I call you back and everything So if you don't answer me in the circumstances you orient. I worry about you, you know your own or anything could happen to you can you know that stroke out or they might come over and just beat you up and kill, you and I never know we're so far away from each other we're two and a half hours away I can't get there fast enough. Right, you know, and then I realized two or three days went by and it was the same thing again. And then I was like that i'm tired of you, stressing me out cause me to worry about you, having a headache. So my head hurts so bad that I had to go to bed there couple minutes just my head take a shower get my head and that's it. it's not a headache it's stress, you know that was causing that you know, and I said before, if you remember, five years ago I said I was, I had a stroke overstressed and had a blood clot obi wan celebrated on the backs that I can't I can't do this again."
408.0,Provider,So that's. that's really serious and did he did he acknowledged that.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah he did he did he he I understand you know he, like he said. i've been with this person for so long, and I know where you're coming from and i'm happier now today's. i'm just trying to keep the peace and quiet and I said, sometimes you got to get the place in Bob dad you got to take restraining orders I don't people. To keep them away don't talk to him don't take some don't communicate just distance yourself. You know move up here where i'm at close that house down to come up here live in your House, you know work site fact. You know, and I say they make excuses why they need to do this dad you make money you draw checks, you also security with your retirement your va you don't need to go out there Mike H to money and everything you don't need all that you know. that's it all you're doing is just cause more problems and it's causing me to be stressed out because you asked me for help. And I said I can't help you if you don't sit there and try to listen to me, you know at least take some kind of consideration how I feel and how you know my sister feels and stuff there's other people involved, you know and that's you just gotta listen sometimes."
408.0,Provider,Go ahead.
14162.0,Patient,"He said this weekend, he called me while ago, and he wanted me to come down today, and so my group, I had a therapy meeting today and I said i'll come down tomorrow and he's the welcoming you just Saturday. And you can spend a couple days with me and help me get some of these paperwork together. And I said well we're not gonna go down there to there the House, we will stay appear what were your that away I won't be stressed out and you're in peaceful and quiet because I can't handle it down there. As he just calls me aggravation and acid it'll end up getting somebody hurt real bad. So he agreed to it, but that term if he decided i'll certainly wants to go back to the House where there's problems that and I believe, and I said i'll just have to wait to you get your divorce final and just walk away until you're ready."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so you really set a boundary."
14162.0,Patient,yeah I have you thought about that since then we've been having for.
408.0,Provider,thoughts about it or feeling guilty or shameful shame or anything negative emotions.
14162.0,Patient,"No, I haven't so far I haven't so far, you know what I hope cuz like I said I was feeling bad air couple days and stuff and I said i'm I came to us hey like you know, and I know it was a stress headache. yeah and I just said, I can't I felt bad I slept I most of the day, all the time trying to sleep I just I can't do it, you know. So, yesterday I kind of got up and everything we got my code which shards Devon everything and I started, and this morning I got up and then some stuff I had to do at the D amp D and it's a security office. So I said, well, hopefully, you know i'm back on track and get myself together and and we realized he's a grown man he's going to do what he's got to do, and if you don't want to listen to me, and he knows he's on his own you know."
408.0,Provider,"And, of course, one little side note here is, since you just got your coven vaccination. it's important that you haven't been feeling well, especially emotionally to be prepared that you probably going to have some physical symptoms, so you may feel a little fatigued or a little sore and that's perfectly normal."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah my arm is killing me, so I say no, and I woke up. One news this morning I don't know I got a runny nose runny nose this part of it."
408.0,Provider,You may have a runny nose that's part of the side effects.
14162.0,Patient,yeah you may. Talk it out of my nose.
408.0,Provider,"yeah and that can be part of the side effects of the vaccination, you can even you know notice that. You know, some other things of like bruises you be Ruby bruising easily the next few days don't even worry about it. um if you still have menstrual cycle, you may have a little heavier on your menstrual cycle if you're having one in the next couple of days. don't worry about it it's just part of the side effects of the vaccine and, of course, if you actually had a case of code, it would be that many times greater right many times worse. But since you've been on the depressed side, I just want to prepare you so that. You can take that into account and not be overly worried about it. Right you don't need to be like I say stressed and you're saying you don't need to be stressed, or worried about anything that's not absolutely necessary to do something about. The only thing you can maybe think about doing is do the comfort measures that are recommended, such as comfortable as possible, as far as the code vaccination so put an ice Pack on the injection site. helps a lot. It helps a lot."
14162.0,Patient,"So I was wondering, I thought about that last night."
408.0,Provider,"literally just like any just like any vaccination you ever had in your life. Putting Kolpak on it will help a lot also anything to reduce inflammation like whatever you would do for a fever, whether it's tylenol ibuprofen aspirin whatever you do I wouldn't suggest aspirin actually. Because of the bleeding issue but tylenol or ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation the soreness or if you get a mild fever or take care of that, but that was ice will really take care of the soreness a lot. yeah and then the other day."
14162.0,Patient,I delete my Armor.
408.0,Provider,"Well, it will but here's this here's the tip that's really surprising is, the more you use that arm, the sooner the soreness goes away. Okay that's true with any vaccination. Because what we do is oh it hurts i'm going to keep it as still as possible well that actually makes it more inflamed longer. If we do some exercise it helps our natural body processes for dealing with inflammation to kick in over time, so that it will take a while a lot of those inflammatory. natural part of inflammation in the body. Okay right, so I fought tylenol ibuprofen and don't be afraid to use the arm now, you need to rest if you're fatigued you should rest. Just take it easy put your feet up don't try I know you're screwing around doing errands but the day after your coven vaccination is probably not the best day to run around a lot. yeah just yeah."
14162.0,Patient,"that's why a lot of people say just go relax and watch maybe I said there's a couple of movies, I want to watch on netflix today. But I hot tub and step, I said i'ma lay in the hot tub and watch couple movies, you."
408.0,Provider,don't as long as you don't expose the injection site to the water.
14162.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,Because you don't know. Right. Just don't yeah they treat don't get that party arm black.
14162.0,Patient,Okay yeah but it's got.
408.0,Provider,Its got chemicals.
14162.0,Patient,"it's got cold I don't even know if I want to get in there because it's so. warm and we got a big cold light coming in, here it was like 78 degrees yesterday today it's 60."
408.0,Provider,"So yeah it's it's here too it's a cold snap here too, so but it's fine to do that if it relaxes you just. You know, because of the chemicals in the hot tub just don't get the water on your arm, I mean you can take a shower or whatever, but it's just the chemicals in the hot tub. yeah The other thing that might be a guarantee, if you watch the movie and I know that seems counterintuitive or surprising. But you know those soup cans we weights, we talked about his hand weights on Wednesday get a couple of soup cans and go ahead and do some bicep curls with both arms, including the one that had the injection that sore. Okay, it will get rid of the soreness faster if you exercise it. yeah move it around."
14162.0,Patient,"When I was been doing a few a little bit of laundry I carried the I said I felt like when I lifted up with a bad hey I said it kind of felt kind of good leads to carry that the stairs I said oh my God, but when it got to the top of the stairs I was like oh God my arm."
408.0,Provider,"You know, but i'm not sure lifting and care i'm not sure lifting and carrying a big load, but maybe while you're sitting down. While you're sitting watching a movie just get one of those regular sized soup cans, which are not as heavy as laundry usually. A regular sized suit can do you have one. With yeah can you go get one."
14162.0,Patient,i'll show you want me to do i'll show you a couple things to do with it.
408.0,Provider,"Yet, to have them if you got to."
14162.0,Patient,"Ladies, can you see him late, let me go."
408.0,Provider,"back you might see a baby, just like regular size Campbell Soups."
14162.0,Patient,lay hold of.
408.0,Provider,Like 14 ounces not the big ones. You say yeah that's fine that's fine. You got a couple of those.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah I got to among us wait hold on, let me sit that came right back see it both Evan. Can you say."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, good so Can you see my arms, let me stand up. Can you see my arms."
14162.0,Patient,yeah I can see your arms.
408.0,Provider,"All right, so you're going to put your arms down by your side, holding on to the soup cans. Okay you're going to raise them up to your shoulders and back down it's called a bicep curl."
14162.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,yeah i've been down five times. slowly. And then you're going to bring your arms up here above just above your shoulders and you're going to lift the soup cans up now that's going to be more sore lift it up. I know I know. You can. and bring it down bring the soup cans dad.
14162.0,Patient,Oh good.
408.0,Provider,To be that's going to be more sewer.
14162.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
408.0,Provider,lifted up as much as you can and then down.
14162.0,Patient,Oh God its own so.
408.0,Provider,"Slowly slowly keep breathing don't hold your breath keep breathing because you want to send the oxygen into those our muscles. The oxygen and the red blood cells will help take away some of the inflammation that's making a sore okay good. and bring it bring it back. All right now, you can."
14162.0,Patient,Choose or. What it hurts to be in the order.
408.0,Provider,that's right.
14162.0,Patient,Oh God oh.
408.0,Provider,"damn come back down don't you don't have to leave it up very long now, you can go back to your bicep curls that are a little more comfortable for you."
14162.0,Patient,Oh yeah oh God that was the best.
408.0,Provider,"Advice up just the bicep curls. All right, good so you can just do the bicep curls then if it's so uncomfortable to live."
14162.0,Patient,off of.
408.0,Provider,"Just do the bicep curls. yeah right, but any can you can also I don't know if it's painful to just. bring your arms out to the side. Can you lift it up a little bit about. How does that feel."
14162.0,Patient,Oh it's like.
408.0,Provider,"Oh, I hear her tell you to. Do it then straighten up the arm straighten out the arm don't bend the elbow. How does that feel and I bring them down. Dan there you go."
14162.0,Patient,That feels better than lift him.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so you could try that, with or without the soup cans, but the soup cans down and try just lifting your arms up to the side."
14162.0,Patient,Oh yeah oh you.
408.0,Provider,don't have to live up to high don't lifted high above your shoulder. Just lift it to the point of not too much discomfort.
14162.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
408.0,Provider,And down and down.
14162.0,Patient,"All right, moving the mouse, you can feel it moving it straight to the muscle."
408.0,Provider,"And down right all right, and you can stop now, and just when you're watching the movie maybe do a few of those, as you can tolerate them. You don't have to be in great pain, you should not be in great pain, but just a little bit a little sore just keep your range of motion limited to the point where it's not really painful but it's just a little bit so don't push it too far."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah you know how you get a charley horse in the backyard late cramping stuff. that's what it kind of felt like when I was lifting that pie, like, I had a like a crepe my arm that kit normally be in."
408.0,Provider,"yeah don't lift it that high them today, it is probably going to be better tomorrow. Right, so you can do the exercises more comfortably tomorrow, but I would still do some of them today. Again, because the more you hold that arm still the longer it takes the information to subside."
14162.0,Patient,"So co packed are better than more impacts, the latest."
408.0,Provider,"At this point, because you had the vaccination yesterday, right. yeah. So at this point cool patch usually are more effective, but you can try either one what see what works, but yeah most people feel that the Kolpak is more effective, the day after."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah cuz see my I feel my or what now, and when I feel it feels like it's real hard there."
408.0,Provider,Oh sure yeah yeah exactly. And so don't don't push on it. But that's because it's swollen from the inflammation.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah because I hate needles and then, when they stuck me yesterday. where he had to take a picture and he said beliefs and Dr you get a sticker if she sees that needle she's gonna fall on the floor on you. Because I get scared of needles about completely in the flu I don't know what it is, but if I see a needle I just fall out I don't know what it is."
408.0,Provider,"it's a vasovagal response it's called a vasovagal response, and some people are born with it and it tends to be triggered by the sight of blood or even being in a hospital room or a hypodermic needle yeah vasovagal response your blood pressure, goes down and you pass out."
14162.0,Patient,Every time they every time I had to do blood work that's what happens to me.
408.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so it's just something you're born with it's not really dangerous except you if you know you have it, you can prepare for the appointment right, you can prepare by squeezing your buttocks together and your thighs together. And that will raise your blood pressure, just a tiny bit. To counteract the vasovagal effect."
14162.0,Patient,Oh yeah my dad has it because he can go in the hospital he goes in the hospital he smell he gets to me and gets sick and starts ready to pass out.
408.0,Provider,And you know that's a very disabling symptom because we all. have to get health care.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I try my sound know how you do it, he said, I can go to the doctor's office beginning to the hospital the Nice I can't do it."
408.0,Provider,"Well, there may be some anxiety there to them yeah which is separate from the physiological a vasovagal response."
14162.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
408.0,Provider,But next time you can try that is right before. Right when you're there and you're about to have the exposure to blood or needles just just tighten your gluteus muscles a little bit and your thigh muscles and it just raises the pressure just a tiny bit to counteract that sudden decreasing blood pressure.
14162.0,Patient,"Okay, and they were new and nobody told me. Every time I get ready to do blood they always get the rag behind my head and put one on my forehead and tell me the lean back and they start talking to me. yeah you know well, they don't know you."
408.0,Provider,don't know you have a vasovagal. They say.
14162.0,Patient,Real sale yeah they say your turn and pale in the face sentence and what's wrong with.
408.0,Provider,"That individual vago response because your blood pressure is going down and that and your blood vessels. are tightening up. which makes you pale right because you don't have as many red blood cells coming to those those blood vessels in your face. Oh, that makes sense yeah. So you're not just like when you exercise your cheeks get pinker. yeah that's because there's more efficient blood flow to the heart and the upper body when you're exercising and ultimately to all the parts of the body. So it's bringing more oxygen and more red blood cells, because your blood vessels that are dilating they're getting bigger to allow more blood to flow, so you get pinker less pale."
14162.0,Patient,yeah it's true.
408.0,Provider,yeah because i've been while instead we've been walking in.
14162.0,Patient,The park.
408.0,Provider,"because that was the other thing that I had mentioned to you in in group, and I wanted to mention it again is that, for your depressive symptoms, which we're getting pretty worrisome there at our last session last week. exercise is a very good thing to do."
14162.0,Patient,yeah yeah because it made me feel better being outside and everything and stuff I like being outside and stuff.
408.0,Provider,"So i'm outside is outside great, but even if you have to do it indoors. You some weightlifting do some barbies do some mountain climbers do some jumping Jacks gets get your blood flowing and that changes the brain chemistry away from the direction of depression."
14162.0,Patient,yeah because we we've been doing that downstairs in the basement everything with the big screen will be going down there and stuff and doing jumping Jacks and everything.
408.0,Provider,"Oh, you have excellent so when when did you do that last yesterday."
14162.0,Patient,"started that we we started doing that way, he was. Late Friday morning I did a Friday morning Saturday, then I left and I didn't come back to learn day and we did a couple Tuesday morning."
408.0,Provider,Excellent.
14162.0,Patient,"So we don't apply three days and we stayed in the other two we skipped because we had to the one of the things so we thought about three yeah three four days and yesterday, we did some after we have a group so."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, good for you."
14162.0,Patient,"on a Monday and four days, four days, and then we skip today's."
408.0,Provider,"And then you did, and you did notice after a period of exercise that your mood improved."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I was ready to go jump in the shower and Eric thing and then you want to go anywhere do anything. And we just decided to go out into your base with the flowers, because everything was you know clean up the garden and step, and then we just take out welcome to the park, you know, he said, you won't walk to the store and I was like no I don't want to go up at be keel right now."
408.0,Provider,"Well, you are so lucky to have a park nearby."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah we live in the city limits, so you can go about everywhere, you know we're right here in the city."
408.0,Provider,Okay okay well. Honest on a belief belief system of zero to 100% how much do you believe Denise that you can do three more days of including exercise between now and next week. Putting the weekend. So.
14162.0,Patient,"How many days, do you think I can do it till next week i'll probably can do at least. I like to do it every day, I would like to do it every day."
408.0,Provider,But I would be great now.
14162.0,Patient,"If I had to skip one day, you know because that's why i'm i'm traveling back to my dads and staff. which were employees going to charleston I mean Huntington so that's only 30 minutes. And I was still taking it's still taking time away from your self care. And yeah. So he said he would be here, probably about one o'clock I can do about early that morning, and he said it'll be here at one and he wants us to cook a big dinner, so I don't know why we're going to cook a big dinner, but my sister's Cameron, and her little boy. me and rage, you will have him grains and cabbage and steps oh."

408.0,Provider,yeah reggie to do it yeah so.
14162.0,Patient,"So excuse. No, I probably will probably we already know yeah i'll be playing out wash the dishes because you know, like cleaning up I said you cook this and i'll do the dishes."
408.0,Provider,You know that's that's good because cooking is his happy place.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah where'd you loves to cook so yeah so i'll probably do that and everything I said yeah I said well do something like get. And I say will have us a nice little dinner and stuff because we've been cooking like every weekend he'll guys, because to fix that and we'd be doing spaghetti chicken Alfredo support jobs chicken but we've been putting a limit pants because he wants to take some home with him. and kick the later on, it not not time freeze it and then you could put it back in the EVO and you're ready to eat."
408.0,Provider,"Well, see and hear you been feeling all bad about not being able to help your father and you've been doing all this cooking for him that he'd been. There are. Even sharing I mean you've been shipped him, it could you for it but you've been sharing with them that's great."
14162.0,Patient,"Right I just well like I said I worry about you sometimes instead of mediums the closest one compared to everybody else you know, last Easter might come around every once in three months if that you know that me and that's tough, we talked at least three or four times a day, if not well. So yeah."
408.0,Provider,"So, in terms of his being it sounds like he's really hung up with this relationship."
14162.0,Patient,"they've been together for 15 years and I noticed a difference from when when when my mom was married to compared to the end when this woman. I think when he was young, with my mom they both cheated on each other and this moment I noticed he never cheated on her he was good to her gave her everything in the world and that's how you that's what sport or you know you gave her everything you know. and yeah and I said no credit card was no limit to her and acid, and then, when she robbed Jeff and stoke $50,000 out of your personal bank account, and your credit limit. Then you realize Oh, she wanted us for a minute money she wasn't a good player cook for me to have to clean the House when he came home from work. You know, he had to do everything, and so I just think that you know, and he he said he's just don't know if you want to be alone us and you're not going to be alone that you know you're not gonna be alone, so I think."
408.0,Provider,And sometimes their worst being with the wrong person is sometimes worse than being alone.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah and I could tell you what he said and he says, now, he said, I came home to a clean house, I feel like i'm staying in a hotel. I get food i'm not arguing every day, you know I feel happy, so do you want to go back to that lab where you was stressed out in the hospital all the time. You know, worried all the time, how do you feel he's i'm happier, he said, our worries about because he has another set of kids you know with her and like I totally only been with you right now so don't worry about it, you know they want to be with you. Know hopefully he'll was that."
408.0,Provider,"It sounds like his his main the main stumbling block he's experiencing is. Just accepting the loss of the relationship. yeah maybe he could get some counseling through the va that would be helpful for that, what do you think."
14162.0,Patient,"I do too I that's what I told him because I know a couple of girls that work at the va that he goes to instead I told him just out to him and stuff you know, a couple girls couple of the nurses said that when he comes in, next time, no talk to me, you know. And i've had no but."
408.0,Provider,"He could also benefit from a couple of formal therapy sessions, just to to kind of. grieve this loss, but also not. overthinking or paint it and rose see it with rose colored glasses."
14162.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"You know, like you're saying he he's not able to see the downside and he's having of the relationship and he's having trouble accepting letting it down."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah because, like, I told him I said she's already got a new but she's got a new may leave them with her in a trailer that you let her leave him that that you sit there in your yard. You know she's got to meet over there, you know you need to tell her to get out of that trailer move out, you know she's got to go you're setting up paying all the bills by her new boyfriend sleeping in there. You know I said you got to say no, sometimes you gotta pitch fit out and always says as well you know she's the moment my kids i'm responsible, I told him all right take care of the rest of the lap."
408.0,Provider,"You know why I like hearing she's over there, pulling guns out on you can ever best and up your House."
14162.0,Patient,"flat your tires everything she's doing all this bad stuff to you don't you see that she don't care about you. You know and i'll she does to keep them coming over and asking, can you buy me a phone, can you buy me a house, can you buy me this you know you gave her everything she's the one didn't want know the stuff she left you. You know you sometimes you just gotta let go dad he goes it's hard when you love somebody I said I know that when they're destroying you."
408.0,Provider,"say I really I really would suggest to you that he may be able to hear some of those messages more objectively, coming from a counselor a professional counselor then from his daughter."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah other. Because the some of the kids like the youngest kid he has a six years old, and he always used to stay with us, and when I stay down there last weekend. And my son came into and his girlfriend unless let's call it call me mom and he said, why did why didn't call you mama So that is my son he goes well, I thought, all of y'all was paul's kids and I thought you was his sister. I said, all these title and you're you're seven years old and you thought that I was his history gets yeah my mom never told me to do, I said no i'm really your half sister i'm kingdom your half sister You know, as I know, it's hard to put your morale does that what does it. Say Vanessa do, but I am so now that's my key that's not bright and that's not my dad's key that's my kid. So it was it's kind of weird situation, but you know I said it's maybe it is maybe does they hear it from somebody else instead of everybody in the family, trying to explain it to me, you know. Maybe he didn't you know, and these lawyers been talking to him so yesterday he had a meeting with these lawyer so i'm hopefully he's allowed to talk some steam it until he."
408.0,Provider,was not really his lawyers job. or wrong really isn't right. The goal.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah the law you're called means I just told your dad that he needs to go to get everything and he just needs to pick that woman in jail and he don't want to put her in jail, I say."
408.0,Provider,"yeah I mean and that's the lawyers role, but as far as actually sorting through all these mixed feelings, he has after 15 years. um you know there's counselors have training to help people do that. So."
14162.0,Patient,"You know i'm gonna sound will meet it to me squeaky and SAP would be willing to go to therapy as that but i'm gonna tell him, you know it's through your va you can get it for you, they like."
408.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly right. yeah right if he says he's a veteran he can get it through the va and he should feel somewhat comfortable, since it will be in like a doctor's office, not a hospital."
14162.0,Patient,"Right yeah cuz he goes to the doctor's Office here in a to where I live, but it's only two minutes from here."
408.0,Provider,"Good good, well, maybe, if you really talk to them about doing that because you know family members who aren't trained counselors can talk sense but that's not necessarily what's going to change sorting through all the all the feelings. yeah the most high you know cuz it might make sense up here. yeah but not."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah the heart right, I know."
408.0,Provider,I just like we were talking about your you yourself.
14162.0,Patient,"is true yeah that's what I told him because, like my son did some bad stuff down there that when I stayed on that and stuff and I told him that so. When you say to him, I said I gotta tell brain and tough love again so then we'll go talia. And let him know how I feel about it same thing to buy his mom I said, but sometimes I have to like write a note it's tough love again i'm worried you're going down the wrong path again. You know, and I can't be around you while you're going down that path you know I can't do it. You know, so I think he got the message, he said mom caught he caught my dad and mom called me and told me. That i've been getting tough love again and I went going down the wrong path is Brian and you are, you are so messed up and I hear that you pass that on the porch in front of everybody and act like. That and when your mom searched your bag she found all the dope in your bag. And she said in your mom was very upset he said no, and your mom is doing right and doing good and then here you was doing good for a year and then you relapse them going down that road again. And some stuff got stolen and Eric done, you know, and you know why the world, and you know again got stolen and. dad said, Brian your mom's been here for almost seven weeks now, why is that good not got miss until the UK, you know so they invited don't want to meet to Internet and he won't say yes, he did it or no he didn't he just hangs up on us. Knowing that we don't get it. You know, we all know, so that's the bad thing he's gone down that road, and like I told that it won't be a surprise if his probation officer no surprise, he won't be as it, you know. So that's what I did."
408.0,Provider,Maybe maybe that's what it'll take.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah well that's what happened last time I had to call his probation officer and just surprise drug test and they put him in rehab so I might have to do another call again and do another we have. Because I fairly couple needles in his bag, with his dope so I knew it was going down the wrong path, I said I rather see him I know it's my child, but I read the same lock that in back on the streets and doing open in and having a relapse and died, you know. And I know it's helpful to say but that's how I love him, you know rather see locked up or be aware, you have the insight on yo D and."
408.0,Provider,I don't see that as being awful.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah some people say you shouldn't call it la he'll figure it out and i'm like no I rather sad, you know. that's that's probably people he's free insight and you know people he's free insane his girlfriend saying that you know. I said they're probably all doing the same thing you know because they say this leave him alone Denise you know and i'm like no I rather been jail and where you have are some instead of finding dead, no, no. Because if you'd be claimed that well and then go back doing needles and step which I don't know about Natal step I don't know about people that showed up dope I mean I snorted it. But I think that would it hurt you more if you're shooting it up and your vein, that it will be more snoring and I don't I don't know what's the difference, but i'd rather find brain and you know in rehab Center shooting dope but noted keeling you might get the wrong stuff you know. So I said don't be surprised, I said to myself don't be surprised I might call that guy to do what you gotta do you got it last time, and I said yeah and Brian thanks for to he knows it's tough love, but he'll take me that long word."
408.0,Provider,Why that's you've had a tough tough series of events here. yeah maybe I guess.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah begging to do this, read this time the spiritual wisdom thing I begged him to do that. I told that's what me a word he's done it helps us that if you don't want to leave your place did that boring and that's and you can talk to him every week. You can do everything so, then you just go to get your prescription, you can see the doctor and see the therapist I said they'll do urine test on everything. You know, and he said I don't know man I just don't know if I can go 10 hours without being sick I said why don't you just got to get over that 10 hours you know I said, if you want to will help you and everything I said."
408.0,Provider,"Well, let me also could go into a hospital based detox unit, you could go into a hospital based each application unit."
14162.0,Patient,"We are not talking my son my daughter gave me step or stomach problems nausea crepes I said he wasn't bad this time really coming off like it was before, and you lay there seeking that film, but it wasn't that bad. As they don't give you so to go through the withdrawals without feeling sick like that and that busted."
408.0,Provider,that's why we call it medication assisted treatment.
14162.0,Patient,"yeah so they'll help you in every day as it's not like how places you'd been before and stuff so this this place will help you. You know, when I said try it out and then he promised me he would go Monday to as a box and cleaning, but he didn't go Monday. And then Tuesday we got into because the game was missing and I called him and asked him why did he still to get and he hung up on me and then I said well you know I had to let him if nothing's done if you don't go, but more towards product Monday i'm calling his probation officer. So it'll be on any of the cuz he's got a baby coming in December."
408.0,Provider,"Oh, my."

408.0,Provider,"says, therefore, see yes, is there for the safety of the child."
14162.0,Patient,"And like I told Brian and y'all should know better, because she has three other kids in our other three kids are with our parents. yeah looking for long row, but like I told we're not gonna like make sure myself is healthy and fit That way, you know i've got another son it's doing good and everything and least you know I know he'll be our at the brain and he just would break me down. So."
408.0,Provider,let's do a double check on your depression symptoms okay before we we wind up things because I know we've been talking about some really heavy burdens.
14162.0,Patient,That you're worried about so.

14162.0,Patient,"A now labia I might be skipping one meal now I was doing like three meals, a day i've been skipping one meal, but dollar ways not did, that is because the other day, is in the picture of myself. When I saw that picture of myself, I was like oh my God gained a lot of weight that's."
408.0,Provider,Really so have you actually weighed yourself to see if you really have gained weight.
14162.0,Patient,"No, but i'll tell you this um I don't weigh myself I don't want to, but I noticed, like the clothes, that I was wearing when oh so I know they got top because now, I have to lay a button."
408.0,Provider,"that's a good way that's a good way to challenge this when your clothes get a little tight and uncomfortable that's a very good way to tell yeah. yeah so you know that as long as you're eating healthy options, the other meals, you know that's, the main thing because you really have to. Follow overall good health habits, for your recovery from substance use. Well i'm saying it's. What you eat it's your sleep. it's your exercise it's your. Lower stress lowering your stress it's all of that to prevent a relapse."
14162.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's what i'm saying, because, like I said when I cried there for a day or two and everything it was slip like I did in us no no. I can't let everybody down a spiral get me down and have me misstep of a mess up my laugh again when I finally got my left going back on track, I can go through that again I there's no way I can go through that again."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, it is i've worked really hard you worked. really hard to get here so. What about sleep, how many days have you had any either slept too much or not able to sleep. I can't hear you. I can't either I don't. know, can you hear me I hear you."
14162.0,Patient,"Okay, I think it was just that, one day, when I got all stressed out crying and had that bad headache and everything. And the laughter and all that and said, I am not work put myself through that you know getting upset and crying like in my head hurt. Trying to express how I feel if you're not going to leave something you know I can't do nothing about it, but just give you my opinion, if you don't want to, then I got to do things for myself."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so out of the last six or seven nights how much sleep, have you been able good sleep, have you been able to achieve."
14162.0,Patient,"Oh, probably good similar eight hours we've been going to be in here the last couple about 1130 and we slept to about 32."

14162.0,Patient,"Last night I went to bed about one o'clock last night, but I got up at 430 and then we back to bed, but I got up at 730, but I think it was my one was hard, because every time I twisted around my own was sore you know. Okay, Brian Rachel came closer to me and i'd say you might want my arm. My arm just felt so bad last night. So I think it was mostly the shot."
408.0,Provider,"yeah so before bed tonight, if you if you're open to it, maybe take some tylenol or ibuprofen right when you go to bed or an hour before him, so it will reduce the soreness of the inflammation so you can sleep better."
