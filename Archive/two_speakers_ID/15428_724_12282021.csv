15428.0,Patient,"Not much, not much. hang on, let me go I gotta work real quick. Christmas."

15428.0,Patient,very nice very nice.
724.0,Provider,yeah you.
15428.0,Patient,"Soon super uneventful watch some football, it was in bed early i'm still struggling with my. My schedule, but i'm working on that i'm. hanging out. Yes or no, no. To start like my routine my schedule. This, like the last couple mornings i've been getting up before my dog. And I know part of its because i've been going to bed early again like yesterday was just a super lazy and I spent most of the day in bed, not out of depression or anything it's just felt like a lazy day. So, but this morning I was like wide awake at three o'clock in the morning and I tried going back sleep was tossing and turning and it's going to give it slips I just got up. And that's been kind of the last couple mornings, and I know it's going to take time to get me back on track, but i'm just struggling again to I guess stay up to a reasonable hour to work and get up at also a reasonable hour."
724.0,Provider,Well what's your what are your NAPs like you still napping.
15428.0,Patient,"No i've. got down on those sites, yesterday I think yesterday with was my only nap within that week that week period."
724.0,Provider,"Well, you don't have to cut them completely out we. just talked about cutting the."
15428.0,Patient,"boy now. I go to the extreme. Extreme I don't I can't help it, but I just figured I needed like be super tired and I that's my goal is to be tired at a reasonable hour not like exhausted at seven, but you know tired, where I want to go to bed like nine or 10 or something like that, like our normal person. But i'm working on it other than that it was good good Christmas just an eventful hanging out. food. slept us watch football yeah."
724.0,Provider,"it's always better that way, I feel like there's. holidays agree festival, as it is so. When things kind of go pretty uneventful. Like everybody else's horror stories you're like okay i'll."
15428.0,Patient,"Definitely know my experience exactly and and something that you said a couple weeks ago I was like. that's still kind of raw that my dad's not here for the holidays still since he passed last year, and you had said well now it's time to forge a new tradition so. that's kind of what I took the mindset of this this past Christmas just to start something new, I mean we had hamburgers for dinner we didn't do anything super fancy which become orders and it was great. So yeah to start something new and i'm following the past that's not gonna get me anywhere. chalkboard."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's good to to start new traditions, you know what I mean, and you can also. You can also like kind of like a pick up something that like so your dad used to do that was kind of unique to like that, like the holiday experience is to pick that up and kind of like tweak it and make it your own, but still have like the the baseline. Be song that he might have did a lot of times we'll just look oh that's what my dad used to do, and my grandmother used to do that, so I don't I don't pick holiday cookies anymore, because that's what they do and it's like what you don't like holiday cookies anymore what."
15428.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You should still do that and then you're like you know eventually you'd be like I, this is something like my mom used to do so. it's a good traditional like pass on because that's probably where a lot of their traditions, come from too so it's important to kind of hold on to some of those things, even at the base level."
15428.0,Patient,"And a lot of it was just me. Like I the holidays, for me it was mainly I would go over to my dad's house and we would you know cook and hang out and watch football and do what not. refer my dad because you know, he was still into the holidays and wanted to get together and celebrate me I don't really celebrate Christmas, I think it's just a commercialized holiday that we've lost sight of what it's really about. And it's."
724.0,Provider,A little bit of that.
15428.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't I mean it's a Christian holiday and i'm not Catholic or Christian anymore, so I just use it as a time to get. Together with family really to spend time with them. But yeah I don't know I don't know where I was going with that i'm kind of off off today, for some reason."
724.0,Provider,that's all right that happens.
15428.0,Patient,"But i'm still sober still sober. I convinced myself over the break that hey it's holiday break man i'm gonna I don't have to stick to my my beer limitation, so I you know when a little hand with with beer over the weekend, or the extended weekend and now today it's like come down to four beers that kind of sucks so."
724.0,Provider,"I was gonna say, are you still calibrate like are like like. Like restricting. You know, again yeah because we can also go down to four."
15428.0,Patient,yeah here's a day.
724.0,Provider,So maybe it was like like a. Like a closure RON somebody who struggle with that where it's like.
15428.0,Patient,"No yeah, but I think it's making things more difficult day because now. i've I was only a couple of days, but I, you know I would kill a 15 pack or whatever now it's like a four beers with like new for me, but it's getting to the point where it's like. that's only four beers like isn't even worth it at this point, so in that regard is getting a little easier yeah. But it's it's harder in general, just to restrict myself. Yes, as you know, I like to go, big or go home."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah extreme but. it's good practice, you know what I mean. it'll teach you like discipline when things are hard like a you'd be able to like start powering through. The power through it a little bit easier, as time progresses, and then you'll be able to apply that might like that mindset that, like other things to where it's like it doesn't have to be extreme you can. You can be comfortable with you know moderate suffering but you'd be able to power through all the building of resiliency so."
15428.0,Patient,"i've come to hard to give up so that's what i've got going for me it's like if it made so much progress, and I can actually say i'm actually proud of myself for once in a long time. yeah absolutely for coming as far that I have so i'm just trying to take it slow and steady and not pile too many things on like attended do and then i'll get overwhelmed and it'll fail."
724.0,Provider,"Well, you. Even have that insight, you know what I mean like it's it's very important, it shows like growth so like knowing what your limitations are what your weaknesses are like weaknesses are and stuff is really important, when trying to tackle goals. Because it'll give you a firmer understanding of what your limitations are so then it's like Okay, so, if I can start overcoming some of those things, and it that'll give you like a boost in confidence and you're like. Like your take on a little bit more I can take on a little bit more the probably you would be like that that extreme one of the other mentality, where it's like. You can you can get deep we're allies over a over like a defeat that could have been avoided if you just scaled back the expectation where it's like it doesn't have to be 100%. But if I want 70% maybe you know that would satisfy both the extreme nature. of your thought process and the realistic approach you know so just it's it's a given take you know what I mean it's it's a little bit of both so don't be hard on yourself like."
15428.0,Patient,"i'm i'm trying, I mean i've kind of realized that like i'm basically relearning how to live and it's weird when I frame it that way, but I was just stuck in my own little bubble doing my my little thing to stagnant for so long it's it's like and. I don't know re learning how to live in a sense, and it's strange because I feel like i'm 36 years old, I should I should I should I shouldn't do like I should I missed it together by the stage, but I don't so i'm that's why i'm here that's what i'm working on."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, good um. What else should we work on so you've decreased or navs to nearly zero. Why don't we why don't we alter that expectation slightly to like Max hour hour and a half, if you do feel like compelled, you know, because you got up at three o'clock this morning you're probably going to."
15428.0,Patient,Be fucking tired later.
724.0,Provider,"you're probably going to hit a wall somewhere, and if you know if you did end up falling asleep super early you know what I mean and then that's not productive, so you know by three o'clock. This afternoon you'd be 12 hours and then, if you're trying to shoot for bed between seven and nine you're looking at like a. You know what like a 16 hour or no like yeah like it's 18 hour day that's. that's kind of a long thing to go from one extreme to the other we've been over sleeping a lot. So now you're yeah so that that might screw them up a little bit more and. cause your progress to kind of slow down, so if you do you know I would encourage a nap today, because things are kind of weird get up early so. set an alarm set to alarms you know, an hour hour 15 Minutes that way oh this get you to be able to power through the rest of the day, so. Yes, sometime relatively soon, maybe around like the the 11 o'clock period of being up you know 11 hours straight maybe take a little power nap you know we set up the carry the rest of the night so try doing."
15428.0,Patient,This where I just remembered I didn't do my homework that you assigned to me. supposed to list things that I like and don't like about myself but.
724.0,Provider,Okay well.
15428.0,Patient,I don't want to think of any of that stuff over the. Over the holiday.
724.0,Provider,"yep and in the treatment planning process like like I put those, like those expectations out for like 90 days like we have about 90 days they get all that stuff kind of like a dress here and there. Because it is a lot, you know if I was assigning you homework, like every week, it would just be like a ton of stuff had become like a chore."
15428.0,Patient,More than during.
724.0,Provider,"You know you'd be more focused on completing those tasks and you would be like anything else, so we have time. You don't so don't feel like. you're rushing it all that stuff you got a lot of stuff that you're trying to accomplish asleep thing is is huge right so. just trying to get that organized you know it's probably going to take you know, a month or two you know, to really kind of get that dialed in and you're you're you're doing your own thing with the the alcohol intake and harm reduction, so. Some of the other stuff we can you know we could table for like when you ever whenever you get around to it and you don't have to sit down and do it in one shot like you could just. Have like a running log or something like that, where something comes to you just write it out and what are the rest of your day."
15428.0,Patient,"sounds better that sounds better for sure. I. see what else, what else is going on."
724.0,Provider,that's super congested.
15428.0,Patient,"you're not getting sick, are you."
724.0,Provider,Well i've always can just get like a screw up knows what.
15428.0,Patient,I got you.
724.0,Provider,into is real bad.
15428.0,Patient,Trying to. scale back on my stupid candle obsession last collection still fucking.
724.0,Provider,He bought more. 7979 okay.
15428.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. I don't know man, it brings me joy it's something I enjoy i'm actually getting into making candles now to have a hobby I think that's something that i've been missing in my life for quite some time and it's just i'm stoked on it, so I just want. gimme gimme gimme i'm really like excited on it so i'm not beating myself over per se. Like i'm not going into bankruptcy buying candles or anything it's just I have to 79 of the damn things. They bring me happiness, right now, so I don't really care. here's a text message her, of course, we need 79 candles but whatever."
724.0,Provider,"I mean you give them out. And you can give them out, but I know that you said, like you, let them all."
15428.0,Patient,Most of them.
724.0,Provider,"All right, so maybe you know, maybe we don't like them all."
15428.0,Patient,Sure sure.
724.0,Provider,"You know now that year, I mean part of like the you know part of the Web rush isn't so much obtaining the the item itself, you know. chase chase you know a lot of times we get wrapped up in that, and then I mean, then, once you have the item you like oh yeah."
15428.0,Patient,well.
724.0,Provider,When it comes to the mail you're like yeah I remember when I ordered this yeah.
15428.0,Patient,"I enjoy I do enjoy the ordering and actively tracking the tracking numbers, the. words that and then getting the delivery itself you're right it's more kind of more enjoyable."
724.0,Provider,And brilliant itself yeah and then getting the cool. part about it on my shelf of here.
15428.0,Patient,"All of those two shelves full candles and my entertainment Center and then one, on the other side."
724.0,Provider,"What is your, what is your girlfriend say."
15428.0,Patient,"My wife, she just kind of left."
724.0,Provider,me alone.
15428.0,Patient,"Like she doesn't she doesn't she gave me a wide eyes, because I told her how much I spent on one of the candles which was was way too much money it's like 65 bucks for fucking candle. yeah see same reaction that you just said. What other than that."
724.0,Provider,"Like to me it's not even like the monetary amount it out to me i'm thinking like. What makes a candle 65 that, like, I wonder, like what they put into it, like those are like gold flakes is like to me like like my head goes on, like a totally different direction where i've taken like a high value. Like what. I wanted what makes it, you know that valuable so."
15428.0,Patient,"Hand blown glass container so that in itself like brings up the price and it's just a really boosie. brand so you know its own brand name. Okay, they can charge more for it. I don't know she just kind of we've always made the joke. Of well at least it's not drugs and this time it's not drugs, so at least we're looking at it in a positive frame that's. My APP that i've been keeping track of my sober days. tells me how much money i've saved as well and it's a like a couple hundred bucks already it's it's staggering to see that number on paper, but how much money i'm spending on shit. yeah absolutely so I don't know I don't know."
724.0,Provider,Yet and you'll see that you'll see that to eventually as the you know the alcohol decreases to not that that that stuff costs a lot of money.
15428.0,Patient,Because over time. Like.
724.0,Provider,Progressive in Asia.
15428.0,Patient,"And I just feel like i'm I think it's good I got up to Orlando really out of sorts of a kind of all over the place, I don't know I don't really have much direction on what how how. How often does Dr groves cut back on a prescription if, like dirt for a missed a group session. Because I think I need to go back up to the my 16. milligrams of suboxone I feel like i'm struggling i'm not in that regard."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you could just let her know like like she doesn't cut your dose down she went if you miss a group children's cut off if she does i'm not even sure, because most people don't miss in that group, so I don't really have a baseline for what her."
15428.0,Patient,"She did she told me, she said you missed group, so I can only write you for eight this week."
724.0,Provider,"yeah she'll write you like, like a script for like five days or something like that right."
15428.0,Patient,It was for for four days yeah for four days yeah.
724.0,Provider,um but she doesn't cut the milligram dosage down.
15428.0,Patient,"No, but rather than take the suboxone for four days and then be without for three and go into withdrawal I just take one. One per day, rather than two a day. So I can get through the week if that makes sense. So, give me give me eight films for the week total. So I was yeah."
724.0,Provider,um.
15428.0,Patient,"it's been like that, for two meetings now because I missed that was just switching said last time, no he said. Because you're missed group last week or whenever it was a couple weeks ago, I can only reach you for eight for the week and I owned it because it was my fucking mistake for permission group but it's like it's been two rituals at this point and."
724.0,Provider,The goal is to not have you go. And missing days.
15428.0,Patient,Right that's why I was confused.
724.0,Provider,"i'm confused too because, because when people like with, I have two other doctors that I work with if somebody misses a group that they provide them a prescription for. Four days, plus one. or it's for the week but, but they have to go to the pharmacy like twice a week or something like that, let me find out so. you're essentially what's your milligram dosage."
15428.0,Patient,"should be at 60 milligrams a day so two films. or one film twice a day. The week that I had missed group she wrote me for eight and I was thankful for that, because I had missed group and I didn't want to be without at all. So I took that, and you know I owned up on that, and then the last group that we have before Christmas break she sent me a message in the chat said because of your miss group, I can only reach you for eight again this week. she gave me refills to give me three refills but my pharmacy won't let me fill it up once a week, so I can show you my bottle I have right there."
724.0,Provider,"that's what it is yeah that's. The refill is so that you have to like you'll you'll be able to. Use you should still get a full week's prescription, but you have to go to the pharmacy like multiple times."
15428.0,Patient,Oh Fuck well okay.
724.0,Provider,"But, but because your pharmacy won't feel that's that's a born right because we never want somebody we don't punish people about by making them, which are all that would be cruel and unusual right it's like it's the punishment is like convenience for you. I guess generally where it's just like you know yeah you got to go like you get for four days or whatever it is, and you're going to go back and get the refill for the for the remainder for the week so. that's what i'm."
15428.0,Patient,Trying to talk to my pharmacy then.
724.0,Provider,I go see your pharmacy. walmart it's in walmart's like will fill you once a week.
15428.0,Patient,"My profession got screwed up because I grew up on Thursdays and I think it was because of this miss group, no, it was when I switched from Sharon over to Dr Dr gross. Where this prescription got called in earlier than it should have so I have basically she calls him my prescription on Thursday during group and I can't pick it up till Monday, because my pharmacy said it's too early to fill it. So it's all it's all jacked up."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's yeah clearly this sounds like there's a pharmacy issue. All right, so. How many refills you have left."
15428.0,Patient,"Three know to refill it yesterday, so I have two left."
724.0,Provider,So they only let you refill like once a week and it's not it's not on Thursday. So.
15428.0,Patient,"The way until like she calls it in, and I have to like sit on the prescription and then call the pharmacy Monday. and say hey this prescription was called in, on Thursday, it was you guys said it was too early, say, a sudden a screen, please fill it out, I usually do."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and then yeah and then you were shorted because. Because the initial refills only bed for a few days."
15428.0,Patient,or eight yeah so rather than. not take any for three days i've just been. Cutting myself down to one film per day. Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah so good so yeah sounds like a pharmacy thing.
15428.0,Patient,i'll call them after this.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and just get like. Because we're will will convey this to Dr groves and see if she can. get them to tighten it up or consolidate the existing refills into one maybe we'll see what she can do you don't make it like if if they're only allowing you. To refill once a week, for whatever reason I don't really know what that logic is about from the on the pharmacy sent like."
15428.0,Patient,"Sound sure, and so I guess I probably insurance I don't know."
724.0,Provider,yeah i'm not sure that's something we'll have to look into.
15428.0,Patient,"Okay they've been struggling with that, like. I feel like in the morning, when I come, like. On that almost caught like pre withdrawal like I just feel my body to starting to change. Like i'll just skip like my money will get super hot, even though it's like been cold over here and they'll start you know getting the cold sweats like."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you're having like like like onset you know withdrawal, but. Because you still have like so Boston your body you're not getting like the full blown what you would call dope sick. Like it's this answer."
15428.0,Patient,"yeah exactly. So yeah if you could check the doctors all called the pharmacy to do my my part on my side and see what they say, but I was much more comfortable with with the one come twice a day for sure."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah i'm going to email her after this and she is only pretty good about responding back so cool okay we'll find out and then you're going to call the pharmacy and just see if they have like a. Five, not one how many refills that you have there and for how many total. And then find out. Why, they only what the reason is that they they only refill you once a week. If it's an insurance thing if it's a walmart policy thing or if it's a personal pharmacists thing is sometimes you know, like like the pharmacist in the in the store. He or she can essentially dictate the entire practice the whole operation, you know what I mean like a doctor could write a script for a bunch of stuff that somebody. You know they turn the script into the pharmacist and he may or she might not like that script at all would be like i'm not doing this. You know what I mean and that's because of their education or they probably know a little bit more about pharmacology than your average doctor does. Sometimes, as far as you know, combinations and effects all that kind of stuff or they just want to be a Dick like you know what I mean like like I had a patient who he tells me that. He lives in a small town and, as far as this is actually like chopped out from behind the counter and boat up on them and. Then you're going to answer the phone when people are calling this place, because you know people, especially the guy didn't like that one of the flight, and so you know there's personalities. All kinds of stuff i'm sure, so you know some biases i'm sure so just get some some information for so then. And then, let us know and i'll give you my email address you can email me like the results you don't have to wait until Thursday the Teller. forward to her it's going to be. See Michel. At bright heart health COM."
15428.0,Patient,Okay that's easy yeah.
724.0,Provider,So it's.
15428.0,Patient,All what you know.
724.0,Provider,"What if I know, whatever they tell you let me know and then i'll forward it to Dr groves to."
15428.0,Patient,Really cool.
724.0,Provider,"That kind of resolved for you, because, like again my goal is not to force, you have the compliance vibe you know precipitated withdrawal that's unethical because."
15428.0,Patient,"Well now, and now that we're talking about it makes sense because she. gave everybody a refill because of Christmas but i'm when I look at my bottle there's three refills something well she's not i'm not to the point where I can go three weeks without you know. Right or sending it in by that, by any means, by any stretch of the imagination, so that that makes more sense yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Because really it's like like a four plus one, or something like that they'll do like four days, and then on the fifth day like they have to refill to get them to the following appointment so it's more like yeah."
15428.0,Patient,I know.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and yeah that that's their thing so. yeah find out, let me know and then we'll go from there cool cool, so let me."
15428.0,Patient,"I was just curious one more thing, how did I do in my surveys. So this last week, I think I think my number went down. On Sunday."
724.0,Provider,Now 1226. On your general anxiety one the gad seven you scored a four so you are at. And on the php nine you scored a five which is minimal so definitely don't like your chart. Like as I look at like the pie graph is like this right it starts on both ends real high there's a slight dip that's back to like slightly higher and then a decent dip comes up and now it's like way down. Your see song like four weeks down two weeks up down up down.
15428.0,Patient,way down way down overall.
724.0,Provider,yeah so it's yeah it's it's trending towards down.
15428.0,Patient,You know cool cool.
724.0,Provider,yeah good.
15428.0,Patient,Good been doing better so.
724.0,Provider,"And then they sense like like some of those those high points, like the previous two weeks or right around the time that, like the slip and stuff so. It makes more sense like like for me as I look at it i'm like okay yep I know exactly what's going on in this time period. yeah why it's good yeah it's good to have."
15428.0,Patient,cool cool Thank you.
724.0,Provider,yeah alright so let's um let's get your point.
15428.0,Patient,I think we can go back to two weeks now i'm feeling pretty confident. overconfident though of course.
724.0,Provider,"And we're still beat week, but you know what I mean so it's like."
15428.0,Patient,yeah i'll see you on Thursday.
724.0,Provider,"Like weekly sometimes today like i'm like literally like like like we still see each other, frequently so. Something comes up and still you don't have to wait two weeks."
15428.0,Patient,"Oh, if something happens you'll you'll you'll know you'll find."
724.0,Provider,"It. Alright, so do you want to stick with this time."
15428.0,Patient,Sure yeah let's do that.
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so that's technically a 15 year."
15428.0,Patient,15 year down the 11th.
724.0,Provider,cool.
15428.0,Patient,And then we do have group on this Thursday right.
724.0,Provider,"We do. And, and the fall roseville be here, the following Thursday. I believe, but i'll still be here so okay."
15428.0,Patient,So that's it for now that's all I got.
724.0,Provider,Have you done any lab work or the.
15428.0,Patient,Oh yeah I did my first at home urine tests that was really weird experience.
724.0,Provider,Out of out of the navy do it.
15428.0,Patient,"Like I got it in the mail like I didn't receive any instructions on how to do this, so I got in the mail and I open the package like looking for what the hell i'm supposed to do. yeah. there's nothing in there yeah they're like wait. Why did you open the package blah blah blah anyways you basically you start the chat you get in a room with somebody you go and you do you're pissing the cup and then you bring it back and you hold your results, up to the camera. it's really weird it's really uncomfortable but. I guess it's better than going in I guess."
724.0,Provider,"So I tell this story right. When I was in the military. for whatever reason, and I was a cop right so. They do random drug test right a lot and. It seemed like me and my buddies like the Dudes that I hung out with the most like my group of guys like we seem to get randomly drug tested the most and.
