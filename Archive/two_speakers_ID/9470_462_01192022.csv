9470.0,Patient,hi. i'm using my computer so.
462.0,Provider,"But it was good that's good yeah getting used to it that's a good thing. Yes, I like your hair."
9470.0,Patient,Thank you. How are you.
462.0,Provider,"Doing pretty good, how are you doing."
9470.0,Patient,i'm okay I didn't know if I was going to be able to get this working that's why I was a little late i'm sorry.
462.0,Provider,"that's okay i'm glad you made it just sent a reminder texts, just in case."
9470.0,Patient,"I was like oh don't know where I couldn't find zoom on my play store my tablet. My husband took my phone, so I was like let's see if I can get this computer to do this, and it does. yeah Brown."
462.0,Provider,"Good yeah it's good actually for you to be practicing, especially if you want to be getting into. School i'm sure there will be some zoom classes and calls and everything nowadays."
9470.0,Patient,"Yes, and i'm. I want you for acceptance from one of a CAP pledge with three colleges. I want to go the Tennessee technology school. But it's public and I offer a lot more classes, there are sent MMA stuff in there for them i'm just waiting to hear back i've been it's been like two weeks so. I don't know if it's longer."
462.0,Provider,"I sometimes it can take some time, especially these days with Kobe everything's a little slow, so I wouldn't be too worried yet."
9470.0,Patient,"Okay, because that's why I was getting nervous I didn't know if I needed to. reach out again or."
462.0,Provider,"mean it doesn't I don't think it ever hurts to follow up politely, you know. And just to ease your mind, maybe that would be helpful, but sometimes i've just been noticing that everything's taking a long time, right now, with Kobe. So yeah. But that's really exciting, I know, last time you were thinking that you want to pick a. practical, realistic career path where you know you'd be able to get a job and everything, have you. had any further thoughts or gotten any guidance on that."
9470.0,Patient,"Almost I don't I don't want to be like a drug rehab counselor. Okay, I always have I want to, I was not always I did want to be a school teacher elementary school teacher, but my felony knocked me out of that. Right so. I thought, maybe I can help other women like me. yeah and. The biggest thing is I can't be on suboxone so."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so to be a counselor you can't be on suboxone is there and. So okay."
9470.0,Patient,"Well rehab counselor like some people that's already being well, I mean if this one if it goes good um, I guess, I could be like a support person like that I know that most rehabs are it's no substance, you know i'm saying."
462.0,Provider,"uh huh I do yeah well that's. The good news is is one of your long term goals is to eventually taper down anyway right so. that's not something that in the long term future would be like a complete you know stoppage to your plan, but it is something to think about right. It adds another layer of. complexity, if you think that that long term plan of tapering down and maybe even tapering off is realistic for you, if you know if you think you could do that and work as a drug rehab counselor so you've got some some thinking points."
9470.0,Patient,"Yes, i've thought about more. I always have Stephen like when everybody that's on like several checks and how they get treated at the Ob gyn and. Also, also think we talked about this. I said i'm going to change the world, I thought it was I will change how people see people. Because not everyone's bad most kids don't I mean. i've my babysitter's never had withdrawal symptom from it, maybe a very light, but not severe enough to be put on medication I think they push more morphine on parents."
462.0,Provider,"yeah you've had some you know experiences with that and a little bit of the discrimination and. You know just being looked down upon and so that could be a really great career path and if you're in a residential facility counseling it might be that you can't be on suboxone but there's also more and more. You know, jobs, like this, where it's digital and it might not be an issue that's just something to to keep researching and looking into what jobs are out there, besides just the Inpatient facilities."
9470.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm i'm trying to I don't know if I. I do want to. Because there's a lot of people that have had that track history is like mine, and I that goes everywhere, with me and kind of medical I go to it goes with it's not fair. And even if there was like a certain type of medication that would help me they wouldn't give it to me because of my past history. There it's like. A couple women and group have been in the same way, they have had problems trying to get a top medication that might help them listen Sir history was such and such that came."
462.0,Provider,With a tornado.
9470.0,Patient,People but.
462.0,Provider,"It is, it is, but you're doing really well just trying to kind of flip the situation and find something better. So you can continue to reflect on that path, and also maybe try to think about other potential jobs that you might be interested in or career paths that might stick out to you do, you have anything else in mind that you think you'd enjoy."
9470.0,Patient,"i'm good with numbers like accounting I can do that. I can do, medical billing I can do it. And I can do pretty much anything but I just want to spend some time i'm happy at."
462.0,Provider,"Absolutely that's important so not all. numbers is helpful, but if you're going to be miserable that's something to consider."
9470.0,Patient,yeah. I don't want to be miserable I wanted to want to be able to pay good because I don't want to waste my time and to achieve paying job that's only getting one bill paid by the end of the week and I spent all my time there wait for my kids away from everything that I actually love. So if it's not going to benefit them as bettering for them it's not worth it to me i'd rather be there with them.
462.0,Provider,yeah very true very true yeah well you got some good thoughts there.
9470.0,Patient,"yeah I don't want to waste my time with them my little ones that I have withering away in a job that's not going anywhere don't have forgiven can that's what was doing I was. Working my little butt off for an A RAD at a store, which I love my customers I love the job. He didn't we didn't get time and a half we didn't get double time we didn't get holiday pay we didn't get overtime, it was always hated to saying over 20 hours was paid under like pay with cash. And it's like he just messes us up we don't get vacation time. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"So right well what you can take away from that is the value of enjoying working with people right, you were I can totally see you be great with customers and enjoying that aspect of it, but you want to be somewhere. Where you're valued a little bit more and a little bit more well respected and just like you said no vacation no proper anything."
9470.0,Patient,"And that's I want I want. Because I have a lot of people that come in and say hey employee they talk to me about stuff while i'm working. And i'm like i'm really good at this Maybe I should do this as a career and i've had that my thoughts for like last five years, but maybe unfailing has put a little cloud over anything I want to do. yeah. And it makes it makes it harder for me to try to get any type of exciting motivation, because I can be just shot down by. just saying hey i'm gonna make a joke felon, what do you have for me. Nothing that's what I usually so."
462.0,Provider,yeah well that's have you so you applied to was it which which school was it.
9470.0,Patient,mutate know. Tennessee technology.
462.0,Provider,Technology. You know if they have any type of a high oh you're so cute. right there that I. should be getting so big i'm standing yeah you're.
9470.0,Patient,"On her own, but she thinks she is."
462.0,Provider,yeah very.
9470.0,Patient,excited. i'm grabbing for things.
462.0,Provider,yeah it's crazy how fast that development goes.
9470.0,Patient,us if I don't want now she's spoken.
462.0,Provider,yeah do you know if that school has a counselor or career.
9470.0,Patient,"classes, so I can take. to lead up to the you know. So all the things that they have a lot of that. No, they actually have a thing in it. i'm waiting on a call back I should get one Monday i'm hoping. Maybe this is too soon, because I call them back, I called him yesterday was Tuesday, because now, I can go to school, the school at called off. For the back wall because we actually had to know so. This is probably the first good day that that snow snow it's all melted away, and I would actually come from one outside I don't like this, no I don't like I feel like i'm going to put my kids in danger, I don't go that makes sense and. I can't control the weather or the ice on the road, so I don't go nowhere. So I don't want to accidentally happen in it be. Negative it's me not knowing how we not understanding how to drive on ice in it, it would hurt one of my babies and of course i'll put the blame on me because i'm like that I always play any kind of blame always turned around. and and think oh i've done this differ if i've done this different it would have been different. But even though it probably wouldn't ever been different. I still do."
462.0,Provider,"Right. You just ruminate and self blame yeah I mean that's fair to be. safe, especially with the infant and young kids."
9470.0,Patient,"A lot can happen until Stephen that a lot can happen it's not about you it's about other people other people don't pay attention of the protection drops of people eat drop staying. In their region Jordan 11 full course meal. Yes, you're looking over there and they're like digging in the bottom, not even looking at the road night oh my gosh i'm a."
462.0,Provider,Little scary in the ice can be so dangerous especially black ice if you can't see it.
9470.0,Patient,"Exactly and I can't see at night so. I don't I don't go anywhere, one is a little bit of snow, even if it's not even on the road, I don't go because that means there's water, which means it. fits temperatures to freeze its. Quarterly there yeah."
462.0,Provider,"So that's why there's been a bit rough there did you move, did you officially move."
9470.0,Patient,But no.
462.0,Provider,Is that still happening.
9470.0,Patient,"yeah yes one small process have it we're trying to. His dad loser. and his that's very nasty human being and I hate to be rude but he don't like to pick up after himself you don't like to pick up after his big oh. I love his dogs they're friendly they're loving but they're as tall, as my they're up to my hips they send that high Okay, and I have this one, and another one, and another. One so. In Bo doesn't really attack or anything like that his head so big it's bigger than her head he gets so excited he wants to come in and love on her."
462.0,Provider,And it takes her brother watch okay yeah.
9470.0,Patient,"And I don't like it i'm. And he's all about his dog since debbie has passed. which I understand that the more that was her dog, and that was her dog. But. If i'm gonna bring my whole home my whole things i've earned and i've created for my family to your House and they get ate up and chewed up by your dogs. it's gonna be a problem for me and you and or my kids toys, the first toy that gets chewed up because I nothing gets handed to me and Stephen we work for every bit we have. So I take very proud and everything I do have because I don't have a lot, so what I do have I love. I think the time and energy to save up for it or. My husband got it because I needed it or I got it for him, because he wanted it for his birthday, or something, but it was like a special occasion that we would ever get something we don't just go out and buy things we want because we can't do that."
462.0,Provider,So basically you're not quite comfortable moving into that place because of maybe the mass than the the very large dogs.
9470.0,Patient,"i'm not as i'm not as wife i'm not trying to take, I take a break kids and a husband all day long. i'm about to take care of your Daddy. And I. just say it like that, but he's a grown man and he for him to live like that is terrible."
462.0,Provider,"Well, you know that's really ferrets living in that type of environment."
9470.0,Patient,"could break down clutter and dirt it's not good. No, I can't do it, I get to the point where i'm depressed I won't do nothing because it's so overwhelming to me that my brain is just shutting down when i'm start doing it's like oh no I don't know I don't even know what to star don't know where to like I just don't."
462.0,Provider,You do have enough on your hands like you. said three kids and a husband so. it's not like maybe miss out the.

9470.0,Patient,"Yes, it will grow I was like baby she is not flat on the back, because I don't I don't let her light there all day long that's just wrong, I feel like so I I like to interact with my babies.

462.0,Provider,"So that is good saw this work done put in is commonly coming but slow but it's coming. yeah it is okay that's good so overall things are going good with the health and feeding how about all the doctors appointments like you said, I know you have a lot of them."
9470.0,Patient,"Are your top ramen but thought. COM, I like I like to anything that can help my babies in the long run. I like to go take them to. Any kind of. They offer like with her being and Nikki Bagley they offer her a lot. And now, for her like people coming out here to see her."
462.0,Provider,"No yeah has this has there been a social worker coming out, you said."
9470.0,Patient,"yeah she hasn't come out since awesome i'll talk to you. I don't think. No, I haven't seen her license last time she was actually supposed to come at the beginning of January, but I haven't heard from her Actually, I have to call her today. and see where she's. she's okay she's supposed to call me after Christmas. After the first. and which I got discharged from them, so I don't know if that's why I haven't heard from are either. Now my discharge papers."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that could be it could be worth following up and then we got your drug screen from the beginning of January, and it was just the beauty so that's."
9470.0,Patient,"A good thing i'm going back to I guess i'm i'm going to day since I know. I need to go today because I they sent me Okay, I want to fast pace, I don't know if i'll talk to you, since this. And I went to do the blood work they see me to do they don't do outside blood work there, so when the matter if I went that day or not, they would have sent me away, and I would. Yes, which got got me very, very irritated. yeah because five went away to the extremes actually walk my button my baby out there, I would already been highly pissed."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's understandable.
9470.0,Patient,"And because ain't no sidewalks from at least halfway from here to that place it's all just rode in grass. So I would have been mad so i'm glad I didn't make that decision I didn't want to put her in danger that's why didn't walk it. yeah I didn't. Go out. and find other ways, but it didn't work out so."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so there's a screening that came in on like the third of January. And again, that was just beautiful so that that's a really good thing as Dr Jackson said anything more about. The next one, are they going to be mailing it to you again."
9470.0,Patient,"i'm shot one point when I got on here the care navigator asked me if I had a box yet so I looked up this morning, so i'll look and i'll go i'll go do that one right here because I don't like the millennium House ever since that happened to me i'd rather. I would rather go out to do my urine. And some of the collective from me, I almost got to the point where I wasn't gonna come here anymore. Because it's it's been a lot on me, I have enough on my plate that more for your mistake or whoever's I don't care, who it was it was a mistake that it was made not by my half. not put my credibility in on this, a lot. In that case, everything to me like you guys have no idea I can explain it and say all day long but. I don't it don't beat without my babies. Is he."
462.0,Provider,yeah you make her heart beat home.
9470.0,Patient,"does get stronger has. Anything bad that I would normally do as a human being, I don't do because I rethink. about them."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. And I know that was a big debacle so again, hopefully, like you said just going in person could be the solution and finding the best place to go where you don't have to walk and just kind of. Getting on track, where it's easier for you it's scheduled and not you know. yeah a big."
9470.0,Patient,"yeah and if not, if I could get my month insurance won't even cover taken me I don't have never heard that before. botanicals anything due to a doctor they've picked me right nope."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's interesting okay. so well.
9470.0,Patient,"I called them that day as an emergency pick up maybe. Like I don't think we take for drug screens, let me go for you and i'll ask. And then i'll come back to you about five minutes later she came back home phone said no ma'am we don't we can take you to a doctor or a doctor's appointments. Any kind of like medical, but if it's just a urine drug screen or but directory and we don't take I was like maybe I shouldn't have said it like that maybe I should have a doctor's appointment."
462.0,Provider,"Appointment right which, in a way, it is, but yeah. it's just frustrating situation overall i'm glad you're still here and sticking through it. And again, hopefully just moving forward, you can have your appointment and then schedule and maybe arrange. Your partner to drive you there every time. same month."
9470.0,Patient,or every.
462.0,Provider,Every month same time and.
9470.0,Patient,Just.
462.0,Provider,Have it be a little bit either.
9470.0,Patient,"yeah i'm trying to ask, but somehow my dad."
462.0,Provider,Oh okay.
9470.0,Patient,"So he's come and pick me and my little ones that we went to his house for a little while and it's what was couple days last week, I went. I really want to go like I sweet I just got over getting colder to us. So, right after I. was terrible Malik I was out all week last week because of it. and And I had it. All right, so awesome beth week before and Stephen had it wrapped flooded. i'll even even literally got charged him forgot haha. anyway. I don't I don't play with him. or anything that could possibly potentially be harmful. I get scared from it i'm i'm a safe person i'm overly safe, but my husband says he says we're supposed to have fun in your life you don't have fun and. I said well i'm Tony that one bad thing he's gonna haunt you for happens and i'm not I don't know I don't want to risk it it's not worth. It to me."
462.0,Provider,Safe safety is important um.
9470.0,Patient,I don't be overly stuff because of the losses and that's probably a big part of it.
462.0,Provider,"But yeah you've been through trauma and losses yourself that will make you want to try to prevent. anything from happening to those that you do love. And it sounds like you're just safe and cautious but not like you're not living life or anything because of it, which is an okay place to be."
9470.0,Patient,"Now i'm living life i'm going to school I. went back to school, hopefully. I got all that almost all my ducks they're good so. I got my baby safe with me, as always, safe I don't have to worry about them in someone else's hands at the moment. cuz I do, even if we're with my dad I worry like a word work it's."
462.0,Provider,"Terrible yeah and his the communication with him been Okay, I know it's a struggle."
9470.0,Patient,"it's been a little better. Like I think I told you about the day he helped me move some stuff over because we moved that load over, and then we haven't moved anymore. Because I when we got there and chuck decided he wasn't going to go nowhere i'm okay I can't afford him to my husband's on one working right now and I spend all the money that we needed a goes that's it. We might have 20 bucks the end of the week. And that's Okay, all my bills, taking care of our groceries are taking care. We have everything we need and the kids. As far as anything goes. luxury might have to save up for a couple weeks for that, but that's okay. And I don't have it, I don't have it to do, I can just fork out. lot bill in a water bill for you to. run my electricity and take a shower which I don't care for time being. If you need somewhere to say, but you don't want to provide it all you don't want to help them all that's the problem i'm having."
462.0,Provider,"yeah you, you know and like you said earlier you've got a lot on your plate that's a lot of pressure on you and it's hard to be in recovery and having you know parenting and being a wife and trying to maintain family relationships doctors appointments. How about self care, do you ever get any just time alone to."
9470.0,Patient,"Not something sometimes i'll get a bath I like to do that sometimes my husband after I get to go to bed, he will run a bath. that's okay sweet he'll put his he'll put those little he bought me these little um. bath bombs."
462.0,Provider,Oh yeah those are awesome.
9470.0,Patient,"And he bought some for me and he'll be like come here and i'm like wow I gotta go full launch or something and he'll just drag me on in there and he's like here, I did this for you and it's all warm steamy looking Gray."
462.0,Provider,With some candles and it's really can't say no.
9470.0,Patient,i'm like okay here.
462.0,Provider,"yeah no that's so important for you to get that every so often so tell him to keep doing that and, like you said step away from folding laundry it can be folded later and let yourself just have a little bit of time to just peace and quiet, you know you time it's really important."
9470.0,Patient,"It is because I know that some some people don't ever get it like for a long time I didn't do it, I didn't do me time and I was, I was. wandering under everybody other problems other than my own myself, I was getting to the point where I wasn't showering I wouldn't get dressed for the day or I wouldn't fix my hair and It made me feel bad about myself."
462.0,Provider,Right exactly.
9470.0,Patient,So I do try to make sure I kind of look halfway decent throughout the day some days are rough more work than others I don't get a lot of sleep some. nights some nights are better than that. yeah. Just sleeping or not.
462.0,Provider,A little bit of something is helpful like you said feeling like you're ready for the day and if you don't feel good about yourself it's hard to give back to everyone else that you're giving back. So just that little something can be go a long way.
9470.0,Patient,"And I try to tell Stephen. Because he always I gotta remember to make him feel the same way, because he's out working his little but."
462.0,Provider,offer to make sure that I had the money that I need.
9470.0,Patient,We have phone when I have a computer male he has this now he has that girl know he's always the one providing that and sometimes I don't think of his needs. Right. Okay i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm not ignoring you I promise.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that could be something for the both of you to talk about how you can each get a little bit of self care for you it's the bath for him, you know what does it look like and how can you support each other to get that time."
9470.0,Patient,"off yeah and I need to do that more for him, so I don't I have so much going on, I forget and then at the end of the day, I see him he's tired all on the table. yeah want to try."
462.0,Provider,"To work all day and now trying to Father and. it's a lot, and it really is."
9470.0,Patient,"And i'm like I he'll fall asleep puts on big about no I think it's disgusting i'm sorry. He will come in here, he will make his boots but they'll be hanging off the bed. For him."
462.0,Provider,Because he's so tired right.
9470.0,Patient,And I was off getting ready for bed like like you. know he appreciates it he wakes up and he stopped hurting from wearing a belt on. So.
462.0,Provider,"yeah okay well that's maybe a goal, there is just to make sure you're getting at least one bath a week and then give him back to him in whatever way is is his self care."
9470.0,Patient,"My dad is trying to help out with the kids. did take them all. One day, and just let me and say you have some time for us is very nice who haven't had it a lot we're always you know bickering back and forth about what needs to be done and we forget about our love for each other and it's. I don't want to lose that. With all the stuff going on mm hmm."

9470.0,Patient,i'm. trying to get our husbands truck fixed we find him in Kentucky. For it already. But we haven't got it from Kentucky and we can't get his truck go on without it.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so what's one step, you can take towards that one."
9470.0,Patient,"I mean, I could save up the money for tourette car dollars for him, but we still need a truck to bring it down. which of course i'm asked my dad. It wasn't him he'll do it. Her nickname is bubbles bubbles bubbles with her lips."
462.0,Provider,Oh. that's so cute.
9470.0,Patient,"she's our our growth right, so it spiked up there, this last time we went to the doctor.
