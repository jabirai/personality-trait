ID,Role,Message
6817.0,Patient,"About five or six times and it just kept saying that it was invalid, it makes no sense at all just kept saying invalid meeting ID."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, no problem, no from your venue."
6817.0,Patient,So i'm trying to use a mobile what little bit of data I have left on on my phone i'm using a mobile hotspot So hopefully we don't lose connection.
207.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, that would have been fine I mean we couldn't we couldn't reschedule if you wanted if there cuz he said that the power line is down in the neighborhood."
6817.0,Patient,"yeah say, but apparently they've been working on it, since last night, my son's been pretty upset too, because he likes to play roadblocks and he can't do that either so."
207.0,Provider,Oh OK. let's go ahead and. check to see how everything is going.
6817.0,Patient,"He said, your House looks pretty."
207.0,Provider,"Thank you. Okay, so where monthly everything. You did you recently. Your screen."
6817.0,Patient,You.
207.0,Provider,"On your screen, did you do."
6817.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know if i've done it this month, or not yet I just I just received it in the mail, because I know the way I like the way it gets mailed to me is off of when I usually. Do it I guess that makes sense I don't know."
207.0,Provider,yeah yeah it says that it was mailed it was mailed.
6817.0,Patient,me yeah I just received. The end of last like Friday Thursday or Friday so. yeah yeah I haven't done it yet.
207.0,Provider,"yeah if you can get it done today because right now it's showing to offset your prescription refill until you get that done so, if you do today, then you should be fine. For tomorrow."
6817.0,Patient,Okay.
207.0,Provider,"And so, also. it's my understanding that ideas, want to be out possibly. So, will it will be."
6817.0,Patient,The rest of the year.
207.0,Provider,yeah. and
6817.0,Patient,"It makes it seem long. And then I started thinking i'm like well holly it's almost November it's literally like a month. A month it's literally already basically have them anymore, in the last week of."
207.0,Provider,October so yeah we're in the last week and we only have group. Three times next month for October or November. So i'm not having group on thanksgiving day.
6817.0,Patient,"That works for me, since i'm. On bi weekly anyway stopped."
207.0,Provider,She will just pretty sure just fill your prescription and. she'll just.
6817.0,Patient,fill your prescription know you have to stop talking. yeah.
207.0,Provider,And then your next group is on the 11. which was technically take you over into that so she would have to fill your script prescription.
6817.0,Patient,My next appointment would be thanksgiving day.
207.0,Provider,yeah so she would have to fill it until the week after thanksgiving. Okay sounds like an extra weeks or whatever. yeah.
6817.0,Patient,"I always feel like i'm out of the loop sometimes because I am bi. weekly, and I feel like sometimes you know things get discussed in the weekly groups, but sometimes people forget that not everybody comes every. Every week so sometimes i'm like when I found out that he was leaving it was like a week or so after everybody else but already found out that she was leaving."
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean yeah because I well, I think, with her, she did she didn't know a whole month in advance that she was leaving and so she has started making the announcement. So it's just been yeah I don't think this is a case of him, leaving, I guess, he has whatever he has going on, personally, and so."
6817.0,Patient,I figured it was it was somehow family stuff.
207.0,Provider,"Over a house, I mean your your your chart looks pretty good and everything is still."
6817.0,Patient,yeah they had me repeat my surveys from the week before last i'm.
207.0,Provider,not really.
6817.0,Patient,"sure why, but I did I. On Monday I had done because originally my appointments were on Monday and we finally got that straight now um so I did the I did the surveys on Monday, and then I did them on Thursday before group, and then they emailed me, I believe, last Friday, and I did them over the weekend again."
207.0,Provider,"i'm looking at your I don't know why they specifically they would ask you to redo them, but just in reviewing your survey right now is showing. Your depression scale is mild but your anxiety and. Pretty moderate. So, have you moved around the patient satisfaction. 12121 patient satisfaction I think is done either every quarter, I believe, is what."
6817.0,Patient,"I thought it was maybe because maybe they just didn't receive. My surveys, or something, because they said I was missing in is what the email said and i'm like thinking to myself, no I shouldn't be missing it I did it twice last week."
207.0,Provider,"yeah no no you're just. All your surveys are completed completed, did you move running."
6817.0,Patient,"No, not yet."
207.0,Provider,They.
6817.0,Patient,"They still have. They still have some things that they need to get done on their own, which i'm hoping that they're getting done this week and she's only in the office there on I believe Wednesdays and Thursdays um the bathtub like it's funny and. You know, like. Sometimes, instead of actually fixing something all the way they'll just place a bathtub inside a bathtub."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6817.0,Patient,"Like inside like the old frame or whatever well where they did that they didn't seal it correctly, it moves like you can stand in it and you could feel the water. And everything underneath so they have to do that i'm i'm a little concerned about the fridge. it's half the size of the one we have here, which is just a normal sized fridge um i'd say it's about 10 cubic feet worth tops. And I don't really know how they think that that's going to be enough for you know six people. And in my opinion, and then there's some other little odds and ends like that it has a half bath in it which makes no sense either because it's an apartment right you've got your full bath and your half bath. right there together. But the toilet wasn't working it wasn't filling it wasn't flushing and i'm."
207.0,Provider,closets we're missing something complex they they have all kind of snuck out.
6817.0,Patient,I don't know.
207.0,Provider,um so your arm So when I was wondering.
6817.0,Patient,I think it's just kind of where she probably bit off more than she can cheer you know what I mean kind of promising people that things would be done before they actually you know can be done not allowing for enough time okay.
207.0,Provider,"gotcha so So when are you going to move at the end of November, when are you looking."
6817.0,Patient,"I know. we're supposed to be moving i'm moving this week is what we're supposed to be doing, I did let you know the. No, no. that's part of the problem that that's part of the anxiety that I mean it's just it's just one thing after another hill a late stop ever. And the kids go behind me just destroying shit i'm trying to get it all, you know organized and cleaned up so that it can be all packed up because I was just gonna you know put a bunch of bed and totes. They destroyed all the boxes that I got they just keep making messes everywhere, it seems like one step forward is absolutely 10 plus back."
207.0,Provider,um who's helping you pack up outside of your case.
6817.0,Patient,Not one just me.
207.0,Provider,i'm gonna help you move.
6817.0,Patient,"My girlfriend's supposed to have people that claim that they can help. Final know right now. I don't know for sure I don't really I don't have anybody. I told her you know she could line up anybody, I will pay them for their time, I just want to rent a u haul and get it all moved in one day for the most part, you know, besides little odds and ends that I might need to come back for something. But now that that's the part that's been the most stressful and. i'm just like I don't know, to the point here lately, and I am i'm a warrior and i'm just someone who constantly worries non stop but i'm, to the point where I just want to throw my hands up because I mean what the hell, can I do. I can't force people to help me move. I you know I can't force people to help, so I mean at this point i'm just I don't know. Hoping in one hand and wishing, then the other."
207.0,Provider,um then everything has to be loaded up on and brought over.
6817.0,Patient,"Well that's Nice, I was gonna write a u haul because I mean there's a pickup place right near where i'm at right now and there's a drop off real close to where i'm going to."
207.0,Provider,Oh.
6817.0,Patient,"And I mean. I intend on not taking half of what I have here, you know what I mean like my place is cluttered now like I moved from. Or you know was forced to move from a House that was twice the size of this one and I didn't want to lose things I still last things I didn't want to lose any more than what I had to and it's just it's been a cluttered mess here. everything's just kind of on top of each other and I don't want that I want to be more minimalistic because I cannot handle. But I don't know the cluttered mess in your home absolutely, in my opinion it impacts you it impacts your mental health and impacts, a lot of stuff and I can't handle it anymore cannot do it cannot do is just more for the kids to make mess with. Interesting they can make a mess with anything mine can. And what's worse is it's my oldest it's not the five and six year old. it's the 11 in the nine year old."
207.0,Provider,kids right. yeah um.
6817.0,Patient,"it's like we're 11 going on, you know, three I don't understand it."
207.0,Provider,And how are you doing all this while homeschooling.
6817.0,Patient,"we're just doing little like we just want to cut back, so this week we just been doing, I cannot have the lines that we would typically do."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and um so you have a you have a date that you have to be out of this current location by right."
6817.0,Patient,"Technically speaking, yes and that's why I was saying, I did reach out to the other person. And I let them know that the apartment there was not ready, and then I was not sure if I would be out on that exact date that i'm hoping. To be out as close to it as possible, but you know if they you know could be understanding, because at least I did you know at least I did the rest, at least I did find a place to move which was hard enough. and things are in order, it's just a matter and I did explain to them that I also didn't have anyone, you know lined up that I could depend on to help me move yet. either, but I mean you can't hardly move in it's not just a couple of issues it's not like it's just the closets are missing doors that wouldn't be a big deal, I mean you literally can't take a shower right now. So."
207.0,Provider,"yeah. It is hard to pronounce. from others, and I do understand what you're saying. In terms of waiting. For people to. Get in the mood and that can increase your anxiety as well, but. At the same time it is. You it's it's doing every little thing and kind of like want to pack and kind of suck things up the one year when the official date for you to move then it's just loading enough. I mean the worst thing to do with always. it's very stressful when you gotta clean up and ensure that everything is out of it."
6817.0,Patient,"And that's why I know. outside of the actual like throwing stuff in a box or you know, a toner whatever that's why i've been trying to go through, and you know clean up like you know get anything. From behind her under furniture that way when it does get moved out that's that that's the you know, the end of it. But they just keep going around making more masses like and i'm not talking to my kids don't make normal messes. they'll just you know, maybe leave their toys out or you know not put some of their clothes away my kids destroy the whole they destroy it like. I know I know, no one understands until they've been around it no one's like you know there's no way holly it can't be that bad. there's no way it can until they're here for like babysit one day or until they're actually no around it and I don't know what to do, they don't care they don't care. They don't care if the rooms are you know REX they don't care if they throw their trash on the floor, even though they know better, even though they know they're not supposed to, even though they get punished for it, it just it doesn't matter I don't know. smelt like chaos. Like uncontrolled chaos and."
207.0,Provider,Having a plan. in place and just try to execute that plan.
6817.0,Patient,"On the problem is only you know when you only got one or two on board with executing said plan and everybody else's you know, on board with making sure to ruin any way that you might execute it like. Like I said, my youngest to they they behave they listened, for the most part. But the oldest to have just been. Basically, if I say that this needs to be done with that we need to do that, we just do the opposite. it's like the rules don't exist anymore, to the oldest one she thinks she can do whatever she wants Whenever she wants."
207.0,Provider,to play. And structure for them and say this is what's going to happen.
6817.0,Patient,"Well, I think that's the issue i've always been kind of like a pushover I guess I don't like you know where my kids to get punished, and you know they're not allowed to get away with doing wrong, I also don't want to be the bad guy all the time either. And i'll give chances and I know that that was my mistake right there ever given a you know, a third or fourth or fifth chance to you know correct or wrong, because now they think mom's just saying it moms can actually do it and think that they can just run all over me."
207.0,Provider,"i'm so so then it's, such as the case if you are able to identify. What I."
6817.0,Patient,fix it. I don't know how to fix it like just stopping giving chances is not working it's not fixing it.
207.0,Provider,Like I thought you're also identifying that you know prevent. Your easy pushover and if you for them you're easy pushover then it's coming to that place of. Identifying when they're trying to manipulate a situation when they're trying to get away with a situation.
6817.0,Patient,But how you fix it because I can eat I mean I can even do that much I can identify it I don't know how this. I don't know what is it what is it.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, is it is it that you don't know how to fix it or is it there's a part of you that feared their response to you and you possibly. losing them because you remember you also came from. An abusive relationship and. With that abuse there's there's there's some level of anxiety."
6817.0,Patient,"I think sometimes it might be um you know them being like well i'm just gonna go here because I can get away with murder, you know types of like I don't know I think sometimes that that does lie in the back of my mind, but I don't think that I don't think that's the biggest issue. I don't know we're."
207.0,Provider,"Talking about we're not talking about the biggest issue that's the thing we can look at what the big issue is like what is the big problem but remember. It before anything gets big it starts off small right. everything starts off very small before it gets big so you have to identify if it's not a big thing that's going on but it's a little thing and there's those little things because, how does the Tower recognize that oh mom is a pushover or mom is just saying what she's saying, but then. You know, maybe."
6817.0,Patient,"Maybe even here recently in the last two weeks, they will sell as much I know she's not really going to do it she's just saying it like she always does."
207.0,Provider,"And then you need to see if they're able to plan it out, then it comes down to you needing to stick to your guns. And let them realize that you're serious."
6817.0,Patient,"And I sell as much, and I. don't want to I don't want to have to like be the bad guy but."
207.0,Provider,"But. But you will need to redefine what is a bad guy because. This is the let me ask you this, are you trying to be your are you trying to be their mom or you're trying to be."
6817.0,Patient,"that's why I saw them I tell them, you know i'm not you know we have your mom first in your parent first. Okay we're not equals and that's why I, like my oldest and that's The other reason why I can easily identify the i've been a pushover because even my oldest you know she treats me like we're equals we're not i'm the parent i'm the it's all the household."
207.0,Provider,you're arguing back with her.
6817.0,Patient,"As far as arguing, I would say no, as far as saying as much as I just said, you know that we're not equal so i'm there at all, I have said that much."
207.0,Provider,Okay.
6817.0,Patient,"Well, now they want us to know and argue back. They do, but I don't sit there and engage."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, which is naturally what children are always going to do, but then, my question is what type of conversation what are, what is the relationship, you have with such child or children. If. They want to be challenging because you also have to identify what is your relationship, what is the foundation of the relationship that you're creating for them. or, for that child. Yes, identified that, because then that becomes where the issue lies it's that you're. The issues and allies, or the problem then live with you know what type of relationship, are you fostering with with. Any one of your kid that's why children think your your your equal that's the kind of conversations that you engaging with them it's the way you deal with them, are you."
6817.0,Patient,"i've already thought back to mistakes i've made. conversations. You know i've always been i've always wanted to you know preach the open and honest which. it's it's been good, in some ways, but it's been really bad in other ways it's came back to bite me in the ass because of what you just said. You know, sometimes some of the conversations that i've had with them, have made them think that we are that we're you know equals for brands we're pals. That i'm not their parent i'm not you know, ultimately, the head of this household or Boston this household or whatever you want to you know call it."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6817.0,Patient,"But i've already said and done, that at this point like. i've already got."
207.0,Provider,"It but it's not but it's not so much that you, you so it's a matter of recognizing it and changing because it's one thing to recognize what i've done it's another. And that's really, especially with your your children as they get older, you would want to you kind of lower the bars, are you kind of with. With boundaries you set boundaries with someone when you say Okay, given their age and their level of intelligence, but then with children they're always going to see how far they can push the block. incense right let's see how much further, I can go and then, if you don't. If you don't recognize again stop it, and then they're going to keep going and going and going."
6817.0,Patient,Here lately it's just a snowball effect.
207.0,Provider,"But it's not a matter no parents do it do it, but then it's recognizing."
6817.0,Patient,"feeling well or you know just right now, like when I when i'm on the phone or whatever they take advantage of all those situations if i'm in the bathroom. You know whether i'm going to the bathroom or whether i'm showering the minute mom's back is turned they think that they can do whatever they want."
207.0,Provider,"But again it's still grounding ultra all children are like that your children are no special than other children. Also in our lifetime when you're on the phone or when your when your attention is also met or you're not fully engaged in whatever it is that they're doing that, when they decide. To go to town on everything that's wrong, and so, because you're in depending on the the the importance of that phone call that you're on our activity that your engagement. So then, therefore, the minute that you are your attention is no longer occupied by whatever it was then at that point is that you implement certain rules. And if that and if it means coming with a level of punishment going in timeout or whatever it is, but then it's not just a one time it's the consistency it's you being consistent about it eventually they are going to learn. they're going to want."
6817.0,Patient,"yeah i've been trying to you know, be more consistent, as far as like the punished, but they don't seem to care like they'll be mad but."
207.0,Provider,"But then it's not that they don't care, of course, they care, but are you consistent with who essentially if your chat is not matter to half the time and barely yeah."
6817.0,Patient,"I wasn't I wasn't ever consistent with it, but have I been in the last you know, probably six months, yes, has it made a difference, no, no, it has it."
207.0,Provider,But it goes.
6817.0,Patient,"To the youngest. Who, you know strict in their little butts up but."
207.0,Provider,"This is the thing it goes back to. Are you carrying out that okay so, for example, I have a little one here. And is he my little baby, of course, you see my little heartstrings of course he's the youngest. Right and every time I look at him, you just want to eat him up and just that's just. You know my little that that's my final child, there is no other coming after you."
6817.0,Patient,know I know I know the exact feeling. you're talking about yeah.
207.0,Provider,So a lot of the times that he does things now Does he know that this little let you know that he can float with a lot of course he does. He does and does he play me and it like a fiddle in front of his siblings.
6817.0,Patient,or whatever.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and then they will do their wrong and then they'll give you the face and while they're giving their older siblings a smirk right and what you don't do mommy to my rescue. And so, eventually, I started recognizing the pattern and I started recognizing that he is pulling me like a fiddle so, then what I said all right, enough is enough. And what that will do that will get the older siblings especially his older brother who he is like he. adores his older brother he does so, everything that he does wrong, we always go after his older brother because 95% of the time his brother, Minister. And so we always go after but then I recognize that also use that to his advantage, so when dad will yell at the older and i'm like no that's not fair, because at the end of the day he knows what he's doing I saw the pattern So what did I do I started punishing the."
6817.0,Patient,"Line have tried finding each other to and i've told them. Okay, whether or not you know she's the reason you did it did you make the conscious choice to follow her after you. Already told to come to mom first. to let mom know that hey basically just you know, took off on the bike after she was told not to for like you know the hundredth time. And instead you decided to follow her, and then you want to come back and want to say it was all her fault well she didn't force you, you know, to follow her, she forced you to go, you could have came in and told me and instead you decided to go with her."
207.0,Provider,"Now, now, this is the thing other children know the the older siblings also know that mom is occupied with more than one kid so. They take advantage of that so what I did with my little one. Because now I start being consistent up on punishing so even when he comes to me with those cute little half open brown eyes and he looks at me and it's melting my heart, what do I do. Even though it's messing up my heart, and even though there's a saying that it is hurting me buddy more than it's hurting you it's literally serious, the fact that I have to punish you it's hurting me way more than interrupting you because I don't."
6817.0,Patient,make you upset.
207.0,Provider,"But you still have to carry out. And so being consistent with that is that there they'll get upset so I remember one time my son said Oh, the older one says oh. My son, the little one mumbled or oh mom is the worst and, of course, initially did I feel bad because he was like oh my God i'm the worst, but then I recognize. he's using his word, so I am going to if if one tactic didn't work. and go to the next, and if the second tactic didn't work i'm going to go to the third, so the child is going to go to each tactic and once they recognize that they're going to fail at each because i'm standing my ground. guess what am I going to fold her there, nor are you going to conform to what I expect of you. And that's ultimately where it comes down to they will conform to what is expected, but it comes down with consistency now holly it is going to be hard, because even in whatever example i'm sharing with you, it also takes the support of another parent and I understand as a single. mom it's."
6817.0,Patient,so hard.
207.0,Provider,"It is hard, but again."
6817.0,Patient,When I go there and they. Every other weekend.
207.0,Provider,consistently they go every other weekend.
6817.0,Patient,"uh for the most part, I mean it's not always consistent like there's been a month here and there, that he didn't get on but, for the most part yeah. So yeah it's consistent, as he can be because he knows that he has control."
207.0,Provider,"And so does the kids the kids i'm. Trying to manipulate and say when they're upset with you, I want to go to bed and i'd rather stay with their."
6817.0,Patient,"um no because they hate him. They don't even call him dad I mean they they call him his by his name. Oh good no instead they just say I don't want to live here anymore, and then I tell them that's fine I said, you can go live with you know your other parents."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm but see you also regardless of what it is i'm holly it still comes down to I don't want to live here anymore okay that's where you gotta go currently The other option is is.
6817.0,Patient,"They seem to think and that's where I said, you know kind of where I was drawing the line they seem to think that I just want to not to them. And I don't want to."
207.0,Provider,"But OK, but this is a true they seem to think that you won't do that to them, but is there a fear that if you don't play your cards right, you can possibly lose your children, you have to tap into is that a legitimate concern and fear that you have because, if it is. If it is. But that's something that you have to re evaluate because, if it is holly it also will play a role into why it's hard for you to stay, consistent and implementing discipline."
6817.0,Patient,"And my word together, it was. Like even then it was still it was still hard for me to stay consistent because, again, I mean he wasn't hardly ever paid the kids much mind. And I talked to be the one implementing the rules wow he would just let them do whatever the hell, they wanted. Because he won't even paying attention to them most, the time, not because he didn't care because i'll get scream and yell at them, but because he wasn't paying any attention to them, because he was too busy doing what he wanted to do. So."
207.0,Provider,"Do you find that you have. Do you find is that you. Like when you look at even your own upbringing. With your own upbringing, do you. um. Do you think that you got away with a lot or there was a lot more structure and."
6817.0,Patient,"No, no, I didn't get away with crap I got blamed for things I didn't even do."
207.0,Provider,So do you think that there was a lot you grew up with a lot more structure and a lot more.
6817.0,Patient,"roles, I mean. I mean people referred to my dad is Hitler because that's how. that's how I mean they call him Captain sergeant he had all kinds of names, but they all refer to an authoritarian type person. And it was always his way or the highway and."
207.0,Provider,Do you think that it was a bad thing.
6817.0,Patient,"In some ways, I do because the rebel when my parents got divorced yeah."
207.0,Provider,Do you think.
6817.0,Patient,Rules that we didn't even have a life like. I mean we're talking not like. Good roles were just talking like we're not allowed to be kids we weren't allowed to go anywhere everyone a lot to do any.
207.0,Provider,"Do you think that, as a parent you try your best to be the complete opposite of that was."
6817.0,Patient,"Not the complete opposite but, for the most part yeah."
207.0,Provider,"And so, sometimes, this is what happened because my parents were a certain way i'm going to make sure that i'm not that type of parents and my children, so you become a leader Eric parents for. Not an uninvolved but just one of those parents that are very laid back, and so this is the thing if you honestly I want you to take a moment just to look back. was even though your parents were very strict or However, your dad was do you think that it was all bad now that you're an adult looking back, and now you have your own kids do you think all of it was that."
6817.0,Patient,"No, I said I don't think all of it was bad no because. I knew far more responsive, I mean I was far more responsible at my oldest age so much she is. I mean i'd say responsibility wise. You know she's got the maturity of a seven year old."
207.0,Provider,"girl, because I see, this is the thing this is what we do, we generalize. My parents were horrible or my parents were like this, or they were like that, and we take that this is the complete thing in comparison to identifying what areas. Would I not repeat and what areas will, I repeat, so what are some of the strength of my parents that I can pass on to my children or I can utilize for myself that I will work from my parents. and pass on and so that I can raise up children that have discipline and that has structure and are respectful and will become productive members of society in comparison to generalizing all of it, everyone has that. Everyone has that we just have to learn to identify So if you reflect back on your own upbringing and your parents. that's the reason why you have such struggled because you're trying your hardest, not to be the the the the the parents that you had, but if you can identify what was some strength, even if your dad was. Even if it ain't ever seen about hipaa law that was that it wasn't everything that was horrible there were some things that were not so good, and so, then. Something simple as one i'm not being able to have freedom to be able to go to arm, you know what that's a bad example because I ain't gonna lie I don't allow my children go nobody helps because you know what I don't know what. I can't say."
6817.0,Patient,"i'm just saying, like in general, like he just like, even if it was to work on a school project or whatever, like, I mean we had we never went to school dance, I never went to a problem, I never went to home, like outside of going to school for school that was it. period."
207.0,Provider,"So taking that concept taking that and I agree with you, taking that concept and applying it to now you being appealing and you were selecting back and you say okay. I grew up in a different era in a different time and it wasn't so bad if I compare it to know, can I allow my children to go to school, there, yes, but within certain reason. Can I allow my children to do certain things, yes, given the the era that they are living in, and what it is, you know people are capable of I can allow it, but we're not going to open the floodgates. So, like, I have an older child what mommy can I go here, no can I go to the mall at my friends, no okay well mom you don't want a friend invited me to a. theater is what she just said to me she's like you know, is it Okay, if I go sure go ahead, am I going to say yes to everything. Right, but will I allow something, of course, but then at, but at the same time she tells me a lot about the friend she's always talking about these different people. And so, then therefore i'll pick and choose and i'll say you know what go ahead it's fine but i'm not going to allow everything now, when I was growing up just like you was I allowed to go anywhere and do anything no I wasn't but as a parent. I don't think I ever had a friend over."
6817.0,Patient,The only friend that we were ever allowed to have our was our neighbor she was a you know she was younger than me and she's just she was a very annoying little girl that was. In rehab.
207.0,Provider,"When you were growing up to comparison to now. It would, I really care for anybody to come to my house no breathing."
6817.0,Patient,"And I, I understand that, but. Back then, I mean again back in the early 90s, it was different."
207.0,Provider,From it is now and so.
6817.0,Patient,"With it being now you have too many. You know kids growing up too fast and. Exactly what the adults, you have to worry about."
207.0,Provider,"It I know you for no reason, so this is the thing having those type of conversations with your children, so in being open."
6817.0,Patient,"It mean, I feel, like all parents are more stressed out nowadays to I don't want anybody else's little kids coming over and stressing them out like. I got enough, we got enough."
207.0,Provider,"But it's but, again, it is taking everything. Within perspective and and and re evaluating it and I it sounds to me holly. There is two things that you're working against you're working against your own upbringing and how your parents work how your family of origin work. And you're trying to be someone the opposite of that was and when we when we do that we don't recognize that we are creating monsters within our children in certain areas, simply because. We take a super laid back approach in comparison to. Re evaluating what exactly about my upbringing, that I didn't like. What exactly about that is it that there was no balance was it that my dad was way too extreme in comparison to having a little balance. wasn't that my mom was completely uninvolved in the sense that she made my dad do everything, and so, when they divorced, then I just went book, while to go enjoy my freedom."
6817.0,Patient,or some weren't involved.
207.0,Provider,They were or we're not.
6817.0,Patient,"we're not. gonna give you five good memories from her childhood, she would not be able to do it, I."
207.0,Provider,So therefore.
6817.0,Patient,I flunked out a lot of my childhood to like I don't remember being a kid.
207.0,Provider,Think.
6817.0,Patient,that's about it.
207.0,Provider,"But you have to re evaluate and say. My parents just didn't put down healthy balance and that's what you have to say I want to have a healthy balance with my children, and this is what it should look like, and this is how I would like it to be. And this is ultimately there was something on, I want to say was most of it on tick tock or snapchat one of them, stop on things that we could do. And so my daughter she showed me and it said, my parents are strict but then they're not they'll, allow me to go out, but then they won't it will allow this, but then again they won't. it's basically it's a healthy balance between the two because there's some things that are not allowed, but then there's some things that are allowed. Everything is based on the circumstances situation and whatever is going on at that time."
6817.0,Patient,I will say everything's situational.
207.0,Provider,"Everything is situational. it's all situational, but it is, it is a conversation that can be had and it's a consideration can that can be done. And so, when it comes on two years now, are you overwhelmed are you exhausted, are you. burnt out. Yes, you are, and I think it's coming to that place Yes, you are and because you are all these things, and then you have your your health issues and everything and because you are. It makes it very hard to implement the discipline and the structure and remain consistent with it with all five of your kids. When was the last time you had some time to yourself completely for yourself."
6817.0,Patient,I don't know.
207.0,Provider,Is it a year to three or you're always with them.
6817.0,Patient,I mean outside of a concert here and there.
207.0,Provider,And when was the last time you went to a concert by yourself.
6817.0,Patient,Like two years.
207.0,Provider,"So it's been two years of you just constantly going at it so you're overwhelmed you're burned out. it's very hard for you to stay consistent, there is no break. And you don't have anyone that could allow you to just if you want to go get your hair done if you want to go get a menu and petty."
6817.0,Patient,know.
207.0,Provider,"you're broke up you're tired you're exhausted. And because you're all these things you just let them do whatever because that's the only mentally it's, the only way go do whatever. I told you a million times over writing down the street i'm so tired, I need to care go to whatever. They tell us don't allow children to be on the tablet on their gadgets for very long, you know what is it keeps them quiet and away from me, so I can just watch a 30 minute show in peace, then go do it. But that's not healthy, are you going to take them from me soka different types of myself."
6817.0,Patient,I can't tell you the last time I watch TV.
207.0,Provider,"you're tired you're tired and exhausted and that's part of the reason why it's so hard for you to implement friction. When I had coven. I binge watch netflix. And I was only able to binge watch. netflix during school hours. So you think about if I was able to do it. And that is in the House, I was only able to do it during school hours. In peace and quiet and fully watching and understand what's going on. What about you, who never disappoint. And who's doing it on your own, so it is okay to acknowledge and say I am tired. I am burnt out. I want to break I need a break it is okay to say it. And even if you have a girlfriend who you trust and it's, this is the thing it's okay to also tell if you have one or two friends that you're pretty cold cold it's okay to ask hey can you guys help me out is it okay for the kids to combine just one."
6817.0,Patient,"I have they just don't care. I don't know you know if it's just because they're stressed out with their own life or if it's just because they just you know. They don't want any more than what they already got on the right, you know what I mean like she's got two kids have grown and I just think she just doesn't want to add anymore I don't know. That I mean maybe set a time or two not from the hallway to go do anything. She wanted to go do, but you know when I. When I needed it for like an appointment, or something and."
207.0,Provider,When they make.
6817.0,Patient,sure that my kids overwhelmed her.
207.0,Provider,When they go to dance how often How long do they. Oh.
6817.0,Patient,she's the youngest three anyways.
207.0,Provider,So you okay so you're you're never without. What about the older.
6817.0,Patient,That was me 24 seven.
207.0,Provider,What about.
6817.0,Patient,Not not involved never has been.
207.0,Provider,disappeared disappears completely not.
6817.0,Patient,very much.
207.0,Provider,The first to have their own it's the same bad or.
6817.0,Patient,No.
207.0,Provider,So it's just one of those where. Parents are still alive right.
6817.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,And there you don't speak to them or see them.
6817.0,Patient,"Now, not that we've really never been on speaking terms, I tried, but we can't beg someone to be a parent, and I would never. ever want to have to be lots."
207.0,Provider,And they don't even.
6817.0,Patient,know.
207.0,Provider,you're just always along. So when we when we do the anxiety scale into depression scale back right away.
6817.0,Patient,"At this point, I mean a lot of times it's probably higher than it really is i've just learned how to. deal with it, I guess, better. Absolutely not."
207.0,Provider,"But let me answer when you move, are you going to put them in school, all of them."
6817.0,Patient,"um I don't know about all of them, but yeah i've already thought about that i've already. something's gotta you know something's got to give something's got to be done."
207.0,Provider,"But that's something that you have to consider holly all having them at home, all day, would it not be."
6817.0,Patient,"yeah I know it's getting too it's getting to be too much. it's been too much for a while everyone thing if my kids behave I mean they're out of control, like the oldest to especially they are just out of control, with the lying in the manipulating and. Just regarding all rules and."
207.0,Provider,"When you say, disregarding all."
6817.0,Patient,"Like there's no rules. I mean they've stolen from people my ones broken to my neighbor's house, I mean."
207.0,Provider,i'm. Miss type of thing not a condom. But it's the one where um. I can't think of the name but. Did they get arrested.
6817.0,Patient,"No, no, my neighbor didn't do anything about it. Which kind of bothered me, I never knew anything about it, I mean, even if you want them. Tell them to get inside now like right now running out the back door, because i'm on the phone. All day long if I don't follow my kids around. Like little like literally follow them around from room they won't do a damn thing you asked them, not a damn thing if you asked him to pick something up and go throw it away unless you follow them to go pick it up, it goes right away any happening. not been raised, like that."
207.0,Provider,And you can't. Speak to.
6817.0,Patient,Go sit down. Go sit down. i'm sorry.
207.0,Provider,"Honey you. You have to reconsider it now, was it that even what part of the reason why you took them out, I know you were having some issues with it, that they were getting suspended."
6817.0,Patient,"Now he only got one in school detention i'm the one that you know, did the other crap the lying and stealing but um we were just we were having other issues with the school. Especially with a third little resource officer. They were really disrespectful and once they were already legally homeschool they even showed up again and tried to take my kids out of my home and tell me that I was lying that they were not legally like it was a whole thing I remember talking to you about it when it happened, but. I just I don't know I felt really uncomfortable even taking my kids they're my kids fold them comfortable there. It was almost. It almost felt like they were just constantly judging."
207.0,Provider,You know.
6817.0,Patient,Because i'm just you know because i'm a single mom of five and.
207.0,Provider,"But it's so are you, is it something that you want to consider is letting them go to school, when they when you go to the other location is letting them go to school. Because, maybe that's another thing they want to interact, you know outside of the neighborhood kids the kids in school, and you know from their social skills is the lapel pin because it doing it did the truth of the matter is, do you really have the energy."
6817.0,Patient,i'm sorry I just turn the camera off again.
207.0,Provider,"I said, do you really even have the energy. To. You really have the energy to go home cool."
6817.0,Patient,I mean. That would be the easiest part of everything else.
207.0,Provider,So that's that's another thing you don't have the energy to do the homeschooling so.
6817.0,Patient,that's been you know less hard than everything else.
207.0,Provider,This is what I would recommend that you do. This is what I would recommend that you.
6817.0,Patient,Know Lillian put it down and go.
207.0,Provider,"This is what I would recommend that you do is for you to. Wherever you're moving to is to explore this what school, it is, and even consider having them all go to school and it's within you know, the first semester or quarter or whatever it is that they're going there, and you find that makes it better at home for them to go back to homeschooling. You burnt out holly you are you're burned out. you're burned out."
6817.0,Patient,I know.
207.0,Provider,"Numbers out with three children and I live with their dad I can't imagine you by yourself market. Your you're tired and it's and it's because you never have a break. Okay, so it is um you know, right now, it is focusing on the move, but at the same time also maybe if you want to wait until after the holidays it's just consider and maybe after the holidays. Excuse me, which is thanksgiving and Christmas whatever works best and then a reoccurring load and back in school. For us to try to do it all on your own you're being defeated. What is it, what do you do to help the corporate structures that you have."
6817.0,Patient,Do I.
207.0,Provider,What do you do to cope with the stress.
6817.0,Patient,I don't even know. sleep.
207.0,Provider,How long the week.
6817.0,Patient,"I mean it depends, I mean like I don't know a lot of times. You know we'll just go to bed early."
207.0,Provider,Does everybody go to bed at the same time you.
6817.0,Patient,"don't have a choice. And choice in that matter. I mean, sometimes we argue about it when it's an hour to earlier than usual, but when we're all out of control and yelling and screaming and fighting and hollering. You know i've had it at that point, like it's bedtime we're not doing this anymore."
207.0,Provider,and on top of everything else that's going on.
6817.0,Patient,"And that's why I tried to sit them down, and you know. talk to them, you know tell them, you know they I mean just I know I know i'm stressed out with the moving and the packing and. How i'm going to get all that dawn and. The problem is, they don't care. They don't care."
207.0,Provider,"The 17th at 1030 1030. And when we meet, I want to you know i'm going to check in to see you know, have you given more thought to enrolling them back into school, even in a different city or enrolling them back with what would be your challenge in getting them back cool."
6817.0,Patient,"I mean, as far as like getting them back probably wouldn't be any challenge all i'd have to do is enroll them i'm mildly concerns or just. You know just all all the hearsay all the talk with the coven bullshit and how about my you know change things for kids at school or how they might because i'm not i'm my kids won't get the vaccine over my dead body. i'm not they're not getting that so whether or not they try to mandate that or you know I don't know like I said it's just a lot of hearsay you hear your name."
207.0,Provider,"This is the reason why i'm going to say that's called this, though, because. This is the thing you're not the only one who feels that. you're not the only one who is against their children getting vaccinated some people, while they're willing to get the vaccination they're not necessarily jumping for their kids to do it, so that that I that I think is um."
6817.0,Patient,"Why. You know it's more than just you know, giving your kids vaccination at this point to I mean they're. You know if they're if they're going to try to force that to allow people to have certain jobs are no allow children to go to school. they're taking away our rights, so I mean like I said over my dead body is that shitty public school worth vaccinate my kids and basically saying yes i'll do whatever you tell me to all be or yes man it's not it's not I mean let's face it, we all. took them with school is. A kid shutter."
207.0,Provider,"But that's that's a bridge that you will have to cross when it comes, but you know it's kind of like they're mandating certain things but um you know when it comes."
6817.0,Patient,"On to so so many people that have you know quit or lost their jobs because that's what it boiled down to like just in the last month, you know, many people have i've had to resign from their jobs."
207.0,Provider,"But that's a job, this is the thing that's a job down let's just say in the school system if."
6817.0,Patient,You say that's that's some people's livelihoods. You know what is. It is a they're not going to force it on these children once they.
207.0,Provider,But that's a long road ahead honestly that is a long road ahead. Everything goes in phases and that's a long road ahead.
6817.0,Patient,"I don't know I just feel like they're dropping you know dragging this crap out. What it was. In the first place, and now they're just dragging it out as far as they can."
207.0,Provider,"But again, that is a long."
6817.0,Patient,How much they can get people to comply.
207.0,Provider,"And right now, if it is just getting kids to wear the masks and just let them more than most, but when you talk about vaccination that's a long road ahead. That they're not talking about men dating for children to get back it's not a fact they haven't even fully approved for for young children together. They haven't they haven't been fully approved it yet So how are you going to mandate that all children get vaccinated when you haven't been approved from birth to 12."
6817.0,Patient,I don't care.
207.0,Provider,"So that's a long road to hell that's a long road ahead, so I think for you it's staying focused more so on um. I recommend for you is staying focused on what is in front of you what is in front of you is that you are depressed you are very anxious and it is affecting your functioning i'm sure your anxiety or depression is also affecting your arm, you have fibromyalgia right."
6817.0,Patient,"it's like that yeah I have mixed connective tissue. Okay it's all like lupus it's. You know very, very much like lupus and then I have sugar in."
207.0,Provider,and
6817.0,Patient,you're diabetic line line.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have your medical stuff and because of your anxiety and your depression that can affect your your health and so it can put you into spasms and you're having a lot of chronic pain, or what have you. And a lot of. The stress of dealing with the kids and all of that to sit and stay focused on whether or not they're going to approve a vaccine for children it's that's that's a long road."
6817.0,Patient,"And that's been at the back of my mind here lately because i've already know said as much, that once we move, you know, things are going to have to change because I I can't handle this."
207.0,Provider,"And that's what you look at and what you feel once i'm with you, if they start mandating children going i'm getting vaccinated now I don't know I don't have the patience to homeschool nobody, but I might have to devote some patience. i'm gonna have to develop some patients so i'm with you on that, because then you're you're infringing on my rights but that's not your you're presenting problem right now is your health your mental emotional and physical health is that plane. Okay. That, I want to meet with you on the 17th and i'm going to check back in by then i'm guessing that you will be moved by then that's almost a month out."
6817.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,i'm quite a month out.
6817.0,Patient,"And I went to visit by that. I said we'd better be moved by then. Because, as of right now, even though you know i'm not moved in over there, even though they still have you know some things that have to fix holly splitting the bills on both like you know i'm. in charge of pain, the electric there and the electric. Here so."
207.0,Provider,"yeah, so I would say, go ahead i'm re evaluate. Your option and whatever is not pressing. I wouldn't put some because, like you said, the here saying the naysayer and all of that you're i'm making a decision i'm making a decision based on somebody saying something. Unless it is there it's right it's written in black and white, then don't give life to that don't give life to that. You need to reset and recharge and if this is the only option, you have to reset and recharge explore the idea. explore it Okay, because at the end of the day, you have to be competitive, you have to be committed to your overall mental physical and emotional health in order to be the mom you need to be to your five children, because if you continue to fall apart, who is going to be there. If you fall completely apart and you're no used to yourself guess what that gets them family members, get your five children. Simply because you are not taking care of your mental emotional physical health because you're so stressed and you're holding on to it like it's a prized possession, that you are falling apart and nobody's there to help you put it together. Okay, if something is something like hold it i've had quoted myself and my husband has had cold and and let me explain something to you holly. It does not deal with everybody, the same way, how do you get it. Who knows, but somehow some people get it and how it deals with you and you don't want to end up where you got some big Daddy and it deals with you in a sense, with your underlying conditions and it puts you in the hospital. And you're there for a week or two or three who takes care of your five kids when you're you're out of commission. And what can. And what will exacerbate any kind of virus or medical condition is stress stress is one of those silent killers. And you continue saying a stress, as you are because of not just your kids but all of economical stressors family stressors financial stressors you just keep piling up all these stressors eventually, you are not so strong that you will fall apart. Okay. So, look into the situation where he is, and you know it's hard, but it is soliciting assistance to be able to move because moving is just by yourself it's. very stressful and it when it comes on to your kids tell me, it is their responsibility to pack up their stuff and if they don't pack it up and whatever they don't pack up well."
6817.0,Patient,"I go i'm already yeah. Basically, already said as much, I said. The only thing that gets moved, as you know, my stuff in your bed, then so be it."
207.0,Provider,"Is what it is. Oh, I like that."
6817.0,Patient,I think i'd probably be happier. there'd be less than you know what shit.
207.0,Provider,"So. i'll send this one, or there is the more there's to make a mess with i've learned that real quick."
6817.0,Patient,being stuck here and clutter like it's just I want as little as possible.
207.0,Provider,"There you go there you go there, you know all right holly i'll see you tomorrow in group okay. All right, all right bye."
