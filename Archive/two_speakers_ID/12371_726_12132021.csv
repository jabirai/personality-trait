With the group and just opening up in general, with everyone out things that are going on as a happened. So thank you."
12371.0,Patient,"Good tend to be like quiet more quiet on the quiet side you've been with a stake in my personal life and then, just like within groups and stuff. I know I do like 10 other meetings or even like when I was in. It. That a report really rehabilitation program when I was there in person or you know they're in in house was quiet for a while, though, it takes a while for me to open up and get comfortable around people, why do like you know that helps. When I have these just needing to say something, why we feel it's right eight or when the subject. The subject it helps you to relate to other people as well."
726.0,Provider,"You know what's funny it's like when you opened up, I think you help a lot the. The other girl that's in a group to. Because you had opened up about something that that was some something that was happening to her so but, even though you're quiet it's like when you say something it's it's things that matter that you're saying you're not just saying something just. fill in the void so. Mr Steve here um how's everything else going."
12371.0,Patient,"it's okay um. Just a little slow around the holidays, you know just a holiday feeling in. i'm in my family here and everything, but just it's still a little difficult time for me right now to just you know being without my immediate family or you know my my my mom or my my sister. i'm trying to think about too much, but just it's there. You know, helps me, sometimes we just talk about it. Whether whether what i'm going through or just even you know what's bothering me for just for that day."
726.0,Provider,How about your dad is he still around or.
12371.0,Patient,"yeah he is my dad my dad. he's a lot, he was older than my mom my mother, but he only he's a very fluent in our in our Navajo language and not so fluent in English, now I may communicate with them, you know, on a very basic level but. You know you can't really reach out and talk to him, and you know he's back in Arizona and skin up there in age and. Very you know I can't hear 12 the phone so don't delay call to you know talk to him that way but, and I have other relatives that I can talk to reach out to I just I haven't and. it's been about a year you're almost to what about a year year year and a half since I reached out or talk to anybody as far as like my aunties my uncle's or even my my smite my older sister, I have a one over his older sister left. and just been a hard for me to. reach out or talk to, I think that that just been sort of. delaying it putting it off. For, is it not talking about it, no every happened but. it's difficult right now."
726.0,Provider,"First, I was like do you guys to any like anything ceremony that you could something that you could do, on your own to just kind of like I know that some people will put their grief back to the earth or. You know something maybe you don't have to do it with anybody else but maybe something to do for yourself."
12371.0,Patient,"yeah that you know just talking with like being out in nature and talking and just again it's just goes back to. Just putting it off, you know i'm still holding holding on to it won't hold on to it for some some reason, but just needing to still clear that clear that error clear myself from that cleanse myself and putting that off when I was in rehab I was in fresno and it was a native American. Facility there in fresno and it was a help me. You know just talking with other natives and then being around you know just certain ceremonies or just other elders that were there that had other. Experiences what they went through how things, help them. And I just took a hold of that and just. was able to just spend time by myself use some of that what they told what they had talked about, and then use it in my time there to express myself or to deal with certain things. But a lady I haven't. Just. avoided it."
726.0,Provider,for holding on to the memories of them in a way.
12371.0,Patient,"yeah just memories and just sort of how everything had happened, you know it wasn't even like after the after the passing of my mom. Just even the drama that are just some of the arguments that went on in between my immediate family um. So I have a one or the brother and then another sister. I have two older sisters and one brother, but uh the other two my brother and my other sister I just really don't just they're just I don't want them in my life. I just i'm trying to put all that not to hold resentment but it's just it's just too much for me to even think about you know caring about them, or just having that. Having that a animosity or hate or just feelings for them, you know it's too much so just don't want that, in my life. With my older sister, you know she's just she's she's not she doesn't use, you know she's not she's an older sister she's always been. You know she's well educated. You know, has her family she's always been busy with a job. She was In school I think she's getting her doctorate. and I forgot what or no doctor and philosophy, or just going back to school for them, I know she graduated recently. Well, my two other shit or siblings yeah they use. And during my mom's safra my mom's a funeral and just everything just just didn't go. Very well, so."
726.0,Provider,"I mean. And then, because I sounded like you started this whole thing with arm, you said pills right that it was was it avoidant trying to avoid any like pain of the feeling of grief, because it happened so fast, I mean. we're talking about that."
12371.0,Patient,"yeah I think my mind with the pills it it's just something I had been struggling with for quite a while, if I had to actually back in 2009 and I was using it on and off after the accident, for several years and then I had went to treatment Program. For alcohol and I was able to you know eventually stopped myself with the pills, but they picked up alcohol, instead, but I had eventually stopped that got into a program in 2012 and then was clean for about six years, seven years and. Just started back taking pills again, and it was just for my back my back, I was doing a lot of electrical work lot of physical work. So I was having just back then, so I was going to regular doctor taking them as prescribed stuff but eventually just got to the point where I was taking a just to get high. and It wasn't till recently tell about two years ago, when I started having a sister, you know her health problems. And then that's when I started mixing that with alcohol and just drinking a lot more and that's what had led me up into a program the beginning of this year, because I was just drinking as well, and then the other pills roles there and. Just added to it, you know."
