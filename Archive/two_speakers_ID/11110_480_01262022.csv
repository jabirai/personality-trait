Because my dad didn't get it, because. they're just supervised and it's just tough because kindles just not communicating so like. like to see like texting some yoda why you see that Jacob well I didn't even know why would say because I don't know what's going on, so I sent him because he asked me if I didn't notice that, in this she blows up. In your book I can't I can't even say that, like I literally I didn't say anything because I don't want to say anything to make from that and then she'll just cut me off and. You know right like whoa. whoa whoa and so, for every."
480.0,Provider,Like exactly what.
11110.0,Patient,I I literally at the point where I don't know. Why and i'm still.
480.0,Provider,"here. So here's a question for you, you said you got to a point. Where. You don't care you realize like she doesn't care about you, she doesn't love you and you're trying to accept that So do you still have days, where you like want her back want her to care."
11110.0,Patient,"Oh, of course, yeah this because me it's because i've only been one person in my life. I need to get out there, I can't i'm trying to you know I just like I just need to get out. You know, like, I was younger like you know saying like I should have spent my my younger 20s or some shit you know I I don't know you know. yeah. But yeah."
480.0,Provider,"I, but I feel like. If you get your license back that'll help with. Some of that. you'll actually be able to go places and meet people and."
11110.0,Patient,"yeah like me oh you. But yeah I know just saying that you're right though place we meet every day you're totally right yes yeah I just don't I don't you know we're talking about how you attract people that you're like you know saying like. yeah that's the people attract you know it's fucking dope kids you know and shit like that, and this this it's. You know. In order to attract some loving this completely different, but I can't because i'm there on a different scale to me, you know say like i've grown up this way."
480.0,Provider,"So that's the thing like I totally understand what you're saying, but I also would challenge you in that because I think that. it's not that. You can't attract people who are living differently, because that's what happens when you start healing and you start changing your lifestyle, like the better you get at setting boundaries and keeping boundaries with Kendall and being just Nice and short and like whatever. And then you move on with your life, you make healthy choices, then you're going to start attracting healthy people. yeah exactly."
11110.0,Patient,"yeah you're right and then literally like i'm you know I sit and watch like videos like i'll watch YouTube videos this girl named like marnie or whatever, just like to. Not call girl but she's like a wing girl or. Whatever we. saw sit for hours and watch like a you know. How, you should flirt and how you should do is nice to do that. i'm trying i'm trying to get back to where you know. What you're saying you're going to attract the right which you want, you know I just. yeah I got a lot. But yeah it may not be the right time yeah I mean. yeah i'm trying to get her in her, and I wish I wish that I could get older right now, so that I can show you know her to either I can be you know pass this bullshit you know. it's not fair that she's gonna have this whole bone. What holding out for what nothing."
480.0,Provider,Nothing no and that's just that's just that you'll never understand and be able to relate to her decisions because you're somebody who's capable of empathy and compassion and she's not so. It is what it is it's really sad that's the thing it's like there's a lot of. grief involved in it and.
11110.0,Patient,"recognizing that says the. there's a group of people mean her adding Jacob and other people that could spend their life with me and have a life with a good person, but yet they so choose and their life to do different. Right now, and a lot of people do this all if you choose to view mean terrible. If people they're fighting all the time and I, I never understood that I just you know. What people you know she could choose to literally, be a good person, but they're not that so. That you. feel bad you know the. seagull have. You in our lives because man. i'm definitely a. I do every every everything is. On 10% you know I just."
480.0,Provider,"But the thing is somebody like her, will take advantage of that and it'll never be enough, which is why. it's totally like it's sad for her but it's good for you, that you're not with her, because you deserve someone who's not going to take advantage of that and who's going to reciprocate that."
11110.0,Patient,"Like like I was only a stepping stone. Just use me to get to wherever next she was going. yeah it's like you're saying, she made her decisions and I don't know what she's thinking so. yeah i'll never know yeah yeah and I shouldn't even thinking about it anyway, but I do that, but it is, this is the process and grieving getting over you know all this stuff."
480.0,Provider,"In the past, well and it's continuously getting better, which is a good thing and it'll get easier, as. The time goes on."
11110.0,Patient,"Here real bad. we're going to come up with the custody and we're not talking in this it's going to be no better this time it's already know you already know what i'm capable. Right, which is, I know how to be independent and I do it, I just got to get back so once I get back to where we're going to see me here. yeah wow the kids film, but yet they spent all these years, the book The book, what are you know, so you know know like you know, of course. Yes, my life before you know that come twice a week to come, once a week once a month, whatever you don't care because he tall, you are ours, you know. I know how it is you know I can deal with the shipping she takes me like. Like yes like she'll text me like Bam and Diana want to adopt the key which Graham and Diana are. You foster that for every object. I think they like me that I think they care about her. yeah yeah because, if I think, since a. lot of times like you know girls. Look real good and they're all made up and got some hi. Natasha."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
11110.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.

480.0,Provider,No that's actually true and takes them. A long time to take them.

480.0,Provider,"Okay well so just here's my here's my fear with scheduling is I don't want you to forget and because yourself pay, and if you don't show up it's you have to pay for it, so do you want to just wait because i'll see you at group before."
11110.0,Patient,We would have.
