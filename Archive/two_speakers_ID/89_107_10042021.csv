107.0,Provider,Hello. Good. we're in a different spot today.
89.0,Patient,I got a new painting table.
107.0,Provider,Oh Nice.
89.0,Patient,My painting sexually.
107.0,Provider,cool.
89.0,Patient,"Next, little pink."
107.0,Provider,fun. So how's life.
89.0,Patient,"Life is good. This. I mean, I think, things are. You know, things are getting to be like i'm getting to be a little bit more a bit of a routine with addie in school everything."
107.0,Provider,So she was able to start school.
89.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"that's where remember you had to scramble to do the paperwork, but if she was going to start that coming Monday, but we weren't entirely sure that was going to happen."
89.0,Patient,"yeah so I ended up, so I was able to get that done. and enter in that that following Monday. which I was really happy about, because. well overdue, but she she loves the school is amazing like she is the only school, I think, like us, like by the ocean, which is very. Nice yeah when the morning I take her it's kind of hit or miss getting down to the peninsula, so I try to get up there, like as early as I can, because it's only maybe like 1015 minutes away from my apartment but you know if you happen to hit traffic. Then it can be. So we usually get there, you know when there is no traffic will get there, like maybe 2030 minutes or 20 minutes in advance, and then we just take your shoes off and go watch the waves on the beach, which is."
107.0,Provider,Pretty exciting.
89.0,Patient,"he's making like. is funny the first day. of school when I picked her up in the afternoon and I asked her so did you have a good time because I always asked her like every time I pick her up like how was your day on the scale of one to 10 and. She was like Oh, it was amazing right so much fun and tell me, all these positive things it's like okay well that sounds awesome like was there anything he didn't like about. You know the school or the day she's like well yeah mom there was one this one time like this one point in the afternoon, where there were three kids that wanted to play with me and like I just I mean I couldn't I didn't know what to do, like I. can play with all of them, I was just like oh wow you are. So she likes it a lot, I think."
107.0,Provider,These are good problems to have kiddo. awesome yeah.
89.0,Patient,"or a school she struggled let me see tears fine, but like i'm there was not that much positive feedback when she came back she like. there's a lot of things that she didn't like and everything was she was in preschool and like for us so i'm happy to have some you know have her be really enjoying this one. Especially seeing is where I wanted her to go over since we."
107.0,Provider,know. yeah that's exciting so it's been two weeks are being in school now.
89.0,Patient,"yeah yeah she started them. And she's doing well she's got her life little she's got a little like a homework booklet for math and stuff and we do like. Starting anything to turn in but they give it to the parents and when we do it, like every week, we did they send us this was really good about. The teachers really good about sending us like weekly email updates about what they're doing and what they want us to be doing in the booklet at home it's just kind of like so that we can. stay on the same page as the kids and. she's like all about it, you know, every time I see this booklet I want to do some some homework so it's really cool. yeah. But death so. As as was so right now what we're doing because her dad didn't hasn't gotten the place yet in Newport. And he. was so what he's told me now is that he needs to be out of the out of his house in San Diego like his East lease and by the end of this month, like this coming month. So at least that some sort of you know deadline. yeah Okay, and you just you know he's been telling me oh yeah I have some places I just haven't nailed down anything or whatever, and let me it's been nearly a year of that so at least the fact that now, you know can't stay in San Diego is going to help. But. While he's still there i'm keeping her for the four days and he's going to keep just hazard, the three days every week, which is not. i'd rather just have her like all the DS through school but. You know logistically speaking I can't really do that with work. But instead of keeping her until Monday nights and always picking her up either Thursday or Friday I pick her up on Thursdays and then keep her until he picks her up Tuesday after school, so I guess that's five days, five days. So, because otherwise he's carding her back and forth from San Diego to Newport and she has to get up and. walk in the morning, so. sense, so I just told them like or I mean I, we had a conversation about it that, like until he finds a place here, I think it would probably be better that. You know. you're here for as long as I can take her and pick her up. And that was you know if that was that went well and that was fine to say, obviously I think he realizes that. mean I don't think he wants to carve out an hour and a half, every day."
107.0,Provider,Right yeah.
89.0,Patient,"yeah so that's been good, it was one time last week, though, that he called me when I was in the middle, I was in the middle of a lesson because. I wasn't expecting like I was going good good what's up and it's like well. I you know I need to ask you a favor like I I guess so she her pickup time is at 220 every afternoon and he's he calls me at like I think it was maybe 130 by saying that he had slept in like slips through the. I mean I don't know so he's it because it's coming from San Diego so it's like by the timing, but like an hour late or something so I ended up having to. Well, I was it's funny too so so yeah it's fine i'll go pick her up, I was on a I listened to three but."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
89.0,Patient,"yeah so I was going to leave right, then by you know, I was gonna have to take her out of school early, so I can make it back for less than that everything and it's just funny because. Like as I sat in the car and like to me and i'm getting ready to go I realized that like Chris was at the US Doug was work at the time, and he was at the apartment and everything, and so I ended up calling him and he went to pick her up, and it was you know. No problem, because you said. But it's just funny because, like that didn't even you know, I was like oh my way and going, and then it was like wait so that was kind of it was kind of cool. To be able to you know call them up and had to pick it up and. She got happy."
107.0,Provider,Good.
89.0,Patient,"Good. So. good and bad situation all at the same time, I feel like. That you know that was, I mean that from david's and that was to be expected, obviously. my surprise, so that's why you know, looking forward to being a little bit. there's less chance for stuff like that to keep. It. yeah. It was. It is with this. yeah. i'm back to so I used to go when I was in when I first got out of. Like I could when I went to rehab a few years ago, I would go to this meeting in Newport. hold this silver tooth tigers."
107.0,Provider,"Oh, I remember you talking about that meeting, because it is a distinctive name."
89.0,Patient,"Right and so that's the meeting i've been going to pretty regularly. I don't have. I i've been going, but I don't have like. Like a risk, you know, like coffee or whatever like I don't have a responsibility and. yeah i've been going it's kind of cool because it's just like that you know it's my age group and there's you know a lot of people that I well that's why I see, I say that now it's my age group is a little bit younger than age group, because it was like when I. Now, like. Okay yeah."
107.0,Provider,"All right, what. turns out that happens to all of us."
89.0,Patient,"yeah right, I know there's so. Many times i'm just like oh yeah wait. But still, you know. Like it's a little bit younger than me but it's still like. People that I feel like I can relate to a little bit and there's also one in Laguna niguel that I go to that's near my dad's House that when i've only been to. Like once or twice I think it's an hour meeting which I struggle with a little. If sometimes the it. lands like on a Friday, on a Friday evening, which is when I have it, so a keeper at my. butt oh like drop her off my dads are all going on at my dad's and then it's fine. But, like, I know, an hour and a half, and then you end up getting home at like 930. So it's at some time so I don't know that go to that one is that just a little bit tough with her and everything but. Definitely, the one in super Newport works out. With the time and everything so that's been good. notebooks but yeah. that's. yeah."
107.0,Provider,"i'm just how many meetings you saying you've been to now, since we talked."
89.0,Patient,"I mean, maybe like so when we first like when we first got off top because we didn't talk about it last. Time about that. Right, so it took me like a."
107.0,Provider,Good two weeks to.
89.0,Patient,get to a.
107.0,Provider,meeting before.
89.0,Patient,"That or after that and then from there, I went to the silver tooth one like one after those two weeks, I think I went like two weeks in a row, or three weeks in a row. I know I missed you in between them, but i've been trying to go like pretty consistently and then I added because it's close to my dad's and everything like that so. I was in the same week so. i'm just trying to kind of figure out because you got to kind of get in your group, I feel like a meeting where and when they work for you so. i've been trying to. hope that it'll take a minute and. A little bit tough to because, like Chris you know my new boyfriend is not you know when we have a huge conversation about that either I kind of go like one by myself, to which is that's like my next big rock I feel like, then, I need to move like he knows, obviously, but. I don't think you know he's like I haven't like let him in on my. he's not fully aware of, like my plans going forward and. You know. Because like for like a long time, because I used to you know I mean I used to go to a quite a bit when I came out of the rehab and everything, but then it was just kind of you know I kind of just did my thing and is almost like I was. In some ways, you know I asked that's you know, I was a little bit you know, I was kind of freaking out last time. You know, when we talked about getting meeting some extra help because I was forced to for over a year kind of was isolated from everything, and you know just had addy and just had work and had no reason to really be exposed to any of that sort of stuff. And like drinking and or whatever, and you know the whole social aspect of it and I wasn't with anybody, and so it really was. Not an issue but it wasn't you know I wasn't kind of issue, I was just kind of avoiding it and so that's I think that's why it made me really nervous like when we. started to you know talk about it because there's a difference between you know, being in a situation in which you're not exposed to it and actually dealing with it. So. that's you know. Because you know it happens, a lot more now that you know we go because he's like he's super social person everything and he's i'm a little bit more kind of standoffish but he's type of personally. I feel like I told you this, but you know just kind of gets along with everybody, it was always making friends and that kind of makes me a little bit nervous, because sometimes I feel like you know I haven't kind of attack some of those issues. around them for a while, so."
107.0,Provider,"So I thought, our next big issue was going to be talking about immigration, but we should probably talk about recovery and your plan on how to manage that too that's. Why i'm giggling. cuz i'm like oh OK, we didn't we didn't actually have the recovery talk Okay, well, we should probably do both."
89.0,Patient,"Now, and it's like it's good but it's just one of those things where. It just makes me worried because I just you know, should the situation arise, sometimes i'm just like I mean I feel like i've always felt like that, whether I was in recovery, you know, instead of going to air not like right coming right out of rehab there's always that questions. That you know. If somebody throws something in front of you like, I mean, are you really equipped to. not be you know to say no to, and you know there's been situations where I have said no, and that's great except for you know. Every you know some oftentimes I feel like you know you don't gain confidence until you go through those situations and they go positively right and kind of feel better about yourself every time it happens, but I feel like that hasn't happened for me kind of thing like."
107.0,Provider,"Even out of the environment. I mean, it was very environmental free to so."
89.0,Patient,"Well, for sure, but I mean even just now so like since having started started dating Chris like i've been you know we will go to the Hill and everybody's drinking all that stuff and. Like and i've been fine there, except for that doesn't necessarily I feel like it should have given me the confidence to think that, like you know moving forward, it would have been but for some reason I just like feel. Just like I did kind of it step one and I don't know it's like that's normal or not, but."
107.0,Provider,"I think a lot of what you're dealing with it's just kind of facing life in a different way and a lot of it, you were avoiding before, so it could feel kind of shiny and new."
89.0,Patient,"yeah for sure. No absolutely well that yeah that's just that was a scary thing it's just like I just felt like like we you know we talked and everything and we you know i've been in the program but like. I just yeah there's the difference between you know, removing yourself and actually dealing with it."
107.0,Provider,"Yes, kind of white knuckling. taking it on."
89.0,Patient,"it's hard like going back to the meetings like. Sometimes I just asked myself, like me, and you, and you know the sad thing is, you have to, otherwise you don't get through it, but it's, just like the whole program is like it's just exhausting like."
107.0,Provider,"So what stands out to you what is, what are the like top three most exhausting things about it."
89.0,Patient,"Right things. I just mean like you know, having just first of all because I don't want her yet, but you know the oh, you know, do the steps and everything like that, and you know. You know, in the beginning it's fine right because it's all about accountability and like looking at yourself and all that stuff but it's just it's just like a constant and it has to be in that I understand what it's like it's constantly working towards. You know this goal of I don't even know what everybody talks about like that some point, you know it gets better, but like it's just and just having this network of people, and I think that's a big one for me like. I don't know why, but for some reason, like before it wasn't. I look forward to that like and going to meetings and. Being with the you know and meeting with the people that were there and. But now, for some reason I don't I don't know why, but like I I feel like i'm not. Like I can relate to everybody and I like sitting in but like I don't look forward to go into the meetings is like oh yeah this you know you see this person and this person in it. I don't know if i'm explaining it correctly, but."
107.0,Provider,I think that you like to have just a few people in your life that are like your people you're not into having like a crowd of humans.
89.0,Patient,it's and what.
107.0,Provider,"yeah and then before, when you were still married you didn't have good support like. that's a really blatant obvious statement so going to a meeting was. A relief, because these people at least were willing to support some positive decisions that you were trying to make in your life. And so they could kind of stand out as being unique individuals for you, because your day to day experience was so opposite of what you were trying to achieve. But now that your day to day is congruent to what you're trying to achieve there's a part of us probably like Why do I need that and this."
89.0,Patient,"ain't no but I mean that's not a good thing, but but that's spot on."
107.0,Provider,"So the reason why you need both is because you haven't done a fantastic job of integrating recovery into your day to day, because here you been dating for how long eight months."
89.0,Patient,A year 910 months notice yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So you haven't really had much of the recovery talk and his mind you're sober you're not into doing that stuff and it's maybe not even much of an issue, so you haven't really had the talk of. You need to live a life of being in recovery, and that means you should go to meetings or What do you mean what do you think."
89.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I mean I he obviously like he knows that you know I used to drink and I used to you know visual David and I and. When he knows that, like but it's i've always kind of like downplayed it I feel like, and you know i'm not up until recently, I mean he doesn't really I mean I don't even. can't even I don't know yeah I don't think I yeah I don't think i've told him that, like I like explicitly i'm going out to he knows that, like i've called you know i've called with you and I have calls with you know bright heart, but every night, but he never asks really. He does education and I take every morning like and he. Take it. i'm I don't I can't quite put my finger on with yeah I don't know why that is, or I don't mind it like that's."
107.0,Provider,"All it's probably him respecting your privacy and knowing that if you haven't talked about it or brought it up you're not really super comfortable and talking about it. And as long as you seem happy and healthy no harm no foul. But I do think that it's important to kind of have a more involved conversation he doesn't need to know every little nitty gritty detail, but I do think it would be important to acknowledge that this is not just a. matter of a life choice, this is a matter of you need to do this or you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble choice."
89.0,Patient,yeah exactly it's yeah. The magnitude is a little bit bigger I feel like it. yeah so that's. Let me add obvious. That yeah this.
107.0,Provider,"is so I almost feel like it's an interesting timing, that this comes up now, when my thought process was okay we're going to check in on how things are going with matty school and then we're going to talk about. how things are going in terms of the immigration plan slash. conversation and Lo and behold there's another serious conversation we could have instead and why does that not surprise me. So it seems like you're avoiding the immigration conversation by kind of being like hey. let's have this conversation, and I agree with you that you should have that conversation, but I think that if I had to choose i'm going to choose the immigration conversation. And then the recovery conversation, or maybe you just you know go ahead and rip the both band aids off at the same time. yeah but either way. These things need to, we need to shift gears because now david's david's you can't really control him at Madison school, things are moving along you're getting into a routine all of that is great you're going to some meetings gay keep all that up and now."
89.0,Patient,"I mean. I feel like i've been i've looked into it and I keep looking into it and every time I do just like more terrifying because it's just it's a long and complicated process but. I fear I mean. Every time I feel like every time it kind of gets run up it's like yeah of course they'd like we're going to figure it out it's going to be fine today and, like I. I need to push the issue a little bit more than that because. And then there's like yeah."
107.0,Provider,"Maybe he needs to sit down and do the research with you. But yeah as you look at it together, you can see it's not just a matter of you know, yes, it will be fine but it's it's an involved process."
89.0,Patient,"For sure, and I mean I G and it's funny because he's the one who actually brought it up to me in the first place, like because. In the beginning, you know, and I was worried about all this other stuff we talked about it, but I haven't really looked into it, a whole lot and he was the word and told me like. you realize that this is like you know i've looked i've started to look into this and this is like a big deal like this is not an easy process like that, and so that's what kind of prompted me to start but I don't know if, like. I don't know that feels like the gears of kind of switched or what but, and I know that I know that there's some I think the issue is going to be like. I know for him, like because he has a family out here that, like it is. That he takes care about here, and everything I think we talked about that a little bit, but. And they're not super keen on him leaving, and I think that's that's hard for him and that's not something you know and like we talked about in the beginning, I think it really is good, I was. Hoping that it wasn't that always like you know prepare for the worst and expect the best or whatever, but. I think it's going to end up coming down to the fact that, like, I might have to leave and he's gonna have to join me like we talked about. Because he he keeps saying that like yeah we're gonna leave together and everything's gonna be fine except for then like nothing's kind of there's just feel like it just."
107.0,Provider,keeps getting pushed off a little bit.
89.0,Patient,"yeah but it's just like you know there's things that we have to do and have to get done and if it's always just like oh yeah, of course, but then it never. happens and it's a little bit of an uncomfortable situation and I don't necessarily want to push the issue, so I don't but it's going to get to a point now where it's yeah no it's gonna have to be like. You know I get all the stuff that you have to take care of but you know, this is the timeline that I have and. And we even like that even came up at one point to that like you know he's he says, like there's some stuff that I need to take care of and I don't feel like we're on the same. And he's like but that's going to be okay, like, I mean if you have to stay there, like a gift to go a little bit earlier than I do, and. You know, and then I can meet us and so be it, and it'll be fine, but you know I almost actually like that was my fault like I almost you know not played it off like you know, was it like that I was disappointed that you know, like. But you know, deep down, I know that that might be the logical solution and it'll be fine it's just like."
107.0,Provider,"Your heads not going to pop off, you know. I lay down or put some sort of belt on it."
89.0,Patient,yeah. I think i've been worse so obviously.
107.0,Provider,"You will be alright, but I think it's time to sit down with him and go through it together and create a plan. And then, while you're there you're going to be, by the way, here's my weekly schedule that includes some meetings."
89.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And here are the things that I need to do, and this is how I need to spend my time to keep me on the straight and narrow and legal."
89.0,Patient,"yeah no that's exactly it to there's like a lot at stake there so. I mean there always has been, but you know right. yeah no no you're right."
107.0,Provider,"I mean i'm pretty sure you can come up with something else, so we can talk about, but I. feel like these are the most important things at this point."
89.0,Patient,yeah definitely. Like a good plan moving forward or.
107.0,Provider,"When is the next time you guys are going to visit worry because he doesn't you don't have next to each other right he's up in Montana, or something."
89.0,Patient,"yeah so he's been he's been staying actually like more than he used to I mean he's like there may be like one or two days during the week that he doesn't but. Other than that he's usually here he's actually going to be home for the next two days, because he has to get some stuff done with his family, but I think probably next time I see him is going to be like Wednesday or Thursday so. i'll have a little bit of time to kind of wrap my head around it and talk to him."
107.0,Provider,"But you know you don't need to understand it, you just need to do it. I know it was just here to talk yourself out of it and. You just need to have enough time like don't do it before you have to leave 10 minutes to go the barn."
89.0,Patient,You.
107.0,Provider,"Take it to school right, you need to do it when you can hang out. and pull up the website or websites or whatever, and start looking at the process, while having the conversation."
89.0,Patient,yeah it's almost like last time right like texted him on my way home because I just needed to I. needed to open up the conversation psyching myself. But yeah for sure I will try not to talk myself out of it and set it up in it.
107.0,Provider,"Well then, you're going to send me a text. And you're going to tell me that you started the conversation."
89.0,Patient,"Okay, Sarah."
107.0,Provider,"And then. You know you're not going to just start it walk away from it like you're going to this conversation means you're going to actually like hey I need to have you help me. Look at this together, and we need to start wrapping your head around what this is really going to look like. Because it's overwhelming. Understandably, and you need help kind of working through it just logically even talking through it i'm sure just you know it's a lot of details and just having some a to talk through like you both read it, and then talk through like okay here's what I understand this to be."
89.0,Patient,"that'd be good, I feel like that makes me feel better."
107.0,Provider,"That you're doing it together he's open to the idea it's not like you're introducing the whole topic to him you're now taking it to the next level of now what like I think we had talked about the timing for you was next may potentially. yeah May, June."
89.0,Patient,So that's yeah.
107.0,Provider,I mean.
89.0,Patient,Everything that's you know the whole lot of time to get together so.
107.0,Provider,"Well, whether there's time or not the whole point is to get away from the scrambling last minute asked minute stuff that has continued to happen to let's create a plan. let's create a way that's actually look house it's going to lay out how are you going to talk to about what you know you're going to have to let go of various positions and plan for that the horse community is small, so you want to make sure that's positive transition."
89.0,Patient,"Sure, now that given some thought to as well. it's not going to be easy, but it's going to be doable I think like you said you know we have in a positive way."
107.0,Provider,"Even if people have negative reactions, they can work around it and manage it if it's not something that has to happen yesterday."
89.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no you're right, the sooner the better, when it comes to that kind of stuff."
107.0,Provider,"On some level right not you know for years ahead of time, but now is the time to start really intentionally creating a plan."
89.0,Patient,not leaving anybody kind of in a situation. So much fun.
107.0,Provider,"So, what are you planning on doing with your art, are you just using are you reusing campuses are you making different ones."
89.0,Patient,"So this this canvas I actually got from one of like somebody that we met one of our buddies now that lives in the complex here and he's like a real estate agent. and We kind of just hit it off, and he, like he came to the apartment and everything and he liked all the steps that I was doing and so he had bought like I guess his brothers, also an artist and he had bought several like big big canvases which are really expensive. yeah it will we're just hanging out he's like well look, I have this huge glass table at my dad's House and you know I need to get rid of it like would you make me a painting and i'll trade it for this big glass table and that was just like. Free canvas for a new painting new glass a look."
107.0,Provider,that's yeah.
89.0,Patient,that's pretty cool.
107.0,Provider,"Well, good."
89.0,Patient,"So yes, this is a new canvas."
107.0,Provider,So did he specify what he wanted the subject to be for the painting or.
89.0,Patient,"yeah a little bit like you wanted it, so I have a big mural in my room, which is just kind of funny too, because it was like the first one, I ever did, and I really like it like to my room and I like it, and everything, but like is. By far not like, for me, anyway, not some of the better stuff that i've done but. it's cool so now I get to make like a new and improved version of it, but just. yeah."
107.0,Provider,it's kind of head. Oh wow neat.
89.0,Patient,Some sounds.
107.0,Provider,Good.
