9340.0,Patient,"um it's just like really violent just kind of like apathy, I guess, like it Oh, it would be great if this car hit me right now and it just like praying to God like i'm not even religious it's just like i'm just praying to God that something bad will happen to me."
705.0,Provider,Okay. i'm glad because you're not driving any. Any more your home now right. yeah okay good That was my concern is a lot of times that if you are filling out way that the driving could could even increase those thoughts with your home safe.

9340.0,Patient,You live by yourself. No i'm.
705.0,Provider,just trying to see you know even today how to support you hootie having your support network.
9340.0,Patient,"I guess friends and stuff but like. So. I think I borderline i've been diagnosed and when the diagnosis, but taken away I kind of just keeping it there just for simplicity. So I feel like with that context I one of my symptoms it's like once someone says something wrong and i'm like really upset already I will probably not want to talk to so that's what happened with my friend so. So i'm worried that like. My bunny and so he he has a lot of trouble like hopping around and and I had a nightmare last night that he was like about to die, and I, I felt like we needed to go to like the emergency room for him um. But then, like, I think he passed away, while I was like trying to drive there. So yeah and then I woke up and then I went into his room and I saw that he did something that wasn't normal like normally would find him like standing up right. And I think i'm thinking it's because, like he has trouble getting back up and that's why he doesn't like down anymore, so I saw him laying down once I came in. Just like on the floor and. yeah he he wanted to get up, but he couldn't so. yeah right now. I mean he's doing all right he's he's. Trying to hop around. But yeah anyway, so I was talking to my friend about it, like oh no what should I do because I was thinking of going to the vet but then I was like whoa with the vet just tell me like. it's just say, the best thing to do is to euthanize them, which is not something I want to hear so it's like I do not want to go to the vet just to be just to pay like $40 for a fee and just to be told that, like Okay, you could just say you're not being hopeful. And that would you know that will make it for the time that I lost wasting it on you so. Anyway, I was telling my friend, I was like. yeah I have like this slight paranoia when it comes to that where it's like every time I hear like a pet not doing well, like my friends. They always like suggest to euthanize them, and it makes me believe that they do something to make them more sick. So, so we were forced to euthanize them it that's probably not the case, I kind of rationalized it in my head where it's like I would rather think that the vets are lying rather than believing that my pet is beyond saving. yeah and because of that, like denial it's like I don't want to bring him to the vet to hear those words. yeah I want a solution, I want. To believe that he can be helped, but anyway yeah so basically my friends that was so kind of dumb I should like not worry about it too much, I was already in a bad mood, so I was like i'm just gonna ignore it so basically um. So I was like well my rule is like if my pet is still like able to eat and enjoy his treats then like he he still has a will to live. yeah and if he's not eating he's not like eating is treats then like I think that's time for him to go licensing that. And so I told her that's how I feel and then she said well she's he's probably not enjoying. It all that much with the paint and like okay asshole like first of all i'm already in a very unstable mood like you did not have to say that that was very unnecessary of you. But I am not gonna waste my energy trying to snap on somebody, so I will not. She probably didn't even mean it that way, I just like upset so so I just let it go it's like yeah I was like you know Okay, whatever you just said something that rubbed me the wrong way, but like. You know my problem I don't care so anyway, so I went to class or tried to and I, like my school they take your temperature and every time I get my temperature check they're like i'm always to ward and i've been vaccinated and I have not been sick for a while. But anyway, yeah they they sent me home. And i'm not. i'm not mad that's the thing i'm not mad at the person that took my temperature told me to go home, I could tell she didn't want to and. and it's just like a waste of my time it's like Why did I come here, in the first place, why did I get vaccinated like, why are you testing my temperature, even though this is happening, like every time I come here. Like i'm not sick just i'm not sick and it doesn't it can't be sick it's just like I don't have any symptoms and even even if i'm asymptomatic it's like I don't know like. I don't know I think I was just like really upset with like. The possibility of my rabbit passing away um that or like I would be forced to like no I know they can't force to me but it's like. yeah like it feels like i'm being forced to like euthanized like i'm already struggling with that i'm like I have like a ton of homework that I have to do, which doesn't feel important right now, but I have to do it because, like it's exams week I guess. And, just like this happening is it's like the last straw on the camel's back if. it's just kind of like, although I understand her position and i'm not really mad at her i'm at the school for implementing such like a stupid. Like thing to this, I don't know it's a very stupid process like I do all of this, I do the questionnaire I fill it out, I fill out and say like no I don't experience the symptoms and. The only thing that's bothering me from blue going to class is just like my temperature it's hot it's hot outside of California. So anyway i'm a little upset that they're wasting my class time like yeah like i'm paying you. Like you know and apparently we didn't do much in class today, but even still I went to class I drove those 15 minutes to class. And the only reason why I can get in was because of a high temperature Okay, I get it everyone safety and all that, but that that fear is so unfounded because I haven't been sick for like. Since the pandemic even started ever since I started staying home and shit it's like I just haven't felt sick. yeah. yeah it's like. I guess the feeling is to is accusing me of something that like I like maybe i'm not 100% sure that i'm not sick and they don't want to take that chance, but also like. I don't know it feels like that thing where like sometimes kids would try to get out of school when they were younger and they like put a hair dryer to the head to like raise their temperature it feels like that that was. what was happening like I feel like a lot of people could trick like a thermometer. Okay, and. I guess I just feel upset because my time was wasted and it's like i'm already worried about my like rotten dying rabbit feel like I should have came at all you wasted my time. So yeah I was just really upset that like i'm just trying to go to class and trying to do the things i'm supposed to be doing and I can't because of like this procedure, you know this process. So it's making me very upset but the only reason why i'm not like. Like to intent on dying is because, like well in the future i'm going to see like my favorite band, and also, I want to get back to like. A teacher that I haven't messaged in a while so and we're getting back in touch and I just i'm like well I do want to get back to him, so I won't die until like I email my response and until I get to that concert I guess it, which is in like November so. i'm not sure everyone know them it's called I don't know how but they found me please. is stepping on my keyboard."
705.0,Provider,Is cute.
9340.0,Patient,yeah I have a zoo at my house. My God.
705.0,Provider,"That is your rabbit seeing what's your rabbits name. Napoleon. Napoleon that's sweet so is this, you know I. I understand that part of. The procedure at. Your school, it seemed like that was like you said, the icing on the cake and kind of was like Okay, so you did the right thing i'm glad you called. And then you have this dream is what i'm hearing and then your concern. may or may not be okay."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah and like hidden like just laying down is this kind of like oh that dream just came true, oh no."
705.0,Provider,"yeah but, before this is this what Napoleon does anyway."
9340.0,Patient,"The laying down no but just standing up straight, just like trying to stay up right that that's what's been happening for the past couple months. And like before the thing that's like making me like extremely fearful is that his brother passed away, and I think I have a lot of strong feelings about it. yeah so I guess. I think. I think like. I think three days before his death I didn't really check up on him I didn't visit him and sometimes. I guess, sometimes I want to reflect. Because I did check up on him like was there anything that I could have done to prevent. It from happening, I guess, like. Like I don't know and it wasn't that I was trying to ignore him right things is that good foot really depressed at the time and. I don't know it's just every day. I see his brother still alive. And I think that his brother should be to me, could you wonder if I did something wrong. And I know I can't change the past but. There isn't any closure for me, I guess, like if it is or isn't my fault, I guess it doesn't matter, I guess, I just want to know if I. Did enough."
705.0,Provider,"What i'm hearing you say even about. Napoleon is just like if he's still eating if he's able, you know. That you're you're kidding you're very responsible for your pets it's unfortunate to lose a pet and I, I know I mean I know my cats are like my family. And so, when you lose one it's really hard and that's normal to have that filling up is there anything I could have or would have done, you know differently. or she was. Still there."
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"But this this has, you know no fault of your own it sounds like that something just natural probably happened and. What was napoleon's brother's name. lc oh i'll. Go i'll see probably had some things that maybe we're going on, that you weren't aware."
9340.0,Patient,yeah I know it's harder to find out and rabbits because their prey animal so they have to act like there okay.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, you're absolutely. Correct on that. So, how would you know if they're present That way, there would be no indication for you that it was in distress."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I was worried because before he had. Some mild spaces problems. So sometimes it just means like blockage in the intestines. So I was worried that maybe like he hasn't been eating all day and I just didn't catch that, in time, but my mom told me the day that he passed away, he was eating fine so. She kind of suspects, as a heart attack."
705.0,Provider,"And that could accumulate in each time and it is hard as it may be, it wouldn't matter if you were there or not I know you want to be there. Maybe maybe. Is it i'll pay was probably late, you know knew it was time and wanted to just go and."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I think. Something that my friend, told me that makes me feel a little better, is that he didn't die alone, he died surrounded by family. With this other friends and family."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely. And how lucky was to have you as the character maker, and you know number one. Please support. Napoleon to I know you're you're looking at him he seems like he's okay."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I think he has a hard time hopping around it like this, I got a hardwood floor oh yeah, it is a hardwood floor but. it's not a blanket right now, so he has better traction so I can hop around which makes me feel like. he's doing at least a little better."
705.0,Provider,"And that's you know to his his animals, especially sometimes you know with funding or I have a cat Oh, he had decided."
9340.0,Patient,In who's this she has your name is Valerie.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness. Oh, she just came out of nowhere demanding your attention she must build that you need some extra tlc."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I think so, too, because early I was crying and she came over and she taught me and I, you know I don't believe that animals good actually like understand human emotion, I guess."
705.0,Provider,yeah I know.
9340.0,Patient,yeah so it's a big surprise to be that she understood.
705.0,Provider,"But definitely the connection there, and you know after sometimes. it's hard to. know the difference when you wake up with a dream like that, and then you see Napoleon and then you're wondering Is this still part of the dream or is. This just me being protective over Napoleon."
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And, especially because you've had."
9340.0,Patient,ellison may so.
705.0,Provider,fairly recent.
9340.0,Patient,yeah five months ago now.
705.0,Provider,Do you celebrate in a way.
9340.0,Patient,"I used to like. Go to his grave and just give them flowers, but nowadays I kind of don't go there, because I feel. I just don't want to remember essentially. And I know that must be like a little selfish on my part, but it's like. I feel like i'm haunted by dreams of them. He got himself up. yeah, but I feel like i'm haunted with. i'm haunted by dreams and in my dream, sometimes I would see him, and as I would get closer it's like my brain subconsciously remembers oh he's not here anymore. And then, as I look closer I try to touch him he transforms into another bunny and it feels like Oh, this was the wrong bunny all along with him. So that would happen, a lot in dreams in one of them. I try to pet him, but then he started like melting so it's like and, recently, I had a dream, where. So the bunnies have their own group into the laundry room. And in this dream, so are in in real life, I have only three rabbits now, and so, when I went to that room, I was expecting to see those three but I saw only alfie. And it looked really buried and lonely I guess. So it. It feels kind of dumb because I don't know anyone that would understand like. How Adam taking it because I feel like the people closest to me. know just be like Oh well, i've experienced like a human death so like how good like a buddy mean this much to me to you. I just i'm not in this state to hear that. I don't think that that sounds you know."
705.0,Provider,"When we use the word that you know, maybe it's gone and it's like not at all. I I think there's different we have is is different personalities, we also have our preferences of if we love animals or not he has it i'm i'm a pet lover I don't care if it's a bird or. You know anything like that it's. Just me sometimes if you are that way it's getting to know to with your dreams is. Having that next day when you're waking up and you're distressed from the dream is how to ground yourself and get yourself back to Okay, that was a. dream now you know i'm in my room, this is today Napoleon is here."
9340.0,Patient,"He is, but he just stood up."
705.0,Provider,"You know it's the change of the weather, too, and sometimes animals good enough now maybe you know slight arthritis or something like that to where dylan at sometimes with the change of weather, just like people. To Napoleon is up a little bit better so that's."
9340.0,Patient,"I suspect it for a while, yes, just like condition and rabbits called splay leg where the muscles in this. In this like legs like get weaker over time so that's why he kind of like he can't stand up straight, even though I say that he just like his feet, just like well. You got it."
705.0,Provider,Oh. This. Is adorable. Oh.
9340.0,Patient,"Here we go. So yeah I think he has splay like. My friend who had a rabbit before. she thinks that it might be arthritis. But she says she's she thinks it might not be arthritis if, like his hind legs are fine, but I think he if he can't bring himself up maybe like. here's have something working too well, either. So."
705.0,Provider,"Could it be though that it's not been like a life or death situation is just Napoleon is in some pain, but not. In like a great pain."
9340.0,Patient,"I want that to be a possibility, because, like honestly. I thought that the bunny that will go first was the whole period because he's had this like problem for a while, so what else he passed away was like a huge surprise to me. Because you know sorry I probably should be talking about Napoleon in the room, but um. yeah I thought that he would be the first to pass because he had all of these medical issues and I was like oh. i'm worried. But yeah maybe i'm hoping that i'm going to vet tomorrow. So he better stay wells until then i'm hoping, they can like at least give us pain medicine for him or anything just. To have."
705.0,Provider,To give them some relief and to to to have a second pair of eyes were to. evaluate that napoleon's being okay and.
9340.0,Patient,yeah yes.
705.0,Provider,"What do you usually do too late, with the situation with your friend, where there was a lack of understanding it sounds. Like, how do you usually they do you let it go and then in a time revisited."
9340.0,Patient,"Sometimes, I think, like, for me, whenever I take stuff badly, I tried to like isolate myself so like because I go to this day, where i'm like huh everyone sucks about. So yeah it's just like a period where yeah."
705.0,Provider,You.
9340.0,Patient,come up for a safety plan.
705.0,Provider,Where you list like your warning signs and coping strategies.
9340.0,Patient,"and I yeah i've done a safety plan before I think he, like for warning signs it's hard to say because they're usually triggered by something um, I guess, because I think it's very prominent like when they have these thoughts it's usually like if something. makes me like really upset. them, then I started thinking, I think it would be great to like die right now, like it, it is time for me. he's not moving. you're worried. That boy. My name is he says Christie as he's hopping around. Never might be is there, we go okay so. He got back up. So that's a good warning sign, because these are just things that you can you know be mindful of so sometimes it's like you really."
705.0,Provider,said. To a warning sign that. Maybe after dream.
9340.0,Patient,"After dream. I think for me answer your dream I just feel like very anxious, but I don't feel like suicidal."
705.0,Provider,Okay i'm glad that you know the difference in this as part of your self awareness and sometimes it can be odd temperatures mood situation behavior that a crisis may be developed.
9340.0,Patient,"But yeah I think like. Also. This is a relatively new diagnosis, but when I visited my neuro psychologists, she said that I had OCD so. I mean I started noticing like lately like. After alfie has passed away, I guess, or maybe even before that, just to make sure everyone's Okay, I would just like like like periodically and like. it's supposedly normal it's just not like supposedly it's just like to me it's just not normal, because now I just every chance, I can I just check I just check and. It doesn't make me feel any better, to be honest it's just just like makes me feel like I have some kind of control over I don't know. It may be a part of it also is just to like confirm like napoleon's well being like Oh, is he still there Okay, he is is he not there and well Now I know. So it's just constantly. Just checking."
705.0,Provider,"Is isolation, a warning sign for you. If you're you know, like you'd said earlier that sometimes we like that maybe you isolate."
9340.0,Patient,yeah maybe.
705.0,Provider,"I know this is a question that not a lot of time comes up i'll give you, you know, sometimes a person may say to if I have a hard time getting out of bed that maybe they know. They."
9340.0,Patient,"feel like it's hard to get a bed like almost every day so. I don't know if I feel suicidal, then this is kind of like I don't feel motivated to do anything."
705.0,Provider,Not motivated and definitely be like the start of it.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah. I think, for me, like. My baseline like how I am normally it's just like very unstable and it just takes like one thing to just like take me off, or just like. yeah it's just maybe it's like other things too, but I don't notice them it's like Oh, I have schoolwork it's okay i'm stressed, but like even though i'm stressed, even though i'm stressed it's. it's still manageable and then some just something minor happens it's like okay that's it and then the pot boils over so it's like it's definitely just like one thing. That can trigger it like maybe i'm having a good day and then like so we just said something i'm just like wow I hate everybody. Or, just like I said before, oh, I have a lot of stuff to do but it's Okay, I can manage it oh this happened oh man so it's a combination of both it can be random. Or it can be like the last straw."
705.0,Provider,"What would you say then with internal coping skills, like any type of strategies to take your mind off of it. relaxation techniques or physical."
9340.0,Patient,"Like for me, I try to start like. Describing things, I guess, just like around me like colors or like feeling or I just listened to music. or. Just visit. The rabbits. I think like lately. Like with school. Like i've been doing well, but like kind of at a cost to myself, I guess. So lately school has not been doing so well."
705.0,Provider,"That adds to it, then when school wasn't going well."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah. school. I think what stresses me out the most is mostly like physics. yeah there's just like a lot of stuff that I have to do and i'm worried that. Like. it's just like a lot of work like now, I have for my political science, I need to do this exam where write an essay. And like. I think, for me, I overcomplicate things and I just doubt my own ability to do things so when they ask any question that's like relatively like. You have to put thought into it, I feel scared and I have this course paper and social psychology we just literally about like how the power of the situation affected. The guards and the prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment it's easy it's not easy it's just like it just requires thought and effort for me it's kind of like I get so scared that. I can't do it or i'm going to be found out as like an imposter so that i'm like oh I can't do it, and that in the end I do I do usually because pressure time pressure, but, at the beginning of like oh i'm worried because all these like complicated stuff. Like for political science they're asking like how the debate over the coven 19 mandates tell us about the state of our democracy, currently and it's like I don't know. When I think about it yeah i'll probably know, but like i'm like oh I don't know those are a lot of complicated words it's just like that, essentially, it just feels complicated because they use complicated words and the stakes are high don't when really i'm sure it's a easy."
705.0,Provider,"I think, to with anything if you're trying to learn about it and you may have that self doubt, but like you were. saying, in the end you pull it off, you make it happen, and hopefully learning that by bit to gain more self confidence that you know why it's okay to have that period of time where you're trying to work it out and trying to see how you feel about maybe you know different. Do you have any people or social settings that provide distractions when you're feeling suicidal."
9340.0,Patient,"I just kind of go find like a crisis. Whether it's here like the text I just I do not rely on my social circle all that much because well trying to. Like i'm trying to make that effort, but like normally I don't rely on them, because I feel like it's too serious and they wouldn't. it's not that they wouldn't get it it's just kind of like a worried about stressing them out. yeah but i've been at before sorry what."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I was just gonna say to you know, sometimes that's that's where you're like, with your friends and you don't want to stress them out, but like you were saying you're reaching out. To the different you know crisis counselors which is great, can you distract yourself to like is there even if you go outside or maybe meet somebody you don't tell them. You know, maybe what's going on, but you meet them for coffee or something."
9340.0,Patient,"I think for distractions I just usually play like some game involving like me using my mind like sudoku where you have to like see if the numbers add up, for if I play like a rhythm game. Like I have to be like just fully focused on the game away from my emotions."
705.0,Provider,Good one.
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,i'm sorry go ahead.
9340.0,Patient,"No, no, I was just gonna say that or I just like practice songs like a 16 and learning the lessons. You."
705.0,Provider,have really good coping skills and even the one where you were describing things I mean that's a grounding.
9340.0,Patient,technique that's.
705.0,Provider,Great that you already know that hey these are some things that I can. utilize and when I need to.
9340.0,Patient,We have a.
705.0,Provider,In the event that let's say that you feel like the do need to ask for help you have. Three people that you could go to.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean. Like I can go to them, but to I want to it's like."
705.0,Provider,"People like you know someone that you just feel like he didn't need help, even though maybe you didn't have to tell them like everything that was going on, but you feel like that they could assist you."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah yeah my friends or like. I guess Maybe my family, but I think in general and, like someone that doesn't really talk about this to friends, I used to just talk about it to like a therapist or something so I see okay."
705.0,Provider,Good tools to this is extra that I I just I put it on the sheet like in your family would your mom be someone that maybe you could go to even though you might want to just have.
9340.0,Patient,Like yeah I could tell her things I guess.
705.0,Provider,For a couple of names of friends that at least you could get on the phone to construct.
9340.0,Patient,I feel like my friends are like either too busy or they're going through too much stuff right now so. buddy I would rather stick to my so.
705.0,Provider,"mom is one, though, that you could like you were saying you know just a little bit any other."
9340.0,Patient,Maybe. But they're they're either too busy or they might not understand. It.
705.0,Provider,"or help, not even understanding just you know hey I just. Like I need you to come over or I need to talk to you, you have any body beside your mom that that you can talk to you like that."
9340.0,Patient,Well yeah I have some friends that I could talk to it's just like i'd rather not talk to them.
705.0,Provider,"On on matt areas into because what I do is after we end the call is go ahead and type this up and i'll send it to your email that we have, I will put on their family or friends and if."
9340.0,Patient,You.
705.0,Provider,can think of any names that's great. Even if it's not like okay i'm going to call them and tell them what's going on. As someone. To just distract.
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Can you tell me two things that you can do to keep your environments thing.
9340.0,Patient,"I don't know it's just like. Like for me if I were to die, I would want it, like in a very painless way. So I. I would want a gun, but of course i'm not allowed to have one. made like he say there yet or never I know I could never trust myself with a gun, but I might like I don't know what what changed my mind I think guns are cool and then we'll buy it and i'm gonna be like, I want to kill myself and blake like Bam you know. So that's like it, maybe another could be like a car accident, but it has to be a very hardcore accident I don't want to like you know still be alive, I want. Like I just want to die immediately or I could drown, I think, like most peaceful times is when I drowned so every time i'm drown it always felt like a dream so i'm like, if I were to die would probably jump in a pool and just breathe in water. So if I were to or down a bunch of sleeping pills I don't know why either way. I need my medication so it's not like it'd be a bad idea to take it away from me. And I don't want to force my parents so like gives me the medicine, when I need it because you know. I take it one. Not like whenever whenever just like I like from. It could be 9pm I could take it at 5am I don't know but i'll take that as a sleeping pill eventually."
705.0,Provider,Make your environment say would be then probably not to have weapons in your household.
9340.0,Patient,"Probably I mean. I don't know anything that could kill me instantly probably should not be around me right now anything that's painless. Like I would not drink cleaning agents like that sounds like it would suck a lot, it would burn my throat and I like singing so i'm like it's either I stay alive and i'm able to do the stuff that i'm normally able to do or die instantly."
705.0,Provider,And you bet it's only been a. couple of reasons why you feel like life is worth living.
9340.0,Patient,"And I enjoy singing and it'd be a terrible thing it's like I die, and like. The animals around my neighborhood like i'm friends with like all the neighborhood cats outside and. With Napoleon to it feels like even though, like my parents like they clean up the litter box in the feed him, sometimes for me, I feel like. I fulfill the more emotional part and also just like I buy food and i'm more like. focused on like doing this stuff is that, like the stuff my parents like don't have the time to do so, it would suck if I were to die and Napoleon doesn't know why or where I am. So, if anything like I should be the one to bury him and not the other way around."
705.0,Provider,That is ours on stability to all your animals. Definitely right.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah that is not ideal and and I guess also is this kind of like the pain, I would cause. My friends, I guess, assuming they, like me, which they seem to I do not want to cause them pain, so I don't have three reasons why I enjoy living there, mainly obligations but it's just like."
705.0,Provider,obligations are are you know great I think sometimes we need something to hang on. To and then you mentioned earlier to wanting to attend a concert.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah and just like I have stuff to complete with school like as much as I hate school, I have to do it because I know it's going to like pay off for the future, you know, and I say that, but like honestly once I get my degree it's up to someone to hire me right. But even then I will still keep working hard, even if, at the end, like my efforts are wasted because what else could I do now like, I would rather go to college that work is what i'm saying so it's like, no matter what. I do want to work towards that future where i'm able to own my own house and like have a bunny or whatever I feel like bunnies are great fit for me other animals, I like I, like you, if you're owned by somebody else but like if you're with me all the time I get too overwhelmed. So yeah, and so I want to work towards that future."
705.0,Provider,Future you have life goals you have a lot ahead of you.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah and like I said before, all these life goals is stuff like right now I feel a certain way, like, I feel like these are important to me, maybe later on the might feel like unimportant. and I think, for me, the thing that will mostly stay the same throughout is like, if I were to die, I would have to die immediately there can't be any like. Like if they're kept me you failed attempts any failed attempts that would hinder me from doing like regular stuff living like. I like singing it can affect my voice and I like I enjoy having legs and hands, they can't do anything like I would like to have like my body, if I were alive, but if I want to die I should die email. So yeah that is pretty much what I think i'm really strict and how I want to die like I don't want anyone to kill me, I want to kill myself like ideal. Or, if I were to die very painless so that is also maybe a reason why i'm not dying, yet I just have very strict rules and how I want to die I can't control it, of course, but. This like if I do kill myself."
705.0,Provider,"Today, when you talk about you know feeling like you want to farm yourself, are you thinking of a way where today."
9340.0,Patient,"No i'm thinking like in the future, after I leave and go to a concert like my feelings could change, I mean I feel great afterwards, so I won't or I might feel okay or not Okay, it may man, I might not feel okay. And I just might do something I don't know but that's my limit my time limit, I guess, so it's kind of like I will not die until that. And of course I can't control when I die, but I can control when I kill myself So that is my goal for now to keep looping until at the concert date and away change my mind, I will probably I don't know I will probably try and talk it out with somebody."
705.0,Provider,"Because that's exactly what I was hoping, you would say, because at this point, you know i'm not hearing that you have a plan or an intent, I hear that you know what if I if I do feel that way, I know, numbers, I can all you probably already have the 741741 yes, I love that the."
9340.0,Patient,"Yes, my favorite it's an easy number two i'm like okay now I don't need to memorize anything complicated."
705.0,Provider,And then also to just in case you wanted to talk to somebody you know the 988 IV called ever that's the suicide hotline that you don't have to call the one 800 number Now you can just.
9340.0,Patient,Call 9880 I didn't. know.
705.0,Provider,"it's all in there, where you have it."
9340.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"98 is for the Suicide Prevention hotline and there 24 seven and then you already utilize which is awesome the crisis text line. And that's 24 seven and then Brian park health is also and that's the one 808 nine to 2695. Or you can go to the virtual spinner like we do I, like you did today."
9340.0,Patient,ya.
705.0,Provider,"know and what we want to do too is not have you were you're sitting and you're thinking about it and then things build up like right now, compared to before we started. Talking, how do you feel."
9340.0,Patient,"I feel better and now now we're started creeping into my head I hate it when this hub is like the phone call is about to end and it's like hey what things aren't okay I don't like. You better shut your mouth, right now, this is kind of like the bad thought that just crept into my head was like things are better now But what if things get worse and it will, by the way, because there's been a pattern i'm like Why would you make me realize this. And it's like my brain is telling me like oh everything's pointless you're going to repeat this over and over again, like what's the point and i'm like no it's dope I don't know it's like once I think I try on it's like it's pulling me back down."
705.0,Provider,"And it probably because of the past, like you were saying. You know that sometimes you have a pattern, so you feel good right now, you said you felt better. And in the event that. Changes you know what to do."
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"How to make the phone calls, you know how to attacks and you don't have to do all these coping skills that you've been doing for a long time."
9340.0,Patient,"I think. that's very true it's just like I think for me it's like. I wish everybody would just stay stagnant and just like stable, for once, and you know you can't control feelings, he says come and go, and I. yeah so it's something my brain is trying so hard to understand, especially I think get her borderline personality disorder or it's like. I like someone one day the next day i'm like I really hate you. And then one day i'm just like oh really happy and then the next day it's just like a really bad low it's like I want to die, today I want to kill everyone today and it's like. And then other days of just like Why would you think about killing other people that's terrible so it's just like up and down up and down it's like I wanted to stop, I just wanted to be like smooth and stable."
705.0,Provider,"Can you ever that time comes to like let's say you do get highly upset with someone and you do have that specific person what i've heard is the same thing is don't sit on it. You make the phone call, and then we will get that person help, we will get you help and support you. And today, too, because I always check in with. Everything are you feeling like there's anyone that you want to hurt or harm."
9340.0,Patient,"No, not today and. yeah it's just like I feel terrible saying that like. say that I do want to hurt people, even though, like I most likely won't act on it is the possibility, like that very small chance that I might act on it and it it scares me I guess. Like now what scares me in the moment where he wants to do is like, oh no i'm set on doing this and it's like like it doesn't happen, but it's just like i'm scared that I can't control my feelings."
705.0,Provider,"What you're learning about yourself, though, is even though it's the incident scary and you can have some fear about it is you. are reaching out just like you're saying it now. When i'm concerned is when people don't share. When they don't say this is how I feel and they let it just for a long time, or they don't talk about it and it."
9340.0,Patient,Does.
705.0,Provider,"The emotions good stronger than naming act on it more, but this is. The way that you have a lot of stuff awareness and you're like you know what i'm not gonna hold this in i'm going to share it and that's powerful it's just being able to get it out. Because our minds are always trying to process and make sense of stuff just like your dream, where it's like trying to make sense, you know. What are you doing then what's the rest of the evening."
9340.0,Patient,"um my singing teacher that I had last semester she's inviting me to game night, possibly, but other classmates will be there, I tried to go. Because I said I would I want to like we did agree on me, bringing my violin and possibly my flute, so we will play a little bit, we will jam out she she also plays piano. and On I have a couple plans on Sunday my mom is going to help me. dye my hair a new color which i'm excited about because i'm getting tired of this hair i've had this for a while and it's like this see blue green which I don't like I don't like that ginger Green, I just want to be pure blue. So I will attempt to make it a pale pale ice, but it doesn't work. Well, I do have wigs so and the last thing would be in at the concert, I think I figured out an outfit to where it's a little out there, but, like, I think it would fit um so the band. They have a lot of like secret lore that you can look into as a fan like they make it for their fans and in the recent videos they would have people in lab coats trying to like study them and they would have like subliminal messages I guess with with this guy in a. skull costume I guess not really a skeleton he just has like a school and everything else is normal. So I plan on dressing up like as a lab science it's just going there but i'm not sure how i'll get like the logo, they have pins of like the lab place that they made up, so I would like to try, by that but no, no, no um but yeah. I think the outfit our stuff underneath it to show that I like to be relatively normal but, like the lab coats just kind of like i'm supporting you but in an outlandish wave. And I feel like it can't tell my friends that because they're gonna be like this will be like bark bark I don't care you're killing my movie no I don't want to talk to you so."
705.0,Provider,You can agree to disagree on that you are going to embrace your uniqueness and they.
9340.0,Patient,"exactly like I do when I hear it, we can agree to disagree um but it's not gonna affect it i'm going to do you're just making me feel bad, so I won't say."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I am glad that you were able to call in and that you were able to talk about it and Napoleon seems. Like he's better."
9340.0,Patient,yeah I just needed some hopping around in my room instead of on a hardwood floors.
705.0,Provider,"Right and then you have Valerie that's there to your tactic to support you and kind of give you those those little nudges you know. yeah yeah. And tonight with gain point, I think that sounds fantastic we get out there, and maybe do something, you know that you find enjoyable and just see how it goes."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I guess all i'm worried about now it's, just like the big stuff like doing my exam slash essay. And in the course paper but that's pretty much it I I still have some time yeah."
705.0,Provider,And that's good that you're like you know what i'm not allow myself give myself permission tonight. Go to game night have some enjoy ability and then tomorrow back to the.
9340.0,Patient,Sea on back to the books yeah. And idea.
705.0,Provider,"I like that plan and in the event that if you meet us all, as you have all i'm going to send this to your email to just keep it on."
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And you know again that's what you did exactly what what I always tell people don't marinate on it, yes call you know whether it's the tax whether it's quite hard and help or if it's the 988. just call someone."
9340.0,Patient,yeah. And in the event that it changes you're agreeing you would go to either you know the nearest emergency room or make a call.
705.0,Provider,"alright. Well, good what time is your game night."
9340.0,Patient,"And they always start at seven but they're always like okay if, like you come later, like last time I went they went up until like two is 3am and i'm just like okay i'll just come like later i'll probably. Work a tiny bit on my essay exam just to like write an outline of like what I would like to write and then i'll probably get going."
705.0,Provider,I liked how you just know limited where you're like i'm writing a tiny bit of an outline and then i'm going to go.
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,It was.
9340.0,Patient,You I know Napoleon still Connor running around over there. guys a little clumsy way got back up which i'm very happy. yeah I didn't think he'd be able to get up on his own but actually he can so i'm kind of surprised.
705.0,Provider,He sounds like he's maybe gotten a second wind today.
9340.0,Patient,yeah and also it's very sweet how like he keeps like licking it i'm like oh you're so sweet.
705.0,Provider,"Well, I will then look forward to you know, maybe we'll meet again never know sometimes. I facilitate groups and fill in for. People and things like that."

705.0,Provider,"See alright have a great one. Patient created a safety plan, I will email the safety plan patient agreed to reach out if she is feeling suicidal again patient and saying that she had had some thoughts about it, but she has no plan no intent. Patient through the safety, basically, is low assessment at this time she's not acting on anything she's very goal oriented she presented a bunch of protector. Factors such as the obligation to her pets obligations to her family so as of right now, it would be low risk on the assessment patient has her safety plan and we will go from there."
