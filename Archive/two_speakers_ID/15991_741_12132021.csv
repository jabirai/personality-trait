Okay, and have you been itching had pins and needles are burning or numbness or anything like that in your extremities. and your fee okay. Do you have diabetes. Okay. All right, your connection that you're I can sometimes hear you and sometimes not I don't know what that's a function of do you. Okay, I hear you now. All right. Now I think it's a function of the Internet. um. Okay, well, I think that my concerns, then I you know, I was concerned that you are having still having some serious detoxification from the alcohol and was concerned about your safety with that, because you had mentioned in one of. One of your assessments that you were seeing things and having headaches and all of that stuff which made me really uncomfortable and then you didn't show up and I was concerned. Do you still have all those people living on your property and not pitching in financially."
15991.0,Patient,well.
741.0,Provider,"Yes. Okay. Well, it seems to me that we might I don't know. This is your recovery and we need to do what what you think is best for your recovery um, but it seems to me we might need to work on some boundaries. I can't hear you. You can try. Okay okay they're trying to kick in. All right, so everybody is struggling financially. Okay, all right. All right, um. Okay, so what would you like to accomplish through treatment. Okay, so you don't want to be depressed all the time either. high."
15991.0,Patient,Low. whoa whoa whoa whoa.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're waiting on your social security to kick in."
15991.0,Patient,or.
741.0,Provider,"out okay so you've applied for disability. Oh no. for social security okay. So. yeah waiting for them to approve it and get it started. Okay okay. yeah sometimes those emotions don't move very fast like we'd like for them to. alright. Well we've stopped drinking, so now we need to figure out a relapse prevention plan. Okay. So um what I usually do is email. Some worksheets that will help us figure out what the behaviors are before you start to drink. Some of the triggers. And then, once we figure out all of those details, then we can write a detailed relapse prevention plan. And then learn the skills necessary to implement that plan does that make sense. Okay, and and that way we can. We can actually put together a plan so that when you start engaging in those behaviors, then you know what to do, okay. um We already know that depression is a trigger for you. worry and anxiety is a trigger So those are some skills we're going to want to learn. How, what do we do to. change the way we're thinking okay. and also some skills to do to deal with the anxiety. Now, Dr pachter may be able to help you, with your depression some you may give you some temporary assistance with that I don't know you'll have to talk with him okay. And, but one of the things that I would like to ask you to do is that to start out with and i'm gonna give you. i'm going to send you an email that has this worksheet that talks about warning signs okay. And i'd like for you to look it over and then write down your answers to the questions okay. Another thing I want, I would like to ask you to do is. Every morning when you get up, I would like, for you to write down. Five things that you're grateful for. Okay. Every day, five things that you're grateful for. You can do that. I know it doesn't make any sense, but it will help, believe me. I know. it's it may take you a little bit to figure out what five things you are grateful for. I understand it may take a while, for you to get a whole five. Okay. I know you're grateful for your granddaughter. yeah there's one right there see. I know you have lots of things that you're grateful for it's just really hard you have to work at focusing on them. Okay. And, did you not say that you have a lot of grief also. Okay, so I you and interested in doing a little bit of work on that on how to deal with that grief. i'm sorry. Okay, all right. yeah grief process that takes time and it's not linear it it's not a you can go forward and backward through all the stages. And the stages don't have time limit. So it's one of those things that. there's several different stages that we go through some of them are shorter and some of them are longer and. I would venture to say that you're in the depression stage of grief and that you may be a little stuck there and we'll have to work to get you unstuck okay. yeah. So um wants to work. i'm writing notes sorry because otherwise I won't remember what to send you and how to help. i'm sorry. yeah sometimes we have memory loss."
15991.0,Patient,Oh.
741.0,Provider,"Am I right so. Okay, let me ask you another question, just so that I haven't straight in my head and i'm pretty sure I asked you when we did our assessment, but do you have a religious preference or a spiritual. Part of your of your life. Okay. Okay, do you believe that what you are raised is true. Okay okay. and Have you ever been to an A a meeting. What did you think of it."
15991.0,Patient,wasn't really. Large.
741.0,Provider,"OK OK, I can understand that and. Would you be willing to attend to an aa meeting online. And because I think that that you might be able to find a meeting that talks about solutions online and would give you some extra support and you may have to try several different ones, but there's usually a pretty large. Number to choose from. And you can all you have to do is Google. A online and then it will bring up a list of a meetings. And you can try different ones just make sure that when you go to the meeting listen to them and see what they're talking about. If they're talking about old drunk along and the past, then you don't want to go back to that one if they're talking about solutions like how they live today without drinking, those are the ones you want to go to okay. um and yeah it would, as with anything you're going to go places and and there's going to be some people who are really they're trying to to improve their life, and then there are other the others there who are just going through the motions for whatever reason. I mean you're going to have. authentic and and funny people where we ago. But the key is to pay attention to the ones who really seem like they're trying to change their life. Okay. So um. i'd like for you the next Okay, you and I need to meet twice a month okay. Right yeah it's not always easy it's not always easy i'll tell you that, right up front, but i'm what i'm before we leave are making another appointment for us, so that will get to in this month okay. and What i'd like for you to do. going to send you that email, and I want you to do the gratitude five things that you are grateful for, and then attend one meeting between now and the next time we meet okay. So that way we can work on I get started on i'm moving forward, because I think you'll feel better if you're actually taking some steps to move out of where you're at you know. Well, because I don't know about you, but I get really sad and and depressed when I don't feel like i'm making any progress. So has your family been supportive of what you're trying to do."

What about Christmas to Africa, I already know that you're an economic situation where it's not possible for you to do what you'd like to do for Christmas, I get that part okay.

Like looking to see if you can find somebody who has angel trees. Well, we can put where you can put your grandchildren's name on the tree and maybe somebody can help y'all was getting just some little something for them, you know would that make you feel better. Maybe, or maybe not. yeah. it's hard to reach out and say I need help and. yeah. yeah.

But it's time to stop sitting there worrying about it and start doing something about it, you know. cuz we can sit and worry all day long but that's not gonna fix it. So, and I really do believe that you'll feel better about yourself and about your situation if you'll just put one foot in front of the other and take care of one or two things that will help, and you can get some momentum okay."
15991.0,Patient,So. we'll be.

Wait you're still spinning your wheels in your head right. it's time to take action, put one foot in front of the other and take some action, even if you have to ask the kids to help you okay. i'm sure you'd much rather asked one of your kids to help you then somebody some stranger right. Oh OK. So. Ask one of the kids to help you contact the electric company and find out, whose name the account is in. Once you find that out, you know what you can do."
