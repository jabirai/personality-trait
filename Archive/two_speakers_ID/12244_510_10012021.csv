12244.0,Patient,You run. Like my headphones.
510.0,Provider,Okay.
12244.0,Patient,"justice. Today, and of course I forgot to give them my data first and then. eventually take me in anyways just good so."
510.0,Provider,"Yes, I did get a notification you checked in."
12244.0,Patient,Can you hear me.
510.0,Provider,I can.
12244.0,Patient,hear me yeah okay good yeah.
510.0,Provider,"So before we dive in there are a couple things I wanted to update you on I finally have the name of your new therapists now the care navs should be out reaching you later this week or early next week to get you on her schedule. Her name is Sean, and so it is a female but her name is Sean and she will be your new therapist."
12244.0,Patient,I just wanted to see what Sean is like like the mayor named Sean.
510.0,Provider,As spell.
12244.0,Patient,A w in.
510.0,Provider,"Yes, it is spelled sh aws but I always like to clarify, I have a couple other clients are like is that a male female like notes."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah because China is also may have name. Yes, name yeah yeah."
510.0,Provider,"It is yeah I think you'll like her she's very approachable but just now, you have the name, so the care navs know to be outreach in you to ask you to come to the virtual clinic to get on her schedule so yeah. I got that and that will happen yeah."
12244.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good, thank you."
510.0,Provider,"you're welcome now your group will remain the same shauntel is still your prescriber. But I also got a notification around. Some survey issues, so I want to kind of spend a few minutes, just to review the surveys. I know yeah very frustrated so lack a little bit about."
12244.0,Patient,"I just want you to talk about that to you first thing. too, because I don't understand what's going on with that. They basically want me to do. Three of them every week, which I think is just outrageous because we discussed this, also in the group and the day thought it was one of them was. Every three weeks like like they had a different idea of what what I was told, and then I asked again and I got this message that I was supposed to do two three of them each week and I just told them that that's too much. And, and especially because they are all the same it's all totally repetitive, so I told them if they if they want to, they can put that all into one survey and then it's okay now do it, but if it's three of them I just won't do it so."
510.0,Provider,"I know, and I, I saw that the interactions so i'm not here to say you're going to be discharged over it, but please understand that it is, it is a behavioral health guideline and program expectation, so I know shauntel. Has it noted, as well, so just you know i've never seen anyone completely discharge over it, but if there's a flat out refusal to do certain things it potentially could become that. And so I if I hear you, it is a lot bright heart has a very different approach and how it manages and provides treatment and services, so if you feel like you know. This justice too much this isn't working for me, then, I really encourage you, whether it be shauntel your new therapist certainly we can talk about it today for. You know, is this the right fit then, because this is this is sort of how bright heart, you know operates, and that will be the expectation, so I don't know what are your what are your thoughts."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah well i've been wondering about that too, and since it's going to be a new therapist nice like Maybe I should reach out to one of the other provide you know other services that were given to me should be can pallets when I first signed up for this."
510.0,Provider,And oh that's right that's right that yeah. gotten the list from them.
12244.0,Patient,"God yeah yeah. So I mean I could reach out to them again and. So on but you know, but then who who guarantees me that any other. service does not require all of this is is this kind of do you feel like. it's kind of extraordinary that they are asking for so much, I think."
510.0,Provider,"I think, because bright heart has such a different modality and the type of patients that works with I think if you went to a small private practice, you are not going to be doing surveys, I can assure you. yeah you know if you're just there are a lot of you know therapists out there, that you know do Tele health and it's a small practice they don't they don't require that right. But with a Tele health very large program that does MED management, we work with eating disorders mental health substance abuse. There there's a reason we have these measures in place because we're needing to track by data but we're large right So if you into a smaller practice I don't think you'd be doing surveys."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't know if the smile practices. If that would be, you know that would be free of cost for me, that is, the the whole issue."
510.0,Provider,"You know I don't know what that would be a question yeah through your insurance provider and the actual if you identified. Another therapist but yeah so it's sorta you have to kind of weigh you know the pros the cons and sort of then decide what what it is that you want to do. I hear you you're not the first person that says, I really don't want to do all these surveys and I just have to gently say, well, these are the guidelines, please keep that in mind, like I said i've never seen anyone just flat out discharge over it, but if there's a consistent refusal. You know, it will be something that has to be talked about which i'm glad we're talking about today. Just yeah be that space, but just you know, so you do have the option obviously of looking at other providers that maybe wouldn't require a group or wouldn't require surveys to be done, etc, so yeah."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I have to think about this because. I think it's really abuse, I mean I really think i'm sorry but it's i'm not you know it's really I mean I don't understand what why they are asking all these questions so many times, I mean what do they think they think people are somehow automatic or stupid or."
510.0,Provider,"You know if I ask a question rosslyn yeah no it's not that at all again large number of patients we're tracking data we're tracking your progress, and that is the best way to be tracking progress, besides, obviously the self report, but how do you aggregate that data and that progress. Through surveys. yeah sorry you feel it's abusive and yeah."
12244.0,Patient,"It is, I think it is it's it's kind of like like you know kind of making me feel like my time isn't worth anything, because I have to do every question like three times because they are all it's not you know it's I wouldn't mind doing it doing it once but. Why are they asking me to do three of them each week if the questions and all three of them are pretty much the same. That is just. Nonsense I mean why don't they just you know put together their own survey, which then has each of the questions in there one time, instead of having like some kind of. I don't know it seems like they are kind of pre made surveys that they are getting from somewhere and because somehow they have different names and for different purposes. They make you do it three times, that is just I mean you know as like well, maybe I should just offer to them that out all right one survey for them out of all the questions you know I mean they probably say no, but. it's."
510.0,Provider,"You don't have to do that I know. you're offering, but I think the biggest thing at this point you'll need to kind of reflect if this will. be the right fit for you so yeah, especially if you feel if it's abusive I mean that's, the last thing we want a patient to be feeling like. This is an I know I look at the pH Q nine and I guess seven before my as a therapist before my actions to get a snapshot of symptoms severity. So I guess you really you're sort out a little bit of a turning point here like figuring out if it's something you want to continue. or not and and, whatever your decision it it's fine there's no judgment, but I think I just wanted to make sure you understood kind of be the guidelines, and I know shauntel has it on her list. Because you don't you don't take medications which on tell. No, no, you don't so actually you wouldn't be seen her. yeah so but she is aware yeah."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I mean she always comes in, and I did. For yes yeah too. And I think she said to discuss it with you, so I don't know it's just. I mean, I have to look at them again and maybe i'll just do something like this to them every second week and they'll just be fine or something you know with me. As you were saying if somebody's computer completely refuses doing them that might become a problem, but maybe i'll just kind of keep them. You know, like just give them something every once in a while so they'll be you know because I think the service are really complete nonsense they don't say anything at all, either, or you know, so I don't even think I mean even one of them is actually a lot, you know. Because they. To me, they don't mean anything at all it's just the same stupid questions, every time, and I mean it's not going to change all the time, you know you'll how you feeling about this that, and you know, and I don't know well anyways i'll try and do it this week and then we'll see. How. How it goes with that."
510.0,Provider,"I am just to play a little bit of a devil's advocate so you hear another perspective, I have a lot of patients, that it is very helpful because they're tracking their symptoms with me as a therapist. Especially around the Depression and anxiety, so I know for you and your experience you're finding it. Pretty useless not helpful ridiculous even abusive, which is a pretty strong word. So i'm just you know it it's for your experience, yes, but for others, especially as a therapist, it is very helpful. Information to track so just keep that in mind, and your experiences, it sounds like it's very different. But it is very helpful in the mental health world to be tracking data, especially around depression, anxiety for people. Here, where mental health. You know clinic so all right well."
12244.0,Patient,"Okay, I feel like we've talked it through any other comments questions you want, no, no, I just I just. Also wondered why why there is so much confusion amongst even the provider is how many of them need to be done, you know because chantelle said oh there's only one that needs to be done, each week you know. But, but they told me no it's it's Sri of them so i'm just very confused about this."
510.0,Provider,"As a matter that I will agree with you there's definitely been confusion and what's communicated to patients that I will validate for sure, so, but hopefully know we've talked it out i'll let shauntel know that we've chatted about it. yeah So hopefully you figure out what you want to do yeah it sounds like you want to continue and I. would be a good, I really do think shawn will be a good match for you. So okay all right. yeah let's let's then shift, because this is our last session. I guess give me an update or how would you like to spend your."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah. Well yeah it's very sad that is the last session that's for sure I you know I mean i'm. Hoping that it's going to continue well with this person, but of course that is said yeah I think I wanted to. I wanted to basically. Just uh. I guess the two things I wanted to talk about is, I just wanted to update you on the. My situation with my family, which is. The basically I they like, I talked to them last week on Friday and I brought up the idea to them that I, maybe I should come at you know at over the holidays around Christmas and and then you know they didn't say much that there was some kind of like. And I saw my dad kind of looking to the side, all the time, because my sister was sitting there I said told you, they cannot communicate with me, without her being there so she's she's always sitting in the room right. And they were kind of asking me questions about cohmad and how it is here with. booster shots and I couldn't see him kind of glance at her like every so often and I knew, you know it was kind of. The thing was probably like oh yeah I guess you are right and i've given booster shots even in America to people who have had who have have had. Madonna vaccines, you know because I guess here it's like the first week seen people are getting booster shots but people are actually not eligible for booster shots, at least in California, I think it's probably the same everywhere. and I knew where this you know where where this is leading. And sure enough. After the like the same day I got a big email for my sister, which only I only read a very small portion of it, I sometimes get really frustrated with it, and it will occupy my mind, and I just decided not to eat her emails. And, but what I did get a glance of is that she was basically trying to discourage me from coming. You know and. I had mentioned to my parents in that conversation, you know, in the in the zoo conversation that we had that I. That flying is really not that big of an issue anymore, because those airplanes that go across the Atlantic have hipaa filters, in which I actually only found out recently, but apparently that's the case."
510.0,Provider,yeah you shared. With me.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah so I told them that and, of course, my sister, then you know, has because she's not trusting in anything way. She doesn't think that she has build any she has her body has build any antibody she thinks because she has preconditions that the vaccine didn't work for her. And she also you know, and then, of course, everything, like everything you know, there is like a negative. aspect of everything is is is drawn into the negative for her so she wrote to me that she she thinks it and she does the way she presents that is like a fact it's not like, I am worried that maybe in the airplanes they might not always exchange the hipaa filters often enough. That is not how she writes it she writes. The problem with that is that in the airplanes they don't actually exchange those hipaa filters often enough, you know, like like things like she can't trust anything you can say whatever you want and. Like she's just putting everything down she is afraid of that thing and i'm sure she has not left their house in 18 months, you know she probably doesn't go on a bus she doesn't go on a train. it's it's you know it's I mean I she and everything I mean my dad has said that everything that comes into the House has to go has to undergo some kind of a PD process and their shoes even you know they can't."
510.0,Provider,Even.
12244.0,Patient,"And then she's vacuuming the floor if somebody comes into the House because she thinks they might be shedding those viruses onto the carpet and it's it's it's insane right, and so I rode my parents and emailed back yesterday with we have kind of set Friday like after this meeting, basically."
510.0,Provider,that's right yeah no. yeah more coke or the Skype well the.
12244.0,Patient,"first time I did not work, the first."
510.0,Provider,"Time it didn't work, last week I."
12244.0,Patient,"got it to work. So, last week we were actually talking for quite a while, and it was quite nice I showed them where I live, you know I just it was Okay, it was not a bad conversation we didn't go vicki into. into any details about you know my concerns of my frustrations with my sister in all of that or my my my problems in life, or whatever, none of that. yeah my sister was there, the whole time too, so. yeah so, then you know and, like the night my sister wrote me that email right away like the next day, and my my dad wrote another one just made. And I think he was probably asked to do that, you know it feels like you know he he he basically said we all think that Christmas is not a good time for you to visit. And he and then he was bringing up all these arguments about. Other things so that I would not be thinking, it has to do with my sister the weather is nice here in Germany during the winter, so I wouldn't know that."
510.0,Provider,"Yes, you do know that yeah and and."
12244.0,Patient,"If you came in in May, we could go to our garden, and you know all those kinds of kinds of things and it's like Bob This is very strange and I told them that, last night I wrote an email and said, you know all your arguments they just seem like pretexts. In the test, you always wanted me to come at Christmas and I never did, and you always. made about this, and now that I would want when I come at Christmas you're trying to discourage me, so I am assuming this is just pretexts because Center I scared of it, and that is what that is about right. And I said well you know if she's so scared why doesn't she leave for that time she has her own apartment if she can't get that cleaned up enough so that she can be at least sleep there for for a couple weeks, but that's not my problem."
510.0,Provider,yeah.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah so I mean I don't know I kind of doubt, I will be going there I just thought it's going to happen and I don't know if I even want to push it anymore, I am just kind of tired of it at this point, I have to say i'm really. tired of it."
510.0,Provider,"it's a lot of energy. yeah and it's discouraging I i'm not minimizing that I know you're very discouraged, but you you you can't control aspects of this I know. you've made it very clear, you want to visit you want to support them, you want to see them and it sounds like a lot of bears keep being thrown at you, which you don't have full control over. yeah you still have the option of just going you want. But I yeah. I know that's a tougher choice, but I know this is very it's it's really unfortunate that those dynamics still are very much in play."
12244.0,Patient,"it's it's just mind boggling you know that if if their daughter from the who lives in the US is coming once in three years. That that she cannot stay in their house, because the other daughter has a has a problem with it, and you know I wouldn't mind her being there it's not about me it's about her if she has a problem with me being it and she's the one who needs to be isn't she you know. I mean yeah sorry."
510.0,Provider,"yeah you, you have a relationship with your parents you're wanting to see them."
12244.0,Patient,"Death right. yeah I told them, it said. It said that you."
510.0,Provider,You know I bet is.
12244.0,Patient,"That that I that it said, said that they. That they can make a point you know where the where they would be you know I can't remember how I phrased it, but I said it said that my parents are not. Wanting me too to come or wanting to make this work, you know something like that."
510.0,Provider,yeah I agree.
12244.0,Patient,"I agree, you know so at least they know now where i'm standing with us so. You know we'll see we'll have we'll hopefully have a conversation today I don't know if it's going to happen because I sent them the fight last night, they they know we have Friday. You know, we agreed on doing this Friday, so they should be looking at their email but i'm not sure if they will because they they are not very consistent, you know so we'll see what happens. If it's going to happen later today. yeah so yeah and, yes, I think that was one thing I wanted to talk about. And then the other thing was that my i'm still very frustrated about this naval naval naval construction thing which has started, now that."
510.0,Provider,Because it has gone.
12244.0,Patient,"And it's been some days has been really noisy and I measured the noise I got in touch with the city of oakland and found out what the noise. You know the regulations are. there's a threshold and I mentioned it in. 111 day I mentioned that he was over that and I think the other day was too, because it was the same. So an A told us that today and tomorrow, they would be working so also Saturday and the lady her name is Erica is not responding to emails any longer, that I don't other than sending us updates when they are will will be working like what days. But you know she does this last. minute like you know it means. Like I can't invite anyone over anymore like for like branch or something like I used to do you know because I don't know I think going to work on that Saturday was a friend of mine and I went to yoga together just yoga in the park and. She came over one time afterwards for brunch at my house because it's very close to meet, we had a yoga is happening. And then. You know, we kind of wanted to make this into more of a of a of a not not every week but sort of you know, every once in a while just afterward come to my house and and talk and."
510.0,Provider,i'm.
12244.0,Patient,"Not I can't do that anymore, because I don't know if it's if it's on Tuesdays when the yoga is happening so I can't you know I can't promise any work buddy anything and I just feel like my like my personal freedom is basically. You know very limited right now, what I can do and how I can plan and how I can even do my own stuff outside or to my workout side. And the lady is just ignoring us she's we have written emails to both my roommate and I have written like personal emails to her, where we have explained our situation and. tried to get her back on. track to to you know because she had she made an agreement with us in a in a. conversation into my machine yeah. that she would be paying need a fee for the. For the membership at the ceramic studio she did not respond to any of our emails and I had sent her the invite invoice for the studio she just did not respond at all. So so she's basically on the warpath with us so she and I feel like she's really asking us now to be at least my roommate, the problem is a little bit my roommate is very non confrontational. So she I think she has a tendency to rather be exploited or you know, then then then fighting back. or she feeds feels like maybe it's you know, maybe it's not worth our time and, like well it's also not worth my time suffering, you know, and I, you know so i'm like, no, no, this has happened to me too many times in life, and I just can't let other people travel around on me like that anymore. it's don't wanna you know I. So we might try to set up a conversation with the management company that manages our House like my roommate has a good relationship so she says to the woman she's a woman has been here for 20."
510.0,Provider,Years so yeah you remember you said.
12244.0,Patient,"So so that's very possible she says she you know so and that baby it's been that same that same woman all over that time. In that management company and apparently there have been other situations where she helped her with something. So we'll see how that goes and then, after that, I mean there's i'm also in touch with a mediation. I think it's a nonprofit that offers mediation for things like that in in oakland. I don't know it's very annoying but I mean you know if I don't do anything I will just be even more annoyed and frustrated and I will also lose my rights and I just. feel like this is just to a point where we can't just say okay we're gonna let this happen to us for six months, and maybe it's even eight months, who knows right. yeah the landlord here, I will enter it seems to want to refinance and he said, an appraiser. I guess that's kind of I don't know if this is just to pay for anything it's very popular right now that people are refinancing their houses even even houses that are not having any more mortgage I don't understand the whole thing. I didn't understand what that's about but everyone's doing that, right now, so. He sent us this guy and the guy came on a day when it was really noisy, and he was making a comment about it to my roommate to marine that's my roommate. I was him, and they are moving to be displayed or and she told him yeah this is going to go on for a while and he's like well, they should be paying you."
510.0,Provider,got some knowledge at well and you you've been very clear that if she stopped responding that you were you were going to take active steps it sounds like it's it's pretty noisy it's been really just.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's actually not it's only been a few days now, that will really not I see."
510.0,Provider,"But it's going to continue, you know they've only just started, they only at this point they."
12244.0,Patient,"Basically, we were told that they would be turning the brush into housing, but what they actually did they dismantle the garage completely they they tore it down so."
510.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
12244.0,Patient,So so that's what so far been doing.
510.0,Provider,OK OK.
12244.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know what the what the I tried to find. find out about that because permits at least here in oakland they are public domain, so you can go to the permit office in the city of oakland or call them and say hey I want to be information about this in this property. You don't need to have anything to you know don't need to prove who you are, or why you want this information it's public domain, they will give you that information. So, so I asked them about this, and she does have permits to turn that garage into housing and they told me all of that, but they they could they couldn't tell me if that means she actually has the right to tear it all the way down. And then we built from scratch."
510.0,Provider,I don't know that's.
12244.0,Patient,"That sounds a bit weird but maybe it is so that she just has to keep the footprint and can't can't change, you know the the the outline of the you know that it just. has to be on the same the same ground and can be beat or something."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah anyways that's that's the updates and you know the frustrations of my life like if I mean what what this is all leading to and feeding into for me, as you know, is this still the right way of living and being. On a general on a on a broader scale. You know what's coming next. Because this is, I mean, I know that my that this property where i'm living now is going to be forever. And I moved into landlord said it's going to be for five years and that's two and a half years now, so. So i'm sometimes i'm a little like or not sometimes i'm thinking about this a lot actually what's next, and you know it doesn't even make sense for me anymore to live in a city. shouldn't I try and move somewhere else, where I can do my ceramics more."
510.0,Provider,easily or something.
12244.0,Patient,"I don't know but it's like it's very, very difficult to come up with a solution to this problem, because. it's. it's it's it's multifaceted if I go to somewhere in the countryside, that also means there's nobody where I where I can sell my ceramics right. So it's it's all I don't really know and it's, the only thing that I need and want, and you know it's and I don't try and that would have to change, so I find I. Am. Yes, my yeah. So, so I definitely found things very challenging in terms of thinking about my future. And oh shoot my phone has a low battery morning are you still there. Oh yeah okay."
510.0,Provider,I lost you for a SEC.
12244.0,Patient,yeah. I don't know I don't know why my phone is low on battery it shouldn't be. But anyways what time do we have.
510.0,Provider,About.
12244.0,Patient,"25 minutes minutes yeah. yeah so. yeah so like I think. You know, I was thinking a lot about the The thing that you mentioned last week about changing the narrative. You know, and what. If this and just going to somewhere where I can like in my phone."
510.0,Provider,Oh sure yeah.
12244.0,Patient,Take your timeline it's it's it's low and battery.
510.0,Provider,yeah no worries.
12244.0,Patient,"What does it mean you know, to change the narrative I wrote down acoustics about that last weekend. Just to. figure this out for myself. And like you know that's been just changing the narrative mean. You know that I can be I don't want to be. The How should I say the victim anymore of all these things. You know, like. My family like this, this problem with the with that construction. And all kinds of other things where I feel like I don't have really control like like. Why does my future look let's my future going to look like you know how long can I stay here. i'm at the whim of. Somebody else you to you know, in terms of at some point the landlord's going to do something with this and. This wouldn't be such a such an enemy, a lot of people are in that situation, you know where they don't know, but here in the Bay area, this has become so so extreme because rents are so extreme so and it's going up and have an APP you know so. If I lost this housing now or in two years or whenever. It would just be. It would just be how should I say, which is be crazy, you know. Because deadwood I mean I I really can't. Imagine that I would find something where I could you know, unless I would have to be extremely lucky to find something that I can afford. And I mean this place and if now. it's really cool it's really amazing I really love it. Because there is a garden, for the first time in my life and there's that. shit and that work area that I was using outside and the back porch that i'm using we're taking my computer and work outside so you know, so I mean I don't. I i'm 54 years old, so i'm not gonna want to live in a in a tiny little room anymore, with a landlady good lets me barely use the kitchen, you know. it's that's just so So for me it's like what does changing the narrative mean you know, does it mean that I does it mean that I have to fight back on things. Or does it mean that I, you know, does it mean, I have to fight back on things will find those find new solutions for myself, so that I don't feel like i'm i'm a victim all the time. Or does it feel, or does it mean that I have to somehow managed to accept the situation as it is and just change my attitude, I think that was kind of."
510.0,Provider,Like. that's one of the big is.
12244.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah so that was kind of what I came when I came. I came to like you know what what does it mean for me to change the narrative because I think that that's really the point the narrative really needs to be changed. yeah so I just wanted to get to talk to you about that again. You know. Like I mean at the moment it really it really has come down to me just like. Sometimes we hating things and hating people to you know we I think i've told you this that I sometimes feel like if I put like this woman Erica the construction lady she's actually here right now she lives in Germany, but I know she's here right now i've. noticed that yesterday because I put like it's kind of close I heard a conversation, and she was there. And I you know i'm like oh gosh I could only do something, you know really bad. Just. Like you know. What like but but, but also that you know I have, I have found myself also. Pulling myself out of friendships or. People that I know when I feel like Oh, they are just not the kind of people that I should be with because they are. All whatever you know they all are rich or you know, whatever I just because I will, because I feel like I don't fit in you know i'm i'm different and I don't have all these things that they have like has been to pay for their life, and you know. All these like this, so much of that here it's I sometimes call it the the bay area entitlement collab. there's so many people who have a lot of money and it's it's mostly the baby boomers but it's it's it's beyond that. You know where. it's just like sometimes I just feel like Oh, you know, this is a nice person, but then, after some time i'm like oh gosh it's again a person who is like talking about your husband all the time, and we have the husband makes other buddy and. Then they can. You know they are buying a house now if you're there and. You know, like it's just the right friend for me and then I end up like just not wanting to be in touch it's really real it's, not even a conscious decision it's just like i'm just not wanting to be in touch you know."
510.0,Provider,"you're trying to find your people you're. yeah if you continue, and this isn't new, this is, I think that's why you're questioning the area you're having a hard time finding sort of your quote unquote people. yeah trouble and you see yourself in them you feel sort of out of place."
12244.0,Patient,"Yes, I do it's like I mean it's it's so funny because I also in this area, you know I came here for a reason and that it's this this took very long to kick in where I where I got it to the place where I have this feeling, you know. For the longest time all these things didn't seem to matter. Like I didn't care. You know and thinking here that I was different, and I think they still don't care. it's mommy who cares you know, then. All of a sudden, not all of a sudden, I mean it gradually became I gradually became more and more aware of that right. it's like in the past, like let's say like 10 years ago I was still in the you know, I was like whenever I heard about somebody or their parents bought them a house or something I would be so happy for them. You know. And, and now it's more like well good for you, I have no idea where i'll be in the next two years, you know. it's it's sometimes i'm like maybe this has and also it just because I guess the situation here has become so you know it's it's just become tougher and tougher and tougher you know. Maybe 10 years ago I could still say yeah good for you. That your parents bought your House, but I will find a place to you know somehow. Somehow but now that's not so anymore so. You know so sometimes i'm wondering if I just should go somewhere that's not as high strung you know, like I don't know if that's even accept that work that's just like."
510.0,Provider,"This, I think you're I think what you're describing to Sonia is your and this happens, through our entire life. Even as adolescents young adults mid you know mid way point in our 40s 50s our whole life. you're talking about values clarification like what are your core values, what is it that you want to be spending your energy meaning and doing meaningful activities. And kind of your Community that's what you're talking about and it's an evolution and it changes for people and it sounds like it's really shifting. Do you do, you get that do you understand that because I. Am that's why you're questioning it, I also think there's a lot of negativity and your you often will focus on what you don't have. But there are things you do have to and i'm wondering if just the simple strategy of practicing more gratitude, because when we focus and we only expand our energy on what we don't have and the negativity it actually breeds more of that i'm."
12244.0,Patient,Just like we don't have also what's been happening to me when I was have been doing to be you know. Instead of seeing the positive things I have been focusing on the negative things.
510.0,Provider,And and and abby there.
12244.0,Patient,"are negative six things done in the past, you know that may."
510.0,Provider,"Be, but I think it's depleting you to the. point of exhaustion and frustration and the suffering is. is worsening and magnifying i'm not saying there are not issues that you need to be responsive to, but when we're constantly in this fight or flight mode, which I think you spent a lot of time in. that's the hyper arousal state and our our your body and brain it's releasing stress hormones adrenaline and you're going through these constant stress responses you're going to be left exhausted, and you can create a stress response just by having a thought your. yeah it. does not know the difference between a thought and an actual like tigers coming at me so you're basically depleting yourself of much needed resources so. i'm glad you're starting, and this is, I think the whole point of the work we've been doing is starting to question and. there's some different possibilities to shift the narrative it sounds like you like that language shift the perspective, whatever works. Because you are, you are exhausted, you are funneling down what I call the exhaustion funnel let your you're depleting yourself of much needed resources mentally and physically. Does that make sense that's exactly true, and I mean."
12244.0,Patient,"I don't know I just like lately been over the past it's just probably been several months extremely tired and you know just not very energetic, which is so weird for me, you know I always used to be this little ball of energy and like doing so many things and. i'm not getting. things done, because at night when i'm trying to sit down at my computer I just don't get it done because i'm too tired, or you know, like an enemy part of this might have to do with menopause too."
510.0,Provider,yeah we'll talk. about that.
12244.0,Patient,yeah. That is a novelty factor in it. And I think I told you that my my. Physical my man my doctor said not to do any therapy kind of.
510.0,Provider,related. And I talked to explicitly about.
12244.0,Patient,"It. was good, but I did I did indeed I did at one of the. herbs that she suggested and i've been teaching that and I do feel like the sweat stuff like these, these heat, you know these satin. flushes yeah they have not been coming as much."
510.0,Provider,"Oh good yeah okay excellent. Oh good so using an herbal, what are we. are using."
12244.0,Patient,it's called. Black cohosh.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, because sometimes i'm still have their own side effects and whatnot but it sounds like you're tolerating it."
12244.0,Patient,"Okay, well, I don't know I mean there is that I don't know I mean there might be I don't know if the tiredness has to do with that or not, I mean the Titanic. has been here for long road, but it's been very, very a few days. Recently, has been there were a few days, where it's just like insanely extreme. At night, especially, especially at night. But yeah as you were saying you know that is exactly the point the thought you know I mean I have had situations, this week, where recently not. Like we I will be doing stuff I really love outdoor stuff you know. Making."
510.0,Provider,going to the beach or.
12244.0,Patient,"An usually I get totally I used to get totally absorbed into that if I were outside or at the sector, OSHA and walking along the ocean, or something I would get totally absorbed by that and. All I would be feeling and seeing and experiencing would be that, and I would be like flushed with this life."
510.0,Provider,You know and that's part that's a mindfulness meditation practice.
12244.0,Patient,"That thing is that, like, I was actually I went to the ocean just maybe was a couple weeks ago, or something. and I was thinking about you know the whole time I couldn't get all of these things about the most traction out of my mind, because before that I guess the night before it was when I realized that this lady had to be started to completely ignore me and. You know, and then I was at the ocean and as thinking about this, I could not get it out of my mind even then it was horrible, and that is. And I mean the same has happened with my with the problem with my sister the past years, you know, several years man, this is just intruding into my into my consciousness all the time it's really just."
510.0,Provider,eliminate oil it's called.
12244.0,Patient,"ation you, you were experienced and what we call rumination and that again is prompting you into a stress response and you're not able to be in the present moment yes."
510.0,Provider,"And you are separate and you're left exhausted and rumination pretends to be necessary and important and it's not it actually have you ever heard the comment like rumination or worry interchangeable. is like a rocking chair. You know it doesn't get you anywhere it gives you something to do, but you don't go anywhere. And yeah yeah yeah what's happening mentally where you it's the cyclical rumination mind and intrusive thoughts which is generating other emotions. Just cascading into the exhaustion. you're having yes these constant stress responses."
12244.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, yes, and I don't know you know, this is a real problem, because I mean. That construction is kind of a small thing compared to my family thing which is. i'm gonna go away, you know. And I just don't know what that. means you know there's, how can I change that narrative to to you know that narrative to change that I have."
510.0,Provider,"You have to. Well, if if I know because you have such patterned condition thinking we are habitual thinker, Sonia and you are used to having the same thoughts over and. Over and over there for you think these are the right thoughts to be having. And to change the thoughts it literally I know it seems like simple and I know it's not but it literally is changing the thought and, like, I am going to relate to this different i'm going to look at this differently. Because the way it's going you're recognizing it's completely depleting you and it's not working for you. know that you can continue to have the same conditions pattern thinking or you can shift it and be like i'm going to i'm going to look at this from a different perspective. And shifting our thoughts that's the whole point of cvt therapy and also mindfulness once you start shifting your thoughts it changes the emotion, which changes the behavior they're very intricately connected. easier said than done right, but you have to have the awareness, it is a thought and it just because you have a thought does not mean it's always true. you're just so used to having the condition thoughts like you think they're true no they don't necessarily have to be that that doesn't have to be the reality."
12244.0,Patient,"That, I know I mean I guess. I guess the facts are true, you know. The facts how how things out they aren't you but, but the thoughts. They say you know how can I change the narrative How can this be something different, how can I work with this, and I mean 1111 slight idea that I have had every once in a while, is that it just needs to become some sort of. An artwork or you know, like."
510.0,Provider,It you have to accept that I.
12244.0,Patient,"Think I have talked to you about that and I just I. can't get my head around it, yet I don't quite know how this could be. or become that you know, like. Like sometimes i'm like well, maybe I should write a book about it or. You know I mean one one idea that has come to my mind, is when I go back to Germany that i'll. Take my camera and. photograph my parents and our House."
510.0,Provider,and
12244.0,Patient,"If that leads me to something. If they let me do it, I don't know if they will. You know. I mean, I just have to there has just I guess it depends on the way I presented to them, you know. So maybe maybe they will I mean my dad. Is a photographer to so he might have some understanding for it, I think I just have to be careful, my system, I might have a big problem with it and I don't want I don't need to photograph her if she doesn't want to. She probably won't but, but she might even have a problem that i'm photographing them, you know or kind of suspicious suspicious that I, but I might be doing something weird with that or who knows you know but. that's not I mean I guess my parents just I mean it, I think it depends how I present it to them. You know. I mean Maybe she can even relate to it if I say you know this is good for both of us, you know. Just for you to. So, because they're going to die at some point, you know so. yeah I don't know I mean that was one thought I mean it's a very small so art in that context but, but I feel like. I think, maybe if if I be if this became. If this if this became part of an art project, and I would be working issue in an art project, maybe then it would work for me better or I would I would be able to deal with it better, you know, and it would be able to process it in a different way. yeah so I don't know I mean right now the APP road is all about personal stories, but most of it is you know. stories of minorities, and you know suffering stories it's not about so much about family but who knows you know who knows, I mean I should not I should not see it that way and it's a it's a family dynamic story, and it could be interesting, in some ways to somebody at some point."
510.0,Provider,again. You just shifted that perspective right.
12244.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,yeah so well it's all about that well you know it could be this there's always that possibility. I think it's a great idea of how you can maybe channel it through the the artwork which you are an artist through and through that's a big part of how you relate to the world and.
12244.0,Patient,Right.
510.0,Provider,"Right, it makes sense that you would use that as. Maybe as an outlet yeah absolutely. Absolutely mm hmm."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I have to think about that well how you know. As I said, I can't get my head around it totally I mean the other thing about what what am I going to do in my future and where we are to go, I also have an art project in mind. But I would need funding for it and I haven't yet found an organization that i've asked i've asked around but it's. I have this idea that I would actually be traveling to the US and different places that people always tell me about well why don't you go to Kansas city or to gainesville or to be this or to that, and you know. yeah to stare it's a good athletes and. Like go to those places to interviews with artists document them see what it's about and then write about it or do an exhibition about it. So that it would actually be a resource for other artists to. But that's an old idea, not always basically I probably came up with us like two or three years ago and I thought this would be so cool to do I should do this sometime. And maybe I should and I don't I don't know it's just something that I don't know how to do practically know how to actually do in terms of paying for it and. doing all the traveling I don't drive, so I would have to have another. person travel with me, which I would like any ways to do this on my own so that'll. feel real to. Maybe also not quite so I don't know it just doesn't seem that great of an ideal for me to travel or even if I got you know I even if I got try driving lessons and learn how to drive properly I would feel very scared to speak to travel across country all by myself in a."
510.0,Provider,Car.
12244.0,Patient,yeah and it. doesn't seem like a safe idea to me I don't know why I know people do this but I don't know it's not something I feel I feel very comfortable with doing. Okay.
510.0,Provider,"So Okay, and neither I found the book for you, as I was. Listening to you talk, I mean i'm going to give you a another book recommendation I know I gave you accurate total a's."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah you did, and I haven't I haven't gotten it yet."
510.0,Provider,"that's Okay, no and and you don't have to I just. yeah."
12244.0,Patient,"I do love these kinds of. suggestions to because you know, this could."
510.0,Provider,"Well, if you want I, so in my final. A lot of people have. been asking for book recommendations actually i'm going to give me one SEC i'm going to give you. The list that i've been giving. My clients, but then there's another one, while I was listening to you, I think, might also be up your alley so give me one SEC here i'm going to put it in the chat. And this is the main now i've already given you a new earth by occur totally, but these are some of the other books that I have I had so many clients asking me for additional recommendations so here's that list, and then the other one."
12244.0,Patient,Can you send me that this via email.
510.0,Provider,Oh yeah I can't. Because yeah I.
12244.0,Patient,"can't actually see Okay, I see it, but I can't have no way to you know to copy that. Okay."
510.0,Provider,"All right, well, most people were just taking a screenshot but oh."
12244.0,Patient,"I don't know how to do this while i'm on the phone with you no worries no worries. Okay, so since my phone not my you know not my computer so."
510.0,Provider,"yeah OK so just so you can see the list. yeah the name of the other one that all included email it's by Julia Cameron and it's called the artist's way. And so, when I was listening to you, I mean you are an artist and obviously this book isn't just for artists it's it's for anyone, but it talks about tapping into and ways to tapping into. Your creativity and as you're you know thinking and reflecting on this narrative I think this might be a good book to look at work to consider so i'll email it later today to the email, we have on file i'll send these to you, but I just wanted to say out loud the artist's way. All included on this list."
12244.0,Patient,"To okay awesome. Yes, yeah perfect. How I can't get rid of it okay yeah yeah that sounds really cool the other sweet sounds actually very familiar title."
510.0,Provider,"it's been around yeah there's the I think the 25th anniversary edition just came out or very recently, like yeah it's a very well known book and it's a great book I have it. I think it might as you're talking about kind of your next steps and you're really reflecting that book might really helped prompt you and ways to kind of explore that. So i'll i'll send it to you."
12244.0,Patient,"So yeah yes Thank you so much, these are really great ideas and. It has helped me really a lot to talk with you about all of us and I I just like is the is Sean going to to have access to you know."
510.0,Provider,"You don't have recordings and all of that, with you. still have access to all my notes I don't think the zoom recordings, because those are actually deleted once they're transcribed and I find them, but she will have access to all that. And I do think you too will will get along. So i'm glad you found our work together helpful i'll send those book recommendations uh let shauntel do we have talked about the surveys. Yes, and you're you're figuring out how to find your balance and. And vironment. Yes, all i'll let her know that we have."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah okay. And I think I would I would I would hope that with Sean I could you know continue this conversation about. Current narrative and changing the narrative. For myself, so that it's that it's not negative anymore, and that is that it can become something positive."
510.0,Provider,That I am.
12244.0,Patient,"Somehow deal with because I think that's it has it's really, really important that I do that because otherwise it's going to take me down really. it's."
510.0,Provider,it's ul you're going to remain depleted and exhaust.
12244.0,Patient,"Yes, and so you know, yes."
510.0,Provider,"When you have your joining session, which means your net your first session with her. I know as a therapist when I inherited new clients, I always ask well what. was helpful that you were working on with your. Former therapist that you'd like to continue."
12244.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"I mean i'm hoping Sean will have those sorts of questions, but if she doesn't you offer it to her Sonia go. yeah, this is what I was working on with Tara, this is what really i'd like to kind of continue and go from there, so I."
12244.0,Patient,guess right yeah.
