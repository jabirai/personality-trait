14811.0,Patient,"Well, when I went down to. See the recruiters down in Denver at the time was I. I when I first went down there I didn't like this the jobs they offered me, so I decided I wasn't going to join i'm changed my mind. And my recruiter called me back he called me he says how you doing ace he says, can we. And I told him what happened to me, I said, these guys are trying to pressure me into a giant signing up for something I didn't want to do you know. They said you scored real high and mechanical we want you to be a jet engine mechanic and I said well. Correct me if i'm wrong in that just bigger tools and bigger parts and more grease I said I don't like working on cars, I don't think I like working on planes, you know. And like I said they they pressured me into trying to do that, then they said we want you to be a parachute rigger and I could just imagine if I made a mistake or something somebody died I would never be able to live with myself so. When he he said what he said to me, was he said what if I we get in my car and i'll personally take you down there i'll personally work with you on a computer until we figure out something to that you'd like to do. And so I did that with him and. We went down and. Dental assisting came up and and I didn't know much about it, I said well. i'd be i'd be up for something like that, because when he told me, you know, he says you're probably work in an air conditioned building in a hospital or a Jason to a hospital or whatever. And you'll work bankers hours probably eight to 430 will end up being 734 30 Monday through Friday and and that was and then I had weekends off, so it wasn't a bad deal at all, it worked out pretty good, very good for me."
