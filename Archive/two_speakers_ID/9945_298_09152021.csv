298.0,Provider,hi there Angelina. let's see i'm bringing up your chart.
9945.0,Patient,Of course.
298.0,Provider,Can I see a picture of you.
9945.0,Patient,A picture of me I mean there's one on screen.
298.0,Provider,"know I mean, let me get that right, can we start the video okay so. Who was talking to me about you, your therapist I think was concerned about you. manny yeah. yeah Okay, what is it that we were going to work on today."
9945.0,Patient,"Well, so what we so we were talking in my appointment on Monday. And i've been having a lot of hypomania episodes almost daily for the last three or four months. Okay, and i've been trying to just learn coping mechanisms and I missed seeing him for a few months there but i'm fully back now and we were talking and he doesn't think any self regulation techniques or coping techniques are going to work unless we put me on some kind of. mood stabilizer to help with my bipolar too. And I remember last time you are saying you wanted to put me on like a low dose of lamictal."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
9945.0,Patient,"To kind of help cuz i'm it's also exhausting to have a manic episode every day because it's like a lot of the times I don't even realize i'm manic and. i'm at that point where i'm just screaming or i'm so depressed that I want to sell farm. I just the man sicknesses so out of control, at this point. of death. i'm like a day or two, where I don't have. As much mania but it's still extremely exhausting to have it all the time."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
9945.0,Patient,"That and i'm a little scared to start medication because i've never had a mood stabilizer before. And i'm on a heart medication, too, and I take birth control song just part of me is scared and one of my friends has been on lamictal for epilepsy and they're like lamictal is a really intense medications though they had another really high dose because they're they're epileptic so."
298.0,Provider,"Right and we're not using it for. That part we're just using it for mood stabilizing it helps when irritability and anger. it's a game changer for a lot of people, the reason I like lamictal is because it's a little more gentler than other mood stabilizers."
9945.0,Patient,"that's kind of what i'm wanting to start off with this something gentle like and like I like to be informed, because i've been really scared over the last few days, because, like i've had a couple of friends be like. don't manifest bad energy on the medication don't put yourself into a placebo effect of having a bad thing and i'm like okay you're telling a mentally ill person. But I have bipolar too, so my anxiety and depression, are in tandem, along with the anger that comes with the mania so i'm, just like the only raw."
298.0,Provider,yeah I hear you.
9945.0,Patient,feel better at this point.
298.0,Provider,"And the downside of this medicine is it takes time we go so slow. at adding the next level. So listen, this is how slow you go for you take 25 milligrams once a day for the first two weeks, then, after two weeks, you can take 25 milligrams in the morning and 25 milligrams at night that's 50 milligrams. Then, after you now you've done a month because you do that for another two weeks at the month, mark you can go to 100 milligrams. Another two weeks goes by, and you can go to 150 milligrams somewhere between 150 and 400 is where you get the relief. The reason why we go so slow is, if you go fast that you run the risk of developing a rash on your body that's called Steven Johnson syndrome. And this is very rare, but I have to tell you, if you develop the rash you stop taking the medicine and it's a very distinct rash Okay, and you call into the virtual clinic and i'll get you in and we'll talk about it. i've not had anyone who had a rash, not many people have, but we still have to tell you about it. um it's like our number one go to medicine for irritability and anger at kami you know, for that you're not going to feel it like a benzodiazepine or something that would really like numb you it doesn't work like that."
9945.0,Patient,"I don't want that's the main effect, I don't want cuz like i'm scared to be on like a high dose around 150 and stuff i'm really scared to be on a dose that high."
298.0,Provider,That are not high that's 150 is not hiding 400 is high hundred and 50 not most people are somewhere between 150 and 200 and some need 300 but hundred and 50 is kind of my that's where I think we might see relief with you. But you know i've not had the chance to work with you on. Any other things so i'm hoping that this will be a success. yeah you know.
9945.0,Patient,"i'm just i'm hoping, so too, because, like it would be nice to not have these manic episodes where I just get so upset that I start screaming at my partners because I don't want to be doing that and a lot of the times it's not even something that should be. Like it could be over a cat."
298.0,Provider,yeah no.
9945.0,Patient,"Like there's no real reason for it, or the opposite effect happens and I get so depressed and upset because of it that I just shut down entirely. Right and. Well, I just I am sick of both of those."
298.0,Provider,I would love to help you it just takes time to find.
9945.0,Patient,The right medical understand.
298.0,Provider,"yeah and so i'm sending a month supply in a for you right now and. And then. i'd like to see you let me know in group, let me know in a MED follow up it wouldn't hurt to make a MED follow up now so it's on the books for you."
9945.0,Patient,"All right, fine doing that."
298.0,Provider,Are you suicidal right now.
9945.0,Patient,Nobody so not at all.
298.0,Provider,Okay okay.
9945.0,Patient,"No suicidal thoughts just thoughts of like. I should be hurting myself i'm upsetting my partners like I shouldn't hurt myself stuff like that, but I haven't really been doing that i've been callin sing a lot to the point my hands hurt, but I haven't been like cutting or anything like that."
298.0,Provider,Oh i'm so glad to hear that is anything else going on in your life right now.
9945.0,Patient,"there's been a lot going on. So I think I told you at the beginning of the year, my great grandpa passed which reawakened a lot of my traumas, then I found out a few months after that my grandpa has cancer. And that's a massive. And then, a week ago I found a week or two ago I found out one of my biological sisters was involved in 13 armed robberies and she was an accomplice to murder. So. And this morning we just found out that one of my partner's close trans friends, she died she hung herself."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, that broke my heart."
9945.0,Patient,So it's just been going through a lot for me.
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah understandably so i'm glad to hearing counseling how are you sleeping.
9945.0,Patient,"i'm sleeping okay um i'm waking up at least once or twice a night but that's mostly because my rabbits get really rambunctious. And, but I have been having a lot of nightmares. Like I used to have night terrors and nightmares every night. And they've kind of come back over the last few months i've started having a lot of nightmares again, and it makes it so that I have a hard time falling asleep because I don't want to have nightmares. manners aren't."
298.0,Provider,"fun now that's true ptsd and you know I treat ptsd all the time with those nightmares i'm just i'm dropping that in your head, that there is a medicine out there for those nightmares."
9945.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
9945.0,Patient,"All right, i'm just hoping that this medicine, will make that will kind of help with the. Because from what i've heard it's kind of like an all around mood stabilizer, but it can help with the Depression and anxiety that comes from my madness too. So. I just I just I need a little extra help right now and. But the hardest thing, I think, though, is I haven't ever actually I never actually read anything about it until yesterday and I didn't know this, but bipolar is having bipolar to means that I have to have lifelong treatment for it. And it's hard to accept that."
298.0,Provider,"It is especially for you, if it's hard for you. I want to be there for you as long as you let me."
9945.0,Patient,"Well yeah, of course."
298.0,Provider,"All right, i've got to go on to Lena, thank you for taking the time to. see me."
9945.0,Patient,"Of course, thank you have a good day."
