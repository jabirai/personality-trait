And we always have really deep conversations, so I was actually kind of down afterwards, because I was also tired. And then that weekend my friends and I were playing a lot so. I didn't really I wasn't really up I wasn't really down, you know, I was distracted the entire weekend. playing with my friends, when I was going to bed and stuff like that you know I had a lot of thoughts going through my head of like you know my aunt moving way and. My friends and I doin stuff so you know going to sleep was kind of an issue because I had a lot of thoughts bouncing around in my head and stuff like that, but I was eventually able to get to sleep um the Monday after that. or this Monday. um I was doing okay. I was doing Okay, you know I had relatively even minutes I said I had. A couple of days, where I went up and down a Tuesday. Tuesday was. for lack of a better term a shit show, I was supposed to go to group and my aunt who like I said was moving away called me like eight o'clock before my group. And she was like hey, this is the last time that we're going to be able to meet before I moved away, and I was like I got group but. I gotta go see you anyway, so I miss group um. And then. So I was really nice it was really nice seeing or talking to her, I was with her the whole day um and then about six o'clock I get the message that I miss group. And I started getting really scared and stuff like that, because you know, Miss group don't want to get penalized or anything like that, and so that's been kind of on my mind so i've been interest for the past couple of days and then today.

You know bipolar disorder, but it doesn't say specifically which bipolar it is, but he come you little bit about. You know, like gone, because people who experience you know what you're telling me, you know sounds a little bit like hypomania so the flight full bond, you know manic. episodes like you're not going out and doing maybe because you're restricted a little bit with what you can do you know, in terms of finances and stuff like that, but doesn't sound like you're you know acting out in ways that are impulsive. You can tell know more about yourself and. Then you know I know about you, you have you know how old, are you."
15804.0,Patient,25.
759.0,Provider,"And you have 25 years of experience, then you know, on you need not just have my professional judgment. But you tell me what this those you know, when you say like you know manic Armenia, but this is episodes look like."

You have ago yeah it's really hard for me not to like gamble either you know, am I video games with the loop boxes or i've never been to a casino. Because I just don't have the funds, but I do have problems, you know. If I do have some kind of funds, you know, whenever I get on manic episode i'm thinking like okay Why am I saving this you know I just pick something up just ties, you know i'll impulsively spend. The only thing that really softly is the lack of funds in general, you know."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15804.0,Patient,"yeah, but I do worry about that, because if I do get funds I don't want to just like blow them on random stuff when I do get into a manic episode episode, because I know it's really hard for me to control myself."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15804.0,Patient,When it comes to stuff like that. um. and also the gambling problem I I absolutely have a gambling problem.

15804.0,Patient,"mm hmm and also it's. I don't know if i'm personally an alcoholic I don't like the taste of alcohol or anything like that, but I have alcoholism on both sides of my family, so I don't chance it. that's The one thing that I am really convicted on is no drugs no alcohol and that's one thing that i'm like. 100% on. um I wish I could do that with the impulsive spending and the gambling in stuff like that, but like luckily. I found it, I found free ways to gamble. Like with you know free poker games and. You know, doing stuff on my games and stuff like that, where I can gamble but. I am afraid that once I get some money i'm going to like start betting on you know, like football games and stuff like that um. Because like I said it's just the rush whenever i'm gambling it just like I have have another head and a half to have take another. swing of the slot machine, even though i've already lost my ass on the game, you know it's just like because then i'll make my money back and then step cash now you know I like go again and again and again i'll dig myself another hole and then try and get back out of it. sucks it really, really frickin sucks."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you feel like a really you know, a sex between you know being having a gambling problem and spending your money. So we definitely want you not to feel as though you know that we have to. be doing not. remind me of the medication you're taking."

Okay, but um she insists, I was in that I hated it and that I. didn't stay on it very long um but also. Back then. I was diagnosed with bipolar depression, but I didn't really have manic episodes I only really had depressive episodes. So they were dealing with my depression more than you know the ups and downs, and then the ups and downs started. A couple years ago, you know really bad I always had ups and downs, but I had way more Downs than I would ever have upside have ups, maybe once or twice a month, so it wasn't that big of an issue."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15804.0,Patient,Nowadays it's. all over the place.
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah maybe getting on the mood stabilizer now and seeing how you react to it and how you do with it. might be something to discuss as well and, once you to be writing down some things to talk to shauntel you know, like next time. That you with her, I want you to really describe the fact or tell her the fact that I have been diagnosed with bipolar depression. And you know, like from when I was younger, but now I feel like i'm cycling from mania to on depressive episodes pretty rapidly from day to day. You know, and so, and you know, be able to just have an open dialogue with her and just say like you know, maybe getting on a mood stabilizer might help with you know, like even out my mood so i'm not cycling from one one extreme to the other extreme.

15804.0,Patient,Let me take. yeah there there's a million of them here.
759.0,Provider,"good to know. So maybe looking at that and see playing around with the APP and see which one works well for you in terms of tracking your mood you know, like, I think that would be good good suggestion for you."

15804.0,Patient,are no.
759.0,Provider,"No, we didn't talk about affirmations maybe we just talked about the new tracker for now. Like i'm kind of doing the do you have friends right people that you can go out and hang. Out with him right yeah so you know, sometimes with depression, you know, like he I I wrote down this you'd like to retreat within yourself. And sometimes with depression like engaging with the world around us it's a big help you know so when you notice that you're getting kind of low. You know, like reach out to your friends talking with your friend and going to go hang out with your friends, you know, do something, or maybe play video games together like online or something like that. just sit down and give yourself a little bit of a boost. You know, in terms of how you're feeling. And then, also with depression, you know, like but. Whether you thinking about when you're depressed are you going to dark places are you."
15804.0,Patient,"very, very dark places. I die, I told you when we first started meeting that I used to be a very hateful person. So that ideology is still within me, you know homeless either thing. i'm not worth the air I breathe. Why am I here. Why does anyone care about me i'm not contributing anything i'm so those start bouncing around in my head and. I started having problems with just life in general, whenever those things are happening because it's like. Why does anyone, why should anyone care why."
759.0,Provider,Why should.
15804.0,Patient,"Anyone, why should anyone waste their time on."
759.0,Provider,"yeah well let's talk about some of those negative thoughts, you know for a moment, you know, like. Why should that, why should he be one care, you know anyone care about me and you know, like in replacing above you know kind of like. replacing it with what's the evidence for dot dot you know if that makes sense, you know the evidence does the evidence sign that. You know, in terms of why should anyone care about me, you know, like being me, you know, like i'm a person that's worth caring about. You know, like maybe it's what I bring you know, in terms of my personality, how I show up in the world, you know how i'm you know tried to make other people feel you know so just challenging those thoughts sometimes you know, like with counteracting them with positive thinking. And that takes time over over time you've learned how to do that, but I want you to when you start to think about some of those things you know really try to challenge your thoughts in a moment and it's okay to set your your thoughts as just thoughts because they're just thoughts. It doesn't mean necessarily that are true or not great weekend right, but the time. At the time the time."
15804.0,Patient,"it's really difficult to. deal with hindsight after i'm not in that progressive state it's really easy for me to go what the hell was I thinking, but then. You know I get back in Western states and the thoughts feedback in and I just can't go back to the whole you know hindsight i'm going to have and 2030 Minutes that you know why am I thinking that."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15804.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"I want you to push yourself, though in those in those moments it's not about changing because you also want this up how you're feeling like you're feeling depressed i'm feeling to pass I accept the fact. That i'm feeling depressed today we know by what can I do to bring up my mood if i'm starting to go to like those dark places where i'm starting to notice i'm thinking. A certain type of way about my myself to really, really push yourself in those moments to kind of challenge the dot. And you know, like I know it's hard, especially when you get into the you know, like that negative headspace to want to stay there, and want to. Know ruminate and not in that space, you know, like into allow yourself just said, go do it, you know, on. But sometimes you know, like carry acting those thoughts, you know with kind of like Okay, you know what's the evidence for down, you know why why to kind of challenge them a little bit. And then does take time so don't worry if you don't get it, you know, like this, these are new concepts, so you know, like i'm planting a seed. At least, and we can talk about it more i'm kind of planting seed with you that you know, like you can challenge those thoughts in those moments How does that sound does that sound like something. That you."
15804.0,Patient,"Can, to be honest it's going to be really difficult."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15804.0,Patient,But i'm always one for a challenge so i'm given a shot. I don't. i'm not gonna say that it's actually going to work but i'm.
759.0,Provider,We can only try right.
15804.0,Patient,huh. yeah so i'll give it a shot by me no guarantees about. yeah I was gonna work.
759.0,Provider,yeah and I know you said that you didn't really like journaling right.
15804.0,Patient,it's mostly my phone my phone saw.
759.0,Provider,Like a.
15804.0,Patient,It takes forever for the keyboard to come up it's it's one of the. lifeline free phones. yeah dumb.
759.0,Provider,Maybe.
15804.0,Patient,Like a journaling it's just really difficult on my device.
759.0,Provider,"Nice, do you like pin."
15804.0,Patient,Right now. i'm doesn't have any of that stuff it's. Really old tablet with. yeah i'm i'm.
759.0,Provider,Your technology. How you found about pen to paper.
15804.0,Patient,My handwriting is terrible I would make an awesome dog. What the heck i'm putting on paper. I ain't. writing the heck i'm putting on paper.
759.0,Provider,As you can be ready with your pen and paper.
15804.0,Patient,"Okay yeah so um what i'm probably going to do. Is i'm going to take my phone and delete some stuff off of it. and see if I can free up some memory and stuff like that. and see if I can get one of these Apps to work. Okay, because typically the Apps will work, but the documents dealt."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15804.0,Patient,"that's why you know I didn't really have a whole lot of detail, because I was going through my documents. mm hmm as opposed to an APP. I should have known that they had an APP for that you know there's an APP for literally everything under the sun, but. A match, you know me smile thinking."
759.0,Provider,"Well, I shouldn't have mentioned that last time too, but I wasn't thinking you know. i'm glad I thought about it this time i'm so like let him get on the APP and let's do that in the that might be helpful to you."
15804.0,Patient,"Okay, it should be more helpful yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so pen to paper is not going to help unless."
15804.0,Patient,"The paper is actually going to be a downgrade from what I. Like good Lord I come by it honestly my dad's handwriting i'm up in my dad's old office. And man his handwriting was awful too, so I I come by it honestly and my mom always gets after me it's like you should practice your handwriting it's like mom I practice my handwriting for like. 18 years in school and they never got any better what makes you think that's gonna get better now. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Okay. Well let's let's keep it simple for you like we're going to make them point hopefully get another point militia. You know the shirt So hopefully to put you on the calendar you'd like to discuss exactly how you feel so that's one of the interventions. And the other thing that we have on your treatment, you know plan is for you to do the mood tracker. And let's just make it goes to you for now. Because it sounds realistic. don't worry about dogs for now. You know, like, I want you to i'm planting the seed, meaning that something for you to think about. And we can explore and other sessions to but you know, once you just you know, briefly, when you when those start to come up. And why I want you to kind of like hear my voice and say Oh, maybe I should you know talent, some are think about it in a different way, you know, because sometimes we are what we're doing you know, like, and you know so kind of fire guard dogs are really huge to help me fill. So that's why I want you to start to challenge your thoughts and in a manner that you know, like can be helpful do a little bit of what we call cognitive behavioral therapy. So you know we'll discuss that a little bit more with you, you know I don't want to overwhelm you, I want to do what's practical for you that you can do daily okay."
15804.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,yeah and we'll keep it simple for right now.
15804.0,Patient,Keeping it simple for right now would be good. yeah i'm going from having no help whatsoever to actually having helped let's let's let's not overwhelming had me shut down.
759.0,Provider,yeah have you shut down and not do nothing. yeah now.
15804.0,Patient,"That that. i've been doing nothing for the past decade lot go back there, yes, not go back there yeah."
759.0,Provider,"And you should be proud of yourself for getting the help that you are getting right now. You know cuz is sometimes you know it could be easy for you just to say you know I fed, you know, like i'm just going to continue doing what i'm doing and whatever happens happens, but you're actually paying attention you're actually wanting to help you know so that's huge."
15804.0,Patient,So the thing is. it's like depression sucks I want help that way I don't frickin feel.
759.0,Provider,That way.
15804.0,Patient,"yeah the manic episodes who is like i'm not always going to have no no funds, I want to actually be smart with them as opposed to like you know i'll get on episode and just be like oh i'm just gonna blow my money, and now I don't have any money for rent and I get kicked. out my apartment.
