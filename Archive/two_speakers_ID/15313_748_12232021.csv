748.0,Provider,"Good morning. Good morning, how are you."
15313.0,Patient,Are you.
748.0,Provider,i'm okay. So. What brings you to our session today what's going on.
15313.0,Patient,"Well i'm required to be here. And I need medication so they're pretty strict about. My sessions. And, but i'm i'm depressed every day that doesn't change its worst some days and others, and today is a cloudy rainy day and it's even more depressing."
748.0,Provider,"So it sounds like you've been dealing with depression, a long time."
15313.0,Patient,"Yes, all my life."
748.0,Provider,well. and medication doesn't sound like it's doing what you would like it to do.
15313.0,Patient,"Is um it's keeping me on an even keel it's not. A can't solve my problems, it can only you know, keep me managed."
748.0,Provider,and treading water is not a great way to feel like you're living is that.
15313.0,Patient,No i'm not living i'm existing just from one day to the next.
748.0,Provider,So how long has it been like that.
15313.0,Patient,"And then, very long time since i'm. So, most of the stuff i've already told you so um is that will that be, what I do is I tell you the same thing each meeting."
748.0,Provider,I haven't seen you in in quite a while.
15313.0,Patient,yeah so. yeah and we've only seen each other once before.
748.0,Provider,"Before, and it was you're in a very different setting I barely recognized you."
15313.0,Patient,"i'm i'm moving because I lost my job, so I have to move, and I have a young son that's really struggling with this move. Oh, and that i'm forced to put a smile on my face as much as I can, that he he can tell he's 10 and he can tell that there's you know that I am not dealing with this well and so he's not going to deal with it well. And it just breaks my heart when i'm doing to him."
748.0,Provider,So were there no options for keeping out.
15313.0,Patient,"No, because I lost my job. When a single mom."
748.0,Provider,What about. The the pandemic. Putting your your mortgage on the whole.
15313.0,Patient,"I don't know I didn't hear anything about that, but I have my mortgage is very high, and my. My home is very large so we really need to move anyway it's just another it's just adds to more."
748.0,Provider,No more stress.
15313.0,Patient,"More stress i'm moving is i'm you know because I can't afford it, I couldn't afford it for a long time just holding on. And then, this losing my job just forced me to have to make other choices and. My son is struggling because it's the House that he was born and been in for 10 years and. he feels that he's losing his childhood when we leave this House he's grinding his teeth at night and can't sleep through the night and i'm. Just having nightmares he's crying and asleep. So i'm not sleeping because we're having share bed right now. i'm a single mom so it's i'm moving from this House by myself i've lived here for 16 years and there's a lot to do a lot to go through a lot to move. it's just it's just a lot and i'm. Still, the medication keeps me. From. Just laying in my bed and crying all day it does keep me from doing that, but it doesn't fully stop me from thinking of just. Ending my life."
748.0,Provider,And I know that that was one of the things that really stood out the last time we talked is how close you were to enjoying your one.
15313.0,Patient,"Yes, it was where it was worse before I went to the hospital and they got me on better medication, but the thoughts still crossed my mind."
748.0,Provider,"Sure, and one of the things that i'm really hearing is that, yes, there is the depression, which is the that huge blanket of sorrow or or flatness almost of. Like and hopelessness. But I also hear the huge grief walking through. and grief and depression are different. mean you're you're talking about letting go the place you've lived for 16 years the home that you've owned the place where you've raised your child that's a huge amount of grief in training. And it's also one of life's biggest stressors. So. Really cultivating some compassion for yourself and all that you're walking through. I know it's not easy."
15313.0,Patient,"No. it's not easy, I I can't. I don't feel compassion for myself, I do feel sorry for myself, sometimes, and then I kicked myself because. i'm in. A situation. Because. of choices that I made on how I spent my money and things like that so it's my. it's it's all on me it's not anybody else."
748.0,Provider,"What I hear is you're not giving yourself too much space to be human. You know, we make choices, often because of stressors and pressures and fears and we're trying to figure all those out inside of ourselves by ourselves, while we're still walking through stress and then later on blame ourselves for having made decisions that. That at the time were the best decisions, we could make. That doesn't mean they were great, but it was the best we could do with the time. I don't hear that you give yourself a lot of space to be human."
15313.0,Patient,"I don't I don't I just can't I just don't feel that. I don't feel. Like I should I don't I really truly don't feel like I can, or that I should I. I don't know I don't I don't know I wasn't raised to. To everything that. I don't know I I wallow in self pity and that's not Okay, but it goes hand in hand, I think, with giving myself permission to feel. Okay, with my choices, because I don't feel Okay, with my choices and nobody else. there's nobody else to take. Any part of the responsibility, but anybody not not a boyfriend not a friend not. A co worker not my ex husband not my children, nobody but me. Somebody has to take responsibility, somebody has to feel. Take the blame for the choices."
748.0,Provider,"Why does there have to be blame you're you're dealing with the consequences, I can understand. Step thing that you are where you are. and moving forward, from that point but adding know there's a philosophy, if you will. That a teacher that I liked very much her name is Tara Brock. br E br AC h. And that she uses a lot, and it is the first air it's the first arrow in the second year, so the first arrow that gets shattered us is the reality of our experience, so the reality of your experiences that you are in a position financially. Both as a result of circumstances you lost your job you couldn't control that. You couldn't control the pandemic. You certainly couldn't control them. And the history with your ex husband in. The. All of the ramifications of that situation, which were very painful. And and taking care of a young son on your own I mean that's huge all of that is real and it's like it hits us and stressed and we try to cope and deal with it. And then there's the second arrow that we shoot at ourselves of i'm not doing it right i'm not doing it well enough i'm not doing it fast enough, whatever it is, and and it's time for you to remove that second arrow and say I am human i'm in pain i'm doing the best I can."
15313.0,Patient,will try.
748.0,Provider,"Well, this isn't an assignment. Not one more thing i'm just feeling. i'm feeling broken. I wish I could take it away. Is there anyone in your life that is supported."
15313.0,Patient,"I have family they're not. There about an hour. away depending on traffic. And I have a friend that lives about an hour away and. that's it I don't have anybody. that's. That I can talk to face to face. You know, when I really need it."
748.0,Provider,makes so much difference. In the pan jamaica's masturbated. Are you in a growth. as well.
15313.0,Patient,"No. No i'm very confused on how this whole bright heart thing works I I get quite frustrated. The last time I was supposed to talk to you, which was on. The on the night. it's the second time that i've been disconnected so um I got disconnected on the ninth. And I waited for them to Rican i'm sorry."
748.0,Provider,On the ninth of December.
15313.0,Patient,"Yes, and then I waited to get reconnected and I never heard back from bright heart used to I would get either a phone call or an email or a text message. Prior you know either like the day prior to remind me or I would get one phone call the same morning to remind me, but I was on there waiting for you, on the night. And I got disconnected so I waited to hear back from someone and I didn't hear anything and that's not the first time that happened, the first time it happened was with with the. With the. Dominique."
748.0,Provider,The Perth driver.
15313.0,Patient,"Yes, and I got really upset over that one because that was the first time it happened and I thought I was gonna get you know, like in trouble and I got disconnected because on that one there was two Teresa burks and they had made an appointment for both of us, at the same time. And so, she I don't know I don't think it was Dr dominic I think that somebody. Having us in the waiting room or something didn't know which one of us was supposed to have the appointment, so we both got disconnected i'm assuming. And then, again I that one I I got very upset about that one because, like I said it was the first time and I thought oh my gosh i'm going to get blamed for this yeah you know i'm going to get to get charged and I didn't even talk to the doctor. Because there's a $50 charge every time I don't make my appointment, well then, I didn't miss one with Dr dominic which, because it was my fault that one was. On. That one was on December seven that when I did miss because it was 530 in the morning."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
15313.0,Patient,"And that's my fault, I did agree to a 530 in the morning, but then I overslept and didn't make that one so, but again I didn't get like a reminder, the day before the text or a phone call and I that's the first time I noticed I wasn't getting those anymore. So, and then all the compliance stuff that has to be done on email, so I get it get because i'm trying to move and Pack and do all this stuff and. I have to follow all jump through all these hoops with bright heart and I love talking to you and I love talking to Dr dominic but. The whole jumping through all the hoops they require is very frustrating, and I just recently got medical because i'm not working, because my regular insurance got canceled. So it, I still haven't heard back from them on whether they have approved it, I don't know if i'm being charged for today's session, I am not getting I don't know in the beginning, they were pretty quick to get back with me now I am waiting 45 minutes to get through the prescription. On the prescription zoom I don't 45 minutes is a long time for me to waste, just to get to tell them i'm out of medication."
748.0,Provider,That you have to sit and wait for 45.
15313.0,Patient,"And there's been other times i've waited so long that they close at four o'clock and then they shut off the thing and i've been sitting there waiting. So I just feel very frustrated with the whole bright heart. thing and I i'm hoping that since now I have medical i'm gonna try at some point I don't know when i'm in that free time but i'm going to try to find somebody local that I can see that's accepting patients. You know that's, not that I don't have to jump through all these hoops I mean I really like you and I really like Dr dominic I just all this other stuff is just adding to my stress."
748.0,Provider,"On it is it's very stressful. Certainly, you. know no question about it. varies. And you know I, I know that virtual clinic does the best it can and i'm not sure what the glitches are. But that is frustrating, and I just went back, while you were talking and looked at my calendar, and indeed it says that you showed up for the appointment on Monday."
15313.0,Patient,"Yes, I was there and it was like right before I would have expected you to come on, and then it was gone and I have no idea and like I said I waited for them to contact me to find out what happened and I didn't hear from anybody."
748.0,Provider,"And I. I don't have any memory or recollection of what happened, I I thought, well, I didn't know about that, but anyway, I am so sorry, you went through this so Sir."
15313.0,Patient,it's okay it's okay it's just it just.
748.0,Provider,fits them it's nobody's fault.
15313.0,Patient,necessarily it's just.
748.0,Provider,"Everything else this system is overwhelmed right now, because people are going through so much. In this this and now with this new. variant and what that's doing to people plans the the level of stresses increasing again it's just a very, very intensely painful time on this planet. And then, when you have your own personal intensity, on top of that, which is in your case and sadly in too many other cases so extreme it is, it is, as you said it, it takes everything to even get through the day and that's all you're doing."
15313.0,Patient,"yeah I do feel like I should have been completely finished packing by now and it's I just I can't do much because I feel so overwhelmed and so alone and so. I feel really alone. And weird and I feel like I have no help or I have support on the phone and I know people love me but I need something more than that, right now."
748.0,Provider,"We need it, we need flash we need connection I hear you."
15313.0,Patient,too. it's good to be.
748.0,Provider,"here. And I can tell you one holding you. do believe it is going to be okay, but I know that it's not the same as having actual arms around you and that place that you can rest your head and just solve. into somebody's shoulder."
15313.0,Patient,really nice.
748.0,Provider,"easy to say it's going to be okay, but it's not going to be okay today. And it's not going to be okay, tomorrow it, you may feel better tomorrow, you may feel better this afternoon I hope so, but there's still so much you're walking through. And one of my very favorite phrases i've used the sun much in the last year and a half, with the pandemic going on two years. And it. gets even more poignant Lee meaningful now because it's not always possible. But the for it, the the saying is we alone can do it, but we can't do it alone. And you're doing it alone."
15313.0,Patient,And I feel very alone.
748.0,Provider,"yeah I hear that so much. When you schedule I I what I just thought of is the best you know, this is the best I can do with I could be there in that that looks like you're in your closet."
15313.0,Patient,Because I try and my son to hear me.
748.0,Provider,"I know what I think you. I could be there in that with you physically, I will. And this may be the best I can do. It isn't maybe it is the best I can do, but I just hope that your scheduled, are you already scheduled for two weeks from now."
15313.0,Patient,So.
748.0,Provider,"I am going to i'm going to go back to where I was earlier and i'm still here with you, but I just want to check my schedule, because I am so book done so over book. And I will see. yeah. Okay. All right, um. So I want you to tell the virtual clinic and I will do this, do you know who your care navigator is."
15313.0,Patient,I keep getting different people.
748.0,Provider,"yeah you do keep getting different people but there. Is some person assigned. Oh, and you may not know who that is that's that's often the case."
15313.0,Patient,"No, I don't."
748.0,Provider,So I am going to go into your system. And I am going to. find out who it is and i'm going to reach out right now and make sure you get it scheduled. absolutely no idea what happened that.
15313.0,Patient,Know it's T.
748.0,Provider,Is T okay that's why I didn't pull it up. So your care navigator. Is Anna car bony. or carbone. Anna Maria carbone and I am going to. i'm going to message for right now.
15313.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,So that we get you.
15313.0,Patient,"Can I have you know, like 15 minutes of time. You know if that's all you can fit me in."
748.0,Provider,"carbonell. 15 minutes, no, I can do 30 minutes. Okay, but I really feel as though. I mean, unless you only want."
15313.0,Patient,"30 minutes, no, no, I was just trying to help you be able to fit me in."
748.0,Provider,"Well, because i'm booked. First and foremost i'm only part time with bright hurt. Because I have a private practice as well. But. January. All it's not want, yes, two weeks okay so. January six. And then the other thing I am going to do is, I am going to reach out to Dr domini. and see if it why you're not in a group Okay, because you would be in an hour long or once a week. and It seems to me that, having that would be helpful to being with other people. How does that sound to you."
15313.0,Patient,sounds kind of scary. i've never been in a group.
748.0,Provider,you've never been in a group.
15313.0,Patient,"And when I was in the hospital, it was a very small group, though it was a clinic and there was only they didn't force people to show up so sometimes there'd only be one or two other people in the group."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, well, these are. These are 15 minutes long and. there's usually not more than five or six people. You don't have to talk, at least not in the group side facilitate and I. I know i'm you know that the potential is there for you to check in and usually there's some kind of a theme for the group, some people use workbooks. Some people I i'll show a film clipboard quo door do a short meditation and then there's just a period of time for people to check in or focus on a skill, but but it's not high pressure. But it would give you some place to touch base each week."
15313.0,Patient,Okay that's that sounds fine.
748.0,Provider,"I would just really like to do have that be available to you, and it feels like. It feels like it might be really hope. yeah. i'm so sorry it's so hard so no one can anyone in your family an hour away come and help me Pack on the weekend or."
15313.0,Patient,They all have their own lives and honestly nobody's volunteering to help me. And because you know how I feel like it's all my fault I don't feel like I can even ask them and I don't and because they're not volunteering. They don't volunteer I don't feel like I can ask them.
748.0,Provider,Are you close closer to anybody in your family over other people.
15313.0,Patient,I only have one sibling and his wife that's. In California and then their kids their kids have little kids so they can't help me my brother. and his wife they're just they're just busy.
748.0,Provider,"that's fine to say that they're busy. To take. four hours, out of their wives one you."
15313.0,Patient,"Well, my house is not sold yet so I still have time it's just the bad part is for my if it happened quickly know if it had happened in you know. A couple weeks or even 30 days it wouldn't be this long long drawn out thing of my son staying in a house with me when I have him when it's my custody time. Then he stays with me and we're sleeping on a blow up bed and he's watching, as all his stuff gets packed up and some gets sold some gets given away some goes to his dad's House because none of it can stay here. And we're moving into a 26 foot trailer so he's been you know he goes into this we're living right now in a 3300 square foot house going to a 26 foot trailer and it's completely it's it's shocking for me it's Shell shock for me it's even worse for him."
748.0,Provider,Well it's awful for both of us it's challenging for both of you and it's challenging and. I had no idea.
15313.0,Patient,"All I can afford right now, and because i'm moving and it takes so much time to move I haven't had a chance to go look for another job i'm just. You know, everybody told me that my house is so beautiful it's going to sell so quickly it's not and I don't know if it's just because of the holiday season, because I put it on the market right before thanksgiving. or actually right. Right after Halloween I can't remember but it's all been during the holiday time so I can only hope that it's just the holiday season is why. i've had tons of people come look at it, but i've had no offers so, but you know, everybody says your houses. it's big it's beautiful it's going to sell so fast and not a single offer and it makes me feel sick in my stomach worrying about. You know I needed to sell so that I can move on with my life, so I can go get a job and get out of the trailer and everything is this can't happen until this happens and then that can happen until the next thing happens and. I can't I just can't move on i'm stuck in this. repetitive daily depression of not moving forward."
748.0,Provider,"And no my first thought is maybe the universe was making it possible for you to stay in the House, through the holidays."
15313.0,Patient,"there's nothing I mean I didn't put up a Christmas tree in the House or anything because i've been selling all my things so that I can put money in the bank. So we have no beds, we have no kitchen table with chairs, we have nothing, the House is empty, so I haven't we have no place to sit i'm sitting on the floor and my closet right now. One because I have no other place to sit and to it's only place because now there's nothing in the House everything echoes even though my son's way, on the other side of the House, he could hear everything I say if I didn't sit in my closet with all the doors closed."
748.0,Provider,"you're walking through. A lot of loss, a lot of change, a lot of letting go a lot of fear."
15313.0,Patient,"Well, at least i'm not paying as much as I was when i'm meeting first started."
748.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully, you are getting some of it out in your body and feeling the relief from that and and hopefully taking a big what gather your back that you were hanging yourself on the. blame and shame. What you're doing is one and."
15313.0,Patient,"Just. If it were just me. It would be better, but it's the watching. My son not sleep and watching. His sadness, he was always such a happy go lucky kid you could. Never nothing ever made him sad or he slept good every night now it just makes me sick it I can't do anything to stop him from grinding his teeth. and tossing and turning and waking up and crying and I just. that's more than I can handle most day is especially when it's during the time that I have custody of him, which is right now."
748.0,Provider,When does he go to his father's.
15313.0,Patient,He goes back to his dad on Monday. We have to we do two weeks on two weeks off.
748.0,Provider,When. Does his dad his dad not willing to help in some way.
15313.0,Patient,"i've been talking to him repeatedly with trying to not put pressure on him because, if I pressure him he just. Plans up. But um, I would like to find I mean i've already found someone for my son to talk to, but I need the cooperation of his dad. because I feel that that my son is he my son doesn't want to tell me, this is why I think he's so burdened and he can't sleep is because. He is so sweet he doesn't want to tell me that he's upset at me for selling the House, he doesn't want to tell me that he's. That he's sad he doesn't want to tell me that he's hurt or mad or he doesn't want to tell me anything so he just keeps it all inside and then comes out at night when he's trying to sleep, but I know that I can tell. That he's terribly depressed and sad and he makes passing comments to his friends and says we're losing our House we're not i'm not losing the House i'm still making the mortgage payment on it, I but he's 10 he doesn't understand the difference between. losing the House and selling the House."
748.0,Provider,he's losing.
15313.0,Patient,"He is he feels like he's losing everything he feels like he's losing all his memories he feels like he's, and this is his words. he's losing his his memories he's losing his childhood, but he won't say mom i'm upset at you or mom you know why did you make those bad choices and get us in debt and mom you know he won't say that but. But I can't I don't know how to help him feel better I don't know how to that's what I need him to be able to talk to somebody that has better suggestions on what to say to him. But I got it, I have to get."
748.0,Provider,"neutral, who can receive it without him feeling guilty."
15313.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly."
748.0,Provider,"And also somebody. Who can support you, by being there for him. son what he needs to be able to talk to you. Yes, and he may be a little angry at his dad too."
15313.0,Patient,"He he. He knows that his dad helps me with things you know if I have to if there's something I can't fix or there's something that I can't move because it's too heavy. But that's very few and far between that he's comes to do anything with I understand he's in that it's the way it should be he's remarried and if I was his new wife I wouldn't want. My husband going over to my ex wife's House all the time, you know doing I completely understand that, but I think that. That he still an even though it's been almost seven years, my son still set makes comments about I wish we were still a family. And he was three or four. So, but yet he still remembers us as a family."
748.0,Provider,And what he's really saying is I wish that we were still safe I wish that we weren't in so much. intensity.
15313.0,Patient,and
748.0,Provider,that's because really your husband was not there when he was.
15313.0,Patient,"Right. He know his dad and his new wife, they. They have a pretty. easy life, from what I can see, and so maybe my son feels like it's not right that dad has it, you know so easy and moms struggling. it's it's not his dad's fault that you know, things are the way they are right now it's just. i'm i'm grateful for their help when they give it to me so i'm."
748.0,Provider,that's a wonderful. thing. could show.
15313.0,Patient,I love him I know he loves me just. I don't know I don't know why nobody volunteers to help me pack I don't know. So you said I wrote down. So your message or you're going to message my care navigator about the January six.
748.0,Provider,I already did.
15313.0,Patient,"Okay, is there a particular time I should write down."
748.0,Provider,"And that will be just like the two days it'll be 15 minutes. Okay yeah i'm back to back, so I do need to have that 10 minutes in between. Sure, especially because sometimes I have to half hour appointments and then I don't anyway that's not your problem. But right yes. So. The sixth at 11am and then hopefully you'll be on the schedule. By the time when when she or whomever schedules that first appointment, I requested that they go every two weeks."
15313.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you. Okay."
748.0,Provider,"So that and they may only do two or three. About will check in and make sure, each time you and I meet so that it set up and."
15313.0,Patient,"that's good yeah because they've been relying on me. To call and make the appointments. And I get busy, and I forget, and the only time I remember to contact bret Hart is when i'm out of medication."
748.0,Provider,"yeah and you know, one of the things that would make that easier is if you're in their group. Okay, I know meeting with your doctor is also a part of it, but when you're in a group there's a prescriber in the group to."
15313.0,Patient,Oh okay.
748.0,Provider,"And so they can also check in and probably what would be. What they would try to do is get you in a group with Dr Dominique. I may not, I have a group that would be I think a good fit for you, but, and I think their space in right now, and I will check in about that as well, but I don't know what your schedule is or what would work best for you and the care navigators can figure that out with Dr Dominique. Okay, maybe she's got a group that will be a good fit. OK, and then you just have a different therapist and."
15313.0,Patient,Okay sounds good yeah.
748.0,Provider,"That you deserve that support that extra support an hour a week a time, you can look forward to to just kind of decompress and release here other people who are going through anxiety and. loss, and you know it's it is, it is so easy when we are walking through challenges to see ourselves as the problem. As opposed to it sounds really hard to live on Planet Earth. And we're all doing the best we can. And you're not a failure. you're not a failure. you're a human being. And you are walkable and you deserve."
15313.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,I want you to give yourself a big hug tonight i'm really because maybe take a bath do something for yourself searing.
15313.0,Patient,My trailer doesn't have a bathtub.
748.0,Provider,"i'm sure it doesn't, which is why I want you to do it, while you're still in."
15313.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,"yeah that was one of the first things I thought of is you know who knows how many weeks of bad's will be available to you for a while and you won't be in the trailer forever, but it's going to be a hard move. Will you be with your brother for Christmas."
15313.0,Patient,"supposed to be, and then one of his family members Scott coven. So I think now it's cancelled, which is going to be I haven't even had the heart to tell my son yet, because that means that he and I will be stuck alone together in the 26 foot trailer. He asked you know how santa's gonna get deliver their presence and. there's no chimney and you know the things that 10 year old boys are still asking at least some 10 year old boys still believe in Santa."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, he needs Santo right he needs to believe in magic."
15313.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,deserves to believe in magic.
15313.0,Patient,Right.
748.0,Provider,"All of you. So do you know. Things can change in an instant they don't all the time, but they came. And it could be that that will happen for you, in the meantime, you are doing everything you're supposed to do to walk through this. And you know I don't know if you ever go on any social media or even have time, probably not, but there are lots of means, these days, saying things like I don't want to be told I am strong and resilient ever again, I just want my life to get."
15313.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And i'm telling you that, because I know it fits for you and also because the person that wrote that mean didn't know. What that does for me when I read that is wow there are a lot of us walking through this right. It is a hard time on Planet Earth. So. If I could ask you to do anything every day for the next two weeks, it will be every time you hear a voice that blames new or criticizes you or uses that phrase, this is because of your decisions tell that voice to be quiet. You deserve love support in compassion you're a human being. doing the very best chicken. Another phrase i'll give you that I really love if we knew better we do better. When we make the mistakes we make we're doing the best we can. Sometimes learning from them is excruciating Lee painful, but you are. And that takes courage. So do you promise to give yourself a hug."
