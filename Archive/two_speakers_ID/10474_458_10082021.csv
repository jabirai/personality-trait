458.0,Provider,"Okay, so we actually have."
10474.0,Patient,Not gotten the order.
458.0,Provider,"yeah so we have a contract. With quest and what you have to do is, you have to actually physically go there and ask them to check their national database i'll resend the lab. I have the. capability of doing that, if you have a place to refer like a hospital lab that you can walk into i'm happy to send it wherever as long as you give me the box number um. But we're at a point where we have to get that done or we need to or we're probably just not a good fit for each other, you know what I mean like the program might not be a good fit."
10474.0,Patient,"No questions fine I just. Okay, every time Father they've said they don't have orders from you guys, so I haven't made the appointment because they said they don't have it from you."
458.0,Provider,"Okay, so most most of the locations you shouldn't need an appointment, you can just walk right in. and call us if they say they don't have the lab because we can send it again electronically it's like an instant. Maybe two minute transfer for the lab to show up there, so just go to a lab and if, and if they don't have the lab. or hall so listen leave there until they have it okay. Because it's pertinent at this point. So what i'll do with you right now so then i'm. i'm going to have also do you want me to send you the link to the care group or you want me to just have that be sent in the confirmation email."

But you picked it up on the first so today's day seven day seven so mark was going to consult with the other pharmacist, to see if you could get it today, or if it was going to be tomorrow I left that totally up to them, I did not give them any. So whatever however they handle it is, however, they handle it um what which hospital, did you say that you went to when you got in the car accident."
10474.0,Patient,It was mansfield.
458.0,Provider,mansfield hospital okay. And then also if you could go ahead and that that link that I sent you it actually it's you can use it multiple times it's reusable. So if you could also fill out a release of information for a nurse. practitioner delaney. i'll look out for that one as well okay.
10474.0,Patient,Okay.
458.0,Provider,"it's just continuity of care i'm. Just gonna make sure we just need to make sure that all of your doctors are communicating otherwise I mean we're not really doing you much good. So. So we'll see you Monday for the care. group at 4pm. I need you to fill out the releases of information, one for the hospital and one for delaney. And then get your labs done, let me know if you need the lab sent to a hospital instead of the quest but like I said I sent it again two questions today."
10474.0,Patient,Okay that's.
458.0,Provider,"Okay. Yes, already, and you have my number, if you need me."
10474.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
458.0,Provider,"Thank you reena. be well. Raina waldorf 822 to 851 Pacific Center time last dose of medication, which is buprenorphine suboxone eight dash two sublingual films was today, she reports, she has none left on hand. She has been. delinquent with her attendance she will be seen on Monday for care group or or face potential not getting potentially not getting a refill. A two day supply with one additional refill was called in for her to her normal pharmacy of discount drug Mart. pharmacist mark a discount drug Mart had the same exact story, as the pharmacy before. discount drug Mart the patient continues to pick up one day early I left it up to the pharmacy whether or not they would dispense to the patient today, which would technically be one day early. The pharmacist also reported to me that patient is seeing a nurse practitioner delaney and quote delaney gives them whatever they want. Is what the pharmacist, said to me she's getting pregnant zone and cycle benza pain from the from nurse practitioner delaney. Patient reports a car accident on Saturday I just heard of reef to fill out a release of information for both mansfield hospital who treated her as well as for delaney nurse practitioner, I will advise the prescriber that. Have a mean honestly, it seems like discharge is most appropriate at this point because the patient is seeing another doctor or nurse practitioner that. Is quote doing the same things you guys do PR mark pharmacist at discount drug Mart patients should get labs done before Monday, otherwise a daily dosing will happen until the patient gets a labs done per me. know but no further action is needed at this time, patient does not report any relapses or withdrawal symptoms of this time. and Happy Friday."
