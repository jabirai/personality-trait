528.0,Provider,"hi Tina. hi hi sorry for the delay, I got hold up with another client."
11651.0,Patient,No problem.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, have you been."
11651.0,Patient,"i've been mostly good the last few days have been pretty challenging though the last. Two three days have been kind of difficult but, overall, mostly good."
528.0,Provider,what's been what's been going on the last couple days.
11651.0,Patient,"um so like. i'm. Andrew and I are starting to kind of just uncover some stuff that i'm holding on to with my mom. Okay, and so it's just bringing stuff to the surface that's like really uncomfortable and and. And i've been like. pretty much Okay, with all of that, because it's like it's really nothing new like i've had. me having issues with my mom internally is like nothing new. But I have this moment on. Sunday Sunday. yeah I think it was Sunday, I made a note of it, it was Sunday. And I what was I doing. I was just working on some homework and. I had this realization. Of like how I let what I think my mom thinks of me. dictate how I treat myself and how I treat my relationships with other people. hmm and realized like. And the hard thing about it is like. I see how absurd and childish is but just but knowing how chocolate doesn't make it go away. And kind of makes it more difficult to like get out of it it's like. Because, then I start to feel shame myself for feeling, you know. yeah um but. I had texted. My mom. The weekend before last, because, like. i've been sharing with Andrew like. You know I well why isn't she like want to call me and like when we when we do like agreed to talk to each other. The last couple times like it was a few months ago gosh it's been more than a few months now, I think, but. She had texted me and she was like hey I think we should catch up, when I was like yeah that'd be great how about this weekend and she was like yeah Okay, and that was earlier in the week and then it was. A Saturday and I had. called her and she didn't answer so I left a voicemail and then I sent a text like saying hey I just tried calling you and I know we didn't like plan a specific day or time or anything for the weekend, but I figured I try to. hear back from her for like two days and she was like oh sorry we just got busy, and I was like well that's Finally, we can just do another time. yeah and we just never did and. Then yeah so the weekend before last I. expect contacts have an extremely spread and we haven't had a falling out or anything, there was no fight I don't so I don't even know what what it is. Okay um. But like. I would have been sharing with Andrea like while. i'm sitting here wallowing in my shit thinking like oh my mom is one talk to me about love, but then i'm like well what am I doing like how much of an effort, am I, making to like try to make a connection. Okay, so I don't really have room to complain, I could at least try."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"And so I, so I tested that last week the weekend before last and sent her and my step daughter group texting like hey miss you just thinking about you love you whatever, and that was on a Sunday and I didn't hear back from her until Monday and she sent me a text saying like. Oh so we're on our way back home from camping and I was like oh cool where'd you go and she told me like where they want, and I was like oh that's Nice and. You know just was trying to engage a conversation and I didn't get a response back and so i'm like what the Fuck and like. What stirring me up about it so much is because I, this is not the first time that i've like done work around like my how I feel about my mom and everything and like she. So she so she was really young when she had me so like you know I have like she never physically hurt me or anything like that, but she was really like. Like detached. from me and. She don't she don't want to be a mom and so. that's kind of the bond that we had and. But my needs were met. And so. I like it's obvious it's like yeah she was a child raising a child, so of course like."
528.0,Provider,I say.
11651.0,Patient,"there's going to be a notional but. So, like I it's easy to see that and accept that, from the past."
528.0,Provider,But like.
11651.0,Patient,"No i'm seeing this shit happening now, and like she doesn't need to like. buy my groceries cut my dinner she like I don't feel like i'm asking for very much at this point, and she can't even like give me even what little and asked me have right now, which is like some maybe, maybe even just like a once in a month conversation or connection of some kind. yeah and it's like I don't know. Like I know I didn't do anything so i'm just like she doesn't want me i'm not i'm unwanted. And so on Sunday. Last Sunday, while i'm doing my homework it just. It just hit me like a ton of bricks. mm hmm hit me like a fucking ton of bricks and and I realized like because I still push people away, and I still have a hard time like. nurturing the close relationships that I do have, I think all that the people that I am close with understand so they're patient with me and they don't hold it against me if I would kind of isolate for a while. So I, so I have good relationships, but I still. i'm not the kind of friend that I want to be to the people, my life because I still. Have these attachment issues and these abandonment issues of like don't get too close because they're going to leave you. Even though the people in my life today have shown me like. they're still here."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11651.0,Patient,"And I think a lot of it has more to do with less less of like friendship stuff but more like romantic relationship stuff and like you know it's like a normal human desire to like want to have a conflict, like a life partner and like. You with someone and. And, like the last romantic relationship, I was in. I still struggle getting over and it's been like it's been a few years since we broke up and like i'm mostly mostly overall like over it, but I still have these moments, where I have, I have to like get over it again. hmm and and I think this the last one is the hardest to get over because. I actually was going to be okay with getting married to this person one like before I was like I hope i'm not going to get married to anybody, why would you marry someone like it's just if you want to deal with some dispute with them, but like you don't need to get married that's stupid. Like what those personal was like no actually I had actually get married to you because, like you want marriage and I want to be with you, so if that's what you want, like i'm happy to. So when that relationship ended, it was just like. holy shit like my world just completely went inside out and. And so on Sunday, it was just like. All of your relationships had failed because, why would anybody want to be with you, when your own mother doesn't even want you. know it was just like that kind of thing that just like hit me and I just like. bawling my eyes out and. And I know that's irrational I know that's not true, but it's it doesn't change that I. That my perception is rooted in that belief."
528.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"And i'm. So so then it's been going on. That day i've been there a date, and I did an opinion, yesterday I didn't log it, but I did been yesterday, and I wanted to bring up late, because I know we had a conversation in the past how. I brought up my concern was like you know. Food and addiction like food can be an addiction and you shared with me a different perspective and a disagreement on that and and i'm concerned about that again because I noticed this in the last two days when I when I had binged again I went straight for like sugar stuff and I realized. It was totally black and white obvious like I was feeling pain, I was feeling emotional pain and I wanted to get out of it. yeah and I wanted a rush, and I wanted a high, and I want you. To for like highly palatable sugar stuff. Right and I did feel like a heightened sense of like pleasure and an elevated not a mood and really get rid of the emotions, but like there was some kind of. elevation that happened within myself. And then, of course, like it just crashed, because you know. So I thought that, so I brought that up because i'm I saw how I just use sugar those same way that I use drugs and alcohol."
528.0,Provider,Okay okay.
11651.0,Patient,And uh. yeah um. But I mean like like it's been mostly all right since last to me talking sentence like his last his last like two or three days we're just like.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I mean i'm glad you've been okay up until. This point you know I mean because it's been I can't even remember the last time I saw you I feel like it's been two weeks or three weeks."
11651.0,Patient,um yeah.
528.0,Provider,"I know we missed. I don't know I can't remember, I think I feel like it's been three weeks, possibly um. So, if things have been going well for the most part, you know, for that length of time, like you know it's that's pretty good as what i'm saying you know, like that that's great you know and actually good thing we're meeting today. You know you're having a more challenging week it sounds like this week."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah and. The last session I have Andrea also she had she had asked me about. Like what I know about like my mom's drug use an alcohol use and. And I share with her like a lot of what I could remember and then some of what like my dad had open up to me about. Since i've become an adult and and I don't think my dad is like Tommy anything to try to like make make me not like my mom or anything but he's like. you're an adult no and you deserve to know like what was going on, so i'm just this is something that happened when you were this age and you probably don't remember it, but like that's you know that's what was going on. And so I shared a lot of that stuff with her and. Another thing that came up was like. Like I feel so not even just like the sense of like unworthiness and i'm wantonness by others, but also like anger towards my mom in that like. it's like well. Of course, you would have been selfish when she was raised me as a kid because she she was so young, so like it like it wouldn't. If she was like a selfless nurturing maternal type at the age of like 19 and 20 and like that would be the outlier. yeah but now you know she's like almost 50 it's like. you're still being selfish."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11651.0,Patient,"And and. So I just so there's like anger towards her too, and I yeah so, but when she she had asked me some stuff about that on our last session, and so it just brought so much stuff to the surface. hmm and so i'm not surprised that I had like. kind of like a little bit of an emotional breakdown on Sunday, because of it. was just like. Coming up and and it was necessary, like I haven't cried like that in a really, really long time so I mean as uncomfortable as it was was so like I said getting out."
528.0,Provider,slowly.
11651.0,Patient,You know i'd rather not.
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11651.0,Patient,No for sure my Sunday crying my eyes out.
528.0,Provider,"But in in it sounds like. You know, as difficult as it was it sounds like you were actually like feeling your feelings, you know, like instead of just. You know checking out or I don't know what you would have done in the past, like it would you have you are you normally like kind of in touch with your feelings in that way, or do you kind of have you tried to disconnect."
11651.0,Patient,"it's the first time, so I binge after that. So I felt feelings and I have the cry and I, but before like when I first started getting back into therapy. Last year in 2020. And I had I had slipped again was like my binging and purging in the fall and my therapist at that time had asked me like. So. Before you like start bingeing she doesn't she wouldn't even ask that the purge because the purging is like shame, from the beginning, so she would ask me about like what led up to the bingeing because I wouldn't purchase you know. yeah courage from up bingeing so she asked me like what's going on within. Myself psychologically and emotionally and what kind of behaviors Am I engaging in and what's going on my own environment before I have a binge and I couldn't answer that question because I was so. I was completely automatic to numbing myself to the point that I didn't even know what was going on, it felt, just like I just binge because I binge I don't know what you're talking about so um So this was like one of the first times that I like actually. Really felt something. And not just like subconsciously numbing myself before I could even be conscious of having an emotion. So, so no i'm not used to doing that."
528.0,Provider,"yeah so that's I mean I. I don't know if you can see it this way, but I see that as you know, that's progress, you know I mean I know it feels uncomfortable to feel your feelings, but it's that's part of recovering right it's like being able to feel the feelings and be able to tolerate like it, you know I mean. I know it's not tolerable, but you are tolerating it by feeling it, you know, in a sense. And you know, yes, you did you know binge afterwards, but like. You know, again that's you could have done that, and not like had you know cried dries out, you know not felt anything and just try to like numb out and disconnect and not even like dealt with it, you know. But, so I feel like that that's I don't know if you can see it that way, but I feel like that that's an improvement."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah no I I. I can see it that way it's just like. It feels like i'm. I mean yeah progress and that I am actually allowing myself to like sit was an emotion, for a period of time. And not completely numb out by using you know drugs or alcohol. yeah um because, even with food like. It does change the way, I feel, to a certain extent, but i'm still aware."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"yeah it's like you know, using drugs and alcohol i'm. Shutting my consciousness off grade."
528.0,Provider,Right all right.
11651.0,Patient,"So yeah no, it does. yeah I do see it as growth. fucking hurts."
528.0,Provider,i'm so sorry.
11651.0,Patient,Like her.
528.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I mean. And I wonder, too, like you were talking about like going towards the sugary stuff like it kind of gave you like a almost like a high kind of felt like a rush or like some kind of. You know and that's like the dopa mean effect basically like that's what's that that feeling that reward kind of feeling like that, like feel good feeling right. um and you know I mean and and I wanted, I want to make sure you know that I know it feels like you're addicted like. Because i've talked to so many other clients who say like i'm addicted to this food, you know, like, I think that that's that it is a like it is a real feeling like you feel like you can't stop or that it's something you have to have kind of right. I mean I don't know what would you say is like makes you feel like you're addicted to it like, why do you choose that word."
11651.0,Patient,"and choose it because it's because of my having my experience with like. Like alcoholism and drug addiction, where it feels like almost the same like my behaviors are similar. around it and my sense of like me my false sense of need, for it is similar. Not quite to the same degree as desperation, as it was with drugs and alcohol were like. i'm not gonna. I never prostituted myself or anything but like. I probably would because it never got to that point, but like I I wouldn't put it past myself if you know if I didn't get sober when I did I probably would have done something like that, because in my in my mind like knowing what it was like. Being. In the in the grasp of addiction it's like yeah I would have done that, if. The circumstances warranted it, you know it makes sense to me, knowing that kind of thinking, whereas like i'm not going to like. Get on my knees in front of some dude for like a candy bar."
528.0,Provider,So it's not it doesn't have some.
11651.0,Patient,"level of desperation. Right, but it does have the same level of like. I need it and i'm incapable of being functional without it."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"You know, like I can't function until I get it."
528.0,Provider,Right.
11651.0,Patient,And then put it in me and then okay now i'm ready for whatever so it has a similar.
528.0,Provider,"drive or something for. But yeah I get it um so what, and this is what I was, I think we talked about last time is I mean what like what a lot of the research shows is that. That feeling like you're addicted is actually it actually comes from like. deprivation, so, in other words. Like the less the more you deprive yourself of that food. The more the stronger that effect is that makes sense. So, in other words. Like one way that I mean i'm not saying this is going 100% like here are the situation, but like just we're just talking about this i'm not saying you have to do any of us, but like i'm. Like one thing you, you might be able to do is incorporate some like high sugar foods into your day intentionally like not purpose. Like not in a. Like while we can talk about how that would look but. You know I mean whether or not you'd be able to tolerate that level like a small amount, you know it's not like i'm saying go, you know binge on these foods every single day, but like. An intentional amount each day, where it starts to become normalized. So, because, like it's interesting that now sugar might have a different effect of them like let's say chicken right bomb, but if you were to like tell yourself I can't eat chicken or just takes chicken out of your diet. chances are at some point, you might I mean I know this might sound kind of like you might be like what are you talking about, but like. Like chances are i'm not saying you would binge on chicken, but you might land up like. overeating on chicken at some point or it could be anything i'm just using that as an example, like because that's that that tends to be what happens with. With people like with all foods like if you if you omit something from your diet. Like the second you put it back in it's like very normal to kind of overdo it, and it doesn't even have to do with food you take like. I don't know you take sex out of your diet you, you know you may be able to do that you take. I don't know you take fun out of your diet you overdo that you know your life, you know it doesn't matter what it is like anytime you like restrict yourself from something like that tends to be the like the opposite effect. um so I don't know i'm kind of curious what you're thinking as i'm saying all this, but like one possible way to start overcoming this is to actually intentionally bring this food into your life like on purpose but."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah and I remember the last time we saw each other that you had brought up like the mental deprivation, because I remember like saying something you like. i'm benjy on it i'm not depriving myself i'm over and don't shake."
528.0,Provider,yeah yeah even like.
11651.0,Patient,"The mental deprivation, which I was like Okay, I made sense and like I. I see where you're coming from i'm it's terrifying i'm i'm open to it and what's it's just terrifying because, like how long i've just categorize like refined sugary dessert items as like like satan's food or something you know and."
528.0,Provider,Just yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"And also, also in my mind it's just like. Well, what purpose does it serve because it's not really like giving me any like beneficial nutrients and and I want to be like and I guess with my eating disorder. it's disgusting like in my mind, which is. Because i'm bingeing so it's just I don't know but with my eating disorder like in my mind is disgusting to me it's like want to like engage and pleasure through eating food. The idea of that like is really disgusting to me. But then again like hearing i'm like sitting here like bingeing everyone saw on this stuff that I would like I don't even. Just things that I would don't even like, if I were to be in a place right now comfortably incorporating like like sweet things like that in my life. I would rather not be the things i've been john i'd rather be like you know, like home like just not process stuff too like something homemade you know, like natural like that's what I rather incorporate um. and So that's something like i'm open to and. it's just but yeah my brain is like well it doesn't serve a purpose will function for your body, it doesn't make any sense and. But it does from what you're telling me, you know, so this like I have this complete like dichotomy in my brain, just like going this way in that way in this. area and it's and they're complete opposite perspectives and it's like."
528.0,Provider,"yeah. Little it sounds like you can kind of see both sides. And you don't even know what to think, in a sense."
11651.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah and that's like and I figured like oh so the Nice like. using sugar or whatever. I wish that I could just use fruit is that. You know, like. Like can I would just rather have like fruit be my candy or something like that, because it is sweet, and it does have sugar and it is natural, and it also does have like nutritional value to it also like if i'm if i'm using i'm eating fruit, why would I need like. You know, like baked goods or something like why Why is fruit not fulfilling that you know."
528.0,Provider,"yeah well, let me ask you this, I mean have you. Can you remember a time or Just imagine if you had a craving for a cookie or something or I don't know what's your favorite kind of dessert like processed like kind of. The whole word processed is a whole other thing that i'll talk, we can talk about another time but like just any kind of dessert or sweet like not fruit, but what's your favorite."
11651.0,Patient,"um. See like when i'm thinking about them i'm it's like it doesn't sound appealing to me. Like no. I get I don't know like maybe. Well, I like chocolate. I used to work in a bakery when I was in server living as like a brief this i'm trying to remember, like the things that we had that I liked. And i'm trying to think like is that actually like your favorite sweet thing. i'll just say, like a cookie."
528.0,Provider,"What this is so interesting that. it's you are really having a hard time like choosing a food or like deciding or figuring it out, and I wonder, I don't know it's making me wonder why that is, I guess."
11651.0,Patient,"Well, because i'm thinking like i'm thinking of the things that we used to have in the bakery and that I tried and I liked them but they're like when I. i'm trying to think of like favorite. Okay, not really like. there's not something that's like. Oh yeah that thing was nice but no, this is like the best like nothing sticks out specifically."
528.0,Provider,Okay let's maybe like lower the bar like it doesn't have to be your favorite but something you enjoy.
11651.0,Patient,Okay um. I guess like a piece of cheesecake.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, and when was the last time you had that."
11651.0,Patient,it's been maybe. Maybe about. A year.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's a long time um that you've had something that you. enjoy like a sweet kind of food. Or has there been other things that you enjoy that you've had ever you know sometime between."
11651.0,Patient,That I usually deprive myself of.
528.0,Provider,"That you just yeah then maybe you deprive yourself of or that like. That or that you eat up I don't know, have you eaten any like sweets I don't mean bingeing on sweets I just mean like as part of like. How like I want to say this, like as part of them. Like in terms of like normal eating kind of way, not in a binge. That make sense."
11651.0,Patient,Like the last time I had something like.
528.0,Provider,"Like you just had a piece of cheesecake or you just had a cookie and it was Okay, you know, like, I wonder when was the last time you had something like that an experience like that."
11651.0,Patient,"um geez it's been because that because that 12 step program doesn't. yeah um. it's been. Oh Okay, there was. Last December. I had. I had quit that 12 step program for a period of a few months and I. there's two women that I know from from a. Until our. Our lives got just insanely busy we were meeting like maybe once a month or once every two months, just like doing dinner at one of their apartments and it was December, and one of my clients had. They she and her family baked a bunch of cookies and so like they sent home. They gave me a small bag of cookies and they also do the other beauty and small bag of cookies that they baked and so. That was on. A Tuesday. And so later that night we had dinner plans on my friend's house, so I just brought the bag, because it was like those bag and i'm like if I take us home going to eat, all of them, so like wanted to bring them over to dinner and share them and I ate one of them. With them like in a dinner setting and. So that was last summer and then. before that. was probably before I joined that FA program so it was probably back in those back in 2018. Okay um. I want to say. Maybe like. Maybe late October early November of 2018. mm."
528.0,Provider,"hmm okay so eating like sugary foods is not really a part of your routine. I mean you've had like one in a year like one and. Again, in a normal way, not in a binge way like right because you've been on these foods. Correct like you've had them when you binge but you're. But not like without a bench. Okay um and you know one thing, as you were talking of just kind of thinking to I wonder i'm curious what you think of this, I wonder if, like. Because you think of them as bad like something I don't know you think of them as bad foods right or things you should have be avoiding is that right."
11651.0,Patient,"I think about them like this is gonna sound like really weird but it's probably nothing you haven't heard before. Okay, so like i'm i'm a spiritual person and a I feel like that's probably pretty obvious and I don't need to like explain why or whatever, but so when I think about like how I want to take care of my body, I think about like well. i'd rather take care of it in a natural organic way and the earth has been the earth has provided us with everything we need without us coming in and like manufacturing all this weird shit like our bodies don't need those things so like why. You know it didn't exist for a long period of time, while humans are here on this planet and thriving I mean. die terribly Okay, we didn't really have like medicine or anything like it evolved medicine, but like as far as like eating food it's like. The food that we need is all here like it comes from the ground and like it walks on for like that's what I need, so why. So yeah I want to be able to take care of my body like in a spiritual way. in a natural way. And so, like thinking about like. stuff like that, like it doesn't grow natural it's it's it's unnatural to me, so it just doesn't make sense."
528.0,Provider,"So does bingeing on those foods make sense to you. Okay. So you do do things that don't make sense, you know with food right, like you, are doing things that myth don't really make sense. Even though you would like it to be different like you think you need to eat foods that are more natural and don't contain sugar or process and things like that. Like yeah so um I don't know what do you think about that kind of. what's the word i'm. Having a thing with words today I like on my time, but I can't like that I guess difference, you know the you know that, like. Well, how you would like to be taking care of yourself and eating in a way that's you have a certain idea of how you want to be feeding your body is actually different than like what is happening right. So, I guess, I wonder kind of what you make of that."
11651.0,Patient,"Like do something that had come to my mind, over the weekend was. When I had that like that cry episode and was like. Oh, like no one wants you, because even you're you're you're not you're not worthy and you're not good enough to be wanted, because even your own mother like once this is repulsed by you so like. No one's going to want to be with you, even though, like. This is a fucking conceited but like. Even though I haven't. Out of all the times that like i've i've approached like men and stuff like that or put up males like. and hardly been rejected. i've been pretty much. Given consent. Like mutual consent anytime have approached anybody. i've been. In a relationship with all the people that I was interested in exploring relationship with i've i've hardly been rejected in that. sense. So I know like and when I was in my early 20s like in college I knew that I could leverage like my parents to get things that, like, I understand, like i'm attractive, but I don't believe I am, but I understand that I am based on like. How i've used it before and. So with like the benji and stuff like that, over the weekend, when I had this realization is like. I think it's a way for me to, I think I put it in one of the notes to that it's like a self fulfilling prophecy will like. i'm actually not that repulsive, but let me make myself repulsive so that I actually am that way, so I can I can. I can make myself the way that I see myself."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11651.0,Patient,So I think there's kind of like a. Like I don't think I wanted or worthy. And so i'm going to make myself. more repulsive. We are my actions and the consequences that result for my actions.
528.0,Provider,"yeah so it's almost like. A way to heart, like, I see it as like a it's like a hallway to harm yourself."
11651.0,Patient,"Yes. Exactly yeah it's. Because I I might have mentioned this to you earlier, but like when I when I first started having like. Body image issues to the point where like when I was 14 and stuff like that I started engaging and cutting in like self mutilation and like it was it was it was so correlated with with my my body image issues and my eating and. So I. You know i'm not cutting myself I haven't caught myself in in years but it's still. But I haven't fully healed up part of myself and I think it's the same thing just coming out. Less violently, but in a different way."
528.0,Provider,"yeah well actually I just kind of I just thought of something it's it's like you know you were talking about kind of viewing food certain foods is like been. beneficial or you know sort of not these like processed foods are more harmful you don't view them as natural and I mean i'm going to take a guess and I don't think you use the word harmful but i'll i'll maybe guess that that's what you're thinking they're not. good for you. yeah so it's sort of like okay you're using this thing I mean it's food that you think is not good for you to harm yourself right like. yeah um. And it's not just like. Because I wonder, I don't know sorry part of my part of me also wonders like if you binge on. rice, would you get the same feeling. As you've been john like."
11651.0,Patient,"No and. and actually you you bring this up and what you're saying I have this there's a mental image that I have that I experienced when i'm. bingeing on the process stuff. and there's a couple, but one of them related to the self harm. Is I see my. I kind of see my. The organs of my digestive system just my my body on the inside kind of like i'm. Like its own sentient being. and And i'm. shoving all because my body has to test to do work to process where I put in it. i'm depending on what I put in, it is going to is going to determine how hard my body has to work to try and keep me like in like a state of like homeostasis and balance function, and I see like. Like my mean separate from my body and and, as I put like this process things in and binge on it, I see my body like. crying and going like Why are you doing this to me right now, like can this be enough like why you keep putting the simian to like i'm tired like it's too much like please like we're going to keep doing this like Why are you doing this. And it's like not. Like I said it's it's separated for me. hmm and it feels like like my body's become helpless and it's just like, why do you keep doing this, why do you keep doing this she's doing this again like."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11651.0,Patient,We have to work even harder now to just like try to function. And then it's almost like I see myself as the monster like abusing this innocent that you know. Because my body like my body. Just responds to what I do my body can't take action to make those decisions. right and it can only respond. But it only has a certain capacity to how it responds to what I do to it and. yeah and um. yeah so i've had it's a mental image that I get a log on it specific with the process stuff.
528.0,Provider,Interesting does that happen like while you're bingeing or is it like before or after or like at what point do you have that image in your head.
11651.0,Patient,"it's um. Usually it'll it'll occur. About midway through a binge. And then, like the days that i've been usually it's kind of like. Not like a momentary event it's almost kind of like a day long thing I like i'll have. been binge. For a little bit, and then I stopped because i'm feeling sick. And then. On a binge eating again it's just kind of an all day thing and. When I when I have the first initial binge it's about it will start a have that image like about halfway through But then when I if I if I do eat again. it's it's like it's it's already there it's like she's doing this again we haven't even like healed from this get like, why does she even know like. We can't keep up with this anymore like, why are. You doing this and. It feels like just my body's crying."
528.0,Provider,"it's. really sad and painful to hear that I don't know I mean Have you ever told anybody about that. yeah well, I mean. It definitely seems like. You know, it is a form of self harm like you're it's like even though you know you're saying your body. is not your body's saying like your body is like screaming like stop you know stop doing this to me, but your mind is like or I don't know how you would I guess it's your mind that's kind of taken over, and just like wants to hurt you know, wants to is that how you would say it like."
11651.0,Patient,"it's not confidence like not consciously like trying to harm myself it's trying to numb myself. yeah is what it is, which. Because when I have one when they start to have that mental image as i'm doing it. And I keep going because you think like Oh, maybe okay stop but it's i'll keep doing it because it's like just shut up just shut up and don't tell me how much i'm hurting you just let me I don't want to feel anything so just shut up and stop talking to me about it. yeah um it's kind of more what it's like it's less about like intentional self harm and more just like i'm trying to shut everything off."
528.0,Provider,"gotcha Okay, have you ever like try like have you when you get. When you are you like bingeing or like starting a binge like Have you ever tried anything else, like besides using food to like numb out or to like him, besides alcohol and drugs, I mean like anything, besides like a substance let's say like to. kind of basically cope with your feelings are not cope like kind of dissociated."
11651.0,Patient,"No, because I it doesn't come to my mind when i'm in that state it's it seems almost like bingeing is the only option, and in those moments. How, however, I did. Yesterday it came into my mind, because, like because you've heard you've heard my complaints like i'm at this desk all the time, and you sit on that and I had this thought of like well how much time and energy are you exhausting on. bingeing you're like you're still sitting here, but now you're stuffing yourself and you're hurting yourself, and I have this mental fog and not only did you waste time like in the act of the bench but now you're going to waste consequential time trying to recover from this. For the next probably two days at least um why don't you like. instead. Take a 15 minute walk. And that, like that was the yesterday was the first day that I felt like well why don't you just take a walk when you start thinking about that."
528.0,Provider,No.
11651.0,Patient,So i'm going to try to remember that.
528.0,Provider,"I love that i'm like I can't believe that that just came to you yesterday and here, here we are having. This conversation. I mean, I definitely think that that's. Like a good direction to go in is like, and maybe and maybe next time we can talk more about other things because. Because it sounds like you really just need more tools to I mean part of it is that you need more tools, so that, like when you instead of just using food to numb out or you know, like deal with your feelings. Having other things to do, can be an option not that like I always say you can still keep food as an option like because as we've been kind of. As I keep bringing up this whole idea of anytime you take something away it's the exact thing that you're. going to want to do so, I would that's why I say we I would always keep the food as an option in your toolbox, but maybe exploring other. things to do, like walking is a great one, and you know, maybe like I said next time we can kind of come up with a list. Or you could just maybe start thinking about that this week Okay, what else would I do you know that would help me to you know calm me down or to help the help me to deal with my emotions that are. What do you think about that."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I I. I think you're right. The other thing too is like. I could call somebody. And it's it's just really hard to. I feel like when i'm saying this like i'm just making excuses, but i'm being honest like. Like I said what like in the in the past, I haven't done anything different because, like nothing different has come to my mind."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"by myself and. So i'm limited, you know my perspective, my perception and i'm and I think because i'm going through like this stuff with with my mom I kind of feel. like this is what i'm being overly dramatic, but like I kind of I kind of feel like I. I need a mother, like a surrogate mother figure in my life and i'm missing. A relationship like that, right now, and. And I know having a sponsor but I don't really feel connected with her, I have a heart, I don't know it just. i've never really felt fully connected to her, I just kind of asked her to be my sponsor because, like I didn't have a sponsor sponsor we move, so it wasn't like I don't feel connected with her, so I don't. feel like I have that that role in my life and i'm. And yeah and I, and I think I could also call someone. But I don't I don't call because number one it doesn't come to my mind, in those moments, and then number two like. I. don't my shit on it, you know. I don't want to call it just be like. Oh, I feel so bad this into my problems okay. Thanks bye. You know, it just."
528.0,Provider,You don't want to be a burden or something. yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"But the funny thing is like. If someone called me I wouldn't feel like they're being a burden, I am so glad you thought of me to call it. So I don't know why I can't see myself, you know, in that way."
528.0,Provider,"yeah now that's a good good. Good perspective to think about like you know why it's easy for you to like accept others, you know when they're they're struggling right, but for years, but you can't reach out it's harder for you to like put your stuff on other people kind of yeah. um well I think that's also a good option, you know again like look we look at if we think about like. You have a toolbox and and I was actually just I don't know I don't know why, but I was just like thinking, I wonder if the reason that you're. You suddenly have that thought was because, like you're ready to think about something else to you know, like. Like suddenly that popped i'm even doing this for how long and like suddenly yesterday, like that was the first time you thought about doing something else, like, I feel like. there's something to that like you might be like your your mind is actually telling you like i'm done with this like I need to like figure something else out I don't know that's just maybe that's just me being. really helpful."
11651.0,Patient,"I think you're right cuz I am i'm just I am i'm tired of it i'm tired. i'm tired of it and I don't. i'm only limited to what I know and what I don't know and there's a lot there's a lot more that I don't know them what I do know. And I, and I think you're right, I think I just need to have some more ideas that that also resonate. And since dark putting them into practice, too, because that's going to be enough like. I mean step one is like okay come up with the ideas and then step two is like okay Well now, you have to start using these ideas which is not what i'm used to doing."
528.0,Provider,"yeah. um well obviously we're about out of time today, but what I can I can send you I think I have a list of like 101 things to do, like to nurture yourself. and it's just a list for you to look at it just might like give you some ideas and you can think of your own ideas you know, but just to kind of get your brain thinking about that. And maybe for next week. don't don't try to do something I mean you can I don't want to like say you cannot you know, but like maybe just focusing on figuring out. Like what things you might want to try out like look at the list, think about some things on your own and just start like make it like a literal list like, not just in your head, but like like I would actually physically write it down. where you have like Okay, these are the things that I want to try i'm interested in trying. You know, in these kind of situations. Does that sound. Like doable to you or."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah yeah very much so, and also, I do. I do need to also tell myself I I struggle with, not counting calories. Okay, and and restricting and. i'm not like. Extremely restricting my calorie intake, but I have been keeping it around like 1100. About a day. Okay um, so I do like that, so that that's hard to not do. Okay, I am still eating, like everything that i've been logging, though I know i've been putting in a big bowl because it's just been more convenient to do that, right now, but, like everything that isn't as long as it is in the picture or. it's in the food, if you can't see all of it like I am eating the rice, and I am eating fats Miami. Protein um, but I do I do still struggling like how our accounting and and not going over like I start fruit like if it is are freaking out if it's like 1300 calories."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, well, thank you for you know letting me know about that and. I mean obviously we're not gonna be able to kind of dive into that part of it today, but i'm making a note for myself. If i've happened to forget, but just remind me next time but i'll i'm going to try to you know, make a note of it um. So that we can come back to that I think that's an important thing to come back to so does that sound good to you."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah. Well, keep I need to tell I need to tell myself. So yeah."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's Okay, I mean i'm here to help you so keeping it from me and struggling on your own is not going to be helpful for you right like. Oh, and I it's it's not a bad thing you know it's just it's not a helpful thing for you, that any right and so. Again there's a reason you're sharing because you know there's you know it's not helpful like you recognize it as like. you're struggling with that so yeah so what we'll come back to that sure yeah but for now just you know. I know we didn't talk too much about your actual eating but that's Okay, I saw that you were eating at least the three meals and I saw you were you know getting. You had the starches which I know that's what we talked about last time, which is important, so I would just say keep keep doing what you're doing with food at this point. let's focus on your toolbox this week just kind of like coming up with a list again if you want to try it out, you totally can but also if it takes the pressure off to not try it out and to just think about it, like, I think that that's fine too, you know. But I think that would be a good focus for this week and. yeah we'll come back to your eating and I really want to keep kind of exploring more about. You know how the sugar is serving you in terms of your binge like I feel. Like that's really important thing for us to keep like talking about. Like what's what's kind of what's there what's driving it what's you know you do think that would do you think, do you agree with me."
11651.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,Okay.
11651.0,Patient,yeah cuz it seems like the sugar. is blatantly like something i'm using to like to use as an escape.
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11651.0,Patient,it's definitely something that i'm like abusing.
528.0,Provider,"yeah and you don't see it as like. I mean definitely don't see it as a healthy thing at all. Like are no yeah. So that's why I want to keep kind of coming back to that. That idea and kind of help you to work through that a little bit more yeah. Okay well let's figure out a time for next week i'm whoops I mean does. Does this day work for you. In general, or next week."
11651.0,Patient,"And not not for next week. How, how are your Mondays."
