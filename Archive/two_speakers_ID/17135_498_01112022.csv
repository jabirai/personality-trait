But ya know it's horrible depressive say like I just. kind of lose it and, like i'm just like because I was a really know rather good mood that day, and then you just flipped and it looks real fast. to the point where I didn't even understand what happened, I tried going to a few friends it didn't help I went back to my know swing back to my main group, and what are the friends there just wasn't getting the hint thousand a bad mood and I snapped on him."

498.0,Provider,"um, how do you feel about giving effect, Sir, a try it's it's an antidepressant that's FDA approved for. depression, anxiety. But it also helps with anger impatience and restlessness. So it may be able to offer you some overall improvement benefit in several areas, and the reason I asked you about those other things, with regard to like cardiac issues and any issues with your eyes liver renal is because, if you're a patient who. suffer from medical issues in those areas use your refrain from its usage, you should also avoid aspirin if you're someone. That concerns aspirin on a daily basis it's not something that I will recommend, but since you don't present with any of those issues it may provide you with some overall benefit it's also known to like improve attention and focus on long with mood improvement. improvement with regard to anxiety and you could continue to use the hydroxyl been at night, in combination with it for me."
17135.0,Patient,I just use the hydrazine more as emergency thing for anxiety I don't really use it for at night at all. You know that you.
498.0,Provider,"Can yeah you can it's it's it's non habit forming is because it's a it's an Anti histamine. it's not a sedative it has sedative effect related to the anti histamine. Is what it's like benadryl. So you can use it in the evenings for sleep, as a matter of fact, I would implore you to do so into your sleep regulates off you give yourself allow yourself daily usage of it for a week and then you get give yourself some time to read them sleep without it."
17135.0,Patient,yeah I mean nicely thing it's kind of a it recurs all the time I have always had trouble sleeping since lat long thing once I can remember. I usually have them.
498.0,Provider,You know that you don't have to have trouble with sleep right.
17135.0,Patient,"yeah I know i've just it's just something i've always dealt with, I always go through this on and off thing we're like my insomnia, will just decide to hit it and now just be like. I can go days without what's a little bit like the little asleep, you know and sometimes I can go through pretty. You know, strong and beat my chest, and like nothing happened and i'll be fine some days i'll have my anxiety and depression pretty hard and it's like know the worst of Huambo combos to be hid you there's no sleep it being depressed being anxious. And then it'll hit hard."
498.0,Provider,"So do you do you feel like sometimes you have moments, where you require less sleep, or are you just able to go to sleep, but you want."
17135.0,Patient,"Just unable it's usually a head thing we're like my body will be tough physically tired, but mentally my mind, is just. Everywhere, and it won't it won't even be specifically in one place like if there were a big event that happened it's more just it's just doesn't want to sleep I can't no i'm not i'm not sleepy i'm tired, but i'm not sleeping."
498.0,Provider,"Well i'll probably keep a close eye on you over the next. Over the next couple of weeks until we kind of get your medication locked down to where we can determine if it's if it's efficient for you, but it's up to you if you would like to. Give the effects are trying to see if there's any benefit."
17135.0,Patient,Is there any other options.
498.0,Provider,yeah lots of options and you practice lexapro there's paxil there's more to.
17135.0,Patient,It tried lexapro but I had a more of a miniscule dosage I was told on the smaller dust is.
498.0,Provider,"This Jerry very, very small, if you are going to even restart it up, I will probably tell you to take that for a week and then double double up on that and then still plan to taper you up some. How do you feel like the lexapro introduction work for you, we."
17135.0,Patient,"don't know because it came at a time when I was like having some of the highest of high of anxieties anxiety and then depression was still kicking and harder and harder, but more of an anxiety at the time. And I don't know if it's maybe because I, at the same time, like gain more knowledge on on anxiety, how to control it. So it's kind of hard to really tell them that point."
498.0,Provider,How long were you on it.
17135.0,Patient,"that's a good question and, since it was definitely since 2013 since 2020. that's at some point late, maybe mid 2020 I don't remember."
498.0,Provider,"Well, maybe a year, you were on and you never took more than 10 milligrams."
17135.0,Patient,"No, I think it was just 10 milligrams. 20 milligrams possibly I think I might have to take two pills at some point."
498.0,Provider,"So what. Tell me i'll tell you what i'm thinking and then you, you tell me i'm kind of which direction you're comfortable with going if you feel like you received some benefit from lexapro that I can support resumption of that and. If not, then it may be beneficial for you to go into another direction you could still go with another antidepressant. And because a lot most antidepressants kind of support each other, one with regard to one way or another lexapro is kind of. an umbrella antidepressant it's it's really patient friendly it doesn't have a lot of interaction with a lot of other drugs it typically works. Really really well at around 20 milligrams So if you want to give that another try no issue it's easy to start an easy to stop, and so we would likely know over the next. Eight to 12 weeks, whether or not it's going to provide you with any benefit."
17135.0,Patient,"I mean we can try that if you if you think that'd be a better option it in all honesty I wouldn't. I can't quite remember how well the lexapro made me, but I know it did have some help, I think I can't deny that factor."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, if you feel like it provided you with some linkedin let's start there. And because, like I said it's it's a medication that's fairly easy to stop and fairly easy to start in fairly easy to stop. And so, with I wouldn't want you to start another therapy and wonder if lexapro should have been pursue i'm okay with starting there and giving it a chance to resume. assessing its efficacy and like I said eight to 12 weeks, we should know you know very early on whether or not is going to provide you any relief and if it does not, then we can move in a different direction, are you on current supply what's up bro."
17135.0,Patient,No actually. I had stopped it and I know I had a few refills left. My latest refill.
498.0,Provider,"And we want to contact the pharmacy and check and see if you have any refills in play, if not, I can submit it for you today."
17135.0,Patient,"We can do that, let me see something real quick. yeah I think that's the latest one that I have. As I mix them, which I shouldn't have. Do. It is. All right, how many records, I have loved. says, I want us to have. refills nine have nine records apparently left. Okay, I don't remember, if this is my most recent one, but possibly."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and you can call the pharmacy to see if you can have the medication refilled if you can't it's or any reason is expired and i'll I can submit one for you. But let's try to resume the lexapro take one tablet it's 10 milligrams correct. Yes, okay so take one tablet every day for one week and, after seven days on day number eight take two. To 10."
17135.0,Patient,And then from there you'll be describing me your. Your proper dosage what she thought was the right amount. We can do it.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so one week seven days 10 milligrams a day and then from eight days moving forward take 20 milligrams a day until I say otherwise okay. Okay, and then, are you do you attend groups weekly or every other week. weekly okay perfect so that way you can check in with me every week to let me know how the. medication okay. And for the next week and whenever you are having difficulty with sleep. I want you to take a hard drugs insane at night okay."
17135.0,Patient,Okay.
498.0,Provider,I know I know.
17135.0,Patient,"I don't like taking medication I not so much, could I can't I try to avoid medication, including advil for headaches and everything like that as much as I possibly can."
498.0,Provider,"i'm not saying that you have to take the hard rock scene it's just that I don't want you to go without adequate sleep, if you don't have to."
17135.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah definitely if i'm struggling really sharing with sleep i'll definitely take that or what i've been I think what I might have found out that possibly could work is taking his drinking. tea camera for the name of it camomile.
498.0,Provider,"chamomile tea yeah that's a good one, Tim i'll take that I just don't want you lying near not sleeping. yeah and if possible i'd like for you to journal for me. From now for the next month, how often you're having trouble falling asleep. So that I would like to get a really good, clear clinical picture on. How you're sleeping and and how your mood is on a daily basis okay."

But let me, let me initiate contact between you and Nicole because either either Nicole, or I coke and address that information more readily because they deal with it."
17135.0,Patient,"I mean i've avoided this for like the longest time I know I knew was an option. But we didn't. want to have that cushion underneath me, and then we get comfortable with having some kind of money income, with my home is it think getting worse, you know it was more of like we wanted to push myself don't don't focus on having that behind you."
