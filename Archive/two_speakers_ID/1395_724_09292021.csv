Oh sounds a little disappointed."
724.0,Provider,that's a bummer.
1395.0,Patient,yeah but you know there's anything I can do about it so except for just keep doing what i'm doing right now.
724.0,Provider,"Trying to be consistent and available, people will come around when they're ready, you know what I mean like they got to work through their own. processes, you know, especially if. Especially if the history is there, you know for the cause of their issues and we have to allow them to know that we're one available. But understand that if they're not ready to deal with it, yet then that's fine too. Definitely hurts a little bit, but. yeah is what it is we."
1395.0,Patient,"didn't I I think I more than being hurt, I think I understood you know so."
724.0,Provider,"it's mature yeah it's definitely mature sometimes the ones that we love, we end up hurting lot so. The most we can hope for is forgiveness, at some point, and then some growth moving forward."
1395.0,Patient,"I really leaned on her when I was like kind of first getting the consequences of all this drinking and stuff and. She was definitely there for me, but I think it was too much you know for so yeah."
724.0,Provider,How old is she.

724.0,Provider,that's a lot of pressure. So long as from a kid with a grown up. And the relationship is better.
1395.0,Patient,it's actually pretty decent yeah and it's nice to meet her boyfriend for the first time they're. All together for a couple of years and he's a really nice guy so.
724.0,Provider,What made the what made the impromptu surprise you guys anything special.
1395.0,Patient,Their roommate was coming down and they just decided to grab a ride with them. and Then they're going to be here till Saturday and then they're going to head back.
724.0,Provider,What was the last time you saw her.
1395.0,Patient,been. Probably like three or four months.
724.0,Provider,All right.
1395.0,Patient,We haven't had a lot of we haven't had a lot of communication recently.
724.0,Provider,And why is that.
1395.0,Patient,"um. You know I think she's just kind of doing her own life and. And that you know, I think that she had some sense that I had a relapse you know, a while back. and You know she's she's she's also tired of it, you know."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's understandable. So, since the last time we talked um Have you had any more slips or."
1395.0,Patient,No i've been I mean. I have to say that I thought about it on Sunday quite a bit. And I ended up just calling people and. yeah it hasn't been easy that's for sure. and thought about today because I was nervous about tonight. But you know i'm just i've kind of. just been trying not to go to go out a little bit. You know because I don't trust him trust myself. So i've been kind of.
724.0,Provider,"So sometimes that's what that's what you have to do sometimes you know what I mean like it seems like the like the most obvious thing and they'll turn to a certain degree, might feel like how come I can just not go out and behave myself but. Right easy solution just did not go out, you know what I mean like it's like the lesser of two evils it's like. All right, well, I should be strong and I should have enough like a willpower then at the end of the day, just be honest with yourself be like yeah I like if I don't have to go out and get myself and I won't have to deal with it later, so I might as well."
1395.0,Patient,Just right.
724.0,Provider,"Right now and then over time, you know what I mean, then you can start you know testing and lemons but if you're still on it like that headspace. Sometimes yeah equation just remove yourself from the problem it's like me, plus going out is a problem, do you like, I might as well just stay home and avoid. Well, as for me."
1395.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's what I did and actually I told my buddy that and the program and he said dude i'll take you to the store here give you the diggers store i'll take you to the store and he goes, and you know if you just need somebody there with you that's that's what it takes so."
724.0,Provider,"Well it's because I have that network sometimes it's need that Big Brother to like slap you in the head and be like all right let's go to the movies, you know what I mean like. yeah you know. And again, it seems like like such an obvious response to it, but sometimes the most obvious is the most easiest."
1395.0,Patient,yeah right.
724.0,Provider,Did you go to that i'll bill Maher recording.
1395.0,Patient,yeah we had a great time. wasn't. It was the game um no it's just bill Maher.
724.0,Provider,i'll just say.
1395.0,Patient,yeah for about you know 90 minutes he went for a while.
724.0,Provider,A while.
1395.0,Patient,"And the place was packed. It was a little bit awkward being with my parents, because he's kind of nasty. After my mom's I didn't realize you so nasty. yeah yeah he is."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know I don't I don't watch the show enough on HBO I always find like. to watch TV that often So when I do it's like the girlfriend and I will try to find something informative or. right on one of the spectrum it's got to be kind of informative but if I just need to check out from day to day life i'll watch something else, but I never find myself like watching this show because. Right, I think the model isn't fair I think he would, I think you'd be a lot better from it's like him and and one of his adversaries yes. But then we'll talk for a half hour and oppose that people are interrupting all the time I."
1395.0,Patient,said so yeah.
724.0,Provider,"It would like I like bill Maher because he's smart and he's he's well. yeah all those things, but I think they have it up a little bit for that show that he's got on HBO i'd much rather see him do like one on one have a conversation with somebody."
1395.0,Patient,"His his his. On stage shows nothing like his HBO show it's like you know a lot of a lot of sex references and a lot. Of Okay, you know kind of really. graphic."
724.0,Provider,That is awkward.
1395.0,Patient,"Like sitting next to my dad and my mom so I thought, a little bit better."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean that's awkward.
1395.0,Patient,But we had a good time and you know they. They enjoyed it so.
724.0,Provider,um. So how often how many meetings you go into now.
1395.0,Patient,I go to one a day on zoom okay yeah I go primarily my one is it three o'clock at a San Francisco that I attend.
724.0,Provider,"um they don't have any they don't have any local was that you can attend in person, where you're at."
1395.0,Patient,"For some reason I haven't been able to work myself up to that yeah and you know, there are a couple of there's there's one actually. up in San Rafael at noon time every time every day and it's outside and stuff like that, so I can go to that I just haven't gotten myself there yet."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, but you're thinking about it right."
1395.0,Patient,hey i'm totally yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Well, again."
1395.0,Patient,I know I know it's the answer.
724.0,Provider,"you're going to have like a lot of firsts here like you know what I mean like pretty soon, just as you are right now, you know what I mean, so the fact that you're thinking about is a step in the right direction. So you don't have to feel you have to put enough pressure on yourself to you know, the goal, because you are going to you know you're doing the virtual thing the next progression obviously would be in person, but it's not like you're not doing anything so."
1395.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"Now, a little bit is it's enough, you know, in the beginning, so you know, keep that motivation and keep doing that and eventually you'll find yourself sitting outside enjoying the sun. yeah getting with people in person. Is kind of like what we're we're all meant to be doing it's it's it's weird but Tele health, you know."
1395.0,Patient,It is.
724.0,Provider,"And i'm sure the meetings are very similar, but on the flip side like anything else there's always a positive, it allows people to be more open than it probably would be. You know if they were in person, I find like a lot of people pretty guarded in person."
1395.0,Patient,For his yeah.
724.0,Provider,"His videos allow people to kind of come out of their Shell, a little bit more and a little bit quicker so."
1395.0,Patient,"i've gone to a couple Thursday nights that are near near where I live, and. To and. My sponsor just says, I just want you to say something when you're in there, you know just raise your hand, so I did actually share a couple of times. in person, and you know it does feel good to do that yeah."
724.0,Provider,They have you on the medication here.
1395.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,how's that working out for you.
1395.0,Patient,"I don't know I really can't tell. I listened to Dr greenberg about doubling up on the gabba penn. And it made me like really just like like I was going through withdrawals. Really really shaky. So I talked to my psychiatrist who I have actually have a call with tomorrow, and she said why don't you just keep the first two doses so morning and afternoon the same in and double up at night. So that's what i've been doing so i'm a little bit more calm, but I definitely feel the effects of that."
724.0,Provider,And are you still taking the transit on.
1395.0,Patient,i'm i'm out of that right now i've just been taking over the counter sleeping pills.
724.0,Provider,"Okay um i'm always like like a I don't know if we talked about last time, like i'm i'm somewhat of a staunch anti supporter of like over the counter sleeping pills I don't like that, for people."
1395.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"I think melatonin is a much safer alternative. melatonin Okay, it makes some people fall asleep, but really what it's designed to do is. improve quality of sleep it's not going to make you pass out but it definitely when you do fall asleep it definitely does help. And I don't do you experienced any kind of like like groggy side effects when you wake up the morning coming off a sleeping pills."
1395.0,Patient,From the transit don't I do actually. Try and then like like. i'm kind of stiff and stuff like that so.
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean all those nighttime stuff you know they're always going to have some kind of side effect because what it's. What it's asking you for us really to like in a better word like sedate you.
1395.0,Patient,You know and put you right.
724.0,Provider,keep you asleep so you're always going to pay for that first thing the morning as far as like cognition goes up a little foggy a little slow.
1395.0,Patient,Go yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's the same thing, like when you take like a cough medicine and you know, like nighttime cough medicine next morning you wake up well at least I do I wake up and i'm, just like in a haze. Right, so I mean it does what it's supposed to do right but there's always going to be a you know, a con Tu Tu it's pro."
1395.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, some might prescription for the tragedy and said, one or two. At night, and when I was kind of going through the after the relapse thing I was taking too, so I went through the prescription pretty quickly. yeah and they wouldn't fill that because it wasn't within the time frame."
724.0,Provider,You know.
1395.0,Patient,So i'm just waiting for that.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, when is your next refill date for that."
1395.0,Patient,I think it's just early October.
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I mean uh. You know what I mean like if you can I, you know I always encouraged melatonin over. Anything else like sleep aid they even at like think is equal has melatonin in it. That type of stuff."
1395.0,Patient,yeah i've been doing the advil PM thing.
724.0,Provider,"And what happens is like eventually like it's like anything else, like the body will be like become dependent on it just to fall asleep at night that's like the last thing you want to have."
1395.0,Patient,sleeping is supposed to be.
724.0,Provider,Actual thing for us and. Relying on something that puts you to sleep is always that's always a little dicey right.
1395.0,Patient,"Well, you know, since. You want the same guy that was telling me about you taking me shopping tells me, you know if your days going good how's your day going not so good. And you start to fuel, you know kind of days, he. just go to bed, so I take it, and I go to bed like 930 or something so i've been waking up like you know, four and five o'clock in the morning. And then I just kind of I should get up and do something, but. I kind of lay there and toss and turn and think about shitty stuff and. I have."
724.0,Provider,"yeah and there's not a whole lot to distract yourself that early in the morning. yeah and there's really not I mean you could turn on the TV but. i'm gonna find anything entertaining that early in the morning. No, no um do you do any like exercise, like any self."
1395.0,Patient,"I do okay. I do, I walk a lot and I am just starting to get back to the gym. I went yesterday and. Another friend of mine is actually sponsoring me at the gym so he kind of calls and says, have you been you know, and you should go and he'll pick me up with once a while, on the weekends and we'll go so. Controlling do that."
724.0,Provider,just go on there and kind of like like warm it up stretch out your search out the joints kind of get back into the little slow.
1395.0,Patient,I do the bike. me do the peloton and then add waves.
724.0,Provider,"All right, good. I mean that should help give you better quality sleep. Like tire you out to the point to where you're like oh I gotta go home now pass out, but like, as the body to recover a breakdown from like muscle fatigue and all that kind of stuff you do get good sleep, because the body's like at a recovery phase. So that's definitely a park to exercise. And I never really go for more than an hour."
1395.0,Patient,45 minutes type of thing yeah.
724.0,Provider,Sometimes you need like you don't need to like over.
1395.0,Patient,there.
724.0,Provider,"Because, if you do the next time you go to the gym you'll do less, because your body's still trying to heal. So you're even less productive and you're more prone to injury and all that kind of stuff is almost like like a sweet science and they say about 30 to 45 minutes is kind of like the goldilocks zone for. For exercise, like you, you know, unless you're training to be like a pro athlete you probably don't need any more than that, and you know. You know, three, four or five times a week is pretty sufficient. You know that'll progress life and you'll feel good you'll notice obviously physical changes your mental health. yeah prove like exercises key. exercise and set key for mental health for a lot of times. It helps replenish dopamine serotonin and all those things it's a very holistic approach to improving one's mental health overall. So yeah."
1395.0,Patient,"yeah I remember when I went to 30 when I went to the 30 day program early on. It was like an integral part of our day you know, is going to the gym and or swimming or you know, whatever."
724.0,Provider,yep.
1395.0,Patient,some kind of physical activity. mm hmm.
724.0,Provider,"yep yeah it's um. yeah if you add that to your daily curriculum for your daily weekly curriculum like you'll be able to fill up your time with positives and then you're less likely have like any kind of room for a negative thoughts and behavior. Right so that's good. Any. I know the job prospect, we touched on it all the time, but because you're like your licensure and all that kind of stuff Have you considered. Any other options for employment, or you can tell what you're doing."
1395.0,Patient,"Well, I haven't done any anything for a couple of weeks about that I look, and you know I think i've mentioned, I applied to a couple places. And thought I was hired at one of them, and then the guy called back like. Two weeks later, and said, well, we can't really easy right now. So if you have another opportunity, you should take it, so I took that as, even though they they wanted me suppose we've made it never happened, so I haven't really done anything since then."
724.0,Provider,Were you discouraged by that and kind of slowed it down or.
1395.0,Patient,"Well, you know what it just made me think like. You know well, I was the real reason. You know, and I, of course I kind of got got my head and thought like well, maybe you know he knew somebody that I knew or something like that and got the got the real story. But a lot of people just told me that you know you just have to take everything at face value and. and You know move on to something else."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean because they probably could have gave you like a real generic response, but the fact that they were like couldn't can use you right now. So, and then he said to seek out other opportunities if one presents itself means that he didn't want you to like he didn't want to waste your time."
1395.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"i've been let down a lot harder than that in the past, so um that's actually not it's not a terrible way to like to let somebody off the hook, you know so."
1395.0,Patient,"what's the backstory was that. If there are a lot of college kids who work for him. And I guess, a lot of people didn't go back to school, so they they're staying home and they kept their job. me and he didn't he didn't know they were not going to go back to school, so it kind of makes sense."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean things are really unpredictable right now, you know I mean. i've been sick for. Eight days now."
1395.0,Patient,With what.
724.0,Provider,"I have no idea. i'm calling it a common cold, because I don't want to call it anything else. But."
1395.0,Patient,Have you been checked.
724.0,Provider,No so.
1395.0,Patient,Just this full denial.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean like if I felt like I was sick enough that warranted like it like a trip to the hospital like I would have done that um but it never got to that point, no i've been sick before I had swiped flew back in like 2008 so like like that was that was awful."
1395.0,Patient,And I probably should have.
724.0,Provider,"A hospital for that, and it would have been warranted, but this was nowhere near that. I chalked it up my daughter she's four and she just went back to school in the middle. Right September within the first week she came back she had a runny nose, she was sick. yeah like my girlfriend got sick I got sick I had, like all your your standard symptoms of. You know, correct plush flu. Granted it's kind of early in the year that kind of stuff where i'm from but. You know I just felt like right now I feel like my head feels like it's all underwater."
1395.0,Patient,yeah you sound like.
724.0,Provider,"ingestion I got post nasal drip my ear pressures been off for a couple of days. But, like last Tuesday I had a call it a work just because, like sore throat, you know headache like there's no way I was gonna communicate with anybody, I was so foggy. But nothing, nothing crazy and I can't use the smell or taste test symptom for the coven because I haven't been able to smell or taste anything and like 15. Already that's that's a symptom that I deal with every day. But yeah I mean I didn't feel great, but I didn't feel like my end of the world, either, so I was just like I took a lot of vitamin C and drink OJ and. Right X some hot showers and just took it easy. So. minute I guess."
1395.0,Patient,Like I mean yeah sounds like me i'm. doing a detox.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it was similar to that, I mean like when they when they say, people are detoxing from alcohol or opiates it's like full like symptoms certain so you're like what you're."
1395.0,Patient,Saying yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I feel like crap and it's like like flu like no like yeah it's like okay yeah yeah like upset stomach headaches cold when it's you know just like that's those those symptoms are like synonymous, for when your body's fighting off like a viral infection or a. Just really like an infection and that's what it felt like you know. Like I was sick, like all the other times i've been sick. So I just chalk it up to kids being a petri dish for."
1395.0,Patient,Right exactly.
724.0,Provider,Terry and stuff so.
1395.0,Patient,My my first wife actually teach the second grade and she's like. Sick all the time.
724.0,Provider,"yeah they really are like I had one one time I got real sick my my nephew and I normally never get sick like my immune system has been pretty good except after I got swine flu, like my immune system was compromised for a long time, so I would get sick pretty easy but. Up until that point like I was. really good, but my nephew was sick, he was going to school and my dad was like oh don't touch the boy he's whatever and I was like playing with them and. next morning I was like I was taking a shower and I was going on my way to work and the shower like I coughed and I was like that's weird and then I P, and I was like what I was like that's strange and then after that it was just full blown out. For both ends, I was super sick and they're really yeah it's like neuro virus or. they're like we're gonna go back to school you just you get wrecked and I was like."
1395.0,Patient,Well yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I experienced that so now, when the kids got the sniffles i'm like okay vitamin C zinc."
1395.0,Patient,put on some rubber gloves.
724.0,Provider,"Yes, machination there it is and hydrated drink a lot of water, you know it's key gatorade pedialyte all that stuff. So cool. So working going to put on the back burner for a little bit."
1395.0,Patient,"yeah I just think you know I just think that um I don't I don't have enough sobriety to really be employable at this point. Right and. and and also my sponsor he's kind of anti me just getting any job he wants me to find a place that. will allow me to get my licenses back and kind of get back into the students seat, I was in so he's kind of encouraged me just a get six months get three months, get you know get some months and then and then really kind of have a clear head. about it. So. Most of the other people around me don't agree with that, but. anyway."
724.0,Provider,"I mean, it can be both you know what I mean like he can be right in the people around you could be right to really what it boils down to is like do you have the ability to go three months without having a dream. If you're honest with that that means that maybe you can wait three months and land the position. That put you back to where you were, but if you don't have three months and you're unreliable."
1395.0,Patient,Then it will be.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, to maybe find an unreliable job because."
1395.0,Patient,it's not gonna. burn any. Bridges right.
724.0,Provider,um so let's.
1395.0,Patient,"Just let the cat no. Come on, take don't take."
724.0,Provider,Like a movie.
1395.0,Patient,"She was. When before I. hooked up with my second. Second partner. She was a cat that that we got I was recently separated from my first wife and so she's 17 so long ago was. and I had taken my girls to a wedding and they just hated it, they were young is like foreign foreign aid and we're coming back to Center fell and there's a pet arcade on the highway and they're all let's stop looking at the chat and we end up buying this like $3,000 CAP. And there's just a ton of guilt guilt thing right. And then you know i've been kind of you know, moving around in and out of rehab and stuff like that, so my parents took them took her. And the cat 1717."
724.0,Provider,"wow that's not some holes cat man. Well, so yeah I mean, I mean the job thing it's both options are reasonable. Really it depends on you, it depends on your ability to you know stay the course and then it depends on whether or not you have the financial. You know luxury of taking your time before you get back into the game to where you can really focus on, you know focus on your sobriety focus on developing support networks and coping strategies and all that all that. Some people don't have that financial you know cushion to where they're like okay I. know my rent is paid for you know i'm living i'm not living extravagantly, but I have some money i'm not going to go i'm not going to starve to death. So, as long as you have some of those basic necessities in place and there's no risk of losing them then maybe yeah maybe you Maybe you can take your time to really focus on you. Know get get your demons sorted out and then get back into the game."
1395.0,Patient,But I think I told you that I got a. Part of this program it's through the county it's called a whole person care.
724.0,Provider,You gave us like housing assistance and you got all that stuff.
1395.0,Patient,yeah it's.
724.0,Provider,Not living like super extravagant but like you're down. That right so.
1395.0,Patient,yeah exactly. yeah and.
724.0,Provider,That helps.
1395.0,Patient,"yeah so. they've always been there for me and that's great and. You have a therapist through that program well, so I talked to him on Mondays and. Yesterday, what came up was he said you're still exhibiting such an. awful amount of shame. And he said I want you to really do some work on reading about it, what it's about me he doesn't you know it's not it's not you it's just something that is happening to you. And he said I don't think you're going to get better until you figure that out."
724.0,Provider,"yeah and he's he's 100% right shame is like the underlying feeling that runs. Through the core of everybody. That struggles with chemical dependency because eventually what it costs was everything. Right and you'll realize that when you're in it, you know because you're so deep in the in the fog bank that you can't see the impact of like your actions and your. Your choices and how it affects everybody else, but as you come out of that fog bank you get to start seeing, like all the damage."
1395.0,Patient,that's been.
724.0,Provider,"directed wake right, and then it, you know I mean it's it's haunting right. And then over there, just like visually just like you could use like like the ship wreck metaphor you're literally on the beach just picking up pieces and those pieces of that records like your family. it's your history it's your occupation it's all those things and you're just like oh how am I ever going to fix this and you feel whole. grid. or helpless, you know what I mean and a lot of times like like all those feelings like rush in just like anything else and it's hard to cope with that because, for the longest time you weren't. I say you and I mean we, like all of us we're all like that so. Shame is one of the underlying If not, probably the most critical of feelings that you're going to have to address now there's a there's a book, do you have time they're like read a book."
1395.0,Patient,yeah totally.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so i've been on this kick because my my mentor in substance abuse, who who got me like my first job. I really look up to this guy and he taught me a lot of cool shit and he and I have, for I developed like a very similar approach and it's probably why he and I connected, we have like a. Like a solution based approach like I don't want to spend too much time like like psycho analyzing stuff because if the outcomes it's going to be like yeah I realized that my dad was addicted me all this time and it's like."
1395.0,Patient,But you already knew that so it's like.
724.0,Provider,"Is it now that you say it out loud does that help you where we're at it's like probably not so i'd like to like move forward, and you know get to to where we can start being productive again. So when I talked to him, he was like he was like Have you ever heard of like a logo therapy. And I was like no he's like all right, this is book, I want you to read and he's super animated you know he's a great guy as by a guy named Viktor frankl and i'm like that sounds familiar and he's like yeah it's called man's search for meaning, I believe. Something to that effect if you just look up Viktor frankl."
1395.0,Patient,yo fire.
724.0,Provider,Man finds meaning.
1395.0,Patient,And it's the same meaning.
724.0,Provider,"Meaning yep and the theory behind this guy's approach the psychology and therapy is that the human condition, particularly as males is that we are looking for purpose and without purpose we're like we're truly just wandering around."
1395.0,Patient,And we don't get.
724.0,Provider,"Your self fulfillment and I I guys he's explaining it to me and i'll probably paraphrasing and I was, like all right that sounds cool but that seems pretty obvious to you right he's like he's like. he's like he's like, but the craziest thing is, is that this guy he's a doctor he's created this therapeutic model that people are that buy into and it's very like holistic and you know moving forward, I kind of shifted he's like dude was a Holocaust survivor."
1395.0,Patient,Like yeah.
724.0,Provider,And I was like oh.
1395.0,Patient,there's so if anybody has learned anything about finding.
724.0,Provider,"Like the purpose of the meaning of life, he was like this guy had it and he's gonna if that guy could get it that you can get it. And then anybody that's ever felt like that that that longing for something they can get it to. Music so get the book, so I bought the book and I haven't started reading it, but i've researched like some mojo therapy seven I guys, I was reading it, I was like I was like yeah I kind of dig it, I was like yeah so i've been telling people to if you have time get that book."
1395.0,Patient,it's not that good.
724.0,Provider,"it's kind of like a small book, you know what I mean. yeah man search for me so, then I was, like all right, you got any other like gems things that I should read so then he sent me there's there's other ones called a drift and it's by Stephen callahan and this guy was stranded at sea for like. an obsession upon a time, so like I started seeing a pattern like in these recommendations that he gave me and I was like are you okay dude. Are you all right, and he was like yeah why I was like I see all these recommendations you're sending me all about man's like. meaning and purpose in life I was like I know you get all. And I was uh he tried to tell me something he's like you know that, until you said something that I start like like connecting those dots he's like he's like I don't know, maybe, maybe, and I was like. All right, i'll read it, because I feel like men get to like this extra central point in their life to where. You know, once we get all my back you know the back nine or whatever it is really start reflecting off like our legacy and, like the meeting. yeah so."
1395.0,Patient,"Well, I think that's where I am you know. And right now it's it's it's not a pretty legacy, you know it's not you know all the even even the you know 30 years of success that I had prior to kind of falling apart is definitely overshadow you know. and People will remember today and yesterday and that's that's it."
724.0,Provider,"Like right now you're like you're like that Barry bonds and mark mcgwire like. This well there's like. yeah you did like a lot of good stuff you know what I mean and people benefited from it, and all that stuff but there's an Asterix next year name. yeah onto the bottom and you read that, as you can see, like."
1395.0,Patient,Did there.
724.0,Provider,"Yet, however, did some shit."
1395.0,Patient,And it's yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I too proud and it's like should that Asterix outweigh like everything that you've done probably not we shouldn't be measured by like like like the failures like that we do that on our own, I always say like like you."
1395.0,Patient,know.
724.0,Provider,"Your failures than you do like your success right. yeah we already do that on our own, the problem is is having other people measure us the same way, so. I think you know and a lot like what that 32 it's like purposes everything So if you can find purpose and one thing that really motivates you gets you going and that's it, that means that there's hope for you still and there's direction and motivation and all those good things. they're just waiting to take that initial step and commit to."
1395.0,Patient,"You know, and in prior when I was. I was actually. In a homeless, shelter and. I was volunteering at the Salvation Army once a week and. Essentially, passing out food, so we had like 150 people come through a food line. And I was just there every Tuesday and I did that, and you know it's like pure four hours or whatever. But the purpose and the you know just the gratitude that I felt from the people that I helped was you know got me through months of sobriety you know, and even though I definitely have a chronic relapse problem. That that was actually purpose and that that helped and work."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah i'm a firm believer in it, and even if I couldn't put a title on it like when he told me like it resonated I was like that makes sense and I can't be like the only person, because I always tell. You know, patient, especially like male patients because that's what I dealt with the most and treatment was like. Like I was having a hard time dealing with female patients because i'm like What do you do for like you would you do for fun, what are your hobbies like I don't know whatever my boyfriend likes her and i'm like. No, I mean like what are you."
1395.0,Patient,Are you.
724.0,Provider,"And they really they don't have anything and it's like like I can't relate, because I don't know that tell what they should maybe look into that might pique their interest, without coming off like being sexist or like. Right. There by loud, but their biological imperative in existence is to have children, I get that. right out of that, and it is a it can be a job and it's rewarding that's all those things I was like but before that, like there's nothing but for guys we we had sports we had competition we have. great art, we have all these things and it's like. yeah it's easy for me to be like yeah man you just got to find that thing that usually like to do in like invest your time and energy into it, you know because that's we were task orientated we're creatures of habit, we like to check boxes off we'd like success that's measurable. Right yeah mechanics for the most part, love their jobs because they get this started project and finish it by the end of the day and it's like."
1395.0,Patient,I did.
724.0,Provider,"or tattoo artists it's like I did that. I think we're inherently always looking for that that meaning and purpose and whatever that is once you find that you gotta like latch on to it, because then the energy that you can put into it's like. Like On unsolicited on tap tons of resource like you can just commit to it so just going to get back to that thing man, I think we all got it so if you got some free time, maybe read the book and might inspire you it's got nothing. to grab addiction, which is typically like like what I could do with patients it's like I like them to read stuff that isn't about addiction. isn't about addiction, because."
1395.0,Patient,All right.
724.0,Provider,Let me change your people places and things if you gotta keep getting reminded about your people places and things it's like.
1395.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Open out something that you probably would never talked about it used to show patients documentaries that were in foreign languages and they'd be like what the wire. But by the end you know what I would just sit back and watch him and I was like you know why I showed this to you guys and like was like because you probably would never do it on your own. And you some exposure to like culture and mindfulness and all these things, and it might pique something in you that you didn't know that you had so I like to talk to people like they're just normal people you know we all. Have humans, you know. Some of them in the closet so number on front street but either way where we can get him to work system."
1395.0,Patient,"You know the other thing that came up for me and another. Probably close to being over but. This time of year it's my it's my ex's birthday tomorrow and in the past we actually haven't been together for like five years, but I still have been sending their gifts and cards and trying to communicate with their and. And sometimes she responds back sometimes she didn't so I realized that you know i'm just finally wasting my time like this is, this is a like an anchor around my neck still. Right and. I just. yeah and I just actually just told a bunch of people that this was happening to me. And they're all okay we're gonna call you that day, and you know don't send flowers don't send anything and if she did she do we're going to like you know kill you type of thing. And so I haven't done anything, and I feel pretty good about it so. You know."
724.0,Provider,Over the closure.
1395.0,Patient,So anyway.
724.0,Provider,"Now I like it, I like it man. yeah the fact that you could admit that it that it's this burden that you've been carrying around this hopeless or hopeful burden that you've been carrying around."
1395.0,Patient,This hopeless.
724.0,Provider,that's essentially turning into something that's hopeless.
1395.0,Patient,Now it's already hopeless.
724.0,Provider,yeah.
1395.0,Patient,"I just I just haven't been able to let it go, and this is kind of like first step to doing that so."
724.0,Provider,"that's huge yeah that's good progress. yeah I can dig it I like it. All right. Anything else pressing, how are you on your surveys your current with those you're saying."
1395.0,Patient,"No i'm not actually I got it. I got a text today and I tried to hit the link, but I just didn't couldn't do on my phone so i'm going to do it on my laptop later, you tomorrow."
724.0,Provider,"yep make sure you do. The new I mean this is greg's last session this coming Thursday, so that the following Thursday will be the new the new doctor. And I I haven't met the doctor I don't know where they stand as far as like. Surveys surveys and that kind of stuff so I tell people like it's like the path of least resistance. You know, for you guys just get the service dog."
1395.0,Patient,yeah i've got like three of them to do so.
724.0,Provider,yep just get them done.
1395.0,Patient,"That way, you don't have to wear."
724.0,Provider,"Something like hey you're out of compliance like no i'm not I do every Sunday like I don't worry about you know I mean. um but yeah, although that. yeah it's progress."
1395.0,Patient,"And so, like, if I were trying to get to to the surveys after we're done here, how do I do that, how do I."
724.0,Provider,It should send you like an email link right.
1395.0,Patient,or I got that. But I got it on my phone and I tried to do it on my phone I just couldn't get it to work.
724.0,Provider,"If they say, like the like the like the the phone version of the surveys are not very useful because you got to like like open them up and. Put your address, like i've heard like a lot of people complain about it tomorrow complains about it all the time, so just easier to do it on your on your laptop or your. tablet okay with. us at home just get on there, go to that link and just plug away some of them are you know, six, seven questions the other ones like nine. Right like they're not that Labor and."
1395.0,Patient,they're not now i've done one. i've done one and they're not a big deal.
724.0,Provider,"yeah they're really pretty easily managed so just going to get up get them out of the way, so you don't have to worry about them."
