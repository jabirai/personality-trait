408.0,Provider,"Oh, I see did you get a chance to go to the library and look around the library at all since our last session."
14589.0,Patient,know how mixer library. library i've been reading good books at home.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we did talk about that good for you. good for you and have you been able to start to enjoy that again or you're just going through the motions."
14589.0,Patient,know I enjoy cooking yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Do you enjoy looking at the cookbooks. yeah good good good, because that was one of the issues, remember, we talked about is you had kind of a loss of interest in some of your usual activities, and so we were thinking about doing things that could. kind of get you activated and get you energized more mentally and emotionally, because I know you're doing a lot of physical work with your landscaping business. Man so they're looking at the cookbooks was more your kind of mental focus and positive emotional energy around some of the things you like doing like cooking."
14589.0,Patient,Yes.
408.0,Provider,Good good so.
14589.0,Patient,Chris through. What it release my stress to you.
408.0,Provider,"Absolutely, yes. You can do it's kind of like Have you ever heard of mindfulness before."
14589.0,Patient,No.
408.0,Provider,"So mindfulness is a relaxation. skill or approach that you can use with just regular things you're doing so, for example, cooking is a kind of activity that tends to people tend to get into a more relaxed calm focused state of mind. And that's mindfulness when you can just focus on what you're doing right maybe you're chopping up some vegetables. You focus on that and the movements of your hands and the sound of the of the vegetable the Chris vegetables being chopped the smells of the cooking and you let everything else go for a few minutes and it it helps you to just be in the moment in a positive way. that's mindfulness."
14589.0,Patient,"All right, I do be a piece will tell me."
408.0,Provider,"There you go that's what that's mindfulness and you can do that really with virtually any movement any kind of physical activity or movement that you're doing. it's just a matter of getting that focus and getting in that mindset where you're having that Zen moment have you heard that term before. Yes, yeah where you're just focused in in the moment and they what you're hearing seeing smelling touching and you're not judging it, there are no critical voices in your head there's no. urgency to do something you're just in the moment and appreciating using all of your senses and just going at that natural rhythm that natural rhythm. And you can do that obviously cooking is a real good activity that tends to induce mindfulness. You can do it when you're just walking you can do it when you're washing dishes. Other activities that tend to induce that Zen state of mind are drumming. Right. With your hands like percussive instruments. yeah that you know i'm saying that. Pressure that beach on drumming tends to induce that kind of altered mindfulness state. You singing can do it, we do singing and group, you may have noticed."
14589.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"yeah so hold. This yeah yeah yeah so doing those notes either long sustained note or a percussive note to get more energy right or you can do mindful breathing to slow down and calm your arousal if you're too agitated or something like that or to irritable. Those that's all about mindfulness which is being in the moment. Not not with judgment, you know, not with any kind of pressure. But just enjoying being in the moment. So good so that's what I was hoping, you would get from looking at the cookbooks."
14589.0,Patient,yeah got it. I got it good.
408.0,Provider,Good deal. That is when I got that's like relaxation for the brain.
14589.0,Patient,"yeah. I got a lot of relaxation now man I just be stressed out Oh, you know what don't. mean like this is coming. This is coming up on our like second month of third month being sober Oh, you know. yeah it's a good feeling, all together, you know. You know I just get I get a basic half of just being sober now, you know that."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
14589.0,Patient,"You just feel so good man, you know."
408.0,Provider,feel real great.
14589.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,On your mind.
14589.0,Patient,"How was just thinking like you know. it's been a while man, since I just like I say I do feel a whole lot better than just being sober man, you know I don't have anything on my mind bad, but, like last for X, at least. To us was really bad, you know that. Because it was just like every day, you had to have. You know. Now for the whole lot better to you know."
408.0,Provider,Well that's great hold on to that feeling that natural high.
14589.0,Patient,"gear, but sometimes you still get to urge people places and things man I think imma change a few of my friends out there, I just be hanging out and they really use like you know me but not around me they still use, you know I mean. yeah that's important that's important."
408.0,Provider,And it's good you're noticing that. And what about the places and things.
14589.0,Patient,"I think, by myself most the time you know I like solid to. know."
408.0,Provider,"yeah but, even when you're by yourself. places and things can still trigger cravings if they're associated with drug cues."
14589.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
408.0,Provider,Any of those going on.
14589.0,Patient,"No, no i'm doing pretty good we have it, would you know."
408.0,Provider,"Well, I know your your wife has been going through a hard time lately has that had an impact on you."
14589.0,Patient,"know. You know, actually changed she doing you know. I just help her out as much as I can. But i'm not able to change have feelings, you know not. You know, but she's like oh no man she's doing pretty good but not really, really bad you know I mean she can be doing a lot better that you know. Our dad going through a divorce shit like it, so you know we can't really do nothing about it but she's she's dressing, just as much as him, you know."
408.0,Provider,yeah but this list you just you're reminding her that you can't do anything about that is helpful.
14589.0,Patient,yeah yeah I can't she gave me.
408.0,Provider,As i'm saying. just remind her that and worrying doesn't accomplish anything.
14589.0,Patient,"No, it don't."
408.0,Provider,except to bring you down bring yourself down.
14589.0,Patient,yo yo do.
408.0,Provider,"You know, unless you can be. Part of the solution, but if you can't be part of a solution, then it's just. Bringing you down. So how's your sleep, are you sleeping these days."
14589.0,Patient,"sleep pretty good. You know, we got a hot tub for us not to fucking go sleep."
408.0,Provider,Nice.
14589.0,Patient,"It put me write down, you know."
408.0,Provider,Nice yo yeah they're very relaxing.
14589.0,Patient,"yeah it like you know I got like a mentally I got I broke my femur Emma Emma League and like fireplace. Oh, and then I got screws and plate to my home and I got like a peek bone Mr."
408.0,Provider,yeah yeah oh wow.
14589.0,Patient,"And then they fixed it, you know I mean I got it and I used to have plates in it, but I used to have pain me, you know. that's what people don't understand. You know, and then I guess I you know get on drugs."
408.0,Provider,"So, what are you doing to manage the pain now. The hot tub."
14589.0,Patient,"You know, at least not that bad it's just in the morning and when it rains. Okay, and i've been trying my best just to deal with it, you know."
408.0,Provider,Just kind of ignore it or distract yourself.
14589.0,Patient,yeah yeah I do some work and try to ignore try my best to ignore you know.
408.0,Provider,"uh huh. Well that's good, because if you focus on it a lot and get get upset about it that actually increases your perception of the pain. If you get upset about it yeah whereas I mean if you just focus on it and say yeah that's that's there and then you breathe in slowly breathe out slowly and just let it go and do something else that tends to help the pain perception."
14589.0,Patient,"You do. a really good. yeah it's like so hot outside too, and when it's hot I feel better, though, you know I mean like it don't know when it's hot."
408.0,Provider,You know okay okay good so that helps your pain.
14589.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
408.0,Provider,So I guess when it gets to be more like winter weather will have to talk more about some of the pain management strategies.
14589.0,Patient,"yeah, of course, like you know i'm just drinking it myself, you know. Our long Johns all the time, because my legs and still get real cold, no."
408.0,Provider,"Well, and you won't be working as much right outdoors."
14589.0,Patient,"Now, being a half of the time you know."
408.0,Provider,"yeah so here's here's the deal that's that's why i'm recommending you go ahead and get a library card now. and get acquainted with resources like your local library, so that when that time comes, and you have some more downtime you have options. for getting out of the House to another place that's warm with some positive activities available ways to distract yourself from the pain ways to engage in mindfulness like looking at new cookbooks things like that. Prepare ahead of time."
14589.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"well. If you will you think you can get to that that library sometime in the next couple of weeks and get a library card. yeah. cuz it's gonna start to chill down here, you know and in about a month or so."
14589.0,Patient,we're West Virginia it's going to be 60 degrees out next week.
408.0,Provider,haha there you go see what i'm saying. You plan ahead and plan ahead.
14589.0,Patient,"Dan in the House when they get cold, you know."
408.0,Provider,Well yeah but then the downtime can also be an issue. it's good to stay warm but sometimes you need options for keeping busy and keeping active. connection no problem.
14589.0,Patient,No i'm back i'm back.
408.0,Provider,Good now. Okay. I hear you.
14589.0,Patient,Right we're moving.
408.0,Provider,"So another thing you might want to focus on in the next couple of weeks is how you can do some of your you move some of your exercise equipment indoors for the winter, so you can still do some weightlifting."
14589.0,Patient,"Oh, thank my wife for that they have."
408.0,Provider,"No, you know they there's any space in the House for it."
14589.0,Patient,"Daddy. Daddy it'd be it'd be gargle it, so I wouldn't do that, like it."
408.0,Provider,"What about hand weights, are you say you had 25 and 10 pound weights, you could do stuff with that inside."
14589.0,Patient,yeah I still do sit ups push up.
408.0,Provider,Right.
14589.0,Patient,"You do them every day, you know."
408.0,Provider,"There you go. And where, could you put your hand weights and doors when it gets chilly outside. Where would be a place, you could keep those. Is your shed heated."
14589.0,Patient,No.
408.0,Provider,"No. Maybe I don't know i'm just brainstorming here, maybe you could get your wife involved in some of the weightlifting and that way she'd be more open to you, bringing the hand weights and doors when it gets cold. You looking at me like i'm crazy."
14589.0,Patient,yeah that's not gonna happen.
408.0,Provider,Now what's the barrier to her lifting a 10 pound hand way.
14589.0,Patient,"I wouldn't dare ask a question, but I just think she wouldn't do you know."
408.0,Provider,Okay well. exercise is actually great therapy.
14589.0,Patient,yeah this is yeah it is really great through.
408.0,Provider,"This so when you when you combine exercise with the counseling with the. medication assisted treatment, you know it can be pretty powerful."
14589.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
408.0,Provider,"All right now, where to as we get to a next stage of our session here, we did say today, we were going to do your trauma hierarchy, because you noted that you had had some ptsd possible possible ptsd from some trauma events that occurred. In your past right. Yes, and I let you know that there are several forms of therapy counseling that have been found to be effective in treating those trauma events so they don't. affect your life as much in the present so you can put them in the past, and you can retrain your brain to put them in the past."
14589.0,Patient,yeah i've been trying to.
408.0,Provider,"Good so as part of starting that particular therapy strategy modality, we said what we're going to do today is step, one which is to make a hierarchy a trauma hierarchy. and identify what are the events, the trauma events that still trigger you now the most frequently. And when we identify those then those are the ones we're going to start working on with the prolonged exposure therapy. which has been found to decrease the effect that it has on your life currently in addition to your deciding to try to let them go, but this is a specific brain retraining therapy. So, of the things that have happened, what are the ones that you're still having bad dreams about or popping into your mind when you see or hear or smell something maybe that reminds you of it. Or maybe you're even having flashbacks or maybe you lose time sometimes when things trigger you. what's the most ruthless that comes up that way for us to."
14589.0,Patient,really just thinking about it.
408.0,Provider,At the which one thinking about which one is the most.
14589.0,Patient,"boring jail again you're thinking about the time I was in chief you know, I was."
408.0,Provider,Being in jail.
14589.0,Patient,"yeah like I was so stressed out at the time, and you know. Now I just needed like I don't know us do you think about all the time, you know."
408.0,Provider,"So, when you say you think about yet what specifically are you remember what what events are you remember, are you remembering the day that you got. The court hearing that you were sentence, are you thinking, like the day you walked into job, what is the typical that."
14589.0,Patient,"I don't know just I just think they took my like I can i'm just saying i'd be thinking now like, I remember when I couldn't dream, you know I mean. At all right. I don't know man. Just just just lose the freedom don't know."
408.0,Provider,"Okay. let's narrow it down to something that tends to trigger the thought of losing your freedom, right now, or any bad dreams, you had in the last week about losing your freedom."
14589.0,Patient,just watch TV sometimes get it.
408.0,Provider,"You know. All right, so what kind of TV for that."
14589.0,Patient,"Just about any kind of telling me, you know, like when I see jail sentence you don't eat me you get to you know."
408.0,Provider,When you see why don't even.
14589.0,Patient,When I see jail scenes and stuff on TV.
408.0,Provider,"jail Okay, so a physical. jail bars. or a jail cell, or are you thinking about if you see a prisoner in uniform which one is the most triggering."
14589.0,Patient,"Just a prisoner in uniform, you know. You know."
408.0,Provider,"So that would be the most triggering for you, wherever you see it, whether it's on TV or you're thinking about it."
14589.0,Patient,"yeah just seeing know team, or whatever you know."
408.0,Provider,"gotcha now what's the second what's The second thing that is still bothering you the most maybe you had a bad dream about it, or you feel bad what makes you think about bad things."
14589.0,Patient,just talking about just talking about it sometimes you know.
408.0,Provider,"Talking about having been incarcerated. yep okay. Well, and of course some of that is just the nature of post traumatic stress disorder, Mr Pearson is within our particular part of the brain it's right here on the side on both sides, called the hippocampus. The function of that part of our brain is to remember hold on to traumatic events. are still happening. And that's why, when you have this disorder, you can to avoid ever thinking about talking about it, because you believe that that will make it go away, unfortunately, it doesn't work that way it doesn't. It just. leaves you vulnerable right to being triggered. So, avoiding talking about unfortunately doesn't really work because you're still storing it. in real time as though it were happening now. You might say, and I don't know if you ever thought about this, but you might say why on earth is my brain doing this to me. Is that ever occurred to you. Because i'm trying and trying and trying to avoid it put it in the past, it still comes up."
14589.0,Patient,"yeah I put myself in a position, though, you know I mean."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so you feel you aren't you except some personal responsibility for that, but the reason it still happens appears to be a evolutionary, in other words humans who developed. To be to have certain brain abilities that help us to deal with threat with danger. Okay, does that make sense."
14589.0,Patient,yep.
408.0,Provider,"I mean every mammal right a dog a cat a horse all has ways to try to protect themselves from danger and threats right so originally. The hippocampus developed to hold on to memories. of threat to protect us in the future. So, for example, way back when humans first developed and we were hunter gatherers you know what I mean we we didn't even have farms yeah we just ran around and packs kind of and groups and we gathered berries and roots and we hunted animals for food and that's how we survived right. So back in the day right let's say we picked a berry and we ate it and it was poisonous and it made us really, really sick like really sick. Well, are you the campus. was designed to hold on to that memory, so the next time we saw that Bush, we would not pick those berries."
14589.0,Patient,"No, no."
408.0,Provider,We would not eat those barriers right.
14589.0,Patient,"No, I would."
408.0,Provider,See how that works.
14589.0,Patient,"yeah, but do you believe in like darwin's darwin's evolutionary thing right yeah."
408.0,Provider,"Well, he was not completely correct in his theory, but he got some things right. Now completely."
14589.0,Patient,"See you either, so you believe the man came from monkeys ah."
408.0,Provider,"No, no, no that's not it. No, but some of the principles of how different species survive. evolution well some of the principles appear to be correct, so, for example, as our climate heats up some species are developing longer legs and longer ears. Over many, many, many, many decades. which help them to be more heat resistant."
14589.0,Patient,You. yeah.
408.0,Provider,"I mean. yeah so that's not the same thing as saying that humans came from monkeys for it. But it's saying that there are there are some. elements of that theory that further science over time has found some evidence for. And this is one of them. That some of what you know some of the way our brain works can help us to hurt us that's it. So it can be helpful if we have a real threat in front of us like a poisonous mushroom or a poisonous berry and we learn to recognize. But if we have a threat that we learned and remembered that's not really a threat right now right this minute sometimes that hurts us, because we keep looking for it right, we keep being on guard against it. And we keep thinking it's going to happen any minute and that's really not true anymore."
14589.0,Patient,hmm.
408.0,Provider,But it keeps us always on the alert always. Waiting for the threat.
14589.0,Patient,ya know.
408.0,Provider,And that's what we call post traumatic stress disorder.
14589.0,Patient,"yeah I think I got it, but you know, like I got that I got that down Pat, but you know it's like. I don't think you ever get rid of real."
408.0,Provider,"Oh yeah you can you can it can be treated. In fact, we have very effective treatments for one of which is the one i've been telling you about prolonged exposure therapy it works extremely well."
14589.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"And it's developed over years, in fact, it even works extremely well for combat veterans who have been through hell and back."
14589.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,So. don't don't give up hope.
14589.0,Patient,and never we're. always trying to keep myself on the believer side.
408.0,Provider,"So, keeping that in mind what's the second most strong trigger for you, besides seeing something reminding you of a jail or prison uniform like on TV what else triggers you. Okay well."
14589.0,Patient,sirens yuki I hate to sound a key shake.
408.0,Provider,Your head shaking right. It makes sense right.
14589.0,Patient,that's about it yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Well now, when you say COPs you mean seeing a police officer correct."
14589.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
408.0,Provider,"So now, that is not, I mean that is a present danger to you. If you see what i'm saying. At some level. you're a black man in America."
14589.0,Patient,ya know.
408.0,Provider,"So that is not a that is a somewhat present danger, not just from past trauma so we're going to move that down on your trauma list. Okay, so that that that could use some work but probably you're still going to need to be realistically careful. And self aware and vigilant, yes."
14589.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"You see what i'm saying. So we're gonna move that down to number four on your trauma hierarchy because again it's like half from the past and half is a current possible threat that's realistic. But the key shaking the TV triggers the sirens yes let's start working on those as triggers and I think that you will find that, over time, you can recondition and habituate your brain to see that some of those reactions can be decreased and placed in the past. Those triggers can be realistically reduced without putting you in any you know vulnerable position. So that you're less triggered."
14589.0,Patient,I guess.
408.0,Provider,"What questions do you have, as we close out this session."
14589.0,Patient,"We don't have any questions I just like man, I think that you know, I was talking to my wife about it, because you said I had to talk to people about it, you know, and she was kind of understanding and listening to me of like any kind of hit me up you know."
408.0,Provider,yep yeah.
14589.0,Patient,We talked for a long time.
408.0,Provider,"yeah good. And so, which of these triggers did you find were reduced after you have that talk."
14589.0,Patient,"i'm just mostly just laughing and you know we laughing and stuff like that he or she kind of made me feel a little safer, you know."
