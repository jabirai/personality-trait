480.0,Provider,"yeah exactly is everyone feeling better, though."
4652.0,Patient,"Yes, thank God."
480.0,Provider,Okay.
4652.0,Patient,"And what's going on i'm Robert yes, I have my step son. who loves to be with me just because I give them a little bit more attention, and you know he can talk event and get everything out that he feels without being judged or you know so any type of way. yeah and. I had to bring him to the doctor, the other day looking crazy because. You can't send close to Roberts moms because she doesn't give them back or national say this whole Oh, there is none. Well, Robert just bought them close like three weeks ago spent four bucks. I know they have them. Right she sent me this message back and it sounded so sinister. Like. Man it's hard to explain it like what's your trick or like what are you up to now, or something and, unlike once."
480.0,Provider,that's what his mom said.
4652.0,Patient,"yeah, this is the diversion she is because she asked have control over the Ryan and caitlin and then caitlyn is a very disrespectful to me lately because apparently she was Cinderella and I never did anything wrong to her, but used her."
480.0,Provider,huh.
4652.0,Patient,You were 10. When you were living with me full time. You could wouldn't clean your room you refused never wash your dishes like you were supposed to never get a chore and still got everything you wanted. Am I missing something know. Out of grandmothers now.
480.0,Provider,yeah exactly that's all I was gonna say she's she was.
4652.0,Patient,"On the one on the wrong and then she tells Robert last night that I cursed there her, and all this, I said that's okay that's why I sent her voice messages, so I could prove. How I spoke yeah and that's a shame, I have to do that. yeah but I spoke very calm and very like I didn't say a curse word was very calm and collect because I can't get myself worked up with her anymore, because this is like six years in the making it's old already."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4652.0,Patient,"You know you get tired of it, you know a good 50% of my relation was ruined because her her. yeah not saying all of it, but a good 50% yeah you know the troublemaking and all that, like it's just like like, for instance, last night, like, I never cursed to you, so why are you lying. And I shirt said i'll send you every message I never want to i'll send the messages from her and myself. I never once cursed. Not one time. what's Robert minute to."
480.0,Provider,If he's still in Jersey.
4652.0,Patient,"No he's not oh my God he's all the way out somewhere in the middle now where's he was in Kansas, and then I think he's in Texas now okay. But it's just frustrating to have a 57 year old lady always after you because of two kids because the obsession, and like i'm always so bad with them like this has been an ongoing saying for like. I thought I had a hiccup but it won't come out. Like where is it. um and it's just frustrating at this point and it's old i've always made every holiday special every birthday special like i've never treated them bad. yeah they want to hear him say like Oh, maybe you gave them a reason to treat you like that, like first of all, as a parent that's not okay second of all that's incorrect."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4652.0,Patient,You know. And i'm just still like with this whole like my one mistake equals out to his millions of mistakes and every little thing that i've ever did the nitpicking. From the one to be single like you have a family you're getting old you want to be single because you want to be around and do whatever you feel like you're going to get tired of that eventually.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
4652.0,Patient,"and You know i'm holding on only because when I made that commitment, it was unconditional and I opened up and open up to nobody. hmm so now it's hard for me now to close it again. And it's just been really struggling and like really. sleep loss like constant being upset like. You know, maybe these people's new things differently, but they used to bend over backwards to try to please everybody and I guess it was for nothing."
480.0,Provider,"Well it's Not for nothing, the problem is when you do that, then you start ignoring and neglecting your own needs, and you have nobody taking care of you, and then you get to a point where. you're on empty all the time because nobody's taking care of you and you're giving every part of you to everyone else."
4652.0,Patient,"is about right. sounds about right what's the matter to them. And then, like therapy thing and first of all, you need to go back and cyber no Dag on short it's freezing. Nice clothes kid. yeah don't forget room cleaning today. getting out of it like yesterday. Which one on one is. Look i've raccoon eyes i'm so tired like i've barely slept like just. At all yeah like it just doesn't want to shut off. Like."
480.0,Provider,Thinking about.
4652.0,Patient,"This everything like what went wrong, what did I do wrong, which I know I didn't do anything wrong like. Like how bad I am why wasn't I good enough and things like this and, like there was just so many opportunities for me to go and opportunities for him to say it, and it didn't happen and it just made it worse. and making stupid Comments like about other females, how they look in this not like you know you might think it's a joke, to you, but it's not to me."
480.0,Provider,Right that's really hurtful.
4652.0,Patient,"Very. Then I have a camera shoved in my face oh to watch the door, but the other camera I know for a fact sees the door and sees the driveway no I can't call him my room and cry. Thank you for your suggestion, but it's because then it my kids see me crying they want to know what's wrong."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's where you have to focus your attention when you start thinking about wanting to stay with him is that your kids are also suffering it's not just you."
4652.0,Patient,But what bothers me is it's fixable that's What irritates me.
480.0,Provider,How do you feel like it's fixable.
4652.0,Patient,Like it was always suzette throngs is that's the crazy she needs help blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay well years later therapists later I think it's not my turn anymore.
480.0,Provider,"Well, but that's What I mean is, we can't force anyone else to change, and so, if he's the problem that's not fixable that's not in your control and you also can't expect that he's ever going to change."
4652.0,Patient,But he just he wasn't always like that.
480.0,Provider,"No, but sometimes people are good at hiding things for a while."
4652.0,Patient,It wasn't always like that I just feel like I met him when he was separated from his kids mom. And I feel like he didn't heal enough from that and I kind of got. The short end of the stick because of that. yeah and I feel like the love that I gave I didn't get the same amount.
480.0,Provider,Which is probably very accurate very true.
4652.0,Patient,You know if you're willing to stand in front of a bullet for somebody that says a lot.
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4652.0,Patient,But I know it won't be the other way around.
480.0,Provider,Right and that's the part that you can't expect that to ever change.
4652.0,Patient,"Unfortunately, you can't make people go back to who they were."
480.0,Provider,No nope not at all.
4652.0,Patient,"Never wore necklaces or any type of jewelry earrings sometimes. Now, getting gold chains, and all this stuff like one of the one is like slick a midlife crisis."
480.0,Provider,Maybe.
4652.0,Patient,Then the way this mom is speaking to me and getting away with it like he was you were supposed to bring him back like. i've raised these kids too.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's why I feel like the mom having so much to say to you, all of a sudden it's probably because she sees that her son is acting out and she doesn't have control over him so she's trying to exercise whatever control, she has over you."
4652.0,Patient,"Oh she's always want to control over them, even when when they first got here and they were little. They will come and snuggle in bed with me and she would. She would tell them to come here and like pretty much take them out of the bit. They can't love anybody else but her."
480.0,Provider,Which is so unhealthy as a grandparent like.
4652.0,Patient,"You know, and I want Ryan, and I want to paste back and forth, and all the things he talks to me about. And it makes me feel bad that like i'm the only person he feels like he could talk to. And then I put him against his dad or or or his grandma, and all this and that's not true, I just got frustrated one day because he's trying to voice how he feels and everybody's ignoring him. yeah insane it's because of me. And that's not true, like this stupid game in front of me can vouch for that, when he sits here and talks to me I don't even open my mouth. I just listen yeah. You know it's a marriage, he has and all that I hear him screaming at night."
480.0,Provider,How old is he.
4652.0,Patient,"The amount to be 13. You know that really bothered tears me up so bad, because I know how fields. I just know how it feels when I was his age. You shouldn't have to feel that way. He shouldn't have to feel that if he picked one or the other, that he's going to lose one."
480.0,Provider,Exactly.
4652.0,Patient,"Indeed down on not their mom yeah I know that I was reminded that, for the past eight years. And there's so many people that Mary other people or get with other people that have other kids and don't have to deal with this. In my kids are confused and like that our families like separated and it's not normal. And I feel like now i'm like i'm just being like. Not being nice to but like kind of just dealing with me, so I can take them to the doctors and do their stuff and all that so, then they can get buttons goal."
480.0,Provider,And then meetings and again.
4652.0,Patient,"Because i'm the only one that does it caitlin says, I made her Cinderella like you know you're dating That is because i've heard them words before from Naomi, which was the older one Naomi acted out a lot, but I understood why."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4652.0,Patient,"And took me a long time to not interact and engage each. You know, or to fight about it. You know, because imagine having a child in your face screaming at uconn your bitch and in all these words and names and you're the one, taking care of them physically and financially."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4652.0,Patient,"it's a lot. You know, but eventually you know, like I would do the same thing, because I just wanted to be with my mom nobody will listen to me, but two years later, now all of a sudden i'm right. I just feel like that."
480.0,Provider,"It shouldn't and that's The difference is, you see the big picture, and you see like how this is going to affect them in the long run, I feel like Robert and his mom either don't see it or don't care and are just self centered and seeing what they get out of it, you know. When I think he doesn't want to deal with it."
4652.0,Patient,yeah like his mom called him last night that kind of like try to get me and him to fight like she always does. I never said one word. You can't be serious. yeah and i'm going to send them all the messages because that's not fair.
480.0,Provider,No it's not.
4652.0,Patient,Her.
480.0,Provider,Which kids how many of his kids are living with you still or are they all with his mom.
4652.0,Patient,Ryan just came here well caitlin was with me for almost a year. yeah but I treat her awful. But I could never get her to go back to her grandma's.
480.0,Provider,"Well, because she felt safe with you. yeah."
4652.0,Patient,"But all the sudden now I was so bad to her, but for a week straight when my mom was here visiting I wanted all the kids to go there, and so I can figure something out of the get rid of my mom because of the way she was acting wasn't healthy."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4652.0,Patient,"caitlin would throw a damn sick. And I would call his mom every time. And like she couldn't even have the audacity to stand up for me and be like yeah she tried to bring her hair, but she didn't want to like."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4652.0,Patient,"Like because I didn't involve a basket and close my house and clean or it's like every day, I feel like there's another thing to pick up me about. You know, Dan people make mistakes in my small mistake is not even close. To the three you made, and then Dover gave you."
480.0,Provider,what's the one mistake that. he's focusing on of years.
4652.0,Patient,"Every day, something different first is smoking because I stopped smoke. which if I wanted to I could stop in a minute. But what would nothing's going to change."
480.0,Provider,But those are mistakes like that's The difference is that.
4652.0,Patient,"Well, because I quit and I started again."
480.0,Provider,So he has. He has an issue with. A behavior.
4652.0,Patient,But he meant me as a smoker.
480.0,Provider,"But that's what I mean it's like in a relationship. You can't try to change someone else you can't try to change their behaviors their thoughts their feelings their actions, so if he's expecting you to do X, Y amp Z."
4652.0,Patient,To be I want something. I want some change on the other end then.
480.0,Provider,"it's not fair and it's not practical and it's not ever going to lead to a successful relationship. Because unless you accept the person, exactly as they are in this current moment and love them unconditionally for that and there's another thing too is you can love someone unconditionally and still not put up with certain behaviors."
4652.0,Patient,"And i've loved him, no matter what he did, unfortunately, and this is where God me. Side like a visa dress. It is no fair Oh, because I don't listen when he talks because the thing with your mom lives and what else and then Naomi and her what gang up on me and like it would call them fight all the time that's a good 50% of the reason why we had so many issues, to begin with. You know, and it was just not fair and I always do it, and I put up with it, they put up with it. But why might be in big depart."
480.0,Provider,Right.
4652.0,Patient,My son oh when's the last time you took him to the dentist he still little he hasn't even lost a tooth yet.
480.0,Provider,Right.
4652.0,Patient,But his two bigger ones i've been waiting for a letter to be written to give me consent to date them i've been waiting for that for almost two years.
480.0,Provider,"And it's called mid world, I mean the majority of the population has not been regularly to the dentist the past two years anyways."
4652.0,Patient,"But that's the thing, though, like he keeps saying all the things that I haven't done Oh, they haven't been to the doctor and this long of that but. don't forget when I stopped working because you asked me to, because the kids were in school, and they were failing because they were at his mom's. And they also failed a couple years ago back as well, because they were at his moms and they actually felt that time and were held back if it wasn't for me being up there, but and like making them do the extra work they wouldn't even have passed."
480.0,Provider,"On I think the common theme here is regardless of what you do it's never going to be acceptable or enough for him, which means it's not about you it's about him."
4652.0,Patient,"Right nothing's ever going to be acceptable. nothing's ever gonna be enough, but how. Like the day he cheated and knock the girl up and I found out like the day that I even gave you a chance men. Like Okay, this is your chance like tell me what you want to do so, you can do what you need to do, and if you're going to go, then you can go. Like why try get on even more but i'm not allowed to mention it i'm not allowed to be upset about it, oh we're gonna dress the girls up as ballerinas because that's the theme of the party like Mike is never got it that."
480.0,Provider,We.
4652.0,Patient,"Go we're gonna wear a magic T shirts like. And you tell me these things, and you tell me like as if I was retarded. Do I want my kids to go no Absolutely not. But they have another sibling unfortunately and I can't be selfish. You know, but then tell me the other day, like Oh, you should have measured your words, because the lady know, like me, because I told her when she goes trip over a rock well you know what guess what I lost my baby was she got the key birds."
480.0,Provider,there's a lot of grief.
4652.0,Patient,"And a lot of what like don't even sure if. He knew we were together, it was they used to talk all the time and I always told him and made me feel uncomfortable like something just isn't normal about that. And, little by little, I just keep finding she like five years ago him saying oh too bad, you have a boyfriend is that the third like well you're with somebody."
480.0,Provider,yeah okay.
4652.0,Patient,"Go to rehab you bring some random female in my house and sleeps with her in my bed, and I find this out years later. I actually found it out, six months after it came out of rehab when I went to go print pictures out I find pictures of them standing by the fence hugging each other, and then the kids go oh that's samantha. Like."
480.0,Provider,that's so painful.
4652.0,Patient,"No, but agreed david's not it's not at all."
480.0,Provider,Because he's abusive and. narcissistic and gaslighting you like this.
4652.0,Patient,"Post it and then. All the shit that happened with his mom and then Naomi i'm always like I have to defend myself So yes, as soon as i'm being accusers soon as I hear someone trying to say. On this and i'm this and i'm bad and all that yeah, the first thing I think oh my God, I have to defend myself like i'm literally traumatized over that. has nothing to do it, though, like the dog."
480.0,Provider,"know it says, like you said it's a trauma response because you haven't been validated and a lot of years."
4652.0,Patient,"I never asked for anything yeah. I did my own things I made sure I made money. I mean ask him for a couple hours here and there, that's not at least you know that's normal. Well, I asked was be paid a debt to do and just. Just given attention and act like you care. But if you didn't like you should have said it, I remember one time it was like four years ago, like, I went to grab this phone in the couple whose mind wouldn't work and we would get a fucking tree from him grabbing it."
480.0,Provider,wow. that's really bad.
4652.0,Patient,"And then the girl tells me on whether there's more than other there's other girls that he slept with besides me and everything and that woman is said, from then is all true everything has come out to be true, so I have no reason to believe her now. Oh marriage and a House well don't hold your breath. wait a long time. You know, and then it's hard for me to agree we're doing I need to do, because then I have kids I have to daycare for him, you can just jump into drug can be done with it."
480.0,Provider,yeah he gets to lean.
4652.0,Patient,"On my going to kiss his moms. But for a babysitter she gets so much money, it means that I literally it's like paying a babysitter. Oh, I was getting food stamps and I wasn't bringing her every single month she got more than half. More than half when I wasn't getting them anymore, which I don't know why something hasn't gives me a feeling it's her, she wouldn't try to apply for shit hopefully knocks now they lost all their medicaid."
480.0,Provider,How they lose their medicaid.
4652.0,Patient,"Hopefully, they didn't but she went and tried to put my son on her least then she put the other big kids on or at least you know well for finds out about that I get a lot of trouble. i'm taking the malls. Know Bobby can play outside right now but. not yet one mommy's done okay. And i'll make your chicken nugget. me Sir there's still going forward and backwards."
480.0,Provider,backup.
4652.0,Patient,"Long Okay, I promise let's play outside he gets bored what. isn't the way he did to front of his teeth one spots turning Brown and indicate in the front, because now, I find out he's drinking chocolate milk was sucking sugar and at nighttime and a sippy Cup. seven."
480.0,Provider,Oh wow.
4652.0,Patient,"But now it's not her fault it's my fault, because I have to take them to the dense well cove it's been happening, and you know but doing everything else."
480.0,Provider,"Right, you have a lot of other kids and yourself to take care of."
4652.0,Patient,"Like dang. Oh, my God, and it was his mom that caught their appointment is on the third teeth. The boys are at 230 the girls are a. that's when the appointment is i've said it so many times that it's insane but listen, I will drop them back off to your mom's if this is going to be such a headache continuously. I never cursed and never argue, and I say very nice and calm and I have all my messages still because I already knew, she was going to try to live because God forbid. someone tries to intervene with her with the kids that she's got to have hostage it's just crazy i'll just bring him back if it's going to be for all this i'll bring them back. Just can't handle it. Not who's going to be for all this."
480.0,Provider,So. That was Robert so he's the one.
4652.0,Patient,"yeah but I told his mom yesterday 1000 times. And the end them grandmother that I got them mixed up the girls and the boys are not the very same time I made it did it by mistake. You know, and then the little girls tell me well, you got to bring me right there and back the doctors offices five minutes down the street, Christine I have to drive 2530 minutes out of my way to go, get her then bring her all the way back. Please a child. Because they believe her life, I wish they could look me up though good damn lie detector test like I swear I really wish I could be hooked up the one I really do."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and but that's even the bigger point is you shouldn't even have to be. proving to anybody. That you're telling the truth and actually."
4652.0,Patient,"Be on my end, it should be on the Reverend."
480.0,Provider,Right and especially someone you're in a relationship with like.
4652.0,Patient,"I wasn't even allowed to ask questions. Especially when he was in Jersey, it would always make me uncomfortable. Right of course i'm going to ask questions of course i'm going to feel some type of way. Sorry, forgive me. To be an inconvenience."
480.0,Provider,hmm so. Where are we at with the whole like getting out of the relationship.
4652.0,Patient,"don't even know, but this thing was mom I can't take it. Now, and it's not fair to Ryan I go bring him back and now he said, like it's not right. Scott right."
480.0,Provider,It doesn't sound like this situation is benefiting anybody it's not benefiting.
4652.0,Patient,"Your but the big. The person that is in the middle and the person, that is, the absolutely 1,000,000% problem is his mom."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and him, though, to."
4652.0,Patient,"You have to remember laughing it. He knows that they're going to fail, he knows it for a fact it's not one time but twice he knows it. And he's going to allow this anyway. yeah my son's not going to fail. my daughter ain't gonna fail neither. So if I got to rearrange my work schedule that i'm here to get them off that damn but believe me i'll be here."
480.0,Provider,hmm.
4652.0,Patient,"But to set them up for failure like that she can't read it right nobody's going to help them she used to make the older sister Naomi which No wonder the kid was bitter and sour. They came to live with me before she wanted to leave in but we always fought me, and I only because she thought she was grown sneaking out the window sneaking guys through my window."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4652.0,Patient,"You know what no hell no girl. You know, but it was for discipline reasons, not for reasons of anything bad, but the story is always twisted choose that will be if you tell Roberts who's that's wrong. who believes them. frame how have a horrible feeling to feel that way yep it's not right. Just doesn't it's not fair and either. Like saying hello, I said I was in therapy, so that means I don't want to be interrupted."
480.0,Provider,"But again, he does not give two shits about your needs or your wants or anything. That has to do with you, which is the problem is he's not going to."
4652.0,Patient,"You know, first the car first the car is a gift the cars used to drive the kids around in his mother around everywhere, but I stopped. Some of the kids went and bought video games, this is the worst part of it all. The kids went and bought video games and we're buying like little dollar games on a phone as well, and it was adding up and adding up and they wanted to take him like a ton of money out of this woman's account. The grandmother, but she lied the robber I never gave them my bank card if she did they told on her right in front of everybody. And guess whose name was on those transaction because guess, who was the one that set the switch up. You yes. got the bank ready to call the police on me and press charges."
480.0,Provider,What for something kids did that's insane.
4652.0,Patient,"know what we were I finally figured out what was the problem, because the purchases are they're all in black and white. yeah and it's been happening, but this time they got breathes and did bigger purchases, but two years ago, when I got my taxes. Even though, and my taxes that money was for bills and then I put the rest of my savings. caitlin took it upon herself to Adam. There 300 some dollars afterwards. Then, decided to spend it all on herself."

At this point I don't want to take any other than to Dr. Isabel needed a new debit card. She wanted me to take her the next day. know because three days before that you talk shit about me you talk so bad about me to these two older kids not even funny. yeah and Ryan tells me as the everything when I mean everything that boy tells me every single thing that was said everything that happens, but I don't go and say oh Ryan said blah blah blah blah, you know I keep it to myself."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and just think of the damage it's doing the kids for her to be. Bad mouthing you to them directly."
4652.0,Patient,Nobody sees that. i'm always wrong i'm always bad. You know I try every day to get up and I try and push myself a barely sleep at night I don't like it's just hard. The minute I heard why every time you call my mom you got a curse what. Why every time your mom cautious ally.
480.0,Provider,yep.
4652.0,Patient,"She knew in the appointment, or because I said and she's good she's over there, pretending I never said it that I had them they're waiting had caitlin they're waiting ready I guarantee that's what was said."
480.0,Provider,You mean today.
4652.0,Patient,"Then she would tell me things about things about Robert cheat and and things like that, but she would tell me now why the Fuck you didn't tell me before you're not telling me because you give a damn you're telling me to fucking hurt me."
480.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and that's what I mean, like all of their behaviors and actions and everything they say are out of either self centeredness or self preservation."
4652.0,Patient,He goes and tells Robert that I say all these bad things about him none of it's true. yeah none of it. Just took me up to a damn testing damn.
480.0,Provider,Right gonna lie detector.
4652.0,Patient,You can feel like 100 or 200 bucks and i'm literally I wanted to do it.
480.0,Provider,don't do that even the bigger.
4652.0,Patient,"know why I want to do it, you know I want to do it, so I want everybody to feel like a piece of shit afterwards."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4652.0,Patient,But they want to be treated the way i'm being treated. I don't deserve it.
480.0,Provider,"You don't, but I also know these types of people in this behavior and even with a lie detector they're still going to somehow find a way to make you the problem. Which that's like the main theme and all of this is there is no way they're ever going to admit to them being the problem."
4652.0,Patient,"You know, and he knew a little bit of a lot of my backstory. To have such a broken person that doesn't even open up to family doesn't open up like completely closed every door in their life and their heart and everywhere to everyone. And to open up to you. You you need to feel special. Because nobody else got that. And it was used and abused."
480.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
4652.0,Patient,"And i'm not saying i'm an angel. i've never cheated. Never. I don't sit in and talk about sexual things the man's all day. So that my other person can see it. don't make fun of that to other people, so they can see it."
480.0,Provider,that's so much abuse.
4652.0,Patient,"They just get like it's always about everybody everybody else's feelings, but it's never been about my feelings never."
480.0,Provider,"And that's what you deserve as someone who's going to make your feelings, a priority and your needs a priority."
4652.0,Patient,"even want to be with anybody else like it just after that I just want to be. want to be alone because I won't trust anybody after that. You know I did my G like oh I don't i'm not progressing in life, how how much faster you want me to go. sorry that I have mental health problems i'm sorry that I had a drug addiction in my BATs."
480.0,Provider,And also outward productivity is not an indicator of progression or growth right so. you're telling me what i'm doing when they're not here i'm tired of people telling me.
4652.0,Patient,"That everything I do is wrong when you're not year. yeah so what the houses and sparkling first of all, this mother fucking piece of shit it's falling apart. To begin with, grow and black mold in the corner grown black mold under the fucking St which I am highly allergic do. it's like it, I don't even get it. Like what did I ever do so bad to deserve to be treated this way. When I was pregnant with my daughter gabby like he leaves and bs with this other girl and then she said she was pregnant with twins but he found out that it wasn't hers please her and comes back and once the work it out like I should have said no. I should have just said no. i've already paid back for anything i've ever taken from him or anything i've ever done wrong like in my in my use, I mean i've what i've done, given that bag and then sub. is getting continue to go on like this. Like i'm tired of an elderly woman telling me what I say i'm tired of someone telling me how I feel i've done yo I feel good you don't know. You know, in my head."
480.0,Provider,they're not there either and that's the other difference is they're not even there with you.
4652.0,Patient,"So much a pig and all this actually is the complete opposite. i'm actually very organized person, but after everything happened like i'm really suffering. So sorry I don't feel amusement going full glows at least I watched them. You just can't make somebody understand how you feel without without the guilt party. Oh, if i'm so bad at all this like it has nothing to do with that. You think because it was two years ago, you get over it, no."
480.0,Provider,So what can you do today to. Help feel more grounded.
4652.0,Patient,"I feel bad for Ryan like and I don't want to take it back over there he's in a room all day does nothing. Well, she nitpicks him for every little thing and i've seen it for my own eyes. The things that he tells me is not lb. But it's like I. Like I can't do anything."
480.0,Provider,You have to bring him back over today.
4652.0,Patient,I can't do a desert harassment thing about the doctor that you know this like you know what if she has so much to say she can do it. All but that's ricci Qin. The car was a gift. it's a gift to have to be doing chores and savers for people that treat me terrible.
480.0,Provider,And oh yeah yeah.
4652.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to take it, I will gladly walk on my. own two feet until I get another vehicle. yeah I don't have a ton of money saved up and things like that, because I was supporting it all, you want to open this business Okay, you want to open this one okay. I was always a backbone and support, but when it comes to my end it's it's not the same. And I just want the person that I met back. You can't tell me about how you don't trust me when you lost that trust from me, when you did when you did the first time, and I even got over it then and I gave you trust back. it's like you, you want to get your point across the you'll still can say the same things over and over and over again, but you know, deep down you're never going to get it across you're never going to get anybody to realize how you feel nobody cares nobody gives a damn how you feel. Speak to absolutely nobody, not one human soul, a day you deal with things all by yourself."
480.0,Provider,And that's something that is possible to change it's just surrounding yourself with different people that are genuine and trustworthy and.
4652.0,Patient,"loyal never left my job until I had another one which I was going to have another one, but I just should have never left my job for what I think nothing I didn't get a gratitude no nothing. I have gratitude for what I have i'm not even realistic burden, because I had so much at one point and I lost it all. And it it really hurt, but you know what I got it all back and then some it can be replaced you can't replace Bebo."
480.0,Provider,You can't replace people.
4652.0,Patient,"Finding somebody that loves you unconditionally to the point where they will go above and beyond, for you is very hard to find. This has nothing to do with me and my gut feelings right it's always right, I don't give a damn what anybody says like this is just a go fucking around. me. Really."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, I do have to let you go, because I have another appointment, but I want to know how you're gonna stay sane today."
4652.0,Patient,"Because i'm too exhausted and I can't play keep playing into it it's too much it's exhausting and. My kids love to make a mess and i'll be busy cleaning and i'm just not going to play into it. it's either I taken their I don't know, on top of that, they have to be transferred to a schooner as well, I cannot do all of that they've already been transfer five times, Christine they're going to call CPS."
