383.0,Provider,"Well, you made it today i'm glad i'm glad for that. that's good too yeah. So what do you feel like you want to work on, I know we've been talking about you know structuring your time and. Focusing on that, how is that going."
12468.0,Patient,"that's going well. I am. I had some things I needed to take care of for school and I was kind of procrastinating and putting them off and. It just kind of made me feel really guilty and like worried and anytime I tried to do something fun to like enjoy myself, I had that like looming over me. But I got that done. Friday like first thing last Friday, and then I enjoyed myself and the the the Friday I had was so much more enjoyable when I didn't have anything to like stress me out so that was a cool thing. Taking a little shot of new topics they helped me think. Sorry, is it bad."
383.0,Provider,"No well so. that's good information for you that you know that's important to listen to it's like. Okay, I did this, I took care of business and then I was able to relax more freely. I think that you know in our conversations you kind of. You know and it's that sort of addictive pattern, let me go to what feels good right away, you know, rather than. delayed gratification do what needs to be done first and then enjoy."
12468.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,So do you feel like you're making that. Like it's. you're going to try to make that more of a habit or.
12468.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. it's just difficult for some reason to do that to kind of implement it. Today I got up really early and that felt good. didn't really it wasn't really productive, but actually got really sleepy and then I took a nap but. yeah."
383.0,Provider,it's good you got up. So that's that's great does that different than the norm.
12468.0,Patient,"Well, been a little earlier lately. And just have a hard time like making my mornings productive I know we talked about like making a calendar and. sort of drawing or writing down like what I should do for the day but um I don't know it's just hard to. stick to it, I guess. Like that you. described it as like a muscle though a minds kind of like atrophied right now so just needs to be like worked up. But that's really struggle for me to get. To get it working."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well there's good habits and then there's. Unfortunately, I mean there's less. there's habits that can get us into trouble over time."
12468.0,Patient,yeah for sure. For sure.
383.0,Provider,"So habits this topic of habits and good habits. You know, a habit is. Something that you do every. You know that the habit of like brushing your teeth. At night or."
12468.0,Patient,Trying to go to bed early.
383.0,Provider,yeah. it's like establishing a new pattern establishing a new. thing that you just do.
12468.0,Patient,"requires around. yeah I think I am establishing like some good habits. That virtual reality meditation thing I tried to do that before bed, and if you do it like once a day it keeps track of your. Your streak and i'm up to like. Almost 50 days now, or something and that streak keeps me like in check with this kind of new habit. i'm like oh gosh it's 11 o'clock or 1030 or whatever, I have to go to bed, I have to get in bed and. Do my thing, so I can keep my street going and then that makes me so tired because i'm meditating in bed with the lights are that makes me so tired that it's like time for bed after that, so I think that's how i'm able to be week early now."
383.0,Provider,"press, so you kind of you know, found a way to get yourself going with that."
12468.0,Patient,yeah kind of snuck its way in. I like it.
383.0,Provider,"How are things going at home, how are you finding your you know living situation at home."
12468.0,Patient,"Okay um has its pros and cons for sure I think it's nice to. Not have like the normal stresses of my. Average adult life like how I had it in Chico I think that was really like killing me trying to work and, like pay bills and bike around, especially when it's like cold and wet out. That was really difficult so it's Nice, not to have to do those things, but I do think that those things helped me to like grow. But. it's nice to be around my family and it's not nice to be around my family's. We butt heads, but they're good they're good bunch of people so. glad to have them."
383.0,Provider,and How do you feel like you're doing in terms of progressing in your sobriety.
12468.0,Patient,I feel good and even hadn't been dreams about like alcohol or cigarettes or anything.
383.0,Provider,Oh good that's progress.
12468.0,Patient,yeah my dreams are usually have like school and not not doing so well there was like a big project that I don't. understand everyone else was kind of like what's wrong with this guy we've been talking about this all year everyone gets it and I don't when I wake up feeling really like scared but no drugs no alcohol.
383.0,Provider,So that's big that's a big shift from when I spoke with you last.
12468.0,Patient,"yeah just kind of a pain in the ass last time couldn't get them out of my head. And I guess that is good, I didn't."
383.0,Provider,notice.
12468.0,Patient,That snuck its way into.
383.0,Provider,What are you getting out of being in the groups are you how are the groups for you.
12468.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm. One person in a group of like. Maybe republican like trump supporters. They like hunting and yeah I don't know what he is he's not like counselor but chuck the guy who like leads the group. haha is always talking about like guns and and the army and things like that it's just kind of like my brain doesn't relate to it, so it can't. Oh no I don't really feel connected with them very much."
383.0,Provider,Okay well that's good.
12468.0,Patient,yeah we.
383.0,Provider,"know how that can is very helpful for your recovery, if you go to a group and you don't feel like it's a safe place for you to share or you don't feel a sense of connection."
12468.0,Patient,"yeah it's really weird I don't was kind of brainstorming like. What would be my smart thing. To do. Would talk to about a thing like that. No, no, no don't feel like chantelle would understand because she seems like she's part of it, like she's very. She just went to like this Christian Catholic festival thing and that's cool like good for you, if you do that thing, and you enjoy it my grandma's Catholic she's a great woman, but it's just not my cup of tea. Then yeah I just I don't know I usually just sit back and listen during gifts."
383.0,Provider,"um. Okay well how are you supporting yourself in your sobriety I mean, do you think you might want to add a group, like going to. A na group online, so that you can kind of get more more. yeah. More connection more actual real like. interactions that are helpful I."
12468.0,Patient,"think that would be nice, I think the only thing I really get out of my weekly groups is you know, seeing how bad it can get for some people just kind of makes you go wow I feel for those people that's. that's a real bummer when you feel like you're not doing well, and then you see how bad like the can actually get like. kind of a wake up call."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
12468.0,Patient,So that's nice but yeah maybe it'd be cool to have an additional. Something.
383.0,Provider,"Have you been on have you like, do you think that maybe you could do a little bit of research to see what's available in your area for like finding and like an na online na group."
12468.0,Patient,I think that would be a nice project something to keep busy with.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's put that down. As a goal for you."
12468.0,Patient,"yeah hopefully I could find something. like this, so difficult to get around."
383.0,Provider,um yeah how are you doing with your bike riding.
12468.0,Patient,"haven't really hopped on it, but i've been walking a lot, because I have a. prolapsed. bulging vein in my. hemorrhoids where you're really bad one, and it's i'm. Usually, you can just kind of treat them yourself and they go away, but that hasn't been the case this time around, so trying to walk more because I understand that that is good for it. it's a lot of blood flow I guess. Not a whole lot of bike riding, but a lot of walking."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay good good i'm glad you're getting exercise and walking and did you ever make an appointment to see a doctor about the chest to your chest area and. Oh. Okay, Chris. Like you gotta do this."
12468.0,Patient,"yeah it's really important, because my body's starting to fall apart um. yeah I really need a PCP to check the cell because. it's like totally prolapsed like outside of. Where it needs to be and it's extremely painful."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, so you have. Something on your chest, that is extremely painful."

383.0,Provider,"I mean that's really like pain and a condition and then you've got your chest, to write to you you'd mentioned you've got some. Some. routing and stuff that's not. healed up."
12468.0,Patient,very odd.
383.0,Provider,"we're a you know if you had a like a little pet that you love that had some. These problems, and you are ignoring that party animal you would not be you would feel badly about that wouldn't you. yeah. Putting words in your mouth, which I shouldn't. Do it wouldn't be I should not be doing that, but."
12468.0,Patient,doing what.
383.0,Provider,I see putting words in your mouth i'm.
12468.0,Patient,"You know no I like the way you're You helped me understand the situation, I think that was really helpful to see it that way, I. don't want to ignore like your baby or your child or your pets, so why would you ignore your your body."
383.0,Provider,"hi hi yourself. yeah yeah, which is essentially what you've been doing since. For many months now."
12468.0,Patient,Oh yeah no longer than that. I laughed but it's not funny it's very serious I should call.
383.0,Provider,So.
12468.0,Patient,"I have insurance I don't know. You just for it. Go ahead, I thought I thought it was like the depression that was keeping me back holding you back from doing these things but i'm taking twice my dose of sertraline I feel really not depressed so I don't I don't think it's that. Oh. Are you doing here sorry. Animal made a big noise. You."
383.0,Provider,"So we have another appointment scheduled on the 21st and so can we just say that, between now and then I you know it's Monday so oh oh I. See you have a very. That you would not want the cat to walk around with."

383.0,Provider,So you have insurance you just even if it's is it. Whatever insurance that you have you know there's. providers that that are listed that. can reach out to to make an appointment.
12468.0,Patient,"They have anthem blue cross Blue Shield and I have a card in my wallet it's very, very easy there's a number right on the card. To call and get a primary care provider. i'll do that. I will do that."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and what you want to do with your calendar is you just. put it on your calendar, and you can even do it after you get off of this call, I mean."
12468.0,Patient,Girls they never will.
383.0,Provider,What with that.
12468.0,Patient,that's what i'm thinking or saying every will.
383.0,Provider,yeah the way to do to deal with procrastination it's a wonderful and simple statement and i'll tell you what it is it's a it's very it's very effective. Just to simply do it now.
12468.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah so that means if you can do it now do it now, you can make that phone call do it now, you know."
12468.0,Patient,"Definitely lots of my sister says. bro just do it right now, or you're never gonna do it like Okay, I know i'll do it later, but I will I will call him after this phone call."
383.0,Provider,"yeah good. And how are you doing with regards to. You know, getting some things. accomplished delayed gratification not doing your video games till later in the day and and that. kind of. thing that's."
12468.0,Patient,"kind of going a little I do with my time. My productive yeah that's been improving little bit on like clean my room background wake up and have coffee or pop in the bathtub or take a shower. And then i'll like I don't split it up to where i'm like doing the stuff I need to do, and then doing the fun stuff i'll do like a little bit of productive stuff a little bit of fun stuff and i'll just keep going back and forth that way. To kind of ease into it, but. I don't know."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
12468.0,Patient,Does that count.
383.0,Provider,"At least there's pretend productive stuff getting done that's good. I would still work with yourself to kind of imagine that imagine yourself. Having the fun part be. Towards the end of the day, or you know after three o'clock in the afternoon or something like that, like think about. Traditional school hours you know you went to school, maybe even if you're homeschooled I don't know but probably but you know you did school tell three and then the bell rang and. I have to go home and have some freedom, but you know, so that you can get concentrated amount of time doing productive activity, because if you split and start go to going toward. Just enjoyable activities and then it loses I think it loses momentum in terms of getting the productive stuff you know off the ground."
12468.0,Patient,it's kind of hard to pull away from those things. that's true.
383.0,Provider,and going back to the things you need to do.
12468.0,Patient,yeah like that three o'clock sounds like a good time it'll be like a school day.
383.0,Provider,And you. can think of. yeah I have a bell here.
12468.0,Patient,what's that boy.
383.0,Provider,"Well, I used to use it initially for some thoughts that I was thinking too much, and I was thinking well if I bring the bell every time that I think that thought it will remind me how much i'm thinking it and redirect to a more positive thought."
12468.0,Patient,"But it can let me use to mark time like in between clients, or you know kind of a fresh page opening up a."
383.0,Provider,Fresh session of you know refreshing my own mental state.
12468.0,Patient,interesting. You don't think that if you're like stuck on a bad thought and you ring the bell it'll kind of start to like associate bell ringing with bad thoughts or something.
383.0,Provider,"No, because I didn't really I never really was very successful at ringing the bell every time I thought that negative thought so."
12468.0,Patient,And I think that listen to.
383.0,Provider,The sound of the bell is a really nice sound so. yeah but.
12468.0,Patient,I mean very pretty.
383.0,Provider,And the thing about sort of bracketing our. Time or you know. identifying certain times when you're going to do certain things is a way of structuring your day so. see if we can work to get you a little bit more. Space in between the activities that are recreational and productive activities if we can increase those timeframes.
12468.0,Patient,You see what i'm saying.
383.0,Provider,"There and think of it as creation, you know when you're on the video game that's recreation."
12468.0,Patient,Oh yeah absolutely.
383.0,Provider,yeah. So it doesn't mean that you can't be creative during your productive time. But I think you know when you're engaging in something that's just purely for recreation and sometimes out of avoidance of doing the things that just need to get done.
12468.0,Patient,yeah to be creative during those times two. Is that what you're saying.
383.0,Provider,"What I was saying was that. We want, if you could have more concentrated time doing the productive things, but I was saying that creativity can also be like you were drawing that can be in your productive timeframe. as well, because I know that that was helping you feel like you were doing something, and that it was enjoyable and."
12468.0,Patient,It yeah. should get back into that my brain is just so hyper I just change habits and activities. Change hobbies often. Are you.
383.0,Provider,"i'm connecting with like friends are you still like on that dating site, or how is we're gonna have to end soon, because our appointments only 30 minutes and I am expecting someone here any moment but."
12468.0,Patient,"Oh it's going well i'm not really in the dating APP anymore medical people who just kind of weren't very nice, and so it was kind of daunting, but I am talking to this nice guy from corning named Caesar and he seems really sweet and calm and polite and intelligent so. it's nice to have him around We talked on the phone and facetime and play video games together, sometimes, which is really nice and. I talk with my friends from school, sometimes we kind of ask each other about our progress with the phlebotomy train school. that's really nice to kind of like gauge, where I should be based on where everyone else's. which can also be kind of dangerous but. yeah I feel pretty social."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good, well, and you haven't had you been maintaining your sobriety so that is what you know that's number one."
12468.0,Patient,The big one.
383.0,Provider,yeah really great.
12468.0,Patient,Thank you.
383.0,Provider,yeah.
12468.0,Patient,I think late November it'll be a year.
383.0,Provider,that's awesome. yeah so let's just review you're going to and you may want to write this down. endeavor and finding an na group. Getting a primary care doctor.
12468.0,Patient,"You are in it, you only pencils yes."
383.0,Provider,"So just shut this down and. Getting your primary care doctor finding an na group to join us online and seeing if you can structure your time a little bit more leaning in the productive direction with 3pm after 3pm is when you're going to go into recreation to going to try to. withhold gratification for your you know wanting to enjoy instant enjoyment. push the put that off. yeah. Good and keep up with what you're doing all the things. you're doing keep that up I think it's really great you're going to bed earlier and using that APP and then getting up earlier and and. You know, maintaining your medication to stay on that and so forth, I think it'd be really good for you to get into it, an na group. But something that's a little bit more supportive of your sobriety, then the bright heart health group, which I think is seems like it's not meeting all your needs."
12468.0,Patient,"Little lackluster sometimes seems a little casual, but I will go hunt one down. Okay, you for the recommendation."
383.0,Provider,"Sure, so i'll See you in our next appointment, you know when that is."
12468.0,Patient,yeah I have it written down. At my spot.
383.0,Provider,At noon.
12468.0,Patient,"I have it written down all over the place, so I don't forget this time."
383.0,Provider,Okay. i'm sorry no problem well you take care of yourself Chris glad you're doing well. Be to your body. Michelle okay.
12468.0,Patient,But remember.
