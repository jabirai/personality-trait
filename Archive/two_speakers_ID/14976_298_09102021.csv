14976.0,Patient,"Oh, a more park California."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, my name is chantel Escobar I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner so that means you can call me shinto. um so let me think you were just in the hospital and your insurance likes you to check in with a provider, like myself, to make sure that you have a mental health plan. after leaving the hospital and have somebody to do everything for you, you know with you, so my question to you is do you have a psychiatrist or a doctor to write your medicine."
14976.0,Patient,"um no I had a doctor at the hospital, I was at, but I think it was a temporary."
298.0,Provider,yeah and patient do you have a therapist.
14976.0,Patient,"No, I do."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, we have a program you are welcome to join it's a mental health program and what that means is, you see a therapist once every other week you go to group therapy once a week it's one hour long. And you have the opportunity to see me. Who prescribes medicines sorry who prescribes medicines, if you if a patient so chooses that's one option, you have is joining our program another option, you have. Is I can give you referrals that your insurance will pay for, and you can do something, maybe in person or you know that's not a full program and it's up to you what you would like to do, do you know what you would like to do."
14976.0,Patient,"um I kind of have an idea. I feel like. To be honest, I feel like after like the discharge and after you know my doctor told me like oh what's going on and stuff like that I feel pretty good. I guess I I feel like good I have my future like planned out, I want to get associates degree, maybe design clothes, or something like that some cool."
298.0,Provider,yeah that is. So you're not sure you even really want to seek mental health care.
14976.0,Patient,"Right, because I feel pretty like all right, but the only thing is that I do have a diagnose depression from. My doctor and I do take medicine at the moment from is a temporary prescription. And I want to continue on that. Because that does come on but. yeah as far as mental health help I feel pretty all right."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. So, would you like me to give you a referral for a psychiatrist only that can prescribe those meds or would you like to just go back to your family doctor."
14976.0,Patient,"Oh, I have to think about that, but so I can go for my family doctor or a psychiatry is that you would recommend."
298.0,Provider,"Correct and. I don't know whether your family doctor will prescribe those meds for you. A lot of family doctors do do mental health because there's a shortage. of mental health providers and so family doctors just have to. And so that's one option, I think if that's the road you take it wouldn't hurt to at least take some ideas from me and to get an email of numbers that you can call that are within your network. On psychiatrists."
