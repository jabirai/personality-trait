What what area in my life I need to improve on or what a part of my life to me to analyze. And I got I think I just start overthinking so much. And up like not knowing what I need to talk about or what need. like this dust um. yeah that's like i'm my stand right now but. Like How are they supposed to go like i'm supposed to say like how i'm feeling like i'm or is it just anything I want to talk."
527.0,Provider,Just anything. yeah just anything yeah yeah.
11683.0,Patient,Oh okay so. Before like so i'm always like that friend right or just that person who always reaches out like oh hey how are you doing i'm going to just check up on.
527.0,Provider,You know.
11683.0,Patient,"And then. I know that as soon as I just stopped doing that only a few people will like i'm actually close to will check up on me. right away Okay, and before like before where i'm at right now I would be like oh my God like I would start overthinking i'd be like oh wow why aren't they talking back like they do something wrong. I was over analyzing things and I think I just tried so hard to I guess get their approval or like feel that I was worthy of their time but like right now, for instance, right i'm. Like these past two weeks or about yeah. I started talking to one of my friends, who I had a chemistry with. And then, what is it I would shoot a text me in the morning, or I will admit oh hey i'm going to study right now let's study together okay. I think i'm. Thursday or Friday she just stopped she just she just stopped. Being back. And then. I was like Okay, I was like okay I just I just first off, I was like if she wants to talk, so let me know but I don't I don't need. To pay for her attention. feel. needed. um and yeah and honestly that and then also my best friend right. Before literally talk every single day. Okay, and, for some reason I don't. Think i'm we know why she stopped talking to me, but what is it. Even so, before like if things were to get like really bad in my life for her life, like we would all. these past two or three weeks or maybe even this past month. I started noticing that she started, I guess, like in a week distancing yourself from me. Okay um and then like first started off like. Oh, why isn't she returning my calls. Or why isn't she like making an effort to call me back or anything and like. I would have silver stress out to be like oh what am I doing wrong this in that. Okay, and like last week, I was like you know or I think it was yesterday. I know the beginning of this week I called it right. I was a key whatever you call me like what's wrong and then surely have no comment right and I was like Okay, and then. She just said it very like. In a very like careless tone right like she wasn't into the conversation."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11683.0,Patient,"and honestly I didn't feel offended I was like Okay, like in a way, like her tone was just a little bit it took it off as rude. And then want to have this conversation with her, it seems like she's really not in the conversation is always at the straggler she's thinking of something else. Sure, and it seems like she doesn't want to talk to me and then i'm like yeah sometimes like I do think like oh what what happened, they did I do something wrong. But then I was like you know, I was it just stop I wasn't you need to stop I was like he wants to talk to you she's going to talk to. Ever not okay. I was like it's okay. Okay, and I was like 10 hours a day, you still love her. And she's still gonna love you, but I was just overthinking and then yeah so I just stopped I just stopped, I think it was I was about to call her I think yesterday. And then I was like no you just need to stop like. begging people for their attention, or like for them to want to talk to you. If they want to talk to you they're going to talk to you, I was like did it show the effort and if they can talk to the literally I tell you oh hey i'm busy or you know they just even like a small little tax or something."
527.0,Provider,Sure sure.
11683.0,Patient,"And I guess in a way, I just really matured on that and before I wouldn't be able to do that, like, I will. I will, I mean, I still have you know ways to go and improve. But I think before like. I will just care so much about like what people would think. What do yeah we'll do it, I honestly like. Like before like um. I would just care just yeah just care everything, maybe I would feel like I wouldn't need to do something to. Others to feel approved by them so that. They should. Be my friend. And I think i'm just at a point where I just don't care i'm just like i'm. Like i'm grateful for my partner, and for my family. And i'm. Like Okay, it was like friends come and go, but if they want to be part of their life if of my life they're gonna make ELISE enough for to try. and reporting and life."
527.0,Provider,"i'm sorry, so are you feeling like these two friends are. Not trying at this point."
11683.0,Patient,"um yeah like the first one right the one I had come to you with. I don't know what she's going through like I know like before we talk about like mental health, I was it oh hey. Like are you doing and then that topic kind of minimum comfortable because she would get very people then she stopped for some time. Okay um. And like we go like a few days talking and then I don't know where she just vanishes right she just stops. yeah and then the other one. She I really I don't I wouldn't mind getting her like she's never done this before."
527.0,Provider,I was gonna say it sounds like you and that's your best friend right.
11683.0,Patient,My best friend. i'm.
527.0,Provider,Just sounds like you just needed to hear from her like. hey i'm i'm busy right now I can't talk in you know i'll get i'll call you later or something or can we can we catch up at another time. that's better.
11683.0,Patient,"yeah like. I mean I don't know what is it I wasn't like texting or every single day, every hour the guild hey call me back for me Bob. Lead share my song send off like I guess kind of like. This energy like Oh, we will get to the call like within two or three days and we're just like Okay, you know. But yeah. She just stopped. And I don't know if it's because she just so she's pregnant right now with her third child. Okay, and it was an unexpected pregnancy and I know she's going to alarm. Okay, so I don't know if it stopped, but I feel like I should just stop overthinking. And just let it be. Like i'm literally thinking about her. Well yeah it's hard to like not want to, I mean to not like call her. Sure yeah."
527.0,Provider,I was gonna say because it sounds like you're kind of struggling with that a little bit.
11683.0,Patient,Late yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. I want to be able to to not overthink and let this go, but at the same time, this isn't this isn't unusual behavior from her and so. But at the same time, you know she's pregnant and so is she having some emotional issues you know related to that going on that's maybe playing into but has she has she been able to be open and honest with you, before."
11683.0,Patient,yeah she has.
527.0,Provider,"And that's why it's probably difficult, then, because this is. Definitely, a change in her behavior."
11683.0,Patient,"yeah and it's just I don't know it's just weird to me I don't know if she just doesn't want to talk, because I know it's only I guess i'm her fiance and then I think her sister in law at. The great if people know. That she's pregnant okay yeah or isn't being no."
527.0,Provider,i'm not sure she like newly pregnant like.
11683.0,Patient,yeah I think. She just told me like I think a bottom months.
527.0,Provider,ago okay okay.
11683.0,Patient,um but yeah I don't know it's just hard not to but it's just hard to I guess i'm. Not overseeing.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm, what do you, what do you think you need at this point, I mean Is there something you want to say to her to kind of put it back in her court in us."
11683.0,Patient,"um I just I think I I pretty much made a play with, like the other calls i'm like oh hey we're having a call me or doesn't that in at a point where i'm just like i'm not gonna like continue I just putting myself in a situation where I asked her oh hey, what can I do what's wrong. And then I just just her nah. I guess just valuing or appreciating that i'm doing that."
527.0,Provider,And yeah checking in with her.
11683.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm just like whatever she wants to talk she's gonna call me if she doesn't want to talk."
527.0,Provider,"But how do you want to address that, though, because it sounds like that that bothers you that just the lack of response from her when that's. Like, how do you want to kind of resolve this with her."
11683.0,Patient,"um I think you should call me i'm just gonna tell her that good rather just wait for her to call me. uh huh um and yeah and then just talk to her, but at the same time, like the other times, where she's called me, it seemed like she just want to call me just to call me, but like not really be in the conversation. So i'm just like i'm just going to pay attention to that too so she's actually in the conversation."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure yeah definitely definitely.
11683.0,Patient,"um and then, if she's not well then i'm just i'm. I think i'm just going to get her off the same energy she's giving me off i'd rather not continue just being so like mines and then her taking like gum. advantage of my kindness or."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, so, so what could you say to her though let's kind of walk through that because I think it's important that you be able to use your voice and express your thoughts and feelings to her reactions and behaviors that are impacting you."
11683.0,Patient,Like of our too short to call me right.
527.0,Provider,uh huh.
11683.0,Patient,"and And what is it, she was a So this was just something that she called me right. And then is like already talking to somebody else like to her fiance or somebody else. And then she gets distracted with something else. And it practically goes on for it, I don't know how long. Okay um so if it were in that. position i'd be like oh. I don't think I would really talk to her, because I mean, first of all, she wouldn't not like interested in. Talking i'm like oh just call me back one once you're not busy."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think it's and I think it's okay to say to her, you know it sounds like it sounds like you're really busy so maybe we need to talk at a different time."
11683.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,"Because I think it's pointing out, first of all, you want to point out the behavior that's not okay with you, I know, yes. So you know if you feel like she's not present with a conversation or distracted you know point you can point that out that's a specific behavior that she's showing so. You know it's you know it sounds it sounds like you're really busy and there's other things going on how about, we have a have a conversation at a later time that when you're not so busy."
11683.0,Patient,um. that's a nice way to go about it.
527.0,Provider,"Well it's it's just it's being assertive with how you're feeling, you know in recognizing that that there's something going on that you're not just going to be like. Oh okay well i'm just going to try to be in the conversation as best as I can, with her, even though she's not really in the conversation like that's just going to frustrate you more, I think."
11683.0,Patient,um yeah that's true.
527.0,Provider,Because you're not going to want to talk about anything because you're not feeling like she's even listening to you.
11683.0,Patient,yeah i'm. Opening I alright i'll do. But if she is in the conversation um.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, how do you want to approach that with her like how you've been feeling with recent conversations with her."
11683.0,Patient,um I mean we say rick oh hey i'm. Like is there is there something wrong like. Is there something that you need to talk about. Okay.
527.0,Provider,"But before that let's. let's BAT let's back up a little bit because let's look at it, because that's that I want you to put that in there, but let's back up to what is the behavior that you've noticed over the last couple phone calls with her."
11683.0,Patient,she's not like. she's right instructors and she doesn't want to talk.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe maybe saying hey there's been something i've wanted to talk with you about i've noticed in the last couple phone calls that we've had you seem really. distracted and not really present for our conversation, and I was just wondering, you know, is there, something is something going on, like, then you can add that piece in there is there something going on is there. You know, it has there been something that i've said that's upset you i'm just trying to figure out, you know what's been different with our conversations recently. Because again is pointing out the behavior that's been bothering you with her."
11683.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
527.0,Provider,Because Maybe she hasn't even recognized it in us so maybe she doesn't realize how distracted she's been.
11683.0,Patient,open and want to write those own while i'm reading a dumb because I know my frequent leader um. yeah that's actually you know that's that's better. I think of my flow better um.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and the other The other thing is, you know, maybe, and maybe letting her know, since that is your best friend, you know it's been frustrating for me because I enjoy. Our calls together, and I want to, and I really do my best to you know or I I I pay attention to what you're you're sharing with me and i'm feeling frustrated that it's not that you're not really listening to me."
11683.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"or whatever, or whatever it may be, however, you want to say that if if you choose to just do that. Oh, you know own your feelings on how it's been for you. yeah mm hmm."
11683.0,Patient,"I think in the previous conversations i'm just like. I just I guess been I would I tell her all he, like out in a way, I would tell her like i'd be feeling. But I was on just like very aggressive will actually mean. And that just didn't end up going well."
527.0,Provider,And I share.
11683.0,Patient,"yeah, but this is just better um I noticed, I have a really hard time, just like. Knowing how to I guess. Talk about my feelings or just what's going on, or what's bothering me. In a way, that. That isn't aggressive and I know you gave us that little, I think, maybe a month ago we were talking about this in group, like what's a way that we can get our point across without being like without I guess what was it."
527.0,Provider,Physical oh so it's so passive aggressive and assertive when we talked about communication. yeah yeah yeah yes.
11683.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so. So passive is just you know kind of letting people walk all over you and not really speaking up for yourself and then aggressive is just you know reacting and not you know being impulsive and just kind of blurting things out and not really. Looking at what consequences may come from that Okay, and then assertiveness is you know owning your thoughts and feelings on something and identifying the behavior or situation that. You are reacting to. So, for example, when we use assertiveness. And, as is when we use the I feel statements."
11683.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11683.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
527.0,Provider,"You know I feel I feel. But we'll just we'll just give an example of the conversation, you know I you know I feel frustrated when you call me and you're. distracted by others in the background or having conversations in the background, and I, you know, I feel that i'm not as important, you know for during this phone call and and you know, maybe we need to. not talk, or maybe we need to talk at times when you're not as busy."
11683.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay i'll wait for her call or not no i'll just like kind of like brush that thought off, you know, because then it's just gonna like make me overthink."
527.0,Provider,This in that okay yeah.
11683.0,Patient,"I mean. You should just have this little cool little paper. right here, this was cool um yeah I think. That was one of the things that's been bothering me and then another. What is it oh oh sorry I was looking at something else um oh yeah so i've been thinking a lot about like this other friend rate i'm like I when it comes to friendship like I really take them like serious."
527.0,Provider,You know sure yeah yeah. I hear ya.
11683.0,Patient,"What is it i'm. Like with her, like her name is Maggie right. um she and I met at work and her and Malik we just clicked we just started talking and just. Everything went well, and then we got to a point where we start. inviting each other to like family gatherings. Okay, but then. What is it, I felt like. I just um. I guess the love I have for the love the love that I had for the friendship and for her I guess i'm getting the with me actually kind of realizing that some of the things that the little things that she would do. Okay i'm like, for instance, like. I think. Well, I think this was actually be one so um. We went to like a family gathering um. I would think. It was her side so her sister was there and then. It was and then somebody from him, and then there were some friends there as well, and then. It was me and then. I think, to my close friends. Okay, my brother and then. One of his close friends."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11683.0,Patient,"And then anyway, some one of them left, and it was just four of us right, so my brother and my other two and then was it his friend and then my friend and then me. Okay, and then people were just started, I guess, leaving and then. I don't know what happened everyone was just a cauldron minute left her purse on the table. But I know my friend, like he's come all over all the time he's my brothers. my brother, no, you know where the time and there's always stuff everywhere right. And then. The his my brother's friend he knows how she is and she's known for so many years and she's never done anything wrong um so anyway so maggie's personal there and I really don't know what happened, I mean there were there were some people. And then I think I think we leave. yeah we leave so does happen, and I think her purse disappeared or I don't know what happened exactly. Okay we're I think I was a wallet that was in the present disappeared. And so that's going on, and I think there were barely noticing when we were already on our way to. To my other friends house. So, like i'm already pulling up to my friends driveway like after finishing the party and then, then I get a call from he was like hey you know hey what is it um. Did you happen to see my wallet like did you happen to see my wallet or the canoe my friends and if it's it's just disappeared and I don't know what happened, I don't have anyone stole it. i'm not blaming you I just, I just wanted to know like like I trust you, but I know I don't know the other girl that your brother brought. Sure, and then I don't trust from the, can you please ask them i'm just gonna treasure. The girl and literally have like a little teddy bear person she she didn't have anything in it, I think she just had like. Her phone. I don't remember i'm mostly know I asked him. And then. I think. She was it oh like oh i'm just it's just weird a mess because i've always invited and same people over and over again."
527.0,Provider,and send them to share.
11683.0,Patient,"his friend comes over and then out of nowhere my wallet disappears right and then. She was like. Oh no oh. I was like no like like we trust them with a date they've never done anything wrong. and So I was like you know I took it, let me just go there and I was like i'll bring them with me, you can talk to them, if you want and. I was like yeah I was like so you can like I just feel a shirt okay so then we head over to her house like it was like the four of us, and then her sisters already standing in front of her like. In front of the driveway like already like she was like crossed arms and she's like. Looking at mad. she's just giving us the evil eye, you know, like she's all angry and then my items out into the canaan's like my wallet it's gone like I don't know we look for it everywhere we can find it and it's always the same people we invited, this has never happened and then. We have before I before we went there, I told him, you know we can go with her and you to look through our purposes, if you don't like you can look through the part like hey. i'm not going to look through your purse I trust you right. And then, when I get there, so like Mike is already there by the window and then she's like oh i'm was a key yeah you can look at all of a person."
527.0,Provider,yeah sure.
11683.0,Patient,"But then what is it I think she checks mind first and she like really goes into it and I think in my in my head, I was like if she trusts me then why she doing this, she said that she wasn't going to go through it. And then. decided to ignore the other people, I think it was one of the girls are my brother pushes didn't even bother looking at their parents, but it really seemed like she was looking more into my than their noses. And then i'm. A what is it her sister and Maggie just just there were just so angry well you know they lost her wallet but. Sure in like they were just blaming us that we stole them. And then. So. days go by and then Emily and then being so that's what I call him my brother mom. My mom was. Like you know us who's like you know what we wouldn't ever do anything wrong. And then. Emily was like yeah how's it that's weird and then Emily like all of us were saying Oh, I think it was maybe one of her family relatives, maybe they knew that because we were like new. Day might have just taken advantage of idea and they might have like taking it so, then it would seem like it was us and then do what him suspect anyone from. There right. So, then, I I feel really bad right, even though I didn't do like anything wrong. I just felt bad that she lost her wallet and that. As soon as she was being Nice. And then we we think we went back to Carmen is I was working with her at this time. And then she was like he knows what's wrong. Oh, nothing like know what's wrong this because I. Like I think I just it was just for me to talk about it, like I just really didn't want to talk about it. Right okay sure. And then I wasn't I was just i'm like you know, as I know you all it there's something wrong and your tongue. And then not okay right so she kind of got mad and then. I think if we dispel by. And then I told her I came I. Remember that day that you told me there was something wrong with it yeah well yeah I did lie to you were right."
527.0,Provider,"eventually comes out, you know."
11683.0,Patient,"I I told him that came out was just that honestly like i'm. Like honestly for power you lost your wallet. Did you find your wallet i'm like I was just like did you find a signal I didn't find it. shows again on, but I just activated everything and it was all. Anything else important and then the owner I just ordered another copy of my. My thing, but I was, I think she's like a very, very, very prideful person like. If she does something wrong. it's very hard for her to I guess recognize her mistake. Okay um. And I think I think. She. I think she knew it wasn't me or my friends, but like she didn't say like oh hey i'm sorry like if it came off wrong I was just I was just concerned for my wallet like."
527.0,Provider,Cheese sure.
11683.0,Patient,"She she just brushed it off. She wasn't I know it's okay just work don't work. don't worry about it, if my sister thought something wrong she wouldn't want you to come over to my house anymore. And then. What is that was that that's kind of weird, though, because they hold grudges they really do hold grudges. Okay um and then i'll let that's weird I was like because if. There was something off that didn't make it seem like it was us that took it. They would brush it off and then make it I guess seemed like nothing happened. But if they were. When they get like a bottling somebody or they think that somebody does something to them or whatever, no um anyway. They literally have wouldn't they don't want to they just want to talk to them. So just what what happened that made them made. them I guess just brush it off, I was like something may have happened and then they're like Oh, maybe, maybe they found out what was or anything. But anyways my friends were like you know honestly honestly you shouldn't go back that was it don't go back to her like them. It was already wrong for her like she was kind of insinuating that I was you just added that she trusts you and that. She wasn't going to go through your prayers but then she's the one she come by the window and then she goes more theater person at anybody else like she did go really deep into my purse."
527.0,Provider,And more than.
11683.0,Patient,any of them and that's not that's not right in as a.
527.0,Provider,sure.
11683.0,Patient,"A friend should have been doing that, like it was Okay, for her to go through the other through the other girl because she was no but she didn't. And I was like religion Okay, and then i'm. done, I think there's no by again and then she was like oh I started listening to myself from her right. Because I work, for I work with her. Why you. amen yeah I brought it up again, I was at almost I don't remember to a family gathering Oh, I told her She invited me to another one oh it's just I don't want the same thing to happen and. then disappear, and then you guys are gonna think it was me."
527.0,Provider,On their friends.
11683.0,Patient,"And then she was like, no, no, no, no um. I think I honestly do think that she she and her sister. know that it wasn't us like I just know um but they just don't want to make us say anything. But anyways so I was just getting that feeling and like when I brought it up with oh yeah it was too much he didn't really want to talk about like what happened last time, like she didn't want to recognize what I feel."
527.0,Provider,uncomfortable sure.
11683.0,Patient,"um but anyways I go back right and then my friend live on, as soon as you should have been talking to her anymore like that's not right. And then sort of the one that I was mentioning like in the conversation. What is it oh yeah so I go to I think her I think months, but why, after what happened and then then she has a party right."

I think yeah I wasn't about they offered to come with me, but I wasn't no no it's okay it's Okay, because I was I wasn't aware of what was going on. And then so go to the bathroom and myself. And then. What is it oh yeah and then yeah and then I finished up doing what I needed to do. And then I washed my hands and then. I just sat on the toilet but was my clothes on like I didn't do anything, because I think everything was just spending too much, and I was like I need to sit down and take a."
527.0,Provider,break okay.
11683.0,Patient,"Because I know if I was gonna go out there, they were going to charge charge take more shots and I was like no I don't want to um. So I was just sitting there. And then I just passed out and live is that I just completely passed out, and when I passed out really there was an earthquake here by where we're at. And then I didn't feel it. I was so knocked out, I did not feel it and I don't know for how I don't know how long I was there for because then.

I think he got there earlier than what he was supposed to and. He is not like the type of person he's like a very shy person like he's really, really shy, but he was really worried, so he came and knocked on the door and then he was a key I came here for another she okay like it's not picking up the phone like."

11683.0,Patient,"Linda were like the governor she's not passed out right and then. Then they were hospitals like knows like honestly it really hurt me how they were treating me they were like they didn't even want to like help you out of the bathroom because they were just on. The stuff that was the idea that you're just sitting on there and they didn't even like Father helping me out all they wanted to do was just use a restroom and they're like oh just got her out I need to use the restroom just get her out. Like a she's. What is it. Because of her I can go to the bathroom and then didn't even bother asking it's like if I was okay to didn't want oh i'm like are you good or this and that. But. Like when they come to the bathroom Mike it was like. She wasn't going to complete different person when she was with me. Because he they were they were all drunk, but they were seeing all these things like Oh, there were seeing all these buzzwords but. Then into I guess helped me is she will like a completely different person like oh here you goodness, and that this and that. But then immediately she went to use the restroom afterwards and then. asked her like he was just helping me out and then he was a he was your phone look why don't I left it on the table, I was like Okay, let me just. Let me just walk into the car and then, but as he was walking to the car he noticed that one of the girls had my phone. So then, he was like I think I don't think no I don't think it was Maggie that went to the bathroom I think it was another girl. But anyway, i'm Maggie know he was, but he said it and Michael sarcastic way you know, he was like oh um he may I think that's my girls phone and there's, no, no, no that's her phone, but she knew it was my phone. And there's a normal she has an identical phone. And then. yeah he, like when he when he came in, he noticed like how they were acting I thought they were. Being um. And then, what does it he walks me to the car he, like puts my sleep alone is it okay just wait here okay. i'll be free and it's like English you sure you left it runs again. So then he goes back and he knocks. And then they didn't even say anything man, he was like here and then we'll shut the door."
527.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11683.0,Patient,"And then. What is it that the next day he didn't want to tell me what happened because he knew how much they and alternatives in that. And that's why I remember, I told you that I want to eat tacos with with a friend afternoon right."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11683.0,Patient,"He never told me why he got really mad, it was because I went to go eat tacos with her. Okay, at that time, when I went to go eat with her. Like she. Actually guess there was going something on with the family, and she didn't have anyone to lean on. And I told her what she was going through and this and that. And then I think it just made, Oscar upset because I think he was like remembering that night. sure. He was like Oh, she showing causing this when she needs her like that's not right. And then I think that happened but it went off I don't know for how many months, he never told me and then went to go eat chocolate with her yeah he got mad, I want to go back like his whole like sexes like. Controlling thing was one thing, but the other one was. The idea of me going with her."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, because he felt like she disrespected you."
11683.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,And him okay.
11683.0,Patient,"And then, what is it um and then she was just she called me up and was like oh hey yeah we can go, we can go. So we went to go eat and then. yeah she told me ya know like i'm not talking to my sister i'm not talking to anybody, but i'm literally here by myself. and other Oh, you know, I was just talking to her, and this and that and then I told Oscar that and then I think he just got it. Is a young man. He didn't say anything he will the goal came. And I think another I don't know another few months came back I don't think I think it wasn't on May or June of this year, he died, he told me what happened so again, as I mentioned to talk to you about something so again it's just i'm like. Look, I know how much you love Maggie and this and that and it's just I don't want you to think that I don't want you hanging out with the girls or anything it's just I specifically would prefer that you would just stay away from her. Because she's like going to confront you like, she calls you when she only needs you."
527.0,Provider,know me.
11683.0,Patient,"Oh, what and then he told me what happened that night and then. It was like that's not what a good friend supposed to do it was like a good friend would have like helped me out even if you said it wasn't wasn't necessary. She wouldn't. be discussing you and she wouldn't. have been so for vogue or with her words because he was he said that she was seeing some stuff when I was like in the bathroom So this was before. The that's not what a good friend posted during this I was like. What would have happened if I wasn't there like if I didn't pick you up. And I was like look, he was it's up to you, if you want to be talking to her or not. But then I was honestly I was like you just need to stop, and I was like I know you're very kind person, it was talking to myself. And I was like but you need to just stop. Is a filling yourself with people who just take you for granted and they really don't. So then. I was like should I let confront her about this should I not but then. I was like i've already tried confronting her about the wallet and stuff."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11683.0,Patient,"And then those a It confronts her about this she's just gonna like. This is not gonna wanna like accept anything she did wrong and she and I was like you know i'm like i'm not gonna waste my time trying to like. Get her to I guess apologize, or like for her to recognize that she did something wrong. And i've already promised myself in a position, like that for like twice and I was like and if it was something as simple as that. or she just brushed it off, and she didn't want to talk about it anymore. Nothing chances of her wanting to talk about this and then her recognizing that she what she did was wrong and so then afterwards I just stopped like I have never done this i'm. To a friend. Like I stopped. I stopped answering the tux. And yeah I just stopped answering your talks and. I think I know um. She got her sister to tax me to see if there was something wrong. Okay, I didn't I didn't respond, either because I was just like i'd rather just not I was like cuz they're gonna make me feel bad about what happened that they make it was my fault and this and that and I was i'd rather not go through all that."
527.0,Provider,"So what do you learn in about your friendships here recently, you know."
11683.0,Patient,"i'm that i'm i'm to giving and i'm too forgiving and. Ah, I just let myself even blocked over you know. Like I don't respect myself, I feel like. I would give off like more energy that all that they're like on a higher pedestal than me and that they're more important. I think imma just at this point where i'm like if they don't want to talk to me it's okay like i'm not gonna beg them MCI would before and. If they're like not going to be giving me. I guess good vibes are just being a good friend, I was like Why am I going to be wasting my time. With people that are not going to be respectful me appreciative of me or all of that. mm hmm and yeah so i've been just honest i've been really thinking about her like I really do even though she what she did was wrong. I don't want sure I don't want anything bad."
527.0,Provider,You know sure sure.
11683.0,Patient,"Like I love her from afar, like, I really want the best for her like i've told her many times, I was like. Oh, like, I know you and I don't know each other very well, but I honestly wish you the best of luck in such a strong woman and. you've been through it all, and I know you didn't want you know just going to confront."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11683.0,Patient,"But yeah and I do think about it, and I think it's just hard like. To. Just to. get around the idea that, even though she was a good friend, I guess, for me, for quite some time. I think I I. I ignored some of like the little hints like in the beginning of the friendship that I should have like used us red flags, you know."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11683.0,Patient,Oh yeah I think it's just hard I think i'm.
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah I think it's hard when you're trying to work on personal things with yourself and and you know find your value and worth and be able to set boundaries with others that aren't respectful of that. In and not a healthy relationship for for you, you know and it's not a healthy relationship for them either. But it is hard drawn those lines, especially when it's been friends that you've known for a while and. But, but you have to take care of yourself, too, and if it's not something that's going to help your. Energy and self esteem and value then it, it does require having to look at that, like is this someone that I need in my life at this point is this going to be a helpful friend, or is this going to be more damaging to how I feel about myself."
11683.0,Patient,"And no, I think, also, I think I just cut off a lot of people that were i'm not not good to me like even my cousin has been they brought her up on like one of the group things like. that she did so rock she does so many things to me like um well, I was just too forgiving in the beginning, but then I think eventually got to the point where I was just like i'm done. So her to I cut her off. Because I was like she hasn't changed is going to continue like this. And i've told her many times. And I was like i'm just done, like. yeah so I just. I don't like I don't I don't want your anything body know. For sure I think I for her I forgiven her. But I think i'm just like what he saw that because of her have to cut her off."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah it is it's great it's grieving that loss of a friendship and a relationship that. That you've had.
11683.0,Patient,yeah so and then that's one of the things I think i've been just focusing on. I think i've been just yeah been grieving about like friendships.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah i'm sorry you're having to do that, you know but but i'm proud of you for recognizing that you're worth more and a friendship, then then just being there when when it's convenient or when it's. You know, on their terms and not a mutual friendship back and forth."
11683.0,Patient,"yeah normally I don't feel bad and honestly i'm really grateful that I was able to do that, because if I didn't like imagine how would still be like I would still like be trusting of them and."
