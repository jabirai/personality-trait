12330.0,Patient,"or no, I mean I know i'm going to get my money back. You know when it's just the. The inconvenience of everything. All right now. it's just them. or not, and then on top of that, I have my word next month. And I think you told me to contact them sometime around this time shadow. But if she told me to contact summer, this time of the month, and he was to settle a while he sounded like you never heard from him, but I don't know if I should follow up with him i'm having that anxiety like. yeah."

12330.0,Patient,yeah my attorney for my my face.
226.0,Provider,Well yeah you need to follow up with them not yeah. yeah.
12330.0,Patient,"Why would she said everything. I know it's just exciting. it's just my just my anxiety. yeah I hate I hate like he was he wants me to know my feet like. it's like what but he said he sounded very positive about it when we last spoke from the last birthday. yeah which is, which is nice it's just. i've just been other than that i've been feeling a lot better. it's just the. That whole thing that kind of backtrack me. And now. I feel like an idiot but, even though my parents think I might immediate you know because it's not it was just an inconvenience basic rules guys a terrible job. and yeah i'm just doing that. School is getting harder. yeah so that's a. I want to say harder, I mean it's just it's it. it's getting to the point where you can't even use a calculator. yeah i'm over here like wait there's math were no calculating. yeah. I. yeah cuz maybe well my teacher, I guess. The kids the students that know, I guess, they have like teacher reviews this teacher was like one of the hardest and i'm over here like ah. No wonder, because I remember, I was telling you in the beginning, that she was teaching it in a way that I didn't learn over the summer. I had to like relearn everything. Like. Like right and I ended up picking a face yeah it's just like that, but i'm glad just about everything in my life, right now, other than that, but I know i'm getting it back because they were to get an approval, but it's just a whole eating game."
226.0,Provider,"Well, you know Okay, so you know, the way to look at something like that it's like okay well that's something that happened. it's it's it's solvable right there's."
12330.0,Patient,"Man, I mean i've had situations like that, before you know it's just it's just an annoyance, you know. Because, then you gotta do it they're being for like an hour and it's like."
226.0,Provider,The thinking on it is like at least you're getting your money back like it wasn't stolen.
12330.0,Patient,Some so.
226.0,Provider,that's that's where you change the narrative.
12330.0,Patient,"yeah. Changing and i'm just. yeah and, like my relationships been really good with my wife, which has been happy. You know. she's in the same route with me steam like so we're like I was just she started and you should learn to kind of realize kinda like me, you know. I don't know, maybe she's just late bloomer but. You know everyone or everyone reacts differently to their own recovery. and Another we had like the Wednesday group meeting as an interesting meeting. You know, like what we want to improve."
226.0,Provider,And nice what you want to work on to. make improvements.
12330.0,Patient,"yeah I mean that's that's a really hard question. Because I feel like i've been in the. The whole the whole sobriety part but, like the whole mental part. Is what I was just trying to reach and I just covered a better person every day, you know. To keep becoming a better person every day and like like things, let me down. Right yeah."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
12330.0,Patient,"cuz i'm kind of one. or no, I guess i'm so and realize i'm very sensitive and they feelings, you know. I get my feelings or."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
12330.0,Patient,"So it's like when I do like all these good things, and then I see this negative thing happen it's like. it's like thank you. yeah you. know."
226.0,Provider,What do you mean like what he means by that but.
12330.0,Patient,"Just like just like like the whole situation like that whole like the guy just messing up so bad, and like taking so long. I know he was legitimate you send me the papers, because there's just like he kept messing up or no and I just got kind of like see it could be, you know, and this was like on October 3 and I was supposed to get it in two days from October 3. was like are you and I gave him, like the chance, like the benefit of the doubt you know. And I was just at the point where i'm just like it's not like, if I knew this is going to cause me this much headache I would have never done."
226.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think you need to ask yourself. Like when situations like this arise in your life. Why is it difficult to move past it where it's like okay just happened it's getting taken care of and I don't have to keep it I don't have to keep her separating like I don't have to have that I have to constantly be thinking about this like what do you think that's about."
12330.0,Patient,"very interesting that you say that. I don't know I mean. I mean like I don't know. I when I was younger. I felt like I was like. I was going through something like some serious depression. I can't really explain it's like a no feeling depression it's like where it's not where you like you don't want to hurt like you don't like you are happy about your life but he's like you're not. But you're still sad. you're happy, but. You feel you're like a happy emotionless person. No, no, I wouldn't say emotion was but. I would say, like just kind of happy, but still sad, you know. I don't know and then I just remember when I was younger. I mean my parents would come to the like they would drop me off to the appointments, but obviously I would be the only one talking. I just kind of remember back in the day. You know i'm not an 88 you know, like they were trying all these different types of antidepressants you are, you probably never even heard of yeah. Like stuff that's not even been sold yet or like they felt like I was like a guinea pig when I was younger. You know, like I would try, I will literally anti depressant for like two three weeks, and then they were there, how did you feel like I don't want this like. Terrible then they'll be like Well, this is from Switzerland was not even in the market try try it so here's the Pack for a month, they ever like an old. Member they send me like a little packet pop it out yeah I remember just tried so many different things, and I was just like what the heck man yeah and I just stopped."
226.0,Provider,"So I think that some of here's my here's my two cents, is, I think that you know when you start to really per separate over. Like, for instance, you know what happened, the delay, you know the guys, you know COs scandalous didn't go the way you want okay so that's perfectionism like you're looking at perfection doesn't exist in others for ourselves, like it does. So when you get really stuck on things have to go a certain way, like and lineup and like everything's. you're not really. you're going to be really disappointed."
12330.0,Patient,"yeah it's really, you said that I was like that yesterday."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
12330.0,Patient,I don't know.
226.0,Provider,"Some of that is just how your mind works, because, like you're really good at math like math is exact there's no you can't make mistakes with math okay. Some of that is just. Like you know that's just your brain like you're you're really smart like that okay. yeah but. It also there's also space that you can create flexibility. Where. Everything just can kind of flow and just kind of go and know that there's always a solution and that if I get stuck on this one thing that's how all my energy attention and focus goes, and then I missing everything else."
12330.0,Patient,"yeah you know what it really is is that i'm kind of like I kind of explained in the Wednesday meeting and a little bit of how I felt. You know it's like a like everything that i'm saying is kind of like what I said, you know i'm like i'm already doing doing what i'm doing i'm I continue doing what i'm doing, because I feel good about it yeah right, just like helping people and going out of my way and. But it's, just like the The biggest problem what i've noticed certain like the biggest program that i've noticed like personally. And when I said it before just all started relating I don't know why is I just had a feeling because i've been in that Wednesday group meeting every week. Instead of feeling because they they all we all feel the same way we're all we're all going to work or doing what we need to do we come home. we're all in our sobriety corps and nobody, you have to cut off your friends, you know so basically a lot of us in that group are really only talking to either or wives girlfriends and family. Okay well that's different from talking to like a really close friend. Right, you know and that's and that's. kind of what I don't have any more, you know I don't. I don't I don't have any like close friends or anyone to talk to, I mean I don't want to add stress to my parents live for stress to my life and. I don't feel like anybody deserves to feel any more energy what they already feeling in their own you know and then pretty much it's like To be honest, like i'm going to be straightforward you guys are like like the know you guys are like. You know my doctors and stuff but. I know, like you, guys are in a way, in a sense, like my friend, in a way."
226.0,Provider,Because I.
12330.0,Patient,"mean where do we express these types of feelings, you know. Right exactly feel. right if I in the party when I didn't have you guys like it, where I was and it's been the merge, you know I mean at first like. So it's like. that's just kind of where i'm at you know, I think it think it's just that that empty gap of like. i'm i'm happy. And then I got rid of those people, but I feel like. I don't know I just feel like it, because I know that my friends don't mean it unintentionally, they have their own things that they have to do to go friends wise but. You know just. You know I just don't. I don't know I just stay away from just anything that's. Just anything negative if you know. I don't want to you know i'm happy where i'm at but it's like the same time it's like I wish I could find like or maybe like another makeup or. Something or. Right somebody in the same boat."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. You know, so what it sounds like is that you need to. expand a little bit more, which is a good sign, meaning that you're ready that you feel solid enough to be able to do that, I think that's growth. And that's really healthy and that could be a goal that could be a focus, where you focus on like hey let's expand let's go meet some people let's go out to France go do this go get some food whatever you know yeah. yeah life gets kind of narrow like you know, like we're we're we're meant to be around other people right we're meant to have. human contact and interaction and when things get really narrow then that's where things just go oh my God, you know I got to expand I got to find somebody else to talk to you."
12330.0,Patient,"yeah I remember. One thing that probably affect and effect me so bad, remember, for a period of time. I just I remember when I was in high school I had this like crazy girlfriend. And like I remember I left her. because she was just saying you should remember, she was just like saying stuff like other people so nobody could talk to me it was almost like his childhood see you know, and I was like what the heck i'm leaving you yeah bye bye. yeah I remember waking up the next morning, and there was like a huge. Book you sign. on the side of my car. And I was driving that car with the huge Fuck you sign for like half a half a year."
226.0,Provider,wow oh.
12330.0,Patient,"So I suffer for half a year, I had to park my car outside my parents as what the Fuck you sign and it's like. You. Is me, remembering that, just like it was so petty yeah."
226.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean anybody that does that is really not. they're not very emotionally stable or balanced on that sure yeah."
12330.0,Patient,"But I think about it, you know I feel like life happens for a reason, because all I knows that she has like three kids she lost them, you know. she's on. she's just she's not here anymore, you know. Nothing like that, but like she's just on drugs and stuff the last time that I know. was her kids and I was like maybe that was just a blessing in disguise, but."
226.0,Provider,"You know and that's a great way of looking at it where it was god's way of protecting you and, like saying you know don't go any further with this person like we don't realize that how you know, like when something. doesn't work out a lot of times that's really an amazing blessing. But we look at it, as like we look at it, as like we're not good enough, we take it very personal we think we did something wrong, we we think about it, the we won't let it go it eats at us, it affects our our self esteem when, in reality, it was the best thing that could have happened."
12330.0,Patient,"yeah and I I just feel like that kind of caused a little bit more of my like. Maybe a depression or anxiety because of that, you know, just as I basically putting it on my forehead kind of you know, trying, because I have to yeah."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
12330.0,Patient,But um I don't know i'm just. I feel good I mean it's just i'm just feel i'm always everyone's going to always feel nervous when it comes to like court.
226.0,Provider,yeah totally. that's awful I agree. I just.
12330.0,Patient,I just happy that. New some sign that law is finally got thing.
