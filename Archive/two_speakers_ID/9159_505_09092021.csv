Even though rhymes two and a half cudi so that's where i'll put her this patient needs to be connected with case manager and she needs the primary care provider, I am not comfortable prescribing gabba penton for epilepsy. I prescribe it for psych, but I am not treating neurological condition and i'm not comfortable with that. dispute and also reported history of ptsd and Depression and anxiety just update her chart that she had a baby in July, she is still breastfeeding, and babies, about two months old now we are going to add her into our Tuesday at 130 group. And i'm going to have somebody a care manager or kids. Care navigator reach out and make sure she is up to date with her program requirements oh so it sounds like this patient has therapy outside of the heart and that that should be sufficient, although she. I don't know we'll check in with her about that okay thanks."
