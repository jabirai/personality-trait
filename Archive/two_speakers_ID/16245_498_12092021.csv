498.0,Provider,morning verify your name and date of birth coming.
16245.0,Patient,October 10 1988.
498.0,Provider,"Thank you so much for that, thank you for joining me this one, I just wanted to check in with me for a brief moment. and see how your medication was going, the last time that we've spoken group and you're experiencing some difficulty with regard to um what you describe is kind of like an emotional reaction so you feel still feel like you're feeling that way."
16245.0,Patient,"um yeah I still do they still have that problem on the medication, unfortunately I cannot take it on time like this is my love my problem is, and I was, I was gonna ask if it's okay to take it at night because i'm more active at night. I usually stay awake at night, and I feel like I do better at night, so I feel like I still wake up pretty early in the morning to go to work and do other things, and again less rest, but I was wondering, is it possible to take the same medication like and start over at night, maybe. have more control over taking it."
498.0,Provider,"Taking are you taking a while to your turn, are you taking the lexapro."
16245.0,Patient,"i'm taking the train, I believe the same same the very first one yeah but I stopped it. Because I was taking it and then I forgot about in the morning, so I, together again I try to really put a like constantly taking it because I also have to. give my dogs on medication you just gotta do a surgery so is complicated and then so it just bothers because a lot was going on my head, so I just i'll go to work or give forget about us I just stopped it again."
498.0,Provider,"So it doesn't have a sedative or a stimulant. effect with regard to activity so it's fine if you take it at night and it's tolerable for you at night. Some formulations of the medication. And you take twice a day or three times a day, so if you feel like you can be more compliant with it, if you take it at night that's fine."
16245.0,Patient,What time do you think is the best.
498.0,Provider,"What will the best time is going to be the time that you can make sure that you take it, so you tell me what you feel like is a good time for you to take it and be able to take it consistently."
16245.0,Patient,"Okay um. I mean, it could be during the afternoon. It was thinking to be like around like 4pm or something."
498.0,Provider,"that's fine that's fine you can start if you haven't taken it today, yes, take it today at 4pm and then see if you can continue to take it during that time. You see, because it's the consistency and I know the last time we talked it was kind of the same thing, and you would take it you weren't taking it so you still weren't necessarily. receiving any benefit from an index going to be whatever medication is going to be designed to help Have you had a chance to engage with your therapist individually, yet."

498.0,Provider,"Just time for you, Tom to take a break time to take some deep breaths took time to reset even if it's just an hour."
16245.0,Patient,"Probably I would either read a book or just watch a movie or something like that.

498.0,Provider,Anything or hearing anything that isn't there.
16245.0,Patient,"i've not I wouldn't say that no, I want to say that I have thoughts, but I don't see stuff like not kind of in a point I guess like this, because the verdict know."
498.0,Provider,come about your thoughts.
16245.0,Patient,"i'm saucer more like in a Defense mode, I feel, sometimes they really feel like i'm. Losing my clothes people, the people that you know I engaged, a lot more more with and, like, for example, my mother or my girlfriend somebody like that, and then people who are you know. seem more vulnerable, I would say, and then I will feel pores really sensitive regarded and distance of becoming more and more and more and highest, to the point that. And i'm becoming more defensive more sensitive regarding everything and then the bad thoughts i'm making this bunch of stores, or what if this happens, what if this happens, you know. That that person is going to do this if I don't do this, so these are thoughts that I always had because I mean i'm the only person. My mother would just go back and forth here and she's overseas right now, so I have to kind of. You know, understand like what what is she doing make sure that everything's Okay, even though with everything is going on, regarding either inside the family outside the family. um I would say in terms of that yes. Those bathos i've been having a once in a while, and there are pretty bad and. Today, to the point that I really want to like make sure I have some weapons get some guns inside the House in case something goes off, so I could like kind of defend, but she doesn't let me obviously so. I won't do it myself either I mean i'm not preaching to that point to do that because I know it's not ideal, but yeah I do have those thoughts, those are pretty strokes."
498.0,Provider,"Have you taken either with therapy to discuss like the origin of those thoughts, because I can tell that they are ruminating like you, you, you know got them through over and over again, and so. I think it's important that you take some time out with therapy just to kind of dissect the origin of them. And then deal with them in a more effective way than. Just allowing them to mull over mall over and and amplify okay okay."
16245.0,Patient,"So you can see, you don't see you don't think that's kind of normal or do you think that's part of the or."
498.0,Provider,"No, I wouldn't say that it's not normal and. it's not even necessary not it's not necessarily a question of. normalcy or abnormal see because they're just a lot of. It just a lot of things that are going on in so it sounds like you're you're coming from. a place of. Protection. But I don't I don't want that to. be something that ruminates to a point with regard to you to where you're so concerned about your ability for protection that it moves beyond that. Does that make sense."
16245.0,Patient,Yes.
498.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so the fact that i'm recommending that you. Take a deep dive into the origin of the thoughts is just so that it remains manageable with regard to yourself, not that it comes from an abnormal space. and How now that you you've kind of made a decision to take the will beat you in the evening. Do you have enough will be trained to. last until our our next will you need to schedule an appointment with me so probably. The first early January, is what I think I have available, do you have enough will be trying to last until then."

16245.0,Patient,"No, I think, as far as that's concerned. Everything is still kind of the same. Okay, and since I joined the bright health is not, not because I just feel like I didn't follow the consistency of the medication yet. To be able to get. On get. A feel like I want to start again on the evening part."
498.0,Provider,Because i've been.
16245.0,Patient,"Taking it one step at a time i'm trying to wake up when I forget about it so that's why I just put away, and then I was like you know what this is not going to work i'm just consuming medication for no reason, so I rather just take it, for, for example, be saving. So i'm just going to see like how's that going to really help me improve, so I think that's better."
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay i'll take that i'll take that. And there hasn't been any regression it's still kind of been getting started and so. that's no worries. yeah that's no problem at all, we can start again today."
