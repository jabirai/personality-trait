7800.0,Patient,"me not. Not not usually I mean before I had my daughter I would yeah come home take a little nap and then, when I. Right, I used to work a lot of night shift jobs, before I have heard, but i've been trying to change that around because she wants to be up one arm up and they. don't want her to see me up all night."
206.0,Provider,That pattern yeah.
7800.0,Patient,"i'm trying to fight my. What I want, and what I need so. yeah her on a day shift schedule and hopefully become a day daytime person. I tell you I could I could get a ton of sleep at night or no sleep at all, no matter what i'm tired throughout the day and at night time I wake up."
206.0,Provider,"yeah some people. If you used to work at night, so your body may be used to that type of schedule. So what's your daughter's. sleep time. Are you laughing in the background."
7800.0,Patient,tomboy she's a man with a tool cart. yeah she she she wants to be like her dad or somebody.
206.0,Provider,Okay. nothing wrong with it i'll female does everything now.
7800.0,Patient,You know gosh it's crazy.
206.0,Provider,what's a sleep time for you.
7800.0,Patient,She goes to sleep a little later than what I would like her to. Usually about 1130.
206.0,Provider,Oh wow that's probably.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah no. i'm telling you like it when she was when I first had her because I worked, the night shift job, while I was pregnant. I didn't know, I was pregnant, for several months, and to the pregnancy so i'm not kind of late. Late for me to switch jobs, because nobody wanted to let me off from maternity leave. gotcha a chef that the job I was that was completely filled, so I had to stick with it. It was it was rough especially being pregnant, but take get over here now. i'm sorry that's my dog he's nosy. But uh yeah So when I first had her, she was on that stupid."
206.0,Provider,schedule yeah.
7800.0,Patient,"She would not sleep at night, even though I was, I was tired, I mean for the first couple probably about six months. And I needed to like recuperate from being pregnant and even when I wanted to sleep, she was like she."
206.0,Provider,She had that nine times better.
7800.0,Patient,"So it's like her slowly over the past. couple years have been like changing her out of it. But it's fun it's harder than what you think even for her being that young like. I tried to force her to go to sleep, you know. yeah there she won't get me in trouble so just lay there."
206.0,Provider,What she just wants me wow those the have a wood same file so get ready for bed.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah we usually I get her in the bath and then she usually I usually let her have a snack. She most the time like like either gets like an apple or a yogurt or something like that, and then. I usually let her watch like one little cartoon or something like scooby Doo or something with choose them to dinosaurs so she watching some dinosaurs to, and then we just kind of lay there, and like I said I let her watch the TV, for the first half hour to kind of calm down. relax just laying there. And then I turned it off, and sometimes she'll go right to sleep and other times will be land, air from 11 to 1230 and should she's not talking she's not moving really I mean to roll over and stuff but. You won't go to sleep Jesus."
206.0,Provider,wow and then what time she gets up.
7800.0,Patient,She sleeps a good 11 hours 11 to 12 hours.
206.0,Provider,Of shorts later in the gets up later in the day.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah because 11 or 1130 depending on sometimes. Sometimes she'll get up earlier, but most of the time she likes to sleep in and i'm working really bad this such a big thing in my house right now is sleep I hate I hate my sleep schedule. To focus on her so she's not like that."
206.0,Provider,mm hmm. card and.
7800.0,Patient,electrolytes very.
206.0,Provider,"Hard I know the would change something gets. she's used to something already so it's like. something different, it was like. gonna take some time to gradually get out of that would change so, especially if your work schedule kind of like up and down, so it makes it a bit harder, so if you guys get home by. Hopefully, seven. equals like you know getting to wind down have a bit earlier."
7800.0,Patient,Right.
206.0,Provider,But a few things on a consistent and it gets more challenging to get that done.
7800.0,Patient,Right. it's kind of frustrating.
206.0,Provider,just giving you some instructions.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah were you born on 30 she thinks she's growing. But. yeah like that's it's hard not not to take the overtime, when I get it, even though sometimes i'm like really I don't want to work, I want to go home and."
206.0,Provider,"So what do you. Have the money it helps. But does it is it really that makes a big of a difference in Tokyo salary, when you do the overtime."
7800.0,Patient,"and see that's what like the first few like the first four to six hours that. that's the same pay i'm just because i'm on a 36 hour i'm supposed to be on 36 hours. So the. First, four to six hours is not like my regular pay, but everything after that is time and a half, and if I work a Hall, on my own, which there lately, I have been doing a lot. Of alone work."
206.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7800.0,Patient,me double time because each hall is meant for two people.
206.0,Provider,working to people's job.
7800.0,Patient,"So, again."
206.0,Provider,"What is good that they don't get compensated for that, because if you're doing a lot more work."
7800.0,Patient,"yeah you know it was kind of Nice because, where I was at before then. I could do a handstand on top of the tightrope and Las Vegas and they would not care. Really, they do, they do really show that they appreciate me and what I do and I appreciate that you know, Paul gesture."
206.0,Provider,Is give us incentive so.
7800.0,Patient,"It makes it worth it, but I don't know money is so it's such a weird thing it seems like you know, like like I make a decent amount of money right now and then a check and pay bills and."
206.0,Provider,You spend more time. Making yeah.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah it's crazy like it, this money goes so fast, no matter how much I work and where. It just looks like there's always something that needs to be paid for it. it's not regular bills, then you know something goes wrong on the car or the dog gets sick."
206.0,Provider,"it's always something. Yes, I you know in Atlanta, sometimes it will save because."
7800.0,Patient,"Trying to keep up. My main goals, I always put that on my surveys to to save money, because it is really a hard hard thing to do, especially. Before I had my daughter, I could say Oh, I was great at it, because I can I can go without you know I can put muscle on Sir. and Thank you baby that's beautiful but with her it's it's not like that you know i'm not going to make her do about because i'm trying to. Save dollars or."
206.0,Provider,We put our needs for us.
7800.0,Patient,yeah.
206.0,Provider,And that's what being a good mother.
7800.0,Patient,Thank you. I appreciate it.
206.0,Provider,"um you know, the main primary goals you say, with the same in and paying off your car, are you working with the paint off the car."
7800.0,Patient,yeah actually only have out of six well almost 7000 I only have 1800 left.
206.0,Provider,Oh wow.
7800.0,Patient,This week it'll be john please stop. Now you know better you're trying to show out because i'm on the phone stop. But um yeah I have a payment this week and that should bring it down to. 1500.
206.0,Provider,Good progress for that.
7800.0,Patient,"I am certainly trying. Using overtime, for a good purpose."
206.0,Provider,"What, then, it makes sense because you have a goal in mind. yeah yeah."
7800.0,Patient,"Like I said, you know i'm. I do get easily the forest very easily so. Being in a workplace where you have to you know you have to be kind of kind of happy a little bit, you have to at least make them think that you're happy. And you have to socialize with these in some some of the older people are funny you know they got the conversation so kind of helps. Being."
206.0,Provider,"Sick interaction, but when you do get off for like, then, how do you feel."
7800.0,Patient,"Usually better usually. Sometimes you know where i'm just in a in a mood or run, I just have to let that day pass you know I can't get out of it, I just try to go to bed as early as I can. Because most days it gets better, but some days it just don't and I used to get so mad about that, like Why can I, I can I get this situated or I can I get it under control for made me so mad, but I can't control it, if i'm having a bad day and. i'm just gonna have to deal with it and. I finally after forever learn that so."
206.0,Provider,"yeah. Little by little, you learn the point ways to cope with situation. So what do you think that. That situation that mostly triggers those emotions feeling, you know the press. i'm not able to control what's going on around you."
7800.0,Patient,"Well, for me. it's kind of sad really because it shouldn't be like a long list of things that can control or like Ben you or your will feel a certain way. But a lot, a lot of my emotions. My. The people around me, you know, like if she's having a rough rough day or just you know, not in a good mood and being cranky or being bad which I mean she's very my gosh she's going to have many decades. yeah you know I give her dad like we're together we live together and. If he's having a rough day so. I really kind of reflect off of other people."
206.0,Provider,So you taken on everybody else emotion.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like I do and it's it's I don't mean to adjust. Everybody always says, you get what you give with me and and didn't really understand what they meant by that I think it's just like like I reflect on people like if you're in a good mood and happy and joking around. will be that's. Good yeah I usually pick up on that. That energy in. college i'm not necessarily trying to just. I can see that it's a happy situation so that usually makes me happy and. sad situation or. Frustration or anything I usually follow that to, even though I don't want to. not let anyone um. You know, like a perfect stranger. can affect it and then just just."
206.0,Provider,The phone is muted. us saying another thing.
7800.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I was just saying another thing is before I was able to get this overtime was like money like. There would be you know, a day, where your brother broke or I know there was something from nope we were going to need for it. Yes, so quickly over it. I can't control it so."
206.0,Provider,"By the way, the first time we you notice that in yourself in terms of how you've taken on emotions and you know feeling stressed, and the situation that. kind of out of your control. Once you're. Aware of those triggers the next step is to when they do come. What can you do. To start, so it doesn't make you fails, so the price of having you know those episodes sadness for things that you can truly in our control. Part of it is. Finding things that make you. That you get pleasure. From i'll give you some type of satisfaction. So you. everybody's at should today."
7800.0,Patient,yeah.
206.0,Provider,"So that's. Good so there's gonna be some things that I want you to think about in terms of. When you know there's an episode that triggered your emotional somebody having maybe a bad day and all of the sudden you starting to feel like that's taken on on YouTube. What can you do to break it. Because, sometimes it could be may need. Something distraction, I know, it could be hard like, with your daughter either going to have. ups and down everybody have ups and downs, but. You know, as long that the person is not getting physically your hurts or that you really need to intervene right away, certain situation you may be able to kind of step back for for a few minutes later right, and then you can compose yourself to get back to really intervene."
7800.0,Patient,Right.
206.0,Provider,"Because if you start. feeling, you know sad and at that time it'd be harder for you really to help whoever that's in the stress. Because I mean I probably. Not thinking clearly to see Okay, what do I need to do. To get. You know, things with all kind of things. So."
7800.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. I do, I do try, you know, to step back and rethink things and. I think, like the best way for me to do that and that it's hard, because you can't always redirect something you know you can always fix it."
206.0,Provider,there's a.
7800.0,Patient,"change or campaign. and i'm the type of person that even and i'm just i'm really just recently this past couple Years Learning this about myself but. I always try like if, like I said, like if there's something where i'm good stressed out about work or not having gas money or money for diapers or anything like that I will try. To find the way, like I get stuck on it, and my mind like okay well well, maybe this person, you know, maybe I can see if they need any any extra health history or. I immediately go into trying to revert to a different."
206.0,Provider,"Until fix it. Yes, and if you can't fix it then what happens with that everything can be fixed."
7800.0,Patient,"Right right, and most of the time, I will get. More frustrated but recently I would be like i've been just trying to just kind of. You know just accepted, even if I don't want to. should try to learn some way to make the best of it, I mean. You know you're just not gonna like stuff and stuffs not going to go the way you want it to."
206.0,Provider,"uh huh. that's life. We just have to learn how to adapt to those situation when it does occur and a lot of time if we we frame so thinking. It may even the worst situation, you can see something positive, out of it but it's all your thought process, you know, because if you are constantly see the negative of everything that it takes harder to see what if something can be something positive from it."
7800.0,Patient,"And I would definitely agree with that and, like. As far as. Please, thank you. But as like as far. I will I do want to say, like I do try to change things like I will try to make changes if I say something. To keep trying it and it's not working, that way, I mean that's the definition of insanity to keep trying something."
206.0,Provider,The same way.
7800.0,Patient,"So you know I do try to make changes, and I think that's something that really. When i'm really giving it like a really. really good go like i'm trying really hard to make changes to have a better outcome to do things differently so. You know, maybe it won't end up the same that I won't be frustrated because it's not turning out there saying like. Like sleeping and stuff like I have a really once I get up i'm okay. Most of the time i'm tired, but i'm you know i'm fine getting is such a struggle for. Getting bad at all."
206.0,Provider,"And it's will be difficult, because you're not you see it on a morning person in one bed so late it's gonna be hard to get up."
7800.0,Patient,"Right and that's that's what that's what i'm like okay well, maybe if i'm up all day and I get home I should be tired because i've been tired all day. No, I get my little boost of energy, so, while I do have the energy I start trying to clean and you know do things that I couldn't do because I was at work."
206.0,Provider,And why.
7800.0,Patient,"Then, sometimes I will just like you know what, even though I felt was important to me, I must go to bed i'm gonna make myself go to sleep tonight and. I will lay in that bed as tired, as I physically am and. same way as mothers."
206.0,Provider,can fall asleep.
7800.0,Patient,And that's like. I you know I thought about taking like sleeping a.
206.0,Provider,Try and.
7800.0,Patient,"get to sleep earlier, you know take it early, so I can fall asleep early. And i'm just like you, I really want to go that far, with I want to involve a chemical just to sleep. And then I know like like when i'm sick I usually try to take night bond April. Like for will make. me tired like i'm like if I take a sleep aid to go to sleep is that actually wants to help me or is it just kind of make me not want to get up more so rough spot to make a decision about because I don't want to make it worse, so I really bad I mean. And it's great that is such a morning person, I have no idea how we ever got together."
206.0,Provider,"And and. The other part because you don't as well, absolutely. So so. you're gonna have to be. With her so she fall you fall asleep so it's. A yeah so well spot for."
7800.0,Patient,"For sure no one down my I never used to know what my mom meant like I need you to go to sleep, so I can go to sleep on my phone. perfect sense now."
206.0,Provider,"But you know the. The best thing is to try Scott, you know, trying to start the night, a little bit earlier. A little bit at a time until she gets us so. Leah nighttime. Because eventually you're gonna be going to school who's gonna have to wake up early so. You don't want that baby. having to go quick can get us to be ready so i'll be frustrated."
7800.0,Patient,"And that's. That is one of the biggest reasons, if I mean. The number one reason is, I know what this is like i'm living. For myself, so I always want better for her. I want her to go through the same thing if i'm struggling so hard with it and. The second reason is the one you just said, school. You can't just tell the teacher hey go to sleep so. Sorry, you can't do that."
206.0,Provider,But what. What she's she's young and you can still work with on would think she'll she'll pick it up.
7800.0,Patient,very smart.
206.0,Provider,So.
7800.0,Patient,"Hopefully, hopefully, I can get us both straighten out I don't think she's born to be as big of a problem as."
206.0,Provider,mayor wants to start going early that would get you to relax and finally fall asleep at at a decent time as well. So um any. Other difficulty or triggers with substance use that's the last time we met.
7800.0,Patient,No actually I feel like it's. penguin better. I was having. I talked to.
206.0,Provider,Julie.
7800.0,Patient,"Julie, I wanted to say natalie and I know. I talked about I was, I was having a lot of cravings. At night time. Like I would start. Having like kind of. Some symptoms like of withdrawal, like towards the middle of the night. I would try to take you know take less REPS and when I wake up and then take another one just to kind of finish the day off well. It seemed like for some reason that second one would just kind of where our."
206.0,Provider,Little early.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah and she did up my dosage by a little bit and it seemed like even though just a little bit it's I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I mean it's it's a lot better I don't have so many craving says. I tell you, most people won't admit this but it's really not that hard until your shake."
206.0,Provider,joel's.
7800.0,Patient,"Sorry. Yes, oh yeah i'm you know that that is the hard part. is to go through and. I mean, maybe, maybe other people are different, but I think, for the most part it's. not bad, if I have my medication it's not that hard time getting spots and oh my gosh you know I. get this like I just want to be numb but then I think about everything that has been a default I don't even want it anymore. That thought never last for long. term so. I feel like i'm doing better now that she."
206.0,Provider,"adjusted my medicine good Okay, and are you taking any other medication for mental health well and guided depression."
7800.0,Patient,She does have me on an antidepressant. She said it would take about a month.
206.0,Provider,Before it will yeah take before yeah did you start it.
7800.0,Patient,"I did i'm. Naturally I don't I don't feel any changes, yet, but i'm i'm hopeful i'm hoping, maybe."
206.0,Provider,yeah it does take. A few weeks to get in your system to kind of take the fact that in it so so just hang in there and see a month from now you start telling.
7800.0,Patient,"Her I told her you know I don't know i've just always assumed this depression, because. that's what everybody told me, I was, I mean even growing up i've struggled before ever touch any drugs or anything. Like all you're depressed I am I sick and depressed. Right referring and I don't know what's wrong."
206.0,Provider,yeah loss of interest and yeah.
7800.0,Patient,"yeah I just think. it's really hard to explain to someone that cares about you what's wrong, why are you upset."
206.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah.
7800.0,Patient,I do not know your crime it's serious enough to make you cry like yeah.
