And like my money ego or my whatever my consciousness is just like okay we've had enough of it. You know. mm hmm but I mean it can be various things I also. have been like I started walking. it's called like Gaia TV, I think it is but there's a lot of. there's different things on there there's like seeking truth videos there's spiritual videos you know. Just like I watched a video on like. The government and how like 99.9 of us are like asleep well you know the man behind the curtain rolls this world and, as I mean I don't believe in. coincidence, so what we're saying was pretty. Real to me."
207.0,Provider,So what brought you to that point of even seeking all of it out like. In for you like. Your spiritual awakening can be just for some people.
3206.0,Patient,"Right right um well back in April and I had an accident well. I like somebody was calling left Center at me and he was on a curve in my mind start clicking like okay if we're on a curve and it will take much for him to come, you know to me well. I had to so I caught the wheel and I had to go off road, because I was in a line of traffic, and so I didn't want to go back into traffic, and so I ended up just like kind of like ramping over this little. covert ditch thing. And I tried to just write it out, and then I just kind of slumped into the ditch it wasn't a big incident, I mean I didn't even. break a mirror on my call note, I mean it wasn't a big accident or anything. But. I had this might sound crazy, but when I was going off the room, when I like rant a little bit I seen a swear i've seen an angel. And like what happened, like everything just turned to like slow motion. There wasn't sound like I seen my curtain airbags deployed with there was no sound, you know it was weird. And I remember feeling very calm very like safe calm I knew I was going to be okay. And like a loving feeling. I seen in this flash it was just like he was there, and he wasn't there. And this huge I mean he was huge what tall angel and his wings, or like out like spread out and, but they were so like big I felt like he could just like wrap my like wrap my car. And like he was like his hands are up like this towards the sky and he was looking up and was holding like a I don't know, maybe a sword don't quote me on that or something like that. um. But it was just that flash in that moment, was really weird. And so I know my brain was you know, I was rationalizing time myself, it was just a. I don't know. But it was so bright light the light."
207.0,Provider,You were the only one that. Did you pass out during this accident.
3206.0,Patient,"No, no."
207.0,Provider,Go.
3206.0,Patient,back even into the ditch and everybody started coming over to me they were like are you okay like I think she's in shock and i'm like i'm fine from the accident know.
207.0,Provider,Based on what I just saw.
3206.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, it was."
207.0,Provider,"awesome. I know I think y'all. So, and so you said after that experience you started on this journey of seeking out what for you, what is that."
3206.0,Patient,"I just started wondering. Why, there was an angel there, or if that's what it was."
207.0,Provider,"All your truth is your truth you what you saw is real key. Okay, I can say hey I believe that's exactly what because it's what I believe in. On to another person who is just like yeah you are you what your truth is that you're really high and maybe that's what you saw but you know what you thought her right. And so, and so I think it's owning that I know what I saw and I know what is true. And even though you can I know what I saw and I know what is true and so now continue from that moment that the truth was I saw this angel what appeared to be an angel with wings looking up in this is what was happening, and it was just it was."
3206.0,Patient,"Never like I said I was never religious I don't even know the story or the history of the Bible or anything but. I started kind of YouTube doing. Some things, but I was trying to look up something for my son on YouTube actually so it had nothing to do with me but. It started playing a video because I had the headphones on and start playing with like an ad or something you know. And it says something about an angel and I happened to look at it. And it was an ad about. Is Archangel Michael visiting. And I was like a police lineup I was like that's. that's who was. Like I know that's."
207.0,Provider,The.
3206.0,Patient,"way that they had him, you know pictured or whatever I was like back then like that's who was there and and come to find out, they say the art he you know he's an Archangel of protection or whatever. So I mean. That that was him and he was holding a sword and."
207.0,Provider,"that's the first so would you say that would be the first the second the third time, you can image."
3206.0,Patient,The first time I didn't know about Arc angels I didn't know.
207.0,Provider,What is. So what is the use of video state is your Archangel Michael visiting you. yeah and what else it is.
3206.0,Patient,"Time assigns the Ark angels are visiting you. And then I went through the different angels, you know Archangel Michael Archangel Gabriel I didn't know."
207.0,Provider,"And then, after that what happened."
3206.0,Patient,"After that I started watching like I watched that video. or whatever, and people are having the same similar feelings like just filling a blob when they're near. You know and safe and calmness and. Just. it's just weird. I mean. After that experience for me, I guess, confirmed it for me, and it was real."
207.0,Provider,And since then you've been on this question. You said it was a spiritual awakening but have you been on a quest to find out more or to get a better understanding.
3206.0,Patient,"A better understanding yeah because I feel like you know it wasn't really like it wasn't a bad accident I just kind of ditched it like, why was he there wasn't a bad as to them, but maybe he could have tweaked something in the accident, I don't know you know what I mean like."
207.0,Provider,"What, what do you think so you so looking back reflecting back because our spiritual I agree, I, I believe that religion is more the understanding. Of. You know I, and I think you heard me saying group, some people say higher power, I say God. Is religion is just the Foundation is the understanding the spirituality, I believe, is the intimacy. So it's kind of like let me see how I can explain it. Okay, so like your your your boyfriend what's his name is. justin okay justin is the religion everything I want to know about justin i'm going to do my research about this man in front of me. i'm going to talk a lot here from his dad his mom his family members they're going to tell me everything i'm going to learn. The things his his his do's and don'ts what he likened wasn't doesn't it's the understanding of it and they're laying out the Foundation, so I know the individual I need to be adjusted right. I believe the spirituality is that intimate relationship if you're doing your own to the interview getting to know him and which one is more important the intimacy or I wouldn't even say more important, both the goes together. Because the intimacy is the experience that you've had with him. And the experience I believe there's going to be more depth to the experience than just the the knowledge and the getting to know they both go together. Because you know who justin Is it based on what mom dad and to me that's what religion is you can take a home Bible and people who think whatever it is, and you can read it. And you'll get a deeper understanding and you're getting to know who this individual is, but now I get to experience. This intimate relationship with this individual and sacks deeper that's what wow now i'm going to i'm going to make sure I do everything to honor to serve and to be who I need to be to justin. Because of this intimate relationship i've gotten to see just in like no other i've gotten to experience it and that's kind of an to me when I look at my spiritual awakening that's when you say i'm now this whole feeling of gratitude and. You know you're just. thankful for everything, even the little human thankful for double ancestry back to kill because it's taken over."
3206.0,Patient,yeti I literally say the offer and put him outside.
207.0,Provider,"That spiritual awakening and your job is grateful you step outside and now you look at the world. So differently you're you're grateful for the leaves you're grateful for all of that, then after you go through this moment on gratitude, then it goes into different now, you say that you have that dark side is coming to that place of your understanding that this world that we live in. Like hold on. it's a real objects of mess of. People in and people do it and not recognize like you just did something, and do you not realize what you did wrong. Like are you so blinded by the fact that what you did was wrong so like you think about your past and even though you said that it's hard to forgive this individual for what they've done. And even though you've released individual, but you still look have a look at them and they eat they just can't, and this is where the spiritual a spiritual awakening they just can't comprehend. they're wrong, where do you see it and you're like oh my God that is so wrong and like, how could I have done this for so long and no I can't do I can't continue to engage in a certain action. yeah but then other people, and so, like the dark side and there's there's there's definitely a spiritual awakening, but the question is. As you embark, if this is something that you really want to be embark on. There is a lot to learn."
3206.0,Patient,"So yeah, but I think it's a lot of healing."
207.0,Provider,going on. In what way. For you.
3206.0,Patient,"I mean, I told justin that I forgiving. When I do just because I don't have time for petty. arguments. yeah. And I know that i'm feel like i'm healing from that just because I don't I don't put up with the petty stuff more. I forget a lot lot easier, the one I used to and."
207.0,Provider,That was the biggest thing struggled with a lot.
3206.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"And in your. Research and watching these, whether it be YouTube videos or what have you what have you come up with so far."
3206.0,Patient,"And I just I just learned that there was different. stages and phases to it, I mean I didn't really understand why we went through it. You know, does everybody do it or there's just certain people do it, you know what I mean i'm still kind of learning about it but. Before we were in a lot that went on. Just since. I realized. You know. And I can point out that okay yeah I did do that and, yes, I did feel that way and yeah I do realize on. Changing you know. For the better definitely. I don't know I just I thought I was going crazy there for a minute so it's nice to have some validation that people do go through this."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. You know, every we go through it in different ways, and what brings what makes that Aha moment it's just it's just different it's just different. For I don't want to say, from a. spiritual religious standpoint, it also comes down to it, taps into do you believe. Do you believe in it taps into that as well. in the sense that. It taps into you know. It brings you to that places. Do you believe that there is a power for something greater than you and then it's greater than anyone on the. tour."
3206.0,Patient,"I also, it also has taken me to learn a lot about just the universe, you know. I mean and aliens and all kinds of things and I do believe there's aliens. or other other life out there, I mean for somebody to think that it's just us it's kind of ridiculous. But."
207.0,Provider,"You know. As your on your as you embark is, this is a journey that you want to embark on as you embark on it, you be careful, because now you don't send all kinds of different stuff to you. have electricity or confused. So yeah its meaning. Myself mindful of what you embark on but then it taps into your belief, do you believe in God, do you believe in Allah we believe in this. Food or do you believe in a kirshner like what exactly because a spiritual awakening brings you to identify what to do believe. You understand what I believe it might be different from what somebody else believe I believe there's only one God other people might believe no there's many thoughts. And so, as you embark on this spiritual journey. It will take you on that path now maybe what I would say is continue to do your search on. The angel Michael your guardian angel Michael."
3206.0,Patient,yeah it was crazy. So for.
207.0,Provider,Anyone that continue on that path.
3206.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Do you like what you've been feeling since then, in terms of internally."
3206.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. yeah definitely just. it's weird how it's changed me a lot. it's like you, almost want to stay in that. In that you know in that phase that that bliss phase. But it doesn't you don't see there."
207.0,Provider,Of course you don't.
3206.0,Patient,"Like the dark night of the soul, is what I is what i've researched that's how I feel now. But it's just for my understanding, like I said it's it's you're still bringing up all of these you know issues that you have or past issues that you have i've even read that you know people found it wasn't even their issue, it was an issue they had in a past life, I do believe in reincarnation. So it's just it's crazy what happens, but it's. I don't know kinda like the death of that ego and you're just kind of reborn again with a new ego. And mindfulness mindfulness yeah."
207.0,Provider,"A lot of mindfulness takes up in the mind. It surely does. I have my appointment my next appointment, but very interesting conversation damage crystal."
3206.0,Patient,I know right.
207.0,Provider,"You don't have another appointment scheduled to. All right, so let you choose to. Do it."
3206.0,Patient,alrighty.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and your data from the group this week right."
3206.0,Patient,"Yes, man tomorrow."
207.0,Provider,"just get if you have any survey well no it's nothing popping up for serving. Okay, all right i'll see you on everything okay."
3206.0,Patient,"Okay, love have a good day."
