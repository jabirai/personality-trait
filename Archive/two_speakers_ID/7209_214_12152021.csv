214.0,Provider,wow.
7209.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm not talking about like we're high up in the mountains or. We are literally like 10 minutes from the beach so we're probably like 20 feet above sea level. So yeah it's been. Some crazy weather here. Okay, and we're supposed to get rain and 39 degrees again tonight so. But other than that ya know anything's been good fine. dad's."

214.0,Provider,All day.
7209.0,Patient,"Jesus, please."
214.0,Provider,Okay.
7209.0,Patient,"So yeah I had an MRI yesterday. Because i'm. From initial blips that there's an APP for my insurance my medical provider. So a lot of times stuff will pop up on there before the doctors, Dr eight plus I have the CD I have to take a look, because I have the CD for the MRI, but it was supposed to be the brain and the brainstem. and One of the things that. popped up in my medical APP was an injury, that I was actually the kind of like the beginning of the progression of the disease in 2016. yeah I was. sitting in you know, one of those walkers that has a chair. And I was on a slight downslope but I had the brakes on and. The brakes didn't work and it just started rolling backwards as me in it part of the disease is that. Your brain doesn't communicate correctly with your muscles. Okay, so what would have been the logical thing to do is just simply stand up. didn't happen my brain just kind of went uh. And I ended up writing the the Walker all the way to the end, which was. A flower bed that was about two inches three inches deep without the dirt in it, because they kept pushing it away. When the Walker flipped over. And I landed with my shoulder on the driveway in my head on the pavement. And so, because there was no dirt in a flower bed my neck didn't have anything to stop it. And so I continued down. So, at that point, I immediately went. To the urgent care they took X rays, and the not the first vertebrae the goes right up into the base of the skull but the next three cervical. were all. pushed forward like an inch and a half. And a zigzag. and basically that the doctors told me they're like if if you trip if you go over a bad bump if you you're like this far away from having your spinal cord pinched. So take it easy so yeah what do I do I I go on the mini takes the state's route. Because i'm stupid like that. But I mean I wore my color the whole time we were careful I wrote a lot of the time with my dad in the rv so. But. yeah just been really careful I haven't done that was kind of the end of the driving for me. Right once that happened, so I guess when the MRI came through yesterday that diagnosis had been taken off of my chart because it was no longer active and I noticed, the first thing they put back on the chart was that diagnosis. Right, but what I have to find out, I guess, from looking it up is that. The shift of those vertebrae. Are are rated one through four. And one being 25% of. The disc in your cervical vertebrae is bulging in touching the next one, for being your disc is out of here for. Right, so we don't know what it is, but it was interesting because the day before the MRI having a lot of neck pain and I just stretched my neck. And it sounded like I had just walked across like a giant bubble wrap."
214.0,Provider,yeah.
7209.0,Patient,and call and looked over to me he goes oh my God reset your neck to the heard it from like truth.
214.0,Provider,yeah.
7209.0,Patient,"So, and then they did the MRI so I don't know if that did anything, or what so. it's hard to the doctor but. Basically, my neck is fubar it again. So that's all I know, right now, I gotta take a look at the MRI just myself as the CD. and see. Where. You know, like i'm interested in what's going on with that left side, where I had that. explosion in the side of my brain. Right about six months ago, so. I don't know what they're doing with that or I haven't seen anything about it, yet so. going to make an appointment with the doctor to kind of get a. Read on what's going on with brain. But they made obviously made some updates to the SPS diagnosis, because that was flagged too, but again, it read it. So that's not where I am I don't know that anything else sign."
214.0,Provider,With the holidays look like.
7209.0,Patient,"i'm. Good I guess um. I guess my daughter's just enough with my father that she decided not to go. Okay um he offered her. to fly her. From Vegas of their Christmas. And she talked to me about it and I went oh. And she goes wait he didn't offer to fly you up I said no, he didn't offer anything for us and she's like well screw that i'm my villain."
214.0,Provider,Okay.
7209.0,Patient,You know she Paula she always apologizing to me for everybody else's behavior towards me and i'm like stop. And you know because it's not your fault. All adjusted stuff you're responsible for not the stuff you're not responsible for.
214.0,Provider,You guys okay.
7209.0,Patient,And um. So yeah apparently when she talked to my dad again a couple days later. And she would told him that she wasn't coming he's like I don't know what you're talking about. So we could have a little dementia going on with the. dialysis and all the time he's been in a hospital.
214.0,Provider,Right.
7209.0,Patient,"You know it's one thing that it's like I told her it's hard to remember that my father is 76 years old. With this active in surprise, he still is. So. But no that's she's coming over she's doing the regular routine. um I guess the big thing is that. she's taking the car. On. The 23rd I think. Right and she'll be using it for the holidays those as of the second week of January. i'm like yes, it becomes hers when. My dad and his wife pay off the car for my benefit to give it to her. um so yeah so I was asking them. You know I understood that they hadn't finalized their bills, yet what night if they could just. pay for. This month's car payments is there we're going to pay the car off anyway. Right and they're like Oh well, we can't really do that, but we were going to give you $200 for Christmas and $200 for your birthday, so you can just use that to pay off the car and sorry my cat is being a pain right. You know, you can use the money to pay off your car and to make your insurance payment for this month hey thanks."
214.0,Provider,yeah.
7209.0,Patient,"Oh. So that's all holidays are looking she's going. To her mother's on Christmas Eve. Christmas morning with her grandmother go to the extended family as usual. And then come here for a few hours for Christmas dinner. And then. she's going to take me out to. A cheap sushi place for my birthday, three days later. And then I don't know what she's doing with their friends over the rest of the time because she's got a month and a half off. School starts again so."
214.0,Provider,So I saw. have things changed between you and con or.
7209.0,Patient,"Other getting better okay. yeah there's definitely getting better, more communication more are. realizing that you know they're there are a few times, where we're miss communicating. You know he's making assumptions that. i'm like what and you know vice versa, so. So yeah I mean that's getting better. kind of like. In my mind without telling him i've kind of. Set like a deadline. If we're not if we're not moving. forward. by February 14. i'm just going to consider this as a place i'm still stuck until ssd I get settled and then i'll just move on."
214.0,Provider,I think it's always best to be.
7209.0,Patient,"prepared, I think I don't know. yeah I just I don't understand people who. I don't know I guess. He has been a man, I took him to the hospital a couple years ago for the black widow by. You know, he just kept telling all the staff, I was the spouse and i'm like. You know no there's no ring on this finger know. and I you know. I just I guess i've seen other people do it in their relationships and I just I don't understand the people they just assume there's an assumption of a commitment with out the actual statement of the commitment. And i'm like yeah no that doesn't work for me. Okay, so so i'm like yeah. we've got all the possible holidays that it could happen until February 14 so i'm like. If that's that point, it has not happened, then you know. i'll have a good idea of what happened with the security. i'm just realizing my Celtic digger. The I have a better idea where my social security hearing went on the third of February so on though by then. What its gonna look like from there if i'm going to have an opportunity to just kind of you know, move out on my own."
214.0,Provider,Again I think it's always best to people but.
7209.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"We don't. Have no. But if we don't put timeframes on things things keep going longer and longer than it should. And it does right right if everybody's comfortable, the problem is that if we don't see by this date and what's the sense, because then it's just always open ended. I agree, I agree."
7209.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So, so I think right now is just the. Lack of stated commitment that's. Other than that we're still going through the ups and downs of depression. temper tantrums when things don't go the way they're supposed to go. I think he's still having. grief issues with. somebody who thought he thought was a good friend who is just kind of blowing them off right as he's realizing that it wasn't about being a good friend, it was about. getting into this space, so that he could control. The parking situation and the work and storage situation next door. Apparently he's been telling. Everybody that this is his face he's expanding. And Collins any kind of in front of me and go. Oh, this is your space, then you better be painting right."
214.0,Provider,Good point.
7209.0,Patient,yeah. So we're actually looking at like we might be moving in the next few months.
214.0,Provider,wow.
7209.0,Patient,"Well there's a place. That is near is actually owned by. A family that colin's done a lot of work with. they're not friends per se, they just he doesn't want to work for them. and it's. considerably cheaper than here highest security end here you're not supposed to be living in the space. Which is kind of got him on edge this if they want to come do a walk through. You know the quote unquote office is actually the bedroom so I have to lock the door. Right, so they don't get in. Over there, he says, basically everybody's living in their space so and nobody cares. You know you got fenced in storage space, you can live there, nobody gives a crap and it's a hell of a lot cheaper. And we're having a problem with this cult like church at the end of the building. is slowly spreading like mold."
214.0,Provider,Oh.
7209.0,Patient,"They initially only had one unit and then. got the next unit next to it and then because there's such a nightmare they forced up people next to them so they now have that unit. These are the people that i've had to. Go out in the back, because you know, Colin works on cars, sometimes, seven days a week. wow or he may work. Over the weekend and not a couple days during the week you know it's just all whenever the clients are able to bring the parts, especially if they're. Higher end job jobs, you know that are paying several thousand dollars. He may work on the weekend to get them done and we had a case like that. and This churches, at the end of every service on Sunday, they take up the entire back area with tables and catered food. Is one this one time was a bounce house that. They set up right in front of our garage door. Now, there were several choices for them to put. bounce house, but they put it as far away from them as possible right in front of our right in front of our garage door and we couldn't open the garage door to get car out. yeah so um they tried to pull the whole. yeah we don't understand you we're not going to come over and talk to you. Which is quite frequent with the hostile Latino Community here. i'm unfortunately for them i'm fluent in Spanish so. I was like fine if you're going to play that way i'll just switch over into your language and. The bounce house got moved immediately. But it's like it that's the kind of shit they're doing like. they're only supposed to be there on I think Friday for midnight mass and Sunday. right but they're they're probably every day of the week. And some days they're out on the corner like yelling at cars going by and selling tacos and food and shit which they don't have a permit to be doing. And a double checks in this building is not zoned an industrial building, not a commercial building. So they're not supposed to be here. yeah so it's the only reason it's a problem is because frequently at night. Somebody is living over there. And they're cooking mess. Oh it's we can smell it. And the entire because the ventilation system. it's a whole space here. is just flooded with marijuana. Like, we have to open doors to keep from getting a contact high. And yeah so when it's church, there is no parking available anywhere they get hostile. it's just so I did some research on them and i'm like I have no problems with churches doing what they need to do, but when I started doing the research on this one, I was like oh God these people they're called. Because. All they do. Is cover revelations. And I see these women walking in and they look normal, but when you drop into their life feed that they have on Facebook."
214.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7209.0,Patient,All the women are shrouded in. Had where. Try the men are all yeah it's like it's a completely different scene from. Outside to inside. And i'm just like oh God now. Because the you know the churches that that solely solely. dwell on revelations. are as far as i'm concerned or bonkers. Because that's like that that's like reading a book and citing that we're only going to read the last chapter. So yeah yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So, what are you attending another group this month."
7209.0,Patient,yeah I think on the 20th.
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so on the 20th because we've made our two sessions for December."

7209.0,Patient,"yeah that's fine that's awesome yeah and I that's The other thing I was going to ask you about is is it necessary for me to keep coming to her. Just for the most part, when we're no. One right don't matter is. check in now."
214.0,Provider,The answer is no. So um.
7209.0,Patient,"I mean it was great when we were having those when you are putting up those things like the you know, take the 90 seconds and think about it or. No, no."
214.0,Provider,"The educational part, but this is this isn't that group and."
