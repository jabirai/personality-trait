It was like always my inner person i'm talking i'm a journalist, and I even have this this note, why stick it on paper in case they did they ever do forget about him because I know when I grow. that's the reason why i'm 26 Now I want to do this feature self running because i'm not in a day. You know i'd be there for me and that's the reason why so much confidence, what is the reason why, maybe actually i'm studying drugs that's the reason why I was able to do it because. The future self anchorage a computer, so I just do these things, because I got to become better person at age 26 is when I supposed to do. When I was little I used to tell myself when i'm 25 I stopped being crystal meth But then when I got older I got a more addicted to it, I always thought. So when it came depression is just anger depression Satan especially same exact thing going to start I wasn't going to play it doesn't keep living the same life also live.

16892.0,Patient,"used to be bad, but it's like it's being mentally. Yes, like, then the other day, to the other guy when he was like he was talking about his cravings who's getting bath like damn. I tried to think of what you think about you, because the reason he said in the program honors I want to say above like at St cloud, I know that dude. Like i'm so new to the class only two months in like not even barely two months insights be like and seen it I know by similar but i'd be seen, like all these people who say things like hey I want to say something one day, but then it's like. yeah i'm planning my own battles so it's like I try not to list like I get it, I get it, I really do get a site I get cravings like a mother for like not now. I know more like at the same time, like I tell you I got computer i'm so lucky, because if I didn't get. bored I I wouldn't want to stop I wouldn't want find their had depression, I never want to stop a privately and I was getting bad I was doing bad, to the point where religious it was affecting like my family with a new out in droves. Like there was code it, you know because they left me it's not so little like I told you, I was, I was by myself, since I was little so I know I don't know where i'll be but i've been having talked with God, I know you guys religious but i've had a toxin now I just be like. Like they're like what like i'd be asking what's my purpose, but the nice thing time be knowing what's my purpose, because I don't know i'd be knowing it's like. it's something I want to do, and I just something I want to do, and I feel so lucky because, not a lot of people know what they want to do yeah they work. yeah they might have kids and stuff but that's because there was forced situations it's, not because they found it and I just be like down so lucky because I found it. And i'm positive when I say our i'm not gonna fall from our cravings this i'm so proud of it, but then the same time, like when there's regular people. And the APP cravings is identical to do you owe me they like they just be like damn like the all it really depends on the Program. But me I could depend on people supporting me in the program I could depend on my own friends, I grew up with you know a lot more position. They would have led general population, I shared it wouldn't have been the housing large House I did everything to the last day. systolic unless i'm just I feel i'm lucky to have asked the you know, Mr pachter now some tell and now all these people in my support crime in my group drug therapy I just. say."
