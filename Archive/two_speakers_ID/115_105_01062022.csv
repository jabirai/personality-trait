115.0,Patient,"Yet that's The thing is it's so difficult. I can't get it out even lots of liquids, and everything i've tried it's just it's so hard when they don't blow their nose and i'm chasing her with the little bulb trying to get it out it's it's it's a little challenging."
105.0,Provider,"And you know as the weather gets colder for some people, the aches and pains are worsened, which may affect your ability to get outside and walk what are you noticing with your eyes."
115.0,Patient,"It has. hindered this probably since the middle of December, not just because it's called the but. Not being able to do much with her, because I can't take her out walking just the way she's feeling, you know what I mean so it's just last month has been a struggle with everything, not just. Health wise, you know what I mean just exercise just sleep a little just everything everything's been off cycle. We actually were able to go sit on the porch yesterday and just kind of soak in the sun, because it wasn't windy because it's been real windy down here. And we're probably back in the 50s so it's not too cold out there, so we're able to sit on the porch and at least get some fresh air and enjoy the sunlight vitamin D."
105.0,Provider,yeah pretty important isn't it.
115.0,Patient,"yeah it is. We were so used to being outside every day just out there walking and she got a Michaela bought her a new power wheels, so we were, as I was walking up and down she was driving get on the side of me so yeah it's it's been a little. A little rough. This too shall pass, though."
105.0,Provider,"yeah it has before you'll make it through, you know that. yeah yeah. And this idea of educating yourself getting more knowledge of plant based meals does this continue to be a goal of yours."
115.0,Patient,"It it is um I was even telling my grandma was it two nights ago that. We were going to start this month just with no dairy no meat, because the mucus that the dairy. causes in your joints and in your lungs and everybody else so. we're gonna we're going to start. With no dairy no meat I got a while red meat we're going to stay with chicken and fish and we're going to see how it goes."
105.0,Provider,No red meat. yeah right. mm hmm. And another change. My recollection was you were making some changes around the red meat in the past. yeah so is the biggest change the dairy.
115.0,Patient,yeah it's gonna be the dairy.
105.0,Provider,yeah so.
115.0,Patient,"Right now, we we've had i'm not gonna lie we've had meat red meat we had it on Christmas and we have hamburgers. Last week, but that's about it so that's it's still pretty good we almost. Did the whole month without it so yeah."
105.0,Provider,OK so really only a couple times in December.
115.0,Patient,"yeah only one time, in December, and that was Christmas and now last week so yeah. So we're adding the no dairy. we've already taken the the sugary drinks out, we have water and gatorade zero. No cokes types typing yeah."
105.0,Provider,"I I have this strong suspicion that without. But, but really not only what you're removing but increasing. The vegetables, the the dark vegetables and dark fruits taking sugar out you're you're almost down to no red meat. And, and with this change getting rid of the dairy. I would be so curious to know if you experience. Less pain."
115.0,Patient,"I would make both, especially with the dairy so that's a big on my on my left that go grocery shopping probably tomorrow, because today doesn't look like have going but um. yeah to to do the no dairy because i've just read so much information about the way it feels mucus with the dairy in your joints and stuff like that so it's it's gonna be it's gonna be a little bit of a journey, because I love cheese and like sour cream. But let's see let's see how it goes."
105.0,Provider,Are you going to experiment with some of the like soy replace like alternative type things see if you can find a taste for any of them.
115.0,Patient,"i'm probably right now it's i'm just getting them out of the House in the. fridge Okay, and then we'll focus on work, we could use, in place of those like no I think my biggest thing is what am I going to use for. coffee."
105.0,Provider,Oh.
115.0,Patient,"Okay mark, what do you use."
105.0,Provider,"All so allman you can use almond milk they do make. cream are made of gosh there's so many alternatives in there, you may not see quite as many in what's your guys's Albert you have albertsons. But you for special for your alternative foods. You may start to consider going just getting a couple of those specialization like. A like a soy based sour cream or a funky cheese, you may just and you may not like the taste of this particular product, you may like one of another don't write them all off. But they're not going to be the same, but you may, but what you may like is texture you may like Oh, you know, but I missed the texture of something and so Okay, so that bland here. Maybe I can reach up more vinegar or maybe, if I can tolerate a little more salt or a little more spices to compensate. For this change, but your shoes your teeth in this experience of mass dictation. We we like it we like a particular texture and you may long for that it may not just be taste so just stay tuned in that they make like they make faking meat and it's if you just go to those probably is going to be a soy based which is plant. Alternative and they purposely they try and turn it into two to ground it looks like ground beef, I mean it looks like that it has this bit of texture to it and include that because we do want it, we we like that feeling of chewing on something. yeah and are you able to add things like almonds in a little bit more often if you're if you're having a wanting to crunch on something."
115.0,Patient,um i've always I like almonds and pistachios and and stuff like that so um yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. So yeah as far as creamer and the what I have seen is the monk fruit it's it's expensive but boy, is it good instead of sugar, so if you put sugar on something it's. Have you brought that in the House, yet monk fruit."
115.0,Patient,No i'm ready to get down on my middle tab little quick look. What am I going to. Do you call it on.
105.0,Provider,Are you going to whole foods albertsons which.
115.0,Patient,Spread there you go whole foods okay so.
105.0,Provider,"i'm going to show it to you, but I am you n K fruit and I know it sounds like your fruit it's a sweetener. So i'm going to show you the brands that you'll probably bump into."
115.0,Patient,This is a pinch you just stole my.
105.0,Provider,little piece.
115.0,Patient,yeah. let's look at the visa she's actually moving. A couple days it was just mom and it was everything her sock would fall off in her speaking she'd be mom my. mom my hair. Great good. yeah good cars.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is what it looks like you'll recognize it, and now that you're seeing it it, this is a brand that i'm certainly familiar with. Its zero net carbs zero glycaemic zero calorie it's a one to one sugar replacement and ketone friendly so for what my experiences as I can taste, an aftertaste to most alternate sweeteners and they kind of gross me out. This the way it's delivered this way, not the monk fruit by itself tried month fruit by itself. Without the chemical, you can see, where it says here with Eric through it all because that's in there, it does something to our taste buds and it's. For me, anyway, I can I can have this but I can't have just the pure extract it's just gross."
115.0,Patient,On Amazon.
105.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
115.0,Patient,cool cool. Once we get off.
105.0,Provider,"yeah they were out of it when I last looked, but it does look like it's in stock now. I try and get the three pound bag, which makes me as i'm looking at it now wondering if I should order it myself."
115.0,Patient,"order, how do we."
105.0,Provider,"Talk I had to go somewhere else it's hard to find a three pound bag, if you put sugar like if you put it on a cereal in your in your coffee it'll you'll go through it it's worth kind of getting a. Larger chunk of it. So. Big. And it's crystal it looks exactly like sugar."
115.0,Patient,They.
105.0,Provider,"All they also have an powdered sugar they make there's things you can get like muffins with it, you know you can kind of look around, but this for people if this is the first time they've ever really looked for an alternative to sugar, most people that i've talked to find this tasty."
115.0,Patient,Nice i'm gonna i'm going to order so.
105.0,Provider,"Where is it that you get your dark. leafy Greens, where do you get those."
115.0,Patient,Usually whole foods.
105.0,Provider,And what are you buying when you get a dark leafy green.
115.0,Patient,is going to be the kale and spinach.
105.0,Provider,It yeah Those are two excellent ones spinach is almost like a perfect food that's got like everything to it.
115.0,Patient,We eat a lot of a lot of spinach i'm. not really thinking i'm. i'll try to think what I have in the fridge he said kale.
105.0,Provider,kale.
115.0,Patient,kale spinach. broccoli we have. Their salary there's. there's quite a bit of reading stuff yeah i'm all time T.
105.0,Provider,"Know it's in there you've got them. Oh i'm so you're already making all these changes i'm reluctant to add more to what we're talking about, but if we just move over to this notion of actually starting to cultivate a healthy gut you may want to consider this on salads i'm going to show you something."
115.0,Patient,I am. I. marinca powder that I ordered from. This health. What is it called and it's like that Murray goes pretty good it has like a lot of like more vitamin C and all that kind of stuff prepared to oranges and stuff um. But it looks like. So herbal mind botanicals.
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
115.0,Patient,"This is. The Greens. I put this in the yogurt in practically everything that I that I eat and so when I can't. In the shakes when I can't like this last couple of days just making anything. has been a struggle with the kid in Europe, like literally I haven't been able to do much um but yeah."
105.0,Provider,Just that product say live. probiotics.
115.0,Patient,Cultures probiotic.
105.0,Provider,"Cultures okay perfect so they're live. The other thing so i'm going to show you if you start to add one more thing if you're already at whole foods and you want to experiment, let me just ask you something first do you like things that are pickled."
115.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, that is perfect, because if you want to consider adding this on your salads i'm talking about just like a spoonful of it. You will be adding on to this salad a fermented food. That adds its tangy it just takes it tastes a bit tangy and. They make these in all kinds of flavors but this one happens to be one that I like it's not just not garlicky it's not ginger ale there's lots of flavors whole foods will have this and. This is also sold, you know are ours, our stores out here are not safe way they are or other they're not albertsons their publix that's what we have out here, you know it's just a different chain and markets here but. Sometimes they'll have this I did see one of these in that in the vegetable section. it'll be it'll be in there, so this would be a way for you, if you're thinking to yourself boy I really want to get my gut and I can tell you do with this stuff you're taking I want to get my gut. Really healthy, I want to have all of the micro BIOME that it needs so that i'm producing a Sarah tone and that I need that i'm digesting exactly as I need to. Keep it starting to get that that stomach back in in alignment. This is another way to do it stick to add that would be one more thing you could add. I want to check in with you now, at this point to see if. If you think you would be able to have enough undivided attention here with me in a guided. Exercise or it's really there's just."
115.0,Patient,there's still too much. yeah I think i'm.
105.0,Provider,still pretty meaty this morning.

We. yeah I guess not really stop talking, but we would see each other on social media or whatever, just because she does live two hours away. But she's been a friend for. Most part of my life, since probably since I was probably about 20 so i've known her um. We just started talking again. and yeah again."

Type to visit an art gallery or stuff like that museums yeah but like art galleries and stuff like that i've ever I guess don't interest in it, but it's it's interesting to see other people's different work in and stuff like that support the small businesses and stuff it's not about."

115.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,And how are you behaving differently in this relationship.
115.0,Patient,"I don't know i'm not. i'm not um. I guess because we don't spend every day together it's just on the weekend, or whatever that i'm. It. When we do. When I do go over whatever it's um. I enjoy it do you know what I mean like. Probably because I haven't seen her in all week there or whatever demoed I mean that some. i'm not easily annoyed and shit like that. I don't know."
105.0,Provider,It doesn't sound like you have a lot of history of opportunities to be annoyed and see if you're handling it. yeah.
115.0,Patient,Then yeah there you go yeah that.
105.0,Provider,that's.
115.0,Patient,"I didn't know how to word it, I was gonna say I haven't been put in a situation yet. know how many yeah yeah."
105.0,Provider,And it seemed like she's gonna want more from you down the line.
115.0,Patient,"Water no I don't know what. I know we just. ran. We talked earlier in the week or whatever, and like I said over the weekend, but um yeah we'll see. where that leads right now and just just could share. yeah yeah right there right like it."
105.0,Provider,Can you picture being in. living with someone being in a relationship with someone can you picture that in your life.
115.0,Patient,"Do I picture, right now, though, but yeah I do."
105.0,Provider,What would be different about the future than now.
115.0,Patient,um. I don't know I just don't feel like i'm ready yet.
105.0,Provider,And that's kind of where i'm sort of steering the conversation you noticed that.
115.0,Patient,"You think yeah like. Like yeah like. They really know it's just. I guess there yet, I guess, under no. I think you do, but."
105.0,Provider,I think you do know.
115.0,Patient,I do like what.
105.0,Provider,"I think you do know why you're not ready, I think it's in there you just may have a hard time labeling it."
115.0,Patient,mean.
105.0,Provider,What would you have or be.
115.0,Patient,"Sometimes I can't I can't say like my sobriety because, like I said it's already five years in and yeah i'm on a low dose or whatever, but i'm. being completely sober is definitely a. theme seems to me, she does understand that I am one suboxone and I have been clean or whatever they we've talked about it. Right now, I don't know."
105.0,Provider,"You got you moved into an idea and then that didn't seem like that was really. The contingency that's maybe not the reason you're not ready, it may not be that you're on suboxone but you suspect it might be."
115.0,Patient,"No it's not that's that's not like the full reason just um. I think i'm still working on myself, you know what I mean I ain't ready to build with somebody else here and honestly."
105.0,Provider,What are you working on.
115.0,Patient,i'm trying to. Stay sober. Order and just being. Like I don't want that. I I ready for me I don't know. Commitment type thing like I ain't there yet. But. well. yeah. yeah you got to be careful with those pencils.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so turn your attention to me. For as long as you can I want you to see what's missing see if you're curious if you really understand. What it is that I would want more of or what I would want less of so just listen way out here to it yeah man I I I. i'm just taking it day by day with this relationship, I feel good when i'm around or. By ready for a full on relationship and that commitment i'm working on myself and I. i'm not ready."
115.0,Patient,"Well, not literally just working on myself like I don't know commitment. Like it scares me like I guess, to be honest, like that's what it is. I don't know. there's not. Any other ways to put it just it. Being scary."
105.0,Provider,"yeah so. To the point that maybe even mentioning to me over a year or two will take the last year, the to announce that i'm seeing someone on a weekend. would have been additional commitment, you would have said it out loud to the universe, meaning to me. It would have been a level very low level, but still when we announced something when we say i'm gonna do this i'm doing this it's an it's a commitment. Even that low level one you hadn't done until I pressed hard into what are we going to do about the socialization like I pushed really hard right."
115.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I guess what it is, is like. Our own path no worry about it, like about like my feelings or whatever, so I guess just having to answer questions is why don't mention what's going on, you know what I mean like underdog like then. i'm just to myself, I don't know noise dissonance I guess I don't like I don't like being thrilled about."
105.0,Provider,That that's it I like being grill.
115.0,Patient,yeah. questions.
105.0,Provider,yeah and in a committed relationship Do you imagine there would be questions.
115.0,Patient,yeah for sure. boy you do bleeding sometimes yeah the most of the time yeah. you're on your work.
105.0,Provider,When you're ready.
115.0,Patient,i'm ready.
105.0,Provider,"What might be. Empowering you what might help if you knew exactly, or rather more if you knew more about what it is that scares you about commitment. Do you think you would feel more empowered more confident. If you knew what it was. That scared."
115.0,Patient,Maybe like yeah maybe you don't I don't know what it is a book that scares me.
105.0,Provider,"When you're ready. All i'm going to ask you something okay. When you talk about. i'm working on myself. And then you think about i'm not ready for a commitment. see if you can come up with maybe elements that. there's something in common with i'm working on myself, I need to work on myself kind of get in touch with what you're working on. Are you working on it and this notion of maybe someday being ready for a committed relationship. Take as long as you need. well. i'd like to hear what you thought of just now just what you did with that. Are you bored your mind go."
115.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Well, get her take care of her, and then I come back to it. it's got a few minutes not too many, but we got."
115.0,Patient,It yeah yeah watch it will do it on you.
105.0,Provider,So so Rochelle in one hand put in your left hand over here like this over here is I got to work on myself.
115.0,Patient,that's really cute. Know i'm just scared of commitment.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, but this look at this word commitment just sits out here you're actually quite. predictive you have predicted that if I say i'm going to be this do this something negative is going to happen, what is it. What do you actually afraid of this word commitment doesn't have any inherent meaning."
115.0,Patient,I guess like. Who are past relationships like past relationships have always led me to relax like I don't know how. To deal with confrontation that's gonna. negative connotation without like. myself.
105.0,Provider,that's it see you do know.
115.0,Patient,"I do you want to talk about it, though. yeah yeah."
105.0,Provider,"But think about think about the the constraints, but. The thing you know you need to work on is confrontation like say the resilience your ability to move through it and literally be okay. With someone seeing a different perspective not understanding you even rejecting you your resilience to it. His way in the background, probably what you're looking for, but you know what you do, you make sure you never get to test it and so you're in the perfect sucker you have never moving forward."
115.0,Patient,"Right um, I guess, I guess, a lot of it has to do with like. Not being in relationships sober like before I was always. Either on heroin. something you heard, I mean So when I was off of them it wasn't for too long, and then that's when my relapses occur so like like now five years down, where I don't even think about drugs or anything like that. Does it scare me the. One argument or whatever it could be back down that road yeah does toy what to be put in that situation where i'm going to have to. decide like. I know this like unhealthy right now but i'm what i'm doing or whatever, but like. Oh no."
105.0,Provider,"Yes, you do."
115.0,Patient,Okay do.
105.0,Provider,You do to you do you just told me you're doing a beautiful job of explaining it I may know it's not healthy but i'm doing what what are you doing.
115.0,Patient,"I may know it's not healthy no I like this is it unhealthy so for it for ones to be healthy, like it's scary you know what I mean like. potter know. Getting so coffee."
105.0,Provider,"get your coffee come back here, look at me and I want to have one quick conversation with you. it's it's. it's what I. got jokes. we're done we're done here we're done. Well, it wouldn't be therapy if it didn't hurt just the little if you didn't have to be uncomfortable just a little. So look at me. Michelle were you uncomfortable here today, a little bit."
115.0,Patient,i'm not necessarily uncomfortable I just I. don't like. All right. Try looking at as much as you can try looking at me as much as you.
105.0,Provider,"hi. uh huh and there's a little giggle right it's different when you're looking at as much as you can coffee then bring your gaze back up your lumping long as you're lucky it's it's we're coming to the end. What if it turns out that you had a chance to live through confrontation in some small way today with me, you are kind of grilled you are asked questions. And how did you handle it, what do you know about yourself."
115.0,Patient,That I try to answer the questions um.
105.0,Provider,Did you think about using during our session.
115.0,Patient,No that's good being good say I haven't really thought about us a long time let's.
105.0,Provider,stay with me stay with me I got all that. confrontation. Is what you have not tested.
115.0,Patient,yeah that's true I haven't tested it.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you feel it here with me give yourself credit now you've had it very subtle because there's been discharged you get to play with the baby there's not a lot of. Really concentrated discomfort with me there's been a lot of ways to sort of what I call discharge some of that in here you don't look at me you look away you're busy busy busy. But for you in here, it would be in the service of long term resilience to sit with me. and be able to say to me how you're feeling oh i'm getting irritated with you, whenever I want to fucking hang up on you uh huh. listen to me listen, all the way through might as well what's at the end you're almost telling me it would be in the service of a bit of an experiment where you're testing it, because your body. your mind would be able to go wait a minute it's not actually catastrophic. being misunderstood, I know i'm selling something here being misunderstood for a second. The perception of abandonment criticism, a misunderstanding and disconnect or feeling like i'm being grilled and having to defend myself and I don't want to I don't know this lady nothing whatever okay in here. it's like kind of super safe because, like i'm straight prescribing it. Because to we get to find out in real time what's coming up. We get to use emotional regulation skills together, I get to remind you to use them. You get to feel yourself in those emotions that later on when you're with someone where love is on the line, now, you may not love me, but when there's love on the line. We get far more emotionally activated but at least you'll have some credibility with yourself to have said, I did it with this therapist lady, but she kept coming at me house mad I was like back. Right and I, and she didn't disappear. I felt it in my heart, I felt it in my chest, and in my gut and you know what I did I did this this, and this, and in fact I learned how to speak I learned how to say. i'm feeling defensive. So what do I think I think it's time. uh huh."
115.0,Patient,time for what.
105.0,Provider,"for you to practice a little bit with me. Practice a little bit yeah yeah yeah might as well because it's in the service because, frankly, what is our life really isn't it about our relationships. This is holding you back if we are maybe you want to leap over it, and be this this isolated being that doesn't want hugs and snuggles and and sex and all that maybe you wish, you could be this robot but you're not. you're not sorry. Okay, your wire, just like the rest of us. yeah people equal pain and drug use. I want, I want you to have a lived experience, at least with me so that you can build up your confidence so that you can take whatever little tiny steps towards intimacy and, yes, it will be scary but you know what you're going to be there and you're going to be okay. But you don't know that yet. So you yeah. And that very simply put we'll do it in here, and so, just a quick statement about how how did you manage to survive. This confrontation, I did you do it."
115.0,Patient,coffee.
105.0,Provider,yeah. And you're okay and we're okay.
115.0,Patient,yeah good.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's schedule something early so now. You will be challenged even more to be able to stay here there'll be less distractions you'll be right here, and it will probably be more uncomfortable for you."
115.0,Patient,Oh. yeah hold on i'll get you another folder.
105.0,Provider,"But it's gonna ready you, it means your confidence is going to go up that you can meet the world of messy people okay."
115.0,Patient,"yeah in a minute. In a minute, you can help with."
105.0,Provider,"weekend we how about. How about January 21 it's a Friday at it's sooner than later, but it's six in the morning, so we can actually come back to this more in depth."
