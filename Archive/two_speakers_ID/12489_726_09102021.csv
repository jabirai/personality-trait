12489.0,Patient,"Things and, for me, I just turned 40 in May."
726.0,Provider,"So and i'm I was just looking at your chocolate, did you have for for me here."
12489.0,Patient,"I only spoke with her briefly they moved me a few times, but I was with. Dr stuffy and who just came on board, I believe. Julie Cain was my psychologist before I came to break her house so. Okay follow them here."
726.0,Provider,And you can be in a group.
12489.0,Patient,"I do grips with Julie, every week. I inquired right now to do them every other week, but I still go every week."
726.0,Provider,"Oh that's awesome okay so and what i'm going to show you is i'm going to share my screen, so I can show you what I have here. Okay Okay, so that later today or when you have a chance you can talk to virtual clinic. Here we go. So i'm going to show you the ones you see in red those red dots. yeah filter on to surveys, I don't know if you've already done them or they sent them to you already."
12489.0,Patient,"From is that all that I did the pH Q nine survey. i'm sure. Okay, and then I don't know about the BAM."
726.0,Provider,"Okay. So what I would do is, I would ask them. um I would ask them about that i'm just to make sure it's a dog good in your chart and it's not red anymore, because red means it's overdue so if you're already. A huge queue nine is probably just not updated yet, but the BAM if you haven't done that i'm."
12489.0,Patient,"In I have been. They haven't usually Julie, let will let me know but I didn't know that. Can you just. Can I just redo them or. i'm probably saying."
726.0,Provider,yeah you could do that.
12489.0,Patient,So do I need to is there a link that you can send me or.
726.0,Provider,Virtual clinic will do that I don't have access to send it to you.
12489.0,Patient,"So. You can. Let me write it down so that I can I know the pH Q nine I I think I did that one twice, because they told me that they didn't have it last time. yeah is that the series of questions like. Do you do you think you sleep. Too much or. likely likely or zappa."
726.0,Provider,I don't know i'm not sure I don't just.
12489.0,Patient,answer questions like likely to most likely are unlikely. But the BAM it's just Bam BA.
726.0,Provider,yeah began yo and they'll know exactly which one you're talking about when you say that.
12489.0,Patient,"impeach Cuban. yeah Okay, I know i've done that one, and I think when I first started, they said I needed they didn't have it, so I did it again, I was working midnights. So I my schedules still a little. Different but they would call called me in the morning, I remember i've done the PhD one twice, I know. Okay, I know, doing them so."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I would ask them and then. Once they're done they're all set only cuz sometimes stuff if it's right on the chart it'll affect other things, and so, and those are the simplest things to do as a surveys, even though they're. boring it's just like chick chick joining just you know get it done."
12489.0,Patient,yeah no problem.
726.0,Provider,yeah so I. Was there anything that you have any concerns about our on any questions.
12489.0,Patient,"I mean no not about the program or anything I write the same therapist for years and years, and she passed away so."
726.0,Provider,sorry to hear here.
12489.0,Patient,"I just eager to get with a new therapist I can build a relationship with, and you know. You don't get switched around anymore. I address that concern with her. Because I don't want to get started working and stuff if i'm going to get and."
726.0,Provider,"I think yeah I think i'm sorry to hear about service passing away um, but I understand because it's. it's like talking to someone about things that's going things that are going on, but then it's a lot easier to continue on with therapy when you or they already know your story so it's like building from the bottom up."
12489.0,Patient,"Again with to retell the story over. and over again, no."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. So um would it be helpful if we did like for scheduling purposes, if we did around the same time, same day, every two weeks."
12489.0,Patient,"yeah, that is what. I had asked them when they scheduled us. So we're Friday I. Today, obviously, to and then September 24 it too."
726.0,Provider,Okay perfect okay.
12489.0,Patient,So yeah that's that's fine this tango is good. My son gets off the bus. yeah for so.
726.0,Provider,"So, would you wanted to, so we have an appointment, the 24th two weeks after that is on October 8 I can also do two o'clock with you. When we put that into our arm."
12489.0,Patient,"Okay, and the 24th is also Friday right."
726.0,Provider,"Yes. And, if anything, changes within that time frame, we could just figure something out. Here we go. So how long have you been with bret Hart health."
12489.0,Patient,"um just a few months, I believe I was at. Packard House before moto when Julie, let me know that she was leaving there and coming you know with that, but then again everything we were kind of doing. Over the phone anyways we weren't going I wasn't going into the clinic. She she just let me know she was leaving and I really like Julie and she already knows my whole history and. she's been great. So I wanted to stay with her, but I didn't want to leave Dr sethi either so she was my primary care and now or addiction knowledge is whatever. What she can't was coming into so I decided to come and my husband also."
726.0,Provider,Oh great. So you're both in treatment together.
12489.0,Patient,yeah we're both in your country.
726.0,Provider,that's great. that's nice to have that support.
12489.0,Patient,"yeah it's great. We were both in recovery for about eight years, and he was in a really bad car accident about three and a half years ago. medication we ended up relapse and. kind of downward spiral right back down to losing our House and it was just a disaster so. yeah we relocated from Lincoln park to saline which is way better and out of the city and. that's when we found Packard help."
726.0,Provider,"For me. And so, how are things not home."

To like no we don't do it like he's not going to do that. and Just hit themselves for just he's he's just a lot sometimes if you don't want if he is an agreement to what he's supposed to be doing. He can be.
726.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard with little kids for sure, especially when they start acting out."
12489.0,Patient,"yeah and he just seems like he's so one, probably because his sister and brother. He seems lot older than he is so even in school and go to school functions or something. He even looks older than kids he's like I don't know it's really weird like he's he's bigger and he's. I don't know like I said from my teenagers who. Does that like a regular seven year old or do something."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12489.0,Patient,get ready to leave.
726.0,Provider,"And i'm. Thinking for. Going forward, is it possible, I know we've already scheduled for the two sessions in every week at two o'clock on. So I have this because I wouldn't want to have a longer session with you, rather than just a half hour session I don't know if a half hour such a session would work out for you or, if you want a full like 45 minute session."
12489.0,Patient,"yeah that was better, for me, the longer session."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, because they scheduled you for like a half hour session."
12489.0,Patient,yeah God i'm just looking at them.
726.0,Provider,"yeah um but maybe like going forward when we schedule next time we can schedule if there's another time where I could even if you if you don't use a full hour. Where it's more than just a half hour session that we could do, because I feel like, if you want to like work on some of the stuff that's going on, that you want to. really work on I don't know if a half hour would be enough time for all of it."
12489.0,Patient,yeah probably yeah.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so I know we have two appointments already set off you do want to keep those as is for now."
12489.0,Patient,yeah I. Okay yeah or also training checking with you. Every other Friday.
