105.0,Provider,"All right, how's our audio and video you can hear and see me okay. Yes, excellent. So I was opening up a note and thinking about something you said in group and I wondered if you got any new information it sounded like your insurance was giving you a hard time um. it's interesting because I think you probably have a medicaid i'm not sure."
341.0,Patient,I do communicate yes.
105.0,Provider,"A lot of my clients do, and so I was a little surprised that yours was coming back the way it was have you talked with anyone from the insurance company or with bright heart about it."
341.0,Patient,"Right I haven't, yet they just sent me like a couple bills or it's just showing that it's actually not from right markets from my insurance, showing that during these certain dates coverages were denied because maximum maximum benefits something or some I don't know what they said it."
105.0,Provider,exceeded maximum benefits probably.
341.0,Patient,maximum benefits exactly.
105.0,Provider,"But, are you planning on calling."
341.0,Patient,"Yes, I should have done it already. no excuses just. I will call, though I think i'm thinking i'm i'm gonna do it today because I want to know what's going on, because if I gotta pay out of pocket, I want to know, I want to be able to know that you know I can be able to pay it and stuff so. I know it's not that expensive. But I just I need to know. So our call today for sure. We kind of slow yesterday and today, because of the rain and the cold so. Maybe i'll have some time."
105.0,Provider,"Would this be a good day for us to see how you're doing with some of your goals, I think if it's not the month mark on the third um. Can we do a little bit of that review."
341.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not sure exactly what goals, I had a month ago, but I, my calls change."
105.0,Provider,"Actually, they don't change a lot."
341.0,Patient,To really.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so you have had. I want to go back to school, since I met you. yeah so and so when this kind of a little newer is. I want to quit smoking cigarettes. We had just sort of put that in there, you had. importance. let's see. it's very important to me see rank eight confidence before so you you found it important at an eight and you are about confident at a four. it's important, and I believe I can do it and you identified that your confidence would go up. by at least one point if the day before I did really well so for you, seeing that you did well and one day really works to boost your confidence. Each day, moving forward so that first day pushing through the difficulty could really make the difference, what did you notice over the last month around smoking cigarettes."
341.0,Patient,"I know I work is when I smoked the most. Stress related. Because I i've caught myself at times, where i've walked towards my car because I leave my secrets in my car. I don't like today hold on maybe our peeps but, even though my car and then as i'm walking to my car there's sometimes I just like wave my hand and say that, like a smoke. And then i'll go. Do whatever whatever and then another like craving will come again, maybe even like an hour or two later and. i'll try to say no again to it, but then there's times, where. I smoke a cigarette and not even five minutes or 10 minutes later i'm grabbing another one so. I think it has mostly to do with stress at work. I need to find a. A reliable I guess. skill that i've learned to try to. keep doing while you know. it's not about remembering is just doing it. Just do it. When it's when it's man do it. And you know the cravings don't last that long you know it hits hard, I really feel like having a cigarette but if I say No five minutes later it's gone, you know i'm not even thinking about it so. I want to just find ways to keep my mind busy at work without you know I need to invest in some cinnamon sticks are those mint toothpicks and stuff like you're talking about it. yeah just having that and trying it, you know, instead of just saying Oh, I can do it, I can do it, and you know I need some support."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so we can we can add a couple things. first thing is. If you're bringing the whole pack to work and only bring three cigarettes."
341.0,Patient,yeah that's gonna like.
105.0,Provider,well.
341.0,Patient,Just thinking about it.
105.0,Provider,How many do you smoke during the eight hour workday.
341.0,Patient,"To be honest, it used to be almost a pack and now i'm down to about half a pack."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so count out one less than half a pack. and bring that with you and see what ends up happening see if. What happens is Oh, I know I only have so much, let me see if I can wait five minutes you might end up doing it, and another hour has passed, you might end up doing that it might stop you from that using it every five minutes smoking every five minutes. Because what has been effective is people only have a few they might bring six or three to work and they're like oh I I can wait, I can wait, I can wait. I don't want to not have one, at the end of the day, or something they they can they kind of see themselves do that, then what you get to learn is you really can wait. You learn, yes, yes, I can I just did it I did it because I only have three I did it because I don't want to not have one, want to wait. So just consider it as another way, the same way we're saying, make it inconvenient leave it in the car. not have access to it, you only have a few watch what your mind does, to make sure you have one what on your drive home or something like at the end of the day. To make sure that there's at least one there so just just play with that a little bit, because now your mind you'll be able to come back and give yourself evidence and that's how you're you've taught us. I need to see that I did well over here before, and I can keep that pattern going and watch when you said I went had one. Then five minutes later, I have another one, so if that would break up that you go Oh well, I need to wait I can't do it next five minutes. I need to wait, because I only have a few left to last me through the day so that might be the little piece that that interrupts that five minute back to back chain smoking. You could see if that's effective, I mean right now, because you haven't said i'm done and stopped buying them right we're not saying I stopped by them are saying only bring this many with you, so you can start to work with your mind a little bit."
341.0,Patient,"Okay, because, just like with my sister she smokes and she never takes her cigarettes to work like never you know she. comes home and then she'll have a cigarette or two and then after dinner or whatever before she goes to sleep or whatever I guess she'll have one or two and that's it, you know and she's been doing this for a long time and. I don't know I just you know, I just wish that I could. Do that also you know where I don't have to smoke at work and. But for me it's like work is the time where i've smoked so much and i've been doing it for the last 10 years now, I work that to change that just. I don't even like when I try to quit one time and at work it's just like. I was having a hard time really hard time. Without it. doesn't even do anything you know really for you, but. I don't know when I smoke a cigarette after i'm done I don't feel too good for a few minutes, I always have this like nauseous like sweaty feeling for a couple minutes and I thought, maybe that would. Like be something to say hey I don't want to feel like this anymore I won't smoke. You know, so I just i'm gonna try that maybe take a few cigarettes to work nine cigarettes to work see how that works out but that didn't work out i'm gonna try like how my sister does it without taking any city. Because I don't really have time to be going to the stores and stuff anyways."
105.0,Provider,Can I show a picture to. This maybe it's all today. let's take a look at which lungs which lines do you think of the ones of the non smoker.
341.0,Patient,The ones that are still read.
105.0,Provider,hey yeah look at these black ones it's not gross.
341.0,Patient,But is that really how smokers lungs look.
105.0,Provider,"I don't know that's just one of the things I just looked at, let me see if I can find another one. I was just something I grabbed super quick and say. let's see healthy lungs smokers long, so these actual images i'd like a big oh there we go. Good. This image comes up there, just so small, I want the. This is like an actual image looks small trying to make it a little bigger. She can see how dark it is."
341.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's actually very. black. But this is that really how smokers lunch turn to.
105.0,Provider,"It just black. Looking on the Internet here i'm looking at the same thing you could be looking at I just typed up smokers lungs images, I wanted to see what they look like, I mean. You think that it's just a scare tactic."
341.0,Patient,"It works, because my uncle rudy he smoked for 50 something years and they told him yeah your lungs are bad you're gonna you're not gonna live if you keep smoking and he quit cold Turkey and he's been good for over. it's been like a year and three months now, my mom quit eight days after him because she went to the hospital also it was like an unrelated. She went to the hospital also and they told her your lungs are messed up, you need to quit smoking and she quit that day, and she hasn't smoked in a year and three months. So, most of them were from the same time both cold Turkey knows both their doctors told him that later died. I think scare tactics do work. Seeing those black lungs just make me sick today, you know, and then I don't want to end up you know I don't want to be hurtful to my dad or nothing but him being COPD and then coughing and still smoking and not being able to breathe and. Then, knowing that it's killing him and is probably want to kill them someday soon. And to still continue to smoke two packs a day I don't want to be that."
105.0,Provider,Every image i've looked at looks like this.
341.0,Patient,"yeah must be true that. That sounds about right though, because I mean you're putting smoking your lung and if you ever smoked anything it turns black. As disgusting."
105.0,Provider,"I mean, how can, how can cancer not develop their you're you're changing the. The cells, you know, so you it is incredibly dangerous."
341.0,Patient,"yeah they say 400,000 people a year. die from it."
105.0,Provider,Is there a part of you that doesn't want to live as this like your way of of slowly killing yourself and that's perfectly fine is that what you're up to you.
341.0,Patient,"know because i've been smoking, for a long time, and then you know I even smoke when I loved. Everything about life and life was exciting to me, you know as. I kind of always been a smoker. i've quit a few times, while I was locked up in prison, I didn't smoke. Soon, as I got out and they took me to the bus stop there was a store right across the street I bought a pack of cigarettes."
105.0,Provider,"Or you could have gotten them in custody, why did you decide to not smoke there."
341.0,Patient,"Well, in California, it was in California and they don't allow cigarettes in there it's actually a contract and you get them because people bring in roll your own tobacco and it's all over but it's expensive and. I just I don't know I just didn't smoke played a lot of basketball, and we weren't me my my friends that I hung out with. While I was locked up, we worked out every day. Just never thought, as I never thought I thought in my head, while I was in there as we're always occupied with working up playing pinnacle. Joking around you know. Even like well that when we stayed up late late when we had late nights always stayed up drinking coffee, no one ever brought up sitter so stop you know, a couple friends would hit the corner or whatever and they'll smoker Syria, but we never said all this, go join it, you know it's just."
105.0,Provider,"So you just hear what you said, learn from what you're saying learn from it, what did you learn about how you didn't smoke in jail what was there that's not in your life right now. don't just."
341.0,Patient,Keep. Myself busy.
105.0,Provider,"fun activities um there's some socialization. You were brought into custody and no more cigarette smoking right. So this thing you do, where you say oh i'm so scared or whatever this panic happens to you, you survived it with no progression down you just full stop. But what it took was what's called an external motivator you had to have the constraint, have no access to it, you relying on yourself as soon as you were able to you went and got them when you got off the bus. well. Too bad. It either you can't go to jail, just to quit smoking right, but you can create that, but you can create it by leaving it at home."
341.0,Patient,"Yes, created."
105.0,Provider,"I saying dad hide the rest of the pack, I want to get down to six, a day, I want to get down to five a day next week next week, I want to get down to four. And yeah it's going to take extra effort. Do your the likelihood Anthony that you're going to get sick from what you're doing the fact that short this feels good now you don't want to look ahead and see what you're doing that's going to hit you one of these days, and you can't go back can't go back."
341.0,Patient,"that's what i'm afraid of that's you know and then i've been smoking actually for a long time and. I don't I just I don't want to have COPD I don't want the doctor to tell me oh you got lung cancer. you're gonna die soon you know I just you know I know you know i'm not afraid of death, I really am not I just don't want to die, you know, right now, I want to. see my daughter grow up, I want to be here to support and stuff I want to. You know, I just want to enjoy things that I didn't enjoy for the last 20 years you know because I used to enjoy life a lot, you know even just hanging out or sitting around or we used to go to anthony's pizza on base and can walk in Korea and just sit there they had like a little. jukebox that played music videos and we'd always play the same ones, and it always have this one with weird Al yankovic pitch. i'm fat i'm fat. always just do these little routines that are the REC Center play ping pong just these little things that we did was so exciting to meet you know and. I look forward to it all the time and now that's What I want, I just want to look forward like Bowling on Sundays, I look forward to it, it is fun, for me, so I go every Sunday, you know."
105.0,Provider,i'm so glad. That still moving down.
341.0,Patient,"Very fun thing for me and then i've been talking to people and stuff and meeting people there and i'm trying to get into a lead. everything's full now now book right now so i'm gonna have to wait like springtime but but. Most likely i'll be able to do it because I have everything that I need for, and then now, I have the knowledge of. gold go three weeks before it starts to sign up you know don't wait till three months in and then think i'm going to get in you know and i'm just working on that right now. Working on my role, which is getting better. Just enjoying life, I guess, little by little, you know."
105.0,Provider,hey that's.
341.0,Patient,"my daughter and finding too much anymore. Robin still here we barely even fight me my dad barely fight anyone anytime anybody says anything to me, I feel like I get offensive. I just come to my room close the door and that's been helping me a lot, you know not blowing up one of the other days. When when Robin and caitlin were kind of both kind of getting on me about something I don't remember what it was, I think that knows, because her hair and I told him that. don't mess, with it, you know I don't you know, let let it grow out and let her do what she wants to do, and she had cut it short in the back. And so. That that I felt like blown up and I said something to her and she told me. This is, you know i'm her mother, this is how it's going to be. You know just stay out of it and at first, I was like like almost two were like she was telling me that get out of her, but she was just telling me that. she's the one doing her hair, you know i'm not the one daughter air, you know why am I getting all up in my daughter's business better. When i'm not the one waking up in the morning fixing it and doing it and stuff like that i'm starting to realize that I needed to just stay out of things that. That i'm not supposed to be in you know and. stuff like that you know not letting things bother me so much you know even like at work, I still get angry, I still feel like punching somebody. But I laugh it off, I remember you telling me that they probably have their own problems and their own insecurities and their own things that they're going through that I don't know about. So just let them be in her, and you know, and if it's not hurting me physically or whatever, why, why should I just why should I get upset about it's not it's not really hurting me emotionally either. Then those inside little jokes about me. it's just funny to me now because I catch it now all the time, and I know that they're going to do it and it's funny that they try to hide it and it's like just do it on the open already man teach me how to do it i'll make fun of myself."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
341.0,Patient,"No it's just things like that that's keeping my stress levels down and that's so anxious angry, not knowing if i'm happy or bad and stuff like that, as I didn't like that feeling very much and I lived it for the last few years, like. Not knowing you know now that i'm starting to really know my emotions better i'm able to like realize things better like see okay hold on a second that I shouldn't get mad at that or hold on a second you know this is sad, you know, or you know."
105.0,Provider,Someone join in you.
341.0,Patient,"Know sound like somebody was shooting shopping out there. They do it all night long sometimes it's like here's three o'clock in the morning and somebody starts shooting in the air, I think I guess. You know what they're putting those things now we're a PD can actually pinpoint the area where the gunshot came from. So not catching a lot of these young kids shooting in the air and stuff you know."
105.0,Provider,that's a cool technology.
341.0,Patient,"yeah finally they came up with something you know i'm not really like person that's like oh pro long catch up, but i'm kind of getting sick of this too, so."
105.0,Provider,Those bullets come down and they can they can kill you you walking outside.
341.0,Patient,yeah. come down.
105.0,Provider,yeah you can. You can get killed with it coming down.
341.0,Patient,"that's why I tell you here don't shoot your guns up for new year's or fourth of July. Right, this is dangerous, you know so. Usually nighttime and afraid to be this early in the morning it's just like weird and I live in We live in a pretty good neighborhood you know. And now it started and then all kinds of homeless people all over the place now. I don't know anymore that's why i'm so worried about my daughter when she has to walk home and stuff like that, because all these this homeless people everywhere. And they get mad at you, and you don't want to give them five bucks."
105.0,Provider,How is it that I owe you money.
341.0,Patient,"i'll give you something to louisville slugger. But yeah i've been doing a lot better with anxiety. What what one thing that i'm having trouble with is my legs my legs are very, very painful now like, even during the day very achy very achy. bearable, but borderline bearable and unbearable like sometimes I have to just sit down and just like rub them and it feels like i'm about to start crying so. I guess i'm going to talk to Dr Gabriel about that and see because this last time I took the drug test. You know, new printer from didn't show up. It said I was negative for buprenorphine and I take it every day. it's always positive for thc and negative for everything else, even the butte so i'm wondering if my body's even metabolize the medicine."
105.0,Provider,I don't know.
341.0,Patient,"Maybe this, this is just like a withdrawal symptom or something on."
105.0,Provider,"The legs, I do wonder, I. mean i've heard of restless legs, is it is, it is there any history of pain in your legs before."
341.0,Patient,"No, just like, if you like, do hard work or say we were shoveling gravel the whole day my legs will hurt. Be sore the next day but they'll go away, this is constant up from the minute I wake up in the morning to the minute I go to bed, and then, once my bedtime is then it's like the pain and the rest of snakes together having a hard time sleeping."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, are you taking anything for sleep."
341.0,Patient,So marijuana.
105.0,Provider,"yeah um yeah talk with her, I can't hear it like a point two five now right."
341.0,Patient,yeah and we taught me in a real talk i'm gonna next group i'm dropping 2.125. And i'm going to do that. Once and then we're going to start talking about me getting off.
105.0,Provider,well.
341.0,Patient,"um, but I can still come to groups and stuff right."
105.0,Provider,yeah oh yeah.
341.0,Patient,yeah the groups and stuff. i'm just you know have that.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, I think it's a good idea. I would say. I guess, my concern is that if you go taper while you're having this symptom in your legs, it might not be successful, you might convince yourself that this is a fail. I would say talk with her, obviously, but I know I would like to hear that you're not having that pain in your legs before you go to the point 125. Because. What are you going to end up saying yourself, I mean I can't do it, or something I don't know what will happen. you've you've put a lot of work into this i'd hate to see it. unravel so. i've been listening to clients, it does look like she's had some success with a sleep medication, I had just heard recently started with a que I hadn't heard her use it before. So maybe just talk with her, you know oftentimes i've heard her you know she'll obviously the quantity and for the hot and cold sweats."
341.0,Patient,"it's a quite a p. Yes, sir."
105.0,Provider,"It is circle okay so that's just a. generic name I guess okay so circle, and some people say just take the two five milligram it seems to work and they're not drowsy in the morning, have you experimented with it yet."
341.0,Patient,yeah I i've been prescribed seroquel it puts me to sleep. that's not a problem I just wake up very low energy very.
105.0,Provider,"Is heavy tapered it back tie traded back so cut it in half, like you have and it still makes you drowsy shoot well."
341.0,Patient,Like zombie.
105.0,Provider,"Oh yeah that's not going to work shoot What about. I know it may seem silly, but if you don't use melatonin regularly it can work if you haven't been using it for a while, like months have you experimented with that did say you just go to."
341.0,Patient,The retry to.
105.0,Provider,"It doesn't make you tired. But it's not drowsy typically not drives in the morning just take two of them, they are either a little chewable or a."
341.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"yeah look, I mean just when you're years your local grocery store should have it or whole foods or something or CVs or walgreens just melatonin two of them, and it should make it tired."
341.0,Patient,"it's just i'm just. I want to get quality sleep. i've been sleeping. I fall asleep, but you know waking up three times in the middle of the night and stuff like that it's just it's rough you know, so I want quality like a good eight hours of straight sleep and I wake up feeling good."
105.0,Provider,And you've taken ibuprofen and tylenol or aspirin for the leg pain.
341.0,Patient,To leave.
105.0,Provider,"A leave Okay, and it doesn't bring relief."
341.0,Patient,It does.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and you're doing one right before you go to sleep."
341.0,Patient,I usually do to. Before I go to sleep yeah.
105.0,Provider,Well that's all the ideas I have talked to the Doc.
341.0,Patient,But just you know I just get to that point where like. I hate taking something.
105.0,Provider,"I know, but you're in you're in an important transition moment you're in this important moment. And I don't know what's happening I don't know what's going on with that pain I don't know if it's. Somehow even involved with something psychosomatic so."
341.0,Patient,"guess what i'm saying it it's hard to pinpoint I know i've always had lag issues, but the pain. All day long and has only been around like about two weeks to a month."
105.0,Provider,"So, but that's the first time i've always had leg issues, not everyone can say that what does that mean. Like always like issues."
341.0,Patient,"restless legs I don't know, like the restless legs i've had forever even. 10 years ago. When I first moved to him, like with Bridget long time ago I used to always at night have or massage my legs and then have to stretch them for a while. You know, in order for them to like relieve some kind of feeling in a for me to go to sleep, and this is way before I even did opiates and stuff like that so. So I just I don't know, I was wondered if maybe like a nerve thing."
105.0,Provider,"Our bodies have pain to signal there's something wrong. When you take an analgesic it numbs it and then you can't feel the pain signal. This might be a time for you to pay attention to the signal. you're in the habit of not doing that, but it might be time to do that."
341.0,Patient,"Because I was wondering, maybe. If it was affecting me, years ago, but since I was so doped up all the time that maybe because even work now i've. You know i'm i'm hurting you know i'm my arm and everything's hurting because it's physical work and that's just like part of working like this, as you get older you continue to work like this you're going to feel some pain and stuff. So I don't know. Like you know i'm almost a be 38 in January, so i'm still kind of young so i'm i'm thinking in my head, you know, maybe there is something wrong because I was like 50 or something, then i'd be like okay yeah. it's just me aging, you know, but I still feel like i'm young and, like my body's still. able to do physical stuff for my legs to feel like this, I just. Like. I don't know it kinda disappointed at myself for. You know, for having this you know where i'm sometimes I work I even have to tell my cousin just give me a minute i'm gonna have to go sit down for a second and I just have to go. run my legs and knock me I hit him against some tires you know and just trying to like I don't know that that. pain and then it's like a a key."
105.0,Provider,So whenever when are you going to schedule a massage company.
341.0,Patient,"Like a professional one. You know what I I would really like a massage. sister gave me a voucher. Years ago, and I went to Rio rancho and it was a various jet like aroma therapy going on and. She massage all my fingers my arms my toes and I remember, leaving that place feeling great and I felt good for like a good month. So, but it was expensive my sister paid like $120 for that."
105.0,Provider,"Okay well wait let's let's use logic. $120 right now feels like a lot and your focus in this, you know, the more I read about how the brain does this this little maneuver it doesn't want to it doesn't want to feel loss right away, it just doesn't want to think about. loss. 100 let's do this. I do use my calculator on my phone here. hundred and 25 $34 a day."
341.0,Patient,yeah that ain't.
105.0,Provider,"That ain't bad. So, if you think. How much Am I spending on cigarettes, a day that's killing me."
341.0,Patient,And bucks a day. No dollars and 19 cents actually. To be precise.
105.0,Provider,"And so, if you sat here this morning and you thought. i'm going to spend $6 on my cigarettes and $4 for this once a month massage. once a month. Just starting there don't overanalyze it just say this is the commitment i'm going to do i'm going to go schedule when. You schedule it you get a lot of value from it, and you can come back and you can say this help this didn't help but also looking for one that might not be as expensive. But Anthony you have had years of this pain and not spend $120 a week, you have a lot of money, yet to spend on yourself. If this turns out to be one and we're just doing psycho education we're not doing any of the psychotherapy part if it turns out that this has something to do. With you overworking your body relying so much on your body and not doing what you really want to do this is your opportunity this is your opportunity to do something for yourself. it's going to reinforce that you're important you're going to be less angry, to the resentful to the people around you. You might actually be in less pain you're going to be able to come back to Dr Gabriel and say. I actually tried to address the muscle tissue instead of throwing another medicine at it, which is something you just said, I don't want to put another medicine at something there's a lot of good things that can happen by doing this. $120 right now is a lot. But it's going to feel good, and I know for a fact that $120 you would go to the casino, and in an instant you would have no problem you'd have no problem blowing that. This won't be blown it is going to be the medicine that your muscles have been screaming and telling you attend to me you slamming it against a tire that's not treatment. You want it to go away. You just don't want to be bothered with it. Your body's trying to communicate with you. you've got some denial going on again we're doing psycho education here this isn't the elegant stuff it's kind of sneaky this is. I may have black lungs I don't want to think about it, I have muscles that have been giving me a hard time for years I don't want to feel it i'm going to going to numb it out. that's not working let's do something that's. The felt good you just said, a whole month there was relief that's an amazing investment."
341.0,Patient,"yeah it wasn't it was a great month because my body just felt so rejuvenated I felt great you know, like even like right afterwards, like. I had a few sore spots, but I just remember my body, just like moving and and everything just moving and another thing my sister told me that I might want to try as a chiropractor. because she says that I have a lot of pinched nerves and stuff and it could be, because i'm out of alignment, you know and everything is just pushing against each other, pushing my sadek and everything, and I have sat in on the real battle types, you know at least twice a year, you know."
105.0,Provider,"This is not my field, but I will tell you I have clients that complain, much of what you're describing and what they are educating me and what i'm hearing from them is. they're moving more there they're not sitting there doing more stretching and no they don't want to, but they are walking more and moving more they've changed the Chair that they're using and. they're addressing the psychology you know that has developed into this lifestyle and they're starting to feel relief. massage. Addressing the psychology okay you're doing this Bowling which is fantastic, the thing about chiropractic chiropractic adjustment. Again, I come from sort of a soft tissue perspective muscles are soft tissue right they hold the bones right where they are so if you go and you get that adjustment. That muscles if they're tight are going to probably pull it right back where it was so these two things typically go together, you get a chiropractic adjustment you want it to stay there, and not have that those muscles pull it right back to where it was so you want both. So either way massage is a good idea."
341.0,Patient,So the massage should either way come first.
105.0,Provider,"No, no, I can't speak to that all i'm going to say is if the soft tissue isn't. A dress addressed it's. likely, it will pull the bones back to misalignment. And if you talk to a chiropractor oftentimes they work with massage therapists there they have them in the same office because of what i'm talking about."
341.0,Patient,"I agree i'm going to try them massage because my uncle rigoletto used to go to this lady Leah like I think twice or three times a year and he's but he still does it to this day, and this was like when I first came now the perky and I was like 13 years old. He was doing this, and he still does it to this day and. If it wasn't working for him, or if it was a waste of money he wouldn't be doing it for this long and keep paying this lady to massage you know so. i'm uh. i'm thinking, I might be yeah I think that's probably my best bet and if it relieves whatever i'm going through, then I know, maybe I should get a massage like once a month or something. Because I didn't work a physical job and i've been doing it for 10 years great. yep my buys just telling me. he'll meal little bit."
105.0,Provider,I right. So let's talk.
341.0,Patient,A little bit more yeah.
105.0,Provider,"But what that does Anthony mean it's one thing to say that. But if it means you have to listen to your body more you know your your ability to use denial. that smoking is a great idea that putting caffeine, and not water is a great idea, you know we don't want to look at that you may not want to look at that denial is really convenient, because it means I don't have to feel shitty right now. I don't have to feel shitty I don't have to look at what i've done I don't have to think about regret ah. But. Maybe you're ready to do it, maybe you're ready to say, I want to make some changes because I want to live longer."
341.0,Patient,"Yes, I want to live longer. You know, doing better you know doing things that I enjoy, I just want to know, for the last I would even say 10 years you know i've been very unhappy. You know i've had some good days you know don't get me wrong, but I mean mostly it's not you know i'm just always overthinking things always thinking about. what's going to happen, the next day, when I could have had so much fun today, you know, and I blew off having fun today because i'm worried about tomorrow and so. Those are the things that i'm trying to get rid of is worrying so much being so stressed about things that. I can't even that aren't even here yeah you know, like five weeks from now I don't even know what's gonna happen five weeks from now Why am I so stressed about it, you know why, can I just live happy in the moment that I am now whether it's just sitting watching a TV. talking to my kid. Taking a walk taking her dog out for a walk and meeting some people on the walking trail, I mean that was fun, but I met a guy he had a dog to add is we started talking, and I mean two hours went by I don't even think I said one word. He was just. just talking about and stuff I didn't even understand what he was talking about. That I looked at the clock it's already getting dark i'm like damn I gotta get point and so as i'm walking like all right take it easy to start talking again about something and then we get stuck there for another five minutes. I don't know about that, but I do want to be able to socialize more. and talk to people, not at my shop, you know I want to. yeah me isn't people you know different new people that maybe have a Bowling interest to because think about a league as their singles leagues, but there's team needs also and, if I can get three other people that have the same interest we can start our own team, you know."

Now I I was a little bit scared you know I actually sat in my car and I was like man I don't even want to get down. So, but you know I left my Bowling ball and everything in the car and I just got out and within you know and just kind of looked around and stuff and. It just wasn't as scary is that. scary.

It just I don't know what that is is the weirdest thing i've ever heard of, I guess, but I just that's me. That is me, and I know for a fact that i'm scared to do these unscary things, but the scary things are not scared."
105.0,Provider,"So Anthony that's that's brain that's brain. we're so just just imagine this thing you just did bar brawl it's not like you, you go Oh, I am going to. Think about all the consequences if I could break my hand I could kill this guy and go to jail you're not using the prefrontal cortex all you're doing is the instinctual. Self preservation stuff when you have time to sit in the car and think about what if they think i'm an idiot What if i'm terrible or they think i'm stupid where they think i'm lazy or you have all that time right to think."
341.0,Patient,that's about all the stuff I even thought well scenario.
105.0,Provider,"If you're not alone they're thinking that to. This is your life, this is your life, you get up and you go, I want to find someone interesting orient yourself to I am looking for what interests me the second you start to go, how will they view me know. This is me shopping for interesting people, I want to notice when i'm having fun oh this guy this guy you're listening to him talk to you for two hours. Are you enjoying was there really an opportunity for you to go. We have gone out to share where you enjoying it were you paying attention to the fact that you may not have been enjoying it Maybe it was time to dip. You know, an hour and 20 minutes ago that's the orientation, you can get in the car and say Fuck it, this is me looking for a good time i'm shopping i'm assessing you all. Your interesting Where are you from how long you been coming as your first day it's kind of awkward weird or whatever what other. Other other meetup things going on to as the first time, whatever you've got some you've got a central thing to talk about, but this is for you to shop. you're interviewing them. You see it."
341.0,Patient,I do.
105.0,Provider,"And when you sit in the car and you go maybe go check out this site, or any of these other ones that are out there when you do that just realize. This is for you. This this has nothing to do with them they're just the way you do it at work, know what they're going through. You want to have a good time you have every right to have a good time to go find out this might not be it maybe these people this night are interesting maybe the next one there'll be funny though good jokes."
341.0,Patient,"yeah that's Another thing I need to keep in mind that, just because today wasn't that great the next time might be better you. Know 10. Days bad day to say oh next session is going to be just as bad or worse. So I gotta. keep that in mind too that's just like work, you know. Yesterday might have been so shitty at work, but the very next day, you know it's fun everybody's laughing having a good time, you know no stress. I agree, I do want to meet new people you know these my cousin Ray and then that's my cousin's friends, you know that they like to do things together, you know us. You know, we work together, whatever but come outside of work, I don't really have anything in common with these people, you know that's what I want to find people that I have things in common. And I just sad to see people out there that are so hard on themselves that you know they just sit at home, like. board and miserable crying in their bed, and I don't want to do that anymore, you know i'm tired of making myself feel bad putting myself down because of something that I think somebody else might be thinking of me no I don't want to put myself down anymore I you know, I believe that. i'm here to take care of my daughter. i'm a good person I treat people well. i'm fun. To be around and. I should just know that you know about myself when i'm around these people they're probably you know, like most of my customers and stuff they, like me, you know they, like me, we talk we laugh. You know I don't treat them bad like my cousin does you know I don't know why how you can own a business and get mad at a customer for coming to your business for business, you know it's. You know your tire shop they're coming to get their tire fixed, but then you get mad at them Oh, you know, like what the hell. So I always. Like the other day this lady was like is that the boss, and I was like yeah, of course, the that's the owner, he was like it is he always like that I said, ever since I can remember, yes."
105.0,Provider,doesn't make a.
341.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't know how you could treat people like that. So, even though i'm in a bad mood sometimes I work stuff i'm not really feeling like I always like to put a smile on and. You know, make them feel good, you know that way you know who wants to make people feel bad, especially when they're paying you money you know that's how I make my money my custom, you know my cousin doesn't pay me my his friends don't pay me. The work that I do for these people they pay me so as long as people keep coming to our shop tires repairs, or whatever i'm going to make money and if he's treating people bad they don't want to come over here, no more i'm losing out on Monday."
105.0,Provider,So.
341.0,Patient,"that'd be kind to people that's what I could try to tell him, you know and then he he talks bad like really bad about women all women. Oh, and. I have a 14 year old daughter about to turn 15 you know what I mean you're. you're pushing me to this man i'm trying to let him die i'm giving them like little it's like you're you're going a little too far, and you know you guys making fun of me. Together that's fine that's funny you know but talking about women real bad and like. Even like 18 year old girls, or even like even younger than that because they're 17 and saying these filthy things about them, you know almost like his top you're talking about my daughter also. On it gets me like you know, so I just I try to keep myself cool I breathe a lot now and I just let it be you know, because what they say about my daughter does not make what my daughter is you know. You know, so I gotta just keep remembering to not let people what people say and do affect my emotions."
105.0,Provider,"Excellent so Anthony a lot of actionable things were talked about today i'm just going to review some of them. Bringing 10 cigarettes to work, including people in this in this commitment. hide the rest of them i'm only going to budget myself with this many today. i'm using the fox stopping I can wait, I can wait 60 seconds go do something else and it'll turn in to an hour. going on to one of these these Apps just showing up and saying this is about me this is about whether I find someone interesting and even more so, this thing you do at work. Go make someone smile make someone laugh i'm here at this Bowling alley to give someone a giggle you know if I bump into someone i'll see if I can put a smile on their face give when you're doing that you're not preoccupied if someone's going to somehow be a threat to you. Those are actionable things that you can do. All right, let's meet in a couple weeks. That puts us at October 15 that sound okay and make a call to insurance to find out a little more information."
341.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"All right, well, I hope to hear that you. You remember those black lungs as a motivator."
341.0,Patient,Oh yeah I mean.
105.0,Provider,Think about it.
341.0,Patient,Now i'd probably be wanting to smoke a cigarette right after I get off this thing but i'm I don't even feel it right now.
105.0,Provider,"Good so scope don't give that a shot see what would happen if you just took took half only have to work left it in your car. Just picturing the yucky lungs and knowing that what your brain defaults to is not wanting to look at long term consequence. It will default to that because it does nobody wants to think about we don't want to lose right now we don't want to think about the future consequence we just don't like it our brain doesn't like it. But you can be smarter the mind can be smarter than the default brain all right, good luck to you."
341.0,Patient,By Anthony see a group.
105.0,Provider,good night.
