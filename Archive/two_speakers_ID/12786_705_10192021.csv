705.0,Provider,"hi Rosa. hi rose said, if you can hear me it looks like I can see. I can see that you don't have any sound just it looks like it's connecting to audio there we go. So connecting to audio I think you're on mute. And let's see if we can get your video. So i'm asking you and chat if you can hear me because right now Rosa you're on mute and your screen isn't your picture isn't showing just yet so video video isn't on just yet. could be Internet thing happening. You can't turn on your video or microphones let me see if I can i'm going to ask you to unmute. So I just sent to show your video BC show your video. Do you have an earphones let's see. Sometimes earphones that can help if your audio is not connecting. you're at home, but if you are do you want to try a different spot. Sometimes you make it a signal more in one place than another. You can also try leaving and then I can readmit you if all else fails. So still no video and no audio. If you want Rosa then try to end the meeting and then dial back in with the number. And that's going to be the 679-811-5777 i'm going to put it in the chat. In settings let's see. Sometimes, when you set up an audio when you first initiate the meeting it'll tell you to select which audio So if you have headsets it would have to say headsets so at this point, you could even try removing the headsets and maybe then the audio would work. let's see Rosa so it was cutting in and out. let's have you leave the meeting and come back. If you can hear me go ahead and leave the meeting and come back. If it's stuck to okay there it goes so hopefully patient will be able to return she's having difficulties so let's see if she's able to come back in. So waiting for patient to return. Okay, I see connected to audio and then it went away."
12786.0,Patient,It works.
705.0,Provider,Can you hear me I can I can hear you.
12786.0,Patient,There we go.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, you made it work What was your magic."
12786.0,Patient,I don't know my phone just decided to not allow me to connect it said that the host had disabled it. Both of them.
705.0,Provider,yeah and see from my end I was asking you to turn it on.
12786.0,Patient,yeah I was trying to every time it will pop up with a message saying I couldn't turn it on. i've never experienced that I was like i'm not sure.
705.0,Provider,"I know I haven't either, but you did the right thing, where sometimes it's leaving and then coming back. And were you able to sign back on with the link that I sent."
12786.0,Patient,"No, I did not see the link I ended up having a call the care navigation again. But we gave me the. number for this."
705.0,Provider,"Right. Just in case yes. And that number rosie usually doesn't doesn't change, so it anytime you could just put that number back if it's our time and as long as you're checking in with the virtual Center you could either do you know how you can text them to check in. And you have 679-811-5777."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's like. So whenever i'm having a session with you."
705.0,Provider,Yes.
12786.0,Patient,"Number two Okay, I was looking for it because i'm pretty sure last time you had given it to me, but I was like I can't find out me so the call."
705.0,Provider,"that's Okay, and I had reached out to them to in case you would call so i'm glad that they were able to assist you and get you that. But yeah it's again, you know so i'm glad you work that out so i'm very curious of how the heck you're doing and your afternoon you've been working at your new job."
12786.0,Patient,"Oh, I love it i'm today, I talked to the assistant manager and he didn't know about my previous work history. And he didn't know that I was technically a manager at my inventory company, and as soon as he said that he was like, why are you in this position, why are you in such a low position, I was like I didn't know how to respond to that like. Because what I I felt like I qualify for us i'm pretty sure, the reason I didn't really apply for anything else was because my high school or ged I don't have anything for that and then he asked me how I felt about being the second for the produce manager. And I was like I mean I i'm gonna try it, of course, I was like but I don't know my survey run the whole department very well yet. And he's like Okay, well, I also have to him, but after he talked to him, like he went right to the back room to talk to him, I never heard anything from either of them, but I did get a little bit. Of a weird feeling from the produce manager like he was. I don't know in different to idea is the best way I could describe it possibly but i'm I get the feeling that one of my co workers in my in my little department of the produce area because, for the fresh cut department I produce we like cut the fresh produce to put out for so. I felt I feel like he doesn't like me very well and I and i'm pretty sure that something he's been taking to the produce manager, but I don't do anything but. I don't I don't. I don't complain like they do that's, the only thing I could think of because all the other people, they just sit there the whole day and complain about what they have to do. And if I did, that that wouldn't be good for my health like so I sit there and i'm i'm positive I try and keep them positive, but I feel like they don't like."
705.0,Provider,"wow you know Rosa yeah it's challenging and especially where you don't want to engage in that like you said it's not good for your well being. know now. And so they it may be possible, where they're trying to be like well well okay so she's not engaging in this what is that about but it's like well it's about you, creating an inviting work atmosphere."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. And when I used to get to supervise I always like to make sure I kept my atmosphere with my mother I don't like say like. I guess boredom in it, so I don't know but. When I was working with others, I always try to keep them in on what's going on what they need to know or if they even have questions and and that's something you don't get it a lot of places and that's, the reason I like to do it that way."
705.0,Provider,"You mean open communication. So what a concept, I mean it's like. I know, sometimes it's like you look around and you're like Why are people not talking, why are we not working, this out you're absolutely right."
12786.0,Patient,"I mean, I know personally i'm not one to sit there and talk and talk and talk, but if it's if it's information that's vital. Until your job. It share it, you know, like. it's gonna help someone grow. sherry."
705.0,Provider,And if. That is it they're gonna have a problem with it's like.
12786.0,Patient,"yeah the. The assistant manager, I spoke to he said he actually liked my attitude, I have a really nice attitude and I was very shocking for me it's like. The last two jobs, I worked at they didn't seem to like my attitude and i'm pretty sure my manager didn't like that I was always sad but I was unhappy there. And i'm the previous one, I was just so constant, I just wanted to get things done, and it was kind of a fast environment fast paced environment so that would That was why. But I felt like I was, I was shocked that they liked my attitude, but, but you know those good."
705.0,Provider,Does that thing give you here's this other group of people that they're just disgruntled and they want you to join in and then here's your manager taking notice that. Like your attitude does that give you a little bit more security of like hey I can just be myself and be this positive person.
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, it did, and I felt like It made me even more positive today, after hearing that. Okay, so I do have a lease of decent attitude that's that's good to hear it's like someone appreciates it in a way."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely appreciate you and also to is it's nice to be like Oh, I like your attitude it's like encouraging. yeah meeting."
12786.0,Patient,True.
705.0,Provider,"At this point, to was it today, then he said about checking out about moving you up."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah it was all it'll happen today was actually the first time I was like. formally introduced with them uh he had said, good morning to me multiple times before, and I didn't really know him I was like. As one of the other co workers, I was like this guy keep saying good morning to me and knows my name, who is he she's like oh Okay, the assistant manager, I was like oh okay that makes sense."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. And at the end of the day, to it's just like so you're there you're doing your job and who's maybe feedback to you appreciate more."
12786.0,Patient,The probably the higher ups.
705.0,Provider,"Well, if they're the ones that yeah that are making like choices of where you may go, you know and moving up and to leadership roles it's like well you know i'm sorry i'm not going to allow myself to be dragged into drama i'm going to do my job and doing well when are some opportunities."
12786.0,Patient,"True, and I noticed that the my co workers in my department, they kind of like the flak on their duties and. I think it irritates them that i'm very. The best way I could describe is angel I make sure I try and do everything that i'm taught the way i'm supposed to do. And we working with food half the time. They sometimes some of them just skip cleaning the food, the fruit and veggies and it's just I feel like that's, the most important thing, because I don't want my name coming back to someone getting to lie or something."
705.0,Provider,or yes.
12786.0,Patient,"And I think the thing that bothered me the most about them is they got so angry because one lady she. She wanted she wanted to know if they could make her if they had any fresh pineapple made today. she's like well there's kind of what we made yesterday out on the floor. And she's like okay well do you have any fresh and the guy was in the back right then and there cutting it and I said that I was like well, we have he's making some of the back, right now, if you just wait a moment. And she was angry with me for saying that it's like this is the customer that pays your bills."
705.0,Provider,"You they take care of you, in the end, like you want them to be happy more customers means a better store, which means better pay for you. Right customer service isn't that, like the training, you probably received was about customer service."
12786.0,Patient,"Actually we didn't really get any training on customer service we did learn some other weird things like about making the price point even about equality in the workplace. And I think there was. There was one that irritated me because it was it was pointless because nobody's following it I can't think of it off i'll hand, though. But. it's it's, the most important thing it's, the reason I came to the stories, I was like oh they're going to be more about the customers, not in the back, they are not. That whole department, the whole produce department, I feel like they don't like to interact with the customers. And I don't understand why."
705.0,Provider,"It could be to Rosa that they're going to learn by your example and when you're engaging because you know as a customer that's what you want, if you if that's what's important to you."
12786.0,Patient,"They I feel like they don't understand what it's like to be. A customer like, do you not go to a store on something or have questions, because I know I do, and I want something the best as possible. And so what if they do too. it's not so terrible."
705.0,Provider,"You have the Russa, a lot of empathy and you're able to appreciate and I hear pride in your job, and what you're putting out there you don't mind working hard and putting you know you have pride. In your job and."
12786.0,Patient,"I didn't notice that, until recently, like how every time I go to a job it's I can't help it I if i'm working for a store that stores part of my home my family. And that's the way it should. Be that's the way they train you to be the king, the Community in the store and reach out to the Community, which are the customers. To make. A better community all around, including like your whole town and everything but. I didn't even notice so recently that I was like but."
705.0,Provider,"If you're like that and others aren't developed in those skills and talent. Is it then easier for you Rosa to take it back to like. i'm doing my job and i'm satisfied and can sleep at night because i'm doing my job. yeah does it any I mean I don't want to use the word easier because it's not easier because you're there with them for so long, but does it help at least the internal messages that may play if they lean more towards you having doubt about yourself."
12786.0,Patient,"And yeah the more and more, as I see it does. Because. I, I know that a lot of times i'll sit there and i'll get in my head and not overthink every little interaction with my co workers. But today I kind of I was like I don't I don't really care, because as long as i'm just taking care of myself and doing my job there's nothing they can do. there. You can't get mad if i'm just doing my job right they can't fire me so what what what is there to be worried about if they don't like that and positive so. What does that say about them, rather than me."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you exactly and i'm the way that you're sharing i'm thinking to they even the case where they feel threatened, because you do care you do, that your job and it's like they don't want to do their job and they're threatened because they're like oh no, you know I may have to work."
12786.0,Patient,"that's actually kind of what else i'm a little bit worried with with the produce manager cuz he's he's he's a good manager, but I know there's things she's not doing perfectly i'm not going to call them out on it. that's not my job. And it wouldn't be, even if I was a second. feel like he may be fit and because of the way he was acting i'm after a little bit after the interaction with the assistant manager, because this is manager headed straight back there to talk to him. I came back and i'm. really doing some things and so when we cut the food our trash we throw into a compost. And I wasn't completely trained All I know is they put it in the compost box out out out there. And i've put it in the accomplice box and yeah I was looking a little bit full but it wasn't overflowing so I dumped it in there. And then, one of the produce people comes by and pushes pushed it down a little bit and a little bit after that the manager called a little meeting between the fresh cut and the one produce clerk that was there, and he was like. He basically was saying it was our fault that it was overflowing and he can't get mad at other departments when we're the reason. out of nowhere, and now I was like I don't understand like I didn't even know about this, I wasn't trained about that at all. And he kind of just told me I don't know if it was because I had like this expression on my face because I felt shocked I was like oh. You know I didn't know that and i'm pretty sure this is about me now because what's on the top of piles for me, you know, and he gestured towards me. Like giving me the floor or accusing me of it i'm not sure what my response was I wasn't I wasn't aware and I didn't even know that. I wasn't even trained on how to replace it and break it down and move it, and all this stuff and he didn't he didn't really respond he just said Okay, and someone else offered to do it, and that was that. Honestly, if it was my fault, I would have liked him to be like hey now, you know how about I show you how or so and so will show you how. But that wasn't the case I ended up asking the other fresh cut with my coworker how to do it and she's like well since the. The person and produce was doing it i'll have them show you right now, and he did, and I was very open and. Now I know how to do that, but I had to do it all, on my own."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that's where again Rosa is I just hear, time and time again, your leadership qualities that you just they keep coming out because you do. You have integrity and you want to do it right, and you want to you know be trained in these areas and i'm glad that you did stand up for yourself and say hey I wasn't trained with this, because I mean you don't know what you don't know."
12786.0,Patient,"Exactly one of the other people He complains about the amount of training we all receive to he's like nobody's trained right, but I feel like that's everywhere we're so like. Everything has to be so fast paced nowadays that training gets left behind and forgotten, a lot of the time."
705.0,Provider,"yeah However, you did some problem solving where once it became you know you're aware in a you had attention of hey this is how we're supposed to do it, then you problem solved and you got someone to show you."
12786.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,They can initiative.
12786.0,Patient,"True true. I was um I was trying to take the most initiative as I could, at that point, because I felt like he was he had a little bit of. I don't know worry because of possible conversation, he may have just had with the assistant manager."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12786.0,Patient,"And so I was like let me at least put in my best effort. And I tried and, hopefully, he saw that or took note. in any way. But. I don't want to not get a position, just because. The fear of what I might bring to the table, you know. And I feel like it would be wrong, but. i'm giving it some time before I say anything because I don't want to I don't I don't want the position right now anyways I don't know."
705.0,Provider,If you would like to with your hard work and dedication. know that there will be some reward to that's deserving.
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely."
705.0,Provider,"yeah well you've only been there, a week."
12786.0,Patient,Two weeks a little bit over.
705.0,Provider,Two weeks and you've already been recognized by the system manager.
12786.0,Patient,True true little bit faster than the last story.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I like to how you're like you know what I don't I don't want the promotion just yet i'm going to i'm going to continue, and they can see my my actions and then be able to be like Okay, this is what she's all about."
12786.0,Patient,"I totally get the rest, or I may be pushed a little bit too hard to move up, so I, I want to give it some time but originally I entered that store thinking that I would be a little bit. I would be moving up faster because she the whole thing is, you have to start at the bottom to work your way up at that store, so the lowest level position and then she just kept me there and I was being treated badly. So I don't want that, but I also. came into this this new company with a little bit higher position he he asked me my pay rate and he said I was almost maxed out for. Where i'm at right now. So that's good."
705.0,Provider,"huh. yeah so that tells me when i'm hearing that rose said that already they're looking at that you're worth it, and they wanted to pay you the most that they could. And then, in addition, they have you know they're looking at that that could be the potential for you to to to move up but i'm really. proud of, where you looked at such a toxic situation and you got yourself out of it and you learned a lot about who you are and what you're willing to put up with."
12786.0,Patient,"True. I think I feel a lot better after today i've noticed like. I don't know I just feel a little bit more positive that I noticed. I could just push it all away all the the the the toxicity around me, you know. And so, for okay with myself as long as I keep that positive outlook. It was actually at the end of the day, I was told the manager the produce manager he came in and told me that he was leaving I didn't understand why he's never told me that he's leaving. And it's not his place to tell anybody that is leaving I was wondering if he was giving me a little bit of a. Like a bit of power, so that I know hey like he knows hey i'm not here, so now, you know it's in your hands, if you want, you know but. When he is he was like i'm out of here, I was like Okay, you have a good rest of your day Jose and he's like i'll try very negative and down, I was like well if you stay positive about it, maybe you'll have a better day."
705.0,Provider,yeah maybe you'll attract that right.
12786.0,Patient,This one.
705.0,Provider,"yeah if you change your focus, maybe you won't okay so. wow it takes some people more time, or sometimes people just they they. Are in that place where that feels good to them if they wanted, you know to be negative and to dig their self maybe it's they feel deserving you know, like this is where I need to be a whole host of things."
12786.0,Patient,I understand that completely i've been there.
705.0,Provider,you've developed though a coping skill or you're more realistic and able to pull yourself back and be like well wait a minute.
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, I just got to keep it up."
705.0,Provider,"Well, keep it up and it's okay to that there may be days that you feel down and being able to feel those feelings and you're going to manage through."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, especially with my bipolar disorder."
705.0,Provider,"With with that then yeah it's like knowing yourself where it's just like Okay, I can learn to identify if i'm if i'm shifting I can learn to that some medications i'm going to respond to more than others, different coping strategies might serve you better at different times."
12786.0,Patient,just learning the situations and how to. go about dealing with them yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Exactly. And to know to that a lot of what we talked about like with kinda to behavior it sounds in the moment so like oh you've replaced this and you counter and it sounds really like. almost like we're trying to make it so easy but it's not is it takes practice and it takes time and it's not easy, and I want to just say that because giving credit to. your dedication to keep trying it and to turn things into more positive or to turn things in where even if it's not positive it's like I can handle whatever you throw at me, I will it might not be all Nice and pretty and like box stuff for you, but i'm going to handle it."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, true. it's kind of reminds me of the other day I kind of just got thrown into doing something that I shouldn't have had to at all, because I had to come in earlier to do this thing because. The person who's like the head of my area his name is brandon brandon decided, he was going to take the day off and switch today with someone else who doesn't know how to do what he knows how to do. And we have to have the inventory done and checked and then we have to have a production report for the day printed out every day, and he wasn't going to be there to do it, I barely was trained in it and so he's like hey you can do it right, I was like I can show. But the part that bothers me is he was like you might have to come in an hour earlier. I did it, but if it happens again and I have to bring it up to management, because that's not cool to just pass on someone, especially if they have other things in their life going on."
705.0,Provider,Did you want the extra hour.
12786.0,Patient,"not really I had to wake up early. I could do it. It wasn't like I couldn't because of school or anything so I was like i'll try i'll come in as early as I can, and I did I came in almost an hour early I was a little bit less, but I did. yeah and I felt pretty proud of myself, because I actually did it in handled it. pretty good, I think."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you know I heard to where you said, I will, I will try and you know, like i'll do my best, but there's no like permanent like i'm not saying two hours before time that you gave yourself that flexibility."
12786.0,Patient,yeah and it did help me so that I I knew I wasn't so pressured. yeah that's a big thing for me if I feel a little pressured I get get anxious and.
705.0,Provider,And then you pulled it off.
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, true."
705.0,Provider,What one more of those unknowns that you picked up rather quickly and then it builds your confidence at work.
12786.0,Patient,"True, it definitely did I feel more comfortable in the store."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12786.0,Patient,"Even though I might not be as. As welcome as I wish I would, but I feel comfortable and making it my own home, you know."
705.0,Provider,"And if you're able to build on that being comfortable and to more than comfort, you know, like, I feel like i'm really this week, you know or this month, this is my goal and i'm already getting there."
12786.0,Patient,"I didn't really come into this place expecting much out of it, I even. Planned if I wanted to go to another job I even got a recommendation for it, so I wasn't like too invested, so I think that also helped me. know I had other options and. Because I was something I know I talked about with you that I was scared I was gonna run out of options and that's why I figured out another option, just in case. yeah and it probably helped me a little bit so that I didn't feel like this is all I had. I still. cuz There are still other options out there and anytime."
705.0,Provider,"that's taking it, though, and not right there Rosa is cvt or you take it, and where instead of feeling like this is it, this is my only option you expanded it."
12786.0,Patient,True.
705.0,Provider,"expanded it took it took a look, you know, made it where your perception now isn't trapped your perception opened into hey I have options, I can feel better about this."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah definitely did. Like looking at the bigger. bigger picture, rather than just one little fat."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's easy, though, to fall, sometimes in that rut where we feel trapped in our jobs, who feel trapped in relationships we may feel trapped in you know, and we can just fill in the blank."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah definitely I know i've had a lot of that in my life. I think I let my get self get trapped at my inventory job, but in I did, like the actual job, a lot like. almost like an addiction. I just. I like to just zone out and do math and I think now, I know, like with schooling i'm thinking, I could find a job, where i'm doing a lot more math or maybe i'll just go to school and take a bunch of classes and move up in my current job. And because I do a little bit of math and if I keep moving up like it'll be come more and more important to the job."
705.0,Provider,yeah and you were saying to is it that you're starting now i'm school.
12786.0,Patient,"Oh. yeah well today i'm going to go talk to the counselor for the second time and give her my response, but last week, I think it was. I ended up taking a pre ged test, and then I got a really good score and my I talked to my teacher about and she was like take your test take your test right now I was trying to tell her I want a better score because I found out behind I get. If I get like a really, really high score I could get college credit for it on the test, I was like that be helpful. But she's we don't even worry about that just take it, and I could take it in the retake it to hire my score that's always a possibility. But I really wasn't thinking about that at the time. And so I had some objections time I stopped by the counselor's office and finally got a chance to talk to her, I was interested in getting him an IEP for my reading so that I could work, one on one with someone and found out but I can't because i'm 20 over 22 unless I have like. A doctor's excuse or something I can't get it, and I was pretty disappointed, because I feel I need like a lot of help and my reading. But she did say that if I wanted, I could do the high school diploma Program. and continue to do my ged prep classes with my teacher because i'm comfortable there. and I had asked her if I could do that, and she was like. yeah that's something we could definitely work out it just be a little bit special and different than other students and I was like that's fine she's like can you'd have to contact your other teachers well. And I told her, I wanted to keep in the class, because I do feel like it's helping me. Even though it's not as much as I wanted. it's it's helping me remember what I did in high school and improve my writing skills, because the teacher, I have she's. she's mainly a language arts teacher for middle school students and then she does the ged program at night so she's a little bit more focused on your reading rather than anything else, so that's kind of helpful for me it's kind of what I need. doesn't think that that up either I guess that's good."
705.0,Provider,And you know what's Nice is you get to choose what you're comfortable with and again where you're you're exploring here's your options and then you're choosing what meets your needs.
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely. Rather than letting myself get. trapped in a box anymore."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's like well great so so you're reading she's sharing with you is already up at a higher level, but if you feel comfortable and you know what this teacher and what you're going to do and that's the best solution for you right now."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah. it's the only one, so far that i've came across that I think would be the best."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. it's always to where sometimes things at the time, this is this is decision making, where you're like okay i'm going to decide, but there's also to that he may come a time that you want to maybe adjust and find out if there's room for adjustments."
12786.0,Patient,"True. um i'm thinking that next year, might be different if i'm still in the program so that'll be a definite time that i'll have to adjust. A readjust at least. The good news is my teacher i'm pretty sure she comes back every year, so far, she kept saying about retiring but she's like I can't do that I still got college loans out."
705.0,Provider,"yeah wow that's good to hear that again even even now, you talked about work and someone's recognizes us even in your education you're being recognized and they're like hey wait a minute here's this other avenue, what do you think about this."
12786.0,Patient,"So it feels pretty good to finally get the recognition, I think, especially at work, because last job was just awful and I put a lot of sweat into it."
705.0,Provider,yeah it's unfortunate Rosa that you had to put up with that toxic work environment.
12786.0,Patient,"But I am glad i'm out of it that's all the vendors, I am still dealing with a lot of the. The stuff from it, though, because I got like Union letter and then a letter of termination from them, which I was confused about considering I resigned. So I was just worried that that was going to go on my record and i'm been trying to talk to my Union REP but he's not answering so I was then just reaching out through text because I assume he's pretty busy. But I haven't been getting responses and then today I got something about how they're not going to be representing me for food Max anymore, but I think it's, the Union is no longer representing food Max people i'm not sure. But i'm going to continue to try reach out to him and figure this out. Anything even if he's not presenting me he should allow me to know that. Eventually, whenever I remember."
705.0,Provider,Right right and like you're saying to that it wasn't appropriate to receive a termination letter because that's not what happened so whether i'm with you or not right now fix the issue. yeah right.
12786.0,Patient,"yeah cuz that letter of termination I believe it was set before he had to stop representing me, so I feel like maybe he might be more obligated to but. i'm not sure."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it sounds like again Rosa that you're exploring you're finding out what are your options and that it's worth your time and effort. Mental health wise, then so you have you know the different stuff with education happening and then with work life house mental health life."
12786.0,Patient,"Well today's definitely been a good game day i'm. Nothing too bad recently. Oh actually. Yesterday, some one man and Lee messages me about my fiance. And says. They piece on dating websites and. Basically, telling me well yeah they said he's on dating websites they sent me pictures of their chat with him, but it was this them sending him dirty pictures. And I managed to handle it pretty well and in the end, or pretty decently i'll say recently was a little too much, I mean I snapped at my fiance but cuz I was. heated up, but in the end they kind of saw that it was more them it wasn't my fiance he showed me they messaged me at 5am and then sent him pictures of and then took a picture of that and sent it to me. So I can see there that it was just someone trying to start something where it didn't need to be and normally I would have been a mess over that especially that because I have a lot of trust issues when it comes to my fiance, and I mean they're not gone, but. I was surprised that I handled it so well cuz I managed to stay out work normally I would have been like I have to leave i'm to distress, but I worked through it, I got like. shaky and nauseous but I pushed through it, because my job was more important than the drama, they were starting. A new I didn't even see it at the time."
705.0,Provider,"and good for you, for figuring it out and then like no this doesn't make sense, and you know learning from that experience to to sometimes people want to create chaos."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely and in a way, I kind of wanted to because I originally I was like yeah if he's cheating on me talking to you send me the proof of him messaging you. And they didn't really say anything about that, but they had a lot of other things to say. And I after the conversation I kind of wanted to message him and yell at them for starting stuff but also like, no, no, no. Like I try to i'm trying to look at the wave like the wife, the way of Buddhist would and not create conflict where there should be because putting that negative energy out there it's going to come back to me. Yes, and it's and it helped me not. argue with them, and I think it was good for me to not make more. make more. I guess stress for myself, and so I i'm pretty proud that I didn't do that. yeah because I probably be here, stressed out about it today if had it."
705.0,Provider,"The value to having a reaction versus a response you responded by finding out remaining calm doing you know pushing through work prioritizing work was more important where. Sometimes people are fishing for that reaction and if you get that reaction, then it gives them more motivation, where you're like no. i'm going to respond i'm going to be able to sort this out and again Rosa you are really taking a look at like I love how you're talking about that Buddhist you know of avoiding not avoiding content complex but choosing what you want to invite or not."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah i've been i've been trying to find a religion, I believe in because faith, they just I always thought like Oh, they have it all figured out. They don't but it's guiding them through life and I needed something to guide me and i'm glad that the noticing Buddhism it's helped me, even if it's just small little bits of it because i'm not like. i'm not one of those people who's researching and constantly. Go going to my church or anything but it helped me. In a little bit. More than I probably know right now in long term."
705.0,Provider,It can be very grounding to have something like that is definitely a strength for you.
12786.0,Patient,"Yes. Hopefully, hopefully. it'll help. Give me any bad times that I have coming, especially in the job and kind of worried about that."
705.0,Provider,"It is, and you know with your belief system to is you can explore and you can take what you want, from different types of spirituality and apply it back to what feels like it's right for you."
12786.0,Patient,yeah true.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so creating creating your own and and so you know, again, this is really good to help and like you said when you need it, you have something to draw on."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah and in, and I know that faith or religion it hope in those really bad times when you're. In a really bad spot mentally physically whatever. I know that out of had it I used to always just automatically talk to God, when I was in a really bad place but it wasn't something I believed in at all I can't. I can't explain why but it's just it wasn't and it also it so it didn't help as much it wasn't quite hitting the mark, and I think having something that I can actually. believe in a little bit more is helping definitely."
705.0,Provider,"And like you said hitting the mark that's so important where it's like yeah it resonates with me, because I believe in it, and I feel it."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely."
705.0,Provider,"Now, since some of the things have changed, you know and you're going through this job change and taking on with the education is there, you know I check in each time with any types of running thoughts have any self harm."
12786.0,Patient,"And not not for a while actually. I don't even think i've been in that place for a while, I know, yesterday I was very depressed that it didn't come across my mind to harm myself like I didn't want anything that happened to myself, like that I just I wish it wasn't happening. But I could change that. So I embraced it as best I could."
705.0,Provider,"And you did. And it didn't get to the point where, then you had male thinking. And that is progress."
12786.0,Patient,"Definitely. I didn't even think about that, until just know because normally in a situation like that I would have spiraled downward so hard so fast."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. So many changes that you're making like just that alone is is huge and then also where you know with the work and then with your relationship we're like normally I would have been distressed and had to leave work, but that didn't have to happen, you took control over it."
12786.0,Patient,yeah I didn't really think about it like that yeah definitely.
705.0,Provider,"that's a challenging Rosa when someone presents you with what they want to make into your situation, with a significant other and to be able to put that on the back burner still be able to work and manage it takes a lot of skill."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, skills that I developed find."
705.0,Provider,"These are things again through our experiences now you have different experiences that you can draw on and go well you know what okay. This is what I learned out of that or, this is what i'm going to do, because it's worked for me before."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah I still like before kind of would just shut down and that's what I did so that's what I did again and again and again, because I suppose what I was comfortable with. and there's a difference between shutting down and just putting it on the back burner like he said and that's not something i've learned until recently. just deal with it at your own pace."
705.0,Provider,Exactly and that's empowering.
12786.0,Patient,yeah it kinda is.
705.0,Provider,"yeah because it puts it back in your control where you're like you know what okay that came at me but guess what i'm going to deal with it, when I choose to."
12786.0,Patient,In my own way.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm Rosa style.
12786.0,Patient,Exactly.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it goes back to that belief, you were talking about that if you believe in what you're doing it's going to work even better and trusting in yourself that's where that comes to play to that you trust that hey I can get this whenever it is comes my way I will manage."
12786.0,Patient,"I never really ever thought that I would ever be in a place like that, but I could handle. Tough situations when they are thrown at me cuz I feel like I was the person who just instantly shut down turn myself off. and go to sleep and forget the world. So it's definitely nice to be here now."
705.0,Provider,"And this doesn't mean that if you know, sometimes we have those days, where life is challenging and multiple things come at us. And still within that moment, is knowing you can still manage it, and that might look different it's reaching out to people it's being able to just you know when you can to take a break, to be able to be like Okay, I need a minute."
12786.0,Patient,True.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12786.0,Patient,The constant learning process.
705.0,Provider,"Is it's also on that other end it's like yes you've learned so much, but if you can get joy out of that that to have reflecting back of just like dang i'm done this."
12786.0,Patient,"Definitely this true but uh. I always have a problem, like see the things of accomplish in I don't know what it is i'm sure lots and lots of people are like that it's just hard to see your accomplishments sometimes because you're looking through your own eyes. And you only see what you want."
705.0,Provider,yeah and and a lot of times it's the mistakes and when it's the negative things that we either take in and absorb or we hear other people say things and we just take one piece of it and internalize.
12786.0,Patient,It yeah I did that.
705.0,Provider,is being able to be honest and take a look and start to be like hey wait a minute okay so i'm going to digest this and maybe this part really doesn't match up with it and i'm going to choose that. that's your opinion that's your interpretation.
12786.0,Patient,"The everybody's got their own thing going on they've got their own mindset. it's it's it's kind of back to what I said before, assume nothing. Because if you're taking it a certain way you're assuming."
705.0,Provider,Exactly. Well i'm glad to hear that you know all these different things like you said that you're learning from it and that you're getting a greater sense of yourself.
12786.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,"That hard for you to get praise. to receive ready. I could see that and it's like it is you know, and it can be something that takes some used to getting you know take some time to get comfortable live meant to be like yeah I deserve to have praise and I deserve to have people acknowledge my accomplishments and the things that I do."
12786.0,Patient,yeah I think. For for the better.
705.0,Provider,I even just be able just to tolerate that's already in.
12786.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I know, to someone had told me a long time ago, when I started counseling and they said, you know just work on if you have a hard time with price just work on saying thank you. And, and especially like if someone brings you something, and you want to say oh you shouldn't have, or at least that's what I learned, you know in my family and so really replacing it with just like almost biting the Tongue, thank you, and then it becomes more natural."
12786.0,Patient,Okay yeah I have to try that.
705.0,Provider,It is a no Rosa this way I love with counseling and stuff like i'm a work in progress and it's just like you know every day I learned something new. Sometimes you know some days or maybe if we're gonna you know more balance some days not and it's finding out evaluating and managing and each day. yep.
12786.0,Patient,getting through it and learning the lessons that it has to teach.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is, is that whole thing of getting back out there, and you know going for one more here like that invited me down and my staying down and backup."
12786.0,Patient,True.
705.0,Provider,uh huh. Do you want to also I don't think I see another individual scheduled did you want to go ahead and schedule.

705.0,Provider,So.
12786.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"If you like, then, again on November 2 I have everything from 2:30am until six so that means I could do 230 I could do three 334 30 anything like that four o'clock 435 o'clock."
12786.0,Patient,"Six, and that was. On a second."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it would be November, the second or I can check another day."

12786.0,Patient,At 330. minutes later.
705.0,Provider,You got it like I said on that day it's a little bit more open so 330 at that matches or even for if that's better.
12786.0,Patient,"I think they should work, I just want to make sure I have enough time to pick my son up from school."
705.0,Provider,"yeah three three is so i'm going to go ahead and make that happen for 330 and let me just get your name here. And since you don't know your schedule, do you want to do that one and then we'll we'll schedule the second one, because we do twice a month."
12786.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,So I get added in here. we're going to November second and we said 330.
12786.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,"And just looking forward to save and close. Great so, then that will be at 330 on November, the second and you already did where you were able to put it in your phone or however you keep your schedule."
12786.0,Patient,My schedule my phone.
705.0,Provider,"Are the group still working for you, for the weekly groups. Yes, okay."
12786.0,Patient,"i'm probably going to have that, as my permanent day off now because of it, but it works out perfect."
705.0,Provider,"Our problem with it for right now to I have you. Why, you were trying to figure out your work schedule to I have you on a monthly for groups so that means at least come one time, a month, but you can come more and you don't have to do, like a scheduling or anything you just come, and then we give you, you know that you attend it. Because you. Know yeah. That way, if your schedule, all of a sudden changes for you, it gives you some flexibility where okay I can't make this one, but at least one time, but I would encourage if you can reduce it to come every every week, if you can."
12786.0,Patient,Okay i'll probably try for that.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, good good good good, so what is one thing that you would like to focus on until we meet again on November."
12786.0,Patient,"Keeping my positivity that I have now. at work at school and the way I face life, I guess, hopefully. yeah it doesn't want to lose that."
705.0,Provider,yeah so with the positivity I think that that's a great goal and something to focus on. feel free to explore like different ways to bring that positivity that joy into your life.
12786.0,Patient,"Yes. Then, my new thing is to try and respond to people's negativity with positivity. Like. it's it's fun, in a way."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, it is, and you said it right to where it's the responding it's like no i'm not going to react i'm going to respond with this interpretation of my. and see where they go with it, they might be like ah. It is definitely then it's it's theirs to choose what they want to do with it, but more importantly you're sharing those words and you're going to feel good about the energy you're putting out yeah."
12786.0,Patient,"And, if anything, maybe i'll even make them a little bit more positive."
705.0,Provider,"It definitely can be, and maybe some of your colleagues, that would be like Oh, you know they start doing it too and they're like oh domino effect."
12786.0,Patient,"Yes, that'd be nice."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and I know to the last time we talked one of the things you wanted to focus on is anger management, and so I had seen that, and you worked on that that was a perfect example about where you got the misinformation and what they presented it like."
12786.0,Patient,"yeah it was that's true. I guess, I guess, I did achieve a little boy."
705.0,Provider,I am that isn't a pretty extreme provoking event that could trigger some anger there. And you manage.
12786.0,Patient,Just a little bump I did yell at my fiance but. Oh.
705.0,Provider,"yeah again it's those steps, where, in the past, maybe want to look much different and then after you yelled was there a time that you could go back and talk about it, yes."
12786.0,Patient,"As soon as. A pretty much as soon as I was done yelling. The call ended and that we just started texting and talking and talking so that was good, it was progress."
705.0,Provider,"And if he if you were to ask him if tables return, what if he maybe he responded and embraces voice to about the situation."
12786.0,Patient,"He I know he was we've been together for seven years, I know. passes even even louder."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's nice to have that understanding and where you can allow yourself, I mean that was a valid reason to be angry at what happened and be able to have, though, the support system where the two of you worked it out. Well, good so now, for the rest of the evening, do you have a little bit of time to just relax and disconnect and enjoy the night."
12786.0,Patient,"No, I gotta go to school in an hour. But that's enjoyable in its own as to talk to the counselor and tell her that I want to do the high school diploma so."
705.0,Provider,Great.
12786.0,Patient,I get to do that.
705.0,Provider,"And you flip that you flipped it really quick into I heard you catch yourself where you're like yo I have to go to school and you flipped it and you're like, however, I like school Nice."
12786.0,Patient,True.

12786.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you. Hopefully, I hit rub off on my co workers."
705.0,Provider,"You can, and I know even with myself roses just hearing you talk and the way that you're able to put a different way to think about it, even for me when I hear that it's like wow that is refreshing to hear where you're like no I like it it's an opportunity."
12786.0,Patient,Good. Thank you.
