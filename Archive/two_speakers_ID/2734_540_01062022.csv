2734.0,Patient,"This carpet, has seen better days. I put a carpet in my basement floor and literally like it is like the worst foundation you've ever seen your life but boy. I put it down because of that reason I didn't want to live upstairs because I lived upstairs I would have lived right next to my mom. And both are very live up there and. Oh cool. And I was in a relationship anyways and you know I didn't want to have to you know it's just weird you cuz I mean her rooms like right next to where I would be it's right next to during don't know how they do it, I mean I would never bring a girl home yeah no. weird yeah um yeah. I had a problem man I don't know what the hell Okay, so I got my new phone up and running, obviously that's what I had switched yesterday when I said I wanted to switch to phone because the other phone I have, I mean it like dies I got I mean it's like. My superficial i'm sure everybody's got one a superficial taped up phone you know you got all the tape to try to hold together, and you know. So I got my new phone, so I switched the new phone to zoom account, and now you can't be logon to biases at one time. So they get before the last update I got. You was able to login to zoom still you know, under your account and be on another device still logged into so I could be on care now and still talk to you, you know I mean or in group setting I was able to be on group and talk to. Karen have to find out anything I need to find out when I you can't do that now they completely took it out to where you can only be logged into one device and one device only and it happens every freaking time that. I love this device, you would think if my information would carry over the like Karen Abba link and you know no so he literally I had this I had to open up that phone get the care NAB number and write it down, just to be able to. See you so i'm gonna i'm getting on my laptop to get the all my gmail theater links i'm sure I got the numbers in my you know gmail. But yeah it sucks every time a zoom updates or anything on any of my devices it automatically deletes all my information, like the history, like. Like I don't even have Dr Isaias group, you know or any of those a the other ones i've had they're all deleted the only thing I got right now is care now. And I don't know if they'll even say don't think it even want to save yours is take care now because I uic don't care enough I don't understand that. And to be when you logged in to zoom it was a. Just a. It would it would come up and just go into join a meeting or whatever, now it goes in to my browser. So I don't know if it's something that i've done or but it might have been doing it too, so I don't make no sense now goes into the browser mode, you know I mean my browser mode. So I want to use Google, or if I want to use being or if I want you know, to launch the zoom it used to be zoom was just its own thing, where we just launched, you know but it's not knowing. It literally my browser settings and it takes a longer period of time, because you know you got to answer you want to do this always or just wants. And after you do that, then it pulls it says, Google leads mike's a chrome so good, the Google leads, and then you have to tap in would like to sign in and it's crazy. You know I shouldn't have it."
540.0,Provider,There must be like an it that you can talk to about trying to resolve some of us.
2734.0,Patient,"yeah well you know I I was thinking, it must be this new phone that's what i'm saying is a I thought it would just new phone but it my other phones are doing it too now. And they've had the zoom Apps on them forever and i've never had a problem or i'd Logan zoom in automatically you know zoom APP would take me to you know where I need to go. to sign in or anything I would just have to go but yeah it's not doing that no more now it's actually literally once you launch and i'm like okay what that one second. yeah like literally it takes some just. wants to go to. The search engine, you know I mean on all my devices. it's always at it so it'll make more sense. Though."
540.0,Provider,"And that's android right, you said."
2734.0,Patient,"yeah you probably when I was thinking you probably got like the business card or the actual you know, like a."
540.0,Provider,"yeah and that's. Just because we, we have to have it for like the business portion so ours looks different than yours, a little bit."
2734.0,Patient,"But that's what I was trying to figure out because I don't understand how mine is. A we asked you come sorry I missed questions when you're logged into your zoom is it good to your browser settings first, or does it go to your zoom APP. I could mind make me sign in and everything now all my devices know it just goes directly into zoom Okay, well, I can just mine is just mind right. For some reason I must I must have put some kind of a block maybe with my chrome that's probably what is probably in my chrome browser settings you film, because all minor linkedin chrome so."
540.0,Provider,"i'm Sorry, I think that my supervisors calling do you mind if I just grabbed."
2734.0,Patient,"Music and clean up this thing of ice cream instead of letting it sit. don't bring it down right now, but you know joining my meeting, but it would have been nice to have it."
540.0,Provider,Alright sorry.
2734.0,Patient,"Oh you're fine. good enough little just a. My cat decided, while I was waiting to I was talking to Karen and my cat decided just. jump up here and I sit down, and he jumped literally over on my table which never gets on the table ever he literally, not a thing of ice cream I had just made a reading for to. I, like my noted like we're kind of like a frosty type you know. I, like my stream heart. melt yeah he decided that he wanted to look it up themselves so. don't you. So what's on the agenda what's going on."
540.0,Provider,So I guess it's more of I know we saw each other and not too long ago um is there anything that you wanted to talk about today.
2734.0,Patient,"Oh yeah Oh yes, I got I gotta start remembering this stuff like I always think about it when i'm i'm like you know in thought process when i'm on like repair nav or a compliance. Okay um so I was talking to a person Group when I came to bright heart, I didn't I really didn't get any explanation of what the expectation was or you know. Like I said Oh, I was in detox they probably told me, but you know, I was detoxing answer time so like everything they told me over telephone like you know, obviously i'm not going to remember, hardly any of the conversation, you know, he said what I wrote down on the data, you know. Logging in or calling to make sure I get in because they said, you know, once you get out because I had a bridge and then. The day I got out, I was pushed call and make sure I set up right away, otherwise you know they would call it a canceled whatever because you know I guess people do have time to go and detox and they say they're gonna do something they don't I mean i've done it not gonna lie. i'm like yeah i'm going to treatment and so they gave me, you know the number to call and I called. And went through the process of signing the paperwork to get you know joined up with bright heart, but when when I got here. Nobody all they did was give me a you know they obviously got me the zoom APP I had to go Google play you know download it and everything and then it had me type in. The number for care naveen and and I would I seem to do you know what two people I think two or three people. You know, have Karen APP to you know confirm that the zoom APP is there and it's working you know la la so then after I got signed up the name, you know said okay here's the you know, give me a link number to type in and said on this day, you know you need to. A first I first actually was a my first thing was a senior doctor I think right that's, the first thing you see a doctor. So I have natalie, obviously, but now he's not natalie not there anymore, so I see natalie for my first one on one and I don't know like. A I don't know, maybe because I can't think of anything that you really told me that would have made be known that you know I would have had."
540.0,Provider,Maybe just to go over what the program entails.
2734.0,Patient,"No, no, no i'm i'm pretty much. Now i'm pretty much an understanding. Of what i'm so when it's all started I didn't even know that you know, I was supposed to have two one on ones with therapists a month right, and then I didn't know down with the habit is it what is it like to see a doctor once a month or. Or what is that."
540.0,Provider,"So, usually it's once a month for the doctor and it's also like dependent on I know that we are going to be looking at trying to see like your eligibility for every other week. Which if you wanted, we can do, once a month counseling if you feel like that is something that you'd prefer like once a month or. that's up to you, but I know we're evaluating the every other week for group for you."
2734.0,Patient,know I want more Group and don't take it away.
540.0,Provider,"So so that's The thing is, so how the system works is you do good in treatment and as you're stable, you can come every other week, some people come monthly some people come quarterly. But it doesn't mean So if you were ever placed on it every two weeks thing that's more like script wise I have people that still come to groups weekly. and get like two weeks scripts. And, or even monthly scripts and they still come weekly so a. lot of that is just more of like the. script versus like. Saying that you would have to do. Like you don't have to not do. Groups weekly."
2734.0,Patient,"Well dude so am I supposed to have a one on one with Dr once a month, is what I was asking."
540.0,Provider,So yeah so once a month.
2734.0,Patient,So it is.
540.0,Provider,But it's the attention. On your so that's why you have to everyone's different so the doctor form of that you just have to talk with Dr and establish. That witchdoctors stuff like we do with the individual so like you and I see each other twice a month that doesn't mean that someone else needs me twice a month because we we make that plan. If that makes sense.
2734.0,Patient,"Okay yeah so see no one, no one explained to me that's me so that's what this, so this is kind of what happened, let me give you a run through so. i'm with Dr natalie I get on and i'm doing you know I know that should be their weekly for these things login for group. And you know they don't really you know we do like a quick, you know, a review of how is everybody week but knowing that nothing was ever said hey you're supposed to do this and you proceed up okay. So, finally, when it does come time you know I started getting messages thing was easy it was to me I didn't even know how to work stream, so you know I didn't know you could chat on here and that. So it's weird it was weird because I guess they had sent me messages saying hey I need to. make my appointments that I haven't you know and now i've been missing my appointments and stuff and i'm like i'm like missing a plan, you know how am I missing any appointments so. Finally, when I you know found out that you know just have a two appointments a month with a counselor you know and then uh, you know as needed with Dr really that's what they told me as needed but you know a lot of people say once a month. I was like Oh well, she knows, now known three months into the program before I even any notice, so you know now knows that they started and I started getting what is it called the red the red or mark the red."
540.0,Provider,flag and.
2734.0,Patient,"Then they started to sort of bridge script. And that that's that that's irritating because you know they give you four days and every four days I had to go back into kroger and get 40 pills. And you know. Already I ain't got a view for it now, you know, a third wrote down, but you know at that time my car my car was still broke down to you know just drive back for it gets here thing you know, and so, but did natalie. Finally, we got everything taken care of got everything sorted out and right when I got everything sorted out a natalie is leading. Product, you know I just got my appointments with her in London, I had cheryl so natalie was leaving and then you know they asked, we had to pick a date for you know, a new doctor knows your choice of a Wednesday or Thursday Thursday, so you know always I want with it so. What was it Tuesday or Tuesday to Thursday, I think it was Tuesday right yeah it was amazing group."
540.0,Provider,yeah um I think Monday Monday was our group. yeah yeah.
2734.0,Patient,"So when I got to Dr Isaiah I OK, I had a right before natalie left a day did a pre also me. The pharmacy or the insurance or whatever it is, where you know i'm a they couldn't feel my pills until I had some kind of a pre authorization thing because I was getting two and a half, you know, a day and they're. The. The only way to not get a free office they. only get two and then you still have to do one yearly, but if you get two and a half or more, they make you do it every 90 days or six months or whatever it is, so I was like holy shit so literally I had to go like literally I really if you wouldn't have been for a little. bit of help and people, you know I knew to help me. I would have been really screwed because I went three whole days without like real getting up getting the attention that you just you know I mean so three old days I didn't have any kind of pills. So I was like you know so then. I got that taken care of and you know me natalie I talked about that you know, because you know, three days they're united and have any scripts and I told her you know, like. I was like or well, I mean I had, I had a people helped me one till day you know, to take the edge off, but. You know when you're doing a two and a half day, and you know sudden you trying to do. You know, and it didn't hit me to like to the second day, you know that was God it was horrible that you know doing one pill day from two and a half to one so. You know I definitely frustrating, you know talk about natalie. And she was like Okay, well, we won't let this happen again, if you want, we can take you down to that, where you want to do another three often. Oh, I was like you know, I was like uh well, I was like you know i'd like to do that I was like so I said, can we talk about it hearing a 90 or more days you know, let me get up to six months marker. Before we put you know going down and then we'll talk, you know said order you know what I don't want to be a spokesperson forever I don't like owning like medication, but. You know I wanted to you know at least be okay, we you know be where i'm OK, and now you know it would have been for this program I literally would have been. You know at six months easily um you know I already know where i'm at six months so i'm like very happy, where I am right now, so I."
540.0,Provider,feel bad when it comes to like intensity.
2734.0,Patient,"there's gotta be more. We should have some on wi fi devices it's probably my wife by. It seems to always put in okay sorry, no, no do your. area I."
540.0,Provider,Do you feel good that kind of level of care wise when it comes to garner groups weekly seeing me twice a month.
2734.0,Patient,"Yes, that is awesome because you know if I wasn't able to get this kind of care before because. Transition you know issues yeah so Tele health has made a big difference, and you know and even bright heart being the people that you know they are that they you know I really feel like i'm cared about you know not not all the time, but yeah. You know most most of time I feel like you know thing I because I. I do get the feelings doctors do want to make sure that we're comfortable and we're okay and they're doing everything to Kim keeps relapsing. You know I do get that feeling and I do feel like you know we're all working toward in the biggest thing that I love about my heart really is the feeling of. The doctors don't aren't aren't looking at us as subjects of something that they're testing or you know we're would see what this does for you there i'm not being treated like usually i've been to be duck centers and and treatment centers and i've been treated, you know so. it's like I never listened they don't care, you know, like i'm like oh there's a you know you'd like. You tried to a doctor, well, I know that. What this is going to do to me and they're like Oh well, we're just going to drive 30 days and see how it goes anyways well i've done that, before and i'm telling you what i'm getting sick as hell and they're just like oh just give it a shot. And that shift would piss me off, because you know when I used to do to terminal treatment and oh my God was like they literally was trying to make me do a I don't know 1.5 and. i'm trying."
540.0,Provider,out can.
2734.0,Patient,"You on terminal so I don't know, I was, I was super glad that you know right away from that place, that was a St rita's hospital in. Lima that was crazy long time ago."
540.0,Provider,"Mario when you're in when you're in treatment and to actually be heard, like as a human being versus just feeling like a number."
2734.0,Patient,"Right that's and that's what I was feeling like you know, and you know when all this happened, you know they didn't know, do you know so, but let me get passed on X no ain't got a lot of time, so uh. So so then went from doctor to doctor Isaiah Okay, Dr Nathalie left and we talked about work, you know move me down to two to two posts, a month. You have to kill me. And when uh when she left she left notes in her thing for me for doctors am so when Dr dre as it came on you know. Everything was going good I was doing I was getting every two weeks, you know medication. And weekly you know, a group. Every two weeks vacation everything was going great and then all sudden. He uh Oh, the appointment, here it started out with cheryl the appointments to make out to get an appointment with cheryl was three months out. into that's why we're getting the missing shit you know and they started bridging me. And I told Dr as a I was like you know this thing right because you know I didn't even know anything about these until you know. So, and so, and then didn't know you know I find out, you know about it and I try to fix it and then that leaves and then you know it's dumped into your lap I was like you know you're just coming in, and he understood to. And so we had worked out where you know I had to do so much you know they tell you what you gotta do to get back in the green. And I got back into the green okay I got 1.0 I don't care back into the Green and he came back Dr day I had left okay that was his first firstly. And so, when he left you know I I had been back in the green for at least two weeks so when he did come back. I was like you know happy because I was ready to go back my you know because bridge script sucks I was on bridge trip for two to three weeks there. Every day, four days, four days, four days, four days so when he came back, I was like super happy, but I was like you know. whatever's going on, you know, with him, I was like obviously you know, because you could tell it, you know, he was. You know, whatever my family, you know was emergency whatever he's got one, so I was like you know let's get out, I was like well i'm gonna give him a break, you know i'm not. There was, like my stress on the him today because he just got back because I was wanting to go hey you know, on the back of my two weeks, you told me I could you know, three weeks since I seen you. Know i'm back in the green, well then, so I told him at group I told him that I was like hey i'm ready to go back into. My two weeks I got back in the green arrow games, again, I see that and I said Oh, if you don't I said, you know i'm not worried about it, right now, I was like because I already got my prescriptions bill. I was like I go pick a day and I was like so we can do this next week next group and he was like Okay, and then bringing our next weekend next on given a new doctor. So now I didn't get back on my two weeks I didn't get back in the Green and so that's where i'm at like you know it's been even though. it's if it's like a travesty that one doctor to another doctor and then, and then the real thing, so the pre authorization thing like I went three days out and then so, then I got back on track and then. They moved me down to to Dr Z and we have moved me down to two right before he left and then he told me. So, and then you know the pharmacy they don't tell you know because they just ask you during you have any questions and so here, I thought you know. I go get my prescriptions i'm getting them, you know weekly. You know until after they die they come back now he's not coming back from there 90 days, and you know go back to bi weekly, but now, here I am i'm just getting my projection. And i'm not looking at the bottle i'm not looking at account you know I mean so he moved me down to two a day. Because he read natalie's notes in 90 days we were going to you know go back to see what I wanted to do well, he thought that it meant that you know I wanted to move down to. So he automatically move on to and I didn't even notice, so now I go to the pharmacy and they're talking about we have strategy five days ahead. i'm like how the hell is that. So you know among care now of and everything and now i'm like bro straight i'm on the phone kroger you know rip in and find out come to find out. There when she reads the prescription to me i'm like oh my gosh she says two tablets find out today and i'm like wait no I get two and a half years, no you got down last month to two and i'm like wow so for a whole month I didn't even know. And here i've been taking two and a half i'm five you know i'm they're telling me i'm a week ahead of my thing you know that i'm supposed to even be. So, because I was knocked down to so i'm just like Okay, so now, I have no scripts you know because i've been taking them at two and a half. And so I I had to do an emergency bill would you only get one of those new life and they said they're there right. So that's Why did I did the emergency bill Okay, I was completely on my pills they're saying i'm fine you know five to seven days ahead. And I ain't got no pills whatsoever, so they didn't mean emergency film well, I thought well after date I took care of that that that emergency bill will take care of the. The this five to seven days I was ahead know they still got me five to seven days ahead, right now, so when I go in here to get my scripts. They you know they got me down as five to seven days ahead of my actual pills so but that's not that's not it I go when I go get my pills to pick them up. That I got to have that day that's what i'm out but they don't they don't know that for some reason they think i'm five days ahead because they never fixed it so that was something I wanted to bring up that was what it was, I wanted to bring up."
540.0,Provider,"alright. guys so medication I I don't really have too much control over usually what happens is, you have to call the virtual clinic you have to talk to like the rx team to say that they need to resolve that for you. and that's unfortunate thing is usually it's just calling the virtual clinic to let them figure out and whether or not they have to call pharmacy."
2734.0,Patient,Right.
540.0,Provider,And let them know the issue.
2734.0,Patient,"Right. yeah that's that's what I was like I keep forgetting to say that, because this this been happening for like three weeks or so, and you know as far as permissions concerned i'm getting my script five five days to a week ahead of time and."
540.0,Provider,increase back to the.
2734.0,Patient,"Two and a half, are you. Have but you know, but the thing is to they didn't want what they didn't do is wipe off the. The one thing they said he couldn't because when I took lady who I talked to said that I got a once once in a lifetime real emergency repo you know if you pills got stolen or lost or anything but I had to know what. Did I had told them what had happened and. They I just don't think they. Think."
540.0,Provider,hey i'm here for seven.
2734.0,Patient,"Days didn't they didn't like that five to seven days off so now, when I go and get my pills did their act like I got plenty of time. And I keep you know when I walk in there, they give me the strength look, because you know, every time the pharmacist or different you know, whatever they are dead people that just sent it to me. And they're like your five or seven days ahead, you know, whatever I in the are we telling me on my head that's what they are always telling your head of time your insurance will pay for tomorrow. And i'm like okay well you know when when they get filled I need them right then in there, you know. That that's time I need them and they're like well, you should it shouldn't be that way and i'm like I can't explain them, you know I mean because there's nothing they could do so what's the point of me explaining it, so I was super happy that you're. Doing, at least with the so there's not the same person I need I need to call to the Navigator and tell them, I mean talk to the pharmacy there are."
540.0,Provider,"Like the yeah the rx team and, just so that say that you've been having an issue where you were. A few weeks ago they messed up the medication dosage and now your pharmacies saying that you're five days ahead and not allowing you to get your medication."
2734.0,Patient,And just what. you're feeling.
540.0,Provider,"or your and your insurance companies, so that they can a lot of times their representative, whether or not it's a care navigator or the nurse and the rx team, they can call the pharmacy and try to figure out how we resolve this issue."
2734.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that's a that's crazy, you know it's it's like a it's almost like an argument because that's what I was talking about at group. I they get prescribed 20 which is eight days, because I get two and a half a day so. i'm right now with that happening. There what I was trying to sell was you know she prescribed them on Wednesday. And usually I would pick them up, you know I would go and pick them up the next day Thursday, but now, with this eight day stuff. I have to think okay well last week I picked him up on so so Dave so last week I got the last Tuesday, so this week I get him today when or yesterday Wednesday, you know and it this way, I have to keep going with is you know. it's like that. One day one day ahead of time every next week next week, it will be another day ahead of time. Or you know I don't I don't really like to have because I don't like the idea of me, being one day ahead every week eventually i'm going to be a you know so every week i'm getting one day ahead mean. So eventually i'm going to be a weeks ahead of time again, you know, and I just don't like that whole idea of I would rather just get my script and know that that's what I got for the week and that that's what it is, you know so i'm glad that we're getting this. helped me here to. Because i've been racking my brain about trying to explain it to somebody cuz. When I had my one on Dr sell. It was my first one on one you know so and she is you know new to me and i'm going to hurt like you're saying so more or less when I had that one on one it was more interested in the scene, you know what. What my needs and everything you know, and I never it never popped in my head that you know oh my God I just you going on, I guess you know, every day, like I every day I do one of those things where I do a clean slate wiped my brain like today, I just got to do, because the. X we can't do that no more I gotta think what we'll do for today, so the next day, when I go when it goes sleep I wake up, I literally do one day at a time like it, we say that's, the only way I can stay, you know focused and everything, because otherwise I started to get you started. And then we are one dirty know that that leads me that you know the. The addict will once overwhelmed they start to lose hope or or you know i'll fill be moralized or depressed or like I did something wrong or you know. And then I start to you know thinking, well, I know something that will make me happy, you know, and I don't I like being happy, who I am like this, you know, but sometimes you know it."
540.0,Provider,"just trying not to get ahead of yourself and. just trying to tackle it, little by little."
2734.0,Patient,"Right well see I was telling my mom is shaky. All those things going on to this House, oh my God, I was like she was like Oh, we got a chicken because i'm I just put anything on the stairs they were putting the closet underneath stairs and we put piling up and. She was like Oh, we got to put some things to fill this in and i'm like mom Okay, I was like listen. drink now you got me five Kevin don't buy things of like we got a plumbing leak here boom link there and I was like coming out here doing this now, I was like my car still need to fix you, and now we get to spend your winter weather coming in storm.

I don't really like it, but there's a lot of good there if if you're looking for good but there's bad costume being shoved bonus, you know don't get that."
540.0,Provider,"I think so it's I mean we I know we talked about it in group but knowing that everything we look at is filtered the good the bad, but understanding that we have, we have a saying what we see too so."
2734.0,Patient,"But it's what cookies are is why can't then like a. mother whose mom she's an avid I call her ambulance chaser anytime as she sees those six likes she takes off to see what's going on okay. Now if they're over here, though, oh my God she hiding scared of them i'm like are you chasing them in the other time, but now they're coming to our House, you know. And even even if they're just here for a something that we've called them here, for you know, like a. may be possible fire in the wall, or anything you know, every time she ran and hid like a little privacy, but i'm just like damn it anytime anybody, you know even a neighbor's House if their names i've. got to see what's going on, you know fire, you know, whatever policing anything but when they come here it's a whole different story and i'm just like you know, I was like see it's only what catches your eye. In and I don't like that the feeling that you know we as people would. We were Okay, with what we see that's happening to other people, and never think that you know that could happen to us to I that's what my mentality, or is it been since a lot of things you know, since all this drug crap. I don't know I think this is defined me in a way, you know it's good and look like you're sharing i'll bring religion, I felt, you know a little bit overwhelmed from you know I didn't want to bring it up, and I was trying to insult anybody, and you know so, but when I was bringing up religion. You know, for me, i'm a I believe I I really believe that what they say because that's something that was instilled in me in prison that God only gives you what you can handle. And if you think that you can on the more you can because he's going to show you can, and you know what I say that he'd be hard and you because eventually he need you, for, for whatever reason, and i've found lots of times that you know there's things I. contemplated with you know when the only when you talk to in prayer or you know, maybe just some thought, and then things have happened that you know just are unbelievably you know, like how to how you know how did that person come in contact with me and and you know how. And I. I don't mean I don't try to i'm not trying to push my my religion on anybody, but things happened to me all law, and I really that's why I believe the way I do, I mean. i'm not saying that there is a man that sits up on top, the throne and, but when you got things happening to you and. you wonder why those things are happening, I mean you know we all say God for some reason in some sort of way you know. Everybody would say you know the god's doing this to me and now well he maybe he is going to and there's a reason for it, and if you didn't like the reason you know Okay, maybe you're thinking about the wrong way because i've learned that I can help people with what i've gone through. If it wasn't for me going through what i've gone through. You know i've got friends now who. I maybe talk to you know and have a real good relationship with being open about certain things that I, I wished, I could have been open sooner, because it would have helped me, but you know. i'm glad I went through what I went through, because if the women for going through I wouldn't be I don't think i'd be this person right here, I think I would be because I used to be. What do you call an alpha male I used to be one of those all about me everything I wanted I had you know and anything I could go anywhere and. Would whatever it was that I wanted I had it was just that simple, you know I walk into a place, and I want that car. i'm driving it, you know, and then you know things happened, and now you know i'm not that person anymore. Now I don't think I can get anything I want and I don't think I own I used to be an owner to I used to think I owned everything, so in that included my relationship, when I started, because I was young, you know and. things that happened to me were really young you know where things that's me, but I think that affected me a lot, too, but. I used to think I owned you know people I owned our relationship, I I own you can't go you just can't go do that unless I otherwise i'll take this from y'all take that from and. You know i've had to like deep smack in the face when I was in person like hey you know and it finally hit mean, I think that was a I really I do believe that on my religion that. I can. yeah. I really believe that that happened to me, and you know because I was supposed to change and because I now my eyes are open to to seeing more than most people see I always think it's so weird."

You know either side of something something happening i'll actually say God, you know you don't know what that person's going through. And you don't know what that person is going through and yeah you know, things are happening that you know but don't sit here on progress those things, because that makes you what you know. An instigator but you know that that's the way a lot of things are anymore, we got people oh let's get our phone to take pictures of this. And then you know how do you react to that you know that's crazy, but you know that it's the gates things you know, because now they know people think they got to put on a show for this camera you know and. it's so it's so weird how really how media has made made its way into everybody, not everybody because they're still Amish people who knowing watch TV at all. But it makes sense, you know you know I mean it has made its way into everybody's head in some way or fashion, even are they know. That that the media has somehow a tried to make this a firm stand on that they're important you know and it shouldn't be gossip that important, it should be the realization of who the real person is, and you know finding out so it's."

540.0,Provider,"For transcription I just want to know take that. Kenneth his GA D was a level three and then pH Q nine was level to both of them minimal spectrum and one thing that popped up minimally was his sleep and tiredness he talks about that in group a lot. And just that he has a lot of stuff going on at home, a lot of things that are breaking in the House that he just sleepless nights looks around and. He lives in the basement so a lot of the issues is the plumbing so that is located in the basement on so just causes him a lot of stress and worry and which leads to the two parts of the pH Q nine so a lot of That just goes hand in hand right now again it's minimal. Just level, one for each of one of those so a lot of it is just trying to help him like he was talking about where he just needs to try to do it, day by day, making those smart goals and just seeing what's going to be manageable each day, and so I guess long term goal right now is still. He wants to be able to fix up the House to get it to be able to be sold and then for them to get into a smaller place and then short term goals is just working through that stress that's going on at home. Talking and communicating with his brothers, to see if they can do more in the House with the responsibilities. And then that's really it. Thank you, and for for uds. He didn't do it for a. While I guess they they sent it out on the 31st so he just got it so he'll be doing the uds today, he said."
