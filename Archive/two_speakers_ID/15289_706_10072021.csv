15289.0,Patient,"When. Things are getting better at the House but. it's still it's essential it's hard little with other people, you know I don't know I don't. They got on me me me me because I get me along waiter better than you know, I was using so that's a big plus. You know. And then we just not be in there for the kids like I should have been, and you know now i'm there and. He."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so how long have you been in recovery."
15289.0,Patient,I have it in my know out.
706.0,Provider,"Okay. fairly recent Oh, you are definitely adjusting to life that is not built around finding. Finding drugs using drugs paying how you're going to pay for drugs, and I mean that's just when you are in active addiction that's what your whole life revolves around how am I going to get it where, am I going to get it. Is it going to be enough do I have enough money if I don't how am I going to get the money like that's how your whole world like takes up all your time and now that you don't have that taking up your time it's almost like a culture shock because you're like wow there's like other. there's other stuff in life, besides being high there's other stuff in life, besides trying to not get sick so. So it's going to be really hard for you to. Just feel content with life because you have all of this extra time now and you're really not sure what to do with that so early. yeah so early on what I recommend is really sitting down and focusing on. structuring your day, like every every little piece like this is the time I get my kids up this is when I have breakfast this is when i'm going to have lunch in between i'm going to do this. Because really what you have to do is structure your day, so you keep it a full because that's going to keep your mind from going to that place of Oh, I want to use like i'm. it's not that you want to use, but you you miss that being preoccupied with going to use now you now you have nothing to occupy your time you're just sitting there twiddling your thumbs and you just have all this idle time. um so just structuring your day, so you can stay busy, and then also figuring out who are you now, because who you are now. As like I like to say the upgraded version of you is very different than who you were when you were actively using. And so now, you need to figure out, you know what do you like to do what brings you to a peaceful place when you're stressed, what are your coping skills. um you know what do you, what do you want to do with your life moving forward, you know, like what do you want to do you know i'll all of those things, and so. first step is just structuring your day, so your body and your mind knows what to expect all day, every day, so it doesn't think Oh well, I have nothing to do I should probably use. Does that make sense."
15289.0,Patient,"yeah it does it does make sense, because exactly that's exactly right, I do have idea more time, you know, but I did write that down that you said. schedule schedule schedule and I have that written on my binder on a piece of paper schedule schedule schedule, you know, like so I get the kids off at a certain time for school and then you know I normally have them dare made by certain time when they get long so."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
15289.0,Patient,I do have time to like you know.
706.0,Provider,"yeah and then you know schedule things during your day, so you know if you enjoy like going for a walk then schedule, at a certain time every day that you go for a walk. You know if you enjoy doing like art stuff schedule, every day, at a certain time to do that art stuff. Just whatever it is that you wouldn't boy doing schedule that into your day it's going to fill your day it's going to bring me to a peaceful place. And then you know, and then we set goals from there, so now that we've got ourselves kind of on a schedule were. You know kind of getting back into what they call a normal life a normal consistent structure day and you can start looking at I could probably get a job, because I can now structure my time I have time management. I can work from this time to this time and it will fit into my structured day does that make sense. So you know, this is just those baby steps to get you to the bigger goals, because ultimately typically when I talk to people their goal is always. I need to work because either we're working and aren't or they've lost their job due to circumstances or whatever it may be, and it's like the big stresses like I need to work if I could work. That would take some of the financial stress off me would take stress off my relationship, it would make me feel like i'm a productive member of society, again, and not just what people say you know are like leeches they just leech on and just kind of suck the blood. You know, so all of those things are just those baby steps to get you to those those bigger goals. So you know and sometimes it's just sitting down and figuring out what your goals are so."
15289.0,Patient,I have to get there one day at a time. it's not any better.
706.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely absolutely so and you take everything, one day, at a time and that that's why structuring your day is so important because. Your body, as well as your mind knows what to expect, and when you get to that last step of your day, then you know that day is over that's one more day you have in recovery and that's all you can do is just keep building the days. You know, and then pretty soon you're at three months, you know, six months, nine months and it's just you know every day you just add another day. So."
15289.0,Patient,"unnamed is so much about go so much better, I already feel better."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah absolutely and so for the before the next time we meet, what I want you to do is sit down and try and figure out what your short term goals are what you want to achieve. And then, what your marker short term goals are and we'll talk about them next time and come up with a plan to start moving in that direction, so you feel that you're making some progress, because. Looking looking forward and and working towards goals and looking for positive things is going to motivate you to do better looking backwards and focusing on all the things that you did wrong is going to make you stand still. Does that make sense."
15289.0,Patient,"I will do short john yes, it does."
706.0,Provider,"Okay perfect. yeah and just remember when you. Have when you have your therapy sessions. I mean we can you can go up to 15 minutes late, where you can be let in but we only have certain amounts of time for each patient, so your half hour got cut to 15 minutes and I think. That I know. it's Okay, so I just think."
15289.0,Patient,it's understandable.
706.0,Provider,"for you to have that entire half hour. So maybe, just like setting alarms on your phone to remind you hey I have an appointment those kinds of things."
15289.0,Patient,"I do I need to I need to i'm not very good with things like that, like. well."
706.0,Provider,Another thing I some of my patients is get bright colored like neon sticky notes and stick them like all over like stick them on the bathroom mirror stick them by your bed.
15289.0,Patient,so that everybody can catch your eye. Everybody should.
706.0,Provider,"you're like Oh, I have an appointment on you know this day at this time, because then Everywhere you go, you have constant reminders and your brain will subconsciously absorb that. And then, on that day in that time your brain will remember, and then, if you have a alarm set on your phone as well, then you've got kind of a dual. thing to help you remember, because it's difficult like I said when you haven't had any structure or normalization to your life to then have appointments and things you have to do every day it, you know it definitely is it's a change it's an adaption so. we'll just continue to work on it and. just get a hold of virtual clinic and set up here appointments will meet twice a month and then we'll you'll be having your groups weekly so definitely get all your therapy and make sure you're taking doing your us all your surveys everything to stay in compliance. yeah alright sounds great well, I will."
15289.0,Patient,You Stacy.
706.0,Provider,"yep. I will see you in a couple of weeks, then."
15289.0,Patient,"Alright, have a good day."
706.0,Provider,"You too bye bye. samantha McDonald is a low suicide risk at this time protective factors include her children and her children's father, as well as her determination to do better. Some factors that. Negative triggers would be her depression, which she reports as less than a five at this time as well as the new life that she's trying to live, where she is silver."
