ID,Role,Message
11957.0,Patient,hey how are you.
298.0,Provider,driving.
11957.0,Patient,No well i'm around the corner trust me it's fine i'm literally my I was at the 711 to grab up like a water water bottle and my business where i'm going to be sitting for this is literally one block.
298.0,Provider,Okay i'm just gonna have you turn off your camera. Okay i'm.
11957.0,Patient,"Okay, and it's now and three I put it on the dock."
298.0,Provider,Okay. Do you run just let me know when you're stopped.
11957.0,Patient,Literally it'll be like. 30 seconds.
298.0,Provider,Okay okay perfect yeah just let me know. i'm here.
11957.0,Patient,"was like rushing to this client that I thought it was 345 so I was like on your ID and I was like oh Fuck I need to check in first and. Running and then she goes into that, for I was like Oh, thank God 345."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
11957.0,Patient,"All right, I am parking lot now. I had to go grab lunch so hungry. Late lunch."
298.0,Provider,"yeah there's only one healthy lunch, though."
11957.0,Patient,"Okay, so i'm just walking into my office but we're totally fine so. All right."
298.0,Provider,Doing.
11957.0,Patient,"Good. I did. want to say, for it at the five next days in a row I was up by like either seven eight or nine and then like stayed up all day yeah and then. holy shit that guy's hot roof. And then. he's uh he's like all ass so I could not look he's a or sorry and then one of the days I just was like. wide awake you know and and just stayed up really late, but then I forced myself the next day i'm like well then you're going to be tired all day. yeah but the same time, because I realized i'm an idiot for thinking one day should be sufficient like you have to keep doing it and it's like such common sense. That you have to keep doing it to get out of it, it makes sense, like it could take a few weeks, you know I mean that pattern. You know, to get back into a habit that you've been doing the opposite of this, the whole time you know, so it was like oh yeah dude relax it doesn't matter if it takes two to three weeks of hit and Miss just to get back to that schedule, it can take a while just chill out, you know."
298.0,Provider,"Typically. Typically, takes three weeks to break a habit right or to create a habit."
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,And a 20.
11957.0,Patient,"Every week everywhere, I was saying, like everything's always like extreme balls to the walls like chill out, it can take a while."
298.0,Provider,"This is actually a really good test for you right now to just kind of. sit with this it's uncomfortable because it's not happening overnight, but it's actually a really good thing for you, I think this type of practice."
11957.0,Patient,"yeah and and the thing is like. I don't know how how sometimes we forget things but. I was always so good at everything, and I even knowing that information was it would be like information I would give someone you know and so. it's like i'm always so extreme with myself and so hard on myself and i've been kind of putting in more information out there, like, for my brain to figure out for me, you know. And I was like i've been hearing these patterns I keep seeing number, I was saying before the tech talks pop up, and it was like childhood trauma causes these behaviors and these things and those things and I was like. My mom would always be like she would walk in the door and i'd be like in my room or somewhere in the House. And she would go gather like like something fucking was emergency right, and I would go running like what what go get the groceries and i'm like. Always anxiety and and there's all this trauma shit that gets created. And I realized those behaviors of perfectionism hard on yourself for any little thing bad or wrong pleasing others for like all that shit is learned shit that doesn't even feel right for me to be because my personality so independent. You know so it's like i'm my brain is showing me more and more things that cause these other things you know."
298.0,Provider,You have to reprogram.
11957.0,Patient,Sometimes right.
298.0,Provider,"you've been programmed to you know react certain ways, or to be hyper vigilant right or. Yes, indeed variant face traumas at an early age yeah."
11957.0,Patient,"And, and part of that is that home stuff for sure, like just thinking of it now i'm like sick to my stomach you know. But that and also all that hyper vigilant from finding people looking in my windows multiple times and like being you know mugged on the way to the street go to go to the corner store for candy getting jumped. Like it happened, every time like something always went wrong, you know or. I was you know at the Bowling alley and and I was very naturally feminine and these like crowds of Dudes would just start fucking bullying you and then like aggressively bullying you like like forceful. You know very angry i'm going to fucking beat your at all that shit to where you're like always running and hiding and finding some adult and i'm like my brains remembering. 789 all these things that I had no control over as a child and no adults were protecting you like in school elementary school junior high all this stuff's coming up where. Now, as an adult i'm like it was never your fault dude they should have protected you they should have stepped in and said. leave this fucking kid alone or you're out of here and they should have made me feel safe and they never did they would be like oh you guys are just kids being kids to have it i'm like no they literally said i'm in my high school, one of my high school teachers. I remember saying, then stop being a fag like I remember all these things and i'm like oh my God it was always on me to grow up so fast so hard. That it's no wonder, I needed a fucking break and took the opiates instead of drinks, because I didn't like those outcomes and all the emotions and crap right. So i'm just finding my reasons that that led to this behavior you know those traumas growing up so fast getting a job at a bank at 16 always being super like because I wanted to protect myself, I wanted to be successful and go get my own life to protect myself. Even from my family."
298.0,Provider,"Because that's how you program yourself, you programmed yourself."
11957.0,Patient,And survive.
298.0,Provider,survival mode yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"hundred percent, and so I realized like. Because I told you, I was a cop right."
298.0,Provider,"I think you did early on, when. We started meeting."
11957.0,Patient,"Those two things couldn't live in the same body, because I would be judgmental in the past younger years i'd be judgmental of someone like me today, but I notice the universe has this thing of anytime I judge someone very severely for something. it's usually two days, two weeks or two years the universe gives me that situation and puts me in it to learn and not judge that way you know what I mean. And so i'm like. it's just mind blowing to me that you end up here. But it's also not mind blowing but but, at the time that like I couldn't accept. That I was that and also this you know but it's The more I dug the more I found out. COPs judges, lawyers firemen nannies mechanics anybody and everybody goes through stuff like this and it's perfectly acceptable and normal. And then that led me back to ya dub because you were taught by your mom, and all this crazy religion and craziness that guilt and fear that's why you couldn't ever be vulnerable or exposed or be anything other than perfect you know what I mean. So it's just like all these patterns pop up and they just instantly connect and like. I know you get it, I try not to explain this to other people, because I talk so quick and sporadic but I get the logic and they just think that crazy, so I don't talk to anybody else you know but."
298.0,Provider,it's all these things. Right I kind of want to go back to what you were saying to about your trauma it's like you were the target here right with the bullying and.
11957.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
298.0,Provider,"It had it really had nothing to do with you and everything to do with that person or those people feeling so uncomfortable in themselves so insecure, in themselves, but while you get the you got all the backlash for it. yeah and that's paints that's a lot of painting carry you know. Oh yeah years um so I just wanted to say that because that really caught my attention also um you wanting to explain these things to other people you care so much about what you've learned because you've been through this, this has been your experience right. For me. For somebody that hasn't been through the same experiences and doesn't have the same knowledge, understanding and awareness that you do you try and tell them. You know, even for people in recovery who aren't in recovery if somebody is trying to explain to them, while living a life in recovery is just so rewarding you just."
11957.0,Patient,Right yeah.
298.0,Provider,Unless that person is willing to look in the mirror for themselves it's really hard for them to grass things like. yeah is it makes people uncomfortable in our sins in our society.
11957.0,Patient,"I mean, I do tell like my two or three super close friends. All of which were somewhat similar with like analyzing information that's why we're so friends, you know, probably but. You know it's like I forget that. When I have a client who i've had a long time was also kind of a friend, I can go down these roads be and i'm telling myself like you need to just. Because when you asked me something if someone asked me how you're doing i'm going to tell you. But then I realized oh wait, you need to be a little a little surface and fake and be like all things are great business is good and just leave it alone, because you can't go down these roads with strangers they're not going to get it, you know."
298.0,Provider,Have we ever talked about Bernie brown Are you familiar.
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,Have you seen her netflix talk on.
11957.0,Patient,yeah we watched it.
298.0,Provider,Give me watch it in group. What did you think about that.
11957.0,Patient,"I felt like. It reinforced all the beliefs, that I have about behaviors and and and emotions and. I don't. want to this isn't an arrogance thing, but like just the other day I sat and talked with my friend about his situation and and i'm a person that people go to a lot for you know, help and. They always say like Todd you're like a therapist and even even certain clients that are. Also gay and they come in they're referred by other people that i've done great work on their face and then they'll come in and be like. You know, tell you everything on the table type thing and then I remember every detail, but everybody's just how my brain is and so like even the other day. This guy haven't seen in a while, and I said so what's going on you're married a guy that you're having the intimacy with like, how did it end up because you said you were taught and he's like holy shit out of you now. And I started remembering i'm like well you've been with this guy 17 years. And you told him in the beginning about the passion and he kind of blew you off, and now it makes sense that you're seeking intimacy somewhere else and he's like you said everything my therapist told me yesterday. Like it's just awesome right I love it, but it doing it when I heard her, I felt like yeah this is already in your brain it's just remembering to apply it to you, and not just. United being not just knowing it, or helping others but giving yourself the same. Patient and. Understanding, you know. And that can be a little hard for some reason to do to yourself."
298.0,Provider,Why do you think that is.
11957.0,Patient,"Because. Because I learned somewhere to be hypercritical of myself, probably because of all the the bullying and religion, shame and guilt so you're always looking at yourself and thinking you're bad and you're flawed and something's wrong with you so i'm always. thinking that i'm not good enough, probably in some ways for that for that same information, you know."
298.0,Provider,And we live in a society of. systematic oppression. And you feel that.
11957.0,Patient,"Absolutely, I had. Sorry, it keeps interrupting my business line I keep. Actually, I can turn that focus thing on so I don't get any stupid interruptions. yeah I think that's what it is, is. You know, when you figure something out you kind of go oh now I get it, and I remember in my early early to mid 20s going through this real revelation period where. I was able to let go of all this fear from religion that was instilled by parents and and church and I remember. letting go of all this societal stuff and being like Okay, I get it people just don't understand so. And you and I remember having that moment, letting it all go and I thought it was over, but you don't realize how much shit later comes out that you just because I logically understood it didn't mean it was behaviors weren't you know what I mean like it's so much still there."
298.0,Provider,And it doesn't make it less painful.
11957.0,Patient,"No, and I don't I don't feel that's the thing to unless I unless I magically learned how to put it in a box and buried or something. I don't I don't feel like. When I think of people in the past that did those things I just think well how could they know they've never been in my position. And I know now that most things, people say to others out of hate anger feet, whatever it's just like you said it's insecurity and projection most of the time. yeah and and I know that now. That I don't ever feel."
298.0,Provider,resentment.
11957.0,Patient,"know I feel like that was their human condition at the time, so that's just what they were you know."
298.0,Provider,"So I guess time I hear that it still has an effect on you. Right. 200% until so when was it that was it when you started realizing and having a better understanding and like. Oh, this was their own reaction to this, not necessarily to me."
11957.0,Patient,"Where yeah healing. Or what. I think I understood that years ago. I just don't think I understood that it could have such an effect that was buried deep in your subconscious or something, and that those things would come out later. Through certain behaviors."
298.0,Provider,Such as numbing. yeah yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"numbing because there's probably this constant overriding. emotion or state that I was in that I learned how to survive, I learned how to appear normal and learned how to do even police work, you know managing banks doing all that and and and still appear completely fine, but at home emotionally you're not fine and. And, probably because. Even even actively Barry are pushing it away because you're like. you're not even really sure what's causing it this that the underlying sadness or underlying unfulfilled feelings or you know, whatever, that is, and you know, I think that those things are probably the residual result of that pain and trauma and fear and doubt and all that stuff."
298.0,Provider,So what I hear is the biggest step for you is being able to identify what that was.
11957.0,Patient,Right this.
298.0,Provider,"This pain is coming from, this is why I had to bury this for so long um. yeah where's that now, where you at with it now with this trauma and this this pain and."
11957.0,Patient,"Well, I feel like i'm in the same place, I just realized now like what caused that behavior and also like admitting to yourself things about family like okay. Your dad had an addiction issue, and I look at that and go well yeah look at his parents and look at. How he was raised, and he had a wife and kids at 21 so no wonder, he ran off and do drugs and get an ice cream education, he had no coping skills. So, is that it education, the main thing, or is it the nature nurture because people that have fucking PhDs go through this too and they're intelligent. So it's not that it's a nurture thing it's something that you lacked and bit manifested later, and you know, eventually, he dealt with it, however, he dealt with it probably more than likely through religion or you know. Some other thing but. I guess for me right now I just feel like. I realized that's probably where it came from I realized that's that's what it is. It makes sense that I had these huge event stacks that I can recognize that would make anyone want to have a release you know and. When i'm really honest I remember. Being. Around there. And I don't even know how it got in my head I don't even know how meds or pills got in my head, but I remember. Seeking them back then, and then letting all that go because I wanted this other future career and then kind of like oh that's my recreational thing Oh well, whatever, but then 10 years past nothing, nothing zero. But then I go no you're not being honest there's a pattern in your eat it goes deeper back to those times, and so, then, if I go during that time. You were seeking it then it was still because of you were so close to all that stress still so close to all that trauma still that's unresolved, you know and that's probably the escape or numbing that I needed then. Just to feel relief in your brain, you know something like. That makes a lot of sense actually."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah it feels like you have a lot of the answers and awareness that you've been searching for.
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,Years yeah. How does it feel just to talk about it.
11957.0,Patient,"Well, certain times like normally it's it's fine I guess in talking to you right now. there's certain things coming up that's causing emotion I just don't know why."
298.0,Provider,"And you think it's Okay, not to know why. Just identifying that there is this emotion coming up."
11957.0,Patient,sure.
298.0,Provider,Talk about that and process what that emotion feels like for you right now.
11957.0,Patient,It feels it feels sad.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"feel sad and also feel stupid, you know, like. it's sad because. Because there's this person that just didn't have. Any like. bad for the me back then. It does that for him."
298.0,Provider,And you feel like the child and you still deserves that nurturing and that love that it was neglected that you were neglected.
11957.0,Patient,"in prison yeah. But I also go like okay well that's the today's bucket today, you know, like. you're fine today everything's great you have a lot that's awesome you can you can realize it but. What ultimately is I can do, I mean it does feel warm right now, like it feels good to realize it feel it and actually it's like it's probably getting smooth it out, you know. In a way, which is good."
298.0,Provider,"Much has been buried inside of you, and when we bury these emotions. They don't go anywhere. Right there's no release when we bury them. yeah means there's no healing and burying them. So they sit inside of us and the power in these emotions build them that's why they say you know when you are secrets keep us sick. So when we're. able to lay these things out of US that's where the healing is. And I do, I heard a little bit of deflecting there right going back to today. But in this moment, even if we are being mindful in this moment being present. That child is still there inside of you that needs your love."
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Right and it's. Okay, if, today you have all this and you know. All that looks not minimize that there's still this part of you."
11957.0,Patient,"yeah I just mean like. So far, i've survived, and I also protected, that person very well very well. And you're you really are you have you know we have love, we have connections sure, but everything's temporary. You just have to you so. It is what it is."
298.0,Provider,"And so that's a good point, because if you're not kind to yourself if you don't love yourself. Right."
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"That guy that kind of like you know we're not together, but we feel like we're together. He came over again unexpectedly, and we were talking and. I saw. I saw like. Who, he is right now was me like 10 years ago. Like emotionally mentally these issues with like family and religion and be judged and all this head noise, when you go to a he went to a family event for holidays and he's Iraqi so it's a big family. and With each other it's been two years of this amazing stuff like couple times a week, but I realized like. there's the same pattern. In the in the gay scene of like. This really horrible. alienation that you learned so you're even within your family because they look at you different right, so you learn to recognize it and then you learn to conform and hide. Because you learn how to chameleon to any situation it's probably why i'm so good, with people, because I can chameleon into anything anytime. Which is a great survival tool but. I noticed that. The key brought up. I just always hate going to family stuff and everyone says that you know, regardless of your sexuality, but. When he was explaining it, it was like oh my God, I remember all those things, every time it was Christmas holiday season we're going to. Do i'm supposed to be happy going to my mom's at my grandma's with all my uncles and cousins and I was always just nervous because. i'm the only one that's gay everyone has someone else, everyone has some other half back then I could bring someone, it would have been a problem. Then I learned the stage of when I would talk about it because I started getting more and more forceful, as I went through my 20s. With like this is, who I am Fuck you, you know, so I started like my mom's friend from school Shannon she's. As long as far as I know, lesbian, but then she married a guy for a while, then a chick still wish he wants, but my mom was okay with that. never said anything to her about religion or God, but i'm also her kid so at her mind again, but when I would be there Shannon but asked me like so what's going on a dating anyone and i'm like oh yeah there's this guy blah blah, and I would I would notice my mom like. kind of just like. Oh, I need to be in that room and just go away, you know, and you notice all this all the time and you're like how the Fuck than can I be close to you, I cannot be close to you I can't be what you need me to be. All the time and also. need myself, because you don't like who I am at the Court, you know what I mean, like you, you love me, but you wish I was different. I know that my whole life it's never bothered me. And i've never cried talking about it ever It makes sense, knowing who she is and how she is but I guess i'm realizing talking to a therapist that it that it shows you the emotion that it did to you, though, deep down."
298.0,Provider,there's pain in that statement.
11957.0,Patient,"But I don't I don't immediately feel it like my brain goes logically that makes sense, so what you know but talking to you about it so now is triggering like. Well done, that was someone else you were giving advice to you'd be like that Fuck you up and you don't even know it. You know. It makes it. that's it that's how it's always been you know it's like. it's really I just said there I said look. If you want me to be around here. you're going to get over it, I don't want to hear it another fun thing about God or religion or the Bible, I said, I do not believe in that shit. i'm telling you now that's your fantasy that's your life blog that's your situation it's not for me that's it I don't care so if you want me around I don't want to hear it again I don't want to know anything about your belief system. And you do that or not, because if you can't i'm not coming around here anymore, and she was like I just want you, healthy and happy that's it look fun did leave it alone, you know. But that took me years to get to that point years there was a lot of trauma from that mom a lot."
298.0,Provider,yeah so you got to a place where you could set those strong boundaries with her.
11957.0,Patient,"Oh big time like I even text, my friend, like three years ago, but necessary she's been around since I was 21. And I was like look what she's saying now dude because she has the same issue with her parents be jobs with she's really emotionally messed up man like she's a great person, but she just so hard so fucking beyond heart. But. We share with each other, these things you know. And I sent her the screenshots because she knows my mom well. And she was like. This is probably three years ago she was like wow dude you're a man now and I was like why and she said, because you never would you always. Would cave to her or cower to her or. give her her way or let her be dominant and all that you know, and you don't anymore like I literally told her stop sending me scriptures and links to Jesus shit I do not believe in this, you need to respect my boundaries I just fucking flat out told her. wow Okay, I just want you to know God loves you I said you're doing it right now you're not respecting me I don't care about your God your sky wizard I don't give a Fuck you know, like you have to stop. and That was it like. My cousin who i'm real close to Sarah is real close to them too, and her nivea closest we were little like two three years old. And she was over a lock she was doing some work with them. And she said. She goes yeah I didn't want to tell you, but it came up something came up about like why Kevin isn't around anymore are coming up all the time, and she said, I told them because. He always has to do the work and because he always has to come, be the one to go to you, and because you preach it him. And my mom told me that, like last year and I said mom I don't think you preach it you haven't done that in years and she's like yeah I haven't done that years I can't be why, and I said it's not exactly why, but there is some residual shit there that makes me not want to do it, you know. Like, for example, I can't help but notice things, even though I don't feel emotion I go, you know it's fucked up that gay marriage passed in 2012 I wanted me up and say oh congratulations i'm so happy for you yeah. never, never that's not even on the radar because they don't want that, deep down, I know, deep down that. Family loves me but wishes, I was different, but my other family my aunts and uncles and all their debut evolves really far and they just love the shit out of me like now, they don't care about that at all, but that took time to you know. and I guess when I really looked at all that it's like that's a lot of. feeling alone. Not just being alone, but actually feeling alone. Like Oh, you have your friends your family and I used to always go it's not enough I don't have intimacy I don't have nurturing from you know. And it kind of blew my mind with that guy with us talking and all those patterns came up and I was like God he's dealing with the same thing. We over sexualized the eggs and the gacy because we don't have intimacy it's we didn't have. i'd never held a group of guys hand like guys and girls do at the park at the mall highschool sweetheart growing up, we didn't have any of that building of intimacy to learn how relationships work we had sex via closed doors in secret. So how can we ever have intimacy it real relationships that's why it's over hyper sexualized there's a massive drug problem in the gay scene. Of course there is look at this word diapers so we just are starting out and and everything is hidden and over over about your appearance right there's no real connection and love and like. it's rare, but we didn't learn that from our parents, most of us we didn't have any of that cultivation and that's why things are, how they are you know and like it's just bizarre but also it makes a lot of sense and. it's feel like i'm just tired reading now, no, no kinds of thoughts."
298.0,Provider,Like you're saying a lot today a lot of powerful stuff is coming up um but what I ultimately here is that you're no longer in that place where you're willing to conform and fit and.
11957.0,Patient,I haven't done that.
298.0,Provider,People come for. know in a place where you. You are going to belong right or remove yourself and set some boundaries.
11957.0,Patient,"Well it's more than that for me right now, and the way I would say the last probably five or six years has been. Is I have standing in the world period I don't need to explain apologize justify myself, I will go anywhere, I want to whatever I want and. that's it you don't that person is irrelevant, the everyone's irrelevant, I can I can FLEX However, I want wherever I want, but getting that kind of confidence, you know takes took a lot but. it's it's sort of like well if you have a problem with something, then I guess you shouldn't be around me that's up to you, but i'm going to be here here, and here you know I don't care if I don't have that problem anymore."
298.0,Provider,And it's not your job to take care of everybody else it's your job to take care of you.
11957.0,Patient,"And that's probably more like the last year or so that i've been able to do that. And really truly be like sorry that's on you click i'm not writing all the messages i'm not sending all those because I was like that I would send. Endless messages and solve everyone's problems and give them answers would try this try this, what about this, what Fuck you dude i'm done internalizing everyone's shit i'm done."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
11957.0,Patient,For these magical.
298.0,Provider,And you're working with on your relationship with yourself and I hear they're still work there.
11957.0,Patient,There is.
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"there definitely is, I think we all always have worked but."
298.0,Provider,"course yeah i'm and if you. recognize or hear yourself talking to yourself, and you wouldn't talk to anybody else like that, if you wouldn't even talk to a stranger like that I think that's something to let's process that what's going on that, where you feel it's okay to talk to yourself, this way."
11957.0,Patient,"yeah I don't have. I have, I don't have a lot of negative self talk anymore. Okay that's really that's really, really, I have a very, very I guess you could call it what mainstream would call it as a metaphysical view. Which is just that I know that words are like spells and I know that your cells feel everything resonating your body based on your thoughts I know that's true and I know that what you think you are you become, and I know that. When I even in the last six months, when I start having the negative self talk in my brain or start seeing negative annoying things I go. that's ridiculous you have your health you're happy and healthy and look at all these other people's This is fine and i'm rejecting them and, like through neuro plasticity i'm starting to rewire and they don't start negative anymore, you know, like it's starting to just shift into like. A millisecond of negative and you go no nope and it's okay. And that's going to become the new normal because i'm going to keep doing it over and over till it is."
298.0,Provider,Why i'm recommended you listen to Louise hay on YouTube I recommend her a lot she does a lot of great affirmation work if you ever feel like you just want to listen to some she's a great person to listen to.
11957.0,Patient,Louise hay.
298.0,Provider,yeah check her out. yeah absolutely um she's a great one around affirmations and reprogramming.
11957.0,Patient,"yeah That would be good just just to keep you know, keep things going."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"I guess I just feel like I know that. i've known a lot of these things. I just, I guess, I never really. talked about from a vulnerable perspective, it was always just from a hard perspective, you know."
298.0,Provider,yeah from your survival mode right your.
11957.0,Patient,Cuts me just.
298.0,Provider,Protecting yourself.
11957.0,Patient,"And also always feeling like you have to be strong, no matter what like you have to be the toughest person that it yeah I know that, so it doesn't affect me but that's not. it's not like being vulnerable that way has always been associated with weakness, like, for example, when I hear this current. trend in the environment of like let's say you're at work you're going to meeting that all this new stuff is like oh everyone's like like. Fake right like oh that was such a wonderful report you did it's like oh shut the Fuck up I don't want to hear that fake praise bullshit you know what I mean. And so, when I hear myself, sometimes I do that to myself, like that was really sad or that was really probably hard on you, or whatever i'm like now that was just what it was instead of letting that. out."
298.0,Provider,that's a little harsh yeah. yeah that's hard. to feel whatever comes up for you right.
11957.0,Patient,"When I go through all those thoughts and stuff that was normal so now realizing it's not normal, you have to re re do them, you know. It wasn't normal to have that happen in school it wasn't normal to be unprotected so long, like that wasn't normal to. And my friend certain people noakes we've talked about him but. When I guess I realized when you keep talking about something, and you, you go yeah but that's just what it was if it keeps coming up then it's unresolved. You know, even if you think it is it's not. And that's what that's what happens a lot these stories in my head of like. You were 16 you had a job at Bank of America, I was the youngest person ever hired. My dad's truck sat in the garage it was new and my mom had a car and then my dad had a work truck so his truck sack because he had a work truck. And I remember saying, I have to save money to buy a car and I i'm so young, with a really good job already so I was like. mom can I drive your car and you drive the truck since it just sits that way, I have a car to go to work and back home. us talk to your dad Bob up and I was like my dad always says no, well, I went to my dad he goes yeah that's fine I was like what you know, like that's crazy and i've learned a lot about my dad last 510 years. Being a silent Apps and he is had been my whole life, I actually have more of a heart like him than I do my mom because my dad is so understanding and chill about things that you think he's going to be not okay with. And so. But anyway. I tell her yeah he said it's fine and she literally was like okay. But you're paying the car payment and the insurance and I was like you're already paying for these things they're your cars. One just sits you're going to drive that instead like What do you mean how am I gonna say for a car, but. And I literally had to pay her $386 car payment and 300 a month for insurance at 16 years old, to go to work I That was all my money. And I remember our church people going you're paying the car payment of your parents car and back then you just think that's like oh okay there because that's what they told you."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"yeah and looking back now i'm like that is so fucked up there's so many fucked up stories like that there's so many like it did make me a very diligent strong you know person capable all that, but what would I have been if I had actually been supported. You know. holy Fuck i'd probably be you know. And it's like I remember one of my friends, who was three times my age, she was like dude Kevin everything you say how you are you think like. I got if you went to a really good school so young, you would have just been a brain surgeon, right now, you don't I mean like you just wonder, and I don't feel sad like oh boo hoo I not my potential i'm just saying damn I really wasn't. Truly cultivated and I was taught to survive yeah but I wasn't. There was no like. Safe peaceful. excited you know. That just wasn't there such a young age to have all that anxiety and fear. So it keeps coming up, then that makes sense, like I need to feel those emotions, you know."
298.0,Provider,"lily yeah actually makes me think of one of my favorite quotes by pema troll children, which is nothing ever goes away until it teaches us what we need to know."
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"So as much as we try to suppress and just you know bypass these these painful memories and emotions that come up the more that we do that, the more that they're just sitting inside of us."
11957.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I remember learning that at an early age, I felt a lot of intense pain and fear and. anxiety and I realized that you're fighting it go through it and I did, and I was Okay, and I learned from that you know, but it doesn't mean you always apply it, you don't know some of these things are back here doing things to you, you know what I mean."
298.0,Provider,"By having awareness, this is so important and I hear just so much self awareness, every time we talk Kevin you just have so much awareness like you talk and you give yourself the answers right."
11957.0,Patient,"yeah every time. A lot it's I think sometimes that's my like gift, but also a bad thing, because then like who do you go to for help you know. But. I think this is helping."
298.0,Provider,"me to see something that you need any answers, though, at this point, I think that. Your work is in. feeling and healing and just walking through this right now and allowing yourself to to verbalize or if you need to write them down, but whatever comes up for you Let it come up. don't push it down anymore."
11957.0,Patient,"yeah. Like I remember. it hit me that. The thing I cared about the most was the most toxic for me, which was my mom. And that can live in your brain when you love someone like that. But it was the truth. Being that close to her so long, was the most toxic fucking thing they ever going to happen to me. And and i'm not i'm not doing the blame game because that's pointless and I just, if anything, my first instinct is always to look at the person's situation and go. it's not about guilt or fault it's about who are they at the time, and how they were brought up raised what they knew didn't know capable skills, no skills coping whatever. And so, looking at that you just instantly have forgiveness, because you know that they weren't capable and they did what they thought or they did, out of fear or whatever. But it doesn't change what it did to you, you know."
298.0,Provider,Absolutely absolutely yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"and When it comes to my dad like. I know there's all these things are supposed to have roots and stuff but. He was just never he was never there, so I don't feel a loss, you know what I mean when you didn't have something you don't lose you don't feel like you didn't have it, and I know you're supposed to have two parents, but. it's important for a man to have a father, I know that but I almost feel like lucky, because who, I am as a person, I feel like I became that for myself and it's actually healthier, you know what I mean that would have been if I followed that way and. Because even now we talked and i'm like that you don't know what you're talking about, because you have no education and you're saying things that are in the stratosphere of. So conspiracy land CHA CHA because you have no way to decipher logic facts and rationale, because you don't know how you know. And so. i've learned to just love him for how he is because. that's who he is. You know, like I don't feel a loss, with him, I just feel like my dad's been 100% sure and and that's it all he does it's all he wants to do. he's been to my apartment twice my entire life once for for two hours and once for one hour. And he doesn't know how to be with a gay guy he doesn't know how to be with a gay son he didn't know how to when he did try was really. You know hard for him to do it, so the best way for him was to be absent, with my brother there like he was he wasn't that's what my parents divorced, he wasn't there for. Either of my mom just couldn't rectify with him because, for her for a mother seeing your two boys raised in the man's in the House and has zero to do with them that hurts her so I get. But I just never he was never an option so. I never relied on it or felt loss from it it's not like, I had a little love for my dad so I feel sad that I don't have nothing, it was a man who was there, you know what I mean. Like. And, most of the time I just was annoyed by this person everything. The way he. A few times woke us up for school was annoying how he did it was annoying the way he was annoying the fact that he had nothing in his brain was annoying and. And it was just hate anger and like annoyance and then later when I was an adult I was like oh yeah you're just the caveman you know, like you, can't help that your parents weren't there for you and. They were extreme old white ring white you know. Business owner absent strong religion just nuts, you know. So. Literally I have zero emotional response when it comes to him I don't feel loss at all. i'm sure they're supposed to be something and i've tried many times to think about it, and maybe it's blocked, maybe it's really, really blocks, but if it is i'm never going to get to it because I don't have any emotion about him I just really don't. But I did."
