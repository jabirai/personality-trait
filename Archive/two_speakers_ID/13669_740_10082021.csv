Just didn't I don't want this relationship and i've never been in a situation where i've been in love with someone like relationships ended and size and he follows me and it's just I don't know. So horrible."
740.0,Provider,"You want it, you want to talk about it."
13669.0,Patient,yeah. Okay i'm. Sorry i'm just trying to find a spot.
740.0,Provider,Well hey um.
13669.0,Patient,"yeah. he's I mean basically what happened is you know, he was like I can continue to be in a relationship with you, but I don't want to be, you know, and so I said Okay, and even though you know when when I started our relationship, when we first started seeing each other, it was. He was like polyamorous he's identifying as polyamorous um, I was interested in trying it and, but when the situation presented itself like there was someone who was interested in him and. It was at a party and I was there and I was like we've only been dating for a month and I just like I was just like I can't do this like."
740.0,Provider,I just.
13669.0,Patient,"can't and I told them, you know, at first, he was like this is, you know part of my identity like I can't you know I can't change myself, and I was like okay well and. And I you know, decided to we had a big issue with this specific girl, because he I mean, first of all meeting her at a party like I don't know why I was there and we've only been dating a month, I feel like you know we didn't establish very good boundaries with like. You know how that would work and then on top of it, you know he I mean I told him how uncomfortable I was with it and. And he you know sort of like backs off, and then we play in this big group that we have this big Bernie man community that we're both a part of, and you know I joined after him, he was in it for like a year or two before we met and. And so the brain and can they are so with our burning man Community it was like my birthday and our friend rob birthday, so we planned like the trip to these hot springs. And he, like inviting this girl, and I was just like are you kidding me like you he's like well I think should be really good fit for the group, and I was like I don't understand how you think. Okay yeah and so basically like she didn't end up coming I guess she just she couldn't come or something and so he never officially told her that she can come it just sort of works out that she. couldn't come, and then I went to Japan for a month and to paint murals and I decided, while I was there I was like I just can't do polyamory like I just can't do it, and like I basically came back and was just like. You know I understand this, this is something you need, but like I can't do this like I already just like felt such a deep attachment to him in a way that I had never felt really before I mean I know it was still new but we had a really deep like heart connection and. I basically was just like you know, and she you know me or her like or your lifestyle, or whatever you know, I was like I can't. And he decided to be monogamous with me, he was like I feel like you know you're you know our connection so special and like I said we're coming from and. You know, into the relationship after you know, a while he I felt like he was like at first, I was worried that he was just doing it for me, and it was like you know not gonna. be good and badly, but I was like it kind of just was like Well he decided to do this, and like I don't know so I kind of just try it out so think about it and. And then, like you know as our bond deepened and We grew closer and closer, I mean he was like. yeah sent me this article or basically was like you know there's a difference between polyamory and poly sexual and like you know i'm totally devoted to you and all this stuff and. You know I you know I love people, but I don't need to have sex with them, you know, I was you know happy to like there's this special bond between you and I. And you know which made me feel really good, and you know throughout our whole relationship, I mean I. I knew he was really devoted to me and I knew that you know, we had something really, really special and I don't know I just honestly think during coven like. I mean we were both you know we were both really social people, and you know it was just super super hard, I mean with our friend group, like nobody was hanging out and like. We basically are just in this warehouse together, I mean he he stopped going into his office, and he started working from home like he used to go to the Office like. You know and be gone all day and then come home so then we didn't have that separation anymore, and I mean honestly our relationship was so good, like we had enough space and like, but it was just so much pressure from the outside, and like I think you know I became extremely introverted. And I started using tons of ketamine basically to like you know get myself through the extreme pressure I was feeling around me because I felt like so much stress from. la and just where we were and all of the covered stuff I mean I felt trapped, you know and it felt like the only way that I could survive, but, honestly, I mean it. Did me such a disservice, because even though I was really productive and I, you know I did my entire painting my entire loft I like made so much art, but the thing is that it kept me and unhealthy situation because I was in delusion you know. Like I was basically thinking that you know my. thinking. It was just really. To be. Honest it like. Always. I always felt super connected to him I didn't feel like is this associating from him and like um but you know it was it was a problem, I mean I overdose or a couple times so that was really scary for him and scary for me and. yeah I don't know I just couldn't stop I just. I don't know I felt like it was the only thing keeping me going, you know. And even though it was. You know, it was getting more and more destructive like I felt like I needed it and. I don't know I just couldn't stop and. We went to we went to a haka for a month in May, and while we were there, like you know I didn't do any and. It was hard, because I don't know I still have these like underlying issues inside of me because I felt like. You know, I was continuing this pattern, and the current relationship, I was on where even though I was very productive and I was making lots of art like I wasn't. reaching out to companies and trying to make more money you know, I was just like living on employment and like honestly, he was subsidizing the rest of our living expenses, you know because I wouldn't have been able to afford it like. If it weren't for him, you know he works in marketing and like he was making good money and so he basically was like paying for our food and stuff and any extra stuff we needed and. But it started I think inside of me It made me feel really trapped and even though, like it was so generous of him I fell I my self esteem just felt like really low and. I just you know I just didn't feel like I had any self worth and I felt trapped, even though I knew I loved him so much, I was like I was so in love with him, but I, and I, I was just wrestling with the feeling, you know, and I knew I needed to like get. something to happen, but I didn't know how to do it, I felt really disempowered. And I just felt it felt trapped in the cycle and. Then there is this mutual friend of ours, I don't know if I told you this part already about the breakup but. There is a friend of ours at the brewery he him and I connected really fast and ended up spending all this time together and he actually is a drug dealer. And so you know him and I were like doing stuff together. He. commissioned me to do a mural for his place, and so, when we got back from what haka like I started painting this mural and you know. started doing kind of meet again and, like, I was doing it with him and, like every day, you know, I was going over there is doing it all day and like going inside hanging out with them and then like going back out and painting and just like back and forth back and forth like. And I don't know I felt like so so when we got back from hahaha. I already while we were in hock I was like super stressed out because I spent a year and a half renovating and painting this loft and turning it into an art piece, and I knew that. You know, we were going to leave and I felt so much attachment to the space, because it was literally like a year and a half of my life and, like, I thought that. I don't know it's just been so crazy it's like I just kept thinking like you know covidien end i'm going to be able to have a show like when's this going to happen and like it just wasn't happening, it just wasn't happening like. We got about and I just was so stressed out because I wanted to leave la but, like, I felt I felt trapped there. And um and we both wanted to leave and but you know we were going to do the Van life thing and then I started getting really stressed out about that because I was like what if I don't make money. painting murals and then a minivan with him and I start getting super depressed because that's what happens to me I get really depressed you."
740.0,Provider,Know yeah.
13669.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I I started like getting really, really stressed out about that and we got back from makkah and our leaseholder who had been gone for 11 months. So he's like the master lease holder of our warehouse and he's lived there for 15 years, and you know we basically we have a whole lot within the side there's like five loft so that is a huge huge growth like 10,000 square feet. And so I have like. Our own kitchen bathroom is like you know or an apartment. And we got back from walk and he he had been gone for 11 months, taking care of his mom we had very little contact with them and before he left, we were friends like mechanized to. cook food and share food with him all the time and, like you know he's had a lot of family tragedies and like he's just had a lot going on in his life and we were I was friends with him and he got when when we see each other again he served us the 60 day eviction notice. And so I just freaked out because I was just like at this point, you know i'd already been in so much pain for this attachment and now. This guy is just telling us, we have to leave, and I was like how like knows absolutely can't happen, and I wanted to fight it and MAC was like. He he would didn't want to fight it he wanted us to leave in 60 days and I was just like it's not enough time I don't have time to get my show together, I don't have enough time for. You know I just I just didn't feel like I have time I also felt like, how can this guy just push us out of this place that you know, not only do they spend all of my time he's ever even been up there and he's also an artist so fucked up. Basically, what happened is just Maya this other girl who we live with she's like a severe alcoholic and she was just sharing code got really, really bad and she was calling him all the time, all he was gone and just talking shit basically. And even though, like we weren't doing anything like literally MAC and I were just working all the time, like there was nothing going on like that was bad like we were paying around like. I don't know what the Fuck like it was just seriously just crazy like the only thing that happened there, there was something that happened that made her stop talking to. me and MAC and it was because one day the downstairs think exploded with raw sewage and in the place that we live like you know it's. A little bit cheaper than other places, because basically if anything happens, the people who own it they're like you have to take care of it like if this thing breaks or water water heater or whatever like we're expecting to pay for all that. And so we have a house funds in case there's any sort of emergency like that, so one morning the sink broke, and one of our housemates asked me to. You know, for the number of a plumber she called them and then she asked him, you know she asked me if I could be there to help them with the sink. So I was, and while I was there, helping him with the thing my I came in and she was totally drunk and she started trying to ask him questions about like how much. It would cost to build a bathroom or something and like. He basically was like you should just look this up because Google it because i'm being paid hourly like you're you know she's like you guys are paying the hourly and she was like who's paying that early as like we are like this is a kitchen sink in. The communal area and, like this is a safety hazard, you know, but like we didn't have time to like have a house meeting and discuss it, I mean it was like literally an emergency, you know. And the fuckin thing costs $100 to fix like it was like nothing like it wasn't even that much money and see she she freaked out and basically was like. She was like i'm not paying for this, so I went and founder in the park afterwards, and I was just like you know, we need to talk and she she basically was just like you still are home. You can't just make these decisions without consulting everybody and like she was just totally wasted and and I was like you're drunk as like i'm not talking to you and you're like this, and she was just like. And she just she's like i'm not drunk I only had four and she was like honor fucking another bottle and she's just it's like the middle of the day and it's ridiculous and i'm just like. All right, whatever i'm not talking to you like this and I just left her in the park and we haven't spoken sense. And so, basically, she hates me for that, and she blamed it on me, even though, like there were other housemates them all, she made this decision, for some reason I was my fault and I don't know I think she just she just was talking to Kevin are leaseholder like the entire time and, like. she's really shady so yeah that's that basically and so that's essentially why, which is crazy. I was like Why are you doing this and he's like I don't have to give you a reason which actually legally does, but he wouldn't give us a reason. He was just like it's just not working out and yeah it's just ridiculous, so I freaked out and then you know, I was painting a mural at the time of my friend's place and I just started doing like a lot of me, and I was just like. And, basically, I I felt like a fall in love with this friend of mine was paying for and. I had this big fight me. I weren't connecting in the way that I wanted to also he didn't want to do coming with me. And you know I felt like he was just associating for me and then basically our relationship blew up when I because I had been awake for two days during an art show and. There is a series of events, the things that he did that made me feel not seen and disrespected by him, and there were things that we definitely kind of work through, but I was just like another. And I just freaked out like I can be with you and I. My friend who I was doing the mural, for he was like, if you want to come and stay with me, you can get extra bedroom like you know, while you work stuff out, so I went to go service i'm for a week and I told my father's in the sky and I told. me."
740.0,Provider,you're on your phone breaking a really bad.
13669.0,Patient,same time my experience we're coming into figure all this out yeah sure for like a month that I use trying to. Tell me tell me when you can hear me is this any better.
740.0,Provider,yeah I can hear you.
13669.0,Patient,"Okay um. yeah so basically I just I don't know, I just want. This. ketamine does this thing where. it's like if you really good to like to like chicken therapy tool because it's like you could really self analyze but. I it taken him large amounts of basically makes you totally unable to see anything else, but your own perspectives, if you have not, I mean it's like it's like your ego just takes over. And that's like what happened to me is like I just couldn't. see anything else, I was just like I just I felt like they turned it to the person and but I didn't I still wasn't even really aware of it, and I just have doing more and more and. Finally, Max he got he ended up in the er because he got some medication, while you're gonna walk out and turn that was the wrong medication didn't realize it. And he ended up in the er and I was up North at my parents house, like all during the breakup and I freaked out it snapped me out of it, and I was just like oh my God like I love this person more than anybody like what am I doing. What am I doing like I can't it just snapped me back into reality and I stopped doing that, I mean and I went down to La to be with him and then I basically begged him to be with me again and. He at first was like no and then. And then he came around like Okay, you know I can be with you again. He. yeah he said, like you know we could be together here at this point, are they really make decisions in his life first things that he wanted to do like you know basically that he needed to travel by themselves."
740.0,Provider,broken up pretty bad.
13669.0,Patient,"So, and then you know all these things that each other. And, here again, but you know. How about. Any better yeah so um yeah so anyways um but you know, he told me that he didn't want to be in a monogamous relationship he had some big realizations about. yeah himself during this period of us being broken up that night he you know he felt like he just really needed to explore more sexually and he. Also. Like. Because he's Bisexual and he's."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
13669.0,Patient,"yeah okay. um yeah so he's you know he I knew before that he had attraction so men, but I didn't realize like what uh I guess him or I didn't realize the extent of. How he felt like that was part of his identity and so he feels like he needs to explore that on his own, and you know, like figure that out which thing that's been inside of him forever and which I totally get it's all fine. But you know polyamory is always been something that I realized was super hard for me, but I was like I feel you know I love them so much, and I think there's a side of me that just felt like. I was just like i'll do anything I just want to be with them again and I know just went into the state of like abandoned, like myself, and just basically like you know, whatever you want."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13669.0,Patient,"and So basically. i'm trying to wrap my head around you know doing this and really trying to get a relationship, when we were getting closer and closer and it felt like think you're really coming around it felt like we were. You know, really getting somewhere, and you know our bond was strengthening and he was you know, trusting me more and other stuff and this last weekend, she took me. To the up into the mountains, we were in and just like airbnb and it was so nice and like I said we had such a great time together, and you know he. I felt like we were good and then we got back on Sunday, this is just a few days ago. And he tells me once we get back to his place that he. picked up with this girl who was a mutual friend of her and she's like in our extended friend group she's not i've. met her a few times like you know he's no longer but it's not like we hang out with her and I got see whenever her place you're like a business meeting and they ended up hooking up. and probably of our Rules of polyamory was that whoever we are with that we are supposed to make it really clear to that person that. i'm and I were like primary partners and how serious relationship flows and he didn't tell her that. You didn't do that, and then on top of it, he does happen on Thursday we left on Friday, he waited until the weekend was over, to tell me about it. And she was like well, I thought, if I told you about it before we left that you would not want to go on this weekend trip with me. And that felt really manipulators chore for me, you know."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13669.0,Patient,"And I told him, but you know, I was like that really sucks and then he told me on top of it that he didn't tell her about our relationship, and I was like."
740.0,Provider,That it was really.
13669.0,Patient,"Bad right. And he said he was like well, I guess, I just assumed that she knew, because you know, we have all these mutual friends and stuff and I was like I don't care about what other people have maybe said to her like I care about you, having a conversation with this person and like. being honest and I, it was just so strange because I feel like he's always been really honest with me and he was totally dishonest and I felt like the whole situation was manipulative. And I told him that, and he felt really bad and you know, we had. This is all in the same evening, and you know we end up you know i'm really trying to like let this go and. Just you know, we decided that you know will be monogamous and so he leaves la which was going to be like the end of October, and you know just to work on our relationship, because I was like I don't think that we can do this, and so you and I are good, you know. Right, and you know he agreed he thought that that was a good idea and. Then he told me that he you know he really opened up to me and he told me to you know all about his the sexuality stuff and how you know shared really deep stuff with me and then he told me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. And how much she loves me, and you know. And then two days later he comes over and basically is like we can't I can't be with you. After he told me that. So. I don't know."
740.0,Provider,I.
13669.0,Patient,"Just I just feel so guilty, I saw a guy. He was so good to me in our relationship, and I know."
740.0,Provider,How did you mess it up i'm confused I had of this have anything to do with you.
13669.0,Patient,"Because when we we were before we broke up like I was one here is, you know."
740.0,Provider,"That has nothing to do what you call it, you can use that as a means to say with this why. Because he was the one who was the one who agreed to take you back. He was the one who agreed to try this again he was the one who agreed to see, we can move forward, you know i'm saying so my thing is, at the end of the day. You know, it has nothing to do with you, this is a decision that he made initially when y'all first got together, he said that that was a typo lifestyle that he wanted to leave. yeah right there was before, ending the breakups those before any of the mishap when your friends got together, you said, this is the lifestyle that I want to live. There you was like okay well let's try, but then you realize that you could so in order to do that, basically, what he did was he decided to. He decided to become a monogamous with you, but even though he decided to tell monogamous which you did doesn't mean that that he raised his desire of the lifestyle that he wants to live does that make sense. You know, there will be always in the back of his mind. There was a desire, just because he became exclusively with you then didn't erase the desire that he had the event may see."
13669.0,Patient,So it has nothing to do with you.
740.0,Provider,"It does so we're not going to do this you're not going to blame yourself or anything like that why because initially before yeah got together, the first time it was already spoken to discuss how he wanted to leave. And i'm going to do with you. Now what ah you're saying the fact that the fact that you decided, you know i'm saying, I mean the fact that he decided to become an island with you, it doesn't erase it doesn't erase the the the underlying the underlying desire that he hated. So. It has nothing to do with you. It has nothing to do with our I missed the first time that's why i'm here, for the sake of time. There has nothing to do with you, if somebody has a desire to do something, just because they're exclusively with you, it don't erase the underlining design, you would hope that he would write. You would hope that it would because you know. You with me so since you chose to be with me and then means that means the hopefully the desire is to be exclusively with me, you would hope. But that's not always the case we'll see."
13669.0,Patient,"I mean, I told them. I told him that I felt like you know. He. You know. He decided."
740.0,Provider,"You gotta stop you know, really. You were gonna rub it."
13669.0,Patient,In you know now I feel like we're back to.
740.0,Provider,"break it up is breaking up really, really, really, really, if you can hear me."
13669.0,Patient,is making a run of it. I I can hear you. there any way we can on my phone.
740.0,Provider,"I wish, no. No, I never turn your video off."
13669.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"yeah you probably do better like that. how's that. yeah that's better, but you said. You said I had that conversation, and what happened."
13669.0,Patient,"Well, I just felt like well yeah so what I asked. Or what I was feeling is that sense. I you know we're back at this place of him wanting to be polyamorous I was just like that makes me feel like in our whole relationship that you were suppressing something. Like why. You know, and that that wasn't really authentic to you, and he was. Like well when we were he was like well when we were together, I was really happy and it did feel really good to me and I was like well don't you think that this would have come out at some point anyways like. I can I also feel like during covert I mean we were in a bubble, you know, like. We were in you know him and I had talked about having you know sexual experiences with other people like together. And you know, no one wanted to even be in the same room as anybody it's not exactly a good time for like group sex, you know. Nobody nobody wants to be in the same room so it's like I don't know I cuz I I was like I feel way more comfortable doing something like that, with you because I feel like that's like a bonding experience versus like you go yeah for me going off and like sleeping someone else you know. Like that just felt a lot more separate to me and and so anyways That was something that him and I were like you know we could do this, but then you know code bed. And I don't know I mean I felt like our world just got really small and and you know that stuff was definitely not a possibility, and I think any sort of. dating at that time or going out with other people just seem totally impossible, so I think you know he probably just wasn't thinking about it at all, and then. You know now things are changing, and I know, so I just felt really bad I felt like you know I had been in a relationship with someone who is not totally honest with me. Right and he. told me that that wasn't the you know, he was really happy to be in the relationship, the way it was and that you know he's very he's very much like a shapeshifter but at the same time, I mean he's something he's really trying to do. So, like he feels like and I see this very clearly that he has some really deep codependency issues. i'm like he has been in partnerships, I mean he started dating really young and he's had girlfriends back to back. Like his entire adult life, I mean he started dating and like middle school. Like I mean he has he's like always had a girlfriend and you know and then his last girlfriend they decided to be polyamorous at the end of their relationship. because to me, you know I think I think the polyamory thing appeals to him, because he hasn't had you know time on his own to be to be sexually free you know because she's always been partnered. And I totally get that feeling like I I didn't you know I there are. times when you're trading partners, where I was like I definitely didn't want to be in partnership and I wanted you know, like he's 29 and i'm 36 or seven years longer places in our life like I don't feel. The need to like sexually explore the way he does like i've done a lot and I am really happy with like just being with a good partner who loves me and like you know just focusing on that person I mean like. I I don't know it has so much other stuff to think about I mean the thing about polyamory is it's like it's just it's like this whole just pandora's box into human drama. it's like it's just all about like yeah are you hurting this person is the communication right like I don't know it's just so much work. Like I don't want to spend all my time thinking about stuff and going up and down on an emotional rollercoaster like I mean any of the times that i've tried to do this stuff with him it's just been so emotional and like draining and it just takes up all my energy, you know."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13669.0,Patient,"And so anyways I just that's basically what's going on, and I just you know him and I both have never loved anybody, the way that we love each other and we're both still in love with each other, but he doesn't want to be partnered he wants to be you know doing his own thing and. He thinks that this is the best decision for him."
740.0,Provider,"Anything the thing about it this and I know i'm never going to discredit dated hurts, because I know we do, however, you will rather know now dances continue to be strong on."
13669.0,Patient,"yeah. Yes, it's true, I mean I was gonna ask him to marry me about a ring, and I was going to propose them."
740.0,Provider,"Remember, you told me that."
13669.0,Patient,yeah i'm so in love with you rather know.
740.0,Provider,"Then, to be embarrassed you know i'm saying they have to go through their whole process of you know your knee and all that kind of stuff and pros and cons to this and all of a sudden, the line when."
13669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"It is somebody to tell you what that's in bed that's even more embarrassing, so you rather know the truth and now."
13669.0,Patient,"they're my thing is like this, it has nothing to do with you."
740.0,Provider,"And so, get. Get that out of your head, it was already an issue initially faded y'all are seven years apart. So that means you leave a good portion of your life and he feel like he has not, so this death what it boils down to. period as nothing to do may have already done a deal for the first time again and do with it. Because. Something that he's built initially before I even got together."
13669.0,Patient,yeah so.
740.0,Provider,"The fact, they you know i'm saying and the thing about it is. It gets to the point to where yeah I don't miss out on this credit history to see you out of this great today, he was in love with you all to kind of stuff I believe those things were real, however. Sometimes you can deceive yourself and lie to yourself long enough to the point to where you realize, you know where i'm a regressive down the road if I continue in this direction."
13669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"or example of her down the road. If I continue this way because my thing is like this, whatever and if that's what i'm saying a eventually love becomes a choice if i've been feeling."
13669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"When we and we we continue the barcode feelings and we do things myself feeling feelings paid after wow or feelings change, you know i'm saying so you can feel one way, one day, and feel something else the next day."
13669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"that's why you don't do things off feelings you do things based off of choice. it's a hard decision that you make, and so a lot of times and I are, and you know I agree with you see it if you knew that this was something that was bothering you and you knew that this was something they will see a troubling you, you know i'm saying and yo it. mentally so. A on the inside, and they mean you shouldn't be real with me, and these are saying and then just led me down that. led me down the hallway but at least you know don't continue to string me along and I guess when y'all had a conversation a probably stroke their life will be him like you know when we can go ahead and be real."
13669.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean, he he definitely like. given to me in the beginning of our relationship, because he was first slide I really need to reply around us and other stuff and then, when I gave him an ultimatum he he said, you know I don't need yeah."
740.0,Provider,Exactly.
13669.0,Patient,"You were giving way. Right, he felt like was. To be."
740.0,Provider,"Running right. You gave him i'll. be there for. You i'm saying women got power like so you know okay what I didn't do what she what she wants me to do doesn't mean that's what. he's doing what he wants to do yeah i'm saying, and if that means to go on a road, so the. rat a rat around the country and available whatever whatever other things you're trying to do with his life. You i'm saying at the end of the day, you know i'm saying, if he gave in to your ultimatum That means, ultimately, ultimately, he neglected when he wanted and his choices and his decision his life goals in his life dreams that are they kind of stuff and so you're saying eventually. You know there's my main just because he stayed with you that that means again without things went away, they did not go away and so that eliminates a you the call it an effort, and if you give me you don't give them the ultimatum you let them go the way they need to go. If they want to go you let them go away. One in a wash because the end of the day, me and they say what you under false pretenses."
13669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"If that's the way they tried to go and you're not trying to go away that's why all right, well, I appreciate you so much, you know, maybe we'll cross paths down the road. But don't give no more automated."
13669.0,Patient,But.
740.0,Provider,"What happens is, will you saw I gave an ultimatum. Then, that means that the person does not genuinely choose you for you, they just choosing you because of the fact that you force them to."

Just if that's if a person present okay with this is this is me, and this is what I like to do, and this is big and if you don't agree with it that's fine. that's. Just me difference is that the all the person in the world that you would like their person is not the all the person in the world, that you will connect with."
13669.0,Patient,"him and I had I don't know i've never had like a heart connection with someone before I mean if I had. Other long relationships several and longer like my last boy from for him and I read together for five and a half years. And, but he he became very disassociated he was an alcoholic and like he just started I don't know he started really checking out like At first I. I will just never experienced alcoholism on that level and i'm just didn't understand like how to sharpen it would be in a relationship, because when we met, I mean he was like. 26, I think, and I he's a lot younger than me to two and a half years much MAC but you know he he was like. You know, we met at burning man and they're mean at burning man there's like a lot of substance abuse and drinking and I don't know I just I didn't think anything of it, and then we and i've had my own issues with substances, obviously. um and. Like before Kevin me show me more I have anxiety issues and that's like but you know I used to drink and do. You know I would do stuff like that. you're."

Like wall, who is working, you know drinking like you know you from a rich family and kiss your guy bottles of champagne or to go to Japan, but uh. yeah yeah he would drink you drink all day and now i'm like I bet you never got violent or anything like that he just I don't know he didn't really it didn't really seem, I guess, I just didn't say much. Thank you. huge problem, because he was very listen understand what a functional alcoholic was you know I didn't know he still it's still felt like felt like he became more and more disconnected to me, he was numbing himself out and also my main himself to me. And then you know his mom and his sister also like serious alcoholics and it just became like a huge huge problem and. So I you know I went to India, and when I came back after five months of traveling and backpacking and painting murals like he his whole family was like super shitty to me and. And he was mad at me and I ended up cheating on him with back and that's how I ended up in the relationship with MAC and so i've basically been in a partnership with you know from Ryan to MAC for eight years. So I had I went straight into another relationship, you know which I felt like I would never do, but I really love it if not. You know I felt like Ryan had just been ignoring me, and you know I, and then I also had traveled by myself for eight months, and so I felt like I had some separation from him and it didn't seem like I was just. Totally you know one man to the next, but obviously I was still in a relationship with Ryan, but I don't know it just I sort of rationalized in my head. But uh I felt like you know after Ryan, I mean I I actually wanted to be single and travel more and I ended up in a relationship with MAC so I also compromise, you know myself. as well, I wanted to do is travel. to South America. And I didn't do it, I stayed in La with MAC and decided he wanted to continue working at the tech company, he was working at and. Then you know him and I made the plan to do in life, and we were like you know, whenever that's you know the right time we're going to do it and we decided that pretty early in our relationship and then yeah. So we've been we've been compromised ourselves to be together."

You know ulterior motive and other kind of stuff like you will have to go through out it, you know i'm saying. yeah not one is real.
