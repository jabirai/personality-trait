14039.0,Patient,And then they go and you're like you know there's a couple of days like what are you talking about there's nothing why.
214.0,Provider,"So until we're ready and open to understanding maintenance, whether it's treatment or other things we, we have to say, you know what we should try it let's see it could be a benefit, and then you know it opens up our life alright have others around you notice the changes."
14039.0,Patient,Oh yeah they like it better.
214.0,Provider,"Well, I would. Like it better to."
14039.0,Patient,"check yeah you know i'm not out there anymore, you know i'm not trying to chase this evil evil drug that that causes me to spend more time on it in my own family."
214.0,Provider,"I know I know you know what suddenly that that's that's like the Aha moment you know I use the analogy of you know dog and tail, and I say at the point of addiction is the tail wagging the dog the dog no longer could control the tail. ramen and and and you know at that point we're just maintaining, because if we don't get sick just doesn't. It ain't right no more so we're maintaining not being sick it's no more the enjoyment, or the fulfillment is just like it's a bad chase so now we've changed direction, now the dog is wagging the tail again and then that's the way we should be okay."
14039.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Alright, see surveys and we're all done you uranus are all done just if you can keep doing that that would be marvelous."
14039.0,Patient,"Okay, no problem."
214.0,Provider,"yeah so we saw each other twice, so what, what do you think you, what do you think some of the stresses, are they like. Create being uncomfortable."
14039.0,Patient,"well. Stresses like like me, like me, my biggest stress and make. smarter."
214.0,Provider,"More in general, no, no, it for you, because listen, it is we all are built different in anything that may bother you may not bother me and vice versa, but. it's not about me and it's about okay so where's the manage ability what, how do we, how do we get gain control of it. and be able to manage it versus it becoming you know overwhelming and catastrophic and that's usually what happens, things are like oh my God, this is crazy I don't know what i'm gonna do, and before you know it it's out of control, so what is that for you like."
14039.0,Patient,"Oh, see well. When I feel like when it feels like i'm getting all stressed out in like it's out of control. Really hasn't been that bad for me here, you know, since i've got my biggest stress in my life was my addiction. i'm not a good."
214.0,Provider,"That was now that now that you don't. have that. That sometimes is avoid it's like oh shit now, what do I do with myself, I was preoccupied 24 hours a day figuring this out now I don't have to figure it out, I. My body wants to be active and wants to do something and just having like nothing to do nothing not watching grandkids but that's something different, but the body's searching for that, like. hey like yeah."
14039.0,Patient,"Out there yeah that's why I will admit i'm always doing something if whether it's taking my grandbaby and I i'm with my grandbabies a lot. I enjoy that I need to keep busy. To keep my mind. Sure, oh cuz like I remember a person telling me this one time it took me a long time to figure it out, but I finally figured it out, he said that the idle hands is the devil's playground."
214.0,Provider,It is.
14039.0,Patient,"And I finally figured that out because, once you get bored or nothing to do that the mind starts well shit i'm getting high and i'm not bored no more. You know, so I I keep myself so busy i'm taking taking them to the parks, but you know I didn't realize how much I missed out and how much fun that really is, you know what I mean. That I missed out and that they missed out. On it having their grandma because you know, I have a grandson that's 13."
214.0,Provider,While.
14039.0,Patient,You know and i'm just not that next 12 years I can't get back with them.
214.0,Provider,"But, but before you go into the guilt roll through this what was, is no longer. I can't I can't stop working out today for the marathon for next week, no matter how hard, I tried to make this up can't do it, what I can do. Is give so much of myself more today than I could have like you've got to give yourself accolades because you know the should have what it could is it's never healthy I know we do it, but the reality is what was yesterday's no longer today and what today is, I really love it."
14039.0,Patient,Right can't do nothing about yesterday.
214.0,Provider,"Can, but you can do about today."
14039.0,Patient,Right right right that's good.
214.0,Provider,"stay in the moment of you know today because. You know. By can't live in yesterday can live in tomorrow, but you can live in today so embrace that for yourself because."
14039.0,Patient,I lost it.
214.0,Provider,"yeah often enough, we were in the rearview mirror too much."
14039.0,Patient,"And like that, so that makes sense because you're right, you know what there's nothing we can do about."
214.0,Provider,And you can cry about it all day and you could be pissed about it all day and damn it's only.
14039.0,Patient,"going to come in, tomorrow you know so work on to work off right."
214.0,Provider,"Work on all those things you want to do today, before you go to bed, you can start thinking about what you're going to do tomorrow, but you can't do anything about yesterday, but the fact is, you are doing, somebody yesterday because you're different today."

214.0,Provider,It is.
14039.0,Patient,"it's so much easier, but."
214.0,Provider,"You know, when we when we cross that threshold it's not that they're not important to us that threshold makes us focus somewhere else. that's really what happens you. know one not no one doesn't not want to be responsible that's just that's not true, the problem is that the threshold tells us this has to be first. And I get it, but at some point, you know we have to say i'm tired of the tail thing i've got to get control the tail right, and I think that's what you wanted did so embrace that that that that change of view the transparency, like you know what. I ain't got the semi normal i've got to do something else and that's what you want, in did."
