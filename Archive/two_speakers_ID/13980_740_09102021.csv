13980.0,Patient,Because now i'm suicidal doesn't mean. i'm homicidal.

13980.0,Patient,"I know that's when I started treatment it's not a. it's not a pressing thing.

740.0,Provider,lot.
13980.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's not a big deal it's just.

13980.0,Patient,"yeah I know, but just I just love how."
740.0,Provider,"Well, the thing about it is, is that you only basically come to see me twice a month right the sessions don't have to be an hour long they can be 30 minutes. Okay right. Because the thing about it is, is that and I try to encourage clients all the time that, even with the medication you still got to do some work you have to know how to cope and manage you know i'm saying, because what happens. You know if the if you feel like you need a higher dose which you gotta wait or You ran out or You ran out of medication and you had to wait for refill. ya know you have to be able to cope. You know i'm saying and and use those coping mechanisms to be able to live to live a productive life, even if you're on meds are off does that make sense. yeah so that's what i'm gonna do. Okay doesn't matter."
13980.0,Patient,All right.
740.0,Provider,"Okay i'm not gonna say for nobody's told for for those 15 years of therapy that you did. Hopefully, I will be able to just add to. yeah I do so, so save you a little bit about growing up what was your family life life."

740.0,Provider,"Okay, and so. was your treatment 15 years ago is that when everything kind of started when you were first that I know and all that kind of stuff."
13980.0,Patient,yeah I had a suicide attempt it was right when I was 14. So right. Brain starts to kind of really mature into what when depression starts warden illness showed itself so that's when I started. treatment for depression and ADHD and then eventually anxiety and then I went off the anxiety meds because you can't take them long term.
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So I see here that you said that you consider your depression, to be well controlled and your anxiety of only slightly control."
13980.0,Patient,"um yeah because I don't have any medication for it. So so it's obviously better control what the medication, but I do understand that it's it's really bad for you to take long term. it's not a good solution."
740.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's true. So we demand trauma know abuse neglect know eating disorders, no hallucination."

13980.0,Patient,I know yeah I know.
740.0,Provider,"i'm like you talking like you use i'm going to rely on oh. Now I mean we're cordial but I don't have a good relationship with what I do live with them. yeah that's true me off, maybe we will lose. Larry if I ever had a good laugh all day that."
13980.0,Patient,"was their roommates. To be honest, it's it's been good for me to at least like examine my relationship with them as an."
740.0,Provider,Adult yes.
13980.0,Patient,"It was leaving like a whole and me. yeah he's a whole, and both my sisters, because they no longer communicate with my parents."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so Lisa you've been able to heal and kind of rectify those issues a little bit. yeah that's good that's always that's always good, because you don't want to. For them to pass and then for you to be still holding on to things we've been made."
13980.0,Patient,"yeah I agree. That, at that point it's only affecting me."
740.0,Provider,Right after the. Video but what was cool like for you.
13980.0,Patient,"I did pretty well in school up until I mean, I still did pretty well and I struggle with ADHD in high school probably I probably had in my entire life, but just wasn't. Parents didn't really believe in mental health services, even though it runs in my family, they just don't believe that it was kind of like not in my house don't get mental health treatment. So it kind of went on done. Or, while until it hit a breaking point with a suicide attempt, and then they're like well, I guess, going to fucking kill yourself."
740.0,Provider,"Any learning disabilities and ADHD What did you have any learning disabilities with it. No, did you complete your hospital. Any college at all. yeah you can play with so. yeah good. weather so growing up were there any events this that out to you like, either in your neighborhood amongst your friends like what kind of neighborhood would you live in what kind of dynamic worth it wasn't a good place to. be raised and how was your frame did your frame with a positive peer pressure you into anything so forth, though."
13980.0,Patient,"I mean yeah I grew up in supposedly like the safest town in the United States, so it's like one of those places that like i'm the appearances are really important so The thing is, you know, on the surface really good and then you don't really talk about actual problems."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, because of the family name didn't want to be thinking, the past. We got a reputation to uphold."
13980.0,Patient,"yeah, of course."
740.0,Provider,"The same thing. So did you ever serve in the military. And do you have so i'm going to ask you this question, even though I read it already, but I want to see, I want to hear your response. If they want to your stressors is finding. Okay, so, can you tell me more about it."
13980.0,Patient,Oh i'd like to be able to support myself like fully.
740.0,Provider,And it's difficult to do.
13980.0,Patient,It a high cost of living area.
740.0,Provider,"And you live, you live in California right."
13980.0,Patient,yeah. And i'm pretty lucky so that's also kind of. yeah.
740.0,Provider,"well. You stressed out about it, I mean so it's one thing to stress out about it, and I understand California prices is ridiculous let's. bless bless your heart. And therefore, a lot of Californians are moving to Texas, thank you."
13980.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"um but uh so I know the cost of living is is high. But I guess, my question is, why do you feel the push to move, do you feel like your parents are pushing you to get out do you feel like you need to get out because you're all."
13980.0,Patient,"I feel like my life stops a little bit as in progress, the way it should have been like my daughter, because you know I feel like it's like a child."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so is there a third thing is being able to work and save up the money to be able to move out or."
13980.0,Patient,"it's it's kind of an option, basically, I need a I need a better job and it's hard to pursue that with having depression."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13980.0,Patient,But um that's basically just the just have any the Tropic can support me.
740.0,Provider,But you said you are the person who control.
13980.0,Patient,It is but it's always there.
740.0,Provider,Like a food. yeah which one do we do we pick the person that would be that would be like.
13980.0,Patient,"Do we have a choice. Absolutely, I mean I don't I feel like I would never pick depression that I mean, in some ways I probably do."
740.0,Provider,"Well, I see that's a revelation yeah right, I mean I mean yeah there's a there's a choice you i'm saying the same when you have traumatic situations even constantly be haunted by your trauma or you can just choose the lay of the side of it. yeah you know i'm saying and so saying assign different just because it will manage it will be different it's major if it's severe you don't have any kind of medication know kind of support, no inhibitions whatsoever to help manifest depression, but. per your reports, it is will maintain is managed, because you have the proper medication. Right, so what thought since finances is such a stressor you said, the one of the things that you do as part of your coping skill is keeping yourself busy to avoid stress and doing routine and your major support system is your friends. So. Since finance with such a big thing when when do we do."
13980.0,Patient,pursue better opportunities.
740.0,Provider,Is that an option for me some realistic favorite something that you can fit it to be like a realistic option. That you can do.
13980.0,Patient,I mean. I could. make my living situation I don't know you can rent like a couch in someone's house for $700 a month.
740.0,Provider,"Well, why would you want to leave mom and dad."
13980.0,Patient,be a because there's not a great environment.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's not Okay, so when you said, not a great environment with me."
13980.0,Patient,"it's just I mean don't you think it's weird that I don't have a good relationship with them and I live with them, I mean."
740.0,Provider,"I mean, we call on. yeah it's different if they add if they add to your depression or they make you anxious. is different, if they fit your emotional stress. Or if they add to your hardships like it's different if it's like an abusive environment like isn't neglectful like folks to hear person is living and so on and so for week moping and doing all this kind of stuff. You know i'm saying is different if you're in a toxic or hostile environment they're basically a to your the basic basically damages your mental health. yeah is that the case."
13980.0,Patient,"So I it's it's not currently a toxic environment, however, it was my was a child, and I can't really separate."
740.0,Provider,To go.
13980.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So so that's the thing and that's why you telling me he dreaming is, let me know team. around me I haven't made. It. Yes, because there is a difference between the two and what's The thing is, is that what happens. Is a lot of times if we don't deal with those traumatic issues as a child, then they'll roll over in four adults. yeah, and so this was singing fight has happened, and the crazy part about that is medicine don't feed them."
13980.0,Patient,"Oh, I know."
740.0,Provider,"So that's why i'm, just as you have you ever say damn with their parents to actually vocalize the traumatic experience how it felt how how you say it, how it impacted you emotionally."
13980.0,Patient,"yeah well. they're they're saying is they, like to recreate reality. hmm so it did they kind of denied anything happens. Okay, and it's difficult to to sit down with someone then for them to say that didn't happen it did. It feels like i'm lying or something so that's not really completely an option, especially if I live with them that's going to open up a word it's not going to really be closed."
740.0,Provider,"Well, if that's not an option, I can tell you what is an option. because sometimes and, believe it or not, sometimes we have parents who did not be a part of reality. Yes, because because they know it wasn't an ideal situation, so people can suppress and an egg like it never happened. Especially if they don't know how to respond to it. yeah you're saying so, with That being said. My thing is is. If you have nowhere to go. Is that for me thing for you to stay there, what are your option."
13980.0,Patient,yeah well my options would be to you know get an apartment somewhere and just take on extra money. And it would just be like a less than ideal living situation cramps I guess.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, what a mid summer."
13980.0,Patient,"Oh, I mean I do extra like door dash and stuff like that."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
13980.0,Patient,I have enough money technically to move out.
740.0,Provider,Okay.
13980.0,Patient,"I guess i'm comfortable in some ways, though."
740.0,Provider,"comfortable amongst people you don't like. But see the thing about it is, if I can, if I can just. say this. yeah the thing about it is, is that is that you have been able to. avoid. Is a boy Now I want to avoid you've been able to overcome your negative feelings towards your parents. So they. Basically, you can have something convenient for all communities living. So if you can do that, to live in a comfortable environment. Imagine what else you can do."
13980.0,Patient,Right yeah that seems like a big compromise to me. yeah. yeah.
740.0,Provider,If you have mathematic but what you think you don't every day we live in today.
13980.0,Patient,"So i'm giving them validation that nothing happened in our childhood, because my presence makes them think that they work, the parents."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, there you address how you feel."
13980.0,Patient,that's how it feels well because they don't there are other kids won't talk to them.
740.0,Provider,What I.
13980.0,Patient,Will they haven't spoken like my oldest sister haven't spoken to them in like six years.
740.0,Provider,But I mean you got to follow.
13980.0,Patient,It means like i've what.
740.0,Provider,That means you got to follow. yeah Muslim faith everything in me and i'm gonna get on the bandwagon i'll follow right.
13980.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So when when do we choose. Our mental health. When do we choose those things. Even when they don't even, even if they never say i'm sorry."
13980.0,Patient,yeah well it's easy looking at them as old down because they look like well they looked horrible. yeah so it's like Am I gonna bring this up now like when it feels like i'm yelling at like elderly people. Because that's what it feels like it feels like they're not strong enough to defend themselves now.
740.0,Provider,"Well, one option that you can do instead of actually talking about it, you can write a letter."
13980.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. My mom is really good at writing really nasty letters, so that makes. me nervous."
740.0,Provider,"mom saying you can literally write a letter and then, once you finish writing the letter, then you can choose whether or not, if it's worth giving it to them, or is it worth leaving it all on the paper. yeah and let me go and burn it."
13980.0,Patient,Just.
740.0,Provider,"But at least you were able to release is somehow is not good for each to just stay inside right it's unhealthy for us to be suppressed. it's unhealthy for us to stay inside right, and so we have an option Abraham Lincoln asked about Abraham Lincoln used to always say the one of the ways that he would be able to heal from his anger was that he will write it down. Here write down how he felt in regards to whatever the situation was I made him angry and then instead of actually spending this as a person, it was it was a moment where you question is you're really working."
13980.0,Patient,yeah it's like when you. grow up and it's least see them as an adult and it's like is this worth it now.
740.0,Provider,"it's one of those type of things for you it's one of those things you have to ask yourself like your life is it really worth it, to try to bring up these day alone. Or do I just and see that's the thing because of the fact that it is something that still bothers you right then maybe an outlet could be to actually write it down. yeah, and I mean don't leave men that I mean I mean write it down write every piece, how it affected you what you thought about it, how it impacted you how it hurts, you have roku spirits, how you felt this way you felt this way and how it, how it affected you as an adult. yeah don't leave nothing now."
13980.0,Patient,I don't remember huge chunks of it. What i'm reading the parts that I know remember the worst parts of it.
740.0,Provider,"Well you'd be surprised, the more you write them down the more you. can make your memory. It says when you write you use both sides of your brain. yeah so you'd be surprised i've had people who have written out their life story. And when they begin to write it out, they was like oh my gosh I didn't realize, I thought I forgot about that, and when I was when. I started to remember this and I thought I forgot about it, I forgot it ever happen because the thing about it is the paper is a good place to put it, because the paper doesn't talk back. It doesn't judge you neither does it continue, the only thing that the Paper does is that it is listen to what you have to say."
13980.0,Patient,"No, I agree."
740.0,Provider,And so maybe there's something that we need to do. And just kind of Take your time and I made only know that. i'm nothing.
13980.0,Patient,that's gonna be something that I have to do over in chunks. Yes. yeah.
740.0,Provider,counties but. It is my duty as mom.
13980.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"um it just something you know, maybe it's something that we can even write it out and then something that we can. The last thing I want you to write in debt, I want you to write. What a healed version of view looks like I want you to make a statement to yourself to tell yourself. How I plan to overcome this how I plan, not to allow this to tear it to no longer tear me down, I will no longer allowed this to shape my identity, I will no longer allowed this to haunt me, I want to be able to make those kind of declarations to yourself. Because the thing about it is we can change people. Neither can we forced them to say something or say or to apologize for something they refused to volunteer for. But the last thing I wanted to do. Free The last thing I want you to have to go through is that contains to allow something to a level of trauma from your childhood to hold you hostage and your prayer."
13980.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Because my thing is, you know i'm saying, I know that you harbor a lot of things."
13980.0,Patient,yeah but i'm responsible for my own treatment.
740.0,Provider,"yeah but at the same time. You have a lot of things. But it's a fact, but when I say you have a lot of saying is because of the fact that many times, we can harbor thing, because we have unanswered question. Right and the crazy part about it is, is that we may never get an."
13980.0,Patient,Answer yeah. I doubt that I will.
740.0,Provider,"yeah and so that's when you learn to forgive for your own sanity now for their sake it's for your own sanity but your own peace of mind. yeah does that make sense. You can run from it all you want, but guess what it's all falling and I go on."
13980.0,Patient,my mind is I don't want to do that.
740.0,Provider,"Because you can move move, and you can work over. The door dash food eat Amazon, you can do all that kind of stuff it's important. To get those don't happen. When you move on move which. And he's gonna like what I found moving with answer no that's how running it's the best. Answer how it is one of those days later, we can focus on one sister doing, we can focus on what your other services doing this, the individual thing this the individual decision yeah i'm saying and the thing about it is you have been put in a in a position to where. Despite my lack of your parents, you need Japan."
13980.0,Patient,Yes. i'm trying to think of it's more of a self sabotage situation. Because I could probably I mean I could actually probably do it without them. That there's it's. kind of feels like i'm sabotaging myself. In some ways.
740.0,Provider,Now what's the solution.
13980.0,Patient,I mean to acknowledge that.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and once I acknowledge it then, what do I do."
13980.0,Patient,change it.
740.0,Provider,How you going to that.
13980.0,Patient,well. To like I mean I to to write down my mom I guess. yeah and then make physical moves.
740.0,Provider,"And then right, am I once you write it down and once you put it out, once you put it all out there on paper and once you write it down is like okay. Well now, you know now, what do I do with this information now you say what's this do I take moving forward and that's something that we would decide together once you finish I guarantee okay. As long as i'm not dead, and you still alive, then, once you finish writing a paper right like you doing a masters of fine. What she is writing writing day. yeah then it's something that we can talk about indecisive together every loss of which one to do moving forward. Okay. Let me go. See you said you didn't need dream."
13980.0,Patient,want to do it. yeah.
740.0,Provider,"But you got to the heel. Oh, you make it easy you want to stay broken, or you want to be whole. thing is, it is, it has been a pleasure, I look. forward to it so much. And is there anything else you want to add or anything else you would like to talk about."
13980.0,Patient,I don't think so.
740.0,Provider,I know you like oh we'll. Be right there.
13980.0,Patient,"I liked it the directness actually. Seen have you seen flatbush misdemeanors on HBO there's a therapist that's. exactly like you, she."
740.0,Provider,yeah yeah what a privilege.
13980.0,Patient,yeah.
