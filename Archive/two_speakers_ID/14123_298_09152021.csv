298.0,Provider,"it's thoughtful of you to say that, thank you."
14123.0,Patient,Well it's true.
298.0,Provider,How can I help you.
14123.0,Patient,"So basically I so you know nurse Isaiah has been my miners and he prescribed medication. I wanted to tell him, and so I am glad, I can tell you that, basically, he prescribed me wellbutrin which I had had been on before for depression, which kind of worked for my depression. But he also did prescribed me add a fan. For panic attacks, but the reality and what i'm realizing is."
298.0,Provider,"i'm i'm not hearing you i've lost you let's cut our feed, so I can just listen to you. let's get our videos so I can just listen to you so. What I did not get to hear was the reality and then you cut out."
14123.0,Patient,"Oh, can you hear me now."
298.0,Provider,I can hear you perfectly.
14123.0,Patient,"Okay, great good idea so we'll the reality for me is that I actually have I would say pretty severe general anxiety disorder. Where it like my anxiety makes me freeze. And like pretty non functional. And I think that my depression was caused by my anxiety. i'm currently looking for jobs, right now, and honestly every day i'm just feeling overwhelmed and i've kind of stopped looking. And it's just my anxiety has just really affected my day to day, and so I would rather let so I just wanted to let you know as a bit of a context. nursing say I had originally prescribed me so loft. But I had a really bad reaction to that and it turned into like extreme panic. So we discontinued that. And so after that I should have asked him to do what i'm basically asking you, which is, I want to try another anti anxiety like lexapro. But instead what you know he gave me was wellbutrin and add a van but the reality is I don't want to take out a van every day being that it's a benzo because i'm not having panic attacks, every day, I actually just want medication to have every day to treat my like daily high anxiety."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you ever tried lexapro before."
14123.0,Patient,I haven't tried lexapro before.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm happy to give you some lexapro did you guys discuss boo sperone also."
14123.0,Patient,We we didn't discuss that no.
298.0,Provider,Okay i'm just throwing that out there i'm gonna so i'm gonna put you on lexapro and take you off of wellbutrin Am I understanding that correctly or would you like to be on both of them.
14123.0,Patient,"I think I would like to be on both of them just because at this point, I have extreme anxiety, but I also am. depressed pretty depressed so."
298.0,Provider,hey.
14123.0,Patient,"I do feel the I mean unless you think it's like the reality is before i've i've i've actually had like major depression and the wellbutrin like kind of kicked it out to. Like be manageable, so I know that i've had experienced success with wellbutrin the reality, though, is like I have such bad anxiety and I know that i've had it because. I had a lot of sustained childhood trauma from when I was five to 18 that I really think of the last few years has like crept back up and turned into just extreme anxiety and feelings of overwhelm. At basically everything which doesn't even make I mean if I want to say it doesn't make sense, given that. Given that i've just you know i've been like i've overcome challenges before, but what i'm realizing is, I think, just now, especially now. In these last couple years, like all of the trauma and ptsd from my past is like prepped up and like. Definitely manifested into like I just honestly have extreme anxiety and panic and right now i'm staying with my friend, like pretty i'm literally sitting at my friends, because I yeah I am too anxious to."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I love the idea of doing lexapro I started it at five milligrams, which is a very small dose and i'd like you to take that for five days. If you don't have side effects. Okay, and you can. Take two tablets at 10 milligrams for two weeks, and this is a serotonin replacement when we get serotonin bad slip calm, that is what treats ptsd. And calms the body down. Now, as far as. Other medications that are. not as strong as out of town. I suggest you look up boost par be you as a PA are."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay, I just don't even honestly once I realized like how dangerous advantage because, like what I was explaining to nurse I say in the last. meeting was like i'll just have really extreme anxiety and that can turn into panic attacks, but I don't want to use an event every day to treat my consistent anxiety I don't even want it, you know to."
298.0,Provider,"I hear you and I am all for the least amount of out of them, that you can possibly need. So um so let's go with lexapro I am covering, and I say as patients for the next two weeks. So if you need to be seen again. And you want to look up boost par. i'd be happy. To have that discussion with you."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay i'm I would thank you so much again. chantelle like you're really like I was feeling honestly super anxious, the entire day and like getting more and more anxious. And like I would literally on the. On on on bright health for two and a half hours a day around eight different people trying to get an appointment, so I really appreciate you for doing this, what i'm really hoping is that i'll only like need the lexapro and the wellbutrin I I honestly."
298.0,Provider,"I hope, so I hope so. And i'm also making it a little easier for you and I gave you my email that if you need a direct contact to me, you can use that."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay Thank you so much, and one thing I wanted to mention is. I have been like. I have only been on the wellbutrin. For I would say a couple of days now, and I haven't experienced any negative side effects and what I really do want to do is like start taking a little beach and and lexapro at the five milligrams do you think that's okay to do."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, absolutely well the Tutoring works on dope I mean now there's no bad interaction between the two."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay, I actually know a couple of my friends that are out on both well beach and lexapro and they said it, they say it works really well for them."
298.0,Provider,"It does it does it's an amazing combination. It may. You know, it may need the the year on both are starting docents and it takes time, but hopefully you know we can get you to a more therapeutic dose and get it so you're not frozen when your anxiety goes up."
14123.0,Patient,"Thank you so much chantelle because the reality is I have been so frozen and just in like. Panic that I have lit like i'm not kidding I I was I like a couple months ago I I you know was living by myself in a room with with roommates. But I couldn't even handle that anymore, because I was so frozen I you know I have perfectionist tendencies, but also like a lot of trauma and the anxiety is literally got it so when I even received an email I avoided like I freeze so i'm really, really thankful to you. hey i'm hoping, this goes away."
298.0,Provider,I need so. If you're if you're one person who likes to research things look at trauma responses and what you're freezing is is a trauma response yeah yeah.
14123.0,Patient,"it's been really bad at work to like I don't have a job right now i'm actually. looking for a job and it's really affect I mean affected even my ability to apply to jobs, but I do remember it just started a couple years ago, but I, you know, had some much trauma and ptsd that I would freeze i've even typing an email."
298.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I understand I understand all right, Linda I will talk to you later, thank you for seeing me."
