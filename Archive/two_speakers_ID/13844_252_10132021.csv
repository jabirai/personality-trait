252.0,Provider,"You really don't you know you need to rest and focus on what's at hand, and you know we do it with respect we don't do it out of disrespect we do it because that's how rest and focus. So that's what I would suggest."
13844.0,Patient,"Definitely, you know. yeah."
252.0,Provider,Just some silence.
13844.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going to do that yeah i'm gonna try to go I haven't been outside today so i'm going to try to go outside just even for briefly. yeah so. yeah so I just and I like need to talk to my boyfriend about because I like he's not a Christian and like it wasn't really an issue like when we started dating because I was like I don't know how long i'm going to you know this, I don't know if this will work or not so. I didn't like exclusively you know, because my Church is very adamant about like you have today Christian because, like you know your values are the same like you have similar values in life and similar visions from like blah blah so like at first like. Like I was like I didn't understand it, so I was like it's fine whatever so I didn't really like. Like only exclusively a Christian I don't like whatever I mean whatever and then I met like see my my boyfriend right now, and like like faith it wasn't really like didn't really come up so i'll just say whatever it's fine. But then like lately i've been like thinking about it, for one, I like settle down so like I do want to know, like what he wants in life, and like. Like as a Christian is like I know what my purpose in life is, and I know how i'm supposed to be living in my life, but like I don't know what like we never really talked about. Like in the future what's going to happen and like I like don't want to force them to go to church um. So I never told him that, like you know my Church is like really against like me dating do because I didn't want him to like he already like has a bias against religion, so I didn't want to you know. yeah like add on us so, but then lately I just like thinking about our future like I do need to know like if you're going to be against like my faith and that's going to be an issue down the line, so I like need to talk to him, but i'm like wait till my exams over as you say. You know, things are, I was just like there are things hmi but i'm just like pushing everything to take my exam and. deal with the later. But then, like my my soul my Christian friends they're like you know it's your fault for not being like persistent like. You know, in the beginning, like pick dating only Christian and like you chose to date, a non believer like that's your fault if we're dealing with stuff Now I know it's like well that's not helpful. And yeah so it's just like I just feel like all these pressure, like, I want to like. Like I try not to lose my temper in front of him because I don't want him to be like oh Christians are like. They say this but they can't like practice what they preach. But then I have to like defend him in front of like my church friends, and you know elders because they're like you know you have to do, Christian so it's just like I just feel like you know being like pulled on both sides, and I was like God why like why."
252.0,Provider,"Oh no well, what do you believe."
13844.0,Patient,About.
252.0,Provider,"And what is your faith, not your mom's not your churches, but what do you believe."
13844.0,Patient,"Like I am a Christian, so I really like believe in God, I believe in, like the Holy Trinity and but i'm not like because I only been like I got baptized in 2018 so I haven't been accredited for that long so i'm like not against like. Like I don't think we should like, I have to marry or data Christian because, like. I wasn't a Christian like da da da da da long ago, you know so it's like I can't I feel like. I feel like I can't be like all Christians are like if i'm Eric question like is bound to work out like I don't know that because we're all human like we're all. sinners so it's not like Christians are not going to like make the same mistakes that non Christians are so i'm like not you know, so I might go open to like whether you know he's Christmas or not. um because I like it, so you know, like i'm not gonna force him to believe, but I also have like my values so i'm not going to compromise my faith for him. So."
252.0,Provider,"understandable. um and you know it's my understanding that you know your. walk with with God is your walk with God it's a personal thing. Right, you know and i'm. You know I don't. know what kind of talk to go to you know, in the Christian realm and i've always believed in God and I was baptized as Christian too, but there were aspects of it didn't make any sense to me. we're not supposed to judge your neighbors but. We judge people all the time such. As believers. Right, so there were things there were a lot of questions that I had about organized religion and the way that they said that I had to live. And I just again, this was my personal experiences that I then realized that it is personal. And if i'm doing something morally wrong then my god's going to tell me. So that's kind of where i've sat at I just kind of feel like you know we God made us and God made everybody else on this planet and he made them different for a reason. Right I for judgment or diversity, you know it's, it is an action. that's my personally."
13844.0,Patient,So.
252.0,Provider,"You know I don't believe you know that you're doing anything wrong I don't believe that god's things that you're doing anything wrong either. You know this is your journey your personal journey with you. You know I get you know the the family. there's also that whole family history, you know and the traditions in that you know of your family unit to which is powerfully strong right and so trying to stay within the realm of of all of that can be really difficult. But again, going back to that point where it's okay you turn your phone off for a little while. Right, you know. And do with all of this after."
13844.0,Patient,After.
252.0,Provider,"you're done with your test, and I know you're gonna pass it. I know you are. And I think you know it to. You just got to do the primaries."
13844.0,Patient,"yeah I feel Okay, but I think I am like. subconsciously I am stressed out, even though I don't feel like because usually like I would feel stressed out, but I just like i'm just like eating nonstop. Even though, like i'm like constantly hungry and i'm just like it's clearly like manifesting in some ways. Just like I don't physically feel stress, which is like I rather just be like, if I can physically feel and know I know i'm stressed, but I think i'm not but then like my body's telling me, I am. Because I like I. like eating is one of like my coping ways to cope with stress and I know it, but. But I just like lately just from like hungry all the time, constantly eating and i'm just like, why are you like, I know i'm not pregnant, like, I know that for sure. Like, why are you so much."
252.0,Provider,"It could be you know also you think about it, if you're not resting right. Your systems, out of whack. hmm you know what I mean he has to have that balance of sleep and nutrition and water, you know, and if one of them is out of whack, of course, it would make sense that you're compensating in this other direction."
13844.0,Patient,"Right, I make sense, you know."
252.0,Provider,"You know. You know, you can also think of it that way you know, and right now is a moment in time it's not something that you're going to do forever. you're going to get some sleep. So just remembering that to you know."

252.0,Provider,"makes sense me too, because I usually I do good in the work, and then the tests, I just bomb at because i'm so stressed about, but this is what I did my the hugest test of my life is I went in and all the way to the testing Center I prayed. I prayed and I just said it's going to be whatever it's going to be, I know that if i'm supposed to pass this test then i'm going to pass this test. I know you're here with me i'm going to give it my best effort and that, and I mean I talked to myself, it was a 45 minute drive and I talked to myself and I talked to God, all the way there. um and I went in took some deep breaths started my test I passed it. um but it took away all the anxiety of it all it took away all of the doubt it took away it's going to be whatever it's going to be. Right right it's just about connecting with your higher power and getting on that level and saying i'm going to do the best I can. Please help me."

They don't know i'm going through so like I don't need to compare myself to them. Right so. yeah so so i'm trying to you know, whatever happens happens so. Good yeah."
252.0,Provider,"that's what I had to do to you know. And that's really because you're not going to set yourself up for a huge dis of women, if you wind up not passing you say be is going to whatever is supposed to be.

So, like in the beginning, like a psych myself out a little bit, so I was like. You know freaking out for no reason um so I definitely happen taking a serious."
252.0,Provider,have to say.
13844.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so was I got a delicate balance between like. You know don't freak out too much that you can't study because they're freaking out so much. yeah and then like being overconfident it's like you know so yeah so I feel like you know I feel like i've done a lot of study to this boy.

13844.0,Patient,"And that makes a difference yeah because I hate when it's like. You didn't get it, because you know didn't know it's because you misread the question, or like you missed one word or."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, one word and make a difference of the MENA lesson."
13844.0,Patient,"So, so I think like one of the like tutors were saying like make sure you read each question twice before you answer. Like if you don't see the answer choice, like you know, and if you think if you don't see the answer like go back to the question we read make sure like. You answering the correct questions and."
252.0,Provider,The answers there.
13844.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's it's there's just like. And it's like really annoying because the algorithm rhythm is. The way we're like the type of questions to go wrong, and they keep giving you that type of question. So it's like you, if your weaknesses math and then like they're going to keep giving them a question so it's like everyone's questions. are different so it's like you know, some people are like oh I got like there's all my questions i'm here like I didn't get any questions so it's like all like you don't know what even again. So it's just have to know everything."
252.0,Provider,"Definitely wow that's kind of amazing, though."
13844.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know like and nobody knows like what the percentage, you need to score to pass the passings I go 25 out of 50. um but it's not like you only need 50% correct it's like they don't like nobody knows like someone some people were saying like high 70s, that you need to you know get like 75% correct. To get. A 25 but like no one knows the exact mountain when you're doing practice tests you're like Am I passing like I don't know you know. So. Just kind of have to like go and see that day. To do that, like everything I can you know and then leave it up to God because out of my control."
