214.0,Provider,Hello. How are you.
14499.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, why just okay today."
14499.0,Patient,I was supposed to go get my left or my right arm scars covered today.
214.0,Provider,What happened.
14499.0,Patient,Something came up for the tattoo artist and I had to reschedule for another day.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i've been tied to are you going to get, by the way."
14499.0,Patient,i'm i'm really into Greek mythology so I. want to get a portrait of.
214.0,Provider,"awesome. Okay, how many touches you have."
14499.0,Patient,it's gonna be my first one.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so I need to warn you, I have 22."
14499.0,Patient,All right.
214.0,Provider,"So it's like a bag of chips. You. Can you can. I have them all over. You can't I have I don't. I can't explain why but everybody says the same thing they're like you know one will not suffice and i'm like no stop the madness it I got them like one after another Baba Baba Baba. And then I was like okay. Take it take it easy kid so I know I it's great I also believe there's a. there's a there's like a healing process to something there's a there's like a almost like a loss and grief, but then like a rebirth that's how I see that was tattoos usually for me, I say man. There were there were there are specific times in life, whether they were severely bad or tremendously good there they were a picture of time for me right. Like we take pictures, but these are pictures for me to always remember by so they're very, very personal to me and and i'm always inspired by because I think you know what What better way to be reborn. them to say this is this is something I want to put on me this is what's important to me and I want the world to know it, so I think that's pretty cool I."
14499.0,Patient,that's why I actually chose PR stephanie because she's the goddess of spring and rebirth and I think that's very symbolic.
214.0,Provider,And I know nothing about her but look what I just said. Right almost the same premise. that's awesome to how's mood been lately.
14499.0,Patient,"um. I don't know i've been like. I don't want to say, like happy, but almost a little manic. For the past two weeks. i'm. Just really high highs and some kind of looking out for like the lows to come."
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so when you're describing mania what are you saying, because you just stay in your manic but I don't know the action or what's going on."
14499.0,Patient,"i'm even with my sleeping medications I can't sleep i'm always up i've been up for three days now i'm. always on the move, always doing something I completely cleaned and reorganize the entire apartment the other day. Last night I shampoo our carpets like just I have to do something i'm always like super busy, and things that. Normally I don't really get super excited over i've been like oh my gosh that's, the best thing ever and I didn't know like in my head that it's not actually the best thing ever, and I feel like after this episode is over i'm just gonna be like really, really down."
214.0,Provider,"or not. or not Okay, we need to show, when I look at let's just look at this so. Are you still taking the frustration."
14499.0,Patient,let's pro.
214.0,Provider,So the process was for the bad dreams.
14499.0,Patient,For something yeah yeah.
214.0,Provider,We are you taking that. But you're not sleeping. Let me take a look at some times and i'm going to share the screen we're going to review something together that's How long do you think you've been and what you're claiming to be mania.
14499.0,Patient,about nine days now.
214.0,Provider,"You should have crashed already. Maybe this is something different, and we're seeing it as mania."
14499.0,Patient,Maybe.
214.0,Provider,"i'm just looking. To roll. depressive disorder. and Post traumatic stress and there's usually no manian post traumatic stress. This is maybe a new you i'm not i'm not so sure it's mania. It just sounds like you're you're stuck on full throttle I don't know why that is. So let's look at this, because this is interesting. So let's share the screen, this is your survey. and your survey, let me make a little bigger so you can like see. So your survey for depression says you're depressed. 18. Now you didn't describe any depression to me. You actually when you actually went to was the anxiety side, like you know, like I just can't sit and you know i'm like i'm like running on the treadmill forever and i'm not getting tired. But if you look at your anxiety anxieties up there, so that this kind of makes some sense but as far as the depressive you're answering as if you have moderate to severe so what's triggering that."
14499.0,Patient,I get really low days I don't know what else really call them my roommate called the low days um.
214.0,Provider,You mean like when you don't do anything.
14499.0,Patient,yeah I can't seem to find the energy to do anything like I can't motivate myself to do anything and i'm just kind of. down and that's when like I start thinking about like salt Harley.
214.0,Provider,"I know I could I can see that here. But, but in your state today you have no time to think about that. Right you're not thinking about it it's just when you start becoming for the landing. So when's the last time that you came in for a landing nine days ago."
14499.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,How long have you been on the medication.
14499.0,Patient,"um, this is my third week on it."
214.0,Provider,i'm wondering if the medication hasn't found its balance it's 14 to 21. So it'd be interesting to see if I mean I don't want you to feel you're amazing I it sounds like you can't shut off. Many it doesn't last for nine days that would be that would be what an episode to have. um Have you ever had this length of time where you have this full throttle full of energy.
14499.0,Patient,Now.
214.0,Provider,"So this is a first for you to. And the only thing I can attribute that to is your medication because were you taking medications before. Now right, so I can only assume that the medications are providing you. offer motivation, hopefully, when you start shampoo and run you're overly motivated, but do you feel bad about being overly motivated, are you are you worried, this is just going to drop them into jobs is going to be it's going to be the worst side of how good I am now."
14499.0,Patient,"yeah that's exactly what it is i'm just waiting for, like the shoe to drop."
214.0,Provider,"i'm not sure that's coming up. I mean you need to be careful that psychologically you don't make a job. Like worrying about. The next shoe to drop could make the next shoe drop like because that's what happens if we think hard enough about something we asked me to make something true, I would just say took it you can't find anything. Without moving around to do. It has to be all about movement and being preoccupied and doing tasks."
14499.0,Patient,i'm sure that I could find something if I like sat and thought about it.
214.0,Provider,"I would like to know if you're able to sit and think about some for five minutes, because what we need to figure out is this, are you stuck on full energy or you're just not sure how to change yours."
14499.0,Patient,I know this is actually like the longest that sat down and just. Not did something.
214.0,Provider,Maybe you're fidgety when you sit in front of me. yeah yeah.
14499.0,Patient,And i'm moving around so.
214.0,Provider,"it's okay it's Okay, but yet you're smiling you're happy you're laughing I mean I don't want it let's not let's not. Say nothing's happening good something's happening, I think, will I think you're you're really worried about well like this is really good but I don't want to know what really bad it is. yeah let me see if I can get a hold of Sharon real quick and see if that's a reaction. hold on for a minute um. anyway. So let let's just go and save that we don't stay full throttle the whole time, are you going to be disappointed."
14499.0,Patient,I think I feel like I stay full throttle like it gives myself more fighting chance to stay in it.
214.0,Provider,"I agree, a body in motion stays in motion so conceptually if we can stay stuck in throttle it's not the worst thing i'm just wondering, are you know. How often is set, are you going to keep saying how long is this going to last because we're actually going to pull the plug on if we keep thinking that way I just don't know if you have the ability to foods and wants to go there to switch the flight back to something else."
14499.0,Patient,"I think i've always been programmed like that, every time something like that is starting I self sabotage because I keep saying like oh this isn't gonna last so I might as well, like and now. I. Remember."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but interesting that you're saying that self sabotage but it's almost like. You know, you might now, the issue is, can you prevent that from happening currently I don't know."
14499.0,Patient,And no idea.
214.0,Provider,"yeah we don't know either. I mean, I think he's showing signs of anxiety more than you are depression, although the pressure scores high because of the suicide ideation that's what's triggering that to come up when you say several days. It told T doesn't mean something's bad or you're bad it just means that the test when you take it knows like okay so we're going to add more points because of that question, but I they intrusive enough that they're staying or they're intrusive enough that they keep moving."
14499.0,Patient,I have to say that they're saying.
214.0,Provider,And how long do they say.
14499.0,Patient,I don't know. It really varies a lot. Based on like what's going on. I don't I don't really know if I could say.
214.0,Provider,"i'm. I select let's look at it from a different perspective, are they the same thoughts."
14499.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,Do you have a plan.
14499.0,Patient,No.
214.0,Provider,What. How do they go away.
14499.0,Patient,"Sometimes. Most of the time lately because of a new agreement, my roommate is also my best friend. Okay, and so she has the same mental health struggles that I have so I know like psycho and I talked to her about like what i'm thinking so combat some way to make me see in a different way."
214.0,Provider,awesome.
14499.0,Patient,And that's been helpful.
214.0,Provider,"But I think that that's fabulous you should you know just because there's a thought, first of all, it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with us it's a thought. And the best practices, if you have someone that can help you process the thought you should go and utilize that I think you're I think that's a great thing. You gotta remember the year you're saying something before is the same as what you're saying something now let me break it down. You said you know this is like too good to be true, as nine days, this is really great you know I I can't imagine what the other side of terrible is going to be you've conditioned yourself to be this way. Over time, this is how you built yourself so with suicide ideation it's the same thing. These thoughts over time become regular practices, because we haven't had an opportunity. To either disregard them or find somebody to help us leave them so they happen all the time, so the mere fact that you have someone is you're trying to break pattern. And you're trying to break you know conditioning, so you have to give yourself a little break with that don't be. so fearful because you have a solution pause the ideation if you didn't have a solution, we will be in a different place but we're not we're Okay, and how long have you how long Have you had ideations for."
14499.0,Patient,Since I was nine.
214.0,Provider,"Right so and how old, are you now. 22 okay so. When I say condition, you understand that 922 is 11 years of the same pattern. So just imagine what it will take to undo a pattern and create a new pattern and that's all that's all you're working on, and I do think you're doing a good job I don't think you should be fearful of the ideation. This is something that the mind the mind you know went to go to the bathroom right that's. that's conditioning. Right, you know when you're supposed to brush your teeth, you know kind of when you're going to eat you've conditioned yourself to know all these things. ideation has become part of a conditioning and all we need to do now is in this particular one is break that and go elsewhere with it. And just give yourself time now give yourself time. When did she answer. Oh yeah. Can you call just hang on i'm going to call because transcribe it for the for the purposes of recording i'm coining Sharon stats the nurse practitioner regarding Julia is your Bowling. ball yeah okay. This is perfect This way we can kind of figure out what's going on here. hey Sharon is manny how are you. I am great so listen I am on with Julia Bowling. So. In when I reflective of a child, I don't see anything that deals with like manic depressive I see the ptsd for her so i'm not putting you on the spot so we're actually on zoom and the question is she's had nine days of super activity she's calling it mania the mania is organizing. shampooing carpets she's basically not even sleeping so she's considering this to be mania and her concern for the last nine days is is is, are we looking for in a crash, so how good it's been is it going to be that terrible if there's a come down and is this mania. And there will be a crash so. I will call her back. Great. You but. you're awesome you're awesome Thank you so much for helping me out. Just tell me when you're available we'll catch up. Thank you so much. Okay bye bye. So, will you ever hear some of that Julia."
14499.0,Patient,yeah I heard it.
214.0,Provider,"So you don't have a mood stabilizer. Right so she she believes is mania right so she's gonna call you and talk to you about getting mood stabilizer this way the crash won't be like you know 747 hidden until building there'll be a dip but not an extreme deploy you're going to be like oh this depression is terrible. um are you okay with that. yeah yeah no, I think I think it's kind of great that you able to express this and I also think you know you knowing yourself best and knowing that it's labeled mania is great, and the mere fact that I was able to get in touch with Sharon. she'll probably call you back in an hour and provide you a mood stabilizer so we can be in front of the crash. So I think this is a good thing okay. Okay awesome so now. Our next appointment. just give me a second. and try to. start taking that prescription as soon as possible. Or are you, you are right. here. And right. here. So we don't have another appointment. So what's flexibility like because I just don't remember."
