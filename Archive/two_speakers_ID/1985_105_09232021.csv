So even if we only do that today, these are. skills as well, that you can use that you and I can use for other activities they're going to stay inside. Your treatment plan so be able to reference them if you forget okay Okay, so I want to talk to you about. The different parts of the brain for just a minute left part of the brain. Is where we store knowledge. We have access to words it's kind of like where all the facts are. The Left part of the brain it's it's not like the right side the right part of the brain, is where we use imagination. that's where we're going to be today. are going to be in the imagination, which is not fact it could be, but it doesn't have to be in order to allow our fantasy and imagination to work for us. So, first I want. To develop three. Three resource figures in your mind and i'm going to write them down. And they're going to be a part of your resource team so i'm going to describe the requirements for the first one. And don't edit yourself just allow your imagination to to be on your side, so allow it to present okay so there's a protective figure there's a nurturing figure and there's a wise figure The first one is protective so the instructions. Are Nice. want you to think of. A protective figure that is either real. or imagined it could be from a movie a book a TV show. When you think of the perfect protective figure what's an image that comes to mind."
1985.0,Patient,My kids. too easy but yeah that was trying to protect me that's. rubbish go beyond that.
105.0,Provider,"i'm going to ask you to there's there and i'll tell you in a minute why now let's come back and let me tell you I want you to go to do. Something imagined it could be an animal a person, a character you saw in a movie that really embodied only. Protection. They didn't let you down they didn't break your heart they didn't make you angry, maybe you saw it in a TV show and read it in a book and they really represent the sort of. Perfect embodiment environment of a protective nature."
1985.0,Patient,could be an animal.

All of the strength skills, the creativity and what is special about you this finger can see it in you. nurturing figure that's all they do, they never discourage they always this figure always believes in you, what is the first thing that comes to mind."
1985.0,Patient,My mom.
105.0,Provider,"My mom got it that one may work we'll see i'll check in with in just a second we'll go to the third one, the third one, is a wise figure this. person has knowledge, not only do they have knowledge they know how to use it they've got the street smarts. They are. wise in that they know how to take what they've learned through books or from experience and they know how and what to do, they are wise what's the first image. or character that comes to mind."

1985.0,Patient,Of course.
105.0,Provider,"So I want you to work beyond brother. and go to. A character that you really you can't easily come up with the opposite, that it was kind of made a dumb decision. might be to go to that creative world."
1985.0,Patient,My dog.
105.0,Provider,"So. Your dog is wise, is that right, yes, very. we're gonna go back to this character of nurturing. Extra movie you've seen TV show something you have read. Where a character. was such a cheerleader champion encouraging. And you would maybe want that, as a resource for you."
1985.0,Patient,"it's hard because they only watch like dramas and horror flicks. No Internet access, like different imagination and."
105.0,Provider,So in the trauma want you to picture a drama that you've watched where there's someone That was really encouraging.

Okay, and you're welcome to think of them on your own to and it's nice to have visualizations where we feel supported, and these are ones that we've identified. Now we're going to. You don't have to write them down, but you can, if adults we've got Panda bear as a protective figure. nurturing figure is abby from CSI. And a wise figure is pop and boots boots. flies. Okay, great so we're going to go to the next visual. visual is called an emotional."
1985.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Sometimes Melanie people will say things like oh I didn't think about I didn't think about it, I put it out in my mind. Sometimes people will say that well in here what we're going to do is we're going to do it very intentionally create a container. Where we're going to put all of your emotional stuff all the negative. So it's like compartmentalizing and we're going to do it intentionally. So the instructions are these. I want you to think of a container using your imagination, that is big enough strong enough. To hold all that negative stuff and what would it be."
1985.0,Patient,In double triple vault well.

Ships airplanes a balloon. there's lots of different ways that things move away from us, it might be on a leaf running down the river, it could be anything that is moving away from you. To the point that it moves so far away, they can't see it anymore, and we need needs to be one that you, you like what would be a distancing that he could use kind of like."

1985.0,Patient,Like I guess like what like the icon the tide I guess it's more. Like the time yeah goes goes away. It goes.
105.0,Provider,"that's fine moving tide moving out. So maybe it'll come in it'll pick up the thing, maybe it's a negative memory. Take it out. take away take it out in a way, got it perfect like it. That element of water in there and is this, this is an ocean right. Yes, okay. Beautiful. So we've done that take a few more minutes and i'm going to i'm going to take a look at your. relapse prevention plan and we're going to put in a couple of items each one of these categories. And then. We can let you go today, but you don't have to stay here time I want you to think about if he can an emotional trigger. that's happened to you when emotion. be sad. angry afraid disgusted surprise shame see angry an emotion that is a trigger or has been a trigger for you to use drugs or alcohol."

Either you immediately went and did drugs or alcohol or you had a craving and then ultimately you ended up using what was a relationship trainer I was something that maybe happened in a relationship with.
