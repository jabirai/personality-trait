418.0,Provider,What what is something that you see you need help with.
13731.0,Patient,"Well, I my whole life like to work and leave the House I clean and clean and clean, I would like to get a job and get out of this House I think that's number one reason that's driving me crazy. Like I am so worried about taking care of everybody else does needs that. I don't tend to my own ever and it's sad, I mean I used to wear my hair don't do my makeup now I don't even feel like I got time to do that either. Because it's I gotta worry about this one worry about that, when give this one, a ride make sure the grandbabies you know, in his days and nicer screwed up. band, and it is overwhelming with that I literally sleep no sleep at all, because when I say he stays up to 5am and there's nothing you can. Do one week he. won't be like that, because it's autism hey who just stay up for days and days and days and and i'm the only one that's willing to put up with it, so I stay up for days and days missing. You know I can't go to one second think about falling asleep on it baby yet so it makes me kind of irritable because I had no sleep over and. Then I gotta cook and clean and I got to adult daughters within an hour that though nothing when I say nothing I mean nothing they don't clean up after themselves, they don't wash a dish."
418.0,Provider,They don't buy laundry so so what's the possibility of you becoming independent and just living on your own.
13731.0,Patient,"The possibility is that if I do, that I don't get to see the baby that's already been said, a million times. And that I get I stayed in the basement pretty much out of her way, so the babies little bit more importantly than to worry about what she I just don't fool with her most of the time, but. I am going to start working down at the pasture to pasture in my neighborhood she bought a store and it's a grocery store right two doors down from your mo work there, why the babies at school, starting on the 10th. So that's you know i'm close to pasture mean we're pretty nice she likes me, you know she pretty Nice. she's a young black woman it's 44 came to our neighborhood and we live like a ghetto community and she cleaned a place up came from Detroit and just it's amazing what she has done is young, she is so it's possible but maybe she is wonderful she's wonderful."
418.0,Provider,"What area, do you live in."
13731.0,Patient,"I live in Monroe. Right right right by Toledo between Toledo in Detroit right in between them both. huh yeah between Ohio and Michigan right on the border there between Detroit and you know just a small town, but a lot of Detroit people come to our area, because you know I I don't know why, but it started back in the 90s and there's like majority of the hometown Detroit people now."
418.0,Provider,Okay.
13731.0,Patient,But it's real.
418.0,Provider,But it's really Ohio.
13731.0,Patient,nope nope it's before you get to file right it's in Michigan but there's like two little colonies it's my calling into little comments in here in Toledo Ohio it's not far. gotcha it's easier to get to it's. less time to get to the end is that each wipers that say hey can I were to get to the point where it takes 20 minutes to get to a oh.
418.0,Provider,gotcha okay so So if you were to go independent you would be you would suffer that you wouldn't be able to see your grandchild.
13731.0,Patient,"yeah and it's that's what you said, but I anyway don't worry that either because. He can't make it without me and I can't make it without him. She knows that she can't handle you can't."
418.0,Provider,"She can't he, like."
13731.0,Patient,"hitter and stuff he doesn't do that to me I don't know why, but like he'll hitter or he won't do that to me I don't you don't do that to me at all, so I don't she'll bring him back down here to me like he sent me going crazy I can't deal with this, you know she can't. She can't she's not designed for a kid at all, let alone on autistic that's for sure I think she just wanted had the baby to keep his Daddy well that didn't work so."
418.0,Provider,"So why, so why don't you so why don't you do you think it would be wise for you to try and get independent housing to kind of give yourself get. To kind of find yourself. In a whole mess. You know, and then. What would that look like, for you."
13731.0,Patient,"I would love it, but I guess I guess the whole thing is that we live in the House that I grew up in my mom raised me and my last my brothers and sisters and. And when I got out of jail after doing a year, I came here, instead of going home to my husband. And I redid the basement and it's just like beautiful down here she knows, she knows that I liked the basement. The rent only $700 a month here in my neighborhood you ain't gonna find those three bedroom House with a full basement attic for that cheap. She knows these things like it's it's $1,000 a month for a one bedroom in my neighborhood and that's if they're going to accept a felon which I am. I don't have bad credit i'll have any credit i've never had a credit card my life I just don't have any credit them things make her heart she knows that it is it's it's rough."
418.0,Provider,So so it'd be rough to yeah I get that it would be. rough and. i'm just i'm just looking to see. What kind of boundaries you'd be able to.
13731.0,Patient,"To create when I tried to do is tell her, she got credit she's got money in the bank she don't spend no money she got money she tightwad she could move out and go get her, she Oh, I want a nice because we live in a We live in a lower side of town. I want a brand new House like a trailer with brand new walls, you know I grew up in this House and i'm 46. And this House was here before I ever was invented so I mean it's it's not bad it's got a lot of potential, but it's not. Like the screen doors missing the screen out of it that's all because of her friends coming over here party and like stuff like that well. One go on, if this was just my house it wouldn't be harder I keep this House up with all these people, the best i've seen dumps it, I think. This is horrible to me, but other people like, how do you keep your also claimed to me I don't think that it is, I mean, but to other people I guess it could be a. lot worse, I mean but i've never been one to be dirty I don't like it, but it becomes overwhelming when I go in the bathroom there's fit in the secret. From someone's brushing their teeth, why is that still sitting there. And I shouldn't have to clean that out of there you're growing you guys are growing I shouldn't have to wipe out to seek it just like little petty stuff like. Like my son uses the bottle brush cleaning shoes with Why would you even tip to touch that Barbara it doesn't make sense and they're 20 years old and 25 I got a 20 year old twins it with her and 25 year old daughter, and I have a son this 21 that's off to college. at the University of Alabama Melanie just sounds."
418.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13731.0,Patient,"Oh he's the guy he was over yesterday, and he became a dad at 14 and but he never quit school he stayed on his track I got a six year old brand or that is been in my life, since the day she was born and I have a good song or good one he stays away from us and I don't blame me."
418.0,Provider,Where is he where is he.
13731.0,Patient,I Alabama.
418.0,Provider,So okay so that's so so what you're saying is that's not really an option for you to. kind of get on your own or.
13731.0,Patient,"I would love to I would have a vote for her to go. That would be, it would make it a lot easier because all my stuff sorry here i've already did all the decorating and the painting, and all that nobody else did I did it all by myself when I got out of jail year and a half ago this place was a mess. And I did it all by myself. My own family knows it on the one that keeps laundry focus put away and where it goes I don't live out a basket sacks not made it i've never done that, but when you. get older it's not is easier to do it was easier for me to do, taking care of for little kids when they were little than it is now that they're growing up. And I think it's more or less because I feel like I shouldn't have to. Because you guys are grown up when I was their age, I wasn't expecting my mom to do that my my one my mom would never. Never my doors well I don't know no one ever taught us how to cook they throw up a lot in my face i'm like to prison my my head adopt them daggett that guilt trip lot you know you want never know mom to us, I, I guess, I feel like I owe a woman, I guess. And I think they use that against me."
418.0,Provider,"So. When does that, when does that and."
13731.0,Patient,"that's what i'd like to know when does it end because I want, and then, if I say stuff to where it's like. A bad as I hate to say it, I. I dread seeing her like she's upstairs i'm in the basement and she sleeps all day she's still on the bed matter of fact. And then, when she comes downstairs show say something, and if I say anything she'll say that's fine if i'm in a bad mood because you like, she just I don't care what I say it's not the right thing mother. mm hmm and I just I just didn't we don't get along, but at the same time, when she was a kid I should obsessed with me, at the same time, like I don't know. whether she hates me or she loves me I don't know, like everyone like she seemed like my sisters, while we say, I have three other kids besides her. don't get nowhere near the attention, or the stuff that should get not even close, not even a smidgen my youngest daughter she's a good girl she just she goes to work comes home goes to sleep early gets up early plays with her cat."
418.0,Provider,"She don't we go, so let me ask you this, to the other children ever get tired of. her and her behavior."
13731.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Yes, they do, they tell me i'm a slave that's what my son says you're her slave yeah."
418.0,Provider,and none of the other kids can she won't listen to none of the other kids either.
13731.0,Patient,"Now show you say, well, she is sold off me like she just brings the past up every time she does that look what I have to put up with look what she's done to me and that's where she'll say."
418.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13731.0,Patient,"she's the boss of everybody, and everything."
418.0,Provider,everything's.
13731.0,Patient,"got to be about her no way, no other way, like the things that she's done in her life, I haven't done on drugs, here I mean. you're sober and you're talking in treating people that way I didn't do that in my addiction. I have like a heart, I don't I don't know I have, I feel remorse about things in a conscience or she she doesn't think. Like I don't know I can't explain in human life or i've honestly can't i've now and i've seen some people in my days and they just makes me look like this is what I. This is what I created I sometimes think everything i've ever done wrong that I used to beg to have a kid I couldn't get pregnant had five miscarriages before I had her. And I you know I sometimes saying well god's gonna give me a test like ronnie kid just bad let's see how good you do with it, this is the outcome, sometimes think that I shouldn't feel that way about moment child."
418.0,Provider,Right.
13731.0,Patient,"me and then, no matter she never mean to I was there you go run she wants you to run out there, see what she wants, you know I do. as bad as I want to tell her what I really think I don't."
418.0,Provider,What do you think the repercussion would be if you were to stop catering to her.
13731.0,Patient,"that's what my husband says, every day, stop doing it, I don't know I. Look, well, the other day she said, I said Raven are you hungry and she said, I am I said I want to talk to you that's when we get into it the other night she didn't say anything. She knew I was mad you know so she she didn't I didn't talk to her for two or three days, and when I asked her sister she was hungry. She said I am I told her I won't talk to you because I make her plate still so, to this day she'll text me at 3am i'm starving and want me to go fix for Sunday. yeah."
418.0,Provider,How does it make you feel when you cater to her like that.
13731.0,Patient,"I used to I used to feel like now, at least I got her in my life i'm gonna make up for what I didn't do for when she was little, but now I feel like i've taken advantage of me she's killing me like."
418.0,Provider,"Oh, can you tell me about tell me a little bit about your timeline so you, you had your children how many did you have."
13731.0,Patient,"I had, for I had my daughter than two years later, so on, and then I had 27 months after I had him, so I have three kids the same age right now they're all the same age three months apart."

I start they made my kids go live with my mom like that year, because the domestic violence reasons um. He wanted me to stop he's ranting restraining orders he he told the judge I married her to death do us part just took that as a threat and said these kids don't need to be living in a household like this. That my daughter is about 10 and a question in her and she's like my mom used to learn how to fight better, you know that was the wrong answer for a kid to say they wasn't looking for that to be said so."
418.0,Provider,My mom knew.
13731.0,Patient,"How to fight better. me and like. When it's interesting just needs to learn how to fight better. She probably shouldn't you know they're thinking you're dead to me hit your mom at all, you know I mean, but she didn't look at it like that to them, they thought Okay, we got to get these kids out of here, because now, this kid thinks this is normal, you know."

Like I make more than an hour than you do dumb stuff smart ass and he was saying to the judge like he told the judge of the detective wanted to screw my wife.
