120.0,Provider,Eating disorder outpatient session for Yusuf shaquille. Hello morning thanks for your patience.
12819.0,Patient,"No, no proper yeah. yeah."
120.0,Provider,yeah now they find that we just barely switched over to a different. platform. Entering the group number or the room numbers and everything so there's. playing with that so.
12819.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,How are you.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm pretty good at doing well, how are you."
120.0,Provider,i'm doing just moving along as usual.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah it's just getting chill your and i've had a cold or not a cold, but like coffee for like. weeks now attentional going away. But yeah."
120.0,Provider,not good.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah um but other than that I think i've been Okay, more or less yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so um How are things going with your I know you were setting some goals around. Limiting the time on dating Apps."
12819.0,Patient,"I still did use them on the weekend, but I haven't used them, since, for example, Monday, but I did use them on Saturday and Sunday and last weekend and I met a number of people and. I mean I don't regret any of my counters. except the last one, which was on Sunday and normally I would never say no to someone, so I thought they were someone, but when I met them, I was like oh there's someone else I mean they're the same person, but they are just so. Different and i'm not really into that. So this Sunday, I actually said no to that guy I said. No we're not gonna do anything. And that we still ended up just you know talking rituals, I mean I that's okay with me. Because they were supposed to be just a day, but he at the last minute was like. He had other expectations, and I said I don't think I can do any of that good and so yeah I was happy about that part. and I like since I think i've been meeting at least like to like on Saturday Sunday night at an average they just two people will be. But I don't know why I still do it because I said I would not and. yeah it's yeah."
120.0,Provider,"I mean my my question for you, I guess is you know I guess you have to decide kind of what do you want, in your life, you know because. Like you can continue doing what you're doing if that. You know, is aligned with your values if that's what you want to be doing. But I have gotten a sense from you that you were not happy about that and that you were. kind of looking for relationships that are a little more meaningful. um but I don't know that's that's such a deep question for you to kind of figure out what is it that your that your heart desires like what do you. use in the future, what do you what are you hoping for."
12819.0,Patient,"Like on Saturday I met another first guy and he was different. I mean the good thing is i'm like no one blocked normally people I never liked to block anyone, even if it was a terrible encounter I just feel like it. hurts them, but no one that that to me either on the other hand, they'll have my numbers and we were I something we're texting or the time not even every like like there is some bridge between those still. Not that that British meaningful arm, but just knowing that, especially the guy on Saturday well, firstly, he shared the name but me his name is also use officials interesting. And we had a pretty nice conversation earlier, I think I shouldn't talk about that, more recently, there has been another. Like sad thing not sad but interesting, so you know how I go to that boxing class I at least four days a week, so there is a guy there and I know he sprayed. i'm not sure if he's I don't know if well, he was very shy and always i've known him for like three months now, but in the last one month we've become very close so every day after the class and. I Vito can be used to talk for like five minutes, and then, then it became standard like 14 minutes or an hour like there was one day the class ended at five and we were together until tend to be like almost five hours. And I will just say he's a very good friend, but, but the thing is that the only reason I started talking to him was that I just found I was attracted to him, which is so wrong. But I The more I know him the lesser cracked it to it to him i'm like in that way, I still love him as a friend i'm. Like, for example, I realized, he told me that he's abstinent teens he's 23 him he's never dated or had sex and I totally respect that yeah and here Nike has all these values, and I wish I was I had those values, I mean it's different so. I mean, I know so much about him, and I mean I i'm not physically attracted to him anymore, although I was but it's a I mean yeah so he's been. On my mind i've also lot but I because I went through this in high school in college, that I was attracted to a straight guy and you know how it is unrequited love. Like because that person will never ever show any feelings to you because they simply con their screen and there was this one guy in my in my senior year. I had a crush on him for four years, I mean for the last three years and we actually became roommates. Like it was random allocation and we both happened to become room and I was so happy to have roommates with her, I don't know what I was thinking it was probably. I should have maybe told the dorm the property manager that hey I actually want some other but I kept this optimism that something would happen, although he was toxic Lee straight, as he was homophobic to probably. But we got so close as friends over the next few months and. And then things got so sour we fought like crazy to the point that I had to leave that apartment and move to another one very toxic and it took me months like three four months to get over him, he would always be on my mind and. That is what I would call it was like my first relationship in the sense that it was like one sided, because we were technically living together. doing everything together air like cook together go to the library together work hard together go green together go shopping together, he was so dependent on me. And I was also we became codependent and I told all my friends, they all knew that I had feelings for him, and they were like you were being so stupid because he has he's probably playing with you, he wants the attention and. he's probably enjoying all of that, but he knows that the you'll do anything for him, but you know not getting get anything back. I don't know that was a complicated case I was only friend and now I I saw that happening again because. But this guy Kevin he's actually really nice everybody even compare it to that guy. But I don't want to go in that direction for there and I want to suppress all those things because it's something that simply can't happen."
120.0,Provider,yeah it's not fair to him.
12819.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,Let yourself let your own mind to kind of run wild with it and stuff.
12819.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah. I do wish I could tell him because I have to lie to him about being scraped.
120.0,Provider,So he doesn't know that you're gay. No okay.
12819.0,Patient,"I think that would make him very uncomfortable. But I do feel like we're very close like I don't often spend five hours with anyone, but with him, I can talk and talk and he can talk and talk so yeah."
120.0,Provider,"yeah I can see yeah that would be really complicated. A complicated thing to be want to be friends with somebody but. But you know but you're also having to kind of hide an important part of you. You know. out of fear of losing that friendship yeah. i'm curious, though, how you even got into the conversation with him about you know him saving himself, you know as far as for marriage or whatever. How did you even get into that conversation."
12819.0,Patient,"We just like me, then I like if we talk for two hours our topics keep evolving and. I think I was talking about my sister in general, like how she has suffered and different universities and her current relationship and and then I told him about pakistan's arranged marriages. And then he was like that would actually suits me very well because yeah I was like okay that's interesting yeah like he's also very religious. And yeah so."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
12819.0,Patient,"He also wants me to be religious but I said Oh, I gave him so many hands, but he doesn't understand that i'm gay. Maybe I tell him. cry. I told other people in my boxing class and when I told them there were some of them were like oh you didn't have to tell us we already knew, but with him he's now peace may be blind to you know, some people don't really care. attention to."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's interesting, I can see that that's kind of a confusing thing because you know I do want you to have friends, I want you to have people that you can talk to you and hang out with and sexual involvement."
12819.0,Patient,"yeah I think i've been saying i'm definitely over under there are like there's a group of girls and that boxing class and they were like. I don't know they found out that I was into him and they gave me this false hope that things are going to rise set you're being nice I don't want you to be nice I want you to be honest and. Practical there's no way it's going to work on, you should be telling me to stop doing what i'm doing. And yeah that though they said nothing yeah."
120.0,Provider,How did they know that you like.
12819.0,Patient,That I told them.
120.0,Provider,I can tell.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we were having dinner, and I just told them."
120.0,Provider,So okay.
12819.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean I one of the things. i'm always curious about is is again going back to. What do you want for yourself in the future, like how, when you see the life that you would like to be living or the person that you would like to become. And i'm not like physically like I want to look a certain way, but then like. You know how do you want like your day to day life to look like and like you do feel like your choices are going in that direction or are your choices getting you off track of the person that you want to be and I don't know if you if you know."
12819.0,Patient,You know yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Like, what do you, what do you think about that."
12819.0,Patient,"I mean, I do want stability that's one thing and that could mean that would be a lot of things, it would mean financial stability and. Not having a lot of free time on my hands and being in working and doing something that I like and also having a partner that."
120.0,Provider,"I mean, do you believe in monogamy my do you feel like you want to have somebody that. That you're ready to. each other."
12819.0,Patient,"If they are to me, I would always give back yeah yeah if we're both into it yeah."
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm and like do you see yourself getting married. yeah to have somebody at some point. yeah okay. yeah according to kind of picture. Like you know, imagining that you're married you know to a guy and that you have a House together and that you both going to work and then you come home and have dinner together or. Whatever you kind of picture as being a day to day kind of experience and like i've told you before my concerns with you going on these dating Apps is I think most people on those Apps are not looking for a long term relationship."
12819.0,Patient,"Yes, so yeah."
120.0,Provider,Why does I worry that you're that if you spend more time on that. you're going to end up like just finding more people that are not that committed to the relationship and are just kind of. Money for little hookups that sorry.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah like the guy I met on Sunday, we had planned our day a week ago, and I just knew it would be a date I wasn't expecting any sex at all, and I was like happy that there wouldn't be any. And, but like one hour before the meeting he suddenly sends me his nude pictures and I said what does that mean. And then he was like. I said I didn't think I would be doing anything like I actually should have blocked him at that point, but I didn't I still met him, but we didn't do anything sexual and it was kind of nasty."
120.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah well and that's and again that's a weird you know, like I I worry that, like you, are you know you see a date as being we're just going to hang out but I imagine a lot of people on those Apps and specifically don't have that intention. yeah those Apps, especially with like you know there's a lot of deception that happens. mm hmm. On those Apps and a lot of secrecy and people get hurt and. yeah you know I would I would you deserve to have a better relationship if that's what you want, you know deserve to have something that's not so stressful in regards to not knowing their expectations."
12819.0,Patient,"I mean. To last week, like not this weekend, but last week and I met some Indian guy and we had very similar culture and all it was interesting. And yeah I mean we did some stuff but after that, we also went on campus to this pumpkin festival and. Okay, I mean, I still be still text, but I don't see anything happening between us like there wasn't that much retraction."
120.0,Provider,"But one of the question is, though, too, is you know there's if you're looking for a relationship that you're hoping will be longer term. You know I mean, of course. Sexual attraction, obviously, is a big part of things. yeah but it's also like do I, like the person with who they are, do I, like how they live their life do I respect. People. You know and it's not just. about to be attractive. To them all the time because people's bodies constantly change."
12819.0,Patient,"Except for example with him just him like very specific example, firstly, he was insecure very insecure about himself, and so are a lot of people even me but. I think he was more insecure than I was and and, like him, being a person he has food choices were the opposite of mine, he didn't like anything that I like he he basically had very, very limited diet and I said how can I live my life but someone who eats 5% I host choices are 5% of mine. Like there's nothing in common so maybe before we had stuff and but like right, then I realized that we are incompatible and. i'm not even going to put any effort into this. Right, although we didn't have God, but I intend to attend. yeah and then there are other people, I mean they are not that I wouldn't say smart, but they just don't care about their future. I mean they're not that career, or they are but they're like you know they just want to do the bare minimum, and I think there are so many factors involved and. That one thing can even Kevin he's my friend Kevin is a boxing guy. I at first, I found him very attractive like when he was a mystery guy to me who would be so reserved and not talk to anyone and but the more I knew him, for example, I found out that he is so insecure about himself to the point that he's having face surgery. done next month, like plastic surgery, and I said that to me when I thought that you're only 23 and I think you have a great face, but he was pointing out to this chain of his journals and I said wow. yeah sad and he said he already has had some chest surgery done because we didn't lie how his bones were and I thought that this is what I thought he was this is healthy, he thinks he is and. he's not happy and his own body and yeah. i'm going to wouldn't think of doing any plastic surgery, but there are people who wanted done I didn't know yeah so."
120.0,Provider,"I, we have to do strange culture that way, how it seems like everything is photoshopped everything is you know made to look perfect and so people then see themselves as not enough comparing themselves to something that's not real."
12819.0,Patient,mm hmm. You know yeah.
120.0,Provider,"it's another very, very few people in the world that have the ideal, you know shape fault for all of that, you know as far as what people think it might be that you know, most people have some traits that are nice and some traits."
12819.0,Patient,that are less there you know.
120.0,Provider,I don't know I just makes me sad that somebody you know is that desperate to where they're going to use that much money. To go through something like that that just. that's kind of just not really that. You know.
12819.0,Patient,"you're um. Well, so he has that in a month from now so. He looks like a different person. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully it'll help them to be more okay with themselves."
12819.0,Patient,yeah. um.
120.0,Provider,yeah that's that's tricky. i'm glad that you have some friends at your boxing class some some girls and him.
12819.0,Patient,You know that are.
120.0,Provider,That are that you've found some people to talk to and.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah I think it's likely to stay that we have dinner together so that's pretty. Good too. yeah and. Oh yeah and since I started coughing instead of taking care of my diet, I just started eating ice cream, like every day. And I think that, like prolong that prevented me from healing so that's something that i've noticed that every time i'm sick or have an injury I tend not to take care of myself, especially in terms of my diet, the."
120.0,Provider,Inside you think that is.
12819.0,Patient,"I don't know I just feel like bad that oh i'm not feeling great and if I find comfort in food, perhaps. Although I know that in that moment ice cream feels good, but after I eat it I cough for a while, so. yeah interesting gear."
120.0,Provider,yeah that's an interesting observation about how when you're feeling bad physically it tends to make you crave comfort food. yeah. You know. mm hmm whereas some people go off food when they're having a hard time you know where they. lose their appetite but other people. You know crave the comfort food piece.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah. So I mean I try, I had to have there hasn't been a day I didn't eat it, although in small quantities, but. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"When it's in it's okay to eat ice cream there's nothing wrong. The overall picture is to try to do things in moderation, know and to you know be kind of aware of what you're eating, so that it helps your body to be comfortable with what your body needs and. it's hard to. You know kind of figure out that balance and a lot of times. Especially with all the. feedback we get from society about food being good or bad."
12819.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, I have been eating quite a lot, not a lot as an unhealthy amount. So, like how I had told that I could never eat like 3000 calories a day, but now I do, because I think that's what's required."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12819.0,Patient,yeah I don't feel shame about it so.
120.0,Provider,"Good that's, the most important part is to not feel the shame or not let the shame kind of overwhelm you. yeah yeah. And how are things with your family."
12819.0,Patient,"yeah they're good to my sister has cove it again for this you got it the second time, and this time it was quite rough. To achieve recovering and yeah my parents are fine too. yeah I think they're doing well."
120.0,Provider,Are you seeing them in are you going on to London.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going and then like a month and a half, oh yeah. middle of December I won't be seeing my dad though because he's in Pakistan, but I will be seeing my mom and my sister and my grandmother, and everyone else."
120.0,Provider,Does he live in Pakistan full time and then your mom lives in London full time.
12819.0,Patient,"No, no, no, they both live in Pakistan, but my mom goes to London like at least once a year, because. my grandmother lives there."
120.0,Provider,Her family's there okay.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah my grandmother used to come to Pakistan some like but not anymore, because she's too old. And she doesn't like to travel um so yeah she does go there and yeah this is recent she's going to be there i'll be there, too, but my dad hasn't been there and a very long why."
120.0,Provider,Is there a particular reason for that.
12819.0,Patient,I think he just doesn't like to meet my grandmother like I don't know all the data and whenever they talk they're very respectful but he would never live in her house. Like even for we and my grandmother would insist that he live there and not anywhere else. And he does go on official life for his office but. night that was two three years ago and yeah.
120.0,Provider,So he did kind of avoid it.
12819.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,And why do you why do you think he would be so insistent on not staying with them. That staying with her.
12819.0,Patient,"And I didn't know he has to endorse right because he has to it, so the other end laws he's very close to, but that other end lows there. She liked his other mother in law is also his on as in his his maternal on so he married his first cousin so he's very close to them, but but with my. i've and I think it's got to do with my my aunt as in my mother sister she she always has these very cold very cold attitude towards my dad. I don't know why because she never wanted my mom to marry him because he already had a wife and because of him, she went to Pakistan, and she left the UK."
120.0,Provider,So i'm just i'm giving it your dad practices plural marriage.
12819.0,Patient,as to why he's here.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, I don't know how I missed that."
12819.0,Patient,I know yeah he has to live so.
120.0,Provider,That pretty typical.
12819.0,Patient,"There, no, no, not really no, we are dot one yeah."
120.0,Provider,I don't know if that's part of the culture or. Religion or.
12819.0,Patient,"it's not common at all, we are everywhere yeah I don't know if anyone else in my phone my high school friends who had it know. Somebody you're the only one, but in my family it's common like one of my uncle's passage to. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"it's interesting how cultures or how different people do different things and. yeah so see, they can be legally married to two people at the same time."
12819.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I mean, he can have up to four wives, according to the law but."
120.0,Provider,Can females have more than one husband.
12819.0,Patient,"I know only men can have more than one wife. I didn't know that. yeah. yeah so yeah so I have never seen my dad in the UK, actually, although he lived there for many years before I was born um yeah but my grandmother has come to Pakistan, many times and then she comes to our House there and."
120.0,Provider,"She says she's getting older, analysis, she doesn't want."
12819.0,Patient,yeah she doesn't travel anymore. yeah yeah yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Do you are you. bummed about not getting to see your dad or is that is that kind of Okay, for you."
12819.0,Patient,um so that's interesting because At first I bought the tickets to Pakistan. Like I was going to go there and then my mother told me to cancel them and I also lost some money because I didn't get a full refund. So my dad doesn't know that my dad know so when my dad found out that I was incoming apparent apparently my mother said that oh i'm heartbroken your dad cried because he won't be seeing you um but I wasn't as disappointed about not being able to see him. Not as disappointed as he is like I mean I didn't cry or anything well I wasn't even there dice I was kind of happy.
120.0,Provider,That type so yeah cuz I thought you were I remember you had said that that you know that that relationship is kind of tense and that you always feel like you're not enough for him.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's like that, I mean. Like he whenever he call I don't like yesterday I call him my either a call my mother, my mother passes the phone to him it's not like I would call him. So. it's through that that I have to talk to him for like one or two minutes or something like that, but. Sometimes, he really asks me like oh so, what are you doing what is your research about tell me and I don't want to tell him I don't like to tell him or so yeah he asked me specific questions and I don't really like that either. Because he knows all of that, because he's the same. disciplines so. Oh okay."
120.0,Provider,"So you don't like. dance answering questions about your research, because you feel like he already knows, or you feel like he's just making small talk or."
12819.0,Patient,"Oh it's because I feel like he he would try to influence my choices and. Okay um I feel like he has had enough he has made a lot of decisions for me when I didn't want him to and they're not anymore so that's why I wouldn't even tell him what i'm doing so, he cannot give me any advice."
120.0,Provider,That makes sense.
12819.0,Patient,"To me yeah. that's his advice is very old school because. He was in the industry does he work only in Pakistan so everything he has he knows it's very Pakistan oriented. He doesn't know about what goes on in the rest of the world, and he doesn't care and he still expects me to work in Pakistan after graduating which I would don't want to know so whatever he tells me it's going to help me with the life in Pakistan, so I wouldn't really listen so interesting."
120.0,Provider,So he has the expectation that you're going to come back there.
12819.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Then you're like no why, why do they mean, why did you come. To the US for school is it just better schooling."
12819.0,Patient,"yeah it's much it's for now and and it's much better so yeah. it's pretty common like to study hair and then work in Pakistan, but yeah."
120.0,Provider,That has got to be a tough. role for you to be in right now with you know. know that the thing cuz you have a lot of kind of. secrets in your life or other agendas that your dad doesn't know about.
12819.0,Patient,You know yeah.
120.0,Provider,"No, and you got to kind of play this game with him until you."
12819.0,Patient,know the veil Mike my strategy is to avoid talking to him. yeah.
120.0,Provider,"I can see why you do that. yeah yeah It makes sense. For sure um. Do you think I remember, at one point, you had told me, I think that i'm like your dad had ideas for an arranged marriage for you."
12819.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,"Is that is that. It as I was. I don't know the culture is that something that your parents decide together or is. There you have to do if they do that, or is it just."
12819.0,Patient,"I don't know they have. To, but I do have to honor their like if they recommend someone to me, and I am expected to meet that person and at least meet and tell them visit a yes or no, hopefully it's a yes. So that's why worrisome but i'm not thinking about it. yeah it happens, the most probably one of my dad's friends their daughter yeah or my mother and my dad are probably actively not actively looking, but they will, in a few years and. Then we'll try to. Invite some people to our House and give me surprises, oh no can we have someone's someone here for you do you want to meet her."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12819.0,Patient,"So they were arranging this and their hope is that one of them, I would like. And then I would tell my parents that I like her, then they would tell the girls parents that our son likes or and then David."
120.0,Provider,"Today do it that's interesting so like if. In in that culture you it goes through the parents, it sounds like. yeah. You wouldn't tell the girl herself."
12819.0,Patient,"And then the girls, but boys parents would then asked their daughter that Oh, do you also like a man, and they would tell my parents that Oh, she also likes him so parents are involved in the entire thing."
120.0,Provider,"interesting. Cultural stuff is up very interesting how. See places, do you think so differently."
12819.0,Patient,So the parents are the dating that for us. yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So, if your parents had somebody in mind that you know that that they liked and they're hoping that you would like, but you are just not into it. yeah would that be hurtful to them or offensive or is it."
12819.0,Patient,"too early it's Okay, but there comes a point I guess like when they've. shown you like 50 different matches and you keep on saying no and, eventually, you should agree on someone. But they can give you a lot of choices keeps giving you choices yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Is it, is it acceptable to just be single or is that not considered a good thing."
12819.0,Patient,"not really no, you should be married by 30 so yeah. yeah. yeah it is they do yeah it's a requirement type of the."
120.0,Provider,requirement for.
12819.0,Patient,"yeah the big event it's also a religious thing I do know someone in my family there two women they're like one of my mother's uncle's there don't like my mother's cousin. And, most of them are unmarried and they're in their late 50s and the whole family's says weird stuff about them that oh they're going to go crazy they haven't been married on their lives but. But their sole reason it's not like their career women that they were and that's the reason that they actually stay at home and take care of their dad. So the reason they're single is that their dad is a very strict guy So whoever used to propose their daughter, he was to say no to everyone. So he wouldn't let their daughter got married there, though his daughters getting married and they are still single but that's on here. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"So it's so interesting yeah. i'm like if at some point, like when when your family finds out about you know be you being gay. Like, what do you think that they'll like. disown you are like what like what, what are the what is How does that look in that culture or that are in that religion."
12819.0,Patient,"Though I don't know if anyone who is in my family, so I can't I would be the first one so. I can't. really say. Like we have no examples of fair and. I think this I think they would disown it's a very strong thing, but they would be very angry and try to say how do you know how is it, are you sure. This and that. yeah I have no clue."
120.0,Provider,"What is the religious. repercussions like, as do you get kicked out of the religion or something like."
12819.0,Patient,"That well, according to the scriptures. We are going to hell for sure if you're gay you're going to hell and yeah it's the worst day. Apparently, every time a man has sex with another sex god's throne shakes. So that's what it is, so in that well how I think that it's happening all the time, if someone is doing get somewhere out of 7 billion people so i'm not sure if that's a literal. thing like be taken literally so they really and then there was the store like there are maybe it's also in the Bible is it Solomon or law. I don't know what if the prophets like the entire city was like destroyed because they were doing too much gay sex so yeah there's so much stigma around it, that. The nfl the Muslims know that gay people are bad, so they would think their own songs out of them, and they would be like, oh no."
120.0,Provider,"Okay Oh, that is, that is tricky that's a tough place for you to be in. Do you do, and you might not even know this i'm just kind of curious. I wonder if people in that culture end up you know. Like me, you know, maybe marrying a female and just kind of playing that role. really just to try to kind of."
12819.0,Patient,"it's even more than hair like. On that on grindr I see so many married men who are like discrete. married guy looking for casual far and i'm like that's what their profiles so common if it happens here it definitely happens in Pakistan. The people get stuck in these marriages, because they're afraid of their parents and families and they just marry, a woman and. They really live like a fake lives yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,I can imagine how hard that would be to maintain.
12819.0,Patient,yeah yeah I don't think I would fall into that trap to know.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah so before you, you know you wouldn't. You wouldn't you know choose to marry somebody like that your parents had arranged for you, you wouldn't do that over being honest with them about your sexuality, you would tell them. yeah i'm gay."
12819.0,Patient,"I mean the way I see it, is that I wouldn't tell them that i'm gay and at the same time I would prevent there, I mean I would prevent them from getting married. I would live a single a while having the secret husband, I mean."
120.0,Provider,Right that's kind of what you would have to do.
12819.0,Patient,seems dangerous.
120.0,Provider,yeah that's so tricky wow.

120.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah.
12819.0,Patient,"i've considered telling some of my other cousins but it's very dangerous because. They can tell their parents and they can tell my grandmother can't really trust them. There was one point I was going to tell one of my cousins but I will was very confused, that is, she religious or she's not because she was giving me she was like sometimes she would seem religious sometimes she would seem like she's like religious. So I just didn't tell her."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah that's yeah that's I can imagine that once that information gets out if that person doesn't hold it sacred and the end.
12819.0,Patient,They don't I know that the this they love to gossip they tell their parents and it just spreads around. like wildfire. wow.
120.0,Provider,"Well, you definitely have a tricky situation, though, but i'm glad you get to see your family."

12819.0,Patient,"I have in the past is that when I go there and it's dangerous because. My uncle could like do some of your test he could. Like if he knows this one person, one foot awaits me and then he would know that or am I said anyone could anyone can install the APP and it shows the distance so they will be like oh each right there yeah."
120.0,Provider,"No, I was like. You know I think in in response again to that question, we had or had earlier about you know what are you wanting in your life. Yes, it, you know if you're wanting a more secure relationship. You know you have to figure out how not to settle for these little flings."
12819.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"But you know I don't know it feels like to me then it's it can become a bit of an addictive pattern. Now, similarly to. The food, no."
12819.0,Patient,yeah I don't feel like it is yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know, but do you think that it just do you think that you get drawn into that because you feel lonely or. Because you don't want to think about other things in your life that are difficult to think about or what do you think it does for you to kind of you know, go back on these dating websites."
12819.0,Patient,"um. it's tricky for sure, like like depends every encounter is different, for example, the guys on Saturday, he was extremely attractive like I had a great time with him and. He also had some deeper conversation, but at the same time I knew that he's a flight attendant so he would never probably never see him, he was here for just a night. And I say Okay, I had a great time and I should have closed it on a good note, but on Sunday, I saw a guy, who is the opposite of him, who seemed attractive in his pictures, but when I met him I was like oh God what is that and. It was just so sad that he Why am I doing this. I that was probably an addictive pattern, and it is so but I know that it is that's why I stopped using it."
120.0,Provider,I know that's what you're trying to. yeah manage that differently so that you don't. Over use it for sure.
12819.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"And you said foods going, I mean you, you mentioned, using the ice cream, but in general, how are you doing with the door dash thing."
12819.0,Patient,"I don't know it is really idea okay so whenever I meet a guy whether it's good or bad, I always have ice cream after that. I don't know oh it's like a pattern. Luckily, I don't see them every day or even I just once a week so. I didn't I still do that as a comforting thing but door dashes like maybe once a week it's been not more than that, just wants to be can't. During pretty good other than that."
120.0,Provider,It sounds like you have made some progress there with. yeah number of times that you feel like you're losing control with food that you're. yeah yeah it.
12819.0,Patient,"Has it has really reduced and at first, I would feel shameful about eating like 4000 calories in a day, and then the following day I would eat 5000 but now, even if I eat like 3500 i'm like that's okay like because my maintenance is 3000 than I do so much i'm always cycling and then. yeah God, so I."

Maybe we could still meet, like every six weeks. or something like that. Like i'm leaving on the 14th or 15th of December, but on the 14th of December, I have a very huge exam so maybe you can meet like in the beginning of December, like the first week. of December, and then, after that, like late January, when I come back okay."
