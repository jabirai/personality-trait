10320.0,Patient,Can you hear me. Hello. Hello.
214.0,Provider,hey how are you.
10320.0,Patient,Good how are you.
214.0,Provider,i'm fantastic what's going on.
10320.0,Patient,what's going on let's see not too much just. holiday stuff. Last week I had to my grandma she had. Like a case of a fin. She went to the hospital for that and needed a peacemaker. I went out to visit her.
214.0,Provider,Stay very good.
10320.0,Patient,actually recovered.
214.0,Provider,Now it's a nice.
10320.0,Patient,"Nice to spend time with their. Good and. she's healthy, you know so she had a quick recovery. But I was there in Arizona for a few days last week. And then I came back, and it was a friend's birthday party so. went out and we partied and I stayed up late and. I didn't get. As much sleep, as I normally do. I was worried that it's going to affect me poorly but actually I felt alright, the next day, and I was able to get enough sleep, the following day and. I feel Okay, so far, so that's kind of surprising, you know because typically if I don't sleep well that makes me feel. Well yeah."
214.0,Provider,"But I mean this case in this case I think what you need to look at. Is if. just hear me out if everything linear is going well there's nothing open. No, no trepidation, or like I should job schooling testing. yeah it seems like you can get through it more likely, you know i'm saying."
10320.0,Patient,"yeah definitely yeah I didn't have like I didn't have big plans, the next day, you know, like stressing me out that I had like obligations to to be. Exactly mentally you know. Like sharp, for you know you, even though I got like less sleep and I was tired, the next day I wasn't like you know, stressing over. Anything big so that definitely helps and I think I was thinking, like the medication this new medication i'm taking was probably helpful for that too in preventing any like mood swings."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
10320.0,Patient,that's a good sign.
214.0,Provider,"Well, again, you have to look at and you need to be careful, you are. Your impacts may not necessarily be the same."
10320.0,Patient,mm hmm like I won't have the same results.
214.0,Provider,"Right so during school, you had one or two hiccups and you find your mood to be of snippy attitude like you knew there was a change. You were concerned that the same one happened and it didn't, but you have to look at that and say why didn't happen Oh, because everything has gone good yeah hey yeah so just we just put that in mind that if everything. Is on trajectory without you know things you can control. Then chances are you can probably do it as often as you like, but I think that. once or twice off. it'll be fine okay."
10320.0,Patient,"yeah that's a good point so that was just encouraging you know because I was worried about. That happening again, you know but. Especially like going into working soon if I ever have like a restless night. I worry right yeah it's affecting me for like my next shift. So, but that was reassuring, you know that maybe I could get by and and like still be okay."
214.0,Provider,And you did.
10320.0,Patient,And what else yeah so. Not too much else I got all my Christmas shopping done early.
214.0,Provider,"good for you, oh."
10320.0,Patient,yeah I don't have anymore and that's that's Nice.
214.0,Provider,"Okay okay good so listen this one survey do. Okay, and that survey is listing differently than. What it says, an adl survey, but the reality it's a. It is the. work ethic it's the week work, education, volunteering survey right yeah. So when you look at it it's in the patient forms and it's right on the chronic pain that one there's the only one that's do."
10320.0,Patient,How often do I need to do that one.
214.0,Provider,"I would say, every week."

10320.0,Patient,"Right yeah I was gonna bring that up you know once I start working I think i'd like to. Come to group, maybe once a month."
214.0,Provider,"So I wanted to change that now because i'd rather you be able to sell it no, no, we already addressed it them being like should we didn't address and what am I going to.

214.0,Provider,"It the whole, the whole thing here is, you need to remember is. um. You you you inherently need structure, yes, you can be responsible for yourself, yes, you can, but this will be an additional structure for film saying it's it'll be probably it would be like a little high impact. But it'll be structured right and and then, when you look back about this is all i've been waiting for schooling, the state exam it's here, so now you take the past that you apply it to the present plus what's the learning, it should keep you on a good direction."
10320.0,Patient,"yeah okay yeah well, then that sounds like good news, you know. And i'm looking forward to it's it's kind of like leading up to it, I still have. um let's see five weeks, maybe."
