15297.0,Patient,"Like a whole story you're going to hold, I want to say goodbye."
705.0,Provider,"When you're you know able what I go by us when you're more comfortable and you want to share it, and when you feel like that that's something you know. I appreciate what you did share because I it helps me understand a little bit more of the relationship and it sounds like it was more this time where you want it to separate and there's things that were done. That are still pretty fresh for you a lot of emotions are tied to it but that's your reason for right now, not wanting to be in a committed relationship with her. But on the other hand, you have history and you love her and that's the other side of it."
15297.0,Patient,"Very. Good very good. Ada. Like it's hard. Like I need to sit down with you in person I gotta go to. it's hard for me to like I said it takes, I will be here for hours talking I go on the whole period or talking about.

Ladies hearts minutes. Oh. Oh."
705.0,Provider,"you're doing really well able and something like a lot of times, is it can be to privacy issues like I know that that you're in the same household and like you said, if we were meeting somewhere, then that also could create that space. And as far as processing, as sometimes we don't know how we feel, because we have so many different thoughts coming around and that can change. You know a lot of times our emotions are tied to it and, one day, you may have a different outlook and different perspective on it and feel a certain way, and then a couple of days later, things may happen, and you fill in a different way. And until you say it out loud it doesn't like start to come clear. To the core it sounds like you and the baby's mama. Have her interest at best heart."
15297.0,Patient,"Oh yeah we. um. Is, which is very confusing, but I try my best to. come out what she does. I just try to have a. good relationship with the design world i've been to. I see my mom and dad buying go through a lot of stuff and. So my know how it is to the files and see that it did, I know that. And I just don't we both don't want for for the evening or on anything. So that we both agree on good if we if. We do good on on my co parenting. thing like we're a good that we're not going to go there, because I had to go to suffer family. family. Things like separate you learn and they're having a kufi stuff and I had to go every weekend with this memory there, and when I have to do this. And, and she was attempting, where she or her family is method to be she doesn't really have a big. family. Like events or party because. It was it was like that, but something happened and now they're no longer like really a family, people say. and So we both don't want to go so nothing like that, so we both agree that it's not saying nothing is angry well just have one. of everything and and make changes."
705.0,Provider,"Oh she's very fortunate to have you know you and your you know her mother. notice that and want to make a change to break that cycle of how that was free for you growing up as a child and for her mother to growing up as a child, and that you are creating something different you're making her life better."
15297.0,Patient,"Law practice even. If he's crying fasting. is going to live, but often. there's a very key very aware and. very pleased with yourself and. He shouldn't cheese cheese very sparse you know who's going on, she keep affair, with her and she'll get funding for what i'm doing. In. There so."
705.0,Provider,"You know a lot of times with when when you're sad is especially with children is that they can they can feel that and they want to make sure you know that hey that's okay and. go from there, but you know able, the way that you describe your little girl, and how much she means to you, I can tell that you're creating a safe, secure place for her you're very nurturing. what's coming up for you. What are some of your concerns."
15297.0,Patient,My. work. For.
705.0,Provider,"Life and what's what's you know connected to the sadness like what are some of the main things, or you feel sad. Is it trying to figure out more of your your relationships right now."
15297.0,Patient,You.
705.0,Provider,"able do you mind repeating that I want to make sure that I have it right, what you just said."
15297.0,Patient,I was.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I just wanted so that's part of what's coming up for you today. able i'm glad that you're sharing this and."
15297.0,Patient,I would be. So much for. You. Look.
705.0,Provider,"At able, you know a lot of times is holding on to that secret it comes out in other ways, and so just by giving yourself permission to share it. is setting the healing healing. emotion and I know that right now. That it's you know it's challenging and so i'm glad that you shared this with me and part of what will work on April is first getting you to getting some coping skills getting you grounded and stable and then being able to then. Work on the trauma piece and be able to make it where it, you know with trauma it's really hard, because when you have trauma happened in your life. You don't know how to respond, because it's traumatic it's something that doesn't shouldn't have taken place it wasn't your fault. And as a as a child. You didn't know what to do with it and so now as an adult you're you're left with all these unanswered, you know questions and where to go from there, and so this is a huge start for you. So thank you for trusting me and for sharing that. How how old, are you able. don't know how to think about it and and what to do and so now as an adult is that, first of all, you have the power to say something which you did. and being able to know you know again that this was in anything that you did it wasn't you know. It shouldn't have happened it did and it's like Okay, and now being able to to help you heal from this where you can move forward. there's there's different to able is there's different books and resources that will help you, and so what you and I will do is start where we're like today was a huge step you shared it. and be able to talk about you know first some of those coping skills and to get you where you're going to be able to work up to going through that to does that sound okay with you. It is you know something that. A lot of times people suffer in silence and so just like you had shared with your daughter, and that you had went through going to different houses and you didn't want that to go. You know to be something she experienced this is for you to that you're breaking this cycle, where normally people may suffer in silence. But you took a healthy risk today. It is your, then yes, you shared that you told your your girlfriend is this different than your baby's mother. Okay, so it's the same same person you just sometimes okay okay how how did it, you know for for you then enable given it, she was the first person you've told. Okay. Even though you're going through it right now, could you feel somewhat of a small release of the intensity of it. When you were able to just get it out and say it."
15297.0,Patient,Was quantum. psychology. there's. More and more. Like it used. To just be like going back from the lion on it would. Work everything that's going on. It.
705.0,Provider,"it's where when you push it back because it was something that you want it to just not talk about it, you pushed it back, and now that it's come to surface is it may able, you know, one of the first things I would tell you is. be kind to yourself and and know that this you know, while you're going through this difficult time. To be patient and to also get the support that you need and deserve. there's there's also able, and this is just in the future, where, if you feel like later on, you want support there's a lot of support groups. there's even where because it's it's very a lot of times there's men's group that they talk about it and it's a specialized where you feel maybe more comfortable in that setting."
15297.0,Patient,it up.
705.0,Provider,"And that would be you know, in addition to meeting and on individual basis."
15297.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"You know. Part of this too is being able to know that for it for today is that you are in process of starting to. Talk about it and and let go of it were a lot of times with trauma it's not that it's going to go away and it didn't happen, but it will, in time, it will lessen the intensity of this. Where you're able to come to terms and be like Okay, this is what happened but it's not going to stop my life. i'm going to maybe pause and work through it, but i'm going to move forward to because, like your your little girl and being able to focus on to you know things when it gets too heavy for you able is to be able to pull in the things to that can distract. Is that is, it is this something now that you've shared with her that you're thinking more often throughout the day. When when we talked last time, and you were sharing that you were depressed and sometimes it was hard to get out of bed is sometimes do you notice, if this is part of it that you've been thinking about the things didn't happen when you're younger. Okay. there's a good book to it's called the body keeps score and it talks about when trauma happens, especially when you're younger. That the body can you know, because if, especially if you don't talk about it, that the body, it comes out in other ways, and sometimes it can make were high blood pressure, sometimes more anxiety depression things like that can help to thats related to the trauma. yeah it's a it's a book and it's called the body keeps score i'll send you an email label. And then. For right now why you're going through this is, you know first i'm going to ask you to able, with if you know, in the past, you felt suicidal are you having any of those thoughts."
15297.0,Patient,Oh.
705.0,Provider,Yes.
15297.0,Patient,"Like. The value guys they. build on time. Or, like the I like before our. Life i'm scared I mean. i'm going to go back into the hospital I just don't want. To go back and for hospital. that's that's. That."
705.0,Provider,that's on that's on your mind.
15297.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Right, and you know with with that here's what i'll share with you remember when you and I first worked together and you created that safety plan. Okay, so what what I do evil is when we check in I always will ask you if you're having any feelings about self harm and if you can commit to. Not harming yourself, and you have a plan you can of course in sessions, what we do is talk about it, like, I have some before we're a person may say you know look. i've had thoughts of self harm, but I don't have a plan and there's no intent. If there's no plan and no intent than supporting you getting you to do some coping skills, if you share, though, that you have a plan. and your intent like you're writing a suicide note and you're going to do it then i'm going to get you the support that you need and deserve and then that would be talking to you about maybe going, you know, to get an assessment to see what's the best treatment for you. What, what do you think about what I just shared."
15297.0,Patient,yeah. know. hospital. I mean.
705.0,Provider,"Do you feel I cable that you know, sometimes. When i'm working with someone they say you know what actually maybe I can't keep myself safe and I want to go to the hospital to get more support and go into groups and things like that is is that something that you feel like you need to do."
15297.0,Patient,"don't. I don't feel like I. feel like anyone to be. To be taken away from. me I just I just don't want it, that I came back home, and my my diary for I was digging a hole, we were. Like we got. A. I get scared timing. i'm gonna i'm gonna go back in there. And I know. For three or four days for. Sure, give me longer so I don't."
705.0,Provider,"Right, and you know mo i'm here to support you and and if that's where you're saying I don't want to go to the hospital and if if you're. Sharing that we can come up with a plan and you're not actively suicidal where you're going to harm yourself, then we can talk about the other things if it is where you know you share that that you can't. You can't right now keep yourself safe, then, then we want, especially with trauma, sometimes it comes in waves, where a person may feel like that they they need, at that time. Would you be willing to able, you know so sometimes a step before let's say hospitalization if you can't keep yourself say. is sometimes is more in person and going and receiving from from reinhardt world line were more like an outpatient but going to somewhere on site where you're not staying there it's not the hospital it's more of an in person. it's an in person place where you go to groups and talk to a counselor. Is that something that you would be open to."
15297.0,Patient,yeah like a birthday. Better.
705.0,Provider,"yeah to me, to me, able to get you where I understand you don't want to be removed from your child you want to stay there, and it's so getting you to where you can still stay in your House. and see you know everyday your darter but getting you into treatment, where you're getting your needs met to where you can go in person. And so."
15297.0,Patient,"hey I get. I get like. Start filling that certain way, or like suicidal and depressed really just want i'm not high or a certain level because. honestly. Like that's why I went got sent to the hospital emergency room and I I tried to take a photo and it was. later found out. I feel like the we sometimes do they like, how they are is like that so that's why I try to take a pill. But, but really when i'm when i'm not high that's when I feel like you can like I said, sometimes I will be higher. o"
705.0,Provider,O clock when when you say you you feel depressed like today able do you have you know when you feel depressed do you have thoughts about killing yourself.
15297.0,Patient,"No, no, I just. Thought to. try not to do that every. Day, for they take care of my daughter every day well. Her mom goes to work, so I do again we're all dead. She can. Do it, she said, as I do, as you want. To call her like I really just don't have I don't have like. The energy like this recently I started doing like push that and they. Like doing in the hospital, but I just don't have the energy for driving energy, just like. Will. Not even. be like for like oh. yeah and it is hard at all that sometimes because you're right with physical activity."
705.0,Provider,"On days that you feel like you can, and you have energy then go for it do some push ups do some walking with your little girl, you probably get a lot of running around that that that's exercise too. But it will help you, with your dopamine you know that feel good neuro that neuro transmitter and it's good for your serotonin and to. If you're then you're not thinking of like there's no plan you're not going to take oxy cotton you don't have a plan for that with fentanyl."
15297.0,Patient,"No, I didn't know. I just wanted. To. Again I I didn't know I wasn't time."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so you were trying to escape from the feelings and maybe attached to the trauma and so you're wanting to just escape and not think about it, but you didn't know that there was spent in all in the opiate."
15297.0,Patient,yeah I didn't know it was.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
15297.0,Patient,I got sent I went they were get the room without them. I got my back my APP and it was it wasn't even positive for occupy that it just had Tyler on it. and family.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so so you and I, working together apple is. Part of it is, if you said that yes, you had plants and that you let's say you know, sometimes people will say yes Valerie I have. You know i'm going to take too many pills, I have the pills, and this is the day i'm going to do it then i'm going to step in and we're going to get you the support. What i'm hearing you say today able, is that you didn't know at the time when you took the pill that it had fentanyl and that. Right now you're not suicidal you don't have a plan you don't have like a day that you're going to try to do it you're not writing a suicidal suicide note or anything. class and then i'm hearing that you want to live, because you want to be part of your daughter's life."
15297.0,Patient,"yeah oh. I don't know. dad when you when you need them. or not, that Am I and her mom knows, not to not to have a doubt like after. We must have realized that that hasn't talking to the guys in that so. And neither does their sister. So I don't want them to whether that's one of the reason why even. With my referring to this point because I I didn't want to. They don't want to like a."
705.0,Provider,"Patient disconnected helping the patient reconnects waiting for patient to come back. Waiting for a patient to come back we'll also called patient. Calling patient to see if he can re enter. left a message for the patient is seems like we've become disconnected so far, the patient was sharing that he's not actively suicidal. His reasons for living as a starter so he'd been nice having a plan, he denies. Having like a set date or anything he's not collecting pills and share that the last time he ended up in the hospital, it was because he was taking pills to escape. From the feelings about the traumatic incident that happened when he was a child molestation so patient will hopefully get back to me. patient is back. that's Okay, I just want to make sure i'd reached up to the virtual cleaner, let me just let them know that you are back. Okay. Sometimes I know if you get a call or something to it will disconnect is that what happened. Oh Okay, you were able to plug it in. Okay. Are you. Are you able no worries i'm able, so you haven't plugged in, I just wanted to you know I know you're inside the House now, so what we talked about you would share that. No, no plan and things like that Do you remember when you and I first got together and we created together your safety plan. And that's where I had emailed it and you went through some things that you can do. i'm bringing up right now we're some of the internal coping strategies that you can do, and this is where to gauge it through the day if it gets to be. You know where you having some thoughts his video games or board games beyond your phone music and then you talked about playing with your daughter talking to your girlfriend playing poker on your phone. And then you had people that you could reach out to Joe hari Nicole your sister, and that also you could call bright heart health. yeah if anything changes able, and this is how you know you and I, working together, if anything, changes, where you have a brief moment that you think about doing something that would harm yourself, is to be able to reach out. The suicide hotline to that is the 988 number also to there's the 741741 is the text number or to call bright heart health to and just say you know I need to speak with our it's a crisis. Cry what we ask, though, is if it's an emergency, where you really feel like you can't wait and make that phone call and then wait through the virtual Center to go to the nearest emergency room if you need it. Okay, and what i'm hearing is you don't feel like today that you need to be in the hospital because you're is that is that, am I getting that right able. Okay okay what you were sharing to before we became disconnected. What I can do on this one, because able I feel like right now, because a lot has come up for you and you've been able to share, that is to get you. In person help or you can directly go to someone, and it will give you a safe space where you don't have to worry about. You know, being at home and what you're going to say and it gives you a disconnect we're okay i'm at the therapist room, this is what i'm going to be a little work on. On so what I can do on this enable is see with your insurance who you could get for in person. And a lot of times and i'm just going to be really transparent with you here's here's what may happen. So i'm going to see what we could do for higher level of care where you could do it in person, depending on your insurance. Sometimes they would allow you to continue to check in with bright heart health plus you do the treatment other insurance, you have to pick one or the other, so they would want you to do higher level of care in person and then come back to us for outpatient. Does that sound like something that you would be willing to do. yeah okay I you know I know that, with what you shared today takes it incredible carrot, you know courage to say it, and I know it may feel like you know now I shared it. This is a good thing, this is a good thing that you're able to you know as a kid you don't have the voice that you have today and you're able to say no, that wasn't right and today i'm going to heal from it i'm going to be able to continue on and learn how to manage this piece. Is that piece that that's a piece of your your childhood where. The intensity level by talking about it more and coming up with some word coping strategies. will make it where when you think about it, some of those strong feelings that you have attached will become lower in time it's just getting you right now able where you can talk about it and process it more and learn some coping skills that's best for you. So what I will do to then as our reach out the prescriber you're working with a shinto right. Okay i'll reach out to show and tell and let her know that what the plan is is looking for a higher level of care to support you. If you need to go do that first in person, then as soon as you're going to be discharged from working with them in person, then come back to us, and then you know, sometimes people utilizes it's like. Sometimes people will use the word aftercare as just like where you don't need maybe in person as much, and then you can come back and do this arena does that sound okay. yeah Okay, what are you going to do the rest of the day. Okay, so what kind of work, do you do. Why don't we do this to able, let me.

To keep where you're going to continue to get the support so it's going to take it usually to transfer to another place it's going to take, sometimes it may take a couple of weeks. And so we can get you in an in person can you work with us until that transfer where you're you're being supported. yep okay great so this will be online so tomorrow you'll meet with chantel at 7:15pm and then on Friday at eight o'clock am. First, go to the virtual Center and then you'll pop into the group, the Group we normally it's a pretty big group it's about 15 people, so what we do is usually do check ins any ups or Downs or challenges if you don't feel comfortable at all because usually it may take time. If you don't feel comfortable you don't have to share. You know."

705.0,Provider,"Right, I will be in that eight o'clock room."
15297.0,Patient,"yeah I was, I was there you. Are."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
15297.0,Patient,We are no no.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's normal when you join a group that sometimes you may not feel comfortable at first speaking, and so, if I if I ask a question, you can just say you know pass or are. i'll answer later, let me think about it, or just i'm not comfortable yet and i'll know because people are at their different paces in that group okay."
15297.0,Patient,"yeah all right, are you."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and then you and I will meet again on the 22nd and til 1030 until then able. In case something comes up because a lot of times to with trauma it might come out of nowhere if you get where you do feel like you're going to harm yourself do I have your verbal commitment that you would call and reach out for help. Okay, and you can you can utilize any of those resources that 988 number will connect you directly with the hotline. 741741 will get you where you can text a crisis counselor and this doesn't have to be only for prevention, it can be just if you're having a bad day you text your crisis counselor and they just say you know hey what's going on, it gives you another outlet. And then, if it's an emergency, by all means get yourself somewhere safe. Cry I think you for your honesty and I know that this has been you know, a challenge for you to share this and so able I can't tell you how much that I am. happy that you were able to share this and to start your journey to healing from it. And so my my goal is to get you the support that you deserve and need right now by getting you somewhere that's in person and we're going to see what place that can be. So the care navigator will look at your location and then see who your insurance pays or to get you an in person, where again it's not going to be a hospital you don't stay overnight, you would go there, you know. Sometimes for maybe four times a week, maybe more or less you'll have to talk to them. And then, once we do that, then we would transfer you probably and then you would come back to us for after care. And then to keep it going. Okay, but until we can make those that transfer to in person will keep you going virtual that that's okay with you. Okay, when I sent you to the safety plan, do you still have that. On your phone or somewhere where you can access it if you need it. Okay excellent those have those numbers on there for you to. Cry is there anything able before we go anything that you have questions about you need clarification or you want us to talk about."

705.0,Provider,"Is there you know I think what the able to a lot of times because it sounds like you're ready for this and that you're ready to just get it out. If you can jot down some of the things that you may want to talk about when we work together and then also when you go in person. Just if you can on your phone or a piece of paper jot down some of those things sometimes if a person wants to protect their privacy, you may put it down in a certain code that only you know what you're talking about so totally up to you, does that sound doable."
