243.0,Provider,"Well, number one I don't think you know, I think it could have been run a little bit differently, but it was hard with just one person helping run it, you know, while I was trying to get in so I can't complain."
10131.0,Patient,"Right now, and that wasn't my complaint at all, it was more so just I think I was so hurt just from. from going into yesterday because of the reschedule from from Rebecca on Sunday and trust me that's not the first time it's. What happens with her."
243.0,Provider,Was she need it they're not handling her schedule that it has something to do with. You know the care navigators not not getting it or something.
10131.0,Patient,She set up that appointment herself personal.
243.0,Provider,"yeah but then they don't get it, or something and then they say it's not there and."
10131.0,Patient,You know it's either way it's.
243.0,Provider,"A mess yeah it needs to be fixed I have made a complaint about it. what's going on, you know you, you took the day or you have Mondays off no."

243.0,Provider,Oh really why.
10131.0,Patient,"Because they sent me home last week on a coca Protocol seven day code protocol because someone was in the office that that that tested positive and who was actually quite sick and. So they sent me home, and that was fine I did their whole protocol went and got their test and have the negative result and I was supposed to return to work yesterday and I got a message from. Someone who's not even my supervisor saying that. Just no need to come to the safety meeting this morning, or no safety meeting just come to the office at nine and I just drove by the Office and everyone's fucking there. So it's like there's no reason, if they weren't having a safety meeting, then there wouldn't be any one there. So I don't know."
243.0,Provider,"So, are you supposed to come in today."
10131.0,Patient,yeah going at nine.

243.0,Provider,"Well, what would make them want to fire you what, why do you think that."
10131.0,Patient,Only because of nothing adds up. I mean like like I said i'm trying to keep my cool and that.
243.0,Provider,yeah because that's catastrophic thinking.

243.0,Provider,yeah you will that's what we're trying to work on.
10131.0,Patient,"You yeah but we're not really doing anything, with all due respect, I mean we get in there, and when it was a smaller group, there was a lot of progress to be had because there's more."
243.0,Provider,"yeah well, we need to not do a check in like that. We need to just get right to the content, which we used to do."
10131.0,Patient,And I don't like the content. I. don't want. People.
243.0,Provider,Like content is resistance.
10131.0,Patient,I mean i'm willing to work on it that's not what i'm saying it's just it was when we were had a group of let's say half of that.
243.0,Provider,yeah well yesterday was an odd number we don't typically have you know you haven't been in there yesterday we've we've never had that much.
10131.0,Patient,Right and it's it's like when you're in there and you're getting to know these people and. You know you're trying to be empathetic to their time and.
243.0,Provider,"yeah you in you do a good job with that yeah yeah well listen, I will take your your comments to Rebecca and we'll talk about better strategies she's been able to handle larger groups, she just it's something when weird yesterday so."
10131.0,Patient,"Anyway, yeah."
243.0,Provider,"Well, what can I do for you today."
10131.0,Patient,"um, I just wanted to talk about the whole medication thing and see where where we're going and because basically from. I mean something's gotta change because right now i'm out of it i'm just loopy I mean I can't remember a damn thing um. it's i'm just block unless it's in the morning, when I take my medication and I told you, I was taking differently and i'm not supposed to be doing that, until I talk to you and all of that."
243.0,Provider,"Well, you can take more than 60 a day and we already have pledged that you know."
10131.0,Patient,that's rv yeah that's already false because you can't go more than that.
243.0,Provider,"corey you know you're using it sort of like an abuser and you just can't do that I will they'll cut my my ability to even prescribe it to you. So, right now, you get at around 30 twice a day that's the Max dose and I was nice enough to say okay let's give you an extra 20 we probably should just done 10 for midday only if you need and."
10131.0,Patient,When we talked about that Mary you are very appreciative of my feedback and you agreed with everything that I had to say about why I would need that medication midday. This wasn't all my doing well that's why I started to get pissed off. Because this isn't the shit that I signed up for.
243.0,Provider,But corey That is why I agreed to give it to you.
10131.0,Patient,"it's been about not and you only gave me the other one, so you."
243.0,Provider,"never said not to worry i'm going to continue what we plan, but I can't go higher and you have."

243.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I thought you were asking me to go to three."
10131.0,Patient,Not at all.
243.0,Provider,"30 X ours. And you said you were taking 330 X ours, and I said that is over the top."
10131.0,Patient,Right we're doing the two in the one. and changing.
243.0,Provider,Okay well that's okay with me I.
10131.0,Patient,missed with the. diebold pro X and the zoloft and the gabba penton.
243.0,Provider,"It was a dive out pro X is a mood stabilizer and it's helpful for your anger, the gap of penton is for anxiety and you don't have to take that it says as needed. and your. sertraline is an Anti depressant do you feel like it's doing anything for you."
10131.0,Patient,Not a damn thing more depressed than i've ever been in my life.
243.0,Provider,What do you want to go up on it to one and a half.
10131.0,Patient,know is that the answer though I mean.

10131.0,Patient,Okay isn't 13 different medications and different things.
243.0,Provider,"Will you take the medicine that you're on to the fullest before you make a change. And right now, are you taking one develop products or two."
10131.0,Patient,I stopped that just recently. It doesn't seem like any I mean something has to change because.
243.0,Provider,"i'm not even well that's what you know i'm talking about taking it into your own hands dive out proxies for your anger and for your mood stabilization it's also for the traumatic brain injury, as is the extra adderall that's why I, I was what do you call lenient in allowed that. As needed dose of adderall because of the traumatic brain injury."
10131.0,Patient,"And then we were going to do, like. All these problems are not promises, but things that were supposed to be done. or not being done."
243.0,Provider,What are you talking about.
10131.0,Patient,"You told me, you were going to go to the director and do all this."
243.0,Provider,I did I did talk to the director and I told them what we were doing. yeah and I got a consultation from him and that's why we've added the medication we added. And I talked to you about going to him.
