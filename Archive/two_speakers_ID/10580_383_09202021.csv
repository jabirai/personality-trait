383.0,Provider,"Okay well do you feel like your self esteem is connected to your weight, or do you feel like self esteem is connected to other things."
10580.0,Patient,"Well, I used to think that it was connected to my weight, but now that i'm gaining weight it's like is not connected because I felt like losing weight would increase it, but now that i'm gaining weight my self esteem is at the same time increasing, not because of my weight, but because. i'm calmer now."
383.0,Provider,i'm so glad.
10580.0,Patient,yeah like what I mean is that i'm gaining weight and even though i'm gaining weight my self esteem is increasing.

10580.0,Patient,I kind of forget to do that.
383.0,Provider,"yeah that's a good tool, you know just to pause like look at a tree, like the one that's right behind you have a pretty tree out there and. Clean yeah and like take some deep breaths and just feel the breeze you know. And just. kind of disconnect a little bit from. Maybe your thoughts and go into just feeling the breeze and taking some deep breaths and and just kind of coaching yourself you're telling yourself you're going to be okay you'll get through this everything's gonna be fine."
10580.0,Patient,I actually feel what that wonders breeze I feel calmer when i'm outside and there's breeze. yeah I just love it and I feel really calm when the breeze hits me.

10580.0,Patient,"yeah I love it here, and I also think that my mood has to do a lot, now that i'm like analyzing because I don't sit and analyze myself, but now that i'm doing it because i'm in the session that a lot has to do, because I moved in with my boyfriend."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
10580.0,Patient,"And this new place where i'm at has doesn't have a negative energy, like the other used to have."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
10580.0,Patient,The other places where I used to live alone that's where we have most of our fights and where I will get aggressive and the whole mass would happen. At that place.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10580.0,Patient,And I feel like I left that negative energy there.
383.0,Provider,"Good. Good and you know i'm glad you feel that way i'm glad you feel more positive and the space that you're in now. And you're aware that inside of you sometimes aggression might bubble up. yeah and so when that happens when you start to notice it very at the very beginning, is when you want to do your your you know. you're coping skills, you know step outside that take a walk take a take some deep breaths think about. You know all the all the things that you have going for you, you know you've got your job you've got your love of animals you've got your you know your education, these are all really These are big strengths, that you have."
10580.0,Patient,yeah now that i'm gonna be busier much busier and have less time to think about negative things I feel like.
383.0,Provider,You know right. Now we be grooming dogs and cats. Okay.
10580.0,Patient,"And it's my first time as a groomer not a groomer but a grooming assistant. So i'm excited because I don't I I know the side of animals, like that and health, but I don't know the side of grooming. yeah so i'm really excited."
383.0,Provider,"that's so nice. well. I think being excited being. about your what you're doing feeling good about it, you know those are all positive emotions, you know. That helps that helps you get up that helps you move forward in your day to day, and hopefully the sleep problem will start to subside when you are busier and you're really tired at the end of the day, you know and just fall asleep into a deep sleep."
10580.0,Patient,"Excuse me yeah i'm. yeah i'm working on that with my with my psychiatrists tanya. She started me again on the pills, because I stopped taking them though nightmare pills and we're going to start increasing the dosage cuz I feel like I just need a bigger dosage."

10580.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so what was your question that you had for her again."
10580.0,Patient,"If I should start taking a whole transmitting pill, instead of half."
383.0,Provider,And is it the 50 milligrams that's the whole pill.
10580.0,Patient,yeah i'm taking half the pill.
383.0,Provider,So you're only taking 25 milligrams.
10580.0,Patient,Wait let me check. let's see. Oh it's 50 yeah so i'm taking 25.
383.0,Provider,"So, but you're prescribed 50."
10580.0,Patient,i'm 25.
383.0,Provider,You prescribe 25.
10580.0,Patient,But the tablet is 50.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, I do you want me to send her a note. That you're wondering if you can take 50 instead of 25."
10580.0,Patient,"Yes, please."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, if she's available, maybe she'll she can answer during while we're here. you're cutting your posts in half. And you're waking up in the night."
10580.0,Patient,At 4am and through the night i'm waking up like three times okay.
383.0,Provider,"Okay we'll see if she is available to respond, otherwise I encourage you to make an appointment with her. Okay yeah. So is there anything else that you wanted to talk about."
10580.0,Patient,"No, I think i'm good just that i've improved."
383.0,Provider,"that's great great, and I think that you know doing these coping skills, you know getting to your class early if you're like coping ahead in that way also doing the deep breathing like reflecting on all of the positive things that you're doing that are your strengths, I mean. You know you have a line of study that you really love that's a strength you've got a job that's a strength, these are the when you have these strengths are more secure and so when you go into your relationships. You you feel more secure with yourself. yeah and that brings. You know, in a way. it's a better foundation to relate to other people."
10580.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,"That makes sense. yeah yeah so when you start to feel insecure, or you start to feel that. Maybe. Those not good feelings in your relationship just kind of remind yourself to about your own strengths, you know and then doing the deep breathing getting outside getting fresh air maybe taking a walk to calm down if you start to notice yourself going into that anger aggression mode."
10580.0,Patient,yeah okay.
383.0,Provider,"And if there is something that you need to communicate with your partner, you can you can communicate that from a calmer place. Okay, because they're they're maybe they're often are things that we need to communicate and talk about you know in relationships. Okay, all right, so you ready to make your next appointment, then."
10580.0,Patient,"Oh yeah let me know. cuz now I have classes and i'm less available, you know. i'll make like a the appointment, but i'm probably going to end up changing it so."
383.0,Provider,"You just want to call in and make it, or should we make it now and that."
10580.0,Patient,"Make it now, because I will forget."
383.0,Provider,little bit slow today.
