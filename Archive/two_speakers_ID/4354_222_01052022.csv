Okay, and I told him no I didn't know you know back in the old days yeah i've know somebody. But now I had no I don't know of anybody that messes with him, so it didn't that I told him that and. I didn't see him for a week or two. And I saw him a week or two later and he asked me again. that's megan. hmm and. I don't know why. I don't know why I said it, but I said i'll take some of."
222.0,Provider,I take a view of.
4354.0,Patient,uh huh so I did.
222.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4354.0,Patient,"Okay, I got maybe 10 of them. So I took. I took those I I took my mouth I didn't you know snore them or anything what people do I didn't do any of that. and Did you take them one, at a time. yeah. Well, I took. To 10 milligrams at a time. And um. And he told me that he got him every now and again so about a week later, a couple days later hey come back and I got more um and."
222.0,Provider,And were you saying is an error. or suboxone or something type during this time. yeah okay.
4354.0,Patient,"Yes, not at the same time. yeah that the same time, but when those run out i'd go back to my. marks and and I wasn't having any problem because I wasn't taking them long enough. Okay, I wasn't taking them, but for you days. uh huh so. On the next time he came I got some 30s from him. Okay 30 milligram."
222.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4354.0,Patient,"And I noticed something different about them right from the star. Okay um I noticed that it was like different makeup. Of the drug it it felt kind of the same, but I knew something was different, they were stronger."
222.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4354.0,Patient,"And um after after I took those I got more of them and I got more of them and within within I don't know, three weeks hours right back. Every day."
222.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4354.0,Patient,"taken them every day within three weeks. Or maybe even less than that it might have been even less than that. Okay, and. So. When the beginning to December came. yeah. I was just sick I was already state. Of of it already."
222.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4354.0,Patient,"And so I had been on for a couple weeks, every day, and I said i'm done with this i'm going to try to. Take my suboxone. And I did that I took my soapbox and before I went to sleep. One night and already had a couple of hours 35 milligrams."
222.0,Provider,You know.
4354.0,Patient,"During that day. You know, so I took this box in and I slept in my bed and couldn't sleep was restless by me and it was like, and I mean within 45 minutes, I felt like I was. gonna draw. yeah yeah So the first thing I did woke up the next morning. and got more of them to to get off of that too, so I could get that off of me."
222.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4354.0,Patient,"And by that time like I said by that time I was already tired of it. yeah, then I knew I wasn't going to be able to do it. and be able to go to work and stay at work, I tried it on the weekend I tried not taking them and get them back on my soapbox and on the weekend. yeah that way I would be ready to go back Monday morning to work. yeah that didn't work either that didn't work either so that's when I decided that I was going on, because I remember when when I started at the methadone clinic um it didn't have any effect like that. I could, I could take the pill, and then go straight to in the morning and take the methanol, and it didn't make me sick. So that's what I did, and as soon as I took that within two or three days I was, I was awesome."
222.0,Provider,"yeah tell me again in the transition, so you were using on one day, and then you went to the methadone clinic like the following day."
4354.0,Patient,"yeah I was using them and i've been doing them, for now, a month and a half."
222.0,Provider,yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"you're a month and a half. and I went, I decided to go to the the methadone clinic. Okay, I went to the methadone clinic and within two days. You know dosing. As a methadone clinic I thought. Okay completely. Okay, and they started me off, they started me off, I think it 30. yeah 30 milligrams and I worked myself up to 35 within a week. Okay, I mean 40 pounds. Okay, and yeah within within a couple of days within like two days. yeah I was like I wasn't taking them anymore. Okay, and. And I haven't since. That was on. The week before Christmas week that that that happened."
222.0,Provider,That I did that yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"And i'd already noticed, I was. My money was getting funny I mean I was. I hadn't bought all my Christmas and I was getting ready to be in trouble with my Christmas money."
222.0,Provider,uh huh.
4354.0,Patient,It happened at the right time.
222.0,Provider,"Okay, for that yeah."
4354.0,Patient,Though and so i've been going there. Every every morning at six o'clock. yeah before I go to work. yeah and and taking that Dutch.
222.0,Provider,Okay okay.
4354.0,Patient,And I haven't I haven't I haven't had a peel. yeah and I guess 233 weeks.
222.0,Provider,um as that neighbors coming around.
4354.0,Patient,"I told him he i've known him for a long time. um I told him don't ever. Come back down here with within things in your pocket now I don't. want I don't want to hear about him, I want you to call me about him. yeah I want you to walk down here and say I got him and he agreed to he would never do it. Okay again so. Good he has it and he he hasn't been back down."
222.0,Provider,"And when you were using were you getting high at all, are you feeling highs."
4354.0,Patient,yeah.
222.0,Provider,"Well, under 30."
4354.0,Patient,"i'll tell you why yeah yeah well. i'll tell you why what happened just this week. I got the results of my. My drug test that I took at the methadone clinic. Okay, and isn't it, it was fitting all. They were all fentanyl fields. um so and I, and I knew something was different. You know, when I started attacking him I said they don't feel right at all."
222.0,Provider,yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"You know little bit stronger and it and I, and I was it was it was getting me it was yeah it was making me it would get me hi."
222.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"So, and I knew something was different about him it wasn't like a regular teen or five milligram. I knew that something was different about him and I in the back of my mind I said man. You know you really don't know what to take, and when you bottom like that off the street, so I thought in the back of my mind I said, these could be fitting all. right and it is what it was, is exactly what it was."
222.0,Provider,"yo yo. um. And, did you tell your buddy that."
4354.0,Patient,Yes. I mean. I told him I said I don't know what I don't know if you know. I said but. You think you selling ox code arms and you're not. you're selling deadly could be deadly you know. I told him. And he called his he called the guy that he got them from.
222.0,Provider,and tell him yeah yeah.
4354.0,Patient,And that guy said he didn't care he said he didn't care what it was you know that's the way they do you know.
222.0,Provider,Right not.
4354.0,Patient,Not my neighbor but the other guy my neighbor he was a little bit concerned but. The guy he got him from he wasn't concerned at all.
222.0,Provider,yeah and. Towards the end where you still swallowing them you weren't snorting or.
4354.0,Patient,"No, I was, I never have. Okay, never do."
222.0,Provider,Never before either years ago. No okay.
4354.0,Patient,"nope never did. Okay, I always took them by my house."
222.0,Provider,Always yeah my mom have you been on methadone before me.
4354.0,Patient,Yes. A long time ago yeah.
222.0,Provider,"So, how was D, did you switch from methadone to be an orphan therapy before."
4354.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm the when I was, I was on methadone, for I guess. Maybe two years. Okay, and the place the place that I was getting it from."
222.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4354.0,Patient,"They they were stopping with that and going to the suboxone. Okay, and so one day, so one day I was taking methadone and the next I was getting my prescription of suboxone and tackle box. The next time i'm not there was no dark. I mean, I mean 30 milligrams of methadone every day. yeah and then the next day. i'm one or two suboxone the day."
222.0,Provider,Did you have what y'all that day.
4354.0,Patient,"I did not it didn't bother me I don't know if it's supposed to. With methadone I don't know, maybe it is, but it didn't then."
222.0,Provider,"Okay, so typically what. goes yeah well so here's the thing so methadone is very long acting and it's a full opioid agonists like it fully activate the receptor so it's different than suboxone. And raw but still suboxone will displace methadone and because it's a full opioid it can make people feel withdrawal and because it's long that's. really hard for people to. Transition now you when you were on 30 milligrams before that may have been part of why it was easier usually we want to get you down to at least. 30 milligrams so if you're on 45 now we want to get you down to at least 30 and then have you on that for like a week, then the guidelines are to come off the methadone and most people. have to go like. Four days, sometimes without anything, besides i'll give you like clonidine we'll take tylenol like things to help you with anxiety because that's what most people feel some anxiety as they're waiting to start suboxone. What you have to feel is withdrawal symptoms like you need to feel some amount of sweating restlessness nausea headache you know. All of the. And then you start at a tiny dose of suboxone make sure it didn't. Get you into withdrawal and then do another. dose or later. So the way you did it before is not typically the way people are done i'm happy to. So what i'll need to do you know from here, we can't just start you we've got to coordinate with the methadone clinic so they kind of know the plan and talk about you know tapering you. To 30 milligrams a week, which I don't think you'll have any problem with that and, and you can start on the clonidine right away with them people take quantity and, like every six hours or so if they're feeling anxious those drop your blood pressure, a little bit. So if people start with low blood pressure, just watch that you're not getting dizzy or light headed and then sometimes people get muscle aches as they lower their dose so they'll take tylenol kind of around the clock. You know, but like 500 a few times so that you're taking about two grams for the day and that's safe with liver histories and everything to that two grams. And then, if you have anything else going like nausea or stuff that happens, we can treat that as well, but. Tell me why. You want to switch. I mean lots of people have their reasons, I just want to know why you want to switch from the methadone."
4354.0,Patient,Well i've been on the suboxone for so long. And I did I did well with it um up until recently. I just I don't know i've. it's been so long since i've been on methadone um I just always like the suboxone for one because. I like to be able to. Take one in the morning and then one in the evening.
222.0,Provider,yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"You know I like to. I like to have that, because sometimes like even now i'm feel I need to take something at night I get I don't know if it's because it's in my mind, or because i've been doing it for so long. But at night, I still wanna I want to take if I had some evidence I would take you know."
222.0,Provider,But.
4354.0,Patient,"yeah I don't give it out like that you just get it one time so right. um that's one of the reasons and plus i've been I was on it for so long and I always did really it was it was always really good and it worked. um I think. I think what happened to me was curiosity got me. A little bit this this time because that's the first time i've ever used i'm sense. Since I got on it so. I don't know why I did it but. I think I think I would be better on this box and. Honest yeah and. Another thing is, I have to go every morning there and that's the way it is you know, there is no I mean you can get take homes and all that but. I don't think I would do better on the spot."
222.0,Provider,"Okay okay um yeah all of that makes sense, have you been able to work through all of this."
4354.0,Patient,yeah I haven't missed a day. I didn't miss a day.
222.0,Provider,And how are they monitoring you there do they make you do urine drug screens.
4354.0,Patient,i've done one.
222.0,Provider,Okay.
4354.0,Patient,"I think they do them I think they do them every once a month, so I should be coming up from one within a week or so I would imagine. Only taken one so far one. Car and. They said that they said that the fentanyl that was in my system. may still be in my system when I take the next."
222.0,Provider,One yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"Because they said it, I guess it."
222.0,Provider,goes on reason they.
4354.0,Patient,said long lasting long urine so.
222.0,Provider,it's a nice to be. In your fat cells basically.
4354.0,Patient,Right yeah that's what she said yeah.
222.0,Provider,"yeah so let me have you sign a release for the methadone clinic and all reach out to them There is one other way, so people do this thing called micro dosing sometimes which. You know, given that you did well before switching it's a different way, but i'd have to make sure it's Okay, with the methadone clinic it's where we actually start you on. Some suboxone or some buprenorphine while you're taking the methadone little amounts and taper you down some people find that that helps them tolerate it better, but they're not. You know tapering and then having to wait all that time, not if you experience more withdrawal, then we can't do it that way everyone's body is a little bit different. But i'll ask them if they allow that you know, and if we can coordinate care that way so. yeah do you see a Doc there ever new ever see anybody."
4354.0,Patient,"Will. Did um I saw him at the beginning um uh. i'll hang out if i'm there another month or something like that I think i'll have to see him for something but i'm not really sure yeah because it's so it's so new to me right now i've only been there, a couple weeks so. Okay, I really don't know what's going goes on yeah absolutely true, but I imagine i'll have to see him again yeah it's got the week."
222.0,Provider,"Okay, and then coming back into breakout healthy you. Your group was this time right was it Tuesdays 830."
4354.0,Patient,yeah. Oh yeah my group was on Tuesdays at seven.
222.0,Provider,"at seven okay. So next week plan on coming at seven but. i'll reach out tomorrow, you know, to the methadone clinic and see if I can might take them, you know another day or so, to get the doctor call me back. So just for now just stay on your dose if there's anyone clinical you see in the morning, you can mention. hey my docs you know my suboxone docs going to try to contact you i'm going to try to get back on suboxone and you can even ask them like Can I take her at all, they could maybe at least give you 40 or something so we start getting closer to the right dose."
4354.0,Patient,Okay.
222.0,Provider,"yeah and then, when we get this setup and actually since you might even taper tomorrow i'm going to send that clonidine prescription in so you can start that you probably won't need it very much until you're actually tapering a little more in starting but it'll be there and. You do have it's basically for anxiety feelings agitation feelings, as you lower a little bit so that one will be there, and if you get anybody aches take tylenol."
4354.0,Patient,Okay.
222.0,Provider,And Christine said hello to so.
4354.0,Patient,He was.
222.0,Provider,saying he was glad to hear you're coming back.
4354.0,Patient,"And yeah I almost I almost emailed her as well, but. um I said I said now i'll just wait to see what's gonna happen, what if i'm gonna get if i'm going to be able to come back then i'll just talk to her then. But I emailed her when I email G so yeah."
222.0,Provider,"Right, you know you were on monthly by this point so sometimes it takes us a little while to realize that you hadn't been there, you know yeah. Ross every week we just think is this rod news week or maybe not."
4354.0,Patient,Right.
222.0,Provider,"i'm trying to look at when. She saw you, you did individual therapy November 30 so you this was probably around when that was kind of starting right."
4354.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah it was around around the same time, and I didn't say anything."
222.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"I should have, but I was."
222.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, please don't beat yourself up too much you this is a good learning lesson you got right back on track, so."
4354.0,Patient,Hopefully we'll be able to make.
222.0,Provider,"This transition back to the suboxone. Do you feel running all I know you and I have. gotten up and down a little on your doses, and we can do that again. When I first met you, you were saying you had been on to a day, but that you always felt cravings and then I bumped you up a little, but then you wouldn't always use it, and then you would wind up with. activating you think, do you think that has anything to do with it at. All that maybe if you stayed on the. 20 milligrams like the little bit higher dose that you wouldn't. You might not have. This interest when someone offers it to you."
4354.0,Patient,um I don't I don't. I don't I don't know I don't know I don't think so.
222.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
4354.0,Patient,"think that that's the way it was but i'm be honest with you, I don't know why. I did it was so stupid. I don't know I just but I don't think that that was I don't think that had anything to do with it."
222.0,Provider,"yeah. You feel almost like it was impulsive like he came over the second time, and you were like just give me some."
4354.0,Patient,"right and it was like and then I thought about it, I had a man, I thought about it and also what are you doing ra. yeah and. And, and my wife, she said, what are you doing."
222.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"And I said I don't know that I mean he asked me um you know. it's been so many years, I I said. I take these and it won't be no problem."
222.0,Provider,You know.
4354.0,Patient,And that wasn't the way it was so.
222.0,Provider,"Right right well just be glad to that you're safe that the fentanyl wasn't an overdose and anywhere in there, and you know you're okay so yeah. I didn't want to is a new year."
4354.0,Patient,Right. yeah yeah that Dan.
222.0,Provider,"And I bet you are spending some money, so you know that's another good reason not to."
4354.0,Patient,Know i'ma be honest with you i'm. Almost 1000 miles a week.
222.0,Provider,yeah yeah that's a nice change that. You have in your pocket yeah.
4354.0,Patient,"I mean it was. It some weeks it was close to that, I mean it got it was good it got it went from one day, just a few to the next day, having a have. Six of them."
222.0,Provider,"yeah. And just so I don't forget to ever say this, if you ever do relapse first of all, you can always tell us. Second, of all we would help you with that transition back so i'm not saying it's easy it's not as easy as just getting methadone right away, but. way you did it you set yourself up to withdraw, so you do need to wait if you're ever you know if you ever taken opioid again you have to wait till you're in physical withdrawal feeling multiple symptoms of withdrawal and then, when we give you quantity in and. Time the same we're going to do now and then you take a tiny bit of the medicine. That way, an hour, you can take a little bit more and a few hours later, you can take a minute, you know it can bump up quickly, but you want to make sure you don't make. yourself dope sick."
4354.0,Patient,I took a. I got to three quarters of one or almost a whole one. yeah and I had been. I had been probably five four or five hours from taking one.
222.0,Provider,Oh gosh.
4354.0,Patient,"And I had been day so. I mean it's like 45 minutes and on and on, I know that they're there that that is."
222.0,Provider,happening.
4354.0,Patient,"is made to do that and. And that's what it does, but I didn't think about it, and I did definitely didn't think it was going to happen, like that. yeah, but it did and. It was it was. It was, I mean it made me feel like a years ago is what it is just reminded me of withdrawing years ago. Right right toda la. It I was I wasn't expecting it like that, I thought, maybe a few cold deals or something like that. Right, it was full on full on. Raw so. It wasn't good. But. But now I guess i'm gonna have to go through it somewhat I don't. I really don't remember when I started on suboxone I don't think I had any withdrawals from methadone to the next day suboxone."
222.0,Provider,Okay that's great that's all.
4354.0,Patient,I believe I didn't I don't think I had any problems.
222.0,Provider,I don't know yeah.
4354.0,Patient,That was long time ago long time ago.
222.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah so i'll talk to the methadone clinic and see if they're able to do this way if we can try it this this way, and you don't have any problems, then great then we're good. But but i'll talk to i'll try to reach out to them. If you don't hear from me, you know by because today is Tuesday i'll reach out Wednesday if they get back to me, or if you don't hear from. me back through the virtual clinic because i'll send a message them and say hey let patient know that you know we're start i'm going to prescribe if they do it basically if they allow us to do it then i'll be prescribing. The buprenorphine to start because we don't want them to lock zone, because that's like a Blocker so we just want to use the people in orphanage and will increase. Basically, every day you'll start a low dose while you're on the methadone and then the next day you'll double that and it'll take about a week to get you to your a good buprenorphine dose and then you would just stop. The mountain so if they let you do that that's what i'll be sending the prescription with instructions and have the virtual clinic reach out to you. But if you don't hear from me by Friday, you know, send a message to the virtual clinic and see what you know just say I haven't heard anything so that this way, maybe i'm waiting to hear from your methadone clinic I don't know."
4354.0,Patient,So okay okay.
222.0,Provider,But is that.
4354.0,Patient,The way that sounds like that sounds like a good plan. yeah the. The the beautiful an orphan.
222.0,Provider,yeah that's.
4354.0,Patient,A good point.
222.0,Provider,"it's called micro dosing it's a little newer than the old way I was saying so. someplace yeah hey allow at some places may not, but we can see."
4354.0,Patient,"Okay, all right. If I don't write from me if I don't hear from me, I will get in touch with the virtual clinic by Friday."
222.0,Provider,Okay. sounds good and i'm going to have them send your release tonight. Hopefully. So that don't have you signed that so I can reach out.
4354.0,Patient,Okay.
222.0,Provider,"All right, rodney a new year."
4354.0,Patient,Thank you. Happy New Year to you okay bye bye Thank you.
222.0,Provider,"For transcription so rodney cadel please put that he had returned to use after he had been on suboxone therapy had been in bread heart health. had been doing well and have been moved to monthly, unfortunately, he said, a neighbor came over offered him percocet. came back he declined said came back a week later, he is unclear why he said yes, so that was just an impulsive Yes, he took 10. started on those they were 10 milligrams he would take two at a time so 20 milligrams several times a day. said it went quickly and then he would continue taking a savvy tech or his suboxone in between doses he wasn't having any problems with withdrawal. He then was given some 30 milligrams he thought of oxycodone he said right away, they felt very different and that he quickly escalated and was taking 30 milligrams multiple times a day and every single day, not on his suboxone anymore started missing didn't come for his follow up group. At the beginning of December so within a few weeks, he felt sick of all of this, he tried to get back into suboxone. took about he thinks maybe eight milligrams of suboxone all at once, four to five hours after taking 30 milligrams of. The what he thought were oxy cones went into precipitated withdrawal felt sick all night went back on the. opioid try it again over the weekend, when he didn't have to go into work had the same response so then he went right before Christmas to the methadone clinic had taken. What he thought with oxy cohen's on one day and the following day went to the methadone clinic without any issues he was at 30 milligrams and increased up to 45 milligrams within two days wasn't using any more. of his opioid pills, he said, the whole time he had been swallowing them did not crush nor or inject. No overdose he said that his urine drug screen from the methadone clinic came back showing fentanyl so he realized that what he had been taking was not oxycodone but actual fentanyl pills. He has told this neighbor has set boundaries with him and said, please never bring anything again i'm in recovery, his wife is supportive of this. We did discuss in the past, he had been on methadone and apparently the methadone clinic had switched to suboxone and, one day, he was taking 30 milligrams nothing on the next day suboxone without any issues, so I am hopeful that he can do this transition, however. You know, there are there can be difficulties, given the long acting nature of methadone and the need for possible withdrawal symptoms, to have a start, the suboxone. or two methods to consider here, one would be the traditional where we have him taper at the methadone clinic to 20 to 30 milligrams of methadone daily for a week. And then third about at least 36 sometimes 72 hours up to 96 hours after last dose of methadone with multiple signs of withdrawal. Which correlates to the cows score then starting low dose suboxone and increasing as tolerated without any signs of withdrawal. The other method could possibly be micro dosing and i'm going to reach out to the methadone clinic to see if they would possibly allow us and be in support of this. He could start tapering as we start increasing buprenorphine at the same time, and when he reaches ideal between orphan dose stop the methadone. So i'm going to a patient sign a release of information, so that I may reach out to the methadone clinic and see if we can coordinate care and hopefully get him back in his suboxone treatment alright so that's it Thank you diagnosis severe opioid use disorder, thank you for transcribing."
