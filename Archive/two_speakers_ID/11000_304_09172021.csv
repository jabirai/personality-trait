I used to like you know, I was the type that would start like three different projects and then I would get all confused and then it would take me super longer to finish on. Now I just tried to start one project at a time and then go from there, and it seems to work better, I you know I kind of overwhelm myself, I think. And I definitely am hard on myself when I do stupid stuff and I think that's why I get angry a lot with myself. Because we saw people back, and I was thinking about it even looking at my baby pictures like I was always mad, even in my baby pictures, I was always crying my mom said I didn't let no one touch me. Like it's like I don't I don't know why I have that in me and sometimes I just I can't I can't control it, but it's really hard I just."
304.0,Provider,"Like just a high sensitivity. Right like you're saying, remember, even as a baby that things just bothered you a lot."
11000.0,Patient,"Right right. Even a little child I remember, I mean I even I always liked being alone to you know I kind of you know I I like to be left alone. You know i'm yeah i'm not like a bully or anything you know I leave everybody alone, but if you come in my way and, like kind of get in my way and bother me i'll push you out, you know I I don't let anybody in are getting near me. kind of I guess."

11000.0,Patient,"I think I feel protective, then I think, maybe then I won't get hurt if I don't let anyone near me. You know i've had a lot of loss in my life to you know i've been around death ever since I was a little girl. You know, and I, maybe that has something to do with it, you know I lost my dad at a young age, and then I lost my mom and and then my grandma's six weeks to the day, right after that it's crazy um I think that I just don't want to get close to people because i'm afraid to let go maybe."
304.0,Provider,So and and can you prevent them from dying.
11000.0,Patient,Of course not.
304.0,Provider,"You know, oh. it's not going to prevent it from happening right."
11000.0,Patient,Right right.
304.0,Provider,"Right. So it's one thing I think when people say yeah I don't want to let people in because. They might. They might leave me. I mean, I mean. In what you're telling me, like all of that grief your dad your mom your grandma like in such a short time at such a young age, but then not letting people in. You know so that's what I asked what What purpose does it serve you so if the purpose is that maybe you think you can't get you think you can't get hurt."
11000.0,Patient,"I think. You know at least have a purpose might be like. You know I feel like i'm. I feel like, then, if i'm away from it, it won't turn into anything you know it won't turn into anger I don't have to deal with it, you know. i'm not really wanting to ignore things, though I mean I don't push things under the rug and deal with it later i'm wanting to deal with it now let's deal with it now, but i'm."
304.0,Provider,"Well, how can I yeah. You want to deal with things now, but you don't want to deal with the anger."
11000.0,Patient,Right.
304.0,Provider,it's a little bit feelings.
11000.0,Patient,Right yeah.
304.0,Provider,The rug you want you don't want to feel you don't want to feel what feelings are.
11000.0,Patient,"Your good Lisa you're right i'm pretty much. that's why I used to started using because I didn't want to feel I didn't I didn't want to think about it or deal with it. emotions are hard to deal with, I think they really are but it's you know it's a part of life, you got to do with it and you got to get through it and I used to always just numb my emotions I guess. yeah."
304.0,Provider,Right.
11000.0,Patient,I deal with it.
304.0,Provider,"So you don't want to feel how you feel you think that if you keep people away from you, you won't have to feel for them or deal with their feelings, but you're still dealing with your feelings. right but let's figure that out and that's going to help you deal with other people's emotions better um and so on the flip side Marianne if this is kind of how keeping people at bay how how it serves you tell me how it hurts you."
11000.0,Patient,um.
304.0,Provider,What ways has this affected you.
11000.0,Patient,"Well yeah I mean my poor fiance he's such a really good he's a really good man and. You know i'm really comfortable with him i've known him since i've been 13 years old, you know i'm just like a part of the family, you know, he was he's been there for ever even knows my ex husband, he was there for the wedding and everything you know we're all friends. I was married 17 years prior. that's done, for now, though um we're still friends, though, and everything. We still talking everything. But um. You know I feel like i'm hurting him around i'm I feel like I take it out on him a lot, which he he really don't deserve it, he doesn't but. he's just."
304.0,Provider,We just sort of flash you lash out and angry ways at him.
11000.0,Patient,yeah a lot. um. And I shouldn't do that and I put it on him and I and. I think I blame him to I don't blame him. But. I don't know.
304.0,Provider,Probably an easy target you're displacing you're drawn to him. For idle he did or didn't do. Your you're able to to feel those that anger and and unleash it on him.
11000.0,Patient,"Right yeah. yeah it for watching us, you know. I mean, I know he'll never leave me he knows everything about everything you know everything you know he's a he's a really good man he'll never leave me but. I get in my mood where I want to leave him like for no reason. I want to be alone like I don't even want to be with anybody like I don't even know why i'm like that, but I even. don't even want him around."
304.0,Provider,These two things I think for you to say he'll never leave me. um it's probably not the healthiest thinking. Right really sets up a really unhealthy power dynamic um he.
11000.0,Patient,was now that I think about it. doesn't sound right.
304.0,Provider,"yeah knowing Joe you're not perfect, like you, are not for, and neither is he. But I think right well he'll never leave me it's like well i'm so perfect in our relationship is so wonderful that he doesn't deserve any better than this."
11000.0,Patient,"Oh, and I think he does so. I I definitely do think he deserves the best of the best like you know I would never let anybody hurt him like if anybody ever heard him in any way I they'd be in trouble like. you're inputting protective over him at the same time. But I do gotta stop taking."
304.0,Provider,things out. yeah stop seeing you're hurting him your behavior um it's hurting you you're saying he deserves the best of the best. Right they're not being your best self right.
11000.0,Patient,"And that's. And that's where I say, then I want to leave like I then i'll just make it easy and give up and just leave you know that's then that's where I crawl into my little corner my little guns corner, you know i'm kind of laid out I guess."
304.0,Provider,Your best self either like that's running so that's the same thing you were doing you were doing drugs and masking your emotions is now you're just then when things get hard you're running away. When it looks like actually. Dealing with your behavior and looking at yourself and saying like I hurt you and i'm sorry. You know and i'm going to change and i'm going to take steps to do things differently so I want you to just recognize the maybe this anger that has built up and that you are afraid of it comes out in ways that might hurt other people or hurt you. and your creative it too. Right you're afraid. To really feel it and feel what's beneath that.
11000.0,Patient,yeah um I just asked her to getting in touch with my feelings and stuff I used to never want to feel Lisa I just you know um.
304.0,Provider,yeah. Like I tell. even talk about this.
11000.0,Patient,write it.
304.0,Provider,"In and I wonder if you were someone who just didn't I don't know when you were a kid or just growing up that like people just sit and talk about their feelings. And some learn it wasn't safe to be upset where it wasn't safe to show emotion, or it wasn't safe to you know, because with the with the sad and the mad comes the good to. Right like you're not even feeling all of your feelings your kind of wanted."
11000.0,Patient,"Right yeah. yeah definitely stuck a little bit um. You know my parents were great parents, I really had a really good childhood, you know, but I grew up a little different than everybody else you know I um. It was a little rough and stuff you know I had one of my older brothers is not a really good person, you know he's a drug dealer and he deals with bad people and stuff. I caught him out of my life, about a year and a half ago um you know he's always out ripping people off, and you know he's just not a good person, and when I was little. I don't know, I was eight years old, and he had rip somebody off and they came to the door and. They put a gun to my face, and they were like where's your brother i'm going to put them in a body bag and I remember like sticking up for my brother, you know because I looked up to my brother, when I was little. hey he's a piece of shit he ran out the back door and left you know left his little sister right there you know and just left. um you know and stuff like that affected me, but my mom always thought I was too little and she would always say you're too little it didn't concern you it doesn't affect you it doesn't affect you and stuff like that, and it did you know. Where how could it not when she says go hide under the bed, you know, like. Affected me, but I think that's why to like. um she um. She always just said that it didn't affect me and it wasn't our business, and you know don't worry about it and stuff, but we would always be the ones to pay for it, you know."
304.0,Provider,was your mom involved in drugs.
11000.0,Patient,"Not at all my mom was a CCD teacher, she was a virgin when she got married um she was with my dad for many, many years um."
304.0,Provider,She just she was very good mom.
11000.0,Patient,"She was a very good mom, but when I was younger I didn't understand why she always stuck up for my brother I didn't understand what she was like you understand when you're older i'll never give up on my kids i'll never. You know."
304.0,Provider,um but I always thought without it there's a difference between that. and letting people come to your House and have the gun held to your eight year olds head.
11000.0,Patient,Right.
304.0,Provider,Right and your brother was held. In your brother was held at the time.
11000.0,Patient,um he's 11 years older than me.
304.0,Provider,"Okay, so he was he was an adult. yeah putting an eight year old and a really unsafe situation, I mean."
11000.0,Patient,yeah and according to. me like.
304.0,Provider,"you're denying me I had nightmares yeah yeah that's her denial. that's how she wants wanted to cope with it. Right and deal with her guilt. she's denying that she put continue to put you in that unsafe situation right the mom. Right put you in the unsafe situation and left you know left to their. Right didn't it didn't change it sounds like this happened, more than once. yeah her to say it's in an effect you. It that's her denial so yeah."
11000.0,Patient,"So, like until I. mean I moved out on. My own. You know she could call the COPs or anything but she didn't um so i've been pretty much on my own i've never went back home, other than to take care of my mom when she got cancer and I filed for divorce. I went back to take care of her. Because that's my job, no matter what that was my job, and then. And then I bought another House you know. But yeah I mean i've been on my own forever forever ever ever."
304.0,Provider,You feel like you don't know.
11000.0,Patient,"Right, I know i'll always be okay, you know what I mean I know i'll always be okay my mom passed away. Excuse me."
304.0,Provider,Do you feel like you processed that. When she passed away.
11000.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I took care of her, I was there till the last minute, I mean i'm very thankful I got that closure. For sure I definitely did yeah. We watch it it's a wonderful life, like a million times. Oh yeah."
304.0,Provider,"you're still struggling with this fear I think of feeling your feelings and this, I think that when things get hard you just want to run away. And and that's hard to Marianne it's hard like what i'm asking you to do to really look at your feelings, it is hard. And to face those people and face yourself, but what you've been doing is hard like you know what I mean like doing drugs to mask your feelings and trying to get me that's hard to so you need to. choose which part right."
11000.0,Patient,"Right and it's like it's not the hard part. Is i'm not saying no, you know the hard part is a feeling my feelings. it's you know i'm pretty strong personality, but yeah when I don't want to feel easy to mask it. But. yeah. Saying it's a relief now once you get through it it's the hard part is getting through it, but you know, once you get through it it's it's better you know."
304.0,Provider,"I want you. i'm going to send you some things. That is just kind of like feelings, one on one."
11000.0,Patient,Okay.
304.0,Provider,"So when I get home probably like sometime this weekend i'm going to send you some worksheets but um. yeah mindfulness. We try to get like a few minutes of just quiet i'm not doing anything that you know if you start to think about things push that aside, like a cloud. it's like it's just a cloud it let it just dressed. Okay, maybe on those guided meditations, but if you could just do that for like five minutes a day Marianne it's really going to help get some real practice to just settle down. stop asking stop putting up this facade of who you want me to think you are. Because it's not working, sometimes they're working but but a big part of this is not serving you well and it's keeping the people that you love at arm's length, including. You know he's. He needs to learn how to have emotions he needs to learn that it's safe to feel all of his feelings and. you're right a very little."
11000.0,Patient,Guy needs to know that you that it affects him also yeah.
304.0,Provider,"cuz cuz he reminded me that because that's what. got me. You know, and I know you're not intentionally doing that, but even this this wall, you have up he's, on the other side of it too. Right, because if you're not a whole and healthy person who can feel all of your feelings like you're keeping him out to and you're not helping them learn learning all this stuff so. And I know it's hard I know it's scary, but if you I want you to start with, like the mindfulness just five minutes a day. That way, you can just sit and sort of reflect and it's nothing it's not that some you know inspiration will come to you, but just for you to get used to just sitting and being with yourself in that fight, like forever to you."
11000.0,Patient,mm hmm right.
304.0,Provider,"But, but I want that to be some practice for you and then just going to give you some info yeah on those worksheets about. Like what our feelings like what purpose today, Sir, that they're telling us messages that it's communicating so much to us, and so, if we're before pressing that down constantly you're never really going to know yourself. Right ronnie. You know you used to use drugs to numb that to push it down now you, you want to run away from it, you know I don't want you to get into other. Other bad cycles."
11000.0,Patient,"Right right. And you know it's like I do drop one bad habit and pick up another one, it almost feels like you know um. You know, like I i'm not using but, like all this anger now that's a bad habit, you know it's like I have to control that but."
304.0,Provider,"Well, you. You have to feel it that's you know, been trying to control it and and you're trying to push it down in barrier and it's coming out it's leaking out. In in ways that are destructive and are hurting people and hurting you. So what I want to do is let all of it out feel all of your feelings what is really there beneath the anger is it fear is it shame is it scared. You know what is it what's that feeling beneath the anger and and we're going to like deal with it all that we it's it's come anger is a totally acceptable emotion. except when you're when you're using it as a weapon, you know any emotion, can be used as a weapon to hurt someone else. And it. feels these feelings feel really powerful and big and scary, but when when we let it out like it just it dissipates that power. Right Oh, it does it doesn't have that power over you anymore. it's. Not this secret it's not this way, you have to carry anymore."
11000.0,Patient,"yeah you're right, I am pushing it down, and I do need to let it out, you know. I gotta stop suppressing it. Because eventually it's going to come out. And the longer I hold it down. The bigger the explosion probably is going to be cause and effect. So."
304.0,Provider,"If it's it's a it's a cancer, you know if it's like a cancer that you're holding inside your body and it's not even that it's going to explode but it's just going to kill you. Right up all in. All right, and i'm in this thing where i'm like."
11000.0,Patient,"Trying to be healthy now i'm like trying to eat healthy and I only drink alkaline water because cancers and diseases cannot live in alkaline so i'm I only drink alkaline water I just bought a shower head. That i'm filters everything it's really cool because I guess the chlorine and stuff is really bad for you and all this other stuff so yeah I want to live long as possible, I mean I don't want to live as long as possible."
304.0,Provider,"i'm gonna i'm gonna put a follow up to our conversation I think from last time. And you have. One group have been sick. Right people going into the hospital so have your you don't want to drink tap water, because you don't want to get sick."

304.0,Provider,"yeah one like yeah it's one of the guidelines it's easy like five minutes. Just to five minutes a day and then i'll send you some yeah i'll send you some info and and just kind of we can start keep talking more about. Like just emotions and what they are and how to feel them and then feel them and safe ways and know that it's not gonna it's not as scary as you think it will be. Right, it makes sense."
11000.0,Patient,"That makes complete sense. That and then. you're really good at what you do sweetheart. Steve that you need a raise now I need to go. You got to deal with me, though, you know."
304.0,Provider,"ya know and and not just a Marion that you need to go and like sit in your room and cry and like think about your worst memories and your worst experiences of your life like so no. Because. Because I want you to be safe and like just feel things in safe ways so just notice like if you. You know I don't know just notice how you're feeling this week, I think the meditation will really help that that if you start to want to snap at your fiance like try to just take a few deep breaths before you speak and ask yourself what they really upset about. yeah and just sort of tell him tell him that or tell tell yourself that like oh what i'm really upset about is."
11000.0,Patient,yeah that I do. I mean I I let him know for sure. What i'm upset about. And you know. I make you know just because i'm in a mood I make a little nothing into something bigger and it's nothing you know it's life is too short to. Be your time yeah.
