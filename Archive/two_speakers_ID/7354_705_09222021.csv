7354.0,Patient,yeah I should be all right.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and you have family members that can take you when you need to go places or other."
7354.0,Patient,"My son. My son. This home, he has a bad back, but he takes me when when he can, if not, then my husband goes to work for half a day and then comes home or if he tells them he can't go in and he takes me. But that's going to change soon, because i've gotten i'm hoping i'll be able to get on a care provider and medicare for it yeah care providers my grandson he'll be able to take me to appointments help me go to the store get my prescriptions rethinks for me. When I take my. insulin I have a pen and the letters are small and the numbers are small, so I asked my well my youngest granddaughter because she needs to. Learn her numbers and stuff and I asked her well is this on 28 and she'll tell me if it is or isn't it and then she'll tell me, you need a little bit more and i'll move it and she'll tell me okay right there. Okay, so the little ones are helping me a lot."
705.0,Provider,"Well, and that's good and that's makes them feel to even more so, part of the family and then they're they're doing something you know but it's going to be connection to."
7354.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
705.0,Provider,Well that's that's good i'm glad that you're getting the support that you deserves Jesse.
7354.0,Patient,"As i'm well it only lasts for a little while but i'm going to take as much as I can. Right and. My husband still depends on me quite a lot, but like I tell him I told him today go there, something I can do and there's something you can do for me, we can. You know, when I help you, you can help me."
705.0,Provider,So that's a good partnership.
7354.0,Patient,"that's what we're trying to do. But even yet. it's still i'm trying to get him to understand that it takes two people. If we stay in the room, he needs to pick up his stuff so it doesn't make it harder on me. mm hmm because I do mostly everything in the room. So."
705.0,Provider,"And when when that happens, day after day, then it gets where you start to build up resentments and the resentments come out as anger and then it starts this whole cycle."
7354.0,Patient,"Oh yeah it's just like when I got fixed that week he called me and I told him I did the room I wash the clothes now, what do you want me to do and I was yelling at him. And he just said, like whoa. Okay, and he kind of backed off. And it was like I just I don't know I just feel like. I feel like a kid because he's always trying to tell me what to do not i'm a grown up, I mean i'm over 21 i'm 58 years old. And I know what has to be done, but sometimes I just can't do it. And i'm trying to get him to understand that. But it seems like it doesn't work. So, like, I have to take care of everything."
705.0,Provider,Jesse.
7354.0,Patient,"i've been taking care of my husband ever since I met him. When he he came from a very poor family. and I guess is that showed him how to drink he showed him how to work. But he got to the point, sometimes where he didn't want to work and my father. My father brought us up as girls, but he brought us up as boys too. Because he told us that. We were. The head of our families if we got married or if we have children, who are all of our families. And he told us that we couldn't always count on the man to provide and take care of us so almost all his life until we went to I want to say Morgan hill he started working constantly, but I would pick up the slack. I would get a job. When I was working I had worked for atari. The game, the game. The game Council. He was making the cabinets and they laid him off and it got one point where he just did one to nothing he didn't even shave he didn't cut his hair. didn't want to change its close he just. And I kept telling you in that's when I had my oldest son and I kept telling him I can't do this by myself, you need to do something and then. That was the first time, he went to prison. He went to prison for three and a half years he. He had strong arm robbery. He had taken the gun away from the police officer. And they had. I think my brother in law, he had my brother in law, so he tried to get my brother in law away from him and the officer pulled his gun and my husband took it away from him and took it and that's why they charged him with strong armed robbery and plus it was police officer so. He got three and a half years that was three a half years of my life because I had to be both mother and father to my two boys. And right now we're having a problem with my. Second oldest boy, because the stills that his dad doesn't want him around nobody wants to be around nobody loves him, nobody cares for him. But. He has to understand that when he was born. My husband was in prison. So he didn't have that time to bond with my husband."
705.0,Provider,Right.
7354.0,Patient,"And when that happened it didn't bring them closer, I think it kind of drew them farther apart. From now they don't know how to. communicate with each other. or talk to each other, my husband loves him but. I think he thinks he doesn't have anything in common with him. So it hurts my son. But then he takes it out on me, because he doesn't he told me when my granddaughter was born, you told me that he didn't want to talk to anyone that he needed to show his face and that he didn't want me to call. I haven't seen my granddaughter she's. gonna be two months, my grandkids everything."
705.0,Provider,I know that Jesse.
7354.0,Patient,"The only way I get to. see her. picture. When I call. I do, video chat. And that's, the only way I get to. see her. Yesterday I was really hurt. The. i'm going to call her the baby. mama she. posted a message one of her relatives posted a message saying that she wanted to hold the baby and she said don't worry we'll be down there in December. My. oldest granddaughter is. And they keep telling me don't worry you got a baby coming don't worry that's not it. that's not it. it's my son's daughter. I just want to lovers, which is good but i'd like to be get to. number. So we get pictures my husband wants to show his family. But. He can't save it. cuz she she won't let him she does somebody for a favor. And we get saved them either. and"
705.0,Provider,"All I know Jesse that you love all your grandchildren and this little girl is no different, and you know i'm hoping that the parents will start to realize that. This maybe they're they're filling send everything is separated from this child and the bonding with his grandparents and it's other family members that they may real life."
7354.0,Patient,"I think my son is selfish. Because he thinks he's the only one that has problems. He doesn't understand that I have problems too. and I still didn't see only time that they call. When they need money. And when he tells your mom I need $50 can you send it to me, we tried to send more than $50 because we know he needs help. He doesn't take that into consideration, he doesn't take anything. I always tell my husband everybody sees bad nobody ever sees good. i've done a lot of good things for him, you just remember that. And i've also done bad things. he's told me i'm not a very good mom did I wasn't good to him, did I treated him wrong. Maybe I did in some way, but he has to understand that I was only 19 years old. And I I didn't know how to be a mother, I mean I kind of do because I have my oldest one at 16. and And it just makes me feel bad my daughter to talk to me."
705.0,Provider,just see if you are 19 and had two kids and your first ones that 16. you're still trying to figure things out for yourself plus you have two children. You are doing the best that you could.
7354.0,Patient,"I have a hard time. To when my husband went to prison. I would stay with my mother in law. First, I was staying with my dad and my dad kicked me out. And then I will stay with my mother. Did. She had made a statement that. I couldn't get welfare, I was trying to get unemployment. They gave me a little bit of unemployment, but then they stopped. She told my brother. that she knew I had money. In that. She didn't see why couldn't take care of my kids. And I heard her and I told her you know what it's okay i'll take care of them. No, I don't have money but it's all right. I had to call my dad one time. pad for my period. If that was so embarrassing. That was for Thursday that every time. I would do some tissue and tell my husband. It got to the point where I would get on the bus me and my boys and we wrote, all the way to the end and all the way back there was lots of time for the call trends. My God."
705.0,Provider,That was a hard time for you Jesse and you know through through that you raise those boys you raise your daughter.
7354.0,Patient,I just had my voice.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7354.0,Patient,"So we would leave that. One o'clock two o'clock in the afternoon and we wouldn't go home until like 10 o'clock. And we were we live down in downtown San away. And she would tell him she leaves so early unless she doesn't come back until late at night and I kept telling the world what does she want she doesn't want to help us, but yet she wants us to be here. I can't do that I can't do that. started the whole problem with."
705.0,Provider,"Jesse you're always going in that time you still really resourceful and by taking them on the bus it gave you an outlet, and you did that."
7354.0,Patient,"Just survive. them. He when we first got together. He hit me. He gave me a black guy and the first time. my brother in law's have to get them off me. and Then. This mom came in my mother and she. gave me. Some iced put on my eye because she knew that. If. For some reason, when I get in trouble, or I get nervous sometimes. i'll try to make people laugh. I laughed and I told them, you know why don't you get a razor and just you know, put the eye opener so I can see. We go I feel like rocky right now. Then we looked at him, he told me shut up or when I hit you again. And then told him oh go ahead, what more damage can you do. But he didn't. he's like a time. He almost every to the hospital because he gave me a bruise from here to here. Was big, and so what. I like to my mom and my dad. They asked me what happened in the. garden in the fight in the parking lot at work. So my mom I guess she thought she was helping me she called my job and told him. And they pulled me into the office and they asked me about it and I kept light light and I know my boss, nor was. and That stopped that. Everybody would look at me cuz I told I told him. Why should I hide it it's there, and if I hide it it's going to be more visible than what it is now. So I didn't wear. Some people wear sunglasses one girl. On girl was wearing sunglasses. And I knew right away what happened. But I figured if. I shouldn't wear anything and somebody asked me what happened is hold on just gotten to a fight which wasn't alive. and They just told me, I was a liar and that my husband had hit me. That was it and then one time he hit me again. And someone I think his grandma because the houses everybody was related. I think, is where Am I called to police. And they went to the House and. They told my husband that they wanted to see me, but he told me that they couldn't because I was in the bathroom and I kept insisting, and he kept telling them no, you know no then they finally went away. That was clear, hoping that they will see. That would have been my way out. But they did. So I had to make myself tough so every time he tried I would stand up. In front of them, and I would tell him come on off fight till I go down. The list that we need cigna need walk away. well. One time I called him. An sob. And that's when he got the bird. So we were at my my house and we're here and I had a big ol Redwood studied in my yard. And I had a patent my hand. He came around the corner and I hit the tree with the baton and broken half and I told her come up but go one of us as we could get up and I know i'm going to be standing here you're going to be underground and he just looked at me a walk with a friend."
705.0,Provider,you've had enough. And those years and years of abuse Jesse all came from all.
7354.0,Patient,"That wasn't the first time I did. I did this to my dad when I first had my oldest what I pulled the base. That, if he told me i'm taking them away, they said no you're not given to me anyone, he told my sister go to the room and lock the door. She went through she took my baby. what's the kitchen, I told him given to me it goes way you're going to stop me ago, yes, I have no choice and he looked at me he goes I call it is an email to my sister. All of us, please. So I dropped in line. With. What. They got there they told me. it's a good thing, we did see you with the knife in your head, because we put a rescue. And he told me that if I wanted to leave where to live by myself, but the baby wasn't going anywhere stay at the House. So I have no choice because my husband and he came and he talked to me. calmed me down. And I had no choice but to stay in my dad's house, because we have my little boy. And he was helpful for me, though. So I couldn't take it anymore, and I moved to my sister. My whole life so. I don't. I will be remembered that I don't remember very many, but they."
705.0,Provider,Have you ever had a chance Jesse to share this with your son. The one that feels like he was treated and to help them realize.
7354.0,Patient,He used to see it when he was little.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7354.0,Patient,"So we're driving in the car one time. And I said something. To me. Later into my face. If we were in the car, where there was people around it, I don't understand right nobody said anything, nobody called please ready to buy those please, please. I was crying. My oldest son, the first thing the most. teacher is the mobile. space. to pray the Lord. So will. make better apartment. And he got drunk. I always told my son. When that happens, you go in your room. You and your brother. Put your better because the door and don't come out whatever you hear don't come out. And they will do that."
705.0,Provider,Right Jesse even to that you are still keeping your children safe.
7354.0,Patient,"so hard. To. understand that. I love these kids were they loved her father. heard me. Say that remember. Somebody telling me. it's a circle. The keeps going to repeat itself, as somebody has to break it."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7354.0,Patient,In order for the cycle to stop. I don't see anybody.
705.0,Provider,"At this point, Jesse. Did the abuse has the new star. For you."
7354.0,Patient,"yeah. touch me because. i'll stand up to him. I stand up to all my boys even my youngest one news to. 15 to me, and I use my medals when I used to tell him come on let's go well here to you hear me call the police this okay cuz they need a vacation if you just look at you like you're crazy. So no it's true I don't care what and I stand up in this space. Because they had to. myself. I have to show people that i'm not scared of them. Because if I let them know i'm scared. they're gonna get the best of me. i'm I can't do that I can't let anybody do that to me."
705.0,Provider,"And those Defense mechanisms, you know that you development time we're all survival skills and now that you're breaking that that cycle to me Jesse when you're saying that now that that doesn't happen and that you stood up and that people then are not laying their hands on. Part of breaking that cycle. and your kids, even though they witness it as children kids form their own perception will happen. And so, in a child, where. As an adult. Out of the heat of battle dress if you have an opportunity to talk to each of your children. about that, because as an adult they're they're looking at it from a child's view still and you've been able to give you know. Your recollection of what happened, what your intent was could be healing."
7354.0,Patient,"I don't know these these kids are stubborn. mm hmm they're very stubborn or. Is it just like my daughter. I asked her well why is it your brother talking to me, and she started giving me a list and I told him wait a minute wait a minute. You don't know what's going on. Is the word I go before you were born. Good dad went to prison for three years I was pregnant with your brother when he went. and told her he was born when your dad was there, and the only time he got to see your dad was on the weekend. Because I try my hardest to get them over there. And I told her there's a bond between children and their dad, just like the mom. The palm bonds with the baby the dad has to bond with the baby so that there's this bond. That they still say that they could trust that. it's all your brother didn't have that with your dad. your brother was born without your dad all we had was a bunch of women, which we all called a moms and they only had one man, and that was my dad, but they were mostly with the women in that match, so they say that they were brought up by five women. I told him this they didn't have he didn't have that bond with him so that's why he's the way he is your dad don't know how to act with them, he don't know how to act with your dad. and She stopped talking. And she never she hasn't called refer."
705.0,Provider,"To it has where you've been put out there some history and you've given them, you know of the truth and then now it's up to each of the adult children because they're adults now. And you know, for them to be able to take responsibility for their behavior now because. If you keep I mean, and I know you've even shared this in group is, if you keep blaming it on the childhood and things have to happen at some point, you have to take responsibility of what you can do now and for your actions."
7354.0,Patient,"Well he's told me I did a lot of things wrong to him. A very poor job I told him that ever done anything wrong to you I from the bottom of my heart i'm sorry that's, all I can do now, I can't fix it. Right people back and fix it I would but I can't fix it no, I can say is i'm sorry."
705.0,Provider,"Right, so you did everything within your power Jesse to start the healing process for your son now it's in his court. Of what is he going to do with it, if he's going to harbor resentments and just feed off of that and blame others or if he's going to take more of a look at himself to see what he's responsible for. Any might not be there yet."
7354.0,Patient,If too busy. Living his problems for him up. i've always told my kids instead of making problems make solution.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7354.0,Patient,"If you make solution it's better, but if you sit here and make more problems for yourself it's going to be worse. So it's like. I don't know just like give me a break, no. I don't know, nobody hit me I don't let nobody. I don't back down I don't back down I can't back down. don't think i'm weak if I back down. I might cry when I say that they say. But I will. i've noticed that i've gotten more. There was this one time it was thanksgiving and I was at work, and I was getting ready to come home, and I was texting my husband and I was walking. And some lady came and she was walking and back and back of Michigan get the freak out of my way. I said, excuse me. Just to get the freak out of my way I go Okay, who the heck are you talking to people like that, and then she says, you know, and I looked at her, she kept running she got in her car she backed out, and I said yeah that's right just run. Is she having point. And I was going to hit her. I was going to hit it. i've always told my kids when people use words like that it's just word it's just worth it don't hurt, but it does hurt."
705.0,Provider,"And all those years of abuse Jesse came back to you, where that instinct to fight as much as you could. comes back and that's where you were seeing to that you cry when you recall it. To me just have all those years that you had to suppress it. And just carry on and put up a mask for your children that it makes sense that you would now release the tears that you didn't get to release. And to fill that of what it was like and i'm glad to see that you realize, you were young and you were doing the best that you could with the situation given to you. And it was you know with the abuse, no one deserves to abuse and you endured that for many years, which now you know to me that parking lot incident explains, you know you took where you were coming from I could see where that fight or flight to took over."
7354.0,Patient,This fight.
705.0,Provider,"Because that's what you've been doing all your life is you had to you were forced to take care of your kids and everything else, where that comes automatic and in that moment you're like wait a minute."
7354.0,Patient,"There was times, where I wanted to give. them up, I called social this. I called welfare one time. my sister heard me and I asked him what I had to do to give up two children. two boys. They told me that I had to bring them down to to the office and leave them there with them and they were take care of. my sister her me and she started hitting me she started punching me and she told me what the hell, are you doing your kids."
705.0,Provider,you're desperate.
7354.0,Patient,"I told her i'm tired i'm tired. i'm tired I just I was young, I wanted to become myself, I see all these kids going all over the place, and here I am stuck at home with two kids. I wanted to do what they did. instead. It gets stuck I don't regret having them I just kind of wished, I would have had him when I was older. Because. I didn't need my dad and my mother in law, treating me bad. For my dad always treatment me bad when my mom left. Your always treated me that I had to take care of people, but she loved my dad told me. That I was the lady of the House. If he had to go he had to go to a funeral and he told my sisters, you have to stay here i'm taking Jesse she has to replace your mom. So I had to get dressed up and go to a funeral to somebody I didn't even know. He told me you're representing our family. So, after a."
705.0,Provider,lot of pressure and responsibility for a kid.
7354.0,Patient,Only 14.
705.0,Provider,"Not Jesse you went right into a marriage, that was very similar with your father and the way that he was treating you and it just the pattern continued until you took that step, and you said no more."
7354.0,Patient,"it's funny cuz. I was. beaten up almost every day. I was called the horse. was told I was just like my mom. He got to the point where, if I had a nice blouse or shirt on I had to change it when they got home because they knew my dad was coming and he was going to start slapping me you're calling me names. and Nobody knew that. Nobody knew that. When I went to high school I don't even speak the teachers cared just as long as I showed up I got worse than high school. Every day."
705.0,Provider,"How was your outlet in your coping of how to deal with that Jesse as a kid you don't know anyway else you know and for you, putting on that mascot school that everything was Okay, but it wasn't i'm not surprised that drinking and you know that became a habit for you. was an easy you know coping of a way to just disengage not think about it, have you ever Jesse been to any type of therapy or groups for like domestic violence survivors groups."
7354.0,Patient,"No, I. tell you the truth, and i'm going to tell you the truth, the honest truth. and i'm glad you're helping me in there. But. I trust you that's why i'm telling you all this. I don't trust her many people. I know. that the group doesn't know very much about me. Because I was taught by problem problems were private."
705.0,Provider,Right hey I grew up in that family a Jesse where. The family secrets. it's. When you.
7354.0,Patient,Talk to when I sat down always sit with my back towards the wall.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7354.0,Patient,"I never worked I didn't wear dresses. In high school. Since my dad told me, you always got to be prepared in case somebody jumps. I mean wants to fight. And I stopped wearing makeup they stopped combing my hair. I just wish somebody would have figured it out, for all that happened. Now, nowadays, people are quick quick to jump to that phone call 911 and say this is what happens, this is what's going on and sometimes it's not even happening. Come back then they didn't care. They didn't care. They look at you, and you that I would have liked, so I got into a fight so cool. That."
705.0,Provider,sense of feeling helpless to in that situation Jesse is wearing through the years.
7354.0,Patient,"And then I call myself a bad kid because I would drink in the parking lot. I would skip school. I was smoking cigarettes, but then you could smoke, because they had special places for you to smoke. I would go hang out at the store across the street with a bunch of girls. And then. I met my husband. And I stopped Okay, since I have to clean house and have to take care of two girls i'm an adult I wasn't I was still a kid and I told myself well if i'm an adult i'm going to act like one. So I would leave. At 12 o'clock in the afternoon. And I wouldn't come home until about four or five in the morning. My dad would hear me i'd be drunk and he saw me, I want to talk to you in the morning, I want to talk to you tomorrow, when I get off work, and I say oh yeah yeah and I go to bed. And wake up by 11 o'clock. It comes to whatever I had to wait for my right and leave again right before you got home. So it got to the point where i've seen out all day and all night. Because I didn't want to be there. And then, when I got home, I was all trump. But. It was kind of my fault, because I could control it, I could call the police myself. I couldn't ask for help, somebody like me, but also to they couldn't they. couldn't have did what they did."
705.0,Provider,"Your life messy and I want you to remember to just like what you were saying is in those times, it was different than even if you would have gone and got the hill. It was more than likely that they wouldn't have done something about it, so you did like I know how it is that you feel like gosh I wish I could have done this, and I wish it would have happened sooner. Given the circumstances, and what you were going through you, you each day just was trying to survive and when alcohol was there, it was used to escape. You thinking that you were you know hey i'm an adult i'm going to go for it and getting into a marriage, that also had the abuse part probably felt like what you were used to you were raised in that atmosphere it's not what you wanted, but it's what you know felt probably. Somewhat normal for you, because you wouldn't know really anything different."
7354.0,Patient,Oh. One time where my dad really gave it to me my mom went to slap me and I grabbed her her hand and I told her you know you can't do that.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7354.0,Patient,"My dad came right back for punched right in the face, and I was bleeding all over the place. To be toby don't come back, I tried it I tried by the video stay with that they could fight no bloody. So I went back home. I was crying crying and my dad gave me and my sister's room and he told me why you cry I go cuz I don't want you to punch me in the face of yet. They just looked at me a walked away. My dad was i'm sorry, excuse me, but what i'm going to say my dad was a real asshole. He was. The only person ever remember maybe because they can't remember cuz my mom left when I was 14 where she did just a couple of times, but I remember everything she said."
705.0,Provider,From what you told me Jesse and I appreciate that you're open and honest with me is yeah it sounds like to me that that was more than an asshole but things that you did not deserve. The love and the security that you didn't get from your father figure that you looked up. He was impaired and wasn't able to give you any of that.
7354.0,Patient,"One time wait. my sister she married an abusive person too. And my niece. called me one day she was small she was like about one say nine or 10. She called me on the phone and she says. jj go work because that's what they call me. My Daddy city my mama and he will we were alone. I said okay just go to Room tell your mom and daughter room and lay down and go to sleep. People know. Okay. She called me again, and she was screaming jj you won't stop hitting her. I said okay i'll be right there. And that's when I worked at night. So I gotta. put my clothes on. And I hate myself, I put my slippers which I should have never done. And we lifted Morgan hill we lived. In an orchard, so we always kept it that by the door in case something happened. So I grabbed the BAT. going out and they told us i'll be back. This is where you're going and going to go to my sister's house, because what are you doing with that I go don't worry about it in my circuit say mom let me go with your said no, no one, nobody. I got to the House and knocked on the door. And I got the BAT like I was good at that. And I waited for her husband to open the door and I swing. But I missed, because I was aiming for its head. And I hit him on the shoulder. We started fighting we started fist fighting. And I slipped and fell. And he started choking me. And I started hearing. Someone had called the police. So the police got up there and they. They they. asked what was going on. He told him that I was trying to kill him which i'm sorry what's true. Because I figured if I get rid of takes care of all the problems, nothing else will happen. But I didn't. He told the officer that I have broke his arm. So they called the paramedic. which was kind of funny cuz the paramedics came to me first before they went to him and asked me if I was already. told me that my heartbeat with regularly that I needed to go to the hospital I said no, no hospitable they told to us what. They say I heard him, then you can take me because, in my head, it was like if they take me it takes a while my husband get down there. By the time I get there, they put up fail, he could put up fail. I got lucky because somehow that that disappeared. because that was the only thing stopping them from taking me was the BAT. And then officer came by and he told me. His arms okay. It takes two pounds of pressure to break something. And lifted and I said oh. And I shouldn't have said it, I said oh I wasn't aiming for his heart arm, I was aiming for his head. And he just looked at me like what. My dad showed up. And I told you before my dashboard I told the officer to hold on well I call someone to come and pick up my car because they need it. And i'll go with you. He said Okay, so I wouldn't call my husband. My husband tells me what the hell, did you do. And I told him. He got upset he said okay. And then my dad showed up and then the offer said i'm not going to rescue there's nothing wrong. we're going to take him away. I said okay. Then I called my husband. and I told him don't bother of your home. And I went home. and the next day or so sore. my sister is bigger than me. she's heavier than I am, and I keep telling myself word cushy take care of herself. But no Jesse to the rescue."
705.0,Provider,"For for your family for many years. And with a messy you know i'm glad that. You are starting to Hill and this has been many years and so part of this just is I want you to remember that you've been through a lot and then. When things come up to be able to work, work through it by if you need to do some deep breathing and things like that, when you're not you know here and we're talking. Is what I what sometimes can happen Jesse as people become overloaded and where you know, like now, I know that we're going to have to end in a minute and so. What are some things that you can do where then you're able to okay I don't want you to stuff things, but I want it to be more of a balance, does that make sense. Where it's like we can continue to work and, if ever Jesse there's a time. That you want more of like support groups for domestic violence and things like that, as a survivor let me know it is you know other options for you to explore."

Because you've been giving giving giving and that's what your program to do but it's like wait a minute, you need the support to and so you're here use your voice and do share absolutely Jesse. i'm glad that you're there, and this next week, if maybe just you know again to really start this healing process is just tell. You know that that self talk we've been speaking about and discussing and group is really starting to replace it, where you give yourself the understanding and kindness that other people didn't give to you. So that that self love and compassion, if something happens today, and you, maybe don't do things, how you want to do it, or maybe you need a nap or whatever it may be it's just. For today i'm taking care of me for today i'm going to love myself and just really start to ground yourself back Jesse and do any of the deep breathing or anything that just can help you relax when something comes up.
