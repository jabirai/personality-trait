Like I enjoyed that no wonder, the Marty, I guess, so yesterday and i'm making my mom's call with her helping me, you know but we're butting heads again in the kitchen, of course, you know cuz she likes to make it our own ways. For her it's easy you know, Chris you making things here, making this dish for like 30 years. yeah so a little little trickier you know because I don't want to, for me, I was nervous because I don't want to get a sick today, so you know it is it's it's it takes about two hours to me correct me two hours to me."

16610.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah yeah that that's the that's the part that the hard part is the way she likes to make it her way. And, but. We made it and make it is first off, I want to make the shadow on how to make this you know I know it's a process I don't know how to make to the know but that's the same way, I felt a few years ago, when I first started making tacos. Now I know how to make them easily when I first started making them, I was like overwhelming myself how am I how am I gonna make this was she got the frustration out or makers and now it's like it's already a routine. And it's going to help me in the long run. I can feed myself and not depend on fast food all the time, you know. yeah once a year."
760.0,Provider,"it's healthier to eat, something that was prepared in your own home by your by your hands by mom's hand somebody."
16610.0,Patient,"Can I always eat and I always specifically buy organic chicken organic lettuce and everything again it's cheaper and it's quicker and always making it. And so I was like i'm gonna make this because, like when my manager told me as it should, I should I gonna be around forever, you know she is seven years old, so. he's doing she wants and then at first, I was like i'm gonna hit this ship from her you know, and then I kind of sat with her, you know, whenever he talks down to me because she is old it's like I said earlier, but then I was like you know what. I should learn how to make this because one it'll help me be more independent and I can make, can I love, making it, you know, especially on a cold winter day the best maybe not so much, not a little warm here in La. But it's the best. Okay that's another that because all I know how to make scrambled eggs and tacos you know, whatever i'm limited. But later on, I couldn't keep making it with her helping me and then I can be really good, making it and that's an other dish I can make. And then later on when I do decide to finally the enjoying the rest of the society and dating somebody because everybody nobody in three almost three years, which is pretty damn pathetic, but it is what it is. that's appealing to women, you know and that's like oh it's a cook something oh wow that's great now it's like you know what I should you know so i'm like okay i'll made it for her yesterday. Or maybe yesterday it was it was pretty good, but only because she kind of took her hand in a little me helping me along the way."

So the gallstones when I will eat certain foods like beef or steak. or anything we say French Fries I couldn't eat French Fries. It would cause me tremendous amount of pain. So the surgeon in the emergency room the surgeon in the hospital when I send it for free days, he told me, this is a March last year, he told me I don't believe. you're losing weight, because of the gallbladder gallstones I am my opinion I believe it's because you're anorexic can you have anorexia.

And I just felt so crappy because here I am suffering and pain, I came to have it removed. The surgeon there told me he didn't believe in my heat, he told me that he thought I was anorexic because I was, I was 24 hours super duper thing. That you can see my bones on my entire body. wow terrible terrible I looked.

As a woman, going to be okay with me not drinking not smoking waking up early going to sleep early because I want to do a midnight and i'm going to give a midnight and long time minutes early for me it's pretty damn are in the clay, they would have been at five in the morning. Right, the last. 12 years. And I would only wake up early in the morning half asleep to go to like the moment take a moment and talk to the moment. something important for some job my job, maybe you go wake up early, but other than that I was laid back and then i'll go back to my regular. Work in about one in the afternoon, you know, but now you say I feel good you know i'm out there, getting some cloud so pale pale because I wake up in the sun's gone."
760.0,Provider,"I think there's a whole lot of. People in general, including women eddie that you know, especially as we get older like focusing on somebody who is you know, taking proper care of self. Because you know going, you know getting proper rest getting up at a proper time all of those kinds of self care things working or and or education eating right sleeping right exercise, you know which I know those things are important to you. And I think. there's going to be women out there that are. focused on caring for themselves. And you know. Being with somebody who is using or abusing substances, you know I don't I just think you got a better chance of having a more positive relationship with somebody who's more focused on. themselves and self care and family and. You know healing. kind of things even even people in recovery. or people through the you mentioned that a couple weeks ago the Catholic Church even religious. You know, finding a way to bond around self care and healing and would be. Just i'm just gonna throwing that out there for you to kind of."
16610.0,Patient,"guide and I guess, I still have this back and forth. With my mind of like am I going to be so that's my life. Am I going to be just never drink a beer again never smoke in is that gonna be my life and i'm gonna let him I have yet to accept it, I guess i'm trying to say. I I should have said it already. But I still have that peace of mind of like. Maybe Oh, maybe when I think about like maybe you know cuz it's gonna be forever and people are gonna be hanging out again barbecues and so am I just gonna be like that boring guy who doesn't drink and smoke, I mean."
760.0,Provider,To be boring.
16610.0,Patient,"Some people think that but I guess that's what I think people who don't drink or smoke, do you guys want you know, and I guess that's what I think about people who don't drink or smoke, they will always be like I consider them like a point boring person can do anything you know. cuz I would I would drink, you know, and I did a lot of heavy truck you know, like a lot of trouble, like a lot of people at 9000 you know my teens and 20s I did a lot of experimenting and drug is tough. But um."
760.0,Provider,"You know, different stages in our life and there's a lot of people. lots of people who have done a tremendous amount of work on themselves that had a substance abuse problem and can't drink or smoke either either either that or they're going to go back down that rabbit hole addiction and you know and. they're. they're not boring."
16610.0,Patient,"I guess I had this, I guess, I had to start to the reasoning class I tell a friend of mine who we sang it all the time we used to go out to bars and clubs. We say in our friends house, we should drink beer, and I mean to while you know, we should go out, you know look for quality bars and just you know be smuggle you know.

Now they've been hanging out every you know, once a month and they go out to bars early and we're at a bar in pasadena whatever were other drinking there with them with chicks out there and oh my yeah my damn I haven't even. been out to a. Nothing I never mentioned, you know some weird is. I don't I don't even know why well I have nowhere to go either, but I don't really leave my house and at night. I haven't gone anywhere in the nighttime. And like almost since 2019."
760.0,Provider,is actually something to. Do with driving in the car in the dark. Is that.
16610.0,Patient,"it's because well one I have nowhere to go dependent or the pandemic. I had gotten sick. And lost all that we. don't have a car. And then I don't really have anywhere to go. Rather than come down and then that gave me gave up on inviting me Oh, you know cuz I don't know i'm not gonna go, you know. And then. I told I told my other friend he called me yesterday, and I was oh man, if I wasn't if I was alone by myself. i'd probably be out there more i'd probably be less worry less concerned about anything, because it was just me, I mean they're chasing. You know they're mingling with the women. You know, but."
760.0,Provider,you're you're concerned because. You don't want to. You probably if you've been doing that you probably would have breakfast at home by.

760.0,Provider,That they take the care in the hospital I think they try to separate the congregation's from the the.
16610.0,Patient,Other patients they're.
760.0,Provider,"There for different reasons, so they take different care going into a bar. yeah she's lucky when she's lucky, it is that she has a. Who. cares about those things, because this is. You know meeting with other people through zoom and just just in my life in general there's lots people out there that. i'm just gonna live my life and they don't think about those things they don't care about those things, and they take the risk. And they brought it home, I mean i've seen it time and time and time and time again, so you know you're doing a good job because you're you're making a really hard choice."
16610.0,Patient,"My I can to. Part of the reason i'm not working well party meeting is because I am going to have to work but i'm like i'm gonna i'm gonna do my mom being the way she has. How am I going to do that's always in the back of our mind to how am I going to day and kiss and dating. And then I have this my mother, you know, like the way her statuses and maximum. But yeah you know, like everybody I know has gotten it twice right. yeah and they're both I see them they're like a zebra, we can only do. and a friend when. He asked his two sisters to it."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16610.0,Patient,"They were overweight. They were about the same age as me. But. That was the reason I got into it, because I heard that story, you told me like game over the next day, when I got back to me. Because I wasn't gonna get back, and I was, I was one of the people I didn't believe it now I don't want to give I don't trust it. Yes, I wasn't to get back in here, but I wanted it to be out more. More testing more you no longer. In that story that story, he has he told me and I had no idea, he passed away one was in a coma for a month and then she passed away alone in the hospital, the other one was sick. died in the hospital and I was like whoa that that's all I took for me to go get the vaccine like I didn't I don't regret it."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16610.0,Patient,"I think it both in March, but i'm still 5050 I want to get it, I don't know."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16610.0,Patient,"But yeah all these things that I think about work, so I have zero social life."
760.0,Provider,We had talked about the possibility of living somewhere else that's another option so.
16610.0,Patient,yeah I know I thought about that my sister ended up getting our own inner game to play.
760.0,Provider,So there's nobody to move in with mom.
16610.0,Patient,"yeah and then my mom. She hates my brother in law and I kind of do too we all have a reason why. he's a really great person. My mom doesn't really get along with my. Mother God bless her difficult person right she doesn't really like my brother's baby mother, even though I think she's great nobody's perfect right. But he is a total he isn't you have to accept that she is the mother of your grandchild you know she is a mother."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, but she doesn't like your your sisters. Significant other and your. dad. your brother significant other."
16610.0,Patient,"He he she doesn't think her daughter in law for her brother or no. sentiment son and daughter in law and then both. But then, in my brother's house. They she lives they bought a house next to her family and 20 minutes or 20 minutes here. what's not too far, but her family lives nearby and then always popping in at her house. house and I don't think they really were mascara protected, he is kind of come in and whatever you know."
760.0,Provider,A lot of people that are kind of careless that way.
16610.0,Patient,"yeah they're just coming in and now like whatever you know not talking about a year, because we know the baby, you know the babies and get it on to you know that's part of the reason we didn't go cuz I was living. In the House Oh, the only place that she's gonna be happy is."
760.0,Provider,He where you're at.
16610.0,Patient,You know I picture was having I was picture as a Gemini living in a bigger moving in this House into my own home. A bigger home.
760.0,Provider,To great and.
16610.0,Patient,"we're still going to be under the same roof. and You know, it sounds we are turning off, I mean everyone I talked to when online. intentions are meeting, though."
760.0,Provider,"yeah well there's you there's ways to reduce the risk, though, to eddie I mean. I before I worked with bright heart health because right now there's no risk of coven but I used to work in person. i've actually been vaccinated since January of 20 because I was eligible being in mental health. To give vaccine I got it right away because it gave me peace of mind, but I know that because I was responsible, with the mask and I personally never got it, I know I was exposed multiple times to with different coworkers and also different patients, I had worked with. So I think there's something to. Perhaps, maybe. giving out there, but just reducing the risk because you know you can't continue to live in a bubble and and Kobe you know they keep talking on the news how covert is not going to go away we're going to have to learn to live with it. And I don't because I don't see how I mean I would love to be wrong on that one. You could just have Kovac completely disappear from the entire planet would be huge miraculous thing but i'm not really counting on that so maybe started thinking about ways to reduce your risk, so that you can get out there more. And so that you can live your life because. You know your your mental health is improving your physical health is improving and you're still a young guy you deserve to get out there and live your life work. Be with friends have your romantic involvements and. yeah and all of that."
16610.0,Patient,"I guess my mom. Like. I don't know what she's texting me like I was approached you and she told me like. You know what. You deserve to get back out there and date, you know, like, I think, in her mind she expects me to be alone my whole rest of my life."
760.0,Provider,"Maybe she doesn't is there any do you have you have only one sister and one brother. yeah she doesn't like either of her in. her daughter or her son in law, so do you think it's do you think it will you said, your brother in law, you understand why she didn't like it, but you."
16610.0,Patient,Know she'll never they would never ever shake somebody's passionate.
760.0,Provider,But do you think that if you got involved with somebody do you think she would have issue with that person to.
16610.0,Patient,Core sheen's nobody's ever going over.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so that's."
16610.0,Patient,"What I did if somebody for a nice breeze a hangout Am I right, am I met her a few times for though I don't learn to quiet. was quite you know. Okay, you know she she she was really skinny, no, no, no you're the skinny and why she's so quiet and that's the way she has anyone with that you know if she would talk too much you go Oh, why Thank you so much."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16610.0,Patient,So it's just like nobody's ever anyone of that but i'm like a year and I never told her they ain't nobody's ever going to be good enough for you. But i'm so disappointed because I mean there's metaphorical tug of war of carrying being a good son tank carbon on what i'm doing and i've been doing them doing the thing i'm doing the right thing.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16610.0,Patient,"But I am stuck in this metaphorical tug of war, where i'm not able to have a life I don't have a life, I mean i'm alive. I don't have a. dating life I deserve to find you know I deserve to date somebody."
760.0,Provider,"It is any deserve to be more social in general. yeah it starts with that. So so much. For something start doing some thinking about what are some you know because it's in life eddie I think it's all about balance. Because if you continue to live in that bubble you're going to hit a wall when it comes to your mental health because. we're social people and you're you're highly social person, I can tell from the way that you talk the way we interact you're very social person. Very important to you in your life and so it's going to be important to your mental health that you get out there, so what are some balanced ways that can change mom moms probably not gonna like any any girlfriend that I bring home moms probably never going to want to get the vaccine. So what are some balance. Things that I can do, because you know we've got these two extreme choices we got the extreme choice of living isolated in a bubble. And then we got the extreme choice of being out there and being completely careless what are some ways that you could think about being more in the middle of those two things."
16610.0,Patient,"And that's exactly what i've been struggling with the last several months, you know. After my surgery, I was like whoa I want to recover the surgery, so I can't be nobody, so I use that as an excuse, you know, like oh. I guess, can you really say I can I can be anybody okay it's fine the pandemic i'm gonna hide in my house okay it's fine. i'm a gallbladder removed that hammer surgery and require from there, get high and i'm going to use that as an excuse to know i'm using an excuse, I guess, and I don't I don't know what the median is I don't know because."
760.0,Provider,it's all because of mom that you're afraid that you're not going out or these there's some part of some maybe the trauma of what you went through that keeps you from going out.
16610.0,Patient,"At first it was me first do it because I was embarrassed embarrassed ashamed to show my skinny freakin self to the world. You know, even a mask and we can see my skinny face, but now i'm getting better and i'm like I want to get out there and legal. But I tell you I tell my family to my for anybody my. My biggest concern and I told you before is. If I only want to put it on the you know if I were to go out. bring it back get it and bring it to her. God we're busy on the hamster. I don't know if I can live with that yeah the guilty. I don't want to read the reason. You know i'm saying I don't want to say you know, but you know what i'm trying to say right."
760.0,Provider,Now I know she's saying you don't want to bring it home.
16610.0,Patient,"yeah and then. I wouldn't be with somebody with that the risk my life. I wouldn't. I don't think I can make a Marina being the reason. That would crush me. yeah yeah, no, no question and that's, the reason I friends either like yeah you know you got it. So i'm like stuck you know I don't know what to do, I don't know I can go out but i'm gonna have to be the only person in whatever what a mascot. So i'm like i'm stuck you're stuck you know, like she knows, she knows me any favors not being here."
760.0,Provider,"What about what about alternative location and you said you're used to go into buyers with friends and doing that kind of thing what are some other things that you can do. About outside difference. church, for instance, I know I know you, you talk about your faith is very important to. You What about going to. church with the math."
16610.0,Patient,"that's a good idea I haven't I haven't I haven't gone back years I used to go every Sunday afternoon, but I haven't been back since now I just watched on TV, but I should go back there to socialize with people you know. But then my mom told me like. Be careful you know, and he will make a comment like Oh, when I watch the football game. You know the more risky themselves getting that. damn i'd be other dude I was invited alone or the other."
760.0,Provider,"But here's here's the thing. I don't like I remember when. coven first hit the beginning of 2020 the the chances, the number of people in the population that had posted you know, the chances of running into that person. catching the virus from that person was kind of low. The longer this goes. You know you you you, you know you can walk into walmart you could be masked even. And you could catch it just wouldn't grocery shop."
16610.0,Patient,"yeah and I just went today, I went to the sprouts and I had the CVs."
760.0,Provider,"sprouts and they're they're the risk. You know the longer this goes, this is way, this is the way I i'm just sharing with you a little bit eddie if you kind of bear with me, this is my own. kind of internal justification how i'm living because I like I said I believe in living a life of balance, not not. met with my you know completely isolated i'm never going to go out again, you know hideaway in my house and that the other extreme, of taking all these unnecessary risks so i've been struggling to find that balance and i've come to the to accept that. I think personally that even though i've been exposed I know it's just a matter of time before I catch it. But i've done everything right. i'm i've been vaccinated since the very first chance I got I could i'm actually tripled vaccinated so i've had my boost everything, and I still wear a mask when I go out, I still take precaution, when I go out but i'm trying to find ways to be more balanced like you know and choose. Maybe taking the time where, am I going to be willing to take the risk because you know everything we do in life is risk. I can get in my car, you know, after this appointment and go to the market, and you know, have a car accident. So there's risk to getting in my car there's there's risk to walking my dog down the sidewalk you know somebody you know somebody could you know. Even walking on the sidewalk people can be hit struck by a car, you know there's just there's just risked everything we do so it's a finding the balance but you're not living in this extreme and you're not living in that extreme and choosing your rest. so that you can be satisfied. With the way your life is going so that your mental health your physical health can continue to improve."
16610.0,Patient,"yeah that's what it is and it's because. I was like whenever I think you might have found great you know i'm looking at you know because she was she qualifies to be the person I was like. I get in and I couldn't believe she don't want to get I couldn't believe in oh my God, what did you get your school. check off all these boxes you're right there you know. And then every time I bring it up Tara was like an argument should get paid her arm even go up you know you don't get me upset me again breathing in and then she would get all like yeah episode episode I call it known that don't talk to me."
760.0,Provider,That you can't change that.
16610.0,Patient,"To be 4567 I think i'd ever a time at all, like last month, I was I got saved I can train more than you know the real you know, the risk of you know what happened to my friend scissors you know she know what I mean. yeah that's how I guess all my hope was that she would get vaccinated. And one of action. oof I can find me rejoin society and. be less fearful, but we all know. The people who unfortunately passed away, are the ones that we're not going. anywhere."
760.0,Provider,And she says that's her choice.
16610.0,Patient,"And then, if God forbid, something happens, I have my brother my deserve everything to blame me. How did she get it, she doesn't go nowhere must be you you're the reason she passed away you."
760.0,Provider,yeah you're the one they're doing all the work of caring for her when nobody else is.
16610.0,Patient,"She poured into my brother manager my nephew my great grandmother. And that's what I struggle with strawberries I work specifically struggle with every day. During the range surprised I didn't get it, and she don't go nowhere, how did you get it must be new you know you. And then I think about that i'm like damn you know, like. No. No, why not only would do it that no, you know. And I go I go I taught myself it can't just be only me you can't just be I can't be the only person out there, that are not vaccinated August, the person, you know. And they have a social life. yeah I don't know what the median is the only thing to do is meet outside. restaurant outside part about I. mean."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16610.0,Patient,you're hanging on my friend at the word man all time.
760.0,Provider,"With you have to wear masks I still wear masks I. I do, I don't wear a mask when it when I get into family gathering I don't do that but. I take a walk I wear a mask I pass somebody on the sidewalk i'm wearing a mask probably going to walk my dog when I have a break. And i'm going to wear a mask when I pass somebody."
16610.0,Patient,I pick them up today. I have a.
760.0,Provider,"I do, I do, I do have, I do have those so you know, maybe easing into find some activity that you can get out and get some kind of social you know I suggested church."
16610.0,Patient,"Church is good yeah I gotta get back to though I took I told a lie, when I think I told you this after I went to an argument about are getting authentic because that caused me a tremendous amount of. anxiety and stress as one of my. stressful situations, you know. Is because I became really antisocial I depend, I became really isolated depressed anxious nervous and I couldn't really interact with human beings, which is weird because i'm very. sociable friendly outgoing and I developed like this paranoia of like you know I think people I was so nervous and shaking the first I went to the store because I hadn't gone, almost a year and a half."
760.0,Provider,yeah so strange.
16610.0,Patient,Very strange and then I told him I did our guy just a moment blame oh. How are you gonna do it will take it better i'm gonna get a job and i'm going to plan on dating a girl and then. Having a neutral and.
760.0,Provider,what's her answer.
16610.0,Patient,"You only be just only was, I will you can come near me, you need to come, you have to be in a room like so i'm never going to have you again, and she didn't really give me she's not she's not. Just an option."
760.0,Provider,You can be in your room or you could just be out all the time that. Then that's like a risk.
16610.0,Patient,"There isn't gonna be no more like hey are you because I always hugger when I wake up and I always have them, I want to sleep, you know somebody might think that weird, but I just i'm the only person that nobody else comes and visits really. I mean the only human interactions you have."
760.0,Provider,With your sister and your brother don't come visit your mom.
16610.0,Patient,"my brother would come once a week to bring my grandson my Grad programs on. By really busy right now, he lives. he's working right now, so he that i'm not gonna be there for a few weeks, he but he was coming every week for the last several months, he was born, one for a few hours every Thursday would come, which is great Ramon never really helped us in the room. my sister she works or whatever and weekends and blah blah her excuses that she doesn't want to bring into her. three. Children twice, but she did come on thanksgiving tea and help her make them all this food and then she did come on Christmas Eve, to help me and whatever."
760.0,Provider,"Also there's also frequent there's also testing that can be done, like. No, you know you can choose."
16610.0,Patient,"They don't want to I don't know. If she doesn't want to give you like a mile from here, your excuses terrible can come in and visit anytime she wants she's the one piece you want I think she just she starts by every week to drop off."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16610.0,Patient,"Are you doing well, she calls her, but she calls her every morning and every afternoon every day. And I do give her credit where he does call every day, and you know, bringing us out bring stuff. But she told me, so I don't want to compete with each other, I actually told me i'll tell you that's what I want to come visit, I want to risk, you know cuz she was she work in an office. So I want to bring. An end the only human me, yes, once they leave me alone, I prefer like really old, but she didn't have to because hey I can't just be in my bubble my protective."
760.0,Provider,"metaphorically, maybe, maybe Maybe you can. From time to time without attachment suggest the roxy. And as you're leaving making then she might be willing to get vaccinated just so that. You know, you and your brother and your sister would be more willing to visit with her. Maybe having a you know, having a conversation does your sister and your brother one are vaccinated do they agree with you on."
16610.0,Patient,The book evolved like it's your choice.
760.0,Provider,That they.
16610.0,Patient,"They will be able to like they both do like where i'm already i'm already their home, I already there with them like to give enough but it's easy for them."
760.0,Provider,Because why because they're going on with there. You are.
16610.0,Patient,"Again, and they both. married and they both live with there's anything of another's they're both not here. And the world as well. rob and except for the one person who should talk to the one person who should be getting this damn house, as you can and I told her was like a make a movie about a month ago, when she got to the hospital, if you do have to head on his shoulder. He gave him a heart rate over here. You know don't tell me, the more we showed it on and and just snowball snowball into a fight, you know, and I just I you know I can see, I can make me healthier but. I thought brother and my brother was like answer choice you can't force her you know she's older and she doesn't want yeah that's her choice you know yeah I don't own."
760.0,Provider,"Just true, but I also think that it's kind of a matter of time even she could get it from a doctor's office she could get it from going to the den. yep she you know she. Typically, the chances The longer this virus is out there when it's running you know we just got over a time that was kind of intense I think it's getting better now with the numbers lately but statistically I just don't. want to encounter."
16610.0,Patient,Joe has.
760.0,Provider,"No way to go, I mean."
16610.0,Patient,That souza exactly what I told. Her so in in your in your.
760.0,Provider,"Case i'm just i'm suggesting that. Understanding can't force her to get the vaccine she's made the choice. And you've been a very careful son. you've been very careful for yourself you've been really concerned with your own health you're very concerned with her health so. You know. try to find ways to try to find things to do, to be more balanced, so that you can feel more satisfied with life. No churches one suggestion. You know, maybe going out on hikes with friends like that, because that's the open air, especially with spring coming up not too long from now. I know you like to walk be you know going to I don't know send them in Santa Monica go through the mountains or you know got a lot of really nice state parks here in California. Finding things to do to reconnect with people you eat hiking clubs and then maybe seeking out the people who are. Faced with Kobe there's there's a whole group of people who have the same kind of mindset like you and I, when it comes to call that we want to be careful and cautious seek those people."
16610.0,Patient,don't see.
760.0,Provider,The people that are careless.
16610.0,Patient,"yeah I guess that's just true yeah but I mean the whole the whole hour we spend on it was half an hour that I always basically That is why I am a little. depressed and anxious and that doesn't help me, you know. verse enjoy. him came in here every situation directly affects my life. yeah."
760.0,Provider,"And so it, but it limits your choices and it's good to focus on. What, what are the choices that you have that are your choices not spending on a large amount of time, focusing on what are the choices that are hers because that's very stressful and there's nothing you can do with it. there's nothing you can do, but what are my choices, I can move out. I can continue living the way i'm living I can go out and keep myself, you know, maybe go out maybe once once or twice a month and kind of quarantine in my room for a couple of days after. Finding things try to get creative with it because start thinking. or start processing how you're going to be. comfortable because again when we live in either extreme in life it's one of us. So. trying to find ways to reduce the risk. Because you're never going to get the risk to zero. you're never even with the best seen it so wouldn't be zero."
16610.0,Patient,"All right, I appreciate your time someone I know you're going on we're set up for next Tuesday same time."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
16610.0,Patient,"No, no march i'll probably do the same applies for March. yeah."
760.0,Provider,And just keep up with here you're still doing your affirmations and your walk.
16610.0,Patient,"Every every day, listening to him speak confirmations into existence in a mindfulness every day okay good I sit quietly in a breathing all the time. Okay well."
760.0,Provider,start giving out of the box of thinking of where can I meet people in general. and seek out the people that are focused on bettering themselves in some way and and our. consider it and we're you know concerned about things so that would be my suggestion start thinking about.
16610.0,Patient,Okay. Okay well do Thank you so much.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and yes, see you next week."
16610.0,Patient,Take care God bless have a good week and. Next week.
