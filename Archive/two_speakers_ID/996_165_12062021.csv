996.0,Patient,yep I can hear you.
165.0,Provider,"Okay, so, so I talked to vicki over at the pharmacy and I left a prescription for her or for you there with her. it's just a two day supply because you have medication through the end of tomorrow. what's going on with the prior authorization is that you actually aren't having an issue with prior authorization and medicaid has a zero tolerance. Policy, meaning that you have to wait until your prescription is due to get it it's the day after you run out and so that's all that's happening just I would just make sure that you call there before."
996.0,Patient,"You go, because I was the day after, and they still made me pay cash they kept on saying there was that, like my insurance they paid for my church and it was Wednesday like. Wednesday is the day that I run out, I run out tomorrow, tomorrow I run out and then Wednesday like I have none, and I was in there on Wednesday and like. I just they keep on giving me different excuses like they see all right, I appreciate your help and everything like that, yes, I said i'll just call you guys, a call somebody if they give me any more trouble or whatever with it."
165.0,Provider,"yeah call your insurance. You can't like yeah call us or your insurance, because your insurance is going to be more clear on exactly what's happening, but they don't you don't need a prior authorization for this medication for this dose it just you just don't need one. Okay okay okay."
996.0,Patient,"yeah so like so i'll be able to pick it up on Wednesday. All right. All right, thank you Mitchell. yep Thank you."
