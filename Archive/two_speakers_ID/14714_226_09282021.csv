14714.0,Patient,Good morning.
226.0,Provider,hey how are you today.
14714.0,Patient,Good how are you.
226.0,Provider,good to see you.
14714.0,Patient,You too.
226.0,Provider,"All right, tell me check in with me tell me how things have been going."
14714.0,Patient,"everything's going well. I did I missed my group on Friday, which I called in about I had a event, my with my company we weird anyway, it was a shotgun clay shooting event with one of our clients. So kind of a long, long hot day but anyway yeah I mean everything's fine everything's good. I don't you know, have any any really issues going on i'm just trying to stay on top of all my meetings and obligations and um you know i've got i've been hearing from my attorney that I have court date coming up in October, so it's kind of Nice to finally hear something."
226.0,Provider,yeah for sure yeah.
14714.0,Patient,"Sorry, let me send this i'm getting another call to climb that. Hope I didn't just hang up there, we go okay yeah just nice to sort of like get that last that last piece of the puzzle but get the legal stuff going, you know it's been like radio silence for over two months, which was kind of strange."
226.0,Provider,"yeah you know that's. that's not uncommon now because. You know it's just kind of the legal system and just the way this stuff works and so. You know, hopefully, when you go to the Court date in October you're going to have an idea. If you'll have to do the inner lock. In the community service hours and he finds anything I don't know how it works out there might be a little bit different."
14714.0,Patient,And yeah I don't eat me just one sorry this thing's making noises let me shut this email down here there we go yeah I don't know I don't know how it works either i'm i'm you know expecting a lot of. A well rounded punishment will put it that way.
226.0,Provider,"we'll see so usually okay so typically. Okay, so your driver, so you might get your driver's license back just to let you know that's not going to work for you right because you got it uber so. You know it's something to discuss with the Court in terms of just your job situation and. I. mean obviously through your attorney but because they're not going to let you drive right, I remember you saying."
14714.0,Patient,"Right right yeah it almost doesn't matter what happens in the court because my company. doesn't. You know it's like i'm uninsurable to drive around on their behalf. it's more for me it's more about like I want to get into the Court and I want to start the punishment to get the clock ticking you know just to. Just to just. get it going right, I mean. nothing I can do to change what happens so it means we'll just."
226.0,Provider,"Right. yeah so you know, usually. So there's so sometimes. Most times what happens now is that the courts will do what's called an interlock system so it's a it's a breathalyzer. it's put into in the car so obviously this is for people that have to. You know, get to work or have jobs, like yours, where they're out and about so that instead of like suspending their license and not making it possible for them to get to work or work. The interlock system is put in that's typically be I think it's there from anywhere from six months to a year so that's something that you pay for you pay, to put it in and it's a monthly like $200 a month okay The other thing that you might have or some community service hours. And you might have. Some fines. But as I recall, you don't know what your blood alcohol was right yeah."
14714.0,Patient,"No, they still haven't I still don't know that that's that's kind of still up in the air, so."
226.0,Provider,With that could also be in. sort of like a full blown dui that could be a wet reckless and some States will do that so it's I mean it's kind of like a step down from a full blown.
14714.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. i'm not holding my breath for that, but we'll see."
226.0,Provider,"All right, and I mean it's kind of interesting to you that you didn't get that like he didn't know what your blood alcohol was usually that's, the first thing that they'll show you."
14714.0,Patient,"yeah it's weird they didn't do a breathalyzer on me, they just. I don't know."
226.0,Provider,Did they do a blood test once they took it.
14714.0,Patient,"That they did yeah yeah and so that's that's what's weird is, I still just I don't have anything back yet and my lawyer even thinks it's weird because he's you know he's like look I requested the dmv trial, I requested the date. i've got the court case Center like I have everything they just they haven't produced the the blood alcohol yet so."
226.0,Provider,He might have lost it.
14714.0,Patient,Well that's kind of what i'm thinking which you know.
226.0,Provider,"So if they lost it then I don't know you know, like. Are they gonna they don't have much they lost it right."
14714.0,Patient,yeah yeah so we'll see we'll see.
226.0,Provider,I mean you know you obviously have the right attitude. Like. You know your tackle it as it comes to.
14714.0,Patient,"You know there's just nothing I can do you know just better just still waiting i'm just more focused on everything else, then, then. You know the Court thing I mean that's really why I hired the Attorney wasn't to fight it just have someone that knows what they're doing go and handle it and tell me where to be and when and what to sign and just be done."
226.0,Provider,Exactly yeah. um okay so How has it been for you like being around clients that are maybe drinking or How has it been like entertaining clients without drinking.
14714.0,Patient,"You know it hasn't been too bad I mean i've been doing, like weekly lunches with clients. Some of them like at the beginning, they none of them wanted to have a drink, so I think they feel bad and I was kind of like guys, this is. This is kind of like a this is going to be a long time so don't not have a cocktail because of me so like you know. So they started having it hasn't really been bad because you know I think i've mentioned that earlier in the year I went. Basically, two full months in January in February, without drinking and then I went all of May, but none, excuse me, all of June, without drinking just sounds kind of on a health kick so. It has it's been you know, three of the first you know, whatever one hour in the ninth almost the 10th month so three of the first. Oh shit now it's been five five of the first nine months of the year, have been all not drinking and entertaining so it's kind of just reverting back to that pattern so. Not not a big issue really I mean. You know, do I wish it had never happened and I could still just kind of have the same freedoms, I had before sure, but as far as the actual drinking part that doesn't really not that big a deal, you know so."
226.0,Provider,"So after all of this is. completed, and you know you go to court and you complete right heart how like what are your plans around drinking."
14714.0,Patient,"So you know I don't I don't know yet um I mean, certainly not to ever drive again after drinking like that's that's kind of a given. I don't know I mean I I I don't think i'm never going to drink again right, I mean it just doesn't to me that doesn't seem realistic that at some point. On vacation with the family or at my kids weddings or Adam you know, having a beer with my son, the day he turns 21 or something like I just. I don't feel as though I had any like issue that would require me to never drink again I just think that I got a little irresponsible with like my pattern of drinking, and so I think. More than anything, I just don't want to fall back into the pattern, where I was drinking as much as I was, because you know. Like I told you before my wife didn't you know love when I would come home buzz and was less you know, I was still able to like you know. I do, the majority of the cooking in the in the House, and so I was still you know come home and cook and help with the dishes and do bath time and storytime and all that but. There was definitely times, where I wasn't as I guess present you know with this, I just don't want to miss any moments with my with my kids really and so that's that's The one thing i've noticed is being. Completely sober i'm like you know, like the I don't know, maybe the last hour when i'm in the room, with both of them, they like to like shoot hoops on this little hoop and dance for out into office. Basically i'm just trying to get their last bit of their energy up. it's a it's really fun, you know i'm thinking like man I don't think I was really like President for this sometimes before so just don't really want to miss any of those moments or or have them have me missing the moments more Cox guy will not stop calling. Okay. Oh yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Like, how do you okay so let's say you go back to drinking. howdy how are you know how will you know that that pattern of drinking is creeping back up let's say. hypothetically. Like yeah I will you know that that's happening to you."
14714.0,Patient,"You know I don't know, I think, basically, the MoDem and now is i'm not drinking and you know my friends and clients and wife, and you know family know that so that's just like. The plan for right now, but I think I would need to talk to you know my wife and. and get other people and just be like what do you So what do you guys think like what. What i'm drinking around you, what do you, what do you think is a good, you know period of time or number of drinks or or whatever like just to make sure, because you know I don't think it should just be just like some arbitrary thing I come up with like okay Tuesday Wednesdays. You know, to cocktail or whatever you know but yeah I mean setting setting some like I guess limits or or. scheduling it, so to speak, so that it's fair to everybody involved would be probably the way to go, I don't know I mean I. What i've been doing earlier in the year I like it was kind of like I hate to say it like this, but it was almost like appointment drinking it was like okay so. I need to be productive and trying to you know, trying to lose weight and be healthy, and so I was like Okay, you know some drinks on my 40th birthday is one thing drinks on. You know, fourth of July is another thing you know those types of things, but not, not the daily you know go down to the bar after lunch type thing I think that's. What that schedule or frequency is I don't know or I mean I may not do that, I might go down there and just buy drinks that's what I was doing for a long, long time. And I have just as much fun it like so after the shotgun event on Friday, you know, I was when I. Was with my my my biggest client and, and so we we went down with him and then the refinery we were down there with the whole leadership team, and you know I had no problem I had bought a couple drinks and. Just had some non alcoholic beers and hung out, it was Santa fun is normal, you know so."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
14714.0,Patient,"I can still do everything I need to do, I just what I don't want to do is is. You know, have to have too many drinks and. You know, like I said not be not be what I want to be for my wife and kids so."
226.0,Provider,"Right so. that's sometimes like the best laid plans don't work out okay and and i'll be honest with you, especially around alcohol."
14714.0,Patient,And yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know, and of course even even drives and so i'm not saying any of this is going to happen we're just having a conversation, because I think that it's clinically. Responsible to have a conversation about it, you know we're just kind. of exploring. Different avenues we're just having different discussions about. You know, alcohol use certainly doesn't mean you have a problem and. So. One way, one thing that you can do you know, and you did mention this is to you know, have a conversation with your wife like if you do decide to go back like let's say all of the steps behind you. And you do decide say hey you know I think i'm good if you come in a good place, I want to try. You know, being well, I want to drink again. I don't want to go back to the way I was drinking. Because I was. present at home. So there has to be some kind of conversation that you guys have."
14714.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Well, she says. No more. yeah or you know you're doing this, I can manage this is manageable, this is OK. Because realistically, it could spec up. it's just it just says yeah and. something to be aware of. again. i'm not saying that it's going to happen, you don't know right we don't have crystal ball and you might decide like hey i'm really happy or not drinking I feel better if you're clear mentally and you know, like things are just flowing really well for me who knows. But. You know just having an honest conversation with people around you if you decide to go back to drinking and go hey you know, this is, this is the deal, and I need. You know if i'm if i'm stepping out of bounds when we have a signal we need that conversation, and then you have to like really go Okay, if your wife says yeah i'm not happy with her drinking, then you gotta take a step back and go Okay, well, I can drink."
14714.0,Patient,"yeah yeah exactly when that's kind of what the in my mind I guess the plan would be used, you know, like if if i'm going to have. A drink or or go back to drinking, so to speak, it might just be where I do that at home with her right so that way you know any like. Any changes that needed or any stop to it or changes or you know, like chicken kind of you know. Not babysit me or police me, but you know, like at least it's it's like having input in the moment that's fair for for her and and you know not like the kids they're so young, they you know they. They wouldn't have input, so to speak, you know but. Right yeah I just want just want to be fair, really."
226.0,Provider,And then remind me again. How long are you going to have to go around for work.
14714.0,Patient,"You know I, I have no idea I mean the way they made it sound was until. Until the dui is expunged from my records, I mean that could be three years."
226.0,Provider,Seven years.
14714.0,Patient,Seven years yeah I mean I I don't know I don't know how that's gonna work.
226.0,Provider,yeah that's interesting musty you eyes. yeah it's like usually seven years.
14714.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I I don't know if they so they're a Texas based company and I just I don't know if they have this whole thing really figured out quite frankly I just think that. You know they knew what had happened, I reported it Protocol would have been to terminate me, and so they didn't. terminate me they change my. position to inside sales instead of outside sales and I just said, look you can't drive for the company anymore so they're essentially hiding it, you know is what they're doing. So, which i'm grateful for you know. So. I think I think i'm I mean i'm basically planning on not driving for this company really ever again, I mean it's what it sounds like so. Because the company's for sale, and so, quite frankly, when the next company comes in, to buy this company and looks into everything I may be looking for a job, then anyway, you know, like that. there's a lot of uncertainty with this whole situation. You know. So the good news is is my wife went back to work. And she'll know in another month or or or she's not she's been working for a month she'll know in about another three or four months whether they're going to hire her full time at the contract. And I had already sorted decided I didn't really want to stay with this company long term so. i've got a couple. people that are recruiting the right now, and so i'm sort of slow playing it just because. You know I don't want to get into the interview process with anybody and then go and, by the way, gotta do is like probably can't drive for you either you know."
226.0,Provider,"Right, so that would have to be addressed to because. When they do a background check the time to do it."
14714.0,Patient,"For sure yeah yeah exactly so you know just I don't know i'm just not in a hurry to make a move everything seems to be working the way it is now there's no timeline for when this company might sell again, I mean it's you know it's just who knows yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. Fine, you just roll with it, you know."
14714.0,Patient,yeah I mean. there's nothing I can control yeah.
226.0,Provider,Right exactly. Okay.
14714.0,Patient,"So I. think the best thing for me is just the keep you know complete you know this program complete whatever community service just get. chip away at the whole problem, bit by bit, so that if and when somebody looks into it again whether it's my current employer or a prospective employer. Right, you know i'm i'm further down the line than I am now."
226.0,Provider,Is.
14714.0,Patient,The only thing.
226.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and you just want to be able to say that you've done everything that you needed to do with this, do you lie, you know community service hours all that stuff you know you just want to bring that's that's obviously The goal is to get it behind you. yep Okay, so you do know when your next court date is because will make another appointment so i'm not sure how you want to do that you want to wait to see when the."
14714.0,Patient,"I don't know, let me, let me see can I do this without hanging up on your head, let me go back to let's see what the Attorney said. Okay, so he just said October, so I don't know when it is."
226.0,Provider,OK.
14714.0,Patient,"So I also have this weird email, what is this, so I have an appointment with a monique Castro for a clinical communication assessment on October 1 at noon."
226.0,Provider,October What was it. First okay.

A new email each week and it turns out that complete the same survey each week, so I didn't know that I didn't do a survey last week but. i'll do it for this week."
226.0,Provider,To you know it's when you're supposed to do.
