2734.0,Patient,sure.
418.0,Provider,hey Kevin how are you.
2734.0,Patient,Know great.
418.0,Provider,signed up oh boy.
2734.0,Patient,"well. So. Monday okay I. i'm bad i've been making all my appointments and everything you know because I had a missed appointment a while back ago. And so I was on bridge script for ever. Okay, and the reason I was on brisket forever is because I there was out, you know, on. You know, on on us out for a brief period, he said he was doing some pediatrician work. You know, for juveniles. Okay, so he was out for a good two three weeks so you know, I was on bridge group for ever yeah."
418.0,Provider,or ever.
2734.0,Patient,"Ever I mean. It could have every four days I had to go to progress, and you know. pick up my script every four days every four days and that happened, you know for like three weeks there so that kind of sucked because you know Isaiah was an N, and you know you eat my doctor so he's when I wouldn't need to talk to. So, finally, he comes back, and I was like you know, it was a happy hour Okay, you know I make all my appointments and everything you know, so you know I should be able to get back on my regular you know. To leak script okay and here's a guy he goes I said well i'm not you know I know you just got back so i'm not even worried about it because I only got a couple more days. Of a you know someone's but this refund go out and then uh i'll just see you next Monday, and this one will do it so Monday came yesterday. and I go to update my zoom APP. Because you know i'm logging on for group and everything and it says zoom needs to be updated so I go to update zooming guess what happens. it decides the race all the information, like all my links, so now sudden I don't have my group my I don't have yours, I don't have Karen navigate I don't have anything is completely blank. And I was super mad because you know I should have just log into group and said forget, you know, David zoom but I figured it might be important update you know and it might not work if I didn't do it. So, of course, you know, and so I missed my my group so Finally, when I got in finally got able to get numbers, I had to go back and made a list long time ago. But I had to find out where I wrote it down at you know so Finally I found my list of numbers, I got into care navigator and the guy you know I tell you so chicken good job, so another group. But there wasn't because I had got gotten it like bottle and 15 I was like whew you know I can make the full group. But no, I let me in and care navigator was like you know they told me said, they said there wasn't no other group I was like oh man, I was like you know here yeah miss no appointments. And I told him I was like you know i'm so mad and frustrated because this is the second time that's happened with zoom. I was like so you know why this shouldn't count against me knows that because I definitely it should show that I logged in, and then the damn thing you know when I updated it that's what you know. But I don't know what's going on there, because you know I never tell you enough, and so I had to do all these surveys, I had to do a program video and. And then, so you know i'm out of meds you know because it to me, you know i'm on track, you know, like i've been on track, and you know. When they gave me my script Saturday, they gave me six pills, and I thought well okay so don't really pushed me, you know you're gonna have me go to a Monday morning. To go group i'm thinking you know so when I go to group Monday that's maybe that's my day is going to give them like two weeks prescription, you know 3035 he knows usually what he does 3038 I think. And I was like so I guess he put me back on track, you know for two weeks so must must be going on. So, then, I you know. I get to hear a navigator and everything I do all those things, so I do that for over an hour and a half, you know filling out all those surveys doing a video program video and everything participation. And then I go to our services. Well i'll and I wouldn't let me show you what so here's the new update the zoom does did you, you might like that. Okay cuz so Can you see Can you see me my phone."

So that's pretty cool I think that's really awesome that you know you can so my phone is dying, you know I could switch I can switch to another device and it doesn't doesn't end this session, you know I mean. yeah so that's pretty cool I think it's really cool because you know I got the zoom APP phone three different devices, so I oh like yeah that's pretty damn cool so anyway that's what the data store so. gotcha um. So I go to our services, you know, to get a bird script until you know Thursday so so I can do to make a group okay. So I go to our services, and you know they asked them what's going on tomorrow, our scripts and they're like no. You should be five days be your five days ahead of time i'm like huh. And like when you meet them five days ahead of time she goes, you should still have five more days, where I was like no like Saturday only gave me six. And shoes so she grabbed off, you know she read off to me to script the last trip I just had film and didn't she's she's reading it, she said, you know we've an orphan. Eight milligrams to tablets a day and I said ha. that's where the problem started right there so here bait when Daniels the the doctor mcdaniel when we had when I had her before Dr Dan. I had mentioned to her, you know I didn't want to have to do these pre prior authorizations every three months, you know because. That one time I did the prioritization it to two whole days that I almost went without script you know mean and that really sucked. So you know, and here I was going to withdraw yesterday you know that's why you know and so she told me what happened is so they took me off the two and a half. That I was getting over a month ago. But no one said anything to me. And I didn't read it on the you know because I."
418.0,Provider,"was already so so if i'm understanding you correctly, what you're saying is they decreased your dosage. Right and they did not inform you."
2734.0,Patient,Knowing and for me.
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so you continue to take."
2734.0,Patient,You to two and a half a day.
418.0,Provider,"To do this, okay two and a half a day. Right and it's really supposed to be how many a day."
2734.0,Patient,"Now I found the two. So that's how I got five days behind for a whole month now, and no one had told me. And i'm like you know, so I was like wow you know, no one had said anything to me whatsoever about me being decreased the two so you know i've been picking up my scripts. And you know here, knowing the pharmacy that and saying you know, because you just go on you pick up the script and and I bet it was on the paperwork I should read it, you know that it probably said two milligrams a day, but when I get my script to hurry and get home or strip my papers. In Ohio so you."
418.0,Provider,So you're literally.
2734.0,Patient,Literally yesterday.
418.0,Provider,Out of medicine.

2734.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no ya know it director for the tablets um I was a I had took my suboxone that night. Okay, because, like i've been taking two and a half a day, so I always take a half a pill at night desperate Daniel had given me to have to at night to lose so i'd be able to sleep."
418.0,Provider,"So how many days worth of medicine, did you get."

2734.0,Patient,"My knowledge, I thought I was just waiting to a Monday."

2734.0,Patient,"until Monday, because every time I would go to group."
418.0,Provider,hold on don't don't do that.
2734.0,Patient,i'm trying to explain you desk and.
418.0,Provider,I don't want you right.
2734.0,Patient,Every Monday.
418.0,Provider,"I don't want you to explain honey, I want you. just hear me okay. Okay, so they gave you a script on Saturday right. And you and you were to get a refill on Sunday."
2734.0,Patient,yeah.
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you're going to get one on Monday okay Monday alright, so that means you would have taken your last dose on Sunday."
2734.0,Patient,Right.
418.0,Provider,"Sunday Okay, so you would have you would have taken your last dose on Sunday, because they were giving you two a day and you thought it was supposed to be two and a half a day. Right. So how many did they give you."
2734.0,Patient,They give me six.
418.0,Provider,"Six Okay, they gave you six total. So if they gave you six total how many did you have left you had none left for the holes Monday."
2734.0,Patient,"No, I had my morning one, but that was it."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so you had. that's not adding up if you had to hold on if you had to on Monday. yeah I understand that if you had to on Monday to on Sunday, even if you took a half. You I even have."
2734.0,Patient,"32 and a half, on Sunday. Saturday first thing in the morning. And then I usually take the other one by 6pm but. They had me stressed out like it was be you know where I was feeling."
418.0,Provider,"hold on a minute so. That would have been five and so Monday, you only had one left."
2734.0,Patient,nine and a half left.
418.0,Provider,So you still didn't take it right is what i'm saying.
2734.0,Patient,yeah because no one told me that I had dropped down.
418.0,Provider,"To 10,000 and if it were supposed to be two and a half right. That meant you on Saturday between Saturday and Sunday, you would have taken a total of five."
2734.0,Patient,Right.
418.0,Provider,"Well, you should have had a whole one left. You said you had a half one."
2734.0,Patient,"yeah you're right, no, it was no as a whole as a whole."
418.0,Provider,"that's why that's why but that's why it doesn't seem right okay so that's why it doesn't seem right because you didn't have it right, because you kept saying I only had a half one."
2734.0,Patient,But.
418.0,Provider,"I was getting sick and you should have had a whole one if you were taking the medication properly at two and a half. Right, who would have had you know what I mean."
2734.0,Patient,"When I had one morning. But the thing the thing was that that. They just made me sick to it yeah I don't know I just I felt. Because I dug a thing on you know I mean like I don't know you probably don't know you know. he's been on vacation. Well, you know he had he had his thing juvenile thing."
418.0,Provider,I know I know Isaiah has been.
2734.0,Patient,out I get that and now he's out again right.
418.0,Provider,"I understand that. i'm realize it doesn't matter. Who the prescriber is because we all are proving. To what's going on, so but. Yet you also have to understand that the prescriber is responsible for this medicine. And so they take it very cautiously and seriously about dosages and how much. Now I will tell you for for us to be as professional as we we are and try to be it's it's."
2734.0,Patient,i've been one on one meeting buddy.
418.0,Provider,"I find the journey, I find it a little bit stressful to for you yourself to have gotten gotten a script for that long and not know that it was down."
2734.0,Patient,I mean.
418.0,Provider,They had it down to two for how long.
2734.0,Patient,But see that's that's what i'm saying.
418.0,Provider,Is if they had a dress he.
2734.0,Patient,"was writing a script for an extra three a day you know, an extra you'd give us extra day dosage you know, so we wouldn't have the trouble of worrying about trying to make it on time and being without. You know, so he would give us one extra days worth."
418.0,Provider,"But if you are listening to me and hearing what i'm saying. Even if you were taking your medications at two and a half, because you had no idea that they had changed it to to. know you would have been short more than just this time."
2734.0,Patient,"yeah no sector i'm saying. They fit shells five days ahead of time here, I had been getting them, you know, to me, I was getting them every week on time. that's what I was, I was thinking, because I would get my refills on Thursday every Thursday because Dr I see I see groupon on Monday. And then every Thursday is when I would get my refill but then, when I was started calling programs, they would be like you're you're early you're early and i'm like."
418.0,Provider,"Why don't know why. Because really they should only if you only supposed to be how how it normally works is, and I am going to convey this to whomever is taken over Isaiah. The day you're supposed to come to treatment you shouldn't have anything left. You should you shouldn't have anything left that day. That would be okay, because, even if you went an entire even if you had group at night, you know what I mean if you wait till nighttime you wouldn't be sick or anything because of the half life. If that makes sense there's still medicine in your system that's the importance of taking the medicine every day all the time, you know it's prescribed because you'll always have that medicine in your system, it is not."
2734.0,Patient,Marshall feel physically sick.
418.0,Provider,But it's not our desire for you to have to go through that. So I believe what Isaiah was saying was he's not prescribing extra you gotta watch the words he's prescribing you the day of.
2734.0,Patient,Treatment okay.
418.0,Provider,"He will prescribed you have right to the day, instead of, and if you come to treatment today's Tuesday, so if you come to treatment on Tuesday Isaiah was making sure you had your medicine for tuesday's. A lot of times, people were were having medicine up until Monday. And then Tuesday they'll get that. You know so it's not extra it's just the way the prescriber chooses to do it."
2734.0,Patient,"Right, well, I understand all that and that's that's not even what i'm even here to talk to you about because you know what what I meant what I was saying is that if I had not I did not know my dose. And so yesterday when I found out that all made sense, finally, you know why why, when I was calling program day was like your early, we can fill it today and I, you know, but like I you know."
418.0,Provider,"Those conversations they never said to you. Two and a half, you never thought to."
2734.0,Patient,"Remember, they never said to me what."
418.0,Provider,"When you said i'm not early I get two and a half a day, what do you mean i'm early i'm out right now, this is how many I have. Normally that's the conversation."
2734.0,Patient,"will see that's the problem I call I call up there and it's different person every time, and so we girl, and they are just check out girls, so I never talked to a pharmacist got the farm there's only one farmer staring he's the God. So, and I know I talked to him, because you know he he he actually gets on there and tells you everything you know everything everything you know, and so what and i'm used to going to kroger you know and. So yeah i've never had a conversation with anybody about it getting lowered, I did not even know that it had been dropped down with you today, though that's what that's what i'm saying is. That time. Right i've been. i've been taking two and a half a day."
418.0,Provider,"yeah i'm not clear on that because anytime there's a change in your medicine, not only they have a conversation you didn't get any emails about changes nothing."
2734.0,Patient,"Nothing I got me I thought my Google and send it to you I got nothing. Not an email about my doses being loaded or anything that's what. And I want to talk to you in a way, but I just thought that I would it would have been conveyed to me by doctors am but you know i'm. don't don't process has changed a little bit."
418.0,Provider,I ask you a question why did they lower your notes.
2734.0,Patient,"Okay, because i'm. When it, this is what i'm assuming Okay, this is this is assumptions, this is not black and white, you know not written in stone. My assumption is okay, when I had Dr Danielle I had to go through that prior authorization that pre The pre authorization thing. Okay, and I didn't want to go through that again because you know I will almost the whole day without any meds and you know. I literally had to borrow medication just to get through that day and they didn't they didn't replace it, you know they don't care that you borrow medicine that's just too bad that days gone you lost out. So, and I explained it Dr Danielle and I said, you know, I was like, so I would like to start lowering. myself to get down to where we can just be back at to where I don't have to have that prior because you only when you go go up to do you have that you have that prior authorization every three months. When you're at the two you only have to have that once a year. Right so so I told her you know i'd like to the before the next prior authorization comes, I would like to start lowering down to two before that time I like sissoko. She wrote in her notes that I would like to drop down but we're supposed to have a conversation about it well guess what and then the next week that's when we found out she was leaving. You know so she probably left it in our notes or something you know, like noise student doctor is he has seen the notes and. assumed that I had already you know knew that that I was getting dropped down or something on a certain day I don't I don't have no clue really honestly. But yeah that's that's what my assumption is that that he must have read the notes and seeing now is getting up to, but no one ever told me anything so I really don't know what's going on, so I haven't been able to talk to Dr Isaiah."
418.0,Provider,So what's the.
2734.0,Patient,"navigator has been sending thing either when I asked them, I tried to ask them, you know when this happened everything and they didn't have nothing for me that was like you like to just talk to whoever."
418.0,Provider,You can't talk right you the care navigators have right yeah that they can add.
2734.0,Patient,"Those are one day at least get something figured out, so I guess doctor is is the only one, I can talk to to find out what what happened and when it happened everything. And i'm just like so when. She gained. And then he told me. Not to know."
418.0,Provider,Richard Richard you can call you. Kenny i'm sorry. Thank you for. All your pharmacist.
2734.0,Patient,You called I.
418.0,Provider,"just call you. just call your pharmacist and say, can you tell me how long have I been at this dose. They got it right there."
2734.0,Patient,And they should have it okay and.
418.0,Provider,Of course. They have it right there I.
2734.0,Patient,"will do that that way, I could find out because i'd like to know. Oh, let me ask you to take place."
418.0,Provider,yeah um since it was five days off it seems like it hasn't been that long but i'm so you really haven't taken to a day yet. what's now how many days have you been taken to.
2734.0,Patient,"today's gonna be a two day to day today, just to be the first day i've got down to and hopefully what i've done is done this i'm going to take one at 6am 12pm 6pm to 12am. Or how red goes at 12:12pm at night i'm sorry."
418.0,Provider,So you know what I mean every six hours don't we take a half pill every six hours that.
2734.0,Patient,To make that work instead of taking. One every 12 hours. and not being able to not feeling good before I go to sleep this way I can go to feel good going to bed.
418.0,Provider,"How, let me ask you a question. you're now you're taking the pills and you're taking you're going to be taking two per day right. Right How long have you been in the Program."
2734.0,Patient,See about four months now.
418.0,Provider,"So you've been in the program for four months and for four months you've been on two and a half. Yes, Okay, so now you're going down a half a one so in I would suggest this. Because you want to be settled, you want to get yourself stable right. All right, you're doing all the other things because you tell me all the time you're doing everything you can do to just kind of keep yourself stable right would you try taking one in the morning and one in the evening."
2734.0,Patient,"i'll see what I did that, before. it's always at nighttime it before I go to bed, and I start to feel. nauseous, but that was when I was still you know coming in that's when I first started the Program."
418.0,Provider,You will do boxes.
2734.0,Patient,"I would feel nauseous when I would when I when I would, in the middle of night because I was taking it at midnight and in new. York 12 and 12."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, you were doing 12 and 12."
2734.0,Patient,Right so.
418.0,Provider,So if you okay tonight Where are you at for today.
2734.0,Patient,Today I just like I told you i'm good I just got done taken at half before seeing you and then i'm going to take another half at. midnight and then i'll take a half when I wake up in the morning.
418.0,Provider,"So instead of taking a half when you wake up in the morning, what time do you normally wake up."
2734.0,Patient,I normally wake up at 6am.
418.0,Provider,"So if you wake up at six o'clock. Why don't you try. To you know you go to the restroom go get some breakfast coffee or whatever after you have your cigarette whatever. Wait 20 minutes and then take your medicine take it what i'm saying is push it back a little bit, if you take it a little bit later, say, if you take it at eight o'clock and then you take the second one at 8pm. Do you think that that would hold you through the night."
2734.0,Patient,You know that probably would because I go to bed about nine.
418.0,Provider,"So, so if you go to bed at nine o'clock let's think about this, if you go to bed at nine o'clock Okay, and you take your medicine right before bed, or you take it like an hour before bed."
2734.0,Patient,"I take it right before but. I learned I take it, and then I get ready to go sleep within linkedin 20 minutes."
418.0,Provider,"So, then, that means you'd be taken at about 830. Right Okay, so if you take your medicine at 830 tonight, a full, I mean tomorrow night full dose because tomorrow morning, instead of taking it. Right at 6am as soon as you open your eyes you're gonna. open your eyes, take a deep breath you're gonna you know what I mean you're going to go to the restroom you and then you're going to wait that 20 minutes after you've had coffee cigarette and all that. yeah 20 minutes after then you're going to take your medicine and let it fully dissolve and have nothing to eat or drink or smoke for about another 20 minutes. Is that how you taking it."
2734.0,Patient,"kind of I usually take it. Full dissolve and. And then uh I usually I usually take it after I like I after I eat everything you know I get up I usually cook and everything first and users from hurting and then I come down to eat because. If I don't eat i'm nauseous, so I think the zoo friend and everything. If I don't you know if I take the pill, it will make me feel sick if I take a pill night."
418.0,Provider,So what to do.
2734.0,Patient,"So he's I eat before take it, because if I take it take it and try to eat. On his own friend just billy because. Something to suboxone the taste of it is just like really just move that and it kills all my desire to want to eat. or drink any go do."
418.0,Provider,"That so that's why i'm saying eat your breakfast have your coffee, but you have to wait that 20 minutes after I don't know if you've heard this before, but I usually go over how to ingest the medication, you want to wait that full 20 minutes before in 20 minutes after. So that what I mean is you've eaten you've had coffee you've had everything to eat no nauseous because you didn't take nothing right wait 20 minutes, with nothing. Then, take the medicine. And then, after it fully dissolves wait another 20 minutes before you smoke or drink or anything Okay, because, believe it or not, by not doing that, if you're not doing that then you're not allowing all of the medicine to get fully in your systems."
2734.0,Patient,Okay.
418.0,Provider,"Does that make sense. yeah and because I want you to calm, I want you to be relaxed, I want you to be calm um you know we're sorry about the unfortunate episode like nobody told you, you didn't know I. don't worry about it, you didn't know you didn't know what you can do you know so that's over it's done with with that we're down to today and we need to learn how to manage this to a day, so that you can get through without white knuckling it if that makes sense."
2734.0,Patient,Right understand as well i'm also going to.
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so I want to help you through that process, but I think that it's a force of habit that half oh my God it's time for another half. So my mind is racing more than you're getting anxiety for some reason cuz I could tell, even when you got on the phone you're really excited you really is. But I want you to be calm and I want you to know that you're okay you take your medicine everything. You don't have to panic you don't have to rush to take it it's not going anywhere. i'm going to take it properly, so that I can get it all in my system, the way it needs to be and I don't have to worry about it for the rest of the day. And now it's the evening it's time to relax it's time to settle in so i'm going to go ahead and get my medicine and then i'm going to get ready for bed. But. Take your medicine, first we 20 minutes before your brush or brush and then wait 20 minutes before you take your medicine. Okay."
2734.0,Patient,So 20 minutes in between the Dudes. That thing okay.
418.0,Provider,"Not a problem, do you want it to be fully in your system okay."
2734.0,Patient,Good yeah.
418.0,Provider,"But you're not in any kind of trouble there's no so so whoever's taking that group now. The fact that you've done all your surveys you've attended all your meetings you shouldn't have a bridge script anymore, so that that'll be over. It doesn't matter if I say is there, or not, the bottom line is if you've been compliant you should have no problem, and you should get your medicine okay. That makes sense."
2734.0,Patient,"yeah well I didn't know you know if I could talk to anybody else from now, you know because. When I go in there, you know I know that these people use other faces been there, but usually, when I get there two groups were just talking to the counselor and and, at the end of group does, when a doctor will ask you notice or anything that has changed in anybody's you know."
418.0,Provider,"yeah so sometimes what happens is they um some people wait till the end to do the medical and then some people do it in the beginning, when they you know, in the beginning of."
2734.0,Patient,"The noise at the end, and then the problem is that there were running out of time, because our groups always seem to be right at the point at 11 o'clock and so, and then it always ends up running over like because I am at 10am and then we don't get out until sometimes like 1058."
418.0,Provider,Okay.
