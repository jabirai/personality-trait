And young really hard for me, and you know the ladies who you know her parents kind of thing or like don't let her get away with anything that and i'm like. i'm not going to be hard on her she's going through a lot, the idea that you guys are gone kind of thing and very ball focused like. I don't care why I was doing in the House, I had to be like somehow put the throwing the ball kicking the ball doing something, and finally, it was a one point I picked up and was like no and she just went like coward and i'm like I just it was really hard, though. Now I mean she was their best. form like she didn't get sick to her stomach like the second day I was there, she threw up and. was pretty rough and things like that and. The two days in a row that I stayed pretty much close to home, I was at home last all day she was in really good form the next day and things like that so. i'm pretty i'm 90% sure it was all anxiety based. doesn't know how it feels."
226.0,Provider,You can relate.
15158.0,Patient,Every time she got weird or nauseous it felt like I got weird or not it's just it was like oh required team.

And I completely missed the meeting that I was just go to I I clocked on it six o'clock and come to find out the meeting was from five to six. And now. Last time I tried that because that was the last time they sent me a notice saying you have a meeting on this day kind of thing.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you didn't meet with her."
15158.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, no i'm so sorry I met with shot tell talk to her, she said Okay, I can understand you can go to your group therapy one time, a month."
226.0,Provider,got it.
15158.0,Patient,"And the last time I was, I was literally at work. Okay last thing I clicked on to be at the meeting at six and come to find out went back to my. notes, I was at five till six."
226.0,Provider,got it.
15158.0,Patient,So I can. heal the mistake.
226.0,Provider,Okay gotcha alright cool okay good.
15158.0,Patient,I had that. wellness coach on the 20th. Okay i'm kind of excited about that i'm kind of excited to see what that is. yeah exactly where we're going with that. And all those things.
226.0,Provider,"Yes, okay good. How did you feel that you're managing anxiety depression or is that going."
15158.0,Patient,"Like depressions been pretty much at bay well i'm busy. Yes, it. really been really hard. I guess I I. I waffle. Being not understanding why have anxiety, while i'm dog sitting. Well, no it's something that's real because I know it makes me very sick to my stomach and makes me very uncomfortable and. freaked out and yeah like it's it's super hard for me, though, to get involved in just a TV show and just go with it like you know you would think oh pick a day relax whatever i'm also noticing, and this is a. i've noticed this before by really knows it now is if i'm in a place where I need to hang out. I mean sunshine like I can't have like I need to be in a house. he's sitting, where I know the sun rises and like it's constant like I need a giant glass ceiling and it's. yeah I obviously need to marry rich, is what I need. A glass. ceiling tent but. yeah it's it's nerve racking and I deal with it in my car too it's like i'm constantly like chasing the sun."
226.0,Provider,really interesting.
15158.0,Patient,"I do have a light, but I haven't brought out of the box i've had it since last year i've used it maybe once I haven't brought it out of the box to like utilize it because I don't even. I guess i'll think about when i'm busy until i'm literally craving it like I said I start to like you know where I live, right now, my room. Get sun not like i'd like, but the living room has all windows. So I can go in through just sit anywhere. In the kitchen is pretty bright so i'm pretty safe to say that i'm always able to like find the sun and be somewhere here at home that makes me happy. But yeah it's it's an tentpole."
226.0,Provider,hmm I wonder if that's like a lack of vitamin D.
15158.0,Patient,"could be yeah I don't I don't know. And then, of course, when I get out, you know, like. i'm not out walking around a lot by myself, like out in the city walking rounds not something i'm dislike it's something I just don't care to and I probably don't do it mostly because I don't want to be around just I feel unprotected if i'm not in my car. we're in my space or in a space, I know, like I know Cisco sound strange but i've been going to a specific nightclub for 20 odd years 30 odd years, it seems, so I know. The people have would want to talk to, I know the spaces, that I like to stand and I know the places where to kind of hide out if I want to be by myself. So I always feel like there's certain places, when I go I know the protection mortars I guess i'm kind of like an animal in the sense of like I know which spots, I can hide if I know, things are going on."
226.0,Provider,But.
15158.0,Patient,yeah it could very much be. So yeah I don't know.
226.0,Provider,You know that might be something that you want to talk to do you have a primary care physician that you see that you.
15158.0,Patient,"Go to have an appointment coming up Oh, I am. I. went to the doctor and had X rays of my face."
226.0,Provider,Like that cool.
15158.0,Patient,"It was it was it was cute. To trainings, and so I spent I was like in there for like an hour with them i'm like i'm not in a rush to do that, but it was really kind of funny I was kind of like. Trying to go okay you guys so when you talk to somebody about tilting their head explain how you want them to tilt their head or turn their head or turn their body like you know, when you say turn to the right but turn to the right not just my head or. You know, it was really funny so it was quite it was quite. Moving in a way, I felt like we both helped each other. yeah good, and it was like hey this kind of chair isn't working for us because of this year and you're going to want to do if you're going to like all that, so thank you, you know, and it was kind of neat to be able to be like. I can, I feel like i'm being helpful by. But they. took the X rays, they didn't see a fracture they can see, they can see the swelling they can see the change of my face is different, they can see the indentation. But it's funny it's like within 24 hours after they told me that there was anything broken i've suddenly been able to start to like massage my face and work with my."
226.0,Provider,friends and still like.
15158.0,Patient,For longest time I was very leery of people being around me on the side of my body.
226.0,Provider,Because I was.
15158.0,Patient,"concerned about like anything hitting me or something like that. Well, so because they didn't it's not like I was figuring out a way of protect it honestly the mask was the only thing that felt like it was protecting it. But it was. Really uncomfortable and now it's starting to feel better I think now that I know that. in danger of being hurt more or something."
226.0,Provider,"And so. talk to your primary care about vitamin D, maybe. You know, you can take vitamin B. yeah I would just have a conversation. yeah like."
15158.0,Patient,"That and. You and I talked about that i'm going to talk with the wellness coach about. All the tests and blood work they did when I was they figured out was menopause and other things and etc, etc, so. yeah so i'll see if that's on my checkup list or whatever things I need but yeah."
226.0,Provider,interface hurting.
15158.0,Patient,"No it's just tight it's just uncomfortable like it just feels like the skins real tight around it, so the only thing I can think of is you know just created some a muscle like bruising and whatever adhesions or whether it's kind of like it just feels like. it's always constantly it feels like a piece of tape is on it, so I can kind of feel it always kind of like a weird sensation. But it's not painful and I. Am more careful by can sleep on it now like I cradle my head, so that it doesn't have any pressure on it when I if I sleep on my side. it's very strange I used to never sleep on anything but my back and then, when I started taking medication for my anxiety a definitely sleep all over the bed."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so what helps to what helps in that moment when you've got that anxiety, but. With hopes."
15158.0,Patient,"It really depends like if i'm very focused on an animal or something else. I try to walk myself through it like I don't have a very clear line of what. Like. I try not to tell a lot of people that that's what is going on in my life. Because most people. it's a dog and like that dog has as many feelings, as we do. it's just lucky that it doesn't understand everything to have all you know more more anxiety or more stress, but. yeah I just try to do my best to figure out what the best items. To make me feel better like. I did, probably take a quarter of an. advantage twice last week."
226.0,Provider,And does that How does that help calm you down yeah it does.
15158.0,Patient,"It makes me tired, it makes me a little bit sleepy which is it's calming I rather because, like."
226.0,Provider,Maybe a.
15158.0,Patient,relaxed and then like I said the nausea the anxiety such but the nachos the worst. Because like some every once while makes me throw up.
226.0,Provider,"Do you do any kind of deep belly breathing you know, like have a."
15158.0,Patient,"little bit, since you taught me. So i'm still not being really great about my yoga or my meditation and whatever i've gotten. Much better about. waking up in the morning, trying to bring myself kind of you know what am I thankful for what's."
226.0,Provider,going on.
15158.0,Patient,With the same with an evening before bed i'm trying to like really focus on setting myself on a path that I feel is really good for me.
226.0,Provider,"To have I told you about this book, have we talked about that."
15158.0,Patient,"i'd know a week I think I said I had the book, but I don't have the workbook like. A book that went with the workbook."
226.0,Provider,So this is one there's work in this is like the book and there's work there's.
15158.0,Patient,"No, I have not."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so the reason i'm asking is that this is, this is a really, really, really good book. Okay, and like it's the most like it's it's the best book out there, oh sorry that's. Okay um. And there's Chapter four. It talks about."
15158.0,Patient,Go ahead and show me the book again and i'll just make sure I. wow i've never actually like thought about phobia.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15158.0,Patient,"of anxiety, but in phobia. doctor is admin board okay. Beautiful go ahead, Chapter four."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so Chapter four talks about relaxation, and it really goes into abdominal breathing it goes into muscle relaxation because into oxygen consumption, you know decreasing analytical thinking. Like if it is the most comprehensive book that is out there, I mean it's incredible what it goes over. And it talks about. Like the cumulative stress cycles. How to reduce insomnia, and fatigue, but anyways in Chapter four it talks about abdominal breathing and it really breaks it down so increased oxygen supply to the brain and you know just your whole muscle muscle structure and. So. And then it breaks it down like how to do it. Okay Okay, so I think like if you can I got this book on Amazon."
15158.0,Patient,yeah i'm sure I could just do that.
226.0,Provider,"And I really recommend that you do this if you can get this book, I really, really recommend it."
15158.0,Patient,order as soon as we go on.
226.0,Provider,Let me add there's there's just so many so many good things in here. And you know it just goes back until it goes back it goes into letting go of perfectionism overcoming procrastination. delegation.
15158.0,Patient,That would be great because it like first of all I get super psyched about a project or an item like if I get that book i'm gonna be like you know. And then. Like okay sit down take the time take the time.
226.0,Provider,Take the time right.
15158.0,Patient,"lose focus, but the hardest part about something like that is like. You literally told me about abdominal breathing I."
226.0,Provider,Did.
15158.0,Patient,"You know, after we get off the phone I always like, for the first few days i'm like okay thinking about doing it, and probably reading about probably be better for me because they'll kind of stick but it's almost like. I just need to like. it's so funny I don't want my phone to ding it me to check in with me, because then that like makes me think about things, but then, on the other hand, I don't think like I need to like again i'm that person that needs like the sticky notes around the House, it says. So you know calm your breathing. Like a reminder, not a like oh God let's let's look at what's going on right now."
226.0,Provider,"Right right. and So, like it's as you were saying that there's something in here too it's talks about making a commitment to yourself to follow through on things."
15158.0,Patient,"that's gonna be the hardest step w very hard, today I know it, I need it."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. So one way of looking at it too is like it's a commitment that you're making to really reduce your anxiety you're really. Like you've got the time to be able to do that, like I would look at this is like your downtime here your time that we get to do. You get to do the work on yourself that you're you know ready for whatever you're ready to to focus on do it, you know, and one of those things is to absolutely try and reduce your anxiety. Just to develop coping skills Okay, so the first step, obviously, is like he developed these coping skills your may anxiety may never just completely go away. For us to know that okay. i'm feeling something coming on I know what I can do right now in this moment make me feel better. Okay, so depression, anxiety it's you have to do something, once a day and manage it, even if you're not feeling anxious, you have. It so it talks about that the deep abdominal breathing it talks about doing it every day will make a difference you'll feel it, you will notice a significant difference to three months down the road. So. You know when when it gets like ooh you know commitment follow through like oh my God I don't want to do it just go well Okay, this is me investing in myself and investing i'm giving myself a lot of love and attention. You know, like."
15158.0,Patient,"No, this would be so hard."
226.0,Provider,"Yes, and and then yeah and it's you know and what you yeah many people like i'll do like. exercises in group, like name one thing you love about yourself. And people have to rock their brains to come up with one thing they love, but, but if I said hey these five things you don't like about yourself, they could name 10."
15158.0,Patient,yeah so.
226.0,Provider,we're just conditioned that way. that's hardware condition.
15158.0,Patient,"it's really a bizarro fine line of like oh yeah i'm conceited and I have all level level and it's really funny when you see that. I immediately go Oh, that person has a lot of I don't like the word issues, but they have a lot going on, where they're not happy, like. putting up this front of like yes i'm great you know i'm awesome it's really kind of interesting because it's very hard for me to be like yeah i'm pretty damn good at this and I am proud of myself, you know."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and that's where you know, unfortunately that's just the society that we live in, and so the message is like oh if we talk about what we love about ourselves and we're arrogant and we're conceited and people don't like to be around people like that. Right there's there's a there's a very big difference when somebody sits there and constantly talks about themselves in a very kind of narcissistic way that's very different from saying you know I really love the fact that. i'm great with animals and i'm really empathetic and I work really well with people and I love that I have this great sense of humor I love that I have this amazing like great super cool street style and I rock it every day, you know. You know that that's different, and you know there's a huge difference and then, when I talk to people about you know self care. it's easy for people to get confused and think that that's selfish and self centered so if i'm doing self care and i'm not putting this person. You know, then that means that i'm i'm not attending to other people, the way that I need to attend to other people no that's not that's not it self care is is about you know you take care of yourself, you can help others."
15158.0,Patient,Right i'm always got that frickin. Put the mask on before the yourself before others kind of thing go into my head.
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely so it's like if you're not you know if you're not balanced and if you're not you know feeling, you know grounded and all this like how the hollies know like helping other people is just like kind of a distraction, and a diversion and it's a temporary you know. Because it catches up to you, over time, and then that's for depression creeps in and not spraying inside the semi now if you're not tending to your own self. Then you're really ignoring your needs you're ignoring what really makes you feel good about view you're ignoring the simple things in life that you're just kind of giving away to other people."
15158.0,Patient,yeah it's. it's crazy like. I don't I don't yeah I can't even imagine yeah it just that's such a weird world to think of.
226.0,Provider,mm hmm only.
15158.0,Patient,"And it never fails. And I honestly if I think I would master most all my things if I can grasp the concept of why other people's opinion matters. You know, but it never fails. it's like okay i'm going to do exactly what i'm supposed to do i'm gonna take care of myself here in the moment and then i'm going to be able to help over there. It never fails it somebody walks in and goes, what are you doing taking care of yourself over there, you should be over there, doing such and such and you're like, no, no, no, no, you don't get I just started this, it was only a minute, you know, like it's constant like that."
226.0,Provider,"And I think some of that was just from childhood, I think a lot of this work, people stands and childhood, the messages that we were you know told the things that were said, you know unsaid. said, you know covert over all that kind of stuff just the way you know the family unit operates, you know parenting styles what other kids. suck up each combination of things and so when you're little and you're bombarded with these messages that oh no, you know you're. you're you're a martyr you're selfish get over here and how you help your siblings don't be lazy and all that crap right. So, then, that travels with us into adulthood, and then we have all these mixed messages and we don't really know who we are and what makes us tick there might be parts of us that that. yeah you know i'm an adult I have this job I really like it or I don't like it had the set of friends even my interest in my hobbies but like what really makes you happy and tick it gets lost in in the Max. Right like we don't we don't really know like okay well yeah that really hurt my feelings, but I don't want to let that person know so i'm just going to bury these feelings 20 years of bearing your feelings. you're gonna have a lot of stuff eventually it percolates up to the surface pastor."
15158.0,Patient,"yeah it just it's it's. An interesting. it's a flower an interesting world to be in. Like i'm thankful that I feel like i'm being seen now. On the other hand, i'm sorry that the world's doing what it's doing kind of feeling like you know and. I mean there's everything from people that i've been connected with the. I was so impressed it like just who they are, and now they're not here anymore. The point of. Listening the radio, the other day, talking about so many people have anxiety, to the point where like. We have an abundance of jobs. called the resignation year. because so many people are like I don't want to go back to a job that makes me feel like that and it's like."
226.0,Provider,Just.
15158.0,Patient,"Somehow I feel like we just need a giant yoga resort for the whole United States to just everyone at one point we were supposedly doing that, but everyone wanted to fight about it, and now we're where we are now."
226.0,Provider,"Well, you know, so you know you bring up an interesting topic right because what's happening is there is a shift for people like people are no longer wanted to go back to these jobs that don't pay well that aren't. going to create a lot of anxiety and stress, you know, so there is a movement, hopefully that's going to be happening with this and and it's like, and you know, thank God it's like yeah I don't want to go back to that job. So something's gotta change, either within you or within the society and how people these employers treat. Their employees and how we live. Like just consciously you know just like how it is, I you know i'm hoping there's going to be shifts and changes are going to be made, and this is a big message to people like i'm not doing that anymore."
15158.0,Patient,yeah I mean and it's. Two different things i'm going to tap in on as one. it's like watching the movie or the TV show mad men.
226.0,Provider,like that is so funny i've only seen a couple of those those episodes but I was like wow.
15158.0,Patient,"amazing and you grass and it's really interesting that. You know, shows that tap into that. You know, really, the cool thing about them a lot of times they'll get into conversation with the actors and actresses and. How they think about some of it and, like sometimes it's just really like wow you know they're like right there dealing. Dealing with it, but they still know, deep down inside the person next to them their friend or their colleague it's good that and. To. Raw oh watching how. it's just interesting being intertwined with people who live outside the United States and literally like. The United States is like you're lucky if you get your two weeks you're lucky you're lucky if you get maternity leave and things like that. And just in general and how, like other countries, countries are like yeah okay good go you good luck you guys. Whatever you want to do because. We think it's crazy."
226.0,Provider,"So we, I mean it is it's insane that you work a whole year just to try and get two weeks off."
15158.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know, and just you know, to have women go back to work after three months there's like you know how it's like almost."
15158.0,Patient,even imagine what that's like. Like things I carry for a dog.
226.0,Provider,yeah right. And and and and just that the fatigue and sleepless nights that you're still having. To show up the next morning probably only on maybe two or three hours of sleep to do a whole eight hours worth of work and. it's.
15158.0,Patient,"Still, it seems like it's still like promoted and kind of been like the Blessed idea of like you're a woman."
226.0,Provider,Yes.
15158.0,Patient,"i'm like you don't you'll want to have kids and you're like no not the right things are going, why."
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely yeah I know. So you know I think you know just like I said, you know, taking this time to really like focus on how to reduce the anxiety just to gain these coping skills and really work on like the commitment it's a commitment to yourself. And if there's a barrier there like okay break that down what is that about why am I experiencing this Why am I experiencing you know, putting this off what is that what is that telling you how is that speaking to you if it had words What would it be saying. Trying to really, really happened to that."
15158.0,Patient,"The only I mean. not sure if this is where you're going with this, but, as you say it thing that pops up to me, is. Constant guilt that i'm not pulling my weight."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
15158.0,Patient,"Like my living situation i'm not I mean like I clean up the House they have somebody comes in every two weeks, and does the heavy lifting kind of thing. But you know I always put the dishes away and I always clean up the kitchen and help them make food, even though I mean we all get along great it's not but in a way it's like constant knowing sensation of like. kind of taken advantage of people here and it's not like anyone else was saying this to me."
226.0,Provider,When I.
15158.0,Patient,talk to each other every couple of days about certain things and be like okay this work cool.
226.0,Provider,"Right so with that you know it's like this really reality based is that that really, really, based in reality now. i'm."
15158.0,Patient,"just have an add. On it's super amazing to me now and i'm sure I think the last conversation, the last time we talked I talked about, but how I would say, a good. 2530 years of my life of just being like. things that were going on around me that were made me not true, or that embellish I have no earthly idea like how dramatic I made things how bizarre things were and then interestingly enough, as i'm making these like. You know far fetched claims that are you know, like i'm cool and this is that the other kind of thing or where my life is so horrible when the shit went South I was centered I was there I was like this isn't you know this isn't so bad we'll get through this. house burned down around me my mother tried to kill herself a couple of times like different things, I was like Okay, we got this. you're like you don't have extra clean underwear you turn it inside out you keep going like. survival mode when it was necessary. For was really spot on."
226.0,Provider,yeah and then it's not.
15158.0,Patient,yeah right.
226.0,Provider,"yeah you know it's it's a lot like as a child to experience that and. it's so traumatizing female and then again, you know that travels with you into adulthood, you can process it a little bit better you know. You might not disassociate like children that have the trauma and stress like that will disassociate you know."
15158.0,Patient,"What does that mean, in a sense of disassociate."
226.0,Provider,"you're just kind of shut down and they're just not present in that get out. And you know it's not uncommon pits that day during the live Beijing is the point of this association. You know you're just kind of mentally in a different place and, especially, you know I mean like sitting in a classroom which is boring and roles, you know, but that. yeah they're just kind of often their own little world that's this association that's just kind of giving yourself a break from all of us fast, and you know. Emotions but."
15158.0,Patient,Then yeah talk about changing gears. we're going to school every day. and probably putting on a face for that.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15158.0,Patient,"Like coming home not being sure what you're coming home to right. yeah I mean. That I used to like. Like right now, one of my state, one of my things is never to Sam wasting time."
226.0,Provider,Like.
15158.0,Patient,I happen to have a little downtime.
226.0,Provider,yeah absolutely yeah.
15158.0,Patient,When I was young man on man I I used to I wouldn't consider it wasting time but I used to always be wishing for the good stuff like I was never capable of like working through that every day. For the movie that was coming out or that little trip that was taking or.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so that's like giving yourself things to look forward to, so you can kind of get through the mundane and the painful you know that's that's. that's kind of not uncommon I think a lot of kids actually do that, especially that come from stressful situations like. That day today the not knowing you know, and so my guess is that the anxiety for you really started when you are yeah. But there were so many other things going on, you know kid like stuff that was still going on, that it wasn't accepting new the way now it's affecting you like it again it travels with you."
15158.0,Patient,"Right right, I mean back then, it was like. It was obviously I had a roof over my head. right on the table."
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's an. example, maybe a paid."
15158.0,Patient,"repentance for having those things, but it all seem to meld well."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and you know prayer for now, where you are it's like you know you're you're not wasting time you know, this is a really like find find the place in it, like in a gratitude in it, you know so when your mind starts to go to that place of i'm not contributing. And not doing enough, no i'm not working, and I, you know go to the place of notices i'm exactly going to be in this moment. And i'm so grateful that. This is happening right now, right here, right now, and so grateful for my situation. So it's about. it's about patching those negative those negative thoughts as negative comments that you."
15158.0,Patient,"Miss hard, because when they start. You certain things because you're catching them. And now all of a sudden you're processing them and thinking. about him and it's like no. talk to you about being thankful for things people not."
226.0,Provider,"So you want to get one that comes you just want it, you want to cut that off and then you want to go immediately just something that you're happy and grateful for. So it's just replacing a negative thought, with a positive thought so what you're doing is you're you're really working on those cognitive distortions there's there's thoughts that are really not productive the thoughts that are negative that come up. So you're. Productive right, so your cognitive distortions are about like guilt and. you're not you're not doing enough."
15158.0,Patient,"We seems not not doing enough, which is. interesting because, like I said, there are times when i'm like. i'm. doing too much as far as one person might be concerned like i'm in the mix too much or you know kind of creating now whether that's creating. negative things for them or they're just it's annoying or whatever, but it's really super i'm super funny in the sense of like oh i'm doing stuff that means you know, obviously i'm trying to do something good and."
226.0,Provider,yeah. So you can just be you know i'm just i'm just being something where we go.
15158.0,Patient,"yeah when i'm by myself. i'm. When i'm by myself or with an animal that's content just hanging. i'm good. Just like anyone, no one has any idea. What I did yesterday kind of thing like helping a person move in the rain packing them whatever, but it felt so good, last night I got here I got home, and it was like I took a bath. Walls like. You know. drink kind of thing like because it's been crappy and rainy and disgusting and it just like that felt great because I could look forward to like feeling like I was allowed. And it's so weird like. Why am I not doing Why am I not getting done things like that."
