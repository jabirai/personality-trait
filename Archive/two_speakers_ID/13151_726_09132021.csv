I wasn't dressed as I was working at this pizza place. yelling at me and. I just didn't like it, I couldn't handle and I woke up in tears I didn't want to go to work there, so. I could it be, for I had another job, but you know it's all right. i'm looking for another job and. You know, I was rushing rushing rushing trying to get everything done and I don't know what i'm in a big rush for so i'm just trying to take care of myself. and go slower, and you know because i'm very high strung so I go go go anyways but. yeah I feel like a chicken with her head cut off it's. Like i'm cheating but i'm not really tweaking you know. And I got a big abscess to my mouth up here and I have."

726.0,Provider,"yeah so how awesome How was the the place, you were at before you finish that program and now you're the."

726.0,Provider,I mean.
13151.0,Patient,"If I just take it easy and. And my teeth can. be okay, you know. i've been in a lot of pain, with my teeth and so like at matter of fact, I went to the emergency room this morning and they gave me a shot of some kind of non narcotic. The antibiotics, the dentist game, he wasn't working. yeah so Besides that, I think it'll be okay, when this is all over I just feel like a chicken with her head cut off, you know."
726.0,Provider,"yeah well, I think it sounds like you're worried about like just like things like work, and you know you have your health stuff with your teeth. But it sounds like I almost think like maybe it's a blessing in disguise, that the the thing with the job didn't work out because then you were able to take care of your arm like that Apps as you were talking about. And like maybe if you were at that job I don't know, maybe would have been a different situation."
13151.0,Patient,"yeah maybe that's what everyone keeps telling me that maybe God doesn't do anything by mistake, so you know there's a reason for everything so."
726.0,Provider,"yeah so what kind of jobs, you looking for now."
13151.0,Patient,"I want like I used to drive sleeper truck and I really want to do that again but they told me they were to hire me until I had six months clean. Clean or six months at another job because they don't want to hire me and I go i'll go back again because when they hired me they really liked me and they said they thought was going to be a guy that did everything and it was me. And then, when they had to let me go. they're going to bummed about it. So, as I but i'm so they do landscaping power washing and street sweeping and all kinds of stuff and I did all of it, so I really kind of want to go back there but i'm just trying to find another job to do. For you know. Until they hire me back and maybe I might like i've tried to let the mills, I just want to be busy I don't want to be sitting in an office i'm not that girl."
726.0,Provider,going to.

13151.0,Patient,"Easy yes, I do but it's actually I just found out, I have no rear drive line. drive and I just found out have no real drive line so i'm going to put it up for sale and try and go down this Auto auction and see if they'll do a trade in, or something it's it's a good little Honda pilot just I can't afford to fix all that stuff you know."
726.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah concert expensive to fix to.
13151.0,Patient,"Yes, they are. And I really liked the pilot, but you know. I don't know I just need to figure something out."
726.0,Provider,"Well i'm gonna i'm just looking branding on our last meeting there was something that I had to complete with you that I wasn't I didn't I didn't do it. Okay, I said Okay, if I ask you, those questions, so I can put them in the computer. Sure, and the other thing was going to just say everything else looks pretty good in your chart. The only thing is you're missing to surveys. and on virtual clinic arm."
13151.0,Patient,Is one the aces test.
726.0,Provider,No that one's good that one's green so you're going on.
13151.0,Patient,"So I guess I did do that one, but it went I kept acting like it wasn't going through, so I don't know."
726.0,Provider,"Oh alright know that one through that was good it's like up to date i'm actually i'll just do this afterwards after we do this, so if you want to take note of it, so when you do meet with virtual clinic you can call them and we'll send it to you and then it's just. A matter of just doing it through your email. um so branding these questions, because the the first appointment, we have was like gathering information for treatment and so these questions are like suicidality kind of questions so in my. Mind i'm like it's questions about whether you if you're actively thinking about hurting yourself. or something like that. So i'll just go quickly over them and go through it um have you wish, you were dead or wish you could go to sleep and wake up."
13151.0,Patient,"Before, yes, but now know."
726.0,Provider,"When you send me for how long would go with it, that have been."
13151.0,Patient,Whatever the 21 years ago.
726.0,Provider,Okay okay.
13151.0,Patient,"and actually before I got clean I just wished I would die every day I hated the way I felt. Okay, probably like six months ago."
726.0,Provider,yeah current suicidal thoughts have you actually have any thoughts of killing yourself.
13151.0,Patient,"Not recently, no."
726.0,Provider,"No, have you been thinking about how you might do this. No, no. Any plans or means of being able to do that, like in the past."
13151.0,Patient,I did take a bunch of pills before okay.

726.0,Provider,Who who do you. connect with all of their.
13151.0,Patient,"I have a counselor here actually have two counselors here my sponsor I have my family my mom and my daughter. I have a lot of supportive people in na that support me in anything I need or need to talk about or anything they're all here for me and I don't know if I told you this before, but, like last time before I figured if anything ever happened in my kids or my mom or something that. That I would I would get loaded you know, but I know now that I have enough support system and stuff that I wouldn't have to. Sorry there's somebody sitting over there, so I got up and started walking around I hope that's okay i'm not."
726.0,Provider,"No, no, no you're fine you're fine um are you doing any in person or the virtual."
13151.0,Patient,"Both i'm doing both. Mainly I go in person, mainly I did a couple online the other night."
726.0,Provider,When you find it more helpful to be in the in person ones.
13151.0,Patient,"And I can't think they're about the same because I got some real good support and some good stuff of other meeting I did the other night with these women online and. We just I like them both. When I was in rehab we did a lot of zoom and I didn't really give them too much, but now I think, maybe because I get to go to both that I like them, I don't know. The same person, one is better, you know, but I got a lot of support the other night when I was on the women's meeting online, so it was really good."
726.0,Provider,Anything that has been like coming up now that you are a little bit more independent from the prior program like that you weren't before how you feel now.
13151.0,Patient,"I feel good I. I. I get nervous sometimes because I don't want to do nothing stupid, but I haven't had the urge to use or anything like that I don't know what you mean is that what you're asking."
726.0,Provider,"yeah like um how you feel now, because I know that you were doing groups, and it was very structured environment and now that you're going back to work, and looking for work and doing that that may feel a little bit different than it."
13151.0,Patient,"yeah it feels. It feels a lot different because I was, I was going to groups 24 seven, and I feel kind of like. Oh, what do I do now, but i've been going and like working up at my house and making some extra money and working for friends and making some extra money and just taking to actually this last week I didn't really do anything I just took care of myself all weekend. I just laid around and took my medicine and took good care of myself."

726.0,Provider,Your sponsor did you meet them in person or did you meet them through virtual.
13151.0,Patient,"I met her in person, she was um I knew her before before I got loaded again. So now she's my sponsor she's good she calls me on my shit when I think that i'm. i'm I don't know when i'm thinking i'm doing okay or i'm bitching and she'll be like she's on now that's you."
726.0,Provider,"Well brandi what How would it be helpful if we scheduled like for future appointments if we scheduled on the same days and like similar times. Yes, Okay, because I think that, like for this program and braveheart. I meet with you twice a month, so what i've been doing with a lot of my people is that I scheduled to appointments ahead but they're always weeks apart and I try to make them on the same days in the same times. That will be great yeah so does it like does this time work for you."
