12007.0,Patient,hi Julie.
416.0,Provider,How are you.
12007.0,Patient,"i'm pretty good, how are you."
416.0,Provider,"i'm pretty good I my background is going to be a little loud today I have my son and his two brothers here, so if I call them the triplets and their nepal's so anyway. Sorry in advance for the child's. Christmas behind me but. they're kind of difficult to keep quiet. I have noticed. i'm kind of realizing why I don't have three kids all about same age. How was your holiday."
12007.0,Patient,It was good.
416.0,Provider,I did about it.
12007.0,Patient,"yeah it was real good we had. Oh, there were some. issues with you know getting a you know, up to the the party I had emailed everybody and told them, you know that they were invited for Christmas, and you know what we wasn't sure what everybody wanted to eat, so let me know, and let me know if you're coming and crickets."
416.0,Provider,I hate that.
12007.0,Patient,"I know so Gary finally told us sign, you know joe's been trying to figure out what groceries to get and how many people are coming and nobody's responding. And kind of the response was well you guys don't always. respond to us when we touched you either you know about some sweatshirt or something that's like oh my God. yeah so I find that I called him, his wife and I just told her that I kind of felt all alone, and you know, could she helped me out a little bit and. So they just you know they said their family was coming, and she said she'd be happy to make whatever I wanted, and you know what whatever tradition, we had in our family was just fine. You know, not to worry about it, but you know, we had done Mexican food for many, many Christmases and her son said. Oh, we need to stop doing Mexican and there must be something better, we can have for Christmas, and so the last year I did Italian so this year I did a pork roast and a Turkey breast and mashed potatoes and gravy and. and They really liked it they they thought it was wonderful and I just you know, I have to. I have to let go of being upset about anything like that, because they all have crazy lives, and you know it hasn't been easy for them. And it's been very easy for me and I enjoy cooking and you know it worked out fine. So. That worked out just fine. You know people get upset around the holidays about stuff and I have in my past too, and I just thought nope i'm not going to get upset about this it's not worth it. yeah."
416.0,Provider,Can you handle that stress really well in a way that you felt pretty proud of.
12007.0,Patient,yeah yeah absolutely.
416.0,Provider,Last time we talked to do about a little exposure therapy with your see pat mouse what was what's the update on that.
12007.0,Patient,Julia walk that forward to the next steps.
416.0,Provider,"Of course, you did you're."
12007.0,Patient,"Both back having to go back in that room and do another sleep study and the whole thing and i'm like no I just don't want to do it. I don't know how dangerous it is not to have that see Pat, but I just. i'm just not interested in buying it out of pocket and i'm not interested in going back to that horrible little sleep room again and I just. I don't want to do it, there must be another solution for me."
416.0,Provider,"To, then what is the plan are you going to go talk with your doctor, to see if there's other solutions."
12007.0,Patient,"Well, he wanted me to wait until it was done losing weight. Because he said he thought it was making a difference and he asked me if I was done and I said no, and you said well let's wait until you're done losing weight and then we'll you know we'll talk again I don't know what that means."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, that works so but it's not something you're just writing off you're just you're still kind of having a disc you're in conversation with your doctor about."
12007.0,Patient,solution yeah yeah. yeah i'd like to have a solution that's. That doesn't include sleeping overnight in that room.
416.0,Provider,"yeah fair enough. Right. So. What what's important for you to talk about today, where do we want to go with this."
12007.0,Patient,"But this is not important, but I do want to talk to you about this um. Is it what's your name from group. Linda. asked me if I if she could call me sometime and I said sure. And last night about eight o'clock I was watching the football game with Gary and she called and I picked up the phone and you know it's very kind and Nice and everything and. She started talking and not once did she stopped I mean it was like for 10 minutes, she was talking talking talking talking talking. And finally I just said, Linda can I interrupt you, for a minute, and she said sure, and I said, you know i'm not a i'm not really a phone kind of talker person I said I really care about you and I want you to know that. I care, but I really don't like talking on the phone during much, and I hope you don't feel offended by that, but I just I need to get off the phone. And she was nice about it, but she started crying at the end and I felt like shit. She said."
416.0,Provider,not really wow. What was she was she crying about do you know.
12007.0,Patient,"What she said it was the loss of her dog, but I have a feeling, it was because she her feelings were hurt because I didn't want to talk to her anymore."
416.0,Provider,yeah I think she's alone.
12007.0,Patient,she's what.
416.0,Provider,"I think she's pretty lonely. But that's not your responsibility, you know. it's it's not."
12007.0,Patient,"again and see if that I handled it Okay, because I, I felt kind of bad afterwards."
416.0,Provider,"You know I think you handled it perfectly, so I think it's important for her to get for all of us to get feedback right on things if we're not necessarily. Engaging well with others or we're not listening to their needs to it's important for us to get feedback on that right yeah. So I think you handled it in a very kind. In a very kind way, but like well boundary if that's a word, but I just made it one."
12007.0,Patient,I like that word.
416.0,Provider,yeah we're gonna just go with it right amen.
12007.0,Patient,Good I felt like.
416.0,Provider,They just don't come.
12007.0,Patient,"She had she had a lot of compliments for me in her in her diatribe and and it was it was very nice but I don't you know I don't need that I, you know I. I just I really truly don't like talking on the phone with anybody."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I don't love it either, especially when it's like kind of during time that I have with my family or you know. Like if i'm out on a walk or something maybe. But yeah if it's like my time with my husband or my kids or whatever, like, I want to be with my husband I don't want to be in the phone yeah. yeah Well, I do think you handled that really well."
12007.0,Patient,Good good that's important.
416.0,Provider,But it sounds like it didn't sell all of you.
12007.0,Patient,"Well, it it I just felt bad for her because I like like you say she is lonely I know shes lonely and you know she probably really needed to have to reach out to somebody but you know 10 minutes is way over my maps. it's just nuts. I."
416.0,Provider,mean we're. out like by the normal interaction the back and forth.
12007.0,Patient,Right right.
416.0,Provider,"yeah am. I mean okay so part of being in recovery rate or part of just getting healthy in our lives is also about putting down those boundaries and. And figuring out how to not be responsible for everybody else's stuff. And it's tempting when you're loving person it's also tempting when you're a person who would rather deal with somebody else's stuff than your own. you're in a different place now right where you are dealing with your own stuff and you are very focused on it in a very healthy way and that kind of distraction probably I can imagine doesn't feel healthy for you anymore. Right you're not. willing or able or. or attempted as much to take on at work, but a lot of people are to take on somebody else's stuff yeah."
12007.0,Patient,"I used to be, I. Not anymore."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm did what happened when you did it where you burnt out.
12007.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I would always feel worse after those kinds of conversations than I did before you know what I mean. so frequently conversations with people who are needy turn into gossip and I hate gossip I am horrid. And it's hurt so many people and, if I had engaged in it in my past or even listen to it, it would make me feel horrible. And I just don't want any part of it."
416.0,Provider,"Exactly it's toxic stuff right. there's this whole. This whole thing in dialectical behavioral therapy there's like whole sections of stuff on interpersonal relationships and part of that is about identifying. Identifying things that are not healthy right identifying toxic potentially toxic situations and actually let me pull it up for a second and he when it says, but I think that you sort of naturally and i'm not saying that linda's toxic but um. But sometimes those interactions are. hold on one second. Let me find. Too much stuff on my computer."
12007.0,Patient,"While you're looking, I just wanted to let you know she she told me that she was a little bit upset that when she when she was upset in our session last week that you didn't offer her a session and my response to that was well, did you ask her for a session."
416.0,Provider,and
12007.0,Patient,"He said, well, no. And I said well. That would be the thing that I would recommend, then, is that you should ask for something you need."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, here we go. So there's this whole section about ending destructive and interfering relationships. and identifying them. i'm just looking to see if there's any like gems in here, but I think you just handled it so lovely anyway. See if there's anything else in here. yeah no I think it's all stuff thanks Marty kinda kind of redeeming."
12007.0,Patient,Good.
416.0,Provider,destructive relationship as the quality of destroying are completely spoiling yeah. yeah. you've got this covered.
12007.0,Patient,"I know I mean when I was in my early 20s I was gossipy and I took on people's stuff and I pushed my stuff on other people, and I mean I was just not in a good place and, over time, you know, mostly through trial and error, but some therapy I learned to distance myself from gossiping and. To. Not you know, to put some boundaries up and and to you know be healthy in my relationships and the only time i've fallen back on that is when I when I relapse you know, and then I start getting into it a little bit you know feeling icky stuff."
416.0,Provider,"it's funny heather I mean not funny but interesting and really clear how like when we relapse on drugs or alcohol. We relapse in our behaviors to right it's it all goes together, I mean we see we you, I know that you know the term like dry drunk or whatever it else right but true recoveries recovery from all of it and. And the change in thinking, the change and behaving that's the stuff that keeps us propelling in healthy ways like propelling forward so i'm. So yeah makes sense that you know when things start to kind of go bad behavior rolling that's when you start to notice more cravings more drawn to alcohol. And that's an interesting idea for you, because I introduced you to the relapse prevention plan couple weeks ago. And I don't know if you did it, but one of the things that could be on there is to look at like what are some of the first the early signs. that things are not going well for you right some of the early sort of triggers. And for you some of that might be you start getting involved in gossip you start connecting with people that are less healthy right some of those sort of behavioral things usually come before the actual relapse we start to say. That yep. So the nice thing about actually writing that down is you can actually share with the people that are closest to you can share it with Gary you can share it with whoever right."
12007.0,Patient,you're close.
416.0,Provider,"To the border and say like when you see this, this is how I want you to intervene, I want you to say this to me or whatever. And this will be my claim, and then you can come to some agreement about how he steps in in ways that aren't going to be, you know cause big fights or whatever."
12007.0,Patient,"Another thing I was really proud of myself of this a little off topic, but I was very proud that on Christmas just before all the company came, I said to Gary he said Well he first asked me how can I help you. And I told him that he he could watch for people not helping or not participating, or you know. anything like that, where he could kind of oversee that group and encourage you know once go help Joe cook or why don't you why don't you help do dishes or or. You know, do you guys want to play a game, you know that kind of stuff he did a really good job of it we, I mean we really were partners in the whole. thing so that. his son and his daughter's boyfriend did the dishes afterwards, and it was a ton of dishes. All you know and people were putting food away, and I mean it was it was really good how it, how it worked and, and the reason it came up. In this conversation is that healthy interchange you know it was really, really good for both Gary and I have in you know we both noticed how good it made us feel you know. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"It doesn't feel good to have your partner your partner and it feels even better, to be able to speak up. it's exactly like what you suggested for Linda to right if you need something. there's ways to do that yep."
12007.0,Patient,"perfect. A long ways to go, but it just feels good to be on this side of health, you know."
416.0,Provider,"that's right it's so good, I love it. i'm. gonna ask you, I had that. As I can't hear notes from last time. We talked last time about wise mind going into the holidays, making sure that you know you have take care of your basic needs for Australia like you need a healthy meal go exercise having a safe room with Gary but it sounds like you kind of handled all that."
12007.0,Patient,I did it did it worked really well yeah I talked to my sponsor before. Before the party and stuff to about. letting go of the issues you know. letting go of the problem parts and. That worked really good to. we're going to have a new year's Eve party frightened Gary and I are going to pick up my sponsor and go to the a new year's Eve party together.
416.0,Provider,Oh Nice. fun very fun. Very cool um. I was looking at your. Your kind of long term patient goals that we have in your treatment plan. And we have like managing anxiety symptoms find forgiveness. For yourself around mistakes you've made as a parent or experiences that you've had as a woman. communicate you're wanting the needs clearly have a voice right and then develop a really long and not a really long a strong relapse prevention plan. And as i'm looking at these calls and like how she's doing a lot of us. i'm also wondering if you have any additional goals there.
12007.0,Patient,"hmm. I think that you know i'm in the. Almost a pink cloud phase, you know, since i've been losing weight and everything. And I think my biggest. worry and Gary brought this up this morning is when I get to my goal weight and. stuff not to go the other way, both with. My behavior and with with gaining weight again right."
416.0,Provider,So you know that's.
12007.0,Patient,Is the maintenance stuff.
416.0,Provider,yep.
12007.0,Patient,And not just with weight and you know with everything.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
12007.0,Patient,"Absolutely fighting anymore. what's my motivation for. Continuing to be healthy, you know."
416.0,Provider,"So there's a lot about trusting yourself that i'm hearing in there as like. You know you've kind of learned, not to trust yourself with this stuff and you're piece by piece getting it back. But i'm wondering. Just what comes to your mind when I say when I asked you like, how long do you need to see all of this working before you feel like you're going to trust yourself that it will keep working."
12007.0,Patient,alone time.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
12007.0,Patient,"yeah because i've done this over and over again, you know, this is not the first rodeo. Probably the the most stable than i've ever been. Great and you know i'm the most active and a and bright heart. than i've ever been. With anything. But I. I have a tendency to become complacent and go back to my old behaviors and I. don't happen."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so definitely if we were going to add something to your treatment plan, it would be to see these changes maintained over time and through challenges. so that you could build back the trust that you have in yourself yeah okay. yeah and that's just that's going to take time and consistency and continue showing up for yourself. I think we can do that."
12007.0,Patient,cool. me being involved in the Program.
416.0,Provider,"Well that's what i'm trying to figure out. And I mean it's not totally just up to me it's up to you to I mean i'm nobody's kicking you out right which typically happens with my patients who have met their treatment goals. Is we switch them to like kind of more of a maintenance phase where I would see you less often and you would go to group less often to maybe go to group, like. Twice a month."
12007.0,Patient,I think we already decided that.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and then eventually once a month and then eventually quarterly you'd have met check ins and same thing with your sessions with me Ray would just kind of keep dropping you down. With the option always if something happened to be things up again i've done this with plenty of other patients. Where they have like they really are feeling great and then they kind of we slowly, you know have them be on their own and then life throws a curveball they come back in for a little bit and then they're back out right so. we've definitely had. we've seen a mix of all of that and it's it's fine right and that's addiction. And it's also mental health stuff right it's complicated and it comes and goes and. stuff comes up and whatever so there's the that's very long way to say that, like we're not going anywhere and. You know, even if your treatment goal is maintenance of the current plan on, then you know we can kind of just do maintenance thing."
12007.0,Patient,Good good.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so we'll keep talking about it and that's The other reason why we do these surveys to is to just kind of like keep checking in on where you are and I haven't looked at your surveys recently, but let me look at him real quick. You are can you hear those kids in the background. Barely okay good. they're being pretty quiet right now but they're really not quiet children. Fine."
12007.0,Patient,I wasn't bothering me. Absolutely no.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good, and I think i've shown you this oh yeah see this looks really good, let me share my screen with you. I think i've shown you this before, but it's always nice to see it again. i've shown you your survey results before whoops that's not what I meant. No, no, cancel. This and share. i've shown you your survey results before right Joe."
12007.0,Patient,yeah it was before.
416.0,Provider,"So yeah this is your anxiety scores, and you had all the time, a little dip a little climb back up to eight and then you've had a nice steady decline since about August. And you've been consistently Nice and low like in the minimal anxiety level stuff down here. And some weeks, you didn't even register, since what September, the end of September and really pretty much the same thing with your depression scores, so you started out pretty high. And then you've had this really nice decrease it's exactly what we want to see, and you would be considered, probably for the most part subclinical in terms of depression. And if this keeps going subclinical and anxiety to. So that's great, this is what we want to see right, and these are normal, by the way, like these little bumps but. Wait we just don't want to see Spikes like way off the stratosphere, but these little This is like oh life came up that week, and it was a little challenging and maybe I didn't sleep that well and whatever and then. Okay, and then it came right back down so you know these like little bumps are really normal. Great but they're maintaining you know they're maintaining down here they're not shooting up into any place crazy so yeah I mean this is if we see continue to see this consistently, I think we certainly can talk about. You know even less frequent and then that'll be good, because if you're if our goal for you is one of our goals is to. kind of test the skills that you have see how you're doing and start learning to trust yourself without like really frequent sessions with me and frequent individual session or group sessions. And then we can kind of slowly get there and that'll be part of earning you know you earning that trust back and building that trust back in yourself right and don't need quite as much support to keep this going yeah. But it will always be here in the background right we've gotcha. Good that you can test it out. And we'll just see. yeah and there's no reason for us to you know rush forward into anything we can just kind of go."
12007.0,Patient,like it.
416.0,Provider,yeah I like it you. Know there's no rush no need to push things we'll just keep talking about it and see what comes up and. move through it at at the pace that feels right.
12007.0,Patient,like it.
416.0,Provider,"Good I like to it's kind of Nice. So. i'm just being able to kind of make it through the holidays and such a nice way as it's a real good sign night I hope you see that you know, hopefully, that built a little trust back in yourself because holidays lot of people aren't doing that great. And here you are, you did you know you did really well."
12007.0,Patient,I did. And I did the pound I can't believe that I lost weight over Christmas.
416.0,Provider,You did. amazing.
12007.0,Patient,And I didn't deprive myself of anything I wanted.
416.0,Provider,"I think you've just kind of found your equilibrium, it seems like. yeah right there isn't a lot of like this goes back to the behavioral indicators of problems there isn't a lot of like oh i'm i'm i'm reaching for something outside of myself to make myself feel better."
12007.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"There isn't a lot of that it's like no i'm doing the things that make me feel good and standing up for myself, I have boundaries, I have communication, I have a good relationship right like i'm forgiving myself all of those things there's nothing to stop after."
12007.0,Patient,"You know, in the past when i've dieted dieted I have. made a big deal out of it and i've gotten on weight watchers or I had weight loss surgery or I had some big thing I for a while I took some diet pills from with a doctor and. You know, lost weight and every single time it's been like a program or a big thing. And this time it just wasn't normal eating I just ate less and I didn't it didn't make a big deal out of it and it wasn't a diet it hasn't been a diet. And you know when I started walking wasn't like okay i'm going to start my exercise program I just Oh, I think i'll take a walk with the dog oh that felt good let's do that again, you know now it's every day. And you know it's just kind of it, because it was so natural it feels like it could be more permanent you know, like it. it's just part of my life and i'm not making a big deal out of anything it's just. Daily choices."
416.0,Provider,"Well, and that's so much along the theme of trusting yourself you're not only listening now and tuning in. to your body listening to your you know your satiety signals right your brain your body saying i'm not hungry anymore. So eating less right it's not a restriction it's just i'm tuning in and then also like oh that felt good when I went for a walk let's do that again like you said right that's listening to yourself and learning to trust yourself. yeah that's tuning in and your body will find if you continue to do that your body will find the weight that it feels right on. And it will just maintain it there."
12007.0,Patient,"yeah I said, I said that to Gary this morning I said, you know I don't think. I have to do any big thing to get on to maintenance when i'm there I said, you know my body will just stop losing weight at some set point and that's fine."
416.0,Provider,"yeah and it'll be up. Your body will be like okay this sounds this feels good i'm gonna stick here. that's great. that's great and because you're not depriving it yourself, it will happen, naturally, but if you were if you were going like way under your normal caloric intake That would be a whole different thing. amazing work Jeff."
12007.0,Patient,Thank you.
416.0,Provider,you're doing a lot of really good stuff. it's basically so much of it is just keep doing what you're doing.
12007.0,Patient,"yeah it's funny I I used to dread any kind of exercise, and now I can't wait to go on my walks with Stella."
416.0,Provider,it's all I mean who wouldn't want to hang out with.
12007.0,Patient,"Stalin, I know she's a cutie pie."
416.0,Provider,Is such a cutie pie. she's a good girl. she's the best other than what you're the best boy and she's the best girl yes.
