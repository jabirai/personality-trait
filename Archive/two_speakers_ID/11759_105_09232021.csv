ID,Role,Message
105.0,Provider,hey. Good morning. You want to show off your bird.
11759.0,Patient,yeah he's gonna leave him in here with us this morning he may make some noise.
105.0,Provider,Okay sounds good man.
11759.0,Patient,"he's a little rescue birdie he was taken away from his mother too soon, in a pet store. was attacked by a bigger bird. me last two toes and he was bitten right in front of his nostrils cracked his Beak severely but he's even grown, except for one toenail hasn't it's just a little white nail now. toes actually grew back, he was so young. and his Beak is completely the crack just slowly grew down until it was gone here buddy you can go to your cage go on."
105.0,Provider,There you go.
11759.0,Patient,he's an amazing little bird oh. So smart you give him dried bananas and his food go put them in as water dish to so come up and then eat him. yeah he poops on command.
105.0,Provider,Which i've.
11759.0,Patient,asked him to poop before you take him on your shoulder and. He does all kinds of things you can reach him to get him out of his cage and you'll get on your finger and right all the way out.
105.0,Provider,That took.
11759.0,Patient,I don't teach him tricks I just thought in five or six little convenient for living with him things you know. You may make some noise in here today he thinks we're talking to him if we're.
105.0,Provider,"Never it's never been disrupted in the past. it's really about your ability to hear it, and then come back and just sort of not. Let your focus drift too far into thinking or having to explain to me it's really you being able to hear it, and then come back to whatever it is that we're focusing on."
11759.0,Patient,Oh that's one great gift the navy gave me I can tune anything out.
105.0,Provider,"Okay right, so I didn't notice that we had the gun something and I don't know if you're up to it today, but I wanted to invite you. You started an activity that oftentimes takes you know, two could take one session three sessions we had started developing an ECHO room or a resource room safe place it goes by a lot of different names. We hit we are definitely not done with it we had identified really key pieces but there's a lot more to do. Are you interested in doing a little bit more sort of it'll be emotionally probably provoking a little bit of that but that's kind of what therapy is much like physical therapy it's not all together comfortable with that be okay."
11759.0,Patient,yeah I a. Little scared.
105.0,Provider,You can always say i'm scared.
11759.0,Patient,I looked into. Was it Robert Schwartz.
105.0,Provider,Richard.
11759.0,Patient,"Richard swartz okay and. You know, and I got through this is what are they eight CDs, or something like that. For the walker's thing and see how that works and all and I got into the part about protectors and. Oh, is it. naughty victor's. exile yet exiles okay yeah the protectors in the exiles and about how they're like some of the I guess the X files can like be based on our. Childhood traumas and they kind of exist as like a child inside us that's been hurt. exiles them away so that they don't. hurt us as adults and."
105.0,Provider,overwhelm the system yeah.
11759.0,Patient,"You know. And I yeah he's very big on the system, and when I am too i'm you know gosh with my background of course systems are important to. me i'm in everything."
105.0,Provider,So this might be a compatible approach and it's certainly one that I work with all day long.
11759.0,Patient,It scares me that. There could be these facets of me that I don't even know that can have such a huge impact. On my. Self.
105.0,Provider,"So stay there don't go any further than that. Once you to listen to what you said it scares me to think that there are facets of myself that have influence on the self. What is the fear, what is the real fear."
11759.0,Patient,Maybe the unknown. Maybe they'll find out some I. don't want to find out.
105.0,Provider,"You know okay that's that's it so stay there. It might help for me to reassure you again and we don't always if you're reading and watching YouTube or wherever you are getting your information, it isn't always clear that all the parts are welcome here there is not one part. That is not on your side that you heal that you be okay. it's approach. Like drugs, alcohol suicide gambling excessive behavior in certain things. don't have significant fallout, and in fact some of those parts they're called firefighter parts, the ones that are these very dramatic sweeping behaviors. They leave carnage but their intent is that you're okay every single thing about you and when we're saying you see use the word aspect, so in this one it's heavily it's part there is no part about you. That you will find out is evil bad or wrong, not one every single thing about you, is on your side, you will not be this. I don't write you don't have to it's safe they're all welcome you won't you'll never hear from me that one's we've got to get rid of that one and i've come to learn and it's a new thing for me even shame, which in my view, I would say, more than 20 years. I always thought shame is one of the BAT it was the only one, I everything else was fine and now with this approach, even shame. is welcome and that's very different so i've had some growth around this too, so when you say i'm afraid i'm gonna find something out well i'm assuming you're not going to find something out that's fantastic. you're afraid you'll find out something that's bad most people think good bad. nope. they're all welcome."
11759.0,Patient,you're evil.
105.0,Provider,"Not a single. Nothing nothing, and it is wild for people, because most of. psycho analysis and so many things they all say that that eventually we're going to find out this this other part this other aspect of our mind that we want to eradicate that doesn't belong, and that you know, is something to be gotten rid of. Know that's what's so neat about this particular approach all parts are welcome and i'm good in. Making sure they feel that way you'll still have your reactions of fear you'll be afraid what's going to happen. But i'm here to continue to guide and remind along the way, and i'll probably pick up on the fear response. to remind you. That that part does not need to be afraid that we're going to make it go away."
11759.0,Patient,What about somebody like Charles manson you go he wouldn't have an evil aspect.
105.0,Provider,"So we could spend, though, we could talk about Hitler, we can talk about a lot of."
11759.0,Patient,People here.
105.0,Provider,"So this could be a philosophical Socratic dialogue, but I don't know that that will help us get this anchor room done."
11759.0,Patient,"anything like that me show. You more. Intellectual curiosity than anything, so we can go on."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, it would just consume the whole hour. So i'm going to give you my short answer though and you're not going to like it. yep even that part I know if you were here in front of me. He would be safe, with me. i'd be glad that he's on telemedicine. Number one number two. is going to be me still wanting to get to know that dramatic the same way, suicide is killing you homicide is still a dramatic solution it's a protector, I know it's a while departure from the way, most people think about our behavior."
11759.0,Patient,or don't have any fruit cycle and.
105.0,Provider,"So. let's back away because we will spend, we could spend the whole time philosophizing about that approach. But there's some. problems that come when too much information is shared about, and you can investigate do all the learning one about it it's very different than doing an experiential exercise where there's enough trust around the guide versus analyzing the machine itself. Right it's different to ride in the machine than to deconstruct it and take it apart and understand it philosophically versus having gotten in the machine."
11759.0,Patient,Right got it.
105.0,Provider,So when i'm inviting is an experiential understanding of it and you on your own as you already did trying to understand the mechanics of it and deconstruct it and we can maybe another time it can get a little bit more into it.
11759.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"So. let's go, this is not. This anchor room comes from somewhere else it actually comes from somatic experiencing but it doesn't come from this model, but it shares so many common elements of it. you're welcome to be thinking in parts language that's fine, but this really isn't coming from that that theoretical approach. Right OK OK so i'm going to share with you it's only three lines it's not a lot of information, it was powerful and very meaningful way you shared but i'm going to try to bring you back to where you were in this. anchor room. As much as you can john to the degree that it feels comfortable for you and you may do it on your timing. It would be helpful if you were allowing yourself to go into the right brain, which is where creativity and imagination gets generated. It and maybe taking in less data from your eyes might be helpful to you may want to consider closing your eyes i'm going to be meetings my eyes, going to be down here i'm not gonna be staring at you. This will give you a chance to if you can immerse yourself back into this imagery that you shared. So."
11759.0,Patient,Good.
105.0,Provider,"You had shared. Some time ago, a feeling of sad. You described a room that was added on to this residence that you are in now. it's light blue dry. dry wall in color there was an aluminum plate glass. Something left to right a gun rack to 22 rifles one mind with the scope and target rifle there was an aquarium. Small desk. And as you get more and more there you go good good good. Small desk in bed no dresser. An old wind up clock. Pictures of airplanes. And I had invited you to pay attention to the tactile experience about space. And there was the sense of you were building something with wood. You were feeling for something smooth. In the sanding. And then you became aware of a scent. The smell of sanding sealer. There was no awareness of taste, but, of course, if that comes up, we can always change an ad and amend this room, as it changes. invited you to think about in this room in this anchor room this resource room that will have all. of everything that you need. You didn't hear anything in that space. The temperature was described as comfortable. And then, looking at the door you notice was of a darker grain of wood. poly core wouldn't core standard. goal knob. For the hardware. A narrow two foot wide door and eight inches six and a half feet tall. Is a lock there does not provide security, I see you can unlock from the outside. not truly lockable. Things look like a keyhole. door is open about a foot wide. The emotion you experienced in that room was described as content and. And then you were asked a question, you may not have been asked before which was what was the misinformation. at that age back at this earlier age of when you experienced that earliest experience of sad. The misinformation that you had to believe in order to survive in your life at that time was that physical abuse is okay. And when you had that. presence in your awareness your heart began pounding. Then you were asked well. What help is needed. needed to get bigger. I want to continue this process. As lots of invitation on my side. And so we've got a lot to do. And that is I want you to also have the awareness that this is the room that you have everything that you need that that younger self. may not have had. But we want to get that in there and so just in the little bits that I did share was there any change that needed oh now there's this on the wall or there's this furniture in the room, or is there anything you notice boy this isn't quite right now I want this in there."
11759.0,Patient,No accurate.
105.0,Provider,"I heard, yes, I want to make sure you're not going to memory I got to make sure you're not going to men on your."
11759.0,Patient,"You know, tell you I guess I don't know if you would call it a change to the room, but. When you mentioned the thing about getting bigger yeah I was. kinda like I don't know hurting isn't the right word, but I was. I guess experiencing that. feeling of. You know I guess it's fear. And I. Just came out of me I don't know where it came from, but it was just like well I am bigger now I don't have to fear that. And more. And then I. know, of course, the next step is forgiveness from my dad and just he didn't know any better he you know, he was doing the best he could. well."
105.0,Provider,"This activity. is not like other. it's going to feel constrained by my next invitation it's going to feel constrained. let's see if we can stay. In this exercise and it'll feel a little weird, for example, I interrupted you that doesn't normally make sense, normally, you would want to be listened to. But I may or may not have mentioned that what's really important about this exercise. there's only three. questions that are memory oriented. One of them is the age of the earliest recollection of that same sadness and I didn't actually write it down, so I don't know what that was but i'm just going to go over the three. hey how old were you, which I may have dropped the ball and didn't ask. Number two. Is what was the misinformation. and Number three. Honestly, I can't even think what it is there's so little in this activity that is memory based but notice what you shared just now, was very heavily memory. it's a different kind of activity. And it might feel kind of. weird and awkward but do your very best to just answer. and be done and then up will come another invitation for something else to do."
11759.0,Patient,"What needs to be added, but not. go into what it is."
105.0,Provider,"So right, so I heard. Actually, I heard, I heard no I don't need to add anything to the room, and I was done, I had my answer. But what you wanted to. share this is clarifying something. You wanted to clarify what you did and explain and that's fantastic it just doesn't it will interrupt notice how much time is going in right now to having your way out of it we're now lost because you're not picturing be in that room we're gone we're."
11759.0,Patient,we're way out and again.
105.0,Provider,"You go, you have a very strong. analyst part of you that now we're dipping into that family systems model we were talking about earlier, you have very strong parts of you that are. jumping in and need to tell their story. So maybe to start with we'll start with if you could ask that part. of you, I don't know what we're going to name it. But maybe ask that part if it's willing to trust you or me or both of us just for. A half hour. To do an experiment that we neither one of us know what the outcome is going to be, I know how to make it happen, I know how to take care of you, I know how to create safety. What the outcome is neither of us know there will be unknown, can you ask that part that wants to tell the story and already sort of that intelligent."
11759.0,Patient,analytical.
105.0,Provider,Work Can you see.
11759.0,Patient,"Are we was trying to tell a story what I. wanted to say is, in my mind I added to that room and I don't think I could take it out now is this element of bigger that in my mind it just added to that room. it's like it back right now i'm going to remember. That i'm bigger than my dad you know I mean that's either."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
11759.0,Patient,So here's.
105.0,Provider,"It was there. It I said. what's written typed in front of me is the word help. dash get bigger what I said was and then you are asked and we're out of it, by the way, we're this activity is now not happening now we're because you've offered another explanation, so this is. I can't i'm not able to die right now it's not working, but I want to i'm going to do my best to try and explain. Bigger has been here for months since the first time, you told me it's been in the room. I said what would help. With the heart pounding and what would help in this belief that you had to believe in that physical abuse Okay, and you told me, you said. get bigger and I wrote it down. And you needed to tell me again oh yeah."
11759.0,Patient,"Well, probably because that's what ultimately ended it, you know."
105.0,Provider,"This activity is something else. And so that intellectual part told me another story, this is a very different way of interacting. Or it doesn't match the normal reciprocity that goes with I share a story someone listens they share a story someone listens it's not like that it is over, on the other side of your brain, it is on the right side, where you allow. Creativity not memory. And there are parts of you that may not trust that everything's going to be okay and keep interrupting they keep needing to explain explain explain, I need this lady to really get it. But."
11759.0,Patient,For me about what needed to be added.
105.0,Provider,"that's because this is very, very weird this way this exercise is this might help i'm looking for clothes ended, yes, know. If you had say yes, I will, yes, yes there's something I want to add, I would say, what is it and you might say. My dad's there, or you might say, i'm standing there with my shoulders up hi i'd like Okay, I will write that down but that's it. When you explaining why will interrupt him throw this whole thing off. OK OK."
11759.0,Patient,I will do it. The other thing you need to my age was probably about a.
105.0,Provider,"Fantastic, thank you for that I don't know how I missed it that's one of the memory questions there's only a couple everything else, and so this is probably going to come up again for you. you're going to be tempted again to want to explain it is a style your, it is a style of yours so you'll manage that, or you might catch it and say well i'm really tempted to want to share that or i'm starting or you might catch it as you're just starting."
11759.0,Patient,we're doing.
105.0,Provider,"To gently bring you back it's all welcome it's all welcome here i'm just one of these people that wants to stick with the fidelity of a model as best I can so that we can see if it's effective. we're going back. glasses are off we're going to the right frame and we're going to remember that this is about the creative mind. Which is scary sometimes because you don't know what's going to come up by everything as well okay there's not going to be anything ugly it's not going to be ugliness. Good so we have some clarification, now we really have this sense of being in this room where it's quiet temperature is comfortable there's no real taste. kind of summon up the awareness of that sealers smell again. And that tactile experience of you know kind of looking for that smooth when you're standing you know you'd like feeling feeling for smooth now are there bumps. And i'd like you to become aware, now that in this room there's. This magic and i'll come up with a structure for it, but if something comes up just say no mine is over here, and you just tell me where it is not why it's there. But where it is so if you can picture there's a magic wand and there's a like an almost invisible compartment in the side of the wall that when you press on it. sort of opens up and you can reach for that magic wand if that imagery doesn't work for you, you tell me where that magic it's."
11759.0,Patient,Like the one idea for some reason but. intestine. Have a bunch of stuff part power and inner power.
105.0,Provider,In our powers got it.
11759.0,Patient,Energy maybe just energy in there.
105.0,Provider,"Inside of you. So it's an energy. So. i'd like you to notice how your body feels right now, as you became aware of this magic energy that gets to exist in this room and it's inside of you, what do you notice about your body as that awareness might be a kind of a new thought new awareness, what did you notice in your physiology."
11759.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh. Like bigger."
105.0,Provider,yeah got bigger yet okay fantastic. So staying there. Looking around the room and noticing the aquarium. sent the light blue color wall. notice the emotion that you feel in this room. and share with me once you notice what it is.
11759.0,Patient,i'll be happy.
105.0,Provider,"If there were someone. That this eight year old could have gone to for help. The truth. Physical abuse is not Okay, or some other version, the truth. Who could have helped this little boy with the misinformation he had to live with at age eight who could have helped try to give me that first response that comes up."
11759.0,Patient,me now.
105.0,Provider,"There we go perfect, so we have the adult are we 65."
11759.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so stay there, so notice notice, if you can. That this eight year old like you to really look at this eight year old there in that room. And how does he look to you. As you see him there."
11759.0,Patient,whoa it's totally inaccurate.
105.0,Provider,"Member, this is imagination. there's no such thing, this is the creative mind you're going left i'm asking you to go right give me what you got."
11759.0,Patient,For kid.
105.0,Provider,Poor kid there you go. How do you feel toward him.
11759.0,Patient,"feel sorry for him, but also proud of him."
105.0,Provider,yeah okay.
11759.0,Patient,don't know he's gonna be okay.
105.0,Provider,For a moment i'd like you to embody. The experience that you were doing for which was being this eight year old in that room. be the eight year old for a moment this takes the creativity part. Again with the being able to look at the aquarium. The airplanes. Or that little mind went the airplanes building something with word. feeling smooth percent. comfortable temperature. The door. How do you feel as the eight year old.
11759.0,Patient,"This is, I don't know why. I have forgiven my dad but, as the eight year old I want a smacking."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, good stay there, stay there with that. I want to smack my dad be present with how that feels in your body."
11759.0,Patient,"No more energy than what is used against me, of course."
105.0,Provider,stay with the body. I want to smack my dad is a thought. what's that feel like to have that thought right now what's your body doing.
11759.0,Patient,Wrong i'm not gonna do it.
105.0,Provider,that's a thought.
11759.0,Patient,i'm not going to do it. And that's what really happened one day.
105.0,Provider,Sir memories. Those are memories. yeah i'm back to your body and feel if there is any constriction in your body anything happening in your physiology right now.
11759.0,Patient,yeah my throat fills. my throat is. Probably in my upper chest.
105.0,Provider,what's happening. what's happening in the upper chest. You can use. imagery you can say oh it's this color is the size it's moving what's it doing in that upper channels. restriction constriction.
11759.0,Patient,bright orange.
105.0,Provider,"orange excellent. Is that right or. bright orange constricted chest, and I know this is the creative mind."
11759.0,Patient,Are you.
105.0,Provider,"it's inside inside. you're doing amazing right now hang in there. You can't write orange inner constriction. could speak shout speak when it couldn't before what does it say don't overthink it, what does it have to say."
11759.0,Patient,I can do that.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah I can do this. Again, I know you shared with me earlier notice again. Getting in touch really and truly with a color with the vibration of that inner chest construction bright orange."
11759.0,Patient,There is a vibration.
105.0,Provider,"Okay describe it, if you can. empower yeah okay. and stay here stay here close you're doing great doing great come back come back lots of guidance coming your way. Lots coming your way stay there. Okay everything's okay."
11759.0,Patient,Trying to bust out.
105.0,Provider,"There you go. Trying to bust out perfect now. In the nation what. would most help. That bust out. What is needed, what did that boy, what did you. And what you need that you didn't get. Give yourself permission."
11759.0,Patient,"I would like to have the knowledge, I have right now."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so. let's have this little boy. bring this adult self. Close by as closest. Little man is comfortable i'm going to call them little man, unless the Defense you I can call him by a nickname. Whatever works, did you have a nickname."
11759.0,Patient,or everybody called me Johnny.
105.0,Provider,"Okay i'm going to call it Johnny that's great so it's going to be Johnny so I want you to be present in being Johnny. To the degree that Johnny is comfortable i'd like you to have. john 65 year old john available for Johnny and then describe where he shows up is it in the room outside the door on another planet, whereas john."
11759.0,Patient,would be in the room. problem we should run the bed.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, great. And where's Johnny john's on the bed."
11759.0,Patient,The bed.
105.0,Provider,Okay fantastic. arm around him. you're beautiful i'm around so now staying present with Johnny being embodying him feel that constriction that bright and you can change position get yourself comfortable. Do you want to you could slip over late lay all the way down.
11759.0,Patient,Leila sorry. i'm fine i'm just rub it out.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, good. So as much as you're comfortable coming back to wanting help. Getting. john. there. And now I want you to. Ask john. What you want to know. You have been stuck with this misinformation that physical abuse is okay i'd like you, is Johnny to turn towards john. Tell him something asked him something and i'd like to know what that is."
11759.0,Patient,"Well, I would have asked how do I make it stop. stay there, stay there."
105.0,Provider,How can I make it stop.
11759.0,Patient,What would I do to cause it to happen or you know.
105.0,Provider,"Well there's. Two different questions i'll do my best to write them down, how can I make. It stop can we do one, at a time so let's just take a moment i'd like you to feel what that's like. To turn to this adult."
11759.0,Patient,Self.
105.0,Provider,"How can I make it stop. Do you trust, are you looking at adult john can you look them in the eye."
11759.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you are able to make eye contact great oh. What does john say back to you."
11759.0,Patient,"you're not gonna be able to make it stop for a long time, but it will stop."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
11759.0,Patient,Putting a pin in that.
105.0,Provider,"Putting a pin, and the reason is, this is not memory come back we're doing something very special. Okay, so go back again. Once you look at his face when you said that. he's only eat. What happened to him, is he looking at you anymore."
11759.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"ask him how he feels when you told him basically it's going to keep going for some time, look at his reaction, how to see respond about."
11759.0,Patient,yeah I knew that.
105.0,Provider,I asked him how he feels.
11759.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,You accept that answer. From this eight year old teeth ain't. What can.
11759.0,Patient,I do.
105.0,Provider,So. As this eight year old. share with john. how you feel.
11759.0,Patient,don't worry i'll get through.
105.0,Provider,we're going to do it again I want you to be eight years old.
11759.0,Patient,I would be a girl telling him.
105.0,Provider,"I know I. mean I know you, I know I know I heard you. Say stay there. That was lovely of you to take care of the adult not. Not burden this adult and want you to be in this feeling of constriction in the throat again. orange. vibrating and wanting out wants to bust out should you do your best to not have to take care of john in this room that's why it is an anchor room is a special place. Where all of your needs get met. All of them don't take care of other people. We get our needs met. Look at john and tell him. Why you decided. to thank him, instead of asking something from him or telling him what you need."
11759.0,Patient,"Well, he gave me the truth. You know. and that's helpful information, I mean. I would, I would have been thankful to. have somebody to talk to you like that shape, you know just tell me the truth."
105.0,Provider,me in the absence of thankful we're going to go in again this is. Where you're going to reach inside for the magic. I get exactly what I want in here to to turn to john adult 65 year old john and tell him what you actually need. And don't overthink.

105.0,Provider,"Foreign not a lot of comment on the activity itself, but some awareness of. Getting in touch with sad. Again, and then some explanation, the part of you that explains things was very present right here at the end. This activity not quite done i'm going to think about whether it's relevant to go all the way through it, I do think this word responsibility. If there's there's a particular behavior that happens when I know this is done and it hasn't happened yet. So i'm looking for that. And I think the key word here is responsibility, so it all depends on how you feel when we see each other next time it's always Okay, for you to say nope not up for it or work through any available instance, you might have. A lot of time we're probably i'm assuming you want to eat in two weeks.

Now it's different it's. hey angry port wonder why you got to. communicate to me right now, what are you afraid I can't have a way out to be angry it's a completely different way to interact with our internal world. And it can feel a little unsettling. But for the rest of your life, it means you're not a victim to these thoughts memories. Emotions that come along, we have a way. to navigate that we didn't know before."
