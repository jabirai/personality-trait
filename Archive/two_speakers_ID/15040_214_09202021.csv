Okay, so she started on this so maybe about end of August and she's actually been going to school, she goes to school part time full time and then she works. She had to school started, maybe about August 16 things started, and she hadn't very sleepy she's been up she goes to get up does her work goes to work constantly and then and during class work or homework. On night and she was hardly sleeping. She was using the thc those eight pins and this happened, the 30th of August, she must have used to I don't know she used more but slowly she started going downhill from there, so she started First it was. Just blabbering about stuff not really making any sense. Like I said it started on Day and it was she was kind of okay I favorite or maybe she's just using she's smoking too much they started going for the following days open to like maybe Wednesday, it was when she was really not making any sense. And then I took it to the hospital, because I think she wasn't making any sense it wasn't herself, so I took her to the hospital, they said it was cannabis use disorder went home, she was still acting she started out, you know radically like it came. Again, she was she would it be okay, and then she will start not making any sense so, then I took it again to a different hospital and they said it was. anxiety too much anxiety they referred, and they told me that there was numbers, I can call if I wanted to have are mentally evaluated. Which that came to Saturday, and that Saturday, she was again it was just it seemed like it was just getting worse and worse and worse. So Saturday came and I ended up taking our to um I was trying to take her to a mental hospital or a mental urgent care and on the way there she tried to open the door from the from the car and I was driving down the freeway and she started getting hysterical she started like. hitting punching the car really getting out of control, so what I did is I ended up just calling her and trends and took her to a mental hospital."

214.0,Provider,Okay it's okay i'm gonna take you know that this is. I just got to see what she's available. um.
15040.0,Patient,"She didn't meet you didn't meet with somebody who I don't remember her name the first sharing, but she said that I had to get blood work done in my doctor appointment isn't until October six."

15040.0,Patient,No cuz I don't have a regular physician yeah. position with the right.
214.0,Provider,"Right. Okay, so what's going to happen is they're going to send an order to a lab. Whether it's a quest or you know I don't know what's out there, but i'll make sure that that information gets relate to you. As soon as I can touch base with Sharon, oh no well i'm on the east coast she's on the west coast, I don't know when she starts up today but we'll figure that out OK. OK so again natalie I appreciate your mom helping you, but everything that she said to me is that your understanding as well."
15040.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm experiencing it right now, at the moment."
214.0,Provider,"But this because i'm a stranger, and this is this isn't the easiest thing to talk about so we're going to take a breath. Because we have to get information and information is something that's going to help us both and it shouldn't be fearful. It actually should be relief right. We should think about you know Okay, so what other moves we're going to take on forward. How is my mom going to continue to support me and what is pride hearts role to figure out how they're going to help assist me that's what we're going to do right now so we're going to take it slow. I don't need to create anxiety, this is a safe place, I want to validate you, I want to provide you all the support you need, but these questions, allow us to understand how we can assist you and that's all I want to do is that OK, with you."
15040.0,Patient,"Yes, that's okay."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, great. So is there any substance issue use other than the cannabis vapor. How long have you been using the cannabis vapor."
15040.0,Patient,"Since I think August 16. Because I took it to. A dodgers game that day, the day I started school."
214.0,Provider,"So this this vapor is as of August 16 2021 correct. Yes, how often are we using it."
15040.0,Patient,"i'm not so much I use it that way, and then like the weekend of before yesterday, I news there with my brother."
214.0,Provider,Every hour every two hours every three hours every four hours every five hours.
15040.0,Patient,Every two hours.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, no problem, and does it provide you some type of relief, does it provide you an emotional support when you're uncomfortable in your emotions."
15040.0,Patient,"No, I just think I get like relax and lose track of stuff."
214.0,Provider,So we've never had to address this issue about the cannabis be vapor until today correct. So prior to the 72 hour hold were you ever in treatment for mental health. Did you ever think to yourself that you know what I am really uncomfortable i'm feeling antsy. And I don't know how to calm down.
15040.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,Does school work and the school and work feel overwhelming or do you think you're managing it.
15040.0,Patient,I think I was managing.
214.0,Provider,Are you no longer managing it.
15040.0,Patient,"I think, since I started this year, no, because my. Last year I was used to the eight o'clock classes, like my classes will start at eight o'clock and this semester, the classes start until 12 and I work two to 10 so my work schedule and my school work schedule wasn't like it was clashing."
214.0,Provider,"So did you find a need to have to choose one over another. Yes, and which one was that work."
15040.0,Patient,"School that I was at work, I like I didn't know how to quit work."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so boundaries. Okay that's not bad. A lot of people go through that hi. Do you have So these are personal questions and they're going to be a little anxiety driven if we need to pause and counted time we will, but there are questions that I need to know so do you have any suicidal ideations right now. when's your last suicide ideation."
15040.0,Patient,getting out of the car.
214.0,Provider,"I get it Okay, thank you any homicide ideations. Any self harm. And when you were trying to get out of the moving vehicle What was your thought process at that time."
15040.0,Patient,um I guess I hadn't hallucination of my aunt that passed away in 2014. And she told me that I was like in the devil's house.
214.0,Provider,Do you have you felt you're on. Talk to you again about that since then.
15040.0,Patient,No okay.
214.0,Provider,So now let's roll back to take just a little bit how much had you advice before you got in the car with your mom.
15040.0,Patient,"i'm it's weird sense because August 30 was the last time that I did it I like put my pen Oh, I actually gave my pen to my brother like he kept it for me, so I wouldn't do it again. So then, when you went to the hospital they told us that it would only last 12 hours so. I don't know."
214.0,Provider,"And, and do you can you confirm that this was only cannabis vapor not any other. Anything else that could have been put into that vapor that you're not aware of. So again, these are questions because your mom's on, but we have to go through them, so if it's something you feel you can answer right now i'll respect it Okay, so what was it like growing up as a child, with your family."
15040.0,Patient,"There was chama. My dad and my mom would always fight, since I was like born, I believe."
214.0,Provider,So we addressing arguing and yelling.
15040.0,Patient,"aren't coming in La. And then, when my younger brother was born, I believe it was like fist fighting."
214.0,Provider,So. to validate the trauma and understand that this is definitely something that you've heard and saw do you also believe that you were very much loved and careful.

So, like they got secondhand smokers lungs like I think all three of them, because he would smoke in their face and he wouldn't drink and my grandma was always like trying to find them and he wouldn't be on the street asleep. Like you look like a homeless, but he wasn't homeless like they had to go find them all the time."

214.0,Provider,Okay awesome well it's a good thing. You did not serve in the military correct. Do you have any financial or legal issues you're concerned with.
15040.0,Patient,"financial issues i'd say we're planning on moving out, so I want to help out my mom."
214.0,Provider,Do you have any children. Are you in a current relationship. Who do you live with now.
15040.0,Patient,I live with my grandma my mom's younger sister and then my mom and my younger siblings and I.
214.0,Provider,So what do you think about. The last part of the early conversation when we went to the mental hospital and they diagnosed with schizophrenia what what is going through your mind when you hear that.
15040.0,Patient,"i'm scared cuz I don't like understand what it is, I don't feel like I have it okay."
214.0,Provider,"Okay that's fair. So let's look at this from two perspectives one is we have information. To assist and the other one is, we need to figure out how we utilize this information to go forward right So for me information is knowledge and it allows us a way to figure out how to help someone without it it's very difficult to help someone, so I don't know. I don't get to see those reports of diagnosis, or what they said to you. i'm not sure even what the events that took place, how they happened, but they did, and what i'm saying is it's early to tell really what a diagnosis is is just too early, I do not want. To give anybody a specular Tory guess i'm, not only is that not fair to someone it's not professional, we can have people believing something's going on and that is not correct because what's going to happen is we're not going to trust people, we have to trust. So I think that if the abilify is helping. Right now, we need to continue it we shouldn't introduce anything again definitely not a pen and what we need to do is, we need to figure out how we're going to move forward. So right now i'm trying to wait for Sharon and figure out when she can see you because that's going to be someone who's going to be able to address a situation and figure out what correct medications are. Once I can get a discussion with her, then we can figure out what is a plan that we need to do to go forward does that sound okay to you."
15040.0,Patient,"Yes, it does, thank you."
214.0,Provider,you're very welcome. So mom do you have any questions for me.
15040.0,Patient,I did have one question I wanted to ask about the blood work like because I know that when she made the women for the doctor they gave it to her all the way into like October. Is there a way like do you think that it would be helpful to get like a cat scan of her brain like to see if there's like any chemical imbalance going on.
214.0,Provider,I don't I I think what i'm hearing and I always have a percentage of being inaccurate and something there may have been a point with school work and family became too much.
15040.0,Patient,"I can add something. about the also got on she was about I think it was about a seven eight where her father did. hit her like messed up kind of her face so that's something that right now that all this stress was going on with her, she kept mentioning. You know my nose is broken, and you know my dad broke my nose and there was like gnosis not broken your House is fine. So the reason why I took her to the hospital The first time was because I thought okay she's going through a mental breakdown because of everything that you know she stressed out with schoolwork home and really. So I know it was a mental breakdown and that was the first. Time that I took the hospital That was my thinking."
214.0,Provider,"I think you're thinking was accurate she needed to be safe, she needed to be assessed and everyone is built different everyone's capability of holding the bag open. is just different and in her case natalie I don't want to exclude you from the conversation, sometimes we get overwhelmed and and we can't process any more processing doesn't happen. And we shut down and that's that's a mechanism that we call flight, and we need to fly because it's it's overwhelming. it's too much circuitry it's starting to impact the way we think um you know whether it's a hallucination or whether it's a delusion it allows us to get away from the current moment because we're in the current moment we don't like so you know your trauma induced. could be very prevalent to you now, for some reason. It means that something happened. Internally, maybe you're trying to figure out why and how, and that may have caused it the idea here is we'll need to work through some of those things when we have the entire picture so. let's just use a pizza pie, if we have a pizza pie, and we have the don't we have the sauce we only have about two components, we kind of need all the ancillary spices and the additional things to figure out what the complete. thing looks like, and right now there isn't enough for me to even grasp what a complete picture is i'm starting to understand the trauma for sure the ptsd that's probably very prevalent to this. I don't know what they asked didn't ask in the mental health, but they they should have got that far and assessing ptsd for sure, and with the school and work and trying to be. Proactive as an adult to help family a mom is another stressor it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong natalie. And that's why I asked you do you think the role you're playing is the right role and you're helping your brothers and sisters get up for school. You know, some of us would say that may not be the right role, because your role has to be about what you need to do and what you need to fulfill so you have natalie here. With working school and then you have natalie here with siblings and then you have natalie here with family. And the obligations, you want to try to help and, if you look at it, I only gave you three components, it may be too many components to address one time. doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong it's coming from a good place but that could be the breakdown and we only have a capacity, all of us to address certain things it's not a flaw it doesn't mean you're broken it just means we need to figure out how to. rewire the hard drive through either medication or treatment and to get you to feel stronger and just to get you to see. things in a different way right your cognitive thinking is a little off so you're processing. between work and school, we may have to make a decision on that we may not be able to handle both today that doesn't mean you're less than and. I don't know my friend, does it and I know this other person does it we can't worry about why they can or cannot do it well, we need to worry about is. What we, we need you to get out of the gate slow and strong, so you can continue to do all the things you want right, so this early onset of figuring this out was extremely beneficial to both of you, I mean that sincerely. Because if we don't catch things early and they go on there's a possibility that not much can be addressed it's so early and making of the pizza. That we can figure out these ancillary things that you'll need and will support you, so what I want to do is go back in your chart for one minute and just look and make sure that all this contact information is correct, so we have 323636411 Is that correct."
15040.0,Patient,"Yes, that's my mom's number."
214.0,Provider,So mom how what's your availability to get Ahold of natalie to if these things are going to you know we have to set up appointments.
15040.0,Patient,"i'm usually the one on those appointments that they sent to her to her email, I actually took like a screenshot of them because i'm the one that reminding her like you have you log on at this time, you have to do this at this time, but they do send me like the text messages. reminders to my son. i'm at work, but usually i'm able to step out and like try to make sure that she knows what she has to log on."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so I want to presume because I don't can't remember everything i'm assuming you're Erica. Yes, okay so there's a release of information, so all this can continue to go it's going to go well, we need to do is. know that we care know that we hear you know that we want to help, I need to get the nurse protection involved the psychiatric nurse practitioner for a a follow up to figure out exactly what this diagnosis is. Okay, and remember a diagnosis, whether a mental health physical health we have high blood pressure. We make some adjustments to die, and we are medication, we find out what diabetic we made sure adjustments to our diet and we get medication so natalie whatever the diagnosis is. We just make the accommodation and we have medication it's not less than it doesn't mean you're not die it doesn't mean you're different than everybody, we just need to address it, as we know, the information and add the things that are going to help you okay. Any any questions that you need me or you'd like to ask, before we go."
15040.0,Patient,Is there a way that she can get or I don't know because right now that she she ended up quitting work she she and that I told her it was better for her not to go to work to just stay in school doesn't show any to do. Is there a way for her to get something that says that she's not able to work.
214.0,Provider,"So. That form, whether it's FM la or disability request has to come from a primary care doctor."
15040.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so. But with That said, the primary care doctor can refer to Sharon the psychiatric nurse practitioners notes and recommendations, so he. Some people may not feel comfortable doing a lot of mental health is general practitioners sunlight but he'll have the support of sharon's report to help facilitate this leave of absence because that's what we're asking for were asking for leave of absence. Right, so we want to make it official so there's no repercussions and there's always an opportunity to reengage it it in a later time that's exactly what we're looking to do here. So if you don't have a primary. We should try to get a primary which probably will take a little time, but in the interim, we have all this figured out. If you work for a company, you can start asking them for FM la paperwork and asking them for disability paperwork because you're triggering off something on the HR side. And they should be able to either assist you at least provide you with documents, so we can help you move forward with getting whatever you need done. Okay."
15040.0,Patient,Thank you.
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so what is your schedule like. during the week to see me because i'm your assigned therapist."
15040.0,Patient,"Under 10 o'clock is fine, I told, one of the ladies the 10 o'clock would be fine because it's in between my workout and, before I start school work so when I do this i've already like i'm done my exercise."
214.0,Provider,"If I may ask how much exercise, are you doing."
15040.0,Patient,it's like 10 minutes a day.
214.0,Provider,and tell me tell me what what it provides you.
15040.0,Patient,Like stress relief.
214.0,Provider,"awesome coping skills Okay, this is good let's let's at least. maintain the 10 minutes let's not drop that from activity okay cuz that's kicking off some type be the serotonin serotonin one of the happy hormones. That you need to keep kicking up and having work throughout your body let's not make any changes to the abilify either, so the next call is going to come from sharing or her administrative staff to set up an appointment way earlier than when you got what I like to be able to do i'm. So you said 10 o'clock works for you right 1112 one that's one o'clock my time i'd like to see you October 1. yeah I want to see you on October 1 at 10 o'clock. The other thing too is if for any reason you're not feeling well you're feeling either over anxious or truly truly uncomfortable. You need to call the virtual clinic and you tell them that you're assigned to me i'm on the crisis team. They will reach out to me immediately and we'll have a session that day you won't wait three days you won't wait two weeks, you will see me that day. So the majority of the people that I work with all West Coast based on East coast base but that doesn't change, for me, you all you need to know is this someone there to talk to them. don't hold back on that right, so if we call a crisis crisis doesn't mean you're going to hurt yourself crisis just means you're feeling uncomfortable and you really would like to talk to someone. But I can't help you unless you call them and say I need to talk to many they know to get in touch with me and they know i'll respond to you. So just tell me, our next date again, please."
15040.0,Patient,When is it. October 1.

15040.0,Patient,Thank you so much.
214.0,Provider,"you're welcome so remember natalie right we take it easy. We breathe, and we also use fact to combat fiction so something is fictional, we have to pause for a moment and we have to say how real and how factual Is it right, we have to instill some instead of flight, we have to go with some fight. right if you finding that difficult. You make sure you call the virtual clinic I give you my word, you will see me that day okay. Okay, all right to both of you all the very best I am here for you and I look forward to seeing you next week Okay, thank you okay you're welcome bye bye."
