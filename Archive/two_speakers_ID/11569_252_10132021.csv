252.0,Provider,How often do you. talk to them or trying to talk to him.
11569.0,Patient,see them every week. Every week.
252.0,Provider,"And you feel awkward communicating with them. Okay, so maybe, what we need to work on is some communication styles walking through. Fear, because a lot of it is fear based. You know okay well why do you can you identify why you're afraid to talk to them."
11569.0,Patient,"Because of my past. Sometimes. that's how I live. I lived in a dark room. When I was in high school very dark. D in a new, different long time. I have nothing else to speak about like the dark stuff. that's it."
252.0,Provider,"Okay well we've got to switch that off. yeah you know definitely focusing focusing on some positive stuff. What I know is that what you've experienced in the past and were you know, wherever or whatever your drug usage put you through or you went through with it. You have to know that and remember you're, on the other side of that and you're working to change, you know your thoughts and the way that you deal with things and that you have not used."
11569.0,Patient,and used for a long time. Right.
252.0,Provider,"And you have to keep that in the forefront of your mind, sometimes we have to write gratitude lists and the things that are good in our lives to even recognize that we do have good things in our lives. and focus on the good things in order to pull our mind out of out of just the dark things. You know. And maybe. Maybe the first thing that you should try to do with your friends is listen to some of the things that they're talking about and instead of you. Engaging and bringing up the past, you know the dark things that you that you're talking about that you're struggling with communicating with them with but really stay in a conversation with them about their stuff that they're look that they're talking about. and try that first try to practice that part."
11569.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,"You know, and that could possibly get us to that point where we can get you out of that dark thinking into some positive thinking. Why we're going through this process."
11569.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,What do you think.
11569.0,Patient,yeah that sounds good.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, and listening trying to listen to positive music happy music joyful what makes you happy. Right trying to really keep your mind out of that dark place. and keeping it into the light and every time you find yourself going in you've got to say no i'm not going to go there today I need to focus on staying right here, in the light, the more the more we practice that the more we do that, the more we're able to do that. Okay okay it's not something that we just can all of a sudden do right it's something that we need to practice doing. So we practice that until we see each other again. yeah okay."
11569.0,Patient,"And so. I assume, one more parents to speak to it."
252.0,Provider,So listen start listening and engaging in conversation with your friends and your parents. With what they're talking about.
11569.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Try that first first thing. Okay. Okay, any more questions for me. Lo OK so i'll See you in group, and I will see you in two weeks. are okay."
