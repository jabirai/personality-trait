748.0,Provider,"Okay, are you okay there."
15810.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so i'm Karen I these days I always say hi my name is Karen and like that. It is not the best name in the world to have these days. But. I am looking forward to getting to know you and I know that you, you already know you've been scheduled for a bio psychosocial which is just a big word to say that you're as far as I know you are isn't that what they said."
15810.0,Patient,"No, they said today will be my first appointment just a regular therapy appointment."
748.0,Provider,Really okay.
15810.0,Patient,"Because i've had three intakes and the last intake I had and they told me that I was going to be able to get on the medication, that I was on in the hospital and then I did the appointment and it was just another intake so now i'm like two weeks, out of not on medication."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, with."
15810.0,Patient,My real quick.
748.0,Provider,"that's really important for me to know, so what I am going to do is, I am going to go. double check my calendar and see what it says, for me, because I it's probably me i'm sure that it's that I made the mistake."
15810.0,Patient,"To be they just weren't clear with me, maybe I don't I don't know but I, so I had a like a what they told me he would be my first psychiatry appointment, but it was just another appointment. And that was on Wednesday, and so, then I had already expressed Prior to that, like on Monday that I wanted a therapist and a psychiatrist. yeah I have been in therapy pretty much my whole life and that I know that a psychiatrist only meets with me every few months to just check on my medication and stuff and I needed someone to be able to talk to you. That that was kind of my language of being able to get it out, I mean, like most people that's what therapy does but. ya know. For me. You know, I was like. I guess i'm not okay for just a psychiatrist I was like I need a little bit more than that, I got to work through some stuff so."
748.0,Provider,And my guess is that they'll probably have you in a group as well.
15810.0,Patient,"Yes, but they didn't give me any information on it. Okay, because I would they wanted me to do a me see what it says in my notes. yeah tend to group once a week. But that's all that was said to me, was attended group once a week so yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Well, you know you are scheduled I did just check, you are scheduled for what they call a bio psychosocial. But you know. All that means is that I, I will be getting a sense of what's most important to you to work on and where you are with those things as a and in in the process of getting that information, hopefully you'll start to feel like you're really able to talk. We can go from that point so. So that what you just said to me, was really helpful, what does bring you to therapy."
15810.0,Patient,"I suffer from severe anxiety. I believe. That I have severe postpartum either depression or anxiety i'm I don't know because i'm not a professional, but I have two toddlers and I have them back to back. At five and a half years to have our son and then our daughter was born. or she was conceived. Four weeks after I had my son like literally. So i've had no time. To kind of. adjust to that lifestyle so i've gone, you know i'm 36 years old and my babies are two and three, so I pretty much went my whole life with no babies and me my husband had been married or together for 13 years. So it's just been him and I for a really long time and then all of a sudden, it was like Bam and we have a house, full of kids. And my life has changed completely, so I went from having a full time career, I have a degree in marketing specializing in the beauty industry and I worked for MAC cosmetics for really about 10 years as well, not that you can tell, right now, because i'm not looking so beautiful but and."
748.0,Provider,"So i've been doing, I just. put on makeup just see me."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah no I I loved it but with getting pregnant and having babies, it was just too much to juggle everything and so. i'm a woman that can say enough is enough, and my husband said, you know i've always wanted to be a stay at home, so this it worked out perfectly he works in the movie industry but he's gone a lot. But when we didn't have children, I would just travel with him and I would just do stuff with him and I just kind of tagged along and now with two babies it's not that way so life has changed for us a lot, not necessarily bad, but changed, and then the pandemic it. I had a little small shop and I had had it before, but nothing too big just kind of selling stuff on Facebook and instagram just very small and my business overnight. went viral and we were making over six figures with in a month. It just. happened very quickly and the stress of it and the babies kind of pushed me into this not great place. In my head, to be honest and because they say, if you have it all you don't really have it all and that's kind of how I felt like I was like. I don't understand why i'm so sad I have such a beautiful life i'm so blessed and you know I have an amazing support team and amazing parents and I just couldn't understand why. I was feeling like this and my mom said, I think you might have a little postpartum or you know and there could be some other stuff in there, but you know, and that was something that through this experience. That i'm looking into trying to find an Ob gyn that specializes in postpartum to better. See if that's something that is going on as well, I was diagnosed as bipolar when I was in the hospital. that's, not to say that I am or that i'm not, but I do know that the medication, that I was prescribed that i'm still on now is working. LIFE I have instead of 15 thoughts, at a time i'm down to like one. Center."
748.0,Provider,On what is the medication.
15810.0,Patient,"i'm on 900 milligrams of lithium. And I. 300 million. yeah yeah it's totally slowed down my thought process, to the point where i'm almost forgetful which is not me at all. Because i'm someone that's just so on top of things that like I got into the car with my mom and she's like where's your sunglasses where's your phone and I was like oh I don't know I just my concern was getting the kids in the car. seats and I totally forgot about. My stuff that I needed, and so, and she was like no that's okay I just you know, like it's part of the one thought process you gotta slow down more and really take it in and stuff and it's been. A relief to not have so many thoughts going on, so I don't think that their diagnosis is wrong, I just had. A very interesting hospital stay, while I was there, so i've been very apprehensive of what the doctors had said. Unfortunately, I was violated the first night that I was in the hospital and that created trauma and me that I had to let go in order to move forward. With my treatment while I was there, because I knew I only had 72 hours, while I was there and I had to be home like pretty much on got there late Monday night and I knew I only had it till Friday more or less for childcare, and so I was like I have. 72 hours to pretty much figure out what's going on, and then I have to be home so. I just went to every group and I asked to speak to any therapist or any social workers that would listen to, because they didn't have. therapists and psychiatrists didn't want to listen to me talk and. yeah."
748.0,Provider,"good for you and you said, your by your first night."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah by a staff member and I didn't realize like exactly I knew something wasn't right about the way that I was handled, but I didn't know exactly and more or less the strip me down naked and treated me like I was in prison. And I found out from a staff member afterwards that should never happen and we call the police, so it was. They just yeah they were only supposed to have me undress halfway through I was never supposed to take off my undergarments I was never supposed to bend over or anything like that they also took me in a room with other clients. So the other clients were in there staring at me while I but naked in the shower and i'm just crying and crying and she's telling me to suck it up and get over it and take off your underwear take off your bra and I was just like. So I just did it because I don't My only concern is is that i'm in a very different mental state than I noticed a lot of patients that are there and My biggest concern was that it didn't happen to somebody that was less. Strong weaker than me I don't know I don't know how else to describe it, but I just felt like someone that was not in their right mind would not. be able to decipher this and I was even though I was you know there for my own reasons I was not in a place that a lot of the other women were. And unfortunately, and fortunately you know it doesn't mean that mine wasn't as severe as it was not taking away from that but definitely i'm not. schizophrenia or delusional or things like that, and some of the other women were. And so it scared me that that some of them wouldn't have someone to advocate for them where they couldn't advocate for themselves. So my only concern with the hospital at this point is the other patients, not necessarily the hospital itself, but as i've been told, which I don't know if this is true that the staff members have been let go that were in that position to do that to me. I don't. love them, so I don't know and nobody gave me their full a full names I got a first initial on the nurse that actually did it and I got a first name of the gentleman that threaten me with the 5150 if I wouldn't. stop talking about fact that I was violated a more or less that if you don't. shut up about it. i'm going to 5150 you and I said, are you threatening me and he said yes, and so I asked him three times in total to really make sure that that's exactly what he was saying, and he nodded his head and said yes, all three times. That he was threatening me and then I was told that I was not 5150 by my psychiatrist and then the night that I wanted to go home they said that I was 6158 and I couldn't go home until the next day. That okay so i'm just we're making it very clear that Glenn did a X actually execute that my psychiatrist liked me and said that I wasn't I don't know I just i'm."
748.0,Provider,"healing experience, to say the least."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah and for my first experience in an experience like that, where i'm going somewhere to get help and that's the help that I received it was a little jarring, to say the least."
748.0,Provider,So sorry that happened let's hope that going forward the experience that you have with bright heart is.
15810.0,Patient,"so far. yeah yeah so far really supportive and responsive and, on top of it and so i'm appreciative of that."
748.0,Provider,"fabulous i'm glad to hear, so I get you clearly it sounds like what really brought you to the hospital in the first place was a significant amount of depression feeling of Depression and anxiety and out of control what that."
15810.0,Patient,Is yet.
748.0,Provider,US yeah.
15810.0,Patient,"Monday I kind of hit the breaking point with all of it, and I was having suicidal ideations, which is the only time that i've had that I was. 16 or 17 years old, so over 20 years ago. And so I recognized it and I knew it wasn't right and I immediately reached out for help to my best friend and she called the crisis hotline and came immediately over to my house to make sure that my children were safe and that I was okay. And for air we had other friends come over to watch my children and she took me straight to. The hospital."
748.0,Provider,"Wonderful what a positive way to him, no really challenging situation for you and what wonderful."
15810.0,Patient,"you've been my best friend for over 25 years I wouldn't trade it for anything. In that moment, I think that she really realized like. That I really needed her. And in the chaos have been super busy, and she has an incredible career and I knew, she was completely busy and slammed and she just dropped everything and came straight to me, and it was just. I don't know I think part of me called her because I knew how busy. So part of me wanted her to not pick up and then part of me knew that she would it was like that double edged sword if that makes sense, where I was like we'll see what we get and she. didn't even flinch she took it for exactly what it was, and she came immediately to my house, and for that i'm forever grateful."
748.0,Provider,Oh.
15810.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"and good for you, for reaching out and and for acknowledging for noticing that double edged."
15810.0,Patient,"P, yes, yes."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, I don't want to, I want to help, but I don't want yeah. yeah but you're part of you wanted to help clearly."
15810.0,Patient,yeah no 100% 100%.
748.0,Provider,Okay. How about any history with substance is that has that benefactor alcohol or other drugs.
15810.0,Patient,Alcohol no I was on smoking marijuana. To kind of help with my stress and. It was kind of my. Only coping mechanism and now i'm completely sober so I had my husband have everything in the House before I came home. Since I was now medicated and I didn't need to self medicate.
748.0,Provider,"good for you, for recognizing how long were you smoking cannabis."
15810.0,Patient,Since I was born you. Know yeah yeah I was.
748.0,Provider,yeah.
15810.0,Patient,"So I knew that I had a dependency and I knew that it wouldn't be easy, but I knew that being in the hospital for the week would really like fight the curb on it. Like the hardest part was going to be done there more or less, and so I just told my husband just get rid of all of it. I don't want any triggers when I come home or anything like that and we don't keep alcohol in our House but i've said if there's anything. He said, there was a bunch of like Margarita mix that didn't have alcohol and He threw it away anyways from old parties and stuff, and so we typically don't keep alcohol in our home. Because my parents have had alcohol issues, so it kind of. Years little bit yeah like I don't know I just. it's just I don't know i've never experienced anything positive coming from alcohol usage. So it hasn't had a positive effective life, so I just chose and my husband's like in different like he'll have a beer at dinner everyone smile, but now that we're. sober he's chose choosing to be sober with me and he's like I don't need it so it's fine like we'll just do this together, and I was like I don't know what I would do without you so it'd be much harder if a word that I have, but I have awesome support team so."
748.0,Provider,marvelous are you connected with your parents now are you. Yes. Your mom so. yeah I know they're.
15810.0,Patient,"Very close to them very close to them. young parents, they were 19 when I was born, so we kind of grew up together so i've seen the good the bad the ugly with my family. yeah they're just different now like I would my mom's a yoga instructor and she's doesn't really drink and doesn't she doesn't she never has smoke pot or anything like that. But she's really a non drinker my pop up my stepdad who raised me he drinks wine, he does, they don't drink hard alcohol at all, and then my dad i'm not super close to but work on good terms. And I believe they drink, but he told me like this month they're doing sober October, just to kind of clear their heads, my brother passed away a few years ago. my brother passed away when he was 19 three years ago, and so they my dad and his wife, his game huh."
748.0,Provider,How did he die.
15810.0,Patient,"He was in his dorm room and it was like he was laying in bed, and he had a really bad cold and so he was taking antibiotics and. They don't know exactly what happened, but he was laying in bed, and he threw up and because he was on his back he swallowed it and. yeah I took. He passed away yeah. it's the. freak accident totally crazy. Totally crazy totally weird. yeah so it was he actually never met my children. Because he passed away before. He got a chance to meet them, so it was it's been hard, but you take it day by day, and you know."
748.0,Provider,"that's a huge loss, so he was 19 how long ago was that."
15810.0,Patient,"Three years ago, my son is three."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, with younger than you."
15810.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, so i'm the oldest. Of all of my siblings. The closest in age is me and my brother Austin and we're 12 years apart and that's the closest age gap to us is 12 years and so he's 23 or. 24 i'm horrible but I don't know this, but he lives in San Francisco and he's going to college up there with his girlfriend and then. So my mom has two boys and me and my brothers are like I said 2324 and 20 and then my father has me and then he had two boys and then another daughter. And so, he now has me and then his son Thomas and my sister Mary Jane so and and they're everyone's away at college, except for Thomas because I think. Thomas took Matthews death, the hardest he shared a room with him his whole life so it's been very difficult for him, I think he was also going to school in New York. And my dad and stepmom really wanted him to come home, I think it was really hard for them having the kids so far away so now he's home and he's living at home and, but I think he's going to be going to use filet. next semester when he gets more situated and more together and stuff he's a really great kid but I know that he's struggling with the loss of my brother and stuff so."
748.0,Provider,"We have a shared a room, my goodness."
15810.0,Patient,Life yeah so.
748.0,Provider,You had a lot of intensity in your life.
15810.0,Patient,yeah just a little bit.
748.0,Provider,A lot of siblings it's a lot of new people in the form of step parents and new families and you mentioned alcohol which i'm sure has lots of. History from when you were much younger. And so you know postpartum may well be the catalyst. Here is it was the opportunity I don't use that in a positive way.
15810.0,Patient,And you know.
748.0,Provider,It was the opportunity for all the trauma to just explode.
15810.0,Patient,yeah 100%.
748.0,Provider,So.
15810.0,Patient,"That and I, like, I believe that they said that I was bipolar when I was in the hospital and I said, I do have manic episodes I do have ups and downs, and things like that, and I do feel more stable from the lithium. But I do believe that there's some underlying postpartum and I do believe there's some other things that were not addressed, while I was in there, so the two medications it."
748.0,Provider,feels intense to me.
15810.0,Patient,Would you say.
748.0,Provider,"Your history feels very intense. And the things that i'm sensing from you is, you have a commitment, whether it's verbal or conscious all the time or. I don't know because I don't know you well enough yet, but you have a commitment to putting the most positive outlook on everything you possibly can. is beautiful however comma. And also mean that you push aside things that would be that you deserve to deal with, I even heard that about the hospital. you're rude about other people experiencing. To be violated more than you. yeah um What was your Toronto. yeah no that was your violation and you deserve support for that and to grieve that violation."
15810.0,Patient,is something i've allowed myself to. Read of how I would feel they didn't want to spiral.
748.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Well, on the line you it sounds like you also took on the job description of I have to be strong."
15810.0,Patient,"and want to be brave, for my babies and it's hard for me. I don't believe he started."
748.0,Provider,With blinks. It sounds like your babies started with your siblings. To be strong for them.
15810.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,So let's make your new job that you get to fall apart to heal. i'm do it for you. Because you do deserve that.
15810.0,Patient,hard.
748.0,Provider,You just stop believing. Like. drop. Good That was a great breath. glad you're here.
15810.0,Patient,I don't know why I was so scared for today but.
748.0,Provider,"you're meeting somebody you've never met in your whole life who's going to say okay tell me all about your pain. i'm a total stranger in. The bowl for you right, I mean it's it is challenging it is you're really vulnerable when you do something like this. yeah and you have no way of knowing if you're safe."
15810.0,Patient,"When i'm realizing as i'm talking to you that it's been years since i've seen someone and I went years seeing someone. to the point where I was like i'm therapy it out, you know because i'd seen someone for so many years and but it's been a really, really long time since i've had the talks what."
748.0,Provider,Well i'm really glad that you you're getting that now.
15810.0,Patient,me too.
748.0,Provider,Oh.
15810.0,Patient,"Is that i'm glad I spoke up and asked. They asked me for the first appointment and I said and I want a therapist I was like very. very, very adamant I said I know that that works for me I don't do well, which is the psychiatry department every couple of months to check on my medication, I need. Someone to get some of this stuff out to and they were like Okay, no problem, and so I was thankful i'm thankful my co pays only $5 and. Nice that this all worked out so i'm very appreciative and I I don't know what I thought it would be like I just didn't think it'd be like this and i'm thankful that it is."
748.0,Provider,really glad i'm really glad.
15810.0,Patient,me too.
748.0,Provider,And i'm really honored to be part of your journey.
15810.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,"and your babies are very lucky to have you and. and have someone that is taking this step to take care of themselves because you're not only that not only benefits them because you're stronger and better, which I know is what's in your head. That one affects them because you're being a role model for what's possible that you don't have to go through life alone you don't have to be tough you do get to be a human being and human beings need people."
15810.0,Patient,"I think, because my husband is so. Strong. That it has put me into that same kind of just being strong all the time and. Our son was diagnosed with autism about three months ago, anything that was part of my suck it up Buttercup you know philosophy like this is just what it is and we just have to be okay, with everything and I haven't had a chance to like take everything in. And then having a meltdown and having a special needs child and this and not and but like. I knew I don't know if it says it in my charter how much you know it, I knew that I was coming to a halt because I had called. To make appointments and I hired a nanny and I hired help before all of like two weeks before my meltdown. And because I knew it was happening like I knew I could feel it inside of me like I heard manny I had a housekeeper I literally. I called my best friend and I said, you know kind of your psychiatry number, I think I need to be medicated I don't think the way i've been medicating is working for me anymore. And she was like absolutely no problem, and one of my other good friends as a therapist and I know I can't see her so I said, can you recommend another therapist and she said absolutely and everyone was booked."
748.0,Provider,Every bed.
15810.0,Patient,"And I felt really defeated like I was like i'm doing the best they can, and everyone and. So finding bright heart health has been just like I say here, for me, because literally like i've tried in my area i've done everything that I can to find someone and literally nobody's taking on new clients and the. doctor that could take me on it was a nurse practitioner, you know, and I. said no problem, but I just cancelled it because they said at this point, I can do it through bright heart health and it's a nurse practitioner as well and i'd rather have all of my stuff all in one. Little you know pack then being going all over the place, and everything else that's a little too chaotic. and driving as a lot for me right now too so it's, this is just the best overall, for me, which I never thought that driving would make me anxious but i'm like everything makes me just. i'm just thankful for the help."
748.0,Provider,How long ago were you in the hospital.
15810.0,Patient,Two weeks.
748.0,Provider,Not even though it was.
15810.0,Patient,A week ago Tuesday or Monday.
748.0,Provider,"Do you know, are you aware that coming off of cannabis creates anxiety."
15810.0,Patient,"They never discussed any of my come downs, I was also on xanax. A lot. And so, and I know after doing research that it's a benzo. And they and they come down off that could be deadly and nobody ever discussed it with me, nobody ever treated it as a detox anything like that."
748.0,Provider,locks you or or just take you up.
15810.0,Patient,"They just took me off of everything. Okay, and I told him I was very, very honest about how much fun I smoked helmet xanax I took I even brought one of my xanax bars with me so they could see because I didn't know the exact milligrams so that they could better assess it and nobody ever treated me for any of that. And so I was in the hospital, I was on an Anti anxiety medication sleeping MED called ambien and I think the other one was vilified or. I can't it's downstairs in my paperwork and then the lithium. And when I left the hospital, they said they couldn't give me the sleeping meds or the anxiety meds but that I had a follow up appointment and then that doctor would get them to me and that doctor didn't give them to me. And I met with Dr this week and they said no, this is just your intake you know you have to do, blood work before we can prescribe you anything so I going on two weeks with. Zero anxiety medication or sleep beds, and so I don't I don't really know why. I just know that it was really it's been hard it's been really, really difficult because I whenever I was in the hospital anxiety medication they gave me was very mellow I didn't feel like I did on the xanax I didn't feel like it didn't hit me it was just a very. Low. Like I would notice like an hour later that I wasn't interest anymore like I did check in with myself, I was like oh."
748.0,Provider,You might. You might want to look at your paperwork and see if you can find what they had to one.
15810.0,Patient,"I do, I do have it written down. 100% I haven't written."
748.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
15810.0,Patient,"No, I get started with an A."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
15810.0,Patient,yeah I just thought it was weird that.
748.0,Provider,made and.
15810.0,Patient,"that's exactly what it was. I just thought it was weird that like for someone who suffers from severe anxiety attacks and they wouldn't give me anything but the lithium but. You know. And then the ambien like my husband had called because one of his friends committed suicide on ambien and so called them and he said I want my wife's taking office out immediately and they said no. we're going to keep running and he said, one of my good friends literally jumped off a balcony at the hard rock hotel and casino in Las Vegas and died. And I don't want my wife to die and she's already in a bad place in her head and I don't mean and they refused to take me off the medication. And then they put a note in my file that said that I had a MED complaint. I never complained about my meds they asked me if I was sleeping I said no, and I knew that I wasn't going to be sleeping because I knew that coming. Down off of marijuana I did a little bit of research before I left and one of the things that said was you weren't going to sleep. it's going to take about two weeks for you to get adjusted to your new sleep cycle, and so I took that into consideration and I told the MED tech that. I said i'm not sleeping but it's to be expected, since i'm coming down off of you know those two things. And he said Okay, so he made a note, and then they put it in that I refuse tobacco cessation therapy I don't smoke cigarettes. They wanted me to smoke cigarettes, while I was in there and I said no, it wasn't going to smoke cigarettes so. They just said that I was not complying with all of their requests and I was like to smoke cigarettes and take me I don't think I mean I don't know I mean I thought I was a little far out there for smoking so much Papa clearly. One flew over the cuckoo's nest over here and they're wanting me to take all these random things for their own I don't know I don't know it was a weird."

Her name was Sarah and she was an amazing an amazing person and actually somebody else that they're like Oh, we know Sarah and I was like she was amazing just so you know she's badass I love her and she was amazing.

And that, and I know that before that domini could give me medication they wanted my blood results. And I was like I just did blood work like literally right before I left the hospital that was part of my leaving and they were like oh just send us a picture of that that's perfect we can kind of see where you're out from not and I was like okay good because I don't want to go. To like work. It stresses me out a little bit, so I was like this is much better so."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and and they will probably right I don't know you know i'm I apologize I just don't know the best next steps, but I know the care navigators do a beautiful job of getting people scheduled and so forth, so."
15810.0,Patient,"contact me and if they don't all contact them they've been good about contacting me like I will get like three text messages in a row, and three phone calls and if I miss them they'll just continually call me so they're pretty good about it, so one."
748.0,Provider,"Excellent so I just have a couple more things mostly i've gotten a good sense of what your family life was like not a lot, but certainly from the beginning, a lot of sounds like there was a lot of change, a lot of intensity, a lot of people involved a lot of. relationships and a lot of responsibility on you. yeah and. When did your parents divorce and go their separate ways and start new relationships. You was you were three."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah so my mom at my step dad about she says about six months after that. So right before my fourth birthday, she met my step dad and they've been together, ever since."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
15810.0,Patient,"So he's been my dad forever he. I call him and he's been my papi forever he's always been my dad and he is. Not perfect by any means, but he's pretty awesome he's his family and him and my family, I should say they are my family his parents like I was always their first grandchild. I was never looked upon as anything other than that I was always his daughter always when he would introduce me this my daughter bettina. i've never been anything other than that so like and my parents honestly they get along beautifully they're really good friends and. They never talked negatively about each other, like, I never grew up with divorced parents that like fodder bigger now. I mean, I saw my dad every other weekend until I was in like junior high and then my mom let it be my choice and I kind of stopped visiting him, other than the holidays or special occasions, because I was a bratty teenager I don't know because I didn't want to go out there, but."
748.0,Provider,job description it's a teenager right is.
15810.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I like I don't want to go out there and one of my friends with out there, and he was passing actually like they live in San Marino and we live in, like I live in more park now, but like camera Rio thousand oaks area is where I grew up. Okay, so it's about 45 minutes way it's not too bad, but it was far enough, that I was like I don't want to go over there it's not fun and you know what."
748.0,Provider,Where my friends are.
15810.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so and then he met his wife. I want to say was around the same time. I want to say about junior high. And it worked out for them to heat and push it because my step mom got pregnant pretty much immediately with my brother Matthew. So I think for them, they were just busy in their stuff and it wasn't there was never a resentment or anything like that it was just how it kind of happened and then through the years we've gotten closer and. we've taken space and we've gotten close we've taken space and but, for the most part, I know that my dad tries his best to the best of his ability he's one of 17. yeah so I know that he hasn't always have the best. example for what being a good parent is because he didn't really have super present parents, because, by the time they got to him, they were like done. According to my parents, you know that that's how it's been described to me that my grandparents more or less moved out of that house and moved to the beach house which I knew that that had happened. So they moved down to San Diego and they kind of left him my uncle David. And a few of the other siblings uncle David and my dad are the two youngest and they kind of left them at the House and just kind of let them fend for themselves and go figure both of them ended up with pregnant girlfriends. And so. Danny is the same age as me and she is. Certifiable. Bob love her, but she is. Taking her own journey in life and part of that she was someone that I was very, very, very close to, but she loves going to South America. And she loves living it she lived in Peru, for a really long time, and he loves it down there but part of that is she did a lot of like iowa ask I think it's called. And that's messed with her completely like she's not I don't know."
748.0,Provider,"yeah very careful with that I I. I know it's it's actually recommended by one of my favorite people on the planet, that does work in trauma and addiction and and I."
15810.0,Patient,Thought why.
748.0,Provider,"That is is really is really true, you have to be very careful."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah I think that she just. I don't know how she is now because i've had to take a step back from her because she's just not healthy for me with my babies and so like a few years ago, before they were born. We had kind of taken a step back from our friendship slash relationship, because it just wasn't healthy. And she was almost looking to me to be like a mother figure, and I was too much responsibility for me i'm like i'm your cousin and I love you and I can be like your sister, but like i'm not in a position to take care of anyone other than myself and my children. And so. For her I heard that she's doing well now but she's still kind of delusional in the things that she thinks about or remembers or like so she looks at me in a certain way. And like we've never had an issue, but like she doesn't talk to me a few years, and the last I heard that she was not talking very nicely about me. I don't know why Maybe she got a thought in her head she just couldn't get out because i've been there, too, so I understand that, but. I just had to be okay with letting it go, which was a new thing for me, too, because I have a really hard time with letting go stuff like that, but you know it's been taught to me that it's none of my business what anybody else thinks about. What other."
748.0,Provider,none of our business. lives that but it's true.
15810.0,Patient,"it's true, for she was one of the only people I could kind of do that with because I knew that she wasn't right in her mind it's harder for me to do that with like my friends or things like that, when problems arise with her, I was he's crazy i'm good I can let that. That has nothing to do with me, I should use the C word I don't like the crazy word, but she is definitely."
748.0,Provider,Well she's done some things that is that have really distorted thinking and capacity yeah.

But the notes will get transcribed from ness and taken care of and i'm sure a care navigator will be reaching out to you, quickly and if they don't you reach out to whomever has reached out to you."
