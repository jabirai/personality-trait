13530.0,Patient,"Okay, hang on one second. All right, area. There we go okay good morning."
214.0,Provider,"Good morning, how are you today."
13530.0,Patient,"Oh i'm Okay, how are you."
214.0,Provider,"i'm good, thank you for asking. um just trying to pull up your chart here because I don't know what the big muscles this morning but anyhow, how do you how are you feeling."
13530.0,Patient,"Well, unfortunately, my over the last I think we saw each other about four weeks ago um. My depression got pretty bad there's been a lot of bad environmental factors. But it did, and unfortunately hasn't been good."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're communicating it hasn't been good, and then we have a laughter right."
13530.0,Patient,"All right, i'm sorry that's just kind of my way."
214.0,Provider,I realized that. And what i'm saying is. So what is it about the environment it's unhealthy.
13530.0,Patient,"Okay, so like a lot of it has to do with like exposure to someone with coven and like none of my friends would hang out with me in that time so kind of just been alone for four weeks and not seeing anybody. And so that really doesn't help I mean one of my. preferred past times i'll say is just kind of spending quality time with people so like I just can't do that for four weeks, and then it just became extremely stressful with like school and work for like exams that's been termed season so to have those two things kind of like. melt together that really kind of bait a bad situation i'm. A grandma grandpa this in the hospital he's an amputee now so oh yeah."
214.0,Provider,So did you catch covert in your own quarantine of.
13530.0,Patient,i'm that good if it's just none of my friends will see me because i'm living with someone that has coded or had.
214.0,Provider,"Oh, are you are you feeling I don't know you feeling like discriminated against. That feeling was that really going on."
13530.0,Patient,"To some extent because, like obviously I totally get like the first two weeks after they test positives and then like you know until they test negative, but to wait longer after that is definitely weird."
214.0,Provider,yeah and have you been tested.
13530.0,Patient,i've been tested like four or five times and i've always tested negative.
214.0,Provider,So are these friends that you've had for a while they new to you or.
13530.0,Patient,"I have had them for a while, which is strange."
214.0,Provider,and have they actually been able to express why or can you figure out where the discrepancy is and what they're doing.
13530.0,Patient,"I, to be honest, I don't understand why they believe this or why they're so cautious I did talk to them about it and tell them that, like well i'm not cool. Right and like I did I did go to them and be like hey, this is it cool, especially because. I had recently introduced like two groups of friends together or groups, but mainly like two individuals. And you know they've been hanging out these four weeks, while i've been. i'm. Important to you at first, they were kind of hiding it from me, and that is like I would even ask him what they're up to and they would like hide it from me that they're hanging out together and that really kind of hurt. My God like i'm not here to like say like where they can and can't hang out with, I would just. Like i'll just directly hide it from me like that that feels terrible."
214.0,Provider,Absolutely.
13530.0,Patient,Like. And like I didn't go to them and they they understand why and they like they have apologize. um but you know I still.
214.0,Provider,"I would agree with you, I think that that's that's. Unless one of those things I don't understand you're telling me one thing, but i'm kind of feeling it's something else and."
13530.0,Patient,"Yes, I. comfortable but matter what you kind of just didn't care enough like either of you to do to care enough to. know and just."
214.0,Provider,What was their communication about meeting up again or. that's just in limbo.
13530.0,Patient,"know that they've been they've been courteous about hanging out again we're gonna hang up this weekend it's just. I still kind of feel like I have to command respect and I hate that like I really shouldn't have to, and I feel like kind of like an asshole for doing it, even though it's just kind of something I should have."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I think I think first of all, you know the commanding of it it's just a human trait just tell me the honest truth of what what's going on. right number two is. The you know there's the other side understand how resentment builds and actually can collapse, a relationship just because the simple truth was presented in the beginning."
13530.0,Patient,"Right exactly so. i've had problems with it um I still have been having only talk to one of them in person about it and that's bothering me, so I got to talk to the other person like face to face about it."
214.0,Provider,Because your depression score is the highest it can possibly be.
13530.0,Patient,yeah i'm not doing well today her last couple weeks.
214.0,Provider,"i'm sorry to hear that I mean. I thought that there was some good trajectory and launching and I guess, this is a setback, I guess. On top of everything else, obviously right."
13530.0,Patient,yeah I was gonna say like that's not the only thing it's.
214.0,Provider,"I agree, I mean. So. What, what do you feel is resolution, what do you feel is something to get back to like do you feel that there's a there's a good potential, this will resume we can get over this, are you trepidations of I don't know they really my friends what's really going on."
13530.0,Patient,"I gosh that's such a good question. I don't know I honestly thought now. it's, not that I don't think they're not my friends it's just. I don't know at this, they still didn't have the care enough to tell me that they're gonna."
214.0,Provider,"I don't I don't disagree, but i'm i'm I don't want to minimize it on and I don't want to. appear to be like i'm not validating you, but on the other side. You know if. it's it's a little odd to me why they just couldn't tell you a BA BA BA BA BA. So I had that that hidden fact of. Islam so what's really in our relationship."
13530.0,Patient,"Right that's that's what i'm considering and that's why this is so sad it's like i'm like, why is this a hidden thing like why."
214.0,Provider,"I I I don't even know why but i'm wondering if at some point, and I have to play the role of both parties if they thought. This was the best way to address it by hiding and conniving thinking, you know that, with all the best of intentions, but not realizing actually how catastrophic, you can be when it's found."
13530.0,Patient,"Right right, I think I do think that is what it was like in hindsight, anyway, like, I am all sure that that's what it was they just didn't want to do with the whole coven thing and they're very cautious people and. they're both classmates and work with children in child development, so I get it, I totally get it. I just you know why'd you have to hide it from me like."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I. But is that enough. Let me rephrase that because that's not funny is, that is, that is, is that going to be a particular obstacle that we can't get through. Well, we don't know right now."
13530.0,Patient,"No, I like to think I can get through it. I guess, there is just."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but it takes a toll on you in a mental and physical capacity. Oh so you're trying to do other things and. On top of that address other things that come your way like this isn't the only wave that's come."
13530.0,Patient,"Oh yeah no no it's it's not gonna be easy, but. it's not gonna be here, but."
214.0,Provider,Again again.
13530.0,Patient,I certainly don't want a lot worse before so.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but I think the idea here is to. To have an understanding is a workable, or is it not and then make those determinations based on that you know and it's it couldn't came in a worst time with with happen with family and then we've got schooling and it's like."
13530.0,Patient,"Randy we really could not have come in a worse. Time. So it's like really guys like what I mean they both say they feel horrible about the situation and they just weren't thinking, but."
214.0,Provider,doesn't change I didn't happen.
13530.0,Patient,"doesn't change the fact that it happens so like with their reaction, it seems like you got through it it's just I do have to take the time to talk to both of them and. It doesn't help them we're all very busy people."
214.0,Provider,"I know I know because. It lingers right you can't put it to rest so it's actually surface on the surface, I. get it has it has it bothered the way you think about yourself."
13530.0,Patient,"And yes, yes."
214.0,Provider,I figured that.
13530.0,Patient,"It makes you kind of think will like Why would they like just die. Tell me like what. I like is it I don't know. I mean they say it's just because they thought I was the best way of not making me jealous but. I just didn't think about how it wasn't going to find out, they like didn't hide it at all, like, I found out pretty much instantly and I was just like okay be honest. Did you do this is like yeah like."
214.0,Provider,you're right totally right but let's also throw that into the world when they admitted honestly.
13530.0,Patient,They didn't.
214.0,Provider,Like they weren't like hey zach like I think he I think you know understanding some like they didn't do.
13530.0,Patient,It I went to them like beyond its did you do exactly this. And they were like yes.
214.0,Provider,"Okay well. I didn't do that honesty doesn't feel great it doesn't. But, but there is something about Okay, so that changes the way I want to perceive you because you were transparent and you, you gave me the truth when ask instead of dodging a bullet Okay, then it does change somewhat okay."
13530.0,Patient,Ada exactly that's why I like yeah I did. They suggest. You guys do this first. wouldn't feel so bad.
214.0,Provider,"Again, I totally get it, I and I respected as well, but I think this I think we'll be able to get through it and, hopefully, they learn to that it's just best telling you something up front, even if it's not going to be warm and fuzzy this way it doesn't leave all this residual you know. My street feeling right."
13530.0,Patient,"And you know exactly what I told him it's like yes you're right, I totally would have made me jealous I already got jealous whether you were going out and doing something about our blocks i'm at home and can't do anything but i'm jealous and you live like."
214.0,Provider,"yeah no it's it's a double hit nine years. I agree, but any any any thoughts of wood there any intrusive thoughts were there anything. about the way you felt about yourself the world for me. to manage that."
13530.0,Patient,"Sir, certainly um I certainly was feeling bad about like my relationship with other people and just kind of like what it means to you know other people. um. um yeah so I was thinking about that a lot of ways, and how there's definitely a lot of relationship I don't demand respect."
214.0,Provider,And how do you propose to address that with someone.
13530.0,Patient,"Honestly, I don't know, because this is something i've had to do with pretty much all of my ex girlfriends and it's never ended well. i'm. Not."
214.0,Provider,"Totally sure you're finding it difficult to have a boundary are you finding difficult to tell someone listen I have value I love myself, but I don't love myself less for you to treat me the way you treat me. Like I I I believe in myself, and this is what i'm what i'm when i'm receiving this. I can't accept it because I love myself like it's a good way of telling somebody listen you're not going to deteriorate my belief system and I don't have to get all nasty about what you're not doing for me, but i'm clearly going to tell you. That I love myself, and this is unacceptable."
13530.0,Patient,You know I actually don't have a problem with telling people that it's it's a matter of. I don't think I tell them in the right way. At least in considering their situation. Maybe if that makes sense.
214.0,Provider,But neither are they considering your.
13530.0,Patient,Situation yeah exactly like. yeah. It does ways here but.
214.0,Provider,"by them and maybe maybe not saying you need to do my wording and parroted but maybe addressing it in a way, where I have value, and right now, this this communication yeah it's it's. it's it's. it's really I can't allow it, because of my belief system and how I care for myself and that's not saying like you're an effing idiot I don't like the way you talk to me. Like that's really concrete information."
13530.0,Patient,Right certainly so yeah that's just the way I have to bring it up and but yeah exactly that I need to.
214.0,Provider,"be helpful. I think it's helpful to start cultivating that so you can create a stronger piece of Armor and foundation where it's it's it's. it's one of the things you establish early instead of one things you try to establish sleep, because once we condition somebody to a relationship like. hey, this is a change man like you should have brought that up three weeks ago and it's like yeah I know but i'm I need to bring it up now, first I, this is the first opportunity I felt I needed to bring up. So, like it just about changing the way we incorporate. are the ones that we have, and then the ones that are coming in, you know what is it that we're trying to tell them about us. yeah I I think I think it's important for you to do it, and I think, as you do it you'll see what I would say the tide change, where people be less likely maybe to be abusive or to utilize you at their at their will versus you can't get the same Richard price of you from now."
13530.0,Patient,I understand I make sense.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so I think you know I would definitely I think it's a good conversation with you have with your friends about like listen I love myself. I love myself less the way you treated me so like remember that. Like yeah just put it on the table, put the cards on the table let's let's get this moving and hopefully. Because it is a tough time because other things, hopefully this this evolves nicely it flourishes and we can put this to rest and address what we need to address fundamentally up front. All right, good so everything looks great on your chart hopefully I see you next week, which is good because I want to see. i'd like to see that depression score go down."
13530.0,Patient,"You see me next week. Oh, you mean right on Monday."

214.0,Provider,"Okay right I listen I think i'm hoping that you were least allowed to release some of this negativity and then say okay I kind of see that they were up front, they were truthful it. Still doesn't make me feel good. yeah and I need I need clarification I need to figure out how to make time clarification and then I need to establish what am I ground rules when I enter into new ones, and what am I going to tell the people that are already you know."
