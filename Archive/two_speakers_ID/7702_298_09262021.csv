7702.0,Patient,hey.
298.0,Provider,mama how are you.
7702.0,Patient,i'm doing great.
298.0,Provider,"so glad Oh, my goodness, I just remembered I make you a promise and I broke it I said I would email you what the latest is on. suboxone and pregnancy."
7702.0,Patient,Oh right that's okay.
298.0,Provider,and
7702.0,Patient,You said it's safe now like.
298.0,Provider,"i'm like yes, so what this what the latest information out there, says that suboxone and pregnancy are okay it's a go ahead now it's ago it used to be, if you got pregnant, you went to sub you tax, but now they're saying suboxone is fine during pregnancy."
7702.0,Patient,"But then, how long like at what point do you have to like I mean, I know I i've been tapering because I don't want the baby to be addicted to it when it's born."
298.0,Provider,And so we have. We have some people who. were not able to do the taper and when their baby got to like six months and they really the baby started to really put on the weight that's when that we had to go up on the dosage which. Because the baby was using some of the suboxone so we weren't able to do it if you want to try a taper it's not highly recommended because it's a little bit of stress on your body um.
7702.0,Patient,i've been trying. i've been trying to taper a little bit like I think i'm done like three quarters of a strip now. So hopefully I can like start going down down down like within the last have seven months left so. yeah like to try and get off.
298.0,Provider,get off of it. And I applied to that. I just informed you it's not recommended because it. right but. But you already are at two milligrams I think you can get off of it.
7702.0,Patient,Be awesome if I could What would you recommend what would your recommendation me like how slowly should I like come off of it like what would the next dose be.
298.0,Provider,"So there's nothing smaller on the suboxone to milligram film there's not anything smaller than that you have to cut it yourself. So cut it in half. And so you do have a tablet for two weeks. And then. The half you cut and forth, and then you do a fourth for two weeks, and then see if you can just stop it. From there. So you basically would take a month to get off of it."
7702.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,And if you can do it great.
7702.0,Patient,Okay. Oh i'll definitely try that for for a couple weeks awesome.
298.0,Provider,How are you feeling.
7702.0,Patient,"i'm feeling pretty good it's just my like it seems like lately today's been good I just ate a bunch of nachos because we're watching the raider game ate a bunch of nachos case India ice cream like i've been crazy. But like evening, time is when I get my morning sickness and so I have to eat all fruits and veggies for dinner, or else it it'll come up. So Okay, but everything else seems pretty good. I have been having like random depression episodes though I don't know if that's normal or. But I was going to talk to you about that to have you heard of that."
298.0,Provider,"it's more of an Ob gyn type of thing, and the only reason i've heard of it is because you're having fluctuations in your estrogen and your progesterone as you get further along in your pregnancy you develop higher progesterone levels progesterone makes us feel so."
7702.0,Patient,"wonder, yes I didn't. I didn't put a projection cream on when I like realizing like I hate the world everything's in disaster."
298.0,Provider,"Right right and so what's so nice about. Being pregnant is that progesterone high that you get even afterwards as your body is shrinking down. This is a little side note about me is I had seven miscarriages in between. My first child and my second child and one of the reasons was is because I had a dmc on my first miscarriage and they like scraped out my uterus terribly. And so, every time that I would get pregnant I didn't maintain enough progesterone to maintain a pregnancy, so what happened would be at miscarry so finally. They figured out, it was a progesterone problem and the minute that I got pregnant this one less time with my second child. They had me use so many medications and I had to you know they were bad gentle medicines, and so my daughter came out and she has the kinky she has really curly hair and we teaser it's because i'm all the medicines, I had to do. well. Right after she was born I got pregnant again because we weren't using birth control, getting pregnant is not the problem it's the fact that I had always miscarried. Well, I figured I have a three month old I don't care if I have another baby i'll just miscarry it, but when you give birth to a baby you maintain higher progesterone levels than you normally would, and that was enough progesterone for her sister to be born."
7702.0,Patient,Really wow.
298.0,Provider,yeah enough that I didn't have to do extra medicines to keep.
7702.0,Patient,"Your thinking you're gonna lose it anyway, but."
298.0,Provider,"And she's just my pride and joy my youngest one and she's still with us, and she goes yeah my family was willing to lose me."
7702.0,Patient,"that's a cute story, though."
298.0,Provider,"yeah if you knew her she's just a fireball and she's so intelligent, and I mean such a blessing they. Then I really light up my life."
7702.0,Patient,"yeah that's awesome I was told, since I was 16 that like because I have really bad endometriosis and saw that I had a 10% chance of having a baby before 25 and so after 25 I was like i'm never gonna have kids like i've had multiple relationships and. Like I just never got pregnant until now 34 years old."

298.0,Provider,"i'm excited for you, so I encourage you to do you know, to have these talks with when you get your appointment about what you're doing with the suboxone that you're smelling your. You are doing a very slow taper off make sure they know you're only a two milligrams two milligrams is almost. you're almost done coming off of it. Okay, but. yeah yeah you're doing great i'm you having cravings any thoughts."

But other than that no i've been i've been fine I had I had like i'll just get like mock tales like yesterday I had dinner I got like a virgin bloody Mary or are just get like.
