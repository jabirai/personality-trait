740.0,Provider,i'm good. I apologize for the for the delay.
14727.0,Patient,"that's Okay, I was playing myself. Checks into the wrong link and yes."
740.0,Provider,"It happens it happens, what is good to see you. Welcome so bright heart."
14727.0,Patient,Is.
740.0,Provider,"So good deal. So we're going to start out, which is going to have like a get to know type session i'm going to ask you a few questions. If any of my questions same too uncomfortable for you to to answer just kind of let me know and then we'll kind of move forward from there, the first question that I have is there, what brings you to treat me and why have you decided to come now."
14727.0,Patient,"well. I just had a long history with mental health they've worked with county men on off most of my life i'm actually on SSI for mental disability. I had a very, very, very, very friendly traumatic childhood. And a lot of my. LIFE has had a lot of trauma in it. I. just completed that. program here, and you know i've tried to work with a lot of my own stuff. In there, I have been on. On medications for a number of years and stuff and I found when I got to my last semester, and it was the mental health. class that I have a lot of trauma still left unresolved, especially around my mental health. So I really kind of been under a product esther's best anxiety. A lot of things going on. and The last thing I wanted to do is find myself in crisis mode. And i'm trying to get everything under control, I have been working with my therapist for six years. And I mean i've had her, thankfully, but I felt like I need more."
740.0,Provider,Can you hear me.
14727.0,Patient,I didn't hear what you said.
740.0,Provider,Any substance abuse history at all.
14727.0,Patient,"I do have some of that when I was younger i'm coming out of my mom was a heroin addict growing up last night at nine just put aside and. My mom kind of really honestly introduced me to methamphetamines. I really haven't like I don't have a huge huge history, but I did use it to self medicate in my early years of life, like as an adult. And i've used it a couple of times, often on. After you know the few years of my early 20s but. It doesn't it, you know, the thing was is that my mom would sell me to bring them getting really deep really quick, but my mom would tell me to her drug dealers, for her drugs, and I remember it starting at the age of 10 I don't know. What happened before then, but my earliest memory. memory of it was 10 and when I realized that that drug made it where I didn't have to sleep. I didn't feel like I was threatened because I didn't have to be vulnerable, and that was where my mind state was when I was younger. than trying to figure that out, and when my mom passed away when I was 23 I really started to reassess things and I decided to go to college, rather than to continue to use."
740.0,Provider,Okay awesome amazing.
14727.0,Patient,"So yeah and. yeah the same time, I tried to go to call it, and after my mom died that was kind of what. I ended up. In the mental health stuff because I. hate, to put it this way, but her death was a blessing to me because no longer did she have that manipulation and control over me that I feared I couldn't escape. And so it gave me leeway to start to try to make my own decisions feeling like I think could no longer be influenced by her. and So that that was a big pivotal changing point in my life, and I did end up in mental health because I felt guilty, for the way I felt when she passed away. And you know losing my dad nine to suicide and a lot of shit I realized, I had to deal with, and I was misdiagnosed and wrongly medicated for many years i've been on. upwards at times to seven to 10 mental medications at one period in time. i've been through a lot of them. I know a lot of them do not help me. I know the ssri is, I was very suicidal mood stabilizers literally if I didn't if I ran out and I missed a day I would literally be locked in my house paranoid everybody was coming to kill me. say I think that the medication know the medications were wrong, a lot of them, I mean when they have you on trezza don't and geodon and Prozac and energy. And fun and and. You know, and the list goes on there. You know. they're definitely overmedicating I have not been. on human health. number of years. we've lived here in Eureka for. Seven, and I have tried. To go any route, but county mental health. So if that helps you understand some of the trauma hover around mental health and why. They kind of kicked everything into high gear for me that's why i'm here. yeah and that's a small amount there's a lot more to unpack. short story."
740.0,Provider,And we will we will definitely. continue down the road. If any if you hear anything in the background. Okay.
14727.0,Patient,"it's okay I got little ones to he just happened. To be a full right now, thankfully, so. it's quiet and my background my name fool a."
740.0,Provider,minute spiel if you hear page so.
14727.0,Patient,"Yes, don't worry. Too yes personally like no worries."
740.0,Provider,"Oh i'm happy that you stop using that you decided to go to college and speed even even with the traumatic experience in regards to be misdiagnosed being on improper medication. Then being you be have loved ones that passed away. And so that's that's a lie that's a lie. I mean, I know."
14727.0,Patient,I lost my son six hours after he was born a couple of years for my mom died. While you. ever. had a lot of on him I lost my grandma who is like my mom when I was seven and that meant that I know is surfing with my heroin addicted mother. My father sexually molesting us when he wasn't to. permanently take us from him so he had no fight in court which but his him committed suicide. So yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So much la. la so much green. And we, and will, I will definitely talk more about that moving forward. One thing. i'm desperate i'm so sorry. He is two and a half months."
14727.0,Patient,Also.
740.0,Provider,"What was that I never want quiet think i'm not focused on them, but this. boat bar but i'd be curious to see how I was able to repeat it back to you yeah. But so. You said you've had a sigh patches for the past six years."
14727.0,Patient,"No, no, not a psychiatrist a therapist."
740.0,Provider,therapist okay fair. yeah okay. yeah how did I.
14727.0,Patient,Find Roi for you guys she said that phone calls for information from her if you need it works best.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so how, what do you get treated. would be that's not what I wanted."
14727.0,Patient,But it was her diagnosis.
740.0,Provider,know why did you go to her for therapy what what kind of a if it's a she.
14727.0,Patient,"She is a licensed clinical social worker. Okay, he is like a more she had she has her own things so instead of going through county mental health, to find a therapist in hearing Eureka with partnership and being on SSI I had a choice to either go county mental health or use beacon to find therapy."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
14727.0,Patient,And I go to see the beacon to do that because I did don't want to go to county mental health again because I knew that. I knew that I was not being medicated right.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14727.0,Patient,"And just a little background my husband and I have known each other, since we were 15. We split up after our oldest was born when at 17 we had him we split up right before his 20th birthday my husband he's a few months younger than me, so I was already 20. But we've been in and out of each other's lives and been in another relationship with each other over the years that we've been back together 10 years now."
740.0,Provider,Okay awesome.
14727.0,Patient,"And, as a matter of fact, if it wouldn't have been for him, I don't know if I would have every understood that. That I was being wrongly medicated overmedicated and stuff because he knew me, you know before and came back into my life after when all this was going on. And was around me daily, and he is like you're not you don't know what's going on and I don't know if this is right for you and it started making me think maybe it isn't. You know, maybe i'm just giving my power over to whoever this is that medicating me and i'm just allowing this to happen and. i'm convinced, I have borderline personality disorder on that i'm never going to be any better if I don't take these medications and it was like pounded into my head for 15 years by different county mental health psychiatrists that I would never be okay without these medications. And then somebody who has known me since I was 15 coming back into my life to be like wait a minute I don't think they're right. You know in this. Someone that I love that I trust that knows me and i'm like well, maybe they're not right okay so maybe I can start looking at it from a different perspective and really start to question whether I think what they're doing is right."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14727.0,Patient,"So I mean that was where all that started and actually with his support and stuff I was able to start getting off of a lot of the medications that I shouldn't have been on he saved me from swallowing pills many times. You know because I was this title and stuff. So I mean he has been an amazing support system for me, but I also know, right now, that my little five year old told his Daddy. That because I get chest pains, really, really bad and really bad headaches when they anxiety attacks happen and i'm I mean i'm taking xanax and there's still happening. And it's really, really bad and I know they klonopin I was on in two milligrams four times a day and that was one thing that controlled my anxiety was the benzo was the ssri maybe you want to commit suicide. i've been on zoloft paxil Prozac I mean, not to mention the number of other seroquel abilify and in tripoli's tripling trump tries to don't I mean, I have a. i've been on i've been on neuron, which is that I can't remember the other name for it but it's the. yeah i've been on like probably 2530 different medications for mental. Health stuff and I definitely can tell what works and what don't from my experiences of 15 years of those medications."
740.0,Provider,"medication, been able to be stabilized now or have you been able to talk to one of our physicians here be."
14727.0,Patient,"angel talked with chantel who are meeting with the you and her tomorrow. And she did in two milligrams of the cynics a day, and I think that my face and probably needs to also be taken at night, not just in the morning and I spoke about that, because of the ptsd so it definitely have ptsd and anxiety. I know, those are for absolute sure i'm I mean being a social worker I I definitely know that. And that's what my therapist was diagnosed me with. yeah. And I mean. yeah we've had a lot of stressful stuff going on right now, my father in law's houses which is my husband's childhood home is like a half a mile from being on fire and coffee creek. And the firefighters really can't do much about it they're just kind of in the mode where it's just going to have to burn. yeah there's so much going on."
740.0,Provider,Any any busy at home in June.
14727.0,Patient,"Yes, we we actually he does the home, insurance, and I mean made sure that he's got all of that up to date and everything we find out for all of it got really bad so he's here with us. So."

740.0,Provider,"Oh, Miss mcintyre what was school life for you."
14727.0,Patient,How was school.
740.0,Provider,Great.
14727.0,Patient,"Well, I moved schools, a lot after my grandma died my girlfriend kept me my mom's mother she kept me in until she passed away when I was seven during school years. because she wanted me to be consistent and after that I, I went to I don't know how many different elementary schools between Stockton late for men tikka. Susan ville I mean i've been I don't know I can't even tell you how many different schools i've been to I went to different high schools and I didn't go to high school for a period of time, because we were in La and my mom just didn't want to enroll enroll us. To so it's yeah my school life was not pleasant I did end up in a. In fifth Grade one of my most memorable things from school I ended up any score I was one of the only white children in the school and it was on the same street we're all the heroin dealing was happening a kindergartener got shot and killed while attending that school. I yeah it had to jump over a brick wall and cross effort way, which is almost like crossing a highway a walk through a park to get to the school, which was where a lot of drug activity happening because it was the street, that the drug activity was on. connect to the park and. You know study it was that is a very memorable experience my. mom had a husband after she left my dad, who was the one who actually was sexually molesting us and I don't know where their grand scheme plan came to accuse my father of it. And you know I mean I know some of the history, now that we were all tested like for sexually transmitted diseases, and my sister and I and my mom and my stepdad Charlie all came back positive for Familia my dad came back negative for everything, but yet he still was the one who was. yeah I was old enough to know I mean I was. Five when my parents split. You know my dad was my everything and losing my dad was very traumatic for me. When my mom and he was split and then losing my dad to suicide, I felt like it was my fault, because it was right after her phone call that I had with him on my birthday my mom was like you're never going to see these girls again, you know I remember that now, but. I didn't remember that for many years, and I remember her forcing me to tell him that I never wanted to see him again in that I didn't love him anymore, and I felt like it because I said that that that was why. He he killed himself. And I lived with that, for I mean I didn't really understand that, until I was almost 40 and i'm 44 that it wasn't my fault."
740.0,Provider,yeah it was masterful because. i'm sure your dad know that mama was crazy and.
14727.0,Patient,that's why he left her yeah i'm sure i'm sure he may be down that.
740.0,Provider,you'd like to be left him in there something was going on in order to be forced to pay pay the to do me.
14727.0,Patient,"I know, and my mom was addicted to heroin and she did what she could make sure you can ever take us from him because he worked every day, and he had a job and he had stability and she was on welfare, and you know what I mean. So she took it from him the way the one way she knew that he couldn't get it back for. hmm and that that's all bentley what took my dad's life from him was not ever being able to have us, and that was through the Court and the weight of what my mom did."
740.0,Provider,When did your mom.
14727.0,Patient,My mom passed when I was 23.
740.0,Provider,And were you ever able to tell her how you fail. None of that.
14727.0,Patient,"No. No, I, I can say I have at me know but 40 years old, I was finally able to come to the conclusion of completely forgiving her. hmm but i'm still very upset and angry with her, where she treated us and. there's still a lot of. stuff or I mean he told my therapist when I met with her on Monday, Tuesday I told her i'm like you know you've been working with me for six years and I haven't even unpacked a fraction of my baggage with you, yet and you've been working with me for six years, so you know. And I mean I told her I said I know I need more right now, and I know that's what i'm trying to do and she's been on board with me trying to do this and. I have a hard time I will not go to county mental health, I refuse to go to county."
740.0,Provider,It will not know that I would be well. I live very far i'm not a cattle for are you.
14727.0,Patient,"yeah. If anybody wants you to work for county mental health, it might drive you more crazy than."
740.0,Provider,Anything i'm that i'm down south. We don't we don't hate it.
14727.0,Patient,"Because i've been county mental health, all the way from I mean from Susan bill to we've rebuilt to me antica to modesto yeah all over California. and none of it has been beneficial everything has it's all been not good all of it. and not one of the psychiatrists and any of the different places ever thought to question whether my diagnosis was correct, it was just like okay you're on on these medications. This is it yeah you got borderline personality disorder good your childhood trauma and Emily when I finally started working into the social work Program. And stuff I was like wait a minute borderline personality disorder doesn't i'm not just me me me me how does that relate to childhood trauma what relates to childhood trauma, you know and. ptsd absolutely you know."
740.0,Provider,"Oh well, we're going to continue to of course we're going to continue to work on it, so you don't even have to where I have a red now if you have been anxiety um any history of suicide ideation homicidal ideation so self harm."
14727.0,Patient,"And the only time I ever felt like harming someone else was when I was on zoloft I really wanted to hurt people okay quickly got myself off of that medication because that's definitely me. Suicide I station, yes, a lot of history with that, when I was on those all those medications."
740.0,Provider,For Jerry. You put you put yourself on mute with Meg attacking him. He put yourself on mute. on me. Okay.
14727.0,Patient,Do you hear me now. yeah okay.
740.0,Provider,Oh sorry carry any Korean thoughts of suicide.
14727.0,Patient,"or in the past few months, I mean i've you know they're fleeting thoughts of cheeses here, maybe the world would be better off without me and. If I just didn't exist, but no new like they're just like fleeting thoughts in a moment and i'm really realizing like what the hell, are you thinking why. Your head oh wait you've got a lot of stress."
740.0,Provider,And Stephen I mean all the record.
14727.0,Patient,You know what I believe questions real pay.
740.0,Provider,"refund because we we almost pressed for time so i'm going to actually question just to make sure, and then we'll keep talking about it so. In the past month on past few months, have you wish, you were there to wish you could go to sleep and I wake up. No okay. Have you ever had any thoughts of killing yourself in the past month over the past few months. No okay. All right."
14727.0,Patient,No Definitely not.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. Well, I mean that's all I need to know. i'm missing major time outside of trauma and anxiety what is something you want to work on why you're here and treatment."
14727.0,Patient,Clever hearing treatment is because I there's a lot that I do. Not trauma.
740.0,Provider,"So now. they're not why in treatment, I said what are some things you want to work on, while you're here in treatment."
14727.0,Patient,"What I would like to there's like i've been with my mom unresolved issues you know there's a lot. With. The mental health stuff there's I have a lot of trouble around that I didn't realize I had that ran so. Deep to my core until I took that mental health class that really threw me off my Rocker which literally was like last semester, before I graduated and. I literally graduated and fell apart i'm like How does this happen, I just graduated with my social work degree, and now I am literally falling to pieces. How does this happen, you know and Emily what has led me here and yeah so I have a lot of stuff I need to unpack with the mental health trauma. and work through it a lot of stuff. A lot of things. Even understanding and in working through the whole I mean I just it's so hard to even understand her father and how someone could have a mindset to do the things like my mom did I don't know I don't know how Could somebody do that if she's not here to question you know."
740.0,Provider,"Sad i'm gonna say this in that regard right because. And this is something that you have the understanding. there. and hopefully this kind of alleviate some of the stress off your mind, because the thing about the is that, even though you've experienced so much trauma in your in your childhood. Even though a lot of things will not fail. A lot of things are misunderstood right that, but the thing about it is that a parent can only raise you based off of how they would raise."
14727.0,Patient,My blood.
740.0,Provider,"No, no, no, no, no i'm not talking about today because. What people fail to realize is that not only do parents raise you, but your environment also have to raise you. You know what you're exposed to also helps right issue you know the same with those things that you that you see on TV but also help to raise you those video games that you play that. So."
14727.0,Patient,So yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And that's how it is and that's what you thought was a takes a village to raise a child. So what is what happens in a village. And what their child is exposed to, but I will say you did something i'm saying something you're not gonna understand why she do she be. You and and the thing about it is even if she could say it's the end of the day, she might not knowing she would just say I was in a bad place, I was using dope you know, and will you use don't you make a decision so that's what I do okay."
14727.0,Patient,"You know, working with. The Harvard education Center here to has helped me to that's why i've been able to fully forgiven but yet with her because i've worked with these people and stuff for six years that come in for home protection services."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
14727.0,Patient,"You know and and right now, this is what I am doing for my harm reduction, because my mental health is not stable."
740.0,Provider,"And the thing about it is, if you don't forgive for her sake, you forgive for your sanity that's the whole point."
14727.0,Patient,Is this okay yep so angry and you.
740.0,Provider,"Do not do not hold no grudges and but see the thing about a yep and the same as this, the same. Because I don't I don't know him as magnetar, but if you say I forgive but they you feel hold emotions from this situation then that's not full forgiveness, does that make sense."
14727.0,Patient,"Daily life better. i've forgiven her for her actions by slowly, given her for help emotionally has affected me. Exactly I hate. That."
740.0,Provider,"Right and so that's that's that's the reason why you are still struggling so much with those emotion is because of the fact that you have my puppet court and say you know what I don't only forgive you for your action, but I also forgive you for how it affected me."
14727.0,Patient,"Today, I can see that's a good thing."
740.0,Provider,"So yeah that's something they're gonna have to work on. It is it is and that's the reason why, because the thing about it is they, you know i'm saying you're still harboring so much. And the crazy part about it is, it is still holding you hostage in that situation is still holding you hostage and so what it is, is that now i'm 44 years old, but i'm still 12 and i'm still seeing. It and i'm feeling man. And i'm fear saving face and facts and so that means i'm still harboring you know i'm saying those emotional thing. You know i'm saying they realize those those those emotional farmers, so one thing to be able to tell somebody has to give you for what you do, however. i'm saying I don't know if I can forgive you based off of. The most effective me emotional."
14727.0,Patient,Right yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah i'm saying, but that's not so we're going to work on total forgive me. Just from her side and your side. Because the thing about it is, is that you know i'm saying and and and, at the end of the day, mom she's not here to answer for her sale."
14727.0,Patient,Good.
740.0,Provider,"directly and then even if even if she was here who's the stage, she holds the same she remember okay don't be real all right. And so, in and and that's what i'm saying a lot your lady boy boy."
14727.0,Patient,"i've been going into the master plan for the master's program for social work to and see these are all things if I if I can't. work through my shit, how can I be present there to work to help somebody else work through there and that's another reason why i'm here."
740.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely. So anything and but it's good that you're in a place. And that you work in an environment that tells you hi he got some issues. wrong with you. Why you act like this. yeah and the thing about it is that people, people are your best mirrors, which means that sometimes when you are faced with people who had been in situations like yours and when they tell you their story being you get triggered and that's I know that something is fear. Or you find yourself in a situation around a person that remind you of somebody who is. Absolutely."
14727.0,Patient,"Right and they be trigger you or like I mean my step dad blue a guy's head off right in front of me because he ripped him off on a dope deal when I was, I think I was like 987 somewhere between there."
740.0,Provider,You know.
14727.0,Patient,"I was still remember that bright light of the gunfire and every fireworks goes off even on fourth of July when i'm expecting it, I still jump every time. So."
740.0,Provider,"it's just and it's the same it's not the fat, and so this is something that you have to understand. Right, because we all have trump we all do."
14727.0,Patient,We all do we're humans. We live in this world.
740.0,Provider,"Everybody had everybody has had some type of trauma right it doesn't matter the pain, or the level of trauma is trauma is not where you know your main event is man, so we can't really considered it to be trump knows. Everybody everybody perceive their trauma different from the other person right, and so the thing about it is that trauma is not. You know i'm saying you're not going to forget it that's not that's not the point of the treatment for the trauma, the point is to be able to live a productive life, in spite of it. They may see."
14727.0,Patient,The positives you could learn to carry with you and.
740.0,Provider,"And the thing about it is as many times, I believe we can either do something. We can either continue to live and resonate and meditate and allow this thing to the straw man and destroy our health and our physical health and mental health and I, and I will be, or we can, or we can say you know why. Listen, it was traumatic i'll never forget it, but it didn't hear me. Now, must be."
14727.0,Patient,But it's like right now somewhere in between those two places and that's why.
740.0,Provider,"You have. And you, but at the same time, you have to look at what all you have now right."
14727.0,Patient,So you say.
740.0,Provider,"You know, you could it ended up like over there were you know under bridge without young Sam but now you gotta you gotta mandy loves you you got kids you got a family of your own so that means didn't take you out right and now."
14727.0,Patient,it's going.
740.0,Provider,To.
14727.0,Patient,Be was to be anything but the woman my mother was.
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I agree. And so that's something that we're going to continue to work on that's the thing about it a lot of times we come to treatment and trauma and then we expect, we expect to be healed that I that."
