126.0,Provider,This is an individual session with Michelle Smith. Hello there.
11666.0,Patient,hi.
126.0,Provider,How are you.
11666.0,Patient,Doing okay.
126.0,Provider,How was your day today.
11666.0,Patient,It was OK.
126.0,Provider,OK so yesterday you seemed really subdued and really like something was bothering you.
11666.0,Patient,yeah I don't know i'm still just. I don't know kind of feeling down and not really feeling myself lately I don't know.
126.0,Provider,Are you trying to do anything to like cheer yourself up you know go out for a walk do something that's. fun.
11666.0,Patient,"I mean, I think about it. I don't know I just like I don't have the. I don't have the motivation to, and you know, like I had said that the last group, like i've not been doing the yoga like I haven't."
126.0,Provider,yeah and that's our big. Help for you. And that could be one of the reasons. you're feeling a little down.
11666.0,Patient,"And I know that it is, I know that plays a big part in it. But i'm still not doing it i'd rather just lay in bed those extra few minutes, then get up and do it. I don't know I can't seem to push through that."
126.0,Provider,"yeah. And you know when it's. When we're not really feeling up to it that's what we really want to do is stay in our comfort zone, we don't want to you know step outside of our comfort zone force ourselves to do anything but sometimes that's, the only way we can get back into our old routine. You know. And, and I totally relate. I used to exercise every day and ride my bike every day and I haven't been doing that. Since Kovac started. And it's like I got to get back out there and it's hard to motivate yourself."
11666.0,Patient,"Is and i'm really the world's worst at starting something. And not sticking with it, but I was doing really well with the yoga though it wasn't really one thing that I actually did stick with and it helps me so much like I just swear by it, because meditating and yoga like it really does help. You guys and I know that, so I don't know why i'm not doing you. Because. I don't like feeling like this, but yeah i'm not doing anything about it."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm. And when you do your yoga do you just do you follow a video or a routine or do you do.
11666.0,Patient,"on YouTube I. Know sometimes though a pass for the past week or so like there's been like just i'll just stop in my lunch break or just stop if i'm just feeling like okay I gotta move. i'll just get up and do it myself. mm hmm but I usually follow a YouTube video even started this um you know this one youtuber that I follow that does yoga has had this 30 day challenge. And I started it and I got to like day nine and then that's where I just. kind of quit with it, but. um I have my office upstairs so I have my desk and all here and then over in the corner, I have my yoga mat and my blocks and I have my home and I love love that I have this setup."
126.0,Provider,You know right. Right and because you're not in the middle of the whole household you're. isolated and segregated you can do your own thing.
11666.0,Patient,"it's something i've never had before, and then i'm not even utilizing it the way that I could be."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11666.0,Patient,I don't know I gotta get it together. I really do.
126.0,Provider,Do you think it's like there's something ongoing that's bothering you or you just think it's just being lazy.
11666.0,Patient,"I don't know. I don't know it could it could be just laziness but then again I. don't know, maybe there's something underlying that i'm not really. I don't know."
126.0,Provider,what's going on with your son she. Keeping on the good path.
11666.0,Patient,"yeah he has been. know he. He there's not been anything you know come up he's been doing really well. I just i'm having some trust issues with him, like every everything is like i'm like i'm really or Is there something more to that. I just don't but he's you know he's kind of lost that trust there's like that's going to take some time to get back, but i'm also trying to it's like I told my husband this morning i'm trying not to not believe. Every like pieces. right because I don't want to."
126.0,Provider,"I don't want him to do, he did yeah and you don't want him to feel like what she doesn't leave anything I say."
11666.0,Patient,"Right, I definitely don't and I think, to an extent, he kind of does you know but i'm trying not to but then again I don't want to be naive either."
126.0,Provider,"And right right. So it's like you have to be vigilant it's like you're always on watch. You know, and it might be easier, just to give him the benefit of the doubt and say hey you know he's he's passed your drug tests that you've given him right yeah let's just give him the benefit of the doubt he's."
11666.0,Patient,"Not doing his chores like. yeah he's not getting allowance this week and i've really been thinking about you know what you said about making the contract out and do. I really need to do that. Or, I really do I haven't done it, yet I need to do that something different, has to happen because yes."
126.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah and you know, and it has to be a time where you know you and your son are comfortable that atmosphere is not. charged or stressed or tense it's like you know hey I got this great suggestion about making a contract let's sit down let's talk about it and you get to have some input to."
11666.0,Patient,mm hmm.
126.0,Provider,"And so, if he feels like he's a part of this he'll be more of a willing participant. Right, you know, like maybe he can say Okay, so if you complete all your your chores in a week. What do you think would be a good. You know reward other than just allowance or money or you know. And maybe let him choose his own reward."
11666.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah yeah that's a good idea, because. You know and they're Nice, I feel like there needs to be something kind of more than just the allowance. And then it's. You know I told him today that you know I hope you know there's various no allowance this week because there's not you've not been doing the chores like you're supposed to. So he asked well, what about the little kids to are they going to lose their allowance to well."
126.0,Provider,that's none of your business.
11666.0,Patient,I I cannot even help them to the same standards. they're and they're seven and eight.
126.0,Provider,Are they being given allowance.
11666.0,Patient,"yeah ensures. But I don't I don't give them nearly as many chores they. may have one or two and they kind of do it together and they may or may not do it, and I really. You know don't push it because they're seven and eight. Right and how will we know. You probably still going to get there, but that's that's because there's there's seven and eight right. You know it's it's not even really necessary."
126.0,Provider,"it's not happy it's not comparing apples to apples that's. Right, but you know it's siblings don't. Think of that they don't think of the age thing. I know, with my own daughter my older daughter is six years older than my younger daughter. And my older daughter who's now 37 she in her memories she did all the work she did all the chores and her younger sister did nothing. Well Okay, but when when she was the older daughter was seven or eight or nine years old and had chores the younger daughter was a baby. Right one or two or three you don't give a three year old chores so it's so funny in her mind her younger sister never had chores but, of course, she did right, but in their minds, they they don't think of the age difference. No. You know it's like they just want everybody to be treated equally and."
11666.0,Patient,"The right. And it is here. If you see. And I think he does, probably feel like they get treated differently, which they do, but that's not what that's because of the age difference right or they're younger it's not, as you know, they get. treated better."
126.0,Provider,"Right, but in his mind in his mind that's what's happening yeah yeah so he needs to know that you know the older, you are, the more chores you get. Older you are, the more responsibilities, you get and, if you want to hang out with your friends or go out or do anything your chores has to be done. The little kids don't have don't hang out with anybody. So they have a different set of rules. And you got the B boy rules they got the little kid rules."
11666.0,Patient,"So they're not really getting they're not really getting as much in return, either."
126.0,Provider,And the money probably doesn't even mean much to them either.
11666.0,Patient,No.
126.0,Provider,"I don't really care about the money. it's kind of interesting but yeah kids are like that they'll always compare them themselves. And it's interesting because, always with the oldest kids the parents are more strict and as they as they start having more and more kids the younger kids end up being you know you're less strict with the younger kids."
11666.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. I yeah I know with him with him when he was you know, and he was a baby when I was pregnant, when I was born, I was like it was my first kid you know. My first pregnancy first everything was. Everything had to be exactly the way they said, it should be in a magazine, I read. That was the second to and of. course my second one came, seven years later, so at that. Point I was like."
126.0,Provider,yeah. Whatever that's a whole new ballgame by then.
11666.0,Patient,"And he says he says he mentions that a lot, you know when I was their age. I would have never gotten away with that I haven't. been able to do that, it would have been differently yeah it was it really was, but you know who."
126.0,Provider,"That is exactly how. How it happens, you know your first one you're always strict with and you're kind of tentative and you're not sure how to be a parent and the rules to enforce and by the time you have two or three or four kids like. And I tell him I tell him."
11666.0,Patient,"Well, I didn't make any difference, so you know i'm not going to stress over those things."
126.0,Provider,Because we.
11666.0,Patient,are still 15 with an attitude and entitled and. So yeah obviously making you eat all your vegetables and all of those extra little things I was so stressed about did a matter.
126.0,Provider,"yeah. I remember my older sister would get so mad at everything that my parents would let me do, but they didn't let her do, and in those days back way back when you know girls used to wear nylons to school. And a lot of girls were not allowed to wear nice socks they had to wear nylons. And so my sister had to wear nylons to school, by the time I went to school you're allowed to it, I mean we had all these stupid girls always had to wear dresses were not allowed to wear pants to school. And when it finally when all those rules changed, you know, and you didn't have to wear stockings you could wear knee socks oh my older sister would just. pitch a bitch you never allowed me to do and it's like you know what life changes things change rules change, you know and the the older siblings always compare themselves with the younger ones. What they can do what they can't do. You know, one day, my older daughter, said to me, I feel like a slave So what do you mean I do all the work and coral does nothing, and this was her biggest complaint when we go to the store you tell me to push the shopping cart that makes me feel like a slave."
11666.0,Patient,"i'm telling you I got the same thing. No my my son actually went and moved to Washington state was his dad because he said I treated him like a slave. few years back, he he did he went to to stay at his dad's over the weekend and then he calls me and says i'm not going to come back. i'm staying with my dad because I feel like you treat me like a slave I have to do the dishes all the time because he's chores because of his chores yes, yes I treat him like a slave i'm abusing him. Because he has responsibilities."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm mm hmm. And how long did that last him staying with his dad.
11666.0,Patient,"No, I mean he has he did live with his dad for a year, so at one point."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11666.0,Patient,"But you know he he was a baby eight seven or eight and he wanted he wanted to live with his dad and I felt like you know, of course I didn't want him to, and I really didn't think that it was the best thing, but I wanted him to. be able to make that decision and there really wasn't any reason for him not to so. He did, but then you know his grade started falling and it just was and then then his dad got into a whole situation and it's just wasn't. It was it wasn't like a good. thing anymore, so we stopped at."
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, at least you let them try it and see how."
11666.0,Patient,"See how well I I. kind of went through something like that, when I was younger, you know my parents divorced, and I felt torn I felt like I had to be you know dad's fan around dad and not like mom and then. right with mom I felt like I had to oh yeah I don't like yeah we don't like him and I felt torn between the two and i've never wanted him to feel that way so. You know and we've always kept a good relationship. Because you know I make a point to in his and his wife and. I just feel like I mean do I, like them no but we keep a good relationship, because I don't I don't want I don't want that for him if he's already experiencing that enough. it's just how it is. Man, I know, when he goes to visit over Christmas it's going to be, you know he's going to feel this cousins and he's gonna. want to you know he's gonna want he's going to be blessed it which I want him to be, and I know he's gonna feel like he wants to stay and I am always kind of afraid that he's going to do that again. You know i'm not coming back."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11666.0,Patient,But that's never gonna happen.
126.0,Provider,yeah that's that that's not gonna fly.
11666.0,Patient,"No, but it does. And I know that it's just how it is he hasn't seen his dad in a while and he's gonna go and he's gonna feel like Oh, I want to stay here, and I know that that's how it is, and I wish that he didn't have to feel that way. But it's just how it is."
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm and where does this devil of. intimacy oh OK. So he gets to go there for Christmas for how long two weeks two weeks well and, of course, then you go visiting your family during the holidays it's a honeymoon it's not real life."
11666.0,Patient,"No and but see he doesn't he doesn't realize that and I, I think, maybe over this last time you know when he. He did maybe realized that it did seem good at the moment, but then after he was there and seeing like that's still doing the same thing and it's not really what it's all cracked up to be and. yeah yeah but yeah here it's it's chores and homework and school and you know. i'm constantly on you about getting the food out of your room and you know those type of things in there it's not it. Like like you said it's not real life."
126.0,Provider,yeah. yeah it's a vacation it's a vacation exactly exactly and they probably tend to him and let him do whatever he wants and.
11666.0,Patient,Most and definitely do. Whatever he wants.
126.0,Provider,"Now, did they have other kids."
11666.0,Patient,They have one two year old.
126.0,Provider,"Okay, not like somebody has HIV can hang out with her anything."
11666.0,Patient,"No, but he has his cousins, though there are five of them and they just moved back from Florida they're all about the same age between 13 and 617 17. So he's really excited about that and i'm so glad you didn't get to see them."
126.0,Provider,"Nice Nice. And you were you were kind of talking a couple weeks ago about you really wanted to go back to Tennessee for the holidays and visit, do you think that's kind of like hanging over your head making you feel a little melancholy, the fact that you're not going back to visit."
11666.0,Patient,"yeah probably I mean, I think it has a lot to do with being homesick in. You know. I am, I think it has a lot to do with that. Because. You know I don't have anything here. I don't have anything here. and Every day i'm reminded of it is i'm just here. By myself."
126.0,Provider,"yeah and you can keep doing your work every day in your House in your room close job without you know somehow breaking the monotony with you know hanging out with friends or you know. i'm just thinking, what about would your husband be willing to you know kind of stay home with the kids for the weekend and you just go to Tennessee by yourself, for a weekend."
11666.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
126.0,Provider,"I mean, think about that that might be something that you know, maybe you really need to see your family. And you know, even if it's a short visit yeah. Just to be able to go there, you know see your mom who else who else is there that. You really."
11666.0,Patient,And my my best friend that's that's pretty much it my mom and her but. You know that's that's what I have. it's not here so.
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. And you know I don't think that's a that I don't think that's a selfish thing I think you deserve it, I think. that's something that. will definitely help you and boost your morale in the long run, maybe get you back on track. You know i'm just kind of trying to figure out what is it that's making you kind of fall out of your general routine, especially when you know that that routine is good for you and it works. You know so something is something's there in your head that's kind of. preventing you from. Seeing the big picture, I think."
11666.0,Patient,I definitely think it would help.
126.0,Provider,"I mean, of course, you, you know don't want to be away from your kids too long, but. You know, maybe I don't know Maybe you can fly out there with your son just plan on staying over the weekend. and come back by yourself."
11666.0,Patient,yeah possibly kid.
126.0,Provider,"I mean you could you could maybe take off a day or something one day on Friday, and you know, maybe your husband would take off the day on Friday, and you know he can stay with the kids Friday Saturday and Sunday and come back Sunday night."
11666.0,Patient,I know.
126.0,Provider,"But I think that would be really, really beneficial for you, especially because you have no friends there. You have no outlet."
11666.0,Patient,There yeah.
126.0,Provider,"it's. Just your jobs, I mean not your jobs your kids job, and I mean other than going shopping when do you leave out."
11666.0,Patient,That that's it.
126.0,Provider,that's terrible. yeah.
11666.0,Patient,That I know variable. And I rarely do that.
126.0,Provider,"wow. I don't know think about it, I think that would be a huge boost to your morale and I think it would really kind of help you because you're. You know you're like you know you're homesick and. that's so funny because i've never been homesick in my life and me and my sisters, we would go to summer camp every year for two weeks sleepaway summer camp every year for two weeks, and all the other girls here would be this my buddies and we would make fun of them. And bully them, I mean. We were. horrible we, in effect, my sister got hurt she I don't know she she fell and she hurt her knee was just bleeding and they wanted to send her home and she was. telling them get my sister get my sister so finally they came and got me and they said over calling your parents to come pick Nancy up because she hurt herself and Nancy was going to send me home, and I said, you know what she doesn't need to go home, I mean she bed, not to go home."
11666.0,Patient,mm hmm.
126.0,Provider,"We were just the opposite, we were like we don't want to be at home, we want to. be here at Camp we were such troublemakers have to separate all three of us be. They they never put us in the same unit."
11666.0,Patient,"Again, because we're troublemakers."
126.0,Provider,"We would come home every year, so horse we couldn't talk for two weeks. That made my mom very happy to."
11666.0,Patient,"Oh well, that's that's really funny because I actually only went to Camp once and it was in the fourth grade and it. was for. horrible I hated it I. hated it, I was so so shy. And I. Just I just couldn't it was too much perfect."
126.0,Provider,yeah just wow. And how many how many days was it.
11666.0,Patient,"It was a week. Oh, it was four H camp yeah."
126.0,Provider,Oh OK OK.
11666.0,Patient,"It was horrible I mean they hit the refund things, and it could have been it could have been great, but I was just I was such a shy and timid child, it was just."
126.0,Provider,"Not your cup of tea at all. So that that's one of the things i'm totally grateful for is that me and my sisters were in girl scouts my mom was the troop leader, we would go camping every other weekend we went to summer camp every year and. Basically, that was our escape from the House my my dad was crazy raging alcoholic and so, thank God, my mom became a troop leader, because that's what got us out of the House so basically anytime we were away from home, we were happy. It was going back home that was like no we don't want to go home."
11666.0,Patient,"yeah I know I can relate to that I don't know why I wouldn't have enjoyed being away because I was kind of the same way yeah for me, but it wasn't even that I was away from home, though. Because really between that agent the time I was 18 I I really, really stayed at home as soon as I was, you know I stayed and stayed with friends, more than anything. It was just being somewhere with a bunch of people I didn't I."
126.0,Provider,don't know.
11666.0,Patient,"I just really hope I try to push my kids to do things like that, so that they don't you know they don't I don't want them to be shy like that. I missed out on so much. my childhood, because I was so shy, and you know such an introvert and I want them to be outgoing and. yeah."
126.0,Provider,You do things like that yeah. All right man well i'm gonna let you go. and think about the the holiday get away yeah you deserve it yeah. I think it would be like a shot of medicine for you yeah.
11666.0,Patient,"I think, so too."
126.0,Provider,"All right. Well, you think about it and we'll we'll talk again all right all right. Take care. Okay bye."
