12920.0,Patient,hi.
214.0,Provider,How are you.
12920.0,Patient,what's going on.
214.0,Provider,i'm trying to i'm trying to get onto your chart real quick.
12920.0,Patient,So you know.
214.0,Provider,Oh so. Here we go. So. Were you seen this before me.
12920.0,Patient,"I was seeing two so like the first one, I saw her for one session and then all the sudden they just signed a new one, so I have no idea what happened, why. And then I saw another therapists maybe like two sessions and then my where I started working so, and the only time she had available was just like didn't work with my time. So that's why we switched because this is perfect time slots for me."
214.0,Provider,"I just need to look at something, because I know nothing about."
12920.0,Patient,that's.
214.0,Provider,Right it's really not I had some Internet issues I couldn't get on ahead of time to figure stuff out. I want to see if I can be helped it. Is what I see him what was what cannot we're all right so. Who is your prescriber. Ah.
12920.0,Patient,But.
214.0,Provider,"Now I get it, but like I don't have the attention span should she had asked me to take you on."
12920.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"well. i'm just going to go on, sometimes I see my bad so. My assumption is, we have some difficulties or no one I have difficulties on focus concentration tasks assignments."
12920.0,Patient,"For the most part. When did you make those, why did you make those."
214.0,Provider,funny when you did that.
12920.0,Patient,"um cuz you're a guy so put your medical provider so i'm sure you're like it's not the first time it's just like certain times of the month, it doesn't work as effectively. that's."
214.0,Provider,To be I.
12920.0,Patient,"need to do, but."
214.0,Provider,"The idea, though, is to, if I may, the idea would be to understand what the pre and post deficits are So what are the, what are the impacts before there's always going to be impact storing and what are the impacts post for. Every female they're usually very different."
12920.0,Patient,uh huh.
214.0,Provider,But knowing it kind of makes it easier to I get to I guess to be in acceptance.
12920.0,Patient,"yeah I mean like for me, I think it's mainly like when I have PMs because, like normally. I would, and my memory is not the best but i'd say like normally like one or two days before. I will the way I put it is like I start to question everything in my life Oh, I need to change my job I need to change everything about my life is wrong and then i'm like okay it's not really a thing I need to do it's just my mood is changing. But with the meds it's like I noticed, I felt extremely tired and the other day I even got kind of how do I put this. I just got like one moodier than normal, but I was able to maintain like you know self control and not like get too spicy shall I say, but I was just like not as cooperative as I normally am. And so what I did was I ended up. I just didn't take it like for like one of the days, just to see how I felt and I have enough structures in place right now so where I was fine I got a lot done even on the day that I wasn't taking meds and I was fine. I have a very structured schedule, I make myself get up early I shouldn't say like that I like I enjoy getting up really early in the morning to exercise, before I start work because it helps me focus so like that's really helped my sleep them as you're helping my sleep but anyway. But I just you know I literally like I started this new job like like a month and a half ago, and I just told my. Colleague I said look she's a woman, I said I get kind of my brain gets foggy I know my work is not as I make more mistakes as what happens like I just start to make more mistakes. But to what the good thing is because I already know that's going to happen, I just asked for extra support and I just take my time on things and I don't expect myself to work as quickly."
214.0,Provider,So. you're not making excuses you're making modifications.
12920.0,Patient,"yeah I just take more time to you know, and I do a lot like I do a lot of things to. Like because I know that exercises helps I exercise every single morning just because i'm like Okay, if I do that if I do X y&z and do all these things I did all the things I can do to control what I can control and that's that's about as much as I can do."
214.0,Provider,"That you are setting the tone for the day right so for happy happy moods or happy. So that there's right, you have the four happy. seven times acetone and there's two other time, and so what you're doing is you're cultivating a structure in which your day starts off strong by a reward system of some sort. And then, it provides you an easier. Transition throughout the day i'm assuming."
12920.0,Patient,"I mean I love exercising very much and I and it's like I never put it together that it had to do if I mean I think all humans are supposed to exercise right, but I think with ADHD it's just like it helps with focus it helps to get it, especially if it's right in the morning."
214.0,Provider,"cuz. it's regimen regimen is what likes and ADHD because it's very difficult to implement and most times, people like I want to be structured, I want to be diligent. Putting that together in a spreadsheet or enough flow chart is very, very."
12920.0,Patient,"Well, I."
214.0,Provider,Totally get that.
12920.0,Patient,"what was happening for me was before, so I was on I was on Ritalin first, which was like mostly fine, except that I couldn't sleep, which is. Which is not great right because you can't take it consistently only once in a while adderall was like not I couldn't sleep at all, so what happened was I got to a point where I was like why events might not work out for me because I hadn't tried it yet, and I just said. I had this conversation myself where it's like I don't feel good I feel kind of like mildly depressed and I was like. Okay let's figure out what was what was I doing before and I was like I stopped exercising for like a month because you have a back injury. And so my chiropractor doesn't want me weightlifting or doing so anyway, when story is I figured out like I couldn't bicycle and there's certain things I can do that doesn't hurt my back. And so I just started doing it because I was like i'm tired of feeling like I don't want to feel like this, I want to feel happy. So. You know, and I just had this theory that like if I got up before work to do it that maybe that would be better so it's been it's been really nice too because, like when I get up in the morning, I like no one else's awake it's like my time so. I feel special so."
214.0,Provider,So I looked at your depression size in your anxiety squads the very lowest that i'm the one feel.
12920.0,Patient,"Right now, or just in general. Well, I had let me think about the depends on how far back you want to go, but I would say."
214.0,Provider,"let's do it this way. This way, instead of me trying to communicate it, we have a visual look so this is your survey right here. All right, and this survey says it's a for minimum depression and then seven it's it's my oldest."
12920.0,Patient,One for last 30.
214.0,Provider,This is the one from your last mission words. I thought.
12920.0,Patient,Oh yeah that was yesterday um yeah.
214.0,Provider,So let's let's go on this. let's see what August provides us. He and i'm still single digits there isn't.
12920.0,Patient,A big.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i'm trying to get out is I mean mood is always a factor, just because that's what. gets us to our moods but are you finding depression, anxiety to be anything that you need to worry about or."
12920.0,Patient,"Not necessarily mean I think it's. it's gotten better like cuz so what happened was when I first came in, I had a breakup like maybe, five, six months ago and it was pretty bad like I was very depressed at the time and. I just like needed to like grieve I think and do some things for myself, because I wasn't even diagnosed yet and. I think what I would say at this point, depression really isn't I don't really feel depressed most of time I think what I feel sometimes is just like a little bit anxious sometimes about. i'm trying to think of a way to say this. I feel like i'm behind in life right, and I think that's probably pretty common like in at with ADHD because I feel like Oh, I want to be doing so much more than what i'm doing right now, and so. I feel like the meds of health and to the extent that, like it's kind of made my self esteem, a little bit better like I I i'll talk to myself, like. that's Okay, I know you feel overwhelmed but we'll be able to do this, we can do this we'll figure it out and before I started picking as I think I was more like I don't know how i'm going to do this, you know so it's definitely. But I definitely have like a very optimistic personality so. So this."
214.0,Provider,"is so this breakup, and again I am very respectful and very ginger and when i'm working with people I see something here, and what I see is something I don't understand what you just said something so one of your diagnosis was ptsd. You know that."
12920.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so you will some people be like I didn't know I had that but my point being is, you said you had a bad breakup is that related to the ptsd."
12920.0,Patient,"I mean not well, I mean. I don't know how to answer that I mean it's it's maybe kind of but no, so I was so I was like no with ptsd a long, long time ago i've been in therapy, like most of my adult life."
214.0,Provider,Curry do you have reoccurring dreams know.
12920.0,Patient,"every once in a while i'll still have like dreams about things, but they're not. they're not as disturbing as they used to be so once in a blue moon I might have one but they're not like. i've just done so much for calling myself but. mean it's like oh yeah so it's not is that what you're sorry you're."
214.0,Provider,"So what i'm what i'm trying to do is figure out how to gingerly. Because you already know, I know nothing and i'm trying to groom myself to figure out what is the ptsd and I can't see it so. There is a piece about dv is that the ptsd."
12920.0,Patient,it's what sorry I didn't catch that.
214.0,Provider,Domestic violence is that the ptsd.
12920.0,Patient,"So it was in my childhood, I had. I was abused as a kid and then I did get into about friendship relationship ended all quite a while ago, and since then my relationships have been much, much healthier so it's like they're not perfect, yet I mean i'll never be perfect, but. Why not why. yeah go ahead."
214.0,Provider,"What was your ultimate thought of several people like right, this is about you, when you go buy shoes, you know it's looking for your comfortability you know the occasion, so what are you thinking about it because you've been bounced around. For a minute here so i'm trying to see like what is it that we should work on what is it that my specific can provide you in an ancillary spice to be helpful right to to be to improve the quality of life that's what i'd like to see so i'd like to hear what you think that maybe."
12920.0,Patient,"yeah I mean like I I think there's a lot of different things right, but I think and they all kind of work together, I think, right now, i'm. The main things that I try to i'm trying to figure out is like a I know with ADHD like we like to we want to do all the things and just getting like some real estate goals is always like really nice, because I think. For instance, like right now i'm working full time i'm also like starting to do health coaching like freelance on the side, but I also would like to start dating again and i'm just like that seems like too many things. So it's nice to have another like have support where someone can say I think you're trying to do too many things, I think you need to like you know kind of help you figure out sort of like. What Ellis stick."
214.0,Provider,shade too many things we.
12920.0,Patient,myself.
214.0,Provider,"So. Whenever and that's a great question because the question really is. Nothing you lead. Sentences I hope in some would say you're doing too much, I mean look at it from a different standpoint segment on enough here's my point. yeah we. don't want to what I did here was the passion for what you want, because I want to do a million things I don't have a passion for my passion for certain things i'm wondering if that's. A change of the Channel, but like if we were to add passion into with it automatically help us it's just the effort in time we put into it right."
12920.0,Patient,I think.
214.0,Provider,there's no past. We doing it.
12920.0,Patient,"I think for me it's like. it's just like maintaining a balance, because I definitely have passion like I have worked with a job coach for like something like three years or so. To try it because I have always wanted to like i've been wanting to start my own business for a while, but it's scary like and it's a lot but. I put a lot of time and energy into it and I do like the idea of doing health coaching but it's also like I don't want to go down to. To talk too much about that i'm just saying that, like, I really enjoy it and I have like one client right now and she's awesome and it's really fun. Night job is like pays the bills, you know don't get me wrong it's a good job it's worked for moments, you know people I work with they're cool but I don't really want to do this kind of job long term I know."
214.0,Provider,"there's an expiration but see now now you're embarking on. Certain ports this port is only going to you know provide me X and I need to leave this port to go to another port, because my vision is in this pilot it'll be more fruitful so you're starting to define. Only whether you know you're doing too many things, how do you simply have a balance so when I talked to people about balances they show them a child, I think it was next time. And the child is divided by eight slices and i'll see so Tommy tell me where you're the most strongest that people will name it and then there'll be three or four other than that. And then i'll save the people do take life is a 5050 pounds most people's reaction on where that's our first mistake is not a 5050 balance large is a balance of. 10 in 20 1517 it changes per hour and what we find is if we think we can maintain a balance work life balance, where we need to realize this, where are the adjustments so all the areas of the pie are performing almost at the same level, so if I give too much attention. it's it's just if I give too much attention to my career than my personal life or finding a significant."
12920.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"So when I show the pie that people can relate to the slices by saying Oh, I see what you mean we have to figure out how to divide even we've divided, even when we actually get more from life, it can we need to target one specifically if we just stay in one slice can get to me."
12920.0,Patient,"that's exactly what i'm saying, though, because, like and then with the relationship piece i'll just say that my last. therapists that I was with like for an extensive period of time we did em Dr she's amazing she's just amazing and we ended up ending because she was like. I can't really help you anymore like i've taken you as far as I can take you, you need to like start looking at like a relationship therapist which I remember being like. So you know what I mean like so I know that I have like certain like attachment style stuff and i'm working through that too in a program which I told Mary about but it's like. that's that's another thing i'm working toward where it's like I think i've gone back and forth on that too, because at first it was like exciting, I was like Well, this is so cool i'm going to learn about myself and then after a certain point, like you said I was just like I am so. I think the thing I feel at this point, right now is i've been working on myself for so long that it's like when is it going to be time for me to just like not have to do that, you know it's I mean, I know I have to keep working myself."
214.0,Provider,But it's nice person. This is happening.
12920.0,Patient,it's just frustrating.
214.0,Provider,"Listen you couldn't have said it better. Here, is why I like providing people that portion like what do you want to do and and people say to me i've been doing this for a decade and really I don't think I moved much. And then I say okay well wait a minute, but what hasn't been foretold what hasn't been tried what hasn't been discussed right. Those are the areas I probably should embark in because every P, in itself, is is an assembly line you get to again go back to the phone again there's really nothing different in the whole assembly line, other than somebody bring in some ancillary support, so I mean, I think. In in our discussion we. decided to address balance passion importance bring in three criteria is to establish why we need to spend time somewhere, we may find it easier to say you know what I need to let this go and I should embark more here."
12920.0,Patient,"yeah I mean that's that's kind of where I am right now, because for a while I was even thinking of like. Just not dating at all and just being like i'm just going to but then like you're saying it's like eventually it's like things get out of balance, like, I can only be focused on my career, because then i'm the my there's my family and my friends and."
214.0,Provider,Like you said it's like.
12920.0,Patient,"they're all important and it's like you know it just it just becomes like you don't feel fulfilled fulfilled in life if you're just neglecting all like, if I have it right."
214.0,Provider,"yeah. that's why it's important to look at that pizza pie, because if we can talk about it, but when we visualize and most people put most of their energy into Korea and then there's financial and then i'm like where's your social on. Why, you have a social life. Because you're too busy over here. And there may watch him why someone is religion. or spirituality you know and that's a whole nother discussion. or health wise, where I like and I, you know I do a lot of like relationship therapy and i'm like so where's your balance well i'm always doing something in this person's not a separate that may be the balance like. When you let someone do everything you don't say nothing. We have either a boundary issue or this person feels inadequate and they feel they need to do everything we need to give them buddy. You have to juggle it all you have to be able to throw the balls up and keep moving and let's just concentrate on one, I think the dating for us, I mean I definitely understand the past and maybe some of the young vr things that went on, but I would save that ultimately you're not looking. to walk the earth, or have enjoyment, or have bad times by the self."
12920.0,Patient,Defense.
214.0,Provider,"wisdom fit. What where does it fit. So I think we. can do well together, I just think we need to. I would look at it, as although it's therapy we kind of need to look at it like a business plan in a flow chart. what's overlapping this now."
12920.0,Patient,yeah great.
214.0,Provider,"You know, we we've tried this before many take it off like keep excluding excluding excluding and then we get to this room and then what we do is we nourish to route when we start to grow from it, and I think that's what would be helpful to you."
12920.0,Patient,yeah yeah I mean like and then the other thing is like obviously kind of all part of it is like learning how to I just want to be organized enough to be able to reach my goals you know it's that's pretty much good that's good enough for me.
214.0,Provider,"The problem is that the problem is that when you when you see things like that right, not that i'm saying that saying you haven't been assessed, it could be an executive executive function issue this call. executive function issues and ADHD Austin get miss diagnose executive function is losing track of time losing track of appointments if there's a lot of mirroring, obviously, but the problem that I find is we'll come up with a plan. Whether it's a spreadsheet plan a yellow sticky plan a color plan, whatever the plan is and people will do it, and then they feel like okay I don't need to do this anymore. And then they hit the stumbling block."
12920.0,Patient,And yeah.
214.0,Provider,Back in an organized and it becomes a problem again so it's a bomb working out every morning that's really what.
12920.0,Patient,"that's and that's i'm saying it's like I i've realized that like it's become. Like even when okay so even for everything my life so right now, where I live, I live with two roommates and they both have ADHD which is like hilarious to me because it's just totally by accident, but just to keep the House clean, we have to have like a chart and everybody has. been in for me it's really nice because all I do is I like I know what my chores or every week I don't even have to think about it it's like. Okay, and then I have like I have my week kind of planned out, you know already like ahead of time, I know what I have to do something so. that's."
214.0,Provider,"All that's having that. that's having that index card per se use the over and over and over and over and over again, and then it becomes structure it becomes conditioning and then it gets implemented but. It has to be this. Chronic routine and some people find it difficult, I don't think this is as difficult as the gaming is really difficult I think it's how we approach, it can be a solution based or it can make things work."
12920.0,Patient,So I think why don't you.
214.0,Provider,"know if we just go with some of the things you've inputted to me, I think I can be pretty beneficial to going forward so you are listed here as seeing a therapist twice a month. So I know i'm going to be the first one to tell you this tire so they're telling me that you have to do urine drug screens. You haven't done one yet don't."
12920.0,Patient,"know I mean they just took my they did a blood test on me when I first came in, but I don't I guess it didn't have a drug screening it as part of it."
214.0,Provider,"Are you a Tony because I know the other therapists and address it's the schedule to it's a drug it's a narcotic and then needs to be monitored we're not saying you're doing anything wrong. It just needs to be monitored I don't want to get a cup in the mail and you'd be like you know this guy didn't even have the decency to tell me, this was gonna happen, I want to be very transparent and what we do. And i'm ultimately in this conversation. So what these work best for you."
12920.0,Patient,"To do it, so if I want to come in you're saying."
214.0,Provider,see it says you're supposed to see me twice a month.
12920.0,Patient,"Oh well, I already have an appointment with you coming up next not this it's like Wednesday at five. 810 27 yeah that's not the not this coming Wednesday with the following one."
214.0,Provider,So i'm gonna already prepped for the things that we discuss and then let's see how it moves forward okay.
12920.0,Patient,So for the for for the drug screen do I just put a quest or.
214.0,Provider,"How does know so Cup is going. To be sent the House. Okay it'll it'll look like an Amazon packets don't get excited to. comes from it comes from, most people ripping open and then it's no good at that point so you'll take it you sell kids from Brian hi it's me Tommy your call up the virtual clinic assembly do my drugs. Okay, open the envelope in. front of us. And shows hasn't been used you go to the restroom you come back to say we need to see the temperature on it, and we need to see. You know all what is so there's it's a drug panels, you know it's when alcohol marijuana it's going to come up for him for them it's supposed to you're taking one but they. just want to make sure. That we're maintaining what would prescribe that's what the purpose of the jobs."
12920.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
214.0,Provider,"And so i'll put a note in that that'll probably take a minute, and she get there before we see each other on the 27."
12920.0,Patient,"that's fine and then I already let Mary know this, but just for you know to that, I do take CBD oil to sleep at night so and it has thc in it i'm just telling you right now, because. we're so I might have."
214.0,Provider,You know i'm guessing thc to so i'm assuming you're doing that because of pain.
12920.0,Patient,sleep I I have trouble sleeping.
214.0,Provider,"Soon, to see me out is it working for you."
12920.0,Patient,"yeah I just take one dropping puts me to sleep. I mean, I have, I was before I started taking it before I started taking meds so I maybe I don't know if I keep me to keep taking it or not now what's another word."
214.0,Provider,"Anything that's working I wouldn't change it could offset the apple cart to my wisdom, I appreciate just boasting i'm not critical I will have I could have a professional discussion about what I want to do is, this is not what needs to be addressed, this is not an impact it doesn't. or impacting you in your everyday life, the other one is really how did, how did you get more towards wherever you're in the losses and that's all I want to work on, but I thank you for that."
12920.0,Patient,uh huh.
214.0,Provider,"And so, then i'll see you on the 27th."
12920.0,Patient,"Okay, and Okay, I know you need to go really quick so once the cup comes, how do I just need to do it like that day basically."
214.0,Provider,"For you, you don't need to do it that day but they're going to know when it when it was dropped off in your mailbox so you should do within three four days of vegetables."
12920.0,Patient,Okay okay that's plenty of time and I just want to make sure so.
214.0,Provider,yeah no you're good cool.
12920.0,Patient,"alrighty all right we'll see in a couple. In two weeks, thank you."
214.0,Provider,you're welcome bye bye.
