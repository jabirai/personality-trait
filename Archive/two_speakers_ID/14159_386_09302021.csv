14159.0,Patient,"um it wasn't a lab it was a it was a at home, I haven't made lab, yet they sent the labs to Mayo and i'm still waiting for that, so I think you can probably still waiting for that as well."
386.0,Provider,"yeah they marked it as you're pregnant as of August 31 and here in our chart that's what it's marked as so. Okay, just need some type of clear reason of why we're taking model therapy and then I have i've had a first Food and Drug is your current home pharmacy."
14159.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
386.0,Provider,they're the best I really like you know for.
14159.0,Patient,"um I I typically do the hand up right here so much, but."
386.0,Provider,"i'm. i'm ready let's pull it up here. Alright, I currently have you enrolled in our program for opioid use disorder and it looks like you, are being seen on a weekly basis, and that is on Tuesdays with Isaiah cruise Is that correct."
14159.0,Patient,"Yes, and I didn't try to get into that the whole day that that whole hour never was London so okay."
386.0,Provider,let's see what they marked it out as. The yeah so on the. On the 28 they marked it as a no show so definitely if you checked in for that group did that can I talk to you at all.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah I did I checked in and I checked in twice, because they sent me over, and then I waited and waited and it just like it kept getting later I was like. 10 past 120 past one, so I hung up and rechecked in again and they're like Oh well, you're gonna be late send me over again waited waited waited by that time it was like 141 45 so. So I do yeah."
386.0,Provider,"I would definitely um you don't have to do it today, but I would definitely reach out to the care navigation team to see what they're able to do to remove the no Shell okay. If you were there, but it is marked as a no show, with it being marked as a no show what it's doing is that it's popping in that you've had multiple no shows in the last 15 days and multiple over the last 30 days. And it says patient has not attended appointment in the last seven days, which is understandable if they didn't let you in. So it says, reduce the prescription to a two day supply, with no additional refills patient must attend an appointment to get an extended prescription order. On the secondary prescription recommendation is to reduce the prescription order to a four day supply with the secondary prescription to bridge to your next appointment and that's for a bps evaluation, and so the bps evaluation, you have scheduled tomorrow. I can do a series of different things here for you, what I can do is I can get you a bridge, and I can get you a bridge out for four days supply Okay, I can override the two days I can get it out for a four day supply, but if you don't go to tomorrow's bps evaluation that secondary."
14159.0,Patient,worker in.
386.0,Provider,"That tomorrow's appointment is schedule 10 one of 2021 and it says 8am, but let me double check if it's Eastern standard if they actually did it the correct way so it's 11am your local time Eastern standard time."
14159.0,Patient,11 tomorrow okay. Oh yeah they're just going to call and check in and they'll pull me over where I need to go right.
386.0,Provider,"yeah you just go into the navigation vc and say I need to go to my bps evaluation, it is scheduled, so I recommend logging in a half an hour to 15 minutes prior to 11 o'clock. Okay, that way there's no way that they can say oh patient didn't show up. Or do anything okay um so always recommend trying logging in prior to the meetings. What I can do is I can bridge it for four days, with an additional refill for you, if you don't if, by any chance, something POPs in and you don't go to the bps evaluation that additional four day bridge will get placed in cancelled out okay. And just have to make sure we're seeing you some way or another."

I asked her approximately what time is going to be ready for you, for pickup she said, give us 30 to 40 minutes and I said okay. So I would definitely I don't know that 30 to 40 minutes, I mean it's getting kind of late there and I don't want you to be in withdrawal overnight, so I would call the pharmacy to say hey. i'm pregnant i'm currently in withdrawal, I need to pick this up as soon as possible, I did, let them know that to let them know like hey this is kind of urgent, but I don't know how quickly they're going to be able to respond without you calling okay.
