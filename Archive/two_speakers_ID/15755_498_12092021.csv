498.0,Provider,How do you feel about engaging with therapy with bright heart. Because the medication is only going to do so much.
15755.0,Patient,"But medicaid yeah yeah. We talked I talked to that I talked about that with Sharon and yeah like i've always told every side characters that i've been through and i've been through a lot. Of psychiatrists you know I would love, just to be off of it but yeah I wouldn't have no life, you know I mean I don't want to take medication, I want to be normal like anybody else you know, or you know there's. Just I don't I don't want to be the way that I am you know it's scary the way I live, I mean I pretty much haven't done anything my whole entire life because of my disorder so. I mean it helps me do little things here in their work and stuff like that, but I need to do, but like long trips and stuff like that. It you know it's not not good, I mean i'll be calling an ambulance like I told Sharon i've called like over 1920 ambulances within my lifetime so just to take me to the hospital. So."
498.0,Provider,So.
15755.0,Patient,"Fake you know it helps me, but like she said, you know I shouldn't be having any attacks which she is correct, on that I shouldn't be having any and I still do have some you know every occasionally you know, but not very, very you know big tour I need to call an ambulance or anything so. that's an invite the the clonazepam is an improvement, yes, because I was on xanax for over 20 years so. You know, and I. I do want to be I want something that will let me live life and i'm 44 years old now and I haven't experienced you know, a whole lot my whole entire life because i'm scared to do anything. So."
498.0,Provider,"Okay well let's just try to strategize to help you get there nope i'm not recommending any changes to your medication regimen now, but I do like to always have the always let the patient and i'll be transparent and educate them on that klonopin is not a lifelong treatment strategy."
15755.0,Patient,Right right in. fact that when I did take it because I did I started taking it when I was 19 it was.
498.0,Provider,mm hmm yep.
15755.0,Patient,"See, and now. they're they they changing things you know so like 20 what 2125 years later, so."
498.0,Provider,"yeah yes we'll see. we'll see how it goes, I would like to engage with the rp though just to. Try to kind of break down the origin of the attack and then figuring out how to manage it outside of calling the paramedics."
15755.0,Patient,"Right like like like I told Sharon, you know i've had him to sage of like four or five when I got older than I realized what it was when I was when I you know what I was having. started on periodically, you know. attack you know, I was having them like every day, every day, every every day and that's when I wanted to like. I didn't want to wake up, you know I just didn't want to live through that anymore, because every day, I was constantly just having the attack so scared every day I didn't know what to do you know and then as before they even knew what. Panic disorders work. yeah I think I was the age of I don't know 16 is when they kind of kind of started coming out with it, you know with panic disorder anxieties and all that for far as I remember. yeah the characterization of it."
498.0,Provider,"Other than be entered other than integration of the psychotherapy I think i'm staying where you are right now is is a fair assessment and then continuing to meet with me every month, just so that I can make sure that medication still going, and then it got it got it having any detriment."
15755.0,Patient,"Because I cuz i'll agree to take anything you know, and if it helps me, you know I would let you guys know you know i'm not I don't want to stay on colonize me I don't wanna I don't want to take that much. Especially if it's going to do, like cause brain damage throughout the you know, through the years or you know because it says it causes. loss of memory and stuff like that, so you know i'm good like I told Sharon i'm good with taking anything or seeing a therapist or whatever it takes, you know and i've told all psychiatrists. And you know, none of them really succeeded with me, that is kind of just threw me on the medication and well how's it working good Okay, then you're good will refund your money. On I do, and I do need the message you know cuz, then I wouldn't be able to work. Be housebound. got me in the hospital so like I told period and so."
498.0,Provider,"What this will be just it just a tad bit different i'm not just gonna throw pillows at you, I will make sure that your refills are addressed in a timely manner, because I do want you to be able to function but. My hope is that we taper the medication down so slowly not today, not tomorrow, but at an appropriate time that it's tapered so slowly, where you barely notice it. But beyond that, right now, I think we should just focus on making sure that your refills are done performed in a timely manner and that's the cycle therapy is available to you, and then we can just continue to kind of work on the tree treatment plan as you progress through it okay."
15755.0,Patient,"Right, and I think she was having me take like I, and then I tried it to for five days, and it was hard, it was like I think it was one milligram in the morning. And then I took that that pill that she prescribed early in the morning before I took. Because I started work at seven so I took the medication prescribed me in the morning and then I took my my one milligram and then I waited. And I took another milligram I don't know how many milligrams she was want me to take, I think I only took two and a day, and it was causing me to have attacked really bad. Okay yeah I think that's how she had it I wasn't for sure, so I tried that I think that's what it was, though."
498.0,Provider,"Well, this will be whenever we reached that point, this would be a much less aggressive taper and you're talking about maybe."
15755.0,Patient,Do like you know she dropped me to two milligrams you know so. yeah that's that's a big drop competitive yeah.
498.0,Provider,"yeah well I don't like drawing, you know as long as as."
15755.0,Patient,Long as my body feels good and I don't have a tax. You know they're down to one you know.
498.0,Provider,But no. We won't go there.
15755.0,Patient,"But you know what I mean no no i'm saying in future in the future, you know, like, if I can get down to one that'd be awesome or if I need to zero, I mean that's that's even better, I can just live life, you know it's awesome."
498.0,Provider,"yeah one one thing at a time therapy first and then we get to a point where therapy is equipped you well with regard to skills and we'll take a micro dosing strategy and we may go from two to 1.8. In the morning in the evening and then 1.6 and then 1.5 but it won't be aggressive like I said it'll be it'll be very, very, very, very slight and very gradual, to the point where, hopefully, you know your body knows the difference. yeah yeah Okay, and the are you do, you know how to check into the virtual clinic and schedule a follow up visit with me."
15755.0,Patient,"i'm yes, I do."
498.0,Provider,"Okay i'm go ahead and schedule a follow up visit with me i'll go ahead and submit your refill it will not likely be available for pickup before the 21st it's typically 24 to 48 hours before your next refill is due, and because yours isn't due until the 23rd. And I just don't want you to be concerned about not having it so it will."
15755.0,Patient,"Get scared on that too so well, like, I always have my tiger is my psychiatrist you know. I I gotta have it, make sure it's there and blah blah blah and then one day I was out for three days and I was off of the job for three days, because I didn't have it, and I was like shaken and all kinds of stuff and I was just in my bed, and you know just. It was crazy, it was I was a lot younger those in my 20s."
498.0,Provider,"So yeah I wouldn't put you under any unnecessary duress, but. This will be taken care of and i'll also make a recommendation for you to be contacted with regard to being paired with a therapist. So one of the care navigators me reach out to you, other than that you can go ahead and schedule an appointment with me a follow up appointment with me for January and i'll See you in about four weeks."
15755.0,Patient,OK. OK and. Will you be. A you my secret psychiatrist or.
498.0,Provider,Well yeah well i'm just like.
15755.0,Patient,NP okay.

15755.0,Patient,"sure. to drop not dropped me, but she said that she no longer works with which I don't mind working with you, I don't I work with anybody that I helped me so."

15755.0,Patient,"Okay okay sounds good that's why I wanted to know okay so sounds good, to me, too."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, see you in four weeks."
