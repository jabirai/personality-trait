I have a request to make, and this is what I need to know I got to get this information. You know, however, you need to talk to you they're going to want to do whatever easiest then that's probably hoopoe you away, but if. We don't allow yourself to be you know brushed aside, they have to deal with you. Right so yeah no that's that's not inside information that's that's public knowledge."
13003.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't know that and they still have my gun I just haven't went up there to get it. Because truthfully I haven't been, in my opinion i've been with what happened with my husband and. Everything all together and being isolated from people I just didn't it was a great idea for me to pick up yet."
126.0,Provider,"No, not I don't either especially. Right now yeah."
13003.0,Patient,"Right, so I waited and I will wait until tommy's actually out because I have to have something here with me because, if I wouldn't have that gun that nine out of I wouldn't be here at all. But mentally I know when i'm ready, I know what i'm not and i'm still not."

So."
126.0,Provider,that's crazy.
13003.0,Patient,"yeah they've got literally people mean there's an argument or something stupid and. She literally said you're crazy shot when your family members, I was like no I did not, I was like it wasn't a number, I said was it was a family which that just sounded stupid when it came out."
126.0,Provider,Exactly because that doesn't mean I didn't do it that just means it wasn't a fan.

But I don't I don't go looking just to hurt people I don't that's not me, I never, never happen. People know they don't have to take me because i'm very blunt. But don't ask me if you don't want to know. right because i'm going to tell you the truth, and you may not like it."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13003.0,Patient,"I try to tell them before they asked me but. It comes off me being a bitch i'm not going to be honest with you, if you're."
126.0,Provider,You in advance i'm not going to sugarcoat it so.
13003.0,Patient,You don't like the answer.
126.0,Provider,Right don't shoot the messenger.
13003.0,Patient,Exactly so.
126.0,Provider,So i'm just hoping.
13003.0,Patient,"This abilify because I know my brains I knew I know I got bipolar and I know, sometimes you know are going at manic state and I try to keep a journal, so that I kind of know and i'm headed towards it, but it seems like i've been manic for a little while. And I don't know."
126.0,Provider,How many times.
13003.0,Patient,"Oh, my goodness i'm at this point, one four to five. wow that's way too much. So that's what I was like I need help somehow because i'm not processing things right."
126.0,Provider,yeah.
13003.0,Patient,And i'm doing things that are not me.
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13003.0,Patient,"that'd be honest, as long as I recognize I can stop it i'm trying to do so."
126.0,Provider,"Well that's good that you're writing about it. Because, then you really have something you can start to see a pattern. You know how often is it's you know, like. If you can head it off before it comes, you know or having some kind of what there's no coping skill that you can incorporate to kind of like. Immediately calm yourself down like the breathing or the visualization or."
13003.0,Patient,I mean. not really because it always seems like when I do it i'm in a panic. mode when it starts and went to kids.
126.0,Provider,Because I know thinking.
13003.0,Patient,it's there's a rational thinking oh yeah.
126.0,Provider,"You don't have any sign that it's kind of coming on like like i'm a painter and I know when i'm getting ready to face. I can see my vision going like that and I tried to hurry up and sit down. i've ended up fainting many times, but I can have like that little quarter second the know it's coming."
13003.0,Patient,I think sometimes I can kind of feel it coming on. I thought about trying to meditate I got a put a bunch of Apps in my phone that help you meditate because that when they read that it worked out it worked oh so good. It was. It was great um. So I may try that because I started feeling coming on I gotta find some way to cope with it.
126.0,Provider,yeah.
13003.0,Patient,"Because my kids are they've seen me do this, my entire life. And like I kicked me out of my house. Would you go and I asked him a question he started stopping us foot and acting just completely like an idiot and I thought. I don't know why you have to get loud, it was it was as simple as are you working at that other house or not. You are you especially working there are. what's going on. Instead of just answering the question he went into this big. Get get the hell out of my house. mm hmm so I guess my daughter gave a ride somewhere he's like well I made your mom some something Mr mom she kicked me out of the House. And my daughter said, well, did you piss her off and he's like no she did my dad visceral it's like he's like no say wait she's as crazy, as you have to deal with that one and i'm not crazy i'm not crazy. don't I would not go to someone else's house and yell I would never do it. yeah so directed to my in my house."
126.0,Provider,No that's healthy boundaries.
13003.0,Patient,"In you as well. This is simply that yes, i'm working out the other house or no i'm not working there."
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Yes, mother, has been working on so that's why i'm asking. and whatever made him go to that place it's his problem, he came into the room with that problem, he. Yes, he had nothing to do with you."
13003.0,Patient,yeah I just thought I thought every so i'm gonna be like I was crazy I was again i'm not crazy i'm not gonna have someone stomping their foot and screaming at my kitchen because he had somebody say yes or no.
126.0,Provider,"Right Okay, but you know, the more time just keep saying i'm not crazy it sounds more like you are."
13003.0,Patient,"Yes, I know."
126.0,Provider,"there's an old Shakespeare saying. Just protest too much. Yes, you have you heard that."
13003.0,Patient,"Yes, that's our lives with her about her, she said that I was like well you know as it should happen like that doesn't it I just bought."
126.0,Provider,And and that's why you need to take on that attitude of none of my business with anybody thinks of me I know i'm not crazy I can't sit there and convince people that you're not because it's.
13003.0,Patient,"me personally, I was you, but I prefer not to hear what people think of me if I want to know all ask you."
126.0,Provider,"Right and I don't. People don't have that common sense and so it's yeah and and people make assumptions and you know. judgments of other people, you know they're very judgmental."
13003.0,Patient,Oh yes.
126.0,Provider,"And the place, I work during the day is had a place where these guys are coming fresh out of prison, you know they've been addicted in meth heroin whatever they got tattoos all at one guy has tattoos on his eyelids. Oh, how and. You know, at first, I was like Oh, these are some scary and they were they're just big Teddy bears they. Cry at the end of the day, they want to hug. i'm like the mama bear over there and I stopped being judgmental. After it started meeting these guys and you know they're really scary looking but all they they want what everybody else wants, you know happiness and health and recovery and not out in the streets using drugs and."
13003.0,Patient,"Some of the best people i've met have been tattooed from head to toe at first, I was scared I was scared him so bad, and then they end up being the most helpful didn't hurt me often take you to the front me."
126.0,Provider,"See oh. yeah. And it's just because they're they're out of the norm. Right and it's like that doesn't mean they're not friendly or caring or loving or kind Oh, he just came fresh out of jail he's he's criminal hardcore gangster. I had one of the guys that were covered with tattoos tell me at one of our groups with you know, like 20 other guys and i'm the only woman networks there it's all men and. This guy he just he says vaughn I would have came into treatment, a long time ago if I would have known how fun, it was. Because these guys are like on lockdown they're there in a residential place for 30 days they they can't leave until their first 30 days. Are over so it's really hard for them, they can only make one phone call a week and yeah so. anyway. What is your, what is your goal that you need to put in place in okay after you meet with the guys mom. Your plan of action is what."
13003.0,Patient,"yeah I really I don't it's going to depend on the answer. because some people are saying no to that he's he stills talk TV people are still talking to him, so a lot of people saying joy there's no way he's ever get now. And then other were like, no, no, is normal. That that that's going to. happen quicker already you know I figured I call her this evening and ask it makes you eat for lunch. or either over the weekend or Monday."
126.0,Provider,And if you can't find anything out from her.
13003.0,Patient,"You go to the police stations yeah yeah so because she has, I mean like I said she's very friendly and my daughter's been very open about this, but now she's a little hesitant because of her coming home from josie and doug's and her say no, I got to talk to my Daddy on the phone. yeah and Morgan said that was her idea that you. have to contact."
126.0,Provider,Your gestures yeah.
13003.0,Patient,"So. And I hate the fact that just to miss out on the other, grandparents i'm hoping that she doesn't have to but it sounds like it's that's how it's going to be."
126.0,Provider,But that's later on down the line. yeah okay ma'am well i'm gonna let you go. See you in group and just take a deep breath.
