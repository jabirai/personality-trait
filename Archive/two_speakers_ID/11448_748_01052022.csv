11448.0,Patient,Hello. How are you.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, so good to see you how are you."
11448.0,Patient,i'm good it's really good to see you too.
748.0,Provider,Well you're in a new setting.
11448.0,Patient,I rearranged my room. But it's not done that's why it's like really messy and hence the blur. Okay yeah.
748.0,Provider,"I have been moving for over a month, so it's. been a blur for me too absolutely."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah um. wanted to talk today about um something that. I like tried to. not think about except i'm reminded of every time I look in a mirror of which is my weight. and And I think that my body overall. And i'm kind of in that situation where. I the last therapist I was working with she called it like a like a light switch to the way that my brain kind of operates where it's like I go from one thought to the other, I can be really hard on myself but. Show myself a bit of patients, at the same time, but ultimately issues become a little exhausting I top of thinking about everything else um. So as of. A think since i'm going on the medication i've been gaining a lot of weight just because my mood you know, has been a lot better. Because of you know, the lexapro that's prescribed to me, which is great in La I wanted able to enjoy and eat with others, and you know just not feel guilty about it, but at the same time. Because. i've given up on. On like fitness activity and things like that, because I, I have like really negative associations with you know sports in general. Well, with kind of what i've been through it's. just been really like hard to accept where my physical body is that now and. Some days when I wake up, I I feel strong you know I, I know that. i'm paying eight because you know, I have a duty to keep this body warm and. and running and full of energy, and you know just not neglected like I did before the past, and even though I would look at old pictures of you know what I was training and everything like that. Despite how like good I like thought I looked I was like in peak shape but. When I look at that person in old photos she's just miserable and. This is also like in tandem with. There was one time, when I a long time ago, I was preparing for an event, and I was going for a morning run to the yoga studio in that in that week of the event, and that was when. I was sexually assaulted by a bystander like in their early hours when it's dark and. Even though, like, I always compare like my body now to what it was a few years ago um. I can't help it fake like. That that body didn't belong to me. And for the longest time i've just. i've just got i've been putting it off, and you know I run I run. into some days like well before the medication I would use it as a form of therapy, but then I also noticed that I would start to abuse the running and just not eat and just run for miles, just like anything get away. everything and everyone and i'm."
748.0,Provider,In from yourself.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah I always was lucky that. i'm running in search of something not to get away from something but. It hindsight it was a little bit of both yeah. And so now i've just been having a really hard time accepting like these things that you know my sister or me or my mom she would tell me like you're not you're not fat like stop telling yourself that. But at the same time i'm almost the same person that would say like Oh, you know you're too skinny and. Even though, like her, I don't seek validation from her it's just annoying to hear it from from family. yeah and um. I just. i'm like now in this position of also like comparing myself to like two people that I used to associate myself with in you know this, the realm of fitness and martial arts and stuff and you know they're they're going there their path and i'm going mine and. Even though i'm really grateful to not be surrounded by those people, because it was just so mentally and emotionally exhausting. I can't help but compare like Oh, but their bodies look so great, you know and they're they're putting in the work and the results are showing in well that again, these people are like always getting ready for like competitions or events and things like that and. Even though, like, I understand that that's just not my lifestyle anymore. I beat myself up for it. i'm with like the everything that i'm dating again and. You know I I tried going back and forth on thinking like Oh, should I just pay for like a gym membership but realistically like financially it's just not feasible right now and. And I think, and I can feel myself slowly slipping back to like those previous thoughts of just feeling financially stuck in eventually that leading to you know the phone call to the hotline. But I want to be able to address it now, because for the longest time i've convinced myself Oh, you know I, this is just like a growing body, and these things happen, you know and. This is normal like because it is and i'm it's not say like Oh, I look up to celebrities because I don't but. It just kind of sucks seeing these like people that you want to associate yourself with kind of continue on. With with a part of you that, like. You used to familiarize yourself with and. I don't know I feel like despite me change trying to make changes mentally emotionally like psychologically. physically like i'm just not there either and. And I just I hate everything that I own i've been like. just getting rid of things in my closet and it just makes me feel sad because it's not really necessarily like how the clothes look on, but how they make me feel. and I think like. i'm just scared because. During that time of like living in La or just. You know, getting ready for for competitions and like and training and things like that. You know I really put in the work and be really happy with my results, but I just always felt empty nonetheless."
748.0,Provider,"So one of the things that I notice is happening news you started out by being really deeply in your feelings. And I think a little bit more connected to your body. And then, as you. As you talk you. Will so focused on making sure that I could understand what you were talking about that you left your body. And you were really in. So i'm wondering how your body feels."
11448.0,Patient,Gross like I I.
748.0,Provider,How does your body feel about the way we're talking.
11448.0,Patient,disappointed.
748.0,Provider,disappointed in itself on. This appeal appointed in your body. yeah yeah. But your body's working really hard to support you in the work you're doing right.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah and and I think that's one of the other things i'm just having i'm just struggling with is that. For the moments that I am trying to be kind to myself, like. I just don't allow it, I shut those feelings out and I thought about it, and you know if if we were experiencing this winter like maybe as cold, as it as it is, if we were experienced that like years ago I don't think my body would be able to keep myself warm like. it's a good thing that I have you know fat now and. I am i'm like sustaining myself and. But I just. I think like i'm just having a really hard time like. Accepting like how I am now yeah."
748.0,Provider,"going to say it feels like one of the biggest issues presenting is self acceptance. And in the past, there was very little self acceptance internally. Which is where you've been putting your attention is on how I feel is okay, in fact, how I feel is new for me and validating that for myself and not allowing in those sources and people in situations that interrupt and interfere with my well being is not okay so that's where your energy. But you need the self acceptance or room to body, too, and I can't see your body, so I can't speak to what what I can see, as your shoulders. and your shoulders lead me to believe that your sister is giving you some accurate feedback that that that you're being hard on yourself. you're being hard on yourself but I don't want to discount the part of you, that is very. clear about the kind of healthy shape that you're in well athletic shape that you were you know you were a. Brian high level athletes, when we were doing that work so some amount of grief feels appropriate. And, and why i'm saying all this is because there's just so many pieces going, you know and it feels like something that would be really good for you to write about. Because we do such good work when you're doing journey."
11448.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,And then the other piece that i'm really hearing is that and your former therapist use that term light switch and i'm guessing that was in reference to you well i'm not sure explain it.
11448.0,Patient,"Like i'm my thoughts go are just like bouncing back and forth, as if you're flickering a light switch. Like it's that easy."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, and and one of the things i've heard is the extreme the black and white, which is, I think, similar to the light switch and. And also. Well, a combination of being really hard on yourself, of course, but also. I want to use the term dysmorphic that that you're cool you seen the New Year is in depth."
11448.0,Patient,huh.
748.0,Provider,yeah and there is that that super high expectation. So. loving yourself mean. For us to be able to do the healing work we needed to do around How would use it that sports. Maybe for athletic world was needed to move away from from a one for one. And doesn't mean for it.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah hey. hey cuz I was looking through old photos because I wanted to get some black and whites printed and framed for my walls and. You know, I was also looking at. Like special occasions like weddings and stuff and. It there were there were a lot. In the past, while you know being involved in that athletic world. And it just don't want to print them because, despite how significant those events were and how how how much fun I had. it's just like seeing my body in you know that that era of my life and. I just feel like this. i'm sure like a lot of people are just always reminded of their past, but I just can't seem to. And I don't want to run away from it, you know I think it's just i'm i'm tired of kind of because just feels like a dog chasing its tail or you know, or maybe the other way around like that, but anyways um. I know that even my thought process is not healthy, but I just can't help it. It I don't know if it's because it's easy to be hard on myself or if it's just so innate of me just because. Again, like i've i've had people be hard on me in for narcissistic reasons, you know and."
748.0,Provider,And it's very familiar. yeah yeah talk about a light switch that's an easy one to turn on.
11448.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,"you're not doing enough, you should be working harder all of those things. And you know you need new light switch, which is a light switch that's about being gentle with yourself, while still incorporating the fact that you want to be healthy, not only. Mind body, I mean mind part emotion, but but body as well and I hear that you are and unite I heard you say you're still running is that accurate."
11448.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,So you're still running and you do yoga you.
11448.0,Patient,yeah be like I think I mentioned like it's just the yoga studio I live by it's just really expensive and it's not how.
748.0,Provider,Right you do some at home.
11448.0,Patient,Is that yeah yeah I try.
748.0,Provider,yeah so it isn't as if what you've done is what from that high level of athletic training to. donuts and chocolate declares and ice cream buckets of ice cream. and never move it no it's not it's it's that you. you're prioritizing your inner world for right now to heal.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah I. I you know just. i'm just stretching myself out too thin because i'm convinced myself, but I can't have it all, and I will have it all like I but right now I I think i'm ultimately lying to myself, because realistically like I I just can't have it all right now. I don't have the funds, you know, like the literal means to to support myself to you know. Even even preparing for like a half marathon is like really expensive like having a book a hotel and everything and. And in those moments I like training, for it makes me feel really happy. But then suddenly when the when the photos come out when you have like your racer bid on one and your number, and I just can't help but, like all of a sudden, look at my legs like Oh, like my calves used to be in such great shape and you know. I can take on high intensity but. But I truthfully I was really disappointed in you know my runs my like my runtime and even though, like. It I wasn't striving to be like the fastest runner or you know smash like a certain time, it ultimately just looking at the time just kind of disappointed me where I couldn't help but think like oh like Anna and her younger 20s would have been so much better. And then, all of a sudden, like, I would take away all that, like joy and happiness that went into training with with like so something as simple as like. That one self sabotaging thought."
748.0,Provider,"Like. That I want you to write that down now one self sabotaging. And it's That was the quintessential description. Those things that are positive that we say to ourselves or other say to us like kept one. yeah you're them and they slide right off, whereas the negative oh in my 20s I would have been so much faster. than velcro. sticks and you are often running in and mired in. I used to do it better I should be doing better i'll never be look like I did in my 20s now of course you want, because we won't be in your 20s."
11448.0,Patient,Right.
748.0,Provider,But who are you today as a result of foods. Are you becoming it couldn't be. And who will you become that you can't be.
11448.0,Patient,"that's what i'm I am excited for cuz. I mean, I know people always say like Oh, time is like. a figment or whatever, and you know you shouldn't be measuring your life in in in decades like that, but. There, that I don't know for me like i've always been excited to you know become 30 and experience my 30s like I even as a teenager I didn't care much to to drink or come to anyone, and you know go to the bars really that and. i'm just hoping. The goal for me is to. to match how I look outside as I feel inside but right now it's just it's been really hard in. You know I can't help, but like judge the way I eat, but before even in the past, like to to attain a certain like wait i'm like frame of wait I would always start."
748.0,Provider,Now you're choosing help.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah and but then you know because I work late night and. i'm always, I find myself eating whatever is available whatever's convenient. And that's just as abusive and you know I do try to make it a point to eat healthy but. I don't know like I I feel like. In a lot of ways this like high school version of Anna is like coming back where I would almost like eat myself. to sleep or I don't want to say to death, but, like, I would just overload so that I don't have to like deal with it anymore, and I think that's a scary thing to consider because I don't know if i'm suddenly finding comfort in food to avoid things as well. And I don't I don't have a radar for that."
748.0,Provider,"Well that's certainly something that's done in this culture. and and encouraged and then change. You know it's it's encouraged by every commercial you watch encouraged by. By every store you walk into to get this yummy food, and you have this fabulous experience, because this and. You know the all of that's encouraged and the minute that you actually do it and it shows up on your body your shape. yeah so it's a no win culture. And then we adopt. That in our head. And one of the things that's happening, and yes, it is true that we can have a food coma. It would just become completely numbed out as a result of food isn't that lovely and then you'd beat yourself up for. So one of the things is really noticing when you're taking over it's that same thing as the parental. So critical parent voice the critical culture, plus. yeah when you've taken on that same thing so as much as it feels like and sounds like age difference it's also awareness. Through a lot more aware of what your mind is saying. Then you've been in the past, and also a lot more aware of how you feel and how it impacts result."
11448.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
748.0,Provider,"And that's great news, even though it sucks rocks. yeah right like oh yeah I got more awareness. But that awareness is challenge."
11448.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"So then it's taking the next step right, the next step after the awareness is how do I nurture myself how do I change this so that i'm being kind to myself. And the answer isn't something that is going to make you know some answers to take a bubble bath or do some journaling or call someone who will be nicer to you the near being to yourself at the moment or. You know or or go for a walk instead of an hour run that's going to make you. I don't know if number is the right word because i'm not a runner but that runner's high that you."
11448.0,Patient,say.
748.0,Provider,"For this, and about health it's about time. yeah but instead nurture yourself with a walk outside and fresh here we're seeing nature and getting out of your head."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah definitely um. One last thing I wanted to kind of talk about was so I I did the the codependence meeting. Yes, and we didn't step we did, because it was like since it was so fresh beginning of the year we kind of did like a recap more than breaking it down like I think this week it was supposed to be like, starting with topic, one, but then I didn't I wasn't able to make it. So when I, but the week before, when I was able to um. I don't know. How to I think i'm having a really hard time like engaging or listening because there's so many people."
748.0,Provider,Oh okay.
11448.0,Patient,"there's like pages and pages because it's just like a free zoom. yeah i'm link and. You know it's first hour it's like going over like the it's like a syllabus or an outline that they have and and just talking about how oh. code event dependency or hi my name is Anna and I am a codependent and then you know everyone just kind of like popcorn reading and then shortly after that she kind of left the floor for anyone who wants to speak. Or, if anyone was new. And the some for some of the women like I can. I who did speak who word new. I resonated with them, just because. We they all kind of said the same thing, like I don't know what to expect out of this, but you know my therapist you know suggested it and. i'm open to it, and then there are some other people were there were just like cursing up a storm saying like this is like you know i'm not need to 12 steps and. Sorry, my frozen."
748.0,Provider,yeah you weren't here.
11448.0,Patient,"um some people were saying that they're not. they're not new to 12 steps, this is something that they've done before in the past and they're revisiting and I just was wondering if you had any tips or advice on how to just kind of. I don't know like. I guess I don't know I don't know if this is appropriate to ask, but like, how can I. get the most out of it because, for the women that did share when you know. When. The person spearheading the meeting kind of just like left the floor to anyone who wanted to get things off their chest, especially because it was after the holidays, a lot of women were like crying. And just saying it, but I realized in codependency like a lot of these women also like to know when to stop speaking. I know, no one was like timing them. Okay, so."
748.0,Provider,"And and 12 step meetings can be like that. it's why it's recommended that you go to six. Different meetings before you make a decision. That may not be the best meeting for you, because was it a newcomer meeting was that the idea behind it i'm just curious or was it just a regular meeting."
11448.0,Patient,It was just a regular meeting yeah it's like kota like a new life or something like that.
748.0,Provider,"Okay okay um yeah it's it takes getting used to it is definitely a practice that you that takes getting used to like the format and the. concepts and the readings and how repetitive that can feel and the intensity sometimes. The other thing. That. i'm wondering if that might be helpful, is, if you also read the book codependent no more. That."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah I recently downloaded an audible so. That I can listen to it like at work with like a headphone in um but. Either way, you know they weren't pushing for it, but they were definitely promoting like the Blue Book. it's like the codependent anonymous and it's kind of like a step by step, or. mom and then also there were mentioning how oh if anyone's interested we're going to put together like they eventually want to put out like a work some kind of workbook. Not like I don't know if it's like an activity book or something for like. Maybe for journaling purposes, but um. I don't know I. I just don't know like what exactly to expect out of it, because when upon looking at the. It was like a. patterns and characteristics of codependency. yeah and I was looking through it and it was like crap, I guess, we do have a lot of these issues, just not issues but points and."
748.0,Provider,characteristics.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah characteristics in a lot of which I feel would be. You know, good talking points just threw up therapy, but um for the longest time I thought my impression of codependence was a oh like. People who, just like leech on to you or like our don't know how to be self reliant and. Our kind of like babies, I guess, and it's almost a mature like like, for instance, that one friend, I had or acquaintance that I recently had to just like cut ties with it yeah I she to me was like oh that's the perfect you know."
748.0,Provider,"picture perfectly true you know, one of the one of the ways that codependence can be described that I think is is reflective of. The deeper concept of codependency to me is that we're reactors, rather than actors and to me that is a statement, not about the reaction it's a statement about trauma. Because when our lives have been deeply impacted by especially repeated trauma will always in a state of fight or flight."
11448.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And if that is the habituated pattern. What in what what needs to interrupt, it is a new learning and and new and creating a new year or so to see yourself through. And that's what I liked about the codependency work. Is that it really acknowledges and honors that saying, where we actors not actors isn't a judgment it's the beginning of fueling. So I get to notice that that's out there, I am again all these feelings that lights, which is all because i'm reacting. and looking in New York and i'm not just seeing me i'm reacting to what i'm seeing with judgment that it's bad. Why is that because i'm in fight or flight again I just went into. Oh, my God, I am a wreck. As opposed to. My body is different than it used to be."
11448.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Now, not pushing it the way I used to push it when I was at that gym i'm not being hard on it like that i'm eating differently i'm taking the meditation there may be some changes i'd like to make, as I continue to grow. Now, I can say all that and that sounds wonderful because that's a response, instead of a reaction that doesn't mean that's what I would do and to me it takes practice. And time so. You know, it may be, and I just heard you say. That you're not you're not sure about the meetings and it's something you'd like to talk about in our sessions. And that's another way to address it, at least as a start, but you may find the reason that I suggested the meetings is when you find meetings that really feel good to you that, like they're of service and support it also means you're creating a healthy community. And maths, the positive side."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah I think it's just because I. I don't recall having that ever because i'm, for instance um my parents would take me to temple every Sunday, since I was like maybe 1314 up until I was maybe 17 so for about four years of my life four or five years and. I always thought oh we're here to learn not all it was like a Vietnamese like school but also. A lot of. teachings about like the Buddha and things like that so in the very early morning every Sunday, I learned like it means grammar and spelling and vocabulary and then in in the afternoon. that's when we'd have downtime and learn like stories and things like that, and so it was basically like a youth group, you know much like how. there's Christian youth group and Catholic youth Group and And for the longest time I. I really thought that Oh, these people are like my brothers and sisters. Because we would have like hard and heavy conversations about like our fears for the future and. You know, family dynamics and things like that. But I also realized like. Okay, like is this like. This is like cold tea because i'm the things that they would like say if it was just very like demanding as someone who was you know going to practice like freely and. I think like they tried to operate it almost like a business and that's when it kind of like this integrated my like idea of them and. it's not so much I guess it's not so much of a cult, but I think, because everyone has their like expectations of like each member or. You know, an attendee or whatever. And that was I was exposed to that when I was you know really young, though, is like a teenager and um. And for a while, I thought that you know Oh, this is like of service and a good support, but then once I stopped going and I told them, you know hey I have to go off to college that's when like the ugly came out. And it was like oh How dare you leave us and, and it was more so from like the youth group leaders, then it was you know the temple it was really bizarre and I think like that definitely set up. My issues of just finding and trying to cultivate a community. Like I I tried to find it in you know in martial arts, I tried to find it with people like that I met through martial arts like overseas when I would go to Thailand, like every other year and. I just felt like I was running into the same old problems and i'm hoping, you know by going through kota or codependence anonymous and. Just being able to shift, you know my thought process of not approaching the situation thinking like. These people owe me something or you know or or should or putting an expectations like i'm hoping like these people better be better than you know this last group of people I dealt with, but just being able to better navigate through it, because. Like I mentioned, like the list of the characteristics it's I highlighted certain ones where it really stood out to me that. Before I thought, like oh yeah no like this doesn't work against me like this works like for me, which is like oh being loyal, for instance, and and how that can be really damaging in. You know hostile relationships and friendships and things like that, and so I think it's just a matter of like. Keeping you know, keeping an open mind and keeping my ears open and in hopes that something will i'll come across something that that resonates with me deeply but I don't know if I can sit there for two hours every Tuesday night and like listen to other women cry."
748.0,Provider,For two hours is a long time I i'm not. Any better is that long that's the longest meeting and third up. yeah an hour.
11448.0,Patient,"that's what I would think to but they make us go through, like all of the."
748.0,Provider,Was there a newcomer meeting first or something.
11448.0,Patient,"No, it was it was a lot of people who have been doing it habitually and then also like a big group of newcomers, you know, including myself, but. I think again, it was just because there is no real like. They they they really emphasize i'm like not cross talking but at the same time i'm thinking like cheese, like my other regroup sessions like at least we kind of respect each other's time and attendance but."
748.0,Provider,"yeah that's and, of course, there is no leader so there's just the person who sort of is responsible for the literature nothing yeah I would definitely look for other meeting."
11448.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,"I definitely would because, and I will say that that you know. Another another point that you might consider checking out simultaneously or instead is adult children and alcoholism another dysfunction. Because that's the characteristics that lead to codependency. and My guess is for right now you'd prefer being on zoom. yeah. But you still might look in the mountains number I think it's w s oh. No. Maybe it. that's it a CA w s o.org. That will you can look up meetings anywhere I would look up meetings close to you and. so that you can go in person at some point and and the outcome of growing up with dysfunctional in challenging traumatic experiences that's what a car. is usually codependence so and and we were talking about relationships and how that shows up in my whole reason for suggesting news is they're prevalent they're everywhere, when I say they I mean meetings there for a fade cultivate community. And it's a place for you to be able to find support and healing when you're not with brighter than."
11448.0,Patient,Right.
748.0,Provider,"So and that's what I want you to be able to have and there's you know there's so many different kinds of meetings, once you get started, but they'll literature in a car, really, really, really good really good."
11448.0,Patient,"Well that's great. yeah I it was weird because i'm this Oh, something that I mentioned over the phone when I asked about the meeting details and like to they're not there, the person who hosts the zoom meetings and. I asked her, I was like a there's like a there's a lot of references to God i'm. not comfortable with that. And she was just like Oh, you know we get all types like you could be Muslim, you can be Christian give me, you know Catholic you'd be atheist doesn't matter, but you know it's just just like it's just there as a reference to like the a divine being or something greater than us, but."
748.0,Provider,"Something greater than ourselves and and it's important at a higher powers what's often us. yeah and. what's important is remembering that the people who are there are human beings and the intention is different than the people. yeah The intention is for us to remember that that small self that's in fear you you personally have a higher self that's much bigger than that small cells that feels scared all the time. And that's higher self is even. A better framework, then, then the little ego that saying i'm not good enough i'm not doing it right that that's so hard. And I don't know what you took from new Buddhists. Training if if there was any sense of connection with higher consciousness as a result."
11448.0,Patient,"I think if anything it it motivated me to to keep looking into it um. I think. Just already by like the way they speak and I think it's, just like the vocabulary of it all it, it does freaked me out and."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then so, then that is something that you may. find too uncomfortable to to pursue those meetings you'll one of the things is is just give it give yourself, the recommendation i'm pretty sure I said this before. Six meetings."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah that's what other people were saying, as they were you know logging on to the zoom meeting saying like well yeah like i've gone. Through like different groups. And I stayed around for about you know the recommend recommended six meetings, but you know i'm just here to kind of figure out what's best for me and. it's the one great takeaway that I took. From the meeting was that. Despite you know, because it was a woman's only meeting so despite where these women. You know we're in the we're in their life, a lot of them did say like oh i've had experienced before with 12 steps in the past and i'm here again so. it's great to know that it's there you know and it's a great resource and even for the women who were like who did share without their video on so I couldn't make an association like voice to face but. I can tell that like they just really needed an outlet. And these people that were willing to you know just log on and dedicate two hours of their afternoon of their evening. we're there to listen or that's what I would hope, I don't know if people are just like leaving their computers to the side or their phone to the side but. I don't know, I think that was like the most uplifting or the only uplifting part of it all is to know that, like okay there's a Community out there that they recognize that these these behaviors and these patterns and they are willing to work on it, just as much as you yeah."
748.0,Provider,"And, and as you go to different meetings The other thing that will happen is hearing people who have been doing it for a while, often a long while. And how different their lives so."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah a lot of them talk about sponsors and I don't think I need that necessarily because. And I think my. codependence is kind of more so somewhere else, rather it doesn't quite crucial me as it may have maybe in the past, because I am keeping myself and check with this journal um but yeah I i'm excited to see more about this adult children's. Is it, since it mentions like of alcoholics and dysfunctional families is it more so rooted in the the home or is it just with the script."
748.0,Provider,Originally it was. It was designed about trauma in.
11448.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,"Okay yeah what but what you know it well, I can't say what your experience will be but that's why I didn't originally recommend that is because that isn't so much more experience and yet I think you may relate to the characteristics and the and the. Communication and feelings. You can just try it and see."
11448.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely I they have like a literature tab so.
748.0,Provider,Oh yeah the literature is phenomenal.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah Oh, it also references."
748.0,Provider,All 12 step programs to.
11448.0,Patient,"I Oh, I, like you said higher being right it's like a collider power yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Right right 12 step programs do because they all come out of the original one, and that is a big part of it yeah. What in a, which is where it all started, one of the things that often get said is we need something bigger greater than ourselves to stop thinking more and. we're responsible for changing it all, and it doesn't matter if it's a door knock or a rock or the group, or in other words it doesn't have to be a religious experience. But you know if if it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you and you can determine."
11448.0,Patient,yeah I.
748.0,Provider,"can keep talking about it, as you go to meeting."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah that would be great just because I feel I feel like i'm. You know I had for the longest time I thought that my issues were just like basic boundary sending but it's also certain you know characteristics, where i'm allowing certain beavers to happen or to you know. These certain people seem to gravitate towards me and. there's a that I have to change with myself in order to. To stop that and. yeah that would be great if I kick into you're talking about it with you because."
748.0,Provider,I love it.
11448.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,I would love it I. love it.
11448.0,Patient,"yeah there's like so many patterns that. I see the change where it's like okay i'm not I don't know there's certain controller, what do they have like avoidance patterns and like compliance there's certain things where. I recognize from my past that I used to do a lot heavily and then there are things that I need to work on now, but you know i'm kind of. I shouldn't be comparing like i'm not like they haven't color coded and everything I shouldn't be comparing how much I have highlighted, but i'm i'm like happy to see like the work that i'm doing and i'm happy to believe in the work that i'm doing so. I think that's like the hardest part is to convince myself that. That i'm just in good standing you know."
748.0,Provider,yeah really giving yourself credit.
