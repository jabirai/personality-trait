527.0,Provider,"Well let's look and see where you're at and. You get things pulled up here. So you are me look. you're a weekly group right. there's still okay. Alright, so usually The next step is we drop down to twice a month group. And then it goes to once a month group that's kind of like the steps so. um. yeah. So what's your question what."
11476.0,Patient,Can I do that twice a month twice a month.
527.0,Provider,"You can yeah i'll check it out. Times, a month and then i'm going to put it, starting in. November, for you. Okay, so I will have them reach out and let you know what group what weeks to to attend in November so. Okay okay i'll make a note. got it. I was easy."
11476.0,Patient,Thank you.
527.0,Provider,Is that better is that will that help will that be better for you. yeah I.
11476.0,Patient,"I really tried, I thought, maybe it was like my last group, but I don't know I guess right now i'm just not good at receiving other people's issues. It just. I don't know. And I don't want to call anyone out where it, you know and it's everyone else's group to it's not just my group so like I don't want to like. shake them. So it's just you know. it's not good at like I guess dealing with other people's stuff which I guess I take it on. Okay, all right."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and that may, yes, that may be something like how, how do we help you to manage you know social situations just in general for you to I think that's part of it is. You know, definitely you know when you're in a group setting you know the reason we're all here is because we're having mental health issues and so. You know that's kind of the common factor but, but at the same time, I think you've kind of been struggling with just how do I do deal with people in general to like. school and outside and public. areas and things like that to."
11476.0,Patient,"go into we went to Disneyland last week. It was do. There was a moment where I asked someone to put their mask on they're standing right next to me and the rule is that they use for us to wear inside buildings. And she got very upset asked if I was the mask police and and I and Disneyland you know they don't care, who hits first, if someone like if there's a fight they'll throw you both out kind of thing like you know. i've seen i've seen videos i'm like fine i'm like i'm not i'm not gonna say anything, because I, my God, I am. Like got my head that offer. for doing it. yeah just some I just realized like. I don't yeah I I struggled like there's like people screaming about the dodger game, and I was just like like I get I don't know why it annoys me so much like these little things. And I felt bad for my boyfriend like, for I wasn't in a bad mood the whole time but like. like this little girl cut us in line and her parents didn't apologize, and I was like your child if you can you your child um and. And I don't know I felt bad my boyfriend's just like God and like for not for long but for like a few like three or four minutes, I was in a shitty mood okay um and then it goes away. Just like sure so like I told my boyfriend like I realize I don't like people right now and people also don't like me like I am not, I know i'm not like pleasant right now."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
11476.0,Patient,"yeah it was hard, but we still had a good time, but I did notice, I was just like my tolerance for people, just so low."
527.0,Provider,What do you think it is like what is the particular trigger with that can you.
11476.0,Patient,it's like I guess I don't people aren't doing what I would do.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11476.0,Patient,"So I guess that that I just have to realize people don't. want do everything I like the way I want it done. Or how would, I think they should do."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, because the way you would do it is what, in what way."
11476.0,Patient,"Like if my kid ran in front of us again, I mean, these are all hypothetical don't have a child, but like I would be like oh my bad sorry like honey like come on don't cut these people i'm. Okay, and so I guess it just frustrates me when."
527.0,Provider,i'm like common sense.
11476.0,Patient,"yeah yeah my version of common sense. Okay, that because I know it's not the same it's not universal, but like it's my version of common sense, it makes me angry that it's not a universal common sense."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, Okay, so I I hear you on that cuz. cuz I had something happened a few weeks ago, and I was like why Why are people so stupid. didn't I didn't have the tolerance for that for that day I was like. You know, like why why. Where was your head. Like where was your head so but The thing is, so how can we, how can we work on that, then for you jenna to kind of separate like. yeah it is going to be challenging because you're going to come across people that aren't going to process things the way you process or think that that's how they should process things."
11476.0,Patient,"Because I know I it's not the worst thing in the world, get annoyed in my head, but like the thing is i've been saying things where i'm just i'll be like I took the to the kid I was like excuse you. And then, like oh my God at work this little two year old boy looked at me and said I don't like you for out of nowhere and then In response I said I don't like you either. And like and the dad looked at me and I was like oh shit i'm the adult I shouldn't have said that. So, like it it's I need. I just will say something and it's going to get me in trouble it's going to someone is you know not take kindly to it, so I I don't know how do you fix that yeah my snarky like that's my that's my go to is just to like be a bitch about it."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, I think let's look at let's look at all the triggers that fuel that feeling for you, though, like what are things that that you're holding on to like stuffing down."
11476.0,Patient,What could you rephrase that.
527.0,Provider,"Like Are there things that. Well, let me, let me pose it in this way. Do you feel like you're more depressed lately like do you feel like the depression is. Higher and just increasing the irritability and just on edge feelings like."
11476.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, that's where I would kind of. Maybe start with like where's your where's your mood at lately."
11476.0,Patient,"I mean, and I guess my mood is good at times like i've i've never had. I was never like diagnosed with depression so i'm not sure like it. I don't know I i'm happy with my boyfriend like we laugh and joke around and with my dog we play and like you know it's so it's not like i'm irritable all the time. Okay um. But I mean yeah I. yeah I mean i'm really depressed but. I don't know what like there is to do about it because what's making me depressed is just like the monotony of life of just. Or, I guess, I don't know, maybe because I guess. nothing's really changed in the last couple months my own money my like my attitude has really changed because i'm still working and. going to school and stuff couple months ago I don't know. I also don't know like what I could do about it, like if. What I could do different."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, do you like, where you're at this time and in your life."
11476.0,Patient,"Yes, because I know that it's where I need to be that it's like I need to be working I need to go to school and. I mean i'm not fun happy, I would rather be you know living on our own and stuff so but I know that I have to be working and stuff in order to do that. So, I guess, I see it as like a transition so it's like i'm tolerating it."
527.0,Provider,Okay when's the last time you felt really good like kind of. God all around.
11476.0,Patient,"Really, honestly, and this is so awful when I was regularly taking a Narco opiates. And I that's The worst thing in the world, but, honestly. Okay i'm. Like because I. Do I never liked got them off the street that was from my doctors, I had migraines and I just took them too much, and you know I had."
527.0,Provider,yeah just.
11476.0,Patient,"took them too much um so. When I got off them they had me on suboxone just for a little while like six. Months but I told my boyfriend I really I was like. This is it like this is my this is, this is what this is life now. After being like. I don't like it wasn't just like I watch TV it's like I watch TV and I was high I was like feeling good you know. yeah now it's like now I just watched TV, like everything. Okay, just. yeah felt different it but it's not as bad anymore, like, I still i've I realized. Like I think i've had to take him sense for like a root canal, and it didn't even do do the same things. So, but yeah I was last time I was like really, really happy, I would say yeah that was like five six years ago."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
11476.0,Patient,Which is it you know realistic can't do that.
527.0,Provider,"Sure sure, but I think it does put it in perspective as far as like what was going on at the time that I, you know, was able to help myself feel better and feel good yeah."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I was younger and I had less responsibility now there's a lot of pressure for me to move out which I, we want to, but it's also there's a lot of pressure and it's like you're not kids anymore, you know. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, what about anger."
11476.0,Patient,"I would like last time I felt angry, or we."
527.0,Provider,Just like How would you how would you describe your anger from that transition.
11476.0,Patient,"My parents always say that, like i'm angry and that now they think i'm they think my anger like they always think of anger issues and that it's less now, but personally I think I mean maybe it's anger, but I I yell but that's because nobody listens like nobody listens otherwise. Okay, so so. I think they take me yelling and not letting things go. As anger. Which it's not it's just like I don't know I guess I want. I don't know yeah they think it's anger, but if to me it's just like I do yell and I am loud and like, but I also I do say mean things when i'm angry, but. But my parents also do that so it's like where did I learned it from. You know."
527.0,Provider,"Sure So what do you, what do you want to say jenna like what are, what are the things that you know you. You need heard from others like. Because it sounds like sounds like you're. Like you're fighting an internal battle with yourself but nobody's really listening like what do you, what do you feel like needs to be said, or excuse me said or heard."
11476.0,Patient,I don't know I guess I don't know. i'm I guess i'm more just. struggling I like it would be great if people realize how much my anxiety is affecting me right now I guess.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11476.0,Patient,"Okay, like anxiety slash depression, but like. yeah like. it's hard for them to like communicate to communicate, especially to my parents and my boyfriend like how difficult. This is for me. But then there's also I feel ashamed that I. Like. make things such a big deal in because in hindsight i'm like you know I shouldn't have gotten that angry, because I was frustrated or something so trying what I need to be heard, I don't know I guess I."
527.0,Provider,Where do you feel like you're misunderstood I guess.
11476.0,Patient,"I don't I don't know I really I really maybe just that my anxiety is really affecting me. Or, I really know you're not."
527.0,Provider,"So what would you say about it today, like what would you want to share to me about your anxiety day like what gets you what gets you going with your anxiety."
11476.0,Patient,I don't know i'm sorry I don't know.
527.0,Provider,"that's okay. And it may just be something to kind of think about to like. Like is is there things that i'm carrying around with me like on the inside, that I feel like I can't say or that I do blurt out and say but that's not where I was really going with that, like. What I really mean by that like when I lash out like where's that coming from for me."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah I not being listened to, I guess. When I get in not anything in particular. Just them. Like not understanding what something will do to me. And how it will affect me. But then again like again in hindsight after it happens i'm like Why did I let that affect me so much like I shouldn't have got so mad at them about it, it wasn't worth it kind of thing."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so you kind of dismissed your own feelings. yeah okay."
11476.0,Patient,"cuz it like it goes back down, you know the when the anxiety goes down when the emotion goes down I don't know if it's. Because I feel more level headed, or if. The if it is just dismissing it, but I. I don't know it's like I get that. Not like saving kind of anger frustration. But like I do get kind of like blinders on. Okay um and then it's like when I relax and everything calms down like it comes at you know i'm like crap i'm said you're stupid or something."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay i'm going to find this worksheet and see. If we can maybe use this. find it. Here we go. Over so I can share my screen and show it to you. All right, because i'm wondering if this might help us to. get this thing out of the way. Oh, here we go. Okay, so let me move this out of the way here, so I want us to think about like let's just introduce these are some db T skills. dialectical behavioral therapy skills so i'm wondering if maybe this might be a good place to start this is just looking at our three mind states so we've got our emotional mind. Which is when our feelings control our thoughts and behaviors so we act impulsively with little regard to consequences. And then we've got our reasonable mind on this side, which is we approach our we approach a situation intellectually, so we have. A plan we have facts and that's how we make our decisions, you know there's no emotions involved at all, like you know it's very task oriented. So what we want to work towards is being able to integrate the two, which is the wise mind so that's being able to balance our emotional halves with our reasonable halves and be able to respond in a rational way, not an irrational way so. I want you to maybe think about this, and maybe practice some. Some situations using this tool, so you know really looking at and then i'm going to go back here to there was another one I. wanted to share. me go back. over here. Okay. Alright, so and then this is just kind of looking at how to regulate our emotions, too, so this is kind of going along with you know our well this goes into a specific skill, but this is just looking at again trying to recognize our emotions and the behaviors that come with it. So example you know for angry we fight yell or argue and so an opposite action is you know to calm ourselves and talk quietly or more assertively and behave more. politely but i'm wondering if that trying to integrate like really figuring out like what is my emotion and again what's my typical action. What can I do to replace this. And, but also, you know again going back you know checking the facts like what triggered this emotion for me. Are there interpretations or assumptions i'm making about this situation. And then again kind of how you were saying like once I sit back i'm like this, like this went way beyond what it really like it didn't match the situation so. Does it match the situation, or does it just match my assumptions of the situation. So i'm wondering if this exercise might be something to kind of challenge yourself to kind of go back and look at situations or or Are there things that i've. You know kind of stuffed inside myself that i've got lots of emotions about and i'm not really sure like how do I. How do I say those and work on those if nobody's listening to me like that's what I also hear is like jenna's voice isn't important. And the only time I get any response is if I yell or i'm nasty about it and that's not that then doesn't feel good within you that just drives your anxiety and and then. likely probably just makes you feel more bad about yourself like that's not who I am like this is not the person, I want to be so. So i'm wondering if that this might be helpful, like to be able to use those two these two exercises to like really kind of dissect some of the situations or scenarios that that you're that you're battling within yourself."
11476.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
527.0,Provider,"So. Let me give you. i'll give you that. here's the website that way you can go if you want to go look at those. worksheets. There we go yeah it's called therapist a.com so. And then I clicked on when I clicked on him there's like children, adolescents and adults, so I clicked on the adults and then go down to the db T section. But you can also explore, I mean. there's lots of other worksheets on there, if you want to just kind of flip through if there's something that kind of catches your eye, and I wonder what this skill is or what this. word is. But i'm wondering if that might kind of give you some direction or kind of help try to contain Okay, where like it feels probably like all over the place for you sometimes i'm guessing."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah and it feels like sometimes I can't help like my mom mcallen attitudes like in my voice, but like I guess just I don't know, maybe it is i'm not heard, unless I say something mean or loud. So that's like just my go to my go to way to be now."
527.0,Provider,"Right right exactly and it probably is jenna like you know you found a way it's not the the most effective way, but you found a way that gets the attention like oh so, but then Are they really listening to you or they just get this done oh there's jenna's attitude again. Exactly yeah there's wait a minute you're. done yeah so they're still not really listening and hearing what you're saying either or understanding, you know where you're coming from. yeah yeah it just kind of gets shut down again."
11476.0,Patient,yeah and again it's stupid things you know it's it's. Like it's just things that shouldn't be as big of a deal. or I guess it's a big deal to me but it's not a. Big deal to others. And that frustrates me.
527.0,Provider,Yes.
11476.0,Patient,"Yes, I guess, I can't I can't expect everyone. To like read my mind, or you know, like know for sure, like what's a big deal and what isn't. I guess I just need i'm trying to find like a happy medium. yeah like. Like it's so stupid, the other day I just I just think of random examples, but. I had made garlic bread and my mom ate some and I was like saving it and you know when you have food at home and you think of it all day you come home and someone ate it. Until like instead of getting mad because I was like I had already had a fight with my boyfriend when I got home, I was like. I just cried. Okay, so so and so it's definitely like little things, but again little things that matter to me like Oh, I had a shitty day I want to come home and eat this food. So yeah I guess it's just like that disregard. For what I think for what's important to me."
527.0,Provider,"So, and part of that is probably how do I, how do I get my point across in an assertive way like be able to put my thoughts and feelings together. again. Those thoughts and the feelings and put them together and address the person with an end yacht going, you should be able to read my mind that i've had a crappy day. And i'm gonna gnarly bread. When I come home like so so part of it is okay, how do I find ways to use my voice again and and. And let the other person know that it's important like you know, do I have to address them and say like. Can I sit and talk with you for a few minutes, do you have time, can you give me your undivided attention you know for the next five minutes you know, is it me putting notes on food and saying. yeah this is. This is mine for later, or whatever you know and not that you, you know. When I have to do that, but is that something that would help help you to you know, be able to express You know yourself if you're not able to say or. You know, send a text message saying hey I put some garlic bread in the fridge rater for my dinner later just want to make sure nobody eats it, or whatever you know."
11476.0,Patient,But yeah.
527.0,Provider,"It is. Your voice, you know, has just been shut down for so long that any little thing just comes out like an attack. yeah yeah."
11476.0,Patient,"Then you know cross like a shame that, like little little things bother me but. But realizing that they're like they're not little to me I guess."
527.0,Provider,Right yeah and I think not dismissing those for yourself. Like not. minimizing or dismissing your feelings about things. yeah.
11476.0,Patient,"And then I also wanted to mention I had midterms this week. Okay um and I am with I have DSS support like the students with disabilities support. From my school. So I get like a longer testing time I get like early registration kind of thing. So I had it for a while, but at my Community college, I never used the extended testing time. And then I and then, when i've had it with cal state fullerton since i've been there for the past two semesters i've used the longer testing time, but it was all online, so it wasn't I was just like in my own little zoom room. Okay, but now that we're back on campus I had to use the DSS like testing room okay out of the classroom. While everyone else is taking the test. Which. I so i'm i'm really observant and I don't know if that comes from having anxiety and just you know be really aware of my surroundings. But I i've noticed when I have noticed when people aren't there on test days and i'm like okay they're taking them in DSS and that's not a bad thing, in my head. And it's like it's just like a fat other a DSS but. I absolutely hate the fact that I wasn't that because I have not friends and classes, but I have people I talked to you like each day. And we all sit in the same seats. So phil have noticed that I wasn't there on test days and if you're there every other day, except for test days, where else, are you. And I know this is all in my head and I like so like being ashamed that. I, and I was talking with my boyfriend about this and I think I know why i'm worried that people will think i'm not as smart, as I am, because I get help. Like Oh, she wouldn't be as smart, as she is if she wasn't you know getting the extra you know testing time and you know that extra help. Sure um but then why is being so smart than most important thing it's not you know, but like, why is it so important in my head that people. perceive that i'm smart."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11476.0,Patient,I don't know why. So.
527.0,Provider,Is there any comparison to your sister.
11476.0,Patient,I mean i'm sure i'm sure I wouldn't be surprised. But.
527.0,Provider,What does smart me. Like for you.
11476.0,Patient,"I guess like smart in my like school setting is. Are answering questions like voluntarily or. Like being the person that people ask notes from. I don't know it's I was gonna say it's stupid, but I mean it's important to me and or no, I guess, I don't know why it's so important that I be perceived that way. I get I guess it's because I don't know I really like English and all my classes are English if it was a math class i'd be like, so I have no idea what we're doing. Like I I. Because I recognize i'm really only smart in one subjects like math science, I cannot do. um so I don't really I don't think I had to take a science class like a year and a half ago and I I don't think I cared as much because i'm like I don't get this stuff. Okay, but I guess maybe because I care about the subject, and I really enjoy the subject that like. I don't know I want people to think that, like. i'm just the best English i'm the best reader i'm the best one I don't know. And i'm sure I do plenty to make people think i'm not smart so i'm sure like it's not you know it's not i'm sure so but i'm really I don't know I i'm realized i'm really concerned with. If I come off as smart or not. Because that's I mean I, it also could be shamed of you, I mean from having to deal with anxiety and OCD and. Right like having like. And I don't know, maybe i'm also paranoid that people are talking about me but I mean who really talks about people like you know it's not I highly doubt college aged people will be like a general wasn't DSS like whoo kind of thing yeah so. I don't know like is that, where does that, where does that paranoia come from is that anxiety what is that."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I also just hear you just struggling you've mentioned shame like numerous times like that seems like your go to feeling for yourself like and maybe that's maybe that's the place to explore like what. What is my shame like what what am I carrying That is my shame. Because what's your alternative if you're not perceived as smart why I mean what's the what's the alternative you're dumb you're stupid."
11476.0,Patient,yeah I guess I like.
527.0,Provider,That is that that black and white.
11476.0,Patient,"I guess in the way I see people it is. or when someone says something I remember it. So i'm like Oh, they said something stupid and class like I don't I guess i'm really judgmental but I don't think I really am it's like I don't know I don't know. We don't I think it's like my own i'm judging myself based on others I don't know."
527.0,Provider,Well that's what I was going to ask like are you projecting your own feelings about yourself and seeing them and others. yeah you're like look like just disgusted and you know irritated with with their actions when.
11476.0,Patient,Like I see the worst of. myself in them. mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,"because sometimes that happens, like we see that mirror of ourselves and we're like, why is that person like such under my skin well Is there something that they're doing that is. relatable to me and and or something that i'm I don't like within myself either, and so I see it, and somebody you know and it kind of puts it back real in my face like. But, but I also you know I kind of want to go back to you know when you were happy using using the opiates like what what person were you then jenna and like what how have things shifted for you and who are you without that piece."
11476.0,Patient,"um I mean, I know that my boyfriend was going to leave me with like, not if I stayed on it, but because of like how I acted. I mean not I don't want to say, like, I was so high that I don't remember, but like I don't I remember being happy, I remember having fun. So. And I, and I was doing great and I was on it like I was going to school working almost like full time. Everything crashed when I. got off of them. Okay, and everyone else was happy like my parents like they said, like my I wasn't so angry all the time and then I that my boyfriend he was like so much happier I wouldn't so argumentative. And i'm like well great for you guys I feel like shit."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11476.0,Patient,"um yeah so that was hard, but I mean like I said it's gotten better it's not like that you know extreme euphoria all the time it's like obs but i'm not completely feel like I have no happiness in life, either. But the question is like does it get better than this, I don't know like. I don't know."
527.0,Provider,Is there any grieving about that process.
11476.0,Patient,"yeah i'm i'm mad like i'm. I know that I can't just take them. Because like. I it's it's it's not as Mrs me trying to rationalize that I wasn't on a high crazy dose I wasn't injecting and I wasn't buying them off the street, so you know this is me trying to rationalize it. So. And I guess, I mean my my parents, they drink every single day, and according to online five or more drinks, a week you're an alcoholic. So in my brain it's like it, I don't know still I guess I, I guess, they made them legal if you could buy them like the way you can buy them at a weed dispensary I would. Like they. i'm just angry that I can't have like one device, you know Okay, but I get it, I understand, like the long term effects, and you know they. To the you also you can't get them now, so people go to other drugs, but you know. They do eat away at your liver and kind of things I get they have like long term effects and stuff. Sure, but it is just still me being a light acting like a petulant child and just being like Why can I. Life is so much nicer."
527.0,Provider,Like okay.
11476.0,Patient,"But I mean I also had like even worse migraines with them, so you know that's why I had to get off from because, like you know it was pointless. So i'm sure i'm i'm remembering it better than it was. And like I said, but people around me hated me, you know, so it. have to do something I have to do is to give a little bit right, you know."
527.0,Provider,yeah sounds like i've lost my coping mechanisms for happiness and now i'm pissed like. yeah yeah.
11476.0,Patient,"And I guess annoyed that everyone knows like not like. I mean my parents knew that I was like on suboxone and stuff my sister knows that I was on opiates and that I had headaches and that I needed help getting off of them, but she doesn't know like how much I love them and, like that kind of stuff. yeah I guess that's where I am realizing a lot of my. frustrations, with people I noticed after that, like when they made me do groups, then I absolutely hated them, and I would think like i'm so much better than these people like I. I I didn't sleep on the streets, I didn't sell my body for drugs. i'm you know I just I just like the pills my doctor gave me a little too much so, which isn't what I really think I mean i'm an addiction is a it's a disease that it doesn't matter what that was my rock bottom right my you know. shows my version of rock bottom it's still rock bottom um. yeah so I guess that like anger. And now I I. angry towards everyone Okay, maybe not verbally all the time, but like. I just got I tried to think of myself as not being judgmental but I guess, I really arrogant sides it's only when I see things that I, you know I would hate to see in myself Okay, that I really get judgmental. Because I like to think of myself but i'm not like I don't judge people for big things, but I could see that it, it may just be things that I think like oh that's the worst version of me and i'm seeing. Like what how awful I think I am. I don't know God sorry trying to like be introspective."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean it's certainly too, I think, maybe explore and do some journaling on for yourself like. yeah because it sounds like I mean that was that was an impactful time of your life like it shifted drastically then."
11476.0,Patient,"I know for the better, I like rational. Rational me knows for the better. yeah but you know emotional me just like. It just those didn't like and my boyfriend when he had to have surgery he didn't he hated taking them and i'm just like you suck you really suck like I just know they work with my body chemistry. You know, and I just. I feel like star crossed lovers i've told my boyfriend that like. We love each other so much, but we can't be together."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11476.0,Patient,"So I yeah I guess I haven't been that happy, since then, but again I could be you know i'm sure i'm remembering it better than it was."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I mean it was an."
11476.0,Patient,Artificial happiness yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah too, so I think we have to just acknowledge that. But what uh let you know what was I feeling at that time to that that was my goat you know that was my I found that that was a go to that that helped me, even if it was an artificial happiness like. You still weren't feeling good."
11476.0,Patient,mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,"You know the you know if we you know if we take the norco out of the picture like it obviously altered your mood so that you felt good. yeah so you know what you know when did that, like not feeling good start."
11476.0,Patient,Like before. I mean God. I don't know. How far back.
527.0,Provider,"Right well and that's you know and part of that is like you know what what did I need my family to understand about me, you know that my thoughts are my. Feelings how I process things or my anger, you know my anxiety or the shame that I carry like. What is what is wrong with me what is wrong with China, like."
11476.0,Patient,I gotta want to say something like this big enigma but I don't think they get it.
527.0,Provider,that's.
11476.0,Patient,"A lot of stuff like I, like my my parents, they both suffered sexual abuse, when they were not as young as me but. But i'm young teens and. I mean, maybe I guess maybe because it doesn't affect them in the same way that I see it, is not affecting them. So, like I said i'm not this big enigma it's not like you know all these like it. I don't know, maybe I like they're handling things better so."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, but again, you just shot yourself down a little bit. I know."
11476.0,Patient,"I mean, I always."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. So I yeah yeah I want you, I want you just to stop there, and I want you to just really be genuine and speak what you want, heard jenna your story what needs to be heard, and I don't want any like dismissals I want I want truth of feelings and thoughts. And not trying to justify or dismiss that."
11476.0,Patient,"I mean, I think my mom needs to realize like that it's her father's fault like that this happened, like that. And i'm going to say it, you know it's not her fault but. So i'm not trying to i'll stop sorry i'm that."
527.0,Provider,You needed to feel safe. yeah yeah you needed protected.
11476.0,Patient,"It wasn't hurt she. It wasn't because she wasn't protecting me, but in that moment I don't know I don't know God I don't God that's such a. topic for a huge another day yeah. yeah like I said I don't even know where to start like being unhappy, but then i'm that's where the anxiety started. Where compulsion started. Yes, i'm."
527.0,Provider,OK.
11476.0,Patient,So that's what I mean I don't even know when to say like when I was happy because i've had anxiety and compulsions like sense but that's also my earliest memory so like I think all my memories. Have.
527.0,Provider,"anxiety and compulsion yeah yeah. So maybe it's maybe it's starting my my life story, and you start wherever you need to start just be honest with with it and we'll we'll take it a step at a time for you."
11476.0,Patient,"So, like, I really struggle with the fact that because I wasn't fully fully rate that it's not valid, and I know it is."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11476.0,Patient,"I know it is like, and if someone else told me that to me like you know when everything if someone else told it to me like that's still very significant that's still very traumatizing like."
527.0,Provider,"But it matters. It matters to you, and it matter."
11476.0,Patient,yeah but it that it wasn't. It was it I shouldn't my parents both experienced full on rate so like Why am I struggling with something that wasn't even half as bad as that. yeah I I I am shameful of my tolerance level. Of like i've been able to handle things I feel like I can't handle things that other people can and are handling better than me. So I yeah I guess.
527.0,Provider,"it's important I mean I think that's that needs to be it needs to be understood, it needs to be heard, I mean that's your story it's not anybody else's there's no comparison of mines worse or better than the other persons or not, the same that experience was significant. And played significantly into your life and how things have been."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah and I think, because it happened when I was young, too. So that in like. that's for a long day. yeah for another hour session yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I want you just as you're writing I want you to pause when you need to pause like if you notice you're trying to like. negate or dismiss you know, maybe that's the time just to go okay we're just going to pause right now and then i'll come back to it when I can really be present, with my thoughts and my feelings. And my voice okay. Yes, I don't want you to just try and to push through it, I want you to be you know kind of mindful and and take breaks when you need to because it is emotionally hard work and and, and again I want you to be able to you know be open and in direct with yourself, first and foremost like. Like your words do matter and they're going to be heard."
