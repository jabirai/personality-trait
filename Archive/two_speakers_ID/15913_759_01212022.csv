No longer a relationship, but I didn't ask and he didn't say anything so I don't know. But yeah so yeah outside of that i'm. still trying to finalize all these this. Trust and we'll. Get health care directive documents and all that stuff. But it's it's the at least the process was started and it's kind of in the works and. Okay yeah. figuring all that stuff out, so I feel like my. To do list has been kind of less lately, which is really nice because I I I always feel like when i'm here with the kids like overwhelmed sometimes because I have so much that I want to do, or that I need. To do and then dealing with them at the same time. So yeah the projects it's kind of. slowed down and minimize."

Even though I have guards and like you know helmets and all this.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"Just kind of like yeah I think I might be better off on some roller skates now that she's taken over my skateboard. So, or a scooter. Somebody somebody was posting and. So, like the by nothing Facebook groups group that they had lawyers and stuff and I was like. I don't like the more the adult version because. She has a scooter that I was kind of rolling around on but it's like the kid version. So I was like oh that could work too."

15913.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
759.0,Provider,Okay okay. feel so I know you. Give me a quick section session you just feel like I just had to tell you i'm doing okay Nada. Nothing else.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah Oh well, I was so my I was trying to help out my sister. Her and I are hurting or close and that we can talk to each other about anything but we don't talk very often. I think I mentioned before, like she just has a very different lifestyle she's two years older than me. You know she's been living in New York and New Jersey, for a long time, and she just has a very wild party lifestyle no kids. She had a partner that she'd been with for a few years but they're kind of splitting up. she's having a hard time and she actually moved down to Florida, to get out of the cold and kind of away from him. So I think, because she was doing therapy and she was talking about, like, I want to be done with them, but she has all this guilt, because his mom passed away. Even though. She was sick for years and he's like an only child so she's basically his emotional support system and i'm like. yeah i'm like you gotta you gotta cut that like unless unless you feel like you're okay with. be friends, but that doesn't sound like a good idea, you know. So she was she sounded to me like she was like waiting on her therapist to be like yes do this, you have. and honestly I don't think they're gonna do that I was like Do I need to do that, so I was like I will I will tell you."
759.0,Provider,I would tell you that yeah so I was.
15913.0,Patient,"Trying to be more directive of like like because she like I wouldn't be so directive if she hadn't said herself like I am i'm over it, I want to be done with it i'm ready, you know to to kind of move on from it. But I think she just feels really bad all all her stuff is still at his house so she's got to figure out a way to get her stuff out of there. And then I think kind of just cut communication. But we were kind of working out a way she can she can make that happen. But I was like well I don't know yeah when he's not there, just as she doesn't have to deal with it, but I was like. Well, if you do that when he's not there, then you're going to have to have a plan of communicating something at some point. that's good to know you know. yeah that you went and got all your stuff out of there. But uh. yeah I was, I guess, being a therapist on that for her."
759.0,Provider,"Well, she can be there for her you know."
15913.0,Patient,"yeah but she's still I think she's just struggling with depression, because she was asking me like when's this going to be over, and I was like What do you mean. it's gonna be over, when you when you want it to be over, when you say it's over, but then I think what she meant more because she makes it sound like it's unrelated to him because she's like i'm not with him, I talked to him, we talked you know we tax, we talk. But just in dealing with being. 40 how old is she 43 almost 44 and being single again. yeah at that age and then she's a very social person so she doesn't you know deal too well with being alone and and all that."
759.0,Provider,yourself yeah.
15913.0,Patient,yeah so. I don't know.
759.0,Provider,"So it sounds like you're being emotional support so it's you know sibling to her and like system to her in terms of you know, like taking on the role of yeah i'm going to tell you, if you're a therapist is not going to tell you i'm going to tell you."
15913.0,Patient,"You know you gotta leave I was like oh wait on your therapist to tell you, you need. you've already said it to me that you want to do this, you need to formulate a plan and and make it happen it's not good for you know it's not good for you, because I thought she was done with their relationship, a while ago, and then it kept. dragging on and yeah. yeah so i'm hoping. That this is because he came to visitor for Christmas and I was just like what was going on why Why is he you know why is there still communication and contact like just. Add it."
759.0,Provider,yeah just cut it.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah but. yeah hopefully and then. Oh, I was telling I was telling Dominique this in group yesterday. cuz because whenever they start talking about letting go of control and stuff like that and. The one thing that happened earlier this week my mom. And i've done this in the past, so like I woke up with a headache and I just wasn't feeling good all day was kind of just like is this hormonal my back's hurting like what's going on, and of course my stress is a little bit up because i'm like oh God I got in co bed like."
759.0,Provider,I know yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"Even with the minimal contact that I have Oh, the guy that I ran into like kind of like tried to hug me and before I knew it, I was like Okay, you know it's all."
759.0,Provider,gone away yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"I didn't realize. For a hug like who comes in for a hug in the middle Armor you know i'm recon I was kind of like Oh, but he he turned his head away, I was like. yeah but still. I was like oh my God I would be so mortified test it's like he gave me covert or something you know anyway um. yeah I think i'm just going to be like put my fist up to fist bump. Like immediately if I you know this. This book this book but um. yeah so no so I wasn't feeling good and I talked to my mom at the end of the day, and it turns out, she woke up with a headache and wasn't feeling good because she's going through chemo for breast cancer. Oh it's a low dose and there was. We didn't actually think she was going to have to even do chemo we thought she would do radiation like she did before, so this happened, like 15 years ago where. She had a lump and they did a lump back to me, and then they did some radiation, and it was done, and so we thought this was kind of going to kind of be the same thing, it was in the other breast. yeah. But it turned out that her chances of it reoccurring were lowered by like. 10 or 20 10% maybe if she did some chemo and so she's got like four four rounds of it to do. Oh yeah so you know she's lost her hair she's not feeling well. yeah and that day that was happening, and so I and i've done this in the past with my dad when my dad ended up in jail, I felt his guilt and I was like processing his emotions. yeah, and so I was like oh man I i'm tuning into my mom and what's going on with her. musically without even thinking about it or knowing it, you know it's. it's something that it's almost like kind of happens like automatic."
759.0,Provider,You have things like that. You know it's unexplainable but it's kind of like you take on kind of like.
15913.0,Patient,The pain take on other people's processes.
759.0,Provider,Processes you.
15913.0,Patient,Know yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Now, like it's it's kind of like it's unexplainable bar, you can explain into stand, but then it's kind of like you know why is this happening or whatever, but it does, I feel like it does happen more often than we do."
15913.0,Patient,"yeah well I did I did an energy work session along when I when that happened with me with my dad because I didn't know what was going on, I just knew that like I felt, you know I felt guilty, I felt like all the things. She said she said, so this is like an ancient thing that used to happen in the villages, when the men would go out to hunt, the women would take on the emotional processes of the men, so that they could focus on the hunt and the reward was that they brought back food, you know. So she's like you know there's no obviously that doesn't. That. You don't get a reward you know. For for doing that, at this. At this point, and it's actually better for that person to process fully process their own Karma or. Whatever it is you're taking away from their process basically by. Doing that you know it's not helpful like it you like it used to be. So yeah I kind of have to. be like Okay, I can still be like empathetic and helpful but give that back to her. yeah I don't even know what i'm doing i'm doing it when it's. kind of like oh like. This doesn't feel good you know um so yeah. So that happened earlier in the week and I told her that I was like I was like wait you woke up with a headache because I woke up with a headache so i'm feeling, whatever your feelings I don't."
759.0,Provider,feel good.
15913.0,Patient,"Today, either you know. and not to the full extent she is i'm sure it's just some of it yeah oh."
759.0,Provider,yeah some of it.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah but yeah so apparently that was going on. But hopefully it's not the same, with my sister. Because you know I have my own Depression and anxiety so. I don't need to be picking up on hers thinking it's mine."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"But no, no she's she's feeling it and stuff so and she's doing what she needs to do she's just like When does it end. yeah I. don't know yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Well, yes she's doing what she needs to do you know, like in terms of this guy hopefully she's going to be able to stick. To what she needs to do in order to just break it off the relationship and shepherd that's what needs to be done, you know, in terms of of how she feels about it, or you know, like going into separate. and hopefully she can do that for herself and move on. yeah."
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, I hope, so I would imagine. I mean I don't know."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"it's kind of interesting how a depression comes on and then how it kind of goes away and. I don't really know what. makes it do that, like i've had the experience of like it's come on all of a sudden don't really know why, and then, like all of a sudden it's like okay it's kind of gone, you know. it's hard to say but."
759.0,Provider,"Sometimes, it can be circumstantial you know, like circumstances that happen, sometimes it can be an imbalance of having low serotonin in your brain. You re. In that pain and not getting getting proper nutrients like vitamin D, so it could be a physical aspect of it and then also a mental you know aspect of it, you know, in terms of. Maybe there's a situation or circumstances that make you feel press are you know, like you'd, be it can be a combination. You know yeah it's hard to say what you know actually."
15913.0,Patient,What is it the it's the it's mostly the vitamin D. As far as when it's a nutritional thing.
759.0,Provider,"vitamin D. I think it's mostly vitamin D. I know, like people have other deficiencies in environments, but I think is most of what I hear is that a lot of people are low environment or five and D deficient. na and doctors encouraged, you know vitamin D, as far as you know, like getting sunlight or you know by guard kicking the vitamin supplement, but I hear that that cause that can cause, you know someone to feel kind of down in though you know in. terms of yeah yeah."
15913.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I. I tried to take mine i'm not never good at remembering remember i'm good at remembering to give my son his meds so I should probably take mine, at the same time, but I also hate swallowing pills, so I haven't even the even the tiniest little ones, so I have a reluctance to."
759.0,Provider,To even do that yeah.
15913.0,Patient,The I should I should make sure she's because I know her nutrition hasn't been the greatest with she has ulcerative colitis so she's. suffered with that for a long time so i'm sure there's deficiencies and stuff there but.
759.0,Provider,"yeah that's why we kind of have you guys here bright heart health, do you like the labs. yeah and see exactly what's going on with your blood work, making you see if you, you know what you're deficient in and and kind of like give you the full like consultation on that oh yeah."
15913.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,yeah So what has it been it hasn't been kind of you feeling down lately or does low some days are into some days.
15913.0,Patient,"I felt Okay, overall, I mean like my energy can always be higher, or better I don't I don't really ever want to get up on not like i'm asleep in person."
759.0,Provider,"You like to sleep in. Love no sleep, no. don't play on yeah."
15913.0,Patient,"So you know, at one point pete was kind of on my case because the kids would be running around the House and i'm in bed still. But. And then he would kind of be having to get up and deal with them instead of getting off to work and i'm like just go i'll deal with it, you know, like. But he hasn't really gotten I think I think he's realized it's not going to be."
759.0,Provider,yeah he knows you by now yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"There you kind of hasn't gotten on my case about it but he's also working from home right now so or like he'll he'll still leave and go find the quieter space that he can work in. But he'll stick around in the mornings, and you know, sometimes he did come in the other day and say okay I I gotta get some work done and they're driving me crazy, and so I had to get up and handle it but. Then, most of the time I do anyway, when he leaves the House, you know i'm like look, this is this is how I do it, you know they're. they're not in any danger like they're fine yeah. At some point, I know that I have to get up and start. Getting schoolwork stuff done and make sure they've eaten breakfast and all that but. yeah. I feel a little guilty, I guess, for. kind of laying around in bed, but I am i've never been a morning person i'm."
759.0,Provider,"Not a morning person why even to will you know, like in terms of yeah."
15913.0,Patient,"yeah but you know and it's going to change when she started school because we're going to have to get up earlier and i'm going to have to like driver and drop her off at school and stuff and. And, which is fine, we did it the first four days, but she was in school before we pulled her out so like you know it'll. It will happen, and it will change, but for now i'm actually enjoying and actually my youngest slept in with me today until around eight something so. Okay yeah sometimes he's up and out of bed before I even wake up making a mess, but. Luckily, our houses, I have every all the furniture and stuff like bolted, to the walls. Is a very childproof and. Nice yeah and it's a small house, so I can hear what's happening. um but. yeah I don't know I stay up late, I like to think then."
759.0,Provider,"Do what feels good for you, you know, like in terms because you got a lot on your plate with the kids so you know, like I think it's important for you to get you know proper rest and and do what feels natural to."
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah well we we switched it up so or four year old he was napping sometimes. And I i'd wake up from a nap after a while, because I didn't want him to nap too long, and then it got to where waking him up was just like a challenge and a struggle. And then, even after waking them up he'd be like up super late at night, you know, so we decided to try. getting them to bed earlier because I think what would happen is even on the days, he didn't nap we weren't really putting him to bed earlier, we were just kind of putting both kids to bed at the same time and she's older."
759.0,Provider,"So he doesn't need as much sleep, as he does so I was like okay well if we can actually get him to bed, you know lights out at 715."
15913.0,Patient,"Then, maybe the NAPs stop, and they have and he's finally sleeping through the night, the first. I think the second maybe the second or third night he was away from like 1030 to 430. which was my fear I was like oh he's going to go to bed early and then he's just going to be awake in the middle of the night for a few hours. yeah but luckily I think he's gotten used to it and he's he's mostly slept through or if he did wake up, he didn't he wasn't up for like an hour in the middle of the night he would he would go back to sleep. So that was good, because. it's been a while, since i've. been up in the middle of the night with the kids you know."
759.0,Provider,yeah. cuz how this is the youngest.
15913.0,Patient,Is four so.
759.0,Provider,"yeah so it's been a while, since you had to you know be you know, a baby, you know up in the."
15913.0,Patient,"middle of the night yeah. And then I already go to bed late so like you know if i'm in bed at midnight and then he wakes up at three and he's up to. I don't even know how long I kind of I went to the clock and i'm like three something and then he just sometimes will be up for like an hour, but I like don't turn lights on, I don't do anything I just foggy lay down on he laid out. Just kind of try to stay, you know snooze through it and he'll stay in bed. Then he'll just. Be flopping around doing whatever it is, he does so. So that's not fun, but. yeah I think I think he's getting. More used to it he's still a bit of a grump in the evening with them and melts down a little bit easier and quicker than he would otherwise if he'd had a nap earlier, but you know I think we're just gonna have to kind of deal deal with that a little bit, but."
759.0,Provider,we've been getting them.
15913.0,Patient,"to bed, you know at seven with light felt like at 715 and stuff so. yeah and then she stays up a little bit a little bit longer, and you know get some alone time with dad and stuff because I still lay down with him to put him to bed. we're trying to get she's almost seven and she's like our kids are just snuggle bugs they just want to be in the beds with us. Oh yeah so we we haven't slept in the same bed, and a very long time. and And I don't I wouldn't be able to sleep if he wasn't in the room, with us because of the issues with croup and waking up in the middle of the night. When a narrow airway and stuff and at one point I had like a toddler bed in the room, and I was trying to get them, at least in his own little bed, and never worked and. So he's basically him basically in the bed with me and then peace days in the other room, because our six year old. We just started getting her back to where she'll lay down on her own, and you can say goodnight and turn off the light and leave the room, whereas before he'd have to lay with her. So we're kind of a little bit back on track with that, but then she'll still wake up in the middle of the night and go crawling back with him so to avoid having all four of us in the same head. Yes, he sleeps in the other room because i'm like look, you can freak in here with augie but she's gonna come crawling bed like i'm not i'm not doing that, until she stays at her bed all night because it's too. out it's. Like auggie likes to sleep sideways I already get pushed to the edge, with just him in the bed, you know and then we've got four people in here, I was like no way. Though it's not the best for our relationship, but you know it's the best for the kids right now, and you know, hopefully she'll get back to a point where she's sleeping in her bedroom we've gotten her there at one point. And then I think my mom came to visit or something, and she wanted to sleep with her grandma and and they."
759.0,Provider,got her back off track yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"It kind of got her back off track, but mainly pete got her back off track because she'd be like go to sleep with that and he's she's a daddy's girl. And he caved and I was like oh. Like we had her there you know she was Tucker and good night leaves the room. But you know he's the one who has to deal with it so i'm like look you're the one who either has to lay down with her to get her to sleep or deal with her crawl into bed with you in the middle of the night so like it's up to you, you know but you're not coming back in and my dad and. Until crawling in with us. yeah well, so one step at a time and then yeah I don't know what's going to happen with with auggie. mm hmm honestly I would I would define if. If we had like a another like a toddler bed, or even a twin bed, and our our room for him least he'd be in the room, but that out of the bed."
759.0,Provider,But yeah can kind of keep an eye on his breathing right.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah or if we had a good monitor you know and the room if eventually he'd be in his own room, I would, I think I would be okay with setting up a monitor that way I can hear. Yes, have it on at night, so I could hear, if anything, you know happened because he would typically wake up and cough and he'd have. The barking cough is you know what you would hear. So that's a possibility but that's who knows how far off."
759.0,Provider,far off destined to be.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So it'll be nice though and. They are they are in their own rooms and then. Also, out of. diapers they're both still in nighttime diapers. she's never woken up with like a dry diaper so I don't know how to get her out of."
759.0,Provider,It yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"Yes, I think she just has a small bladder because, for the longest time she'd like you know josie go to the bathroom Okay, then we get in the car and like literally 15 minutes later I gotta go the bathroom. bathroom. Oh, my gosh like we can't stop every 15 minutes you know. yeah yeah. So you know, I have a party in my car and she's done and her pants would always get wet. So she actually she finally stopped doing that. And and she's able to hold it longer now but she's doing nighttime diapers and she's almost like seven years old. So I don't know."
759.0,Provider,yeah i'm trying to figure out what to do.
15913.0,Patient,"And yeah I have a little potty and putting it in in the room and i've told her like Okay, if you get up to go crawl in bed with dad go potty you know, in the middle of the night and and i'm sure we should be cutting off her drinking her water intake and some point. She drinks a ton of water and I love it like I want her to."
759.0,Provider,drink water.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah cuz i'm terrible at it, I don't know why I don't like drinking plain water i'll like i'll put juice and like water it down a ton. And even then, like my water and take it. Like I definitely need to have that and i've always known that i've always the bad at it um but yeah so I really love it that she's like. down all the kind of water yeah. But everybody says like Oh, you should you should cut them off at a certain point in the evening, you know that way they can make it through the night I don't know her diapers are so full I don't even know if cutting it if it would help."
759.0,Provider,yeah we can try. You can always try and.
15913.0,Patient,"see how it goes she's old enough to understand that now and I talked to her about trying to get out of the the diapers so. we'll see how it goes I also don't want to deal with what she says and. mattresses and all that stuff. So. yeah. Sometimes it's easier, just to let them. Stay deal with it for longer than you want to and. grow out of it at some point, I would assume."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15913.0,Patient,Right.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah Hopefully she will grow out there yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"Well, I think, her dad was a bed wetter until late."
759.0,Provider,Oh.
15913.0,Patient,"Is what i've heard so I don't know. that's that's that's the case so just stay in them for a long time, I guess it's not that the only the only thing with it is the extra expense, you know."
759.0,Provider,giving you like denied time papers yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah because they have them, for you know young kids and kids who. For adult ones to, I guess, I suppose, once they're big enough, you can use something like that you know. yeah. yeah. So. Those are some of the."
759.0,Provider,The challenges and things that you go through with. yeah.
15913.0,Patient,Korea struggles challenges.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"No, not terrible that."
759.0,Provider,"Still still kind of like you know, like you want to, I can see how you know, like yeah having sleeping with augie you know you want to monitor him but also you know the downfall is like pete you know the sleeping with pete you know, like wine to have that closeness and. yeah like in terms of Fino sleeping with him at night. But yeah you know happening for people in the bed that sounds like a lot."
15913.0,Patient,It is.
759.0,Provider,"You know, even though i'm pretty sure it's kind of fun at times you know, like maybe it's not fun I don't know but. Maybe having all four of you guys I don't know, maybe, at times, but not every night, you know."
15913.0,Patient,"not now, not well he likes to sleep completely sideways on the bed. It doesn't work. And so I did. I end up at the foot of the bed, as what happened."
759.0,Provider,Oh wow. Oh wow.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we have a king, but it's not a California king. So it's not as wide as it could be, we probably should have gotten to California king, I guess, but. yeah it doesn't it doesn't work so. Which is fine it'll be more of. More. Of. For her to like be enter you know, a reason for her to be in her own room, so we don't all fit in here just busy and mom and we did that at one point we were like look mom and dad need to sleep say that. Again, and that's not going to happen with you crawling in the bed with dad because we don't fit in this bed in here so."
759.0,Provider,"yeah this telling her lucky this you know just giving yeah I think sometimes kids on I mean they might not totally understand I think they understand enough, you know my."
15913.0,Patient,"She does she she tends to be more motivated when she feels like she's helping you. know are doing a favor kind of for you in that in that way you know, like she is more thoughtful. about it, or you know willing and trying to do. Something when it's like oh okay this helps mom and dad out or you know something like that, like we were talking she was asking about how much lights costs to have them on it like like we have to pay for electricity and. As I keep telling all he likes to go outside and play in the water hose and in the water, and he goes into the laundry room sinking like washes all his trucks and i'm like auggie, we have to pay for this water like stop here. So she's kind of grasping that these things we use, you know cost money and we have to pay for them and stuff like that so. When she found out she was like oh. I better go turn my light off my art laughing i'm like. yeah I was like but. She was trying to contribute she's like well, I have some money, I can you know, to pay for the bills. So I was like well let's not like you leave that up to mom and dad to worry about I don't want her getting caught up in. That yeah the thing because. I grew I grew up with parents struggling with money and. overheard and yeah like it was it was a worry, you know. For me, I remember being having friends over for like sleep overs and then then getting into over food and stuff and being like they're going to eat our food, you know, and it was on my mind, because I knew like oh we're struggling. You know, financially and stuff like that and. I didn't want my friends coming over and eating our food."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah so you don't want that to be her reality and he sort of way.
15913.0,Patient,"No, I don't want her to worry about that at all so. I was trying to teach her without also having her like you know worry about it or stress out about it. yeah, though. yeah. What else."
759.0,Provider,"What else has been going on, what else you want to talk about."
15913.0,Patient,"No, no. there's still always the struggle with. My dad the relationship with my dad. I don't talk to him that much, but when I do talk to them it's like talking to a brick wall you just get like no reactions are like no feedback and. The last time I think I talked to him. And he's like all right, well, I gotta go get a snack before the game, you know and i'm like dude I hardly ever talk to you, and then the one time we're like on the phone and now's your opportunity. To talk to me like. The important thing for him is making sure he gets a snack before the game starts. So Okay, whatever fine bye."
759.0,Provider,"yeah it's like you tried, you know, to communicate with him and but he was more concerned about a snack and then talking to you sounds like."
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean it's a tricky situation he's lives in Georgia. And when we go to break when we go to Alabama which has been a long time with coven. Sometimes he'll he'll drive out and we'll kind of see him. yeah but it's a six hour drive for him. it's a it's a little bit challenging because what do you need bud. Okay, Peter, can you grab this stuff and do it out there. Peter, can you get get his stuff and do it out there. Okay. Take that stuff to dad okay okie sleepy. we're relatively big as i'm going to stay up all."
759.0,Provider,he's not sleeping.
15913.0,Patient,"Well, he has he. Has he has these pajamas that say i'm not sleepy. that's that's what he was picking out and he said i'm not sleeping because i'm going to stay up all night. But yeah so we'll kind of he's not really he's not welcome at my mom's house anymore. was at one point after you know they divorced and we'd be in town and she let them come over and she let him stay. At one point, and then he just was acted inappropriately to my young cousin and when we were out to dinner at like my uncle's restaurant, with all the family there. So I think that was the last straw for my mom and she was. Like i'm done. I tried to be nice about it, you know for for. For me and my sister. She trying to be like Okay, you know he can come over and he can stay but. That doesn't happen anymore, so he has to go stay in a hotel and then we have to like meet him somewhere. That we can like hang out. So it's just awkward. And I feel bad because he, like drives for six hours, and then we see him not very much and. mommy on yeah and then we used to kind of meet halfway. But it's still a six hour round trip for two people you know yeah and then we've got young kids so doing that in one day it's just not feasible, so if he wants to see us then he has to drive out there. And he's mentioned coming out here before which none of this is going to happen during COPA so it's not it's not a worry for me right now. yeah the future I don't really know how to handle it because. I don't want him staying with me."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15913.0,Patient,"Even though we have space like he's. You know he's a registered sex offender he went to prison for talking to people under age online. And in fact he was talking to FBI agents who intercepted him when he cross state lines to potentially meet up with someone who said they were under age. kind of like a kick to catch a predator kind of thing. So he's ever been caught actually doing anything and growing up, he never did anything inappropriate to my sister I. mean he always he always kind of acted like a dirty old man, but. You never actually did anything. with us, and then you know he didn't get caught doing anything. But he had a child pornography on his computer. That was apparently organized into folders. It wasn't you know, so it wasn't just like a oops I accidentally downloaded that kind of thing. And he was talking to somebody online, who was saying they were under age, you know and and going to meet up with that person. So I don't really I don't want I don't want him in my house with my kids you know, and I don't even know if I really want him around them at all for that much like I would maybe go have dinner in a public place. in a public place around what other people. yeah but."
759.0,Provider,I know it's just being too intimate you know in terms. yeah having him in close pug mix it up to your children yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't want that around since he acted and appropriate towards my cousin who's not a child, she she's she was, I mean I don't remember how old she was at the time she was definitely a teenager you know, but still for a man that age to. act that way towards. You know somebody who's still a young very young person. who's a family member with the family members around was just. Really yeah really weird and awkward and. So. yeah, this is a. challenging situation and I think at one point I talked to my sister and was like okay. You know dad wants to visit like you would have to come out and like manage him like you guys could stay in a hotel somewhere and, if you would have to manage that situation, because then otherwise he's like on his own out here staying somewhere else and. I don't know I don't know how to do it, I don't really want to he lives on a dirt road and like really, really rural southern Georgia. I took pete there one time before we had kids and we stayed and visited and stuff and typically when I go I ends up helping him fix his house up. Because he has this really old farmhouse and like we. Actually, when he when he went to prison for five years, he told us he cleaned up the House and then, when he got out, I went to pick them up and took him to his house. And he basically walked out. The front door you didn't do anything to that house. So we had to take everything out of every room. wipe down the walls, like everything had there was rat's nest everywhere Luckily, there were no live rats I don't know what I don't know what happened, they all left before he got back, but we were. Cleaning that stuff. out and cleaning up, and you know dealing with. All of that, and so you know, since i've since i've been back in the past, like one time, I was like you got to get this carpet out of here, there was like two layers of carpet. because somebody was lazy and put new carpet over the old stuff instead of taking it out, and so we you know, and there were beautiful hardwoods underneath it i'm like wow this is. This is awesome. So I helped him do like doing that and just what with whatever. Luckily, he actually signed up for this program where they help people low income like do stuff, and so they came in actually did a bunch of stuff to the House. yeah. yeah because we really need to keep you know it's he has to pay taxes on the land and utilities and stuff but. Those are his only expenses like it's the House that he grew up in it was his parents house and stuff so it's you know it's paid for its own do we really want to keep a roof over his head there."
759.0,Provider,"So you kind of you know, make sure that he's taking care of you know."
15913.0,Patient,"yeah and. yeah exactly because then, otherwise I don't I don't know he got a job at one point. It was actually doing some work and then they let him go I don't really know what happened there. it's."
759.0,Provider,A fixed income now like the social security. yeah yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, and I refuse to send him money because I don't trust him with it. He actually when I was a kid emptied my bank account. To pay for his car."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15913.0,Patient,"And then before he told me he was going to pay me back and then before he paid me back he went out bought himself a motorcycle and I was like i'm excuse me, you still owe me money."
759.0,Provider,Honey yeah you're buying yourself a motorcycle like what. I was.
15913.0,Patient,"I was passed. yeah yeah so and I see this stuff he you know he he waste money on basically he's he's always done that, like go all out on. i'm gonna hunt, and we had all this hunting gear in the garage that he never used any photo that he never used, and he has a boat in his front yard right now with grass growing all around it, you know. Typical typical white trash southern. Seen dirt road across the street from a cotton. field with the boot with stuff growing all over it, and house and. yeah. So you know I would love for him to get out of that area because there's nothing to do. But at the same time i'm just like well where would you even go, you know."
759.0,Provider,Chief and go.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah that that's not going to cost, you know my sister, and I have to like pay his rent or something like that, like we don't we don't really want that, and I feel like maybe it keeps them out of trouble being there you know. yeah, although I feel like that got him into trouble because he didn't have anything to do and nobody's around as if he's online, you know getting himself into trouble. I don't know I don't know what to do."
759.0,Provider,"Well, sounds like you tried to do your best in terms of contacting him keep in touch with fam making sure that he's Okay, you know, the best way that we can you know, despite the you know situation or circumstances that mad at him in jail or you know, like. What my you know, like happen, you know but, like you, sounds like you're doing the best that you can as a starter, you know, like it's a difficult situation, our parent. who's been accused of something like that or who has done or who did it, you know, like you went to jail for it, so we can say that he did that. You know, oh, you know he probably doesn't deny it so yeah."
15913.0,Patient,yeah well yeah his claim is he you know it's a fantasy world they create online and he always checks people's ideas to make sure they're of age or like whatever but i'm like well that doesn't negate the fact that you had child porn on your computer and that's illegal so.
759.0,Provider,So we go.
15913.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"i'm not taking my chances with my own kids and I don't want that energy around. So yeah I kind of wish my sister would be a little bit more. involved at times, she will she like I you know I spent two weeks getting his house in order and getting a license taking care of it renewed so you can drive themselves places and fixing the House up and. You know that was before kids. or kids and stuff. But, but I would go back and spend time with him there when I could and. She just she won't go she's like it's not something that's fun for me to do i'm not going to do it, you know. So you will not, you will not go visit him. there and I don't you know there's no real place for. him to come visit her she's never invited into I guess so. You know, at some point I guess. It is nice she's on that coast, because if you know he's older he has some medical issues and stuff and I feel bad when he does have to deal with something he's kind of on his own to figure out like transportation and all that."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15913.0,Patient,"he's not really in a place where you can like call an uber. But the you know stuff there is definitely more limited but uh and he had a falling out with his cousin who lives next door, unfortunately, so the one person that could like help him out."
759.0,Provider,yeah he has a falling out with.
15913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so I don't know what's happening there, but I know they're not on speaking. terms, he can come. But. need help or you're doing a good job that looks good. You didn't want to wear then i'm not sleepy ones, are they too hot. Okay. Okay, that was good yours your dad on the phone right now I hear him out there.
