207.0,Provider,We all with your kid.
3763.0,Patient,"seven year old my daughter, they have it all crazy here they had my daughter. it's cooking. my daughter. Had virtual learning the first week show see but she just a magical day and now, maybe have the elementary school during a week of virtual learning, but he started at a different time so he's still in it. I don't get it. Just it's probably the I guess the staffing like maybe they were just I don't know I don't know why I don't know why this didn't do everybody, the same time, why would they take the extra precautions elementary knowing that it was happening to another school right down the street. You know any mean same school district, where I wouldn't you know with a weight or people got sick and the elementary school was, like all corona. I think that's their procedure they were trying to approach was to wait and see the numbers and people start getting sick, because I, my daughter's already gotten a letter saying, she was exposed to someone who had coven. She had to seeing home and quarantine and then, then the virtual learning that started for week because I guess it probably spread and people are people not it besides, you know the I think it was the teacher or something. Two of my daughters friends habit, so I don't even know."
207.0,Provider,"Well, I know I know in there in Ohio it's really bad."
3763.0,Patient,"I think so, and here we were thinking you know Florida, because I think Torah was the first one to you know, keep tabs I got family down there and they were letting go of. You know masks before we were in stuff like there are certain you know policies that we were all doing for the State I, my understanding is for did it before us and you know he's kind of like given me more freedom and slack so the people in Florida. So that people thought too early and stuff and we thought the numbers would get worse down there. But i'm just battle over. I don't know if I scan my daughters of the Pfizer i've seen or not. hmm. 12 she's just turned 12 in May. Is on like that cost, you know. I don't."
207.0,Provider,care.
3763.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I will um. yeah she just got seeing she had to get shot. Oh, they did say the way has she has had to get her seventh grade shots. Now that I remember, because we did kind of talk to him about it but Martin big on are you know, working on something that we really wanted to do just talked about at the time."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, you and your husband weren't necessarily be done, the idea of preventing shot."
3763.0,Patient,"Well, no, I was that the hair was out to her physician's office, because she had to go there and get her seventh grade shots. And it was just because she is getting a couple of shots time should you get three of them and then. You know they're like hold off, you know if you want, you know we could ever after the shots you know shoes it's getting those cocoa, and I just asked about it. yeah so. You have three more questions they have to get done like now."
207.0,Provider,So so you're. you're nervous. about sending her back to school.
3763.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah go back today it's I mean I I just following along earlier, so I don't know you know. My. husband's mom just got to the hospital last night, so the big thing is, is that. she's in intensive care of the count out she had coven. room."
207.0,Provider,Okay.
3763.0,Patient,yeah so we were freaking out yesterday and we couldn't go and see her at the time we went to going because they will finally moved her out of the er and put her in a room but she's not respond to.
207.0,Provider,All she's not. An older mom.
3763.0,Patient,"she's 63 I think some around she's wrong my mom's age, which I know my mom is 63."
207.0,Provider,She had she had all underlining condition.
3763.0,Patient,"she's not the healthiest bird yeah. And I guess she just was hiring dream home and breathing and her boyfriend left or on the couch and my understanding for two days here she was sick when feeling well when he probably should have called the ambulance. So sat there for two days on set that's that's right now i'm. going to occur when you're ready and we didn't know we actually mean me and my husband, we did go over there, a couple days ago, like probably there's probably her first day maybe anyways he said we're all sick we don't really want you to come in. But we didn't think anything of it."
207.0,Provider,"Let me, let me explain to you so remember our group yesterday. and My husband is on in the hospital because I told him."
3763.0,Patient,"Oh, my God."
207.0,Provider,"But he's responsive responsive now just like what you said. Is. cove it is different for everyone, like you said she came in, to help the bird but he is. For the most part, pretty healthy. You know if he sees on healthy, we would have cozy would have told us hey the reason why is because you do this and we would all found that same time. Right it's it's just one of those things where. you're absolutely right, you you think like you said hey i'm just sick, I have the flu it's not that bad i'm okay."
3763.0,Patient,Because we were all sick in the House now we all start thinking we gave it to her. yeah we didn't call kind of thing. You.
207.0,Provider,"can choose your so come. On by the whole were in shock right now. It is shocking it, you know lauren, this is a this is okay so. it's therapeutic as this can be this is what you see, I live on a prayer that's what I that's what I have right."
3763.0,Patient,We prayed yes we prayed last night really hard because we're scared we're scared to.
207.0,Provider,"In this is the thing anxiety and fear and everything is not going to help me and. Why it's not one to help well. My fear in my anxiety and my worries can't tell me. It will. Only put more stress on it. Right and that's The one thing that they tell you why people while they're there they can't you know. They need to keep their anxiety down, they need to keep their struck down exactly the big thing it needs to stay down because once it stays down, then the body is not fighting all these other things. Right, because what happens with the code is my understanding it's not just you're fighting a fire in your body, then start the fight all these other things that it sends off and so um you know you have to be mindful of all of it but she's not responsive to she does he have pneumonia."
3763.0,Patient,I don't know I guess you per breeding was that bad I mean damper on life support.
207.0,Provider,It what did they tell. It means that.
3763.0,Patient,"I don't know. we're scared to see how bad is is, so to speak, and we're just kind of Ukraine she's gonna wake up, they said, the only reason why they have her kind of incubated is because can breed for herself."
207.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah yeah.
3763.0,Patient,"All the way home again not not not not 100% scam read, but not enough."
207.0,Provider,"So if I had waited one more day he could have probably been the same way. wow if we had waited one more day. right because it took off his lungs that much it took off it was over half as long so. lauren nobody can predict tomorrow, this is. How, nobody can protect tomorrow you don't even know if you're going to be alive tomorrow. But I know that, but this is the thing all you can you and your husband, if you do believe in God, all you got to hold on. No i'm not going to tell you that if you believe in God and she's going to wake up tomorrow. or downgrade or she you understand i'm saying, but it doesn't take away. Your belief out of him."
3763.0,Patient,"i've been trying to keep my view, Sir, you know my beliefs and check as far as like you can trying on to you why are you doing this it's not bad it's like just throwing curveballs and God comes in. You know in and helps sometimes the last minute, or you know something happens and that's what I was trying to."
207.0,Provider,And for you and for him it same focus on that. lauren is it listen i'm telling it to you because I know exactly where you all.
3763.0,Patient,"Right now, I know you are."
207.0,Provider,"And I know that you wake up you wake up and you want to call the hospital to find out is everything okay. Right literally what she what is she okay does she wake up, am I going to get bad mood. And so you live on okay I didn't get a call from the hospital I didn't get a call from Moscow. Right so let's go with that being good."
3763.0,Patient,Good exactly.
207.0,Provider,That that let's go with.
3763.0,Patient,It and call it good.
207.0,Provider,"For now, and yes. And, of course, if the phone call comes in, because you call them you're calling you back you forget that they're calling you back. and conduct. Your heart drop. yeah do you think, but no i'm just calling you back you remember you called me, and so it is legitimate."
3763.0,Patient,"But I thought about it yesterday, because when it first happened. And I remember when I was in group last night last maritime before and you just remind me of the whole way square your emotion comes, but it goes out, you know what i'm talking about. And then, like they were talking it came in, really, really, really hard, I had to pull over. And then I just after a little while it went you went down."
207.0,Provider,You know what i'm saying is just a damn I gotta remember that helps explain it to me. And it goes out and but it's.
3763.0,Patient,it's way.
207.0,Provider,"worth it. Listen lauren a word word list and let's live in reality for a second, I have to live in reality, because remember you know, yes, this is your mother in law. For me it's my children father. Right, I signed. In so."

207.0,Provider,"i'm sorry Susan I say you hold on to God, the fall I did yeah. Yes, and so lauren. Will you when the waves come in it's kind of like that big wave that come with me say that Florida way, did you know that Florida, we may really be. There for the wave that comes in, and you know when the Florida wave goes out it's slowly oh."
3763.0,Patient,"Right fan, and I think a lot so when you said that and justin and you've been important, just like a stuck with me and it's like i'm I think I can run with that you know just just to help me to remind me. This too shall pass and i'm. proud of you girls it's not her in it don't. freak out."
207.0,Provider,"don't freak out and go help me so somebody says. Like Michelle how are you going through this well honey on the floor and no man I can't help myself to help my children and then go help him so yeah i'm gonna have to figure this out and that's ultimately what I used to keep me going. The truth of the matter is, could you get an inevitably. You can also get an edible call that she was driving. You can all get a call. You know. it's just one of those things where you know where you say when a person says a positive, it is just stay positive as much as you can. we're not having a positive, because you know, some people use the word stay positive out of context or."
3763.0,Patient,Just yeah or like we're getting error or whatever yeah just.
207.0,Provider,"Stay positive lauren and that's ultimately just stay positive, it is you know when you said that she's not the healthiest bird like what does she have, what are the underlying thing."
3763.0,Patient,"She. Also, has substance abuse traveling just definitely lived a very, very hard road and now, and she rolled she's paying for it simple as that."
207.0,Provider,"This is what I will I will. I will encourage you, because. Both i'm going through it. Can I call you back from a personal standpoint, the lesson to be learned through it. yeah it is I literally just having a conversation with him and he sounded better every day he sounds better and i'm like Oh, this is great money and he said. I know. I could tell you, the one thing that i've learned from this, he said. You know, truly, we weren't really taking care of ourselves, our immune system was not integrated so honey, we have to take vitamins, we have to take a lot of vitamin D, because he was like you know. Every day, they give me vitamins, they give me certain vitamins and she's like one vitamin they give him twice a day. vitamin C, they give him twice a day, and the other vitamins, they give him so he said, you know we have to say loaded up on these vitamins because it's a lot about our immune system and."
3763.0,Patient,By being able to find it out.
207.0,Provider,and to be able to fight it out and one of the things that we didn't.
3763.0,Patient,"share it say in your group yesterday, but I said it in my group today and it's because somebody made mention I said, this is why it's."
207.0,Provider,"so important that we have to go and get our checkup, we have to go to the doctor. yeah, this is the only way, because you remember, every year, when you go to the doctor they do blood work and they tell you. What your levels are and they tell you what's going on. Right you don't go, you will never know, and so I would say. In your husband. You."
3763.0,Patient,"Know sure and i've been. i've been kind of like you know i've known that back my own like yeah you know I really got to start being more conscious I keep that in mind map, I really need actually probably exercise it. You don't even like exercise. so to speak. And I know now, and I think this is outside of you know, listen, this is, this is really the test of."
207.0,Provider,"Your face it, when you say you believe in God really how much do you really believe in God."
3763.0,Patient,At this right.
207.0,Provider,"You understand. It could be a host of that it also could be. Right, you know what both of you needing to sit down and saying hey let's worry about let's not get caught up in the narrative of. Oh, my God at school, but it's scary especially get caught up in the narrative because if you get caught up in that you missed the whole point of view, what you're supposed to learn in it. For both you and him and him. You are right, currently the main breadwinner if this was you. If it was him what would you do you guys have how many kids under the age of 16."
3763.0,Patient,whole thing.
207.0,Provider,"is, are you hear me say this all the time, what can you even though it's somebody might say, what are you going to ask me that, in the midst of it all in the midst of things is when we learn."
3763.0,Patient,"Yes, you're right now you're right, I agree with you hundred percent. You know."
207.0,Provider,I can tell them.
3763.0,Patient,You know.
207.0,Provider,"It goes back to you remember that group, where we talked about idle and intentional destruction of the LIFE circumstances. it's oftentimes it brings us back to the middle and saying we focus on all these other things, but when life becomes so super fragile. Anybody worried about all the things that she was worried about before. i'm not worried about it i'm not worried about doing."
3763.0,Patient,Any of that right now.
207.0,Provider,"I need you to come home to me that's all I need I do. That is all, is on my mind I think about anything else about more than you coming home. And so, in them when you're in the trenches it's time for you to learn it's teaching you something."
3763.0,Patient,"And then i'm In essence, it helps you get through that, though."
207.0,Provider,Right doing and I.
3763.0,Patient,"Forget rory rory good girl, I agree."
207.0,Provider,"I can't tell you that lauren is that your your mother in law. is going to come out of it and i'm not going to tell you that she's not gonna I can't I can we can all stay hopeful and prayerful that she. She comes out of it. But there's two there's two things that can happen here, but in the end, it is still as listen to ways ain't gonna stop because you tell it to stop it's the emotional, therefore, the emotions are going to come in, but when they come in class."
3763.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,"What allow it to go. And for both of you, if you feel like your husband is having his moment. There, and just embracing and don't say."
3763.0,Patient,"yeah. Like I said it just yeah well The thing is, is that he has he been around you know he hadn't has mom and his life what 10 1112 years and then moved up here, you know, he was raised by his mom and only you know and went through all of her issues together in Europe, you know. But he came out of its strong and mood for you know got better and had his own business down there was doing well on, then I met him blah blah blah. And now we're up here and we've been with her for two years and we see your own time, you know now she can't babysit no kids just you know that's not the point she's still. You know, had an impact at least on me and has you know, an emotional bond, you know what I mean just connect with you. Your views to have that person around us to be able to take over there, you know she's helped us a couple times a little bit with me know when you know if I when I was in between jobs, you know."
207.0,Provider,"Listen. I have, I have a thought to have a father and a suggestion. I didn't keep her too long, you know cuz ya legal say over share she just to spiritual for me, but this is what i'm saying to you, this is a thought in a recommendation, you and your husband. When you pray. get real with God, just like how what you just said. yeah he's been through God i've been through a lot with this lady i've been to her ups and downs, for her addictions and her struggles and I was gone for 10 years. Well, God, I am so thankful for the two years you allowed her to be that that I spent with her regardless of whatever your decisions I am so grateful for these last two years."
3763.0,Patient,yeah right yeah.
207.0,Provider,"i'm so grateful for these last two years and Lord if it is you're going to take away from me helped me through it all. yeah helped me through it all, because I can't. I can't."
3763.0,Patient,"read that story so many just experiences in life that I. I truly believe that God will not let me go through anything that I can't handle so much you know what I mean. To that point like she always seems to. Yes, I go through difficult things but it always it's likely saves me and the engineers, you know and everything."
207.0,Provider,"He always does, but you know oftentimes we play we play."
3763.0,Patient,I know what's.
207.0,Provider,going on.
3763.0,Patient,"No. No, I get it god's gonna Take, for she wants when he wants."
207.0,Provider,"When he wants. But that. you're not necessarily going on your needs with that clear what you in both of you, because it's his mom and as much as you try to be supportive but it's been very real, just like how you said you just said. He listen she's had her bouts of whatever it is that it was going through with her own addiction and i'm sure that tore him apart and that could have possibly been the reason why he left for so long, but you know what he got two years back."
3763.0,Patient,"yeah and good years but she's you know she's better she's very ill, but you know Elvis you know she's got liver damage. I don't know now she's very frail like she's constantly a little bumps and bruises very easily like just. Had so."
207.0,Provider,"Much going on, she has a lot going on. And, but regardless of what it is. it's just. God I wouldn't mind having another year with her, I wouldn't mind my grandpa hurt my children being around with for another year, and you know and it's just putting it out there be bearable. Both of you. may be by yourself, when the kids are cheap or whatever, be that vulnerable when you pray be vulnerable pour it out and that's just kind of because you know what lauren sometimes I will help you get through it."
3763.0,Patient,"um yeah I agree, I lost my dad you're in a car accident, I was 16 years whoo man that's that's overstating but I got I you know I got through it i'm okay today and they know I can talk about him saying. I know this is just a man. I really appreciate the insight on it, because it reminds me of things that I need to keep that focus that on it, otherwise I don't I can't tear apart, yes. Okay."
207.0,Provider,"You will both of you go on a journey each and every day at some point in the day that's going to take you down the road of negativity all of your I promise you, it will I promise you, it will, but you know what do like you said with. The way somebody come back come back, because if you stay there, you will only think the word."
3763.0,Patient,here.
207.0,Provider,"You will only think the word, if you will. So."
3763.0,Patient,"i'm like the point where it's hard to think about like he. Still kind of settling in this like. i've had friends you guys, you know for substance abuse and drugs and soco do life support. For weeks and graduate mom polls login. There on like that."
207.0,Provider,But it doesn't have to.
3763.0,Patient,"Do it a champion, which is just in life understand."
207.0,Provider,"It doesn't have to be her narrative. It doesn't have to be her narrative all you can do is right now. just continue keeping hope alive and just praying for her being strong, for your your your husband."
3763.0,Patient,"Now the whole virtual learning, and all this stuff going on, I just had to have an hour conversation with my son special ED teacher because. He had ADHD struggles, they have a plan in place for him for virtual learning and stuff like I have them in better school some from last year and I have an IP and there's just like so much at stake with. It as far as learning and Sasha."
207.0,Provider,"People on it's like as you're going through all of this, then oh hey guess what what's the."
3763.0,Patient,answer to this guy.

3763.0,Patient,I started. On again when I go out I just.
207.0,Provider,wanted.
3763.0,Patient,"I think, with it, but I think about it often and i'm like well honey, let me tell you."

3763.0,Patient,"And more shocked yes i'm definitely more suck you know that you know that i'm like oh my God, this is. freaking a real. For real now."
207.0,Provider,"I was just like you now well my math get with everybody. So I just don't really leave the House it's don't leave. Once you experiencing it for yourself no you're not going it's not doesn't necessarily save you, but at least it's a mental there's a mental part of it, like okay well let's just put a mask on. it's one of those things that you're a little bit more intentional. yeah I want to and the other thing that I just thought about lauren is maybe if I don't know if you guys watch TV a lot, but maybe limit on how much you watch right now."
3763.0,Patient,"yeah i'd say I stay away from the news all together i'm a core know I should have a lawyer, I really am in love with Court TV, so I want to watch TV all day long."

Look at other people's problems and and pray that on that on not behind. For murder. Exactly you're."
207.0,Provider,"Asking yourself it and it is good, it is distracting yourself. What helps me right now, it is the destruction of it, I find that I have a lot of support more than I thought I did oh that's. Being myself with it and talking and doing all kinds of other stuff it does distract me from sitting in this lonely place, and all I do is sit here and think about it all. Right those."
3763.0,Patient,horrible horrible. Exactly yes.
207.0,Provider,So I would say just be encouraged lauren completely totally be encouraged and. A hope. For the best and just really just stay in a place. Of. And just you know prayer.
