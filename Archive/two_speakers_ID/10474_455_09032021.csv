10474.0,Patient,"See i'm not really much and i've had those. Oh, you know the the I guess blood tests, they can do where it tells what what medications will work for you or might work for you. There are very few that are on that list. And I honestly don't remember what they are, I was taking. Just recently, I was taking Prozac ran out a couple couple weeks ago about I had only been taking it for a month, so i'm really not sure if it was working at all. Then I usually have something for anxiety, but I don't have anything right now."
455.0,Provider,he's prescribing the Prozac.
10474.0,Patient,It was a. counselor I was laying to. yeah so I need to reach back out to them and see if I can have her give me refills on my anxiety medication and see if she thinks I should move forward with with that or try something different.

10474.0,Patient,Oh well.
455.0,Provider,As long as you wear your mask correctly.
10474.0,Patient,Right right because wearing a mask doesn't protect you it protects the person.
