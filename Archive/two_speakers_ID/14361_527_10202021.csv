Maybe we'll just end it early hopefully that can happen."
527.0,Provider,sure what what kind of things have you been learning with those classes.
14361.0,Patient,"Well, honestly. The more of the anger thing, but like I said i'm. Like same thing with here like there's people that are in that class there are like going through way more crazier stuff and I am it's not even like the same. thing. and I don't know if I told you, but the whole thing happened like during the whole seizure thing and like a little alcohol was a while, but really I don't remember anything from that main and ever since then I haven't done anything like that. And I never been in abusive person, so it was like. Really sucked. yeah so. And then just being in jail for it even suck more because it was like I only spent four days in there, but it's still like. Sure, I wasn't I wasn't being given my medicine, so I was scared of having seizure in jail."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14361.0,Patient,"Food was horrible you know jail food. You can get like a good night's sleep because everybody's so like loud at night. yeah super cold. Steel bed, so I was like really not it wouldn't even be worth it, if I was ever to be in a situation like that, like why. sure why throw your life away or something like that."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah how how is your girlfriend doing with all of this, because I know that's I mean that's part of the reason, all this is initiated, how is she doing with. With the work that you're doing and me, and you manage and all the legal stuff that you're going through."
14361.0,Patient,I mean she's been great she's like my little guardian angel honestly she's always there and. I honestly wouldn't know where i'd be without her.

14361.0,Patient,"i'm. not sure not that she's mentioned, but the thing that we just try to stay focused on this just never drinking that amount over again. And then and I haven't been drinking actually for a while now. But um if, like we ever go to a party and like there's family telling us to drink never ever. Get talked into drinking more than what we should. Okay, and then i'm just taking care of my seizures because I don't know if I have also told you, every time i've had a seizure I fight with the paramedics because I guess I get scared you're saying like no like they're saying I get scared and I want to like run away from something but. Account what it is, I don't remember anything. mm hmm but."
527.0,Provider,"sucks yeah yeah it's gonna say, have you. talked with your like neurologists to see you know, is there something particular and your chemistry or with your Caesars like to have a better understanding of how those you know play out, and you know everybody's is so different so you know."
14361.0,Patient,yeah mine is tricky because there was from a brain trauma from a. run. A skateboard injury. it's not like I was born with a or it's not like your runs in the family or. yeah it's not like we know anything that triggers it's just something that happened. To me.
527.0,Provider,"Sure, does it do they ever like explain like where it exactly like impacted within your brain like."
14361.0,Patient,yeah it was in the in the back of my head.
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah like and what many areas that kind of impacts, as far as you know, does that deadly and it said, like really like. impulse control or you know things like that or memory complicated area actually they say that they don't know."
14361.0,Patient,"Exactly what that part of the brain does so. I honestly got pretty lucky because i've seen people with that get the same same exact injury on a skateboard they'll hit their head the same way. And they'll die. The doctors were like surprised when I got up to walk. Okay, and I was like wow thanks. yeah so like even when I have a seizure, I always remind myself like dude just thank God i'm alive."

527.0,Provider,Okay yeah yeah.
14361.0,Patient,Just like the bike or the bus if I need to.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah and I think part of it is just understanding, you know what can I do to to help minimize my symptoms and take care of myself like is there a particular things that that the neurologist is you know, encourage you to to do to maybe minimize the you know frequency of them or. You know, preventing them."
14361.0,Patient,I know the video.
527.0,Provider,was a piece of it but.
14361.0,Patient,"he's told me a lot of things, but like the main thing that I noticed is the drinking. that's why I had stopped I stopped drinking. I think it's been like. Almost four or five months that's why the seizure that I just had. These like super weird."
527.0,Provider,sure.
14361.0,Patient,It was super weirdos just.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
14361.0,Patient,"I don't know if it was maybe because of sleep or. I wasn't stressed. Maybe just sleep, just as I don't know. Maybe it would meet right. Really don't know."

14361.0,Patient,Besides sweet no.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14361.0,Patient,"And it's like I never I never had a problem with the weed. So it's. It was a really, really weird to her yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Is that something that does your neurologist know that you're using marijuana or. Yes, okay. I didn't know if it was medically prescribed by. By him or."
14361.0,Patient,"He doesn't really agree with it, but. I okay i'm like yes, I am."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, is your probation officer Okay, with it, or. I don't know that word oh you're not on probation. No okay trying to avoid probation. yeah okay."
14361.0,Patient,"Go no no i'm not good i'm not trying to avoid probation either i'm just doing all this, so I could get. My coat my record clear. Okay yeah okay."
527.0,Provider,"So do you so your is your lawyer, just like a public defender that you're working with. yeah okay okay gotcha. Okay, so you don't have any charges at this point then hey Suze right."
14361.0,Patient,"As far as I know of I don't think so. Everyone one night. Big big on my background check I worked with just said, pending the rest."
527.0,Provider,So this was just part of was this part of your being able to be released from jail that you signed up for classes and therapy and.
14361.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I had bailed out. Okay, so I was fighting that whole case and, like. Like I said, my girlfriend didn't want to. Press any charges that was really the COPs and everything and I guess um my lawyer had told me that she had ran into one of the officers that was on life leave because he got injured."
527.0,Provider,And a hair salon or something like that.
