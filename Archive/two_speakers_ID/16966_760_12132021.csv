760.0,Provider,You okay so guilt. guilt. yeah is it. Is there another word for it or is that the only word that you say.
16966.0,Patient,it's pretty much all guilt.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe guilt. is one of the triggers. All right, um So what are so when you start to get like that what are some of the coping strategies that you do to try to take your mind off of the thoughts and feelings."
16966.0,Patient,"Well, I used to watch movies and TV shows or that's how I describe myself that's not helping me really anymore, sometimes I listen to an audio book that helps occasionally. Okay, but I don't really have it anymore."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, no none other. Okay okay and and who are the people in your life that you can turn to right now to support you, when you start to feel."
16966.0,Patient,"like this. Well, I live with my boyfriend early. But. I me and my family don't really speak too much, I used to be one of jehovah's witnesses, but I recently left that religion, when I moved out in April."
760.0,Provider,Was that why you moved out in April. Because of maybe disagreement over the religion or.
16966.0,Patient,"ways that mission to like it's not religion you don't date before marriage and I just felt trapped and I feel guilty, because I have i've stolen from my family in the past as well, like it was a lot of things together."
760.0,Provider,So what do you mean you were stolen from your family no i've stolen like you have oh.
16966.0,Patient,"yeah So in addition to that, and leaving the religion, I know that really hurts, and then I also have a boyfriend as well, they don't believe in Premarital sex and all that so. All of that was making me feel like I couldn't live there, like they didn't kick me out or anything like that, but I was getting so depressed that I could stay there, like so I left."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so am I hearing you correctly, that you don't really have anybody that you can talk to them right now yeah you can't talk to your boyfriend or."
16966.0,Patient,"I know. This, too, but I don't want to. overload him, you know he's got a therapist he's not. I don't want to carry that burden, you know, so I took it he knows the things that i've told you know and like we talked about it, but I need."
760.0,Provider,Okay okay um.
16966.0,Patient,"So well communicating as well and I can't. It I know it's me because, if we have an argument or I feel guilty I can't even speak it's difficult I don't know why and it's always been like that, for me."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right and who do you have any other than we're just now barely getting to know one another, right now, so. You know, we can work towards more work towards that and can be support for you as well, but is there anybody that you. had prior to this. Like a professional person or a crisis Center that you know about, or anything like that, if these thoughts. become so overwhelming."
16966.0,Patient,I have friends. And they know like I get depressed but other than that I don't talk to them about.
760.0,Provider,"Okay don't. know I can't really count them. I do want to let you know, there is a. Crisis line number available it's similar. To the 99911 number for emergency but it's. it's more mental health. space for these kinds of thoughts and feelings somebody to support you if if you're not. quite sure who else to call and maybe it's like three in the morning, or something like that. And that number would be simply 988. Is that something you think you can you could remember. And then, of course. we're going to be that as well. So what are the safe environments, that you have where. Would you go to. feel safer an environment. A place."
16966.0,Patient,Since moved out and I. work part time and so does my boyfriend so we can't afford it apartment. So i've been living in a hotel but.

760.0,Provider,"Okay, so is that something that you want to address to reduce."
16966.0,Patient,"Sure, I. I don't think that it's something that I can't stop or anything like that I don't do it very often I just. um but, just in case it is I haven't I want to address."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so how long have you smoked."

760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay um. Next i'd like to ask. about your life growing up. let's talk let's start with did you have any childhood abuse either inside your home or outside your home could be emotional abuse verbal abuse could be neglect. Physical, sexual. insider out of."
16966.0,Patient,"Sexual or physical abuse whatsoever. No, not really verbal abuse either. My parents are African so. They. are very blessed with their. Statement though it's not like they were trying to be abusive or anything like that, but I got my feelings hurt a lot."
760.0,Provider,growing up.
16966.0,Patient,"yeah like I was overweight, so they would tell me like I need to overweight, I need to reduce the weight like that's not going to fit you. And, or like if I I got good grades during school, but if I got to be they would my mom would be fine, but my dad would be like Oh, who got a's how many people got is why didn't you get an eighth like that, but other than that nothing."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how was how was your relationship with your siblings growing up."
16966.0,Patient,"And they were a lot older than me so my oldest sister is 17 years older than me and. They were also. My my three older sisters they're the oldest and they were born and raised in data, so I didn't meet them until I was seven. And then, it was me and my brothers. And there's my oldest brother's 10 years older than me and my other brothers five years older than me so. They like and my both my parents worked full time so like they took care of me. pick me up from school. Until I was old."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so you said that you're you moved out on your own because you felt guilt, it can you talk to me about your I don't know if you grew up with Jehovah witness. Or if that was something that I was bored. Okay, so pretty much grew up with that and. What. started to change and how old, are you now Melissa."
16966.0,Patient,i'm 30.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and so what started to change that you didn't want to be part of the religion anymore."
16966.0,Patient,"So nothing changed, I always felt that way. Since I was a child, little I remember that but. growing up that way, like my three oldest sister's they're not one of witnesses is just my parents and me and my brothers my oldest sister she was in it for like a year when they first started going."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16966.0,Patient,let's she decided she didn't want to and then she got married. And when I I was i'm the last born.
760.0,Provider,and
16966.0,Patient,"Also, the younger, so I felt like. Pressure like. A. Pressure to. Just follow after my brothers, you know, like no one's left, I think, going. And like. You keep it. In the congregation that you grow up with people like people have received me since I was maybe you want I didn't want to disappoint anyone. So. growing up, I would continue to add that was supposed to pretend like I was. Part of the creation and then I would do things on the side that I wasn't supposed to do."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so how long."
16966.0,Patient,Is it.
760.0,Provider,"Oh, because the Jehovah witness don't doesn't. celebrate a holiday."
16966.0,Patient,Days don't watch scary movies there's a bunch of things.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and so what age, do you think you were pretending that you were going along with Jehovah witness, do you know at what point you decided this isn't for me, but then you continue to go along with it because of the pressure from your family and from the congregation."
16966.0,Patient,"Well, I remember doing it like at five but, at the time I didn't really understand. You know I just knew what I wasn't supposed to do and what was supposed to be doing so I would pretend, but I think I was. I want to say I was about 11 maybe when. I when I was old enough to understand like that religion in its entirety. Of the link and then. And I just kind of just kept going."
760.0,Provider,Okay at 11 you really didn't have much of a choice you were so minor.
16966.0,Patient,"Like at 13 like in, and then I got baptized that 18. Then I knew, but I was still. Reliance on my family and and I didn't want to disappoint the people in the congregation because I know they loved me and. I just have a lot of trouble. Telling the truth to people. who care about me like I end up telling people what they want to hear a lot, so I had applying a lot. And i'm still used to doing that I do it so often know even when it's not necessarily like I can't help it anymore."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so we'll have you told your family now. moving out of you said I told me."
16966.0,Patient,I told them before my built out.
760.0,Provider,"And, did you what kind of reaction, did you get did you get pressure to combat. What how did that unfold."
16966.0,Patient,"I got pressured to come back the not just to the religion just come back to God, in general, they said you don't have to be one of jehovah's witnesses, but you can't like live with your boyfriend you can't you should stop lying because they know they lie and the stealing and. And i've tried to make changes with those things and unsuccessfully, but. it's mainly like they wanted me to come back to God and I don't even. i've never been able to build a relationship. I know I do believe in God, but i'm not but my whole family even my sisters who aren't witnesses, they are Christian. So they just want me back to God."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so is that something. You could take a deep breath and just kind of asked me answer cuz i'm gonna ask you a question. And I want you to take a minute and think about it is this something that's important to you to come back to God in some way or Is this something that you think is pressure coming from others, family and others."
16966.0,Patient,"I would like to come back to God I just. Be because there's several things that I agree with I just can't. make myself do that or how do I explain it or. Are some things like I agree with and some things I don't agree with that all you know. Like religion as a whole, but for. God, I have trouble. I want to be the person who cares about times that I did I have trouble reminding myself to. even think about."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you feel so you feel isolated in your life and that it kind of extends. To that idea of God or higher power yeah."
16966.0,Patient,"Okay, no, there is a God, but. I grew up with so many rules and the way things should be. I felt like I never took that in as i'm as my own, or like it my father or whatever, can I don't even know if i'm capable of that."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16966.0,Patient,I think I should be doing.
760.0,Provider,"I would like to make a suggestion in that department. There is so many different ideas of what is God or what is higher power, I mean there's I mean even within the Christian religion there's a lot of different ideas. One path if it's important to you because I did read through some of your important your paperwork and you did express it was important to you and then hearing this from you. Right now, I would like you to perhaps start considering the difference between what is religion, which is. You know, a group of individuals, a group of human beings who organize a belief system that worships God or some higher power. versus the spiritual which is spiritual is more of an individual of my own personal relationship with a higher power of God and so perhaps. This is not something that's going to be a quick fix for you, but since you're expressing that that's important to you, and you know, perhaps if you start reframing it differently, Melissa and start thinking in terms of. Not so much rules, but you know different start exposing yourself to two. Different maybe you didn't religions or different types of church and just you know studies of authentic spiritual programs, that would be one thing that I could suggest that you could start working on. I don't know. It you know if that makes sense to you. Any kind of. You know, because my own version of a higher power of God it's not so much about rules it's more about like basic commandments if you just kind of read the most basic things and focus on that one thing. Okay, so I don't want to stay on that too long, but I wanted to suggest that, because you know. You know, churches, they have their own rules, they have their own perception and. You know I think it's important that we find our own part of that what is our own purpose our own way of thinking and believing and and through that we can find a relationship okay. So, you mentioned that you stole from your parents can can you talk to me about that what was going on, or your family is it your parents go from."
16966.0,Patient,Just my mom.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and. And who what was going on, that that that that was something you decided to do."
16966.0,Patient,"The thing is, I don't even know why I did it i've been like trying to rack my brain like i've been feeling like my almost my whole life, I want to say little things like candy bars, you know and then later on, it went to money it's like. I. I remember a time where is the time that I couldn't stop like whenever I go somewhere to take something was sharing and then that when that goes away for a time and then it comes back. Okay, and I don't know if it's just selfishness, or something that I can't stop or because i'm not even. Really when i'm doing it or thinking about the consequences i'm just literally doing it watch it."
760.0,Provider,it's mind let's say you walk into a supermarket or you walk into any kind of I think oh I should.
16966.0,Patient,"Take this or like if I needed to face, I think you know, sometimes like we even have the money to buy it, you know and sometimes I did it."
760.0,Provider,Okay. um. Do you have any kind of legal.
16966.0,Patient,"Four years ago I got a misdemeanor for theft. At a store and then, I have a pending case coming up from for my work, I got fired in September, because I stole from work."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Alright, so. Perhaps you have a lot of. Things that just kind of unconscious things so you make these decisions, and you just do things and you're not thinking which is kind of what you started out talking about this."
16966.0,Patient,"trying to figure out Why are people ask me why did I don't know how much. For that, but I feel stupid like I should know."
760.0,Provider,Okay. All right. So you you employed right now.
16966.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm a kipper i'm attempt right now."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and what do you do."
16966.0,Patient,I worked at tomatoes for the sampling.
760.0,Provider,"Oh, you did the sampling."
16966.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"All right, and how long Have you had that job."
16966.0,Patient,Just three months since I got fired.
760.0,Provider,"All right, um how much of an education have you finished. Partial college like how many years are semesters."
16966.0,Patient,"So I went to after high school, I went to college and I went got into the nursing program and. I got all the way up until the last two semesters to graduate but then I for the program you cannot get the program I was in you couldn't get a more than to see pluses during the entire three years day. And I got three so I got kicked out of the Program. and during that time I had lied and said that I was still in school. And I had a year later, I had said that I graduated, even though I did it and then years later, a couple of two years later, my family found out, and so I went back to school. and start over so I didn't my general ED but then the pin democrat and then. And then I got in trouble at work and for the nursing program you don't have a. criminal record yeah so I dropped, so I haven't done."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you see there's still a part of you, that would like to be in Earth."
16966.0,Patient,"I think I find it very interesting, but I don't think. i'm afraid. That. i'm going to do the wrong thing like i'm gonna lie about something or i'm gonna steal from or do something, so I don't. I don't want that. Because that's a reoccurring pattern of mine. And I don't I don't know how to stop it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, let me i'm gonna look down here, forgive me, I want to make sure that no kidding all the questions. That i'm supposed to hit. As you hit on most of them, but. talk to me about your level of stress right now."
16966.0,Patient,"it's very high i'm in debt, I only work part time I don't have a place to live and I can't. And I can't apply i've looked for apartments but they want like three times it's a rent and I can't qualify for it, and neither can put blame for it and."
760.0,Provider,"That is that because of. Low credits for that's causing the ideal they want you to make three times your gross income Okay, because of your income OK. OK and talk to me about your self esteem."
16966.0,Patient,"It was high, but I feel like that was imaginary before, but now it's not high I feel bad about myself all the time, like. I feel like i'm a bad person because i've done bad things, even though I haven't done. I haven't killed anybody, you know I just. feel like I don't deserve. To be happy, I don't deserve to be living because i've heard all the people who cared about me. And I feel like i'm going to continue to do that."
760.0,Provider,"You do you think it's fair Melissa that to consider that maybe. The experience of not not that you're. The that your family wanted to intentionally say or do things that hurt you, but do you think it's fair to say that as as with the child's mind when you were a child that you kind of experienced that as like verbal put Downs or i'm not good enough or. My beliefs or my are not important or valuable, so I have to pretend to be this person that I don't really feel do you think that that had some kind of a negative reaction on you."
16966.0,Patient,"I think so, but I also think that it wasn't just with my family anytime anybody had. Like a negative thing to say, I tried to fix it or. or change it to or lie about it, so that they would be okay or happier except me."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. So you think underneath it all that. You are not okay. Okay, and at what age Do you remember what's the earliest, you can remember feeling that way."
16966.0,Patient,"Maybe. feeling that way, all the time, I want to say, maybe like. 13."
760.0,Provider,"says you're 30 now. yeah so that's. that's like seven years that's a long period of time. Okay. All right. want to give you a little bit of feedback if if that would be okay. yeah Okay, so a lot of times when we're children we make decisions and we go along with things because we don't really understand the world we kind of take the information, where it is we were born, you know what religion, we went to or or didn't go to so for some people. All of that kind of like plays in, and when I go through my childhood not feeling feeling ashamed or feeling less than or. Somehow. not good enough that sets like a negative system of belief, about myself. and which. creates like what i'll call like habits of thinking or thought habits like constant thoughts about myself i'm not good enough constantly going through my head, which is going to impact my emotions and so. That those negative thoughts that are continually going through your brain driving the negative emotions. create a pattern of how we choose to behave. And it seems like you were so busy wanting to please everybody that you weren't true to yourself, so perhaps these these habits of lying and stealing. developed as a way for you to cope with the way that made you feel that you weren't sure authentic self. What do you think about that."
16966.0,Patient,"I think that too i've thought about that, before too, but I felt like I was just trying to justify what I was doing."
760.0,Provider,"well. it's not a justification, but at some point, there has to be an understanding. And at some point then change comes about, by looking at that and working through the emotions of what what you were thinking thinking and feeling back then. which perhaps is so kind of with you, Melissa which is maybe it's been building all these years, you know, seven years, being a long time to be carrying all of that."
16966.0,Patient,Dirty sorry I don't know if he was.
760.0,Provider,"Oh, even more yeah. yeah my math is."
16966.0,Patient,The greatest.
760.0,Provider,"So it's the it's worse than seven years that it's more than seven years yeah so. So. So part of treatment is to kind of look at that and and start. Replacing those negative thoughts and it's hard to do because they're their habits and once we develop habits habits means, this is something I think just without trying. So there's things that you can do to start working towards that. Does that sound like something you want to work on. And that's that would be called something called cognitive behavioral therapy, which is kind of a fancy way of saying my thinking affects my emotions, which affects my behavior and so starting at the root of that looking at that and processing your feelings. And then, perhaps, one thing I would like to consider, have you consider would be using affirmations lot more positive affirmations to start to change that I don't know if you've ever tried those kinds of things in the past."
16966.0,Patient,"it's hard for me to keep them because of the behavior that I exhibit. You know, like i'll tell myself one thing, but it's all you did this so it's not true, you know."
760.0,Provider,"So you're judging yourself based on this habit of behavior and so there's a part of you that's feeling like the behavior is just so the behavior sounds like it's automatic like it's habit as well. Okay. Okay. All right, um. I still believe the affirmations can be useful. But we'll get there, maybe, maybe not quite here. So I want to make sure, Melissa that you're that you're safe, because you said that you don't really you don't want to do that to your family. but can you um do you have any kind of a plan of what you would do to hurt yourself if you if you really want it, if your mind was really going there."
16966.0,Patient,"No i've attempted in the past with bills, but it never worked I like. I like woke up in the morning. i'm not a person that handles pain well, so I don't really have a place."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so you're not handling pain well. Okay um."
16966.0,Patient,"Like I can't see myself of the ways that people commit suicide like I can't see myself cutting my wrist is I couldn't bring myself to cut myself, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, i'm. All right. Does your family want to and they attempted. To reach out to you or."
16966.0,Patient,They just kind of give you.
760.0,Provider,More faith.
16966.0,Patient,"know that my sister is giving my space, so my brother is one of my sisters she calls in Texas, from time to time, but my mom. She messages me a lot. And I have because of my trouble with communication, then the guilt, I feel. I have, I don't reply all the time to them. me they want me to come home they want me to. I haven't even told them that I got fired from my job that I have a different de la they want me to. leave my boyfriend they want me to come home they want me to come back to God and I know that I do that they'll be. they'll be okay, but I don't think I would be. That that's why I left."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, are you are you with this boyfriend because you want to be with his boyfriend or is this. Just somebody. To be with me, can you talk to me about the nature of your relationship with them is it is it strong. Is it. So so."
16966.0,Patient,"it's strong it was stronger but it's not shown me more because when we started there we've been together for a year now, I had lied to him I wasn't I didn't tell him I was a witness and then. Later on, it all kind of came out I didn't tell him I was feeling like these things come out, you know. Like when I got. fired from my job he he came, you know. So, and I became like reliant on it for a little for like a two weeks until I got another job you know."
760.0,Provider,He.
16966.0,Patient,"He knows that I have this trustful pattern it's like he knows I lie a lot so, then I have trouble communicating you know. So that was a hardship on our relationship, but he knows that I need help and he he's supportive. and"
760.0,Provider,"He knows you're you're coming. To pride ourselves. And he is supportive of this okay good. Okay, have you have you ever considered that perhaps the pattern of stealing and maybe even lying. I think sometimes patterns of behavior can become addictive. And I don't know if you. You know addictions are patterns that develop because of an inability to cope, like my emotions my things that are just so overwhelming I just truly don't know how to cope with this thing I can't cope with this depression, I can't cope with the skills and these other emotions and so. But perhaps the stealing gifs does it give you any kind of a is there any kind of like a. Or what. Was there in the power, yes."
16966.0,Patient,"When I was younger yes. But that's kind of went away, maybe like five or six years ago. When I after after that, like when they instill the things like i'd be happy, I had this stuff but it wasn't like, for it was just."
760.0,Provider,"OK. OK, I think it gets kind of confusing to understand, but just because of the nature. of addiction. What happens. Then people yeah and I think it can happen, the feeling, you get the rush and. rush is what you call a dopamine. rush, which is a chemical surging through the brain it's like the hormone that motivates us that. keeps us happy, but the more we steal or engage in these kinds of behaviors we have these artificial rushes. Of dope the mean, and so the body starts to regulate that and turns that down. But the addiction is like a spiral, and it just kind of keeps going. same thing could work if somebody has a drug addiction, or an addiction to gambling, which is not about taking a chemical into your body but Have you considered that perhaps stealing is more of an addiction, for you at this point. i'm defensive about it like that way of saying it like that I never thought about it, but I knew that."
16966.0,Patient,"Like sometimes I talked to myself, and I say like shouldn't do this, why are you doing this like like I knew I had a problem, like this. But I didn't think of it as an addiction, you know."
760.0,Provider,That.
16966.0,Patient,What do you think of that what is that it would be.
760.0,Provider,"yeah it does make sense Okay, yes. Yes. So maybe working on that part from the addiction addictive side of it. might help. I don't know. Do you do, can you go into a store to get basic necessities like food and. Oh yeah without feeling on anything, besides, like the work."
16966.0,Patient,Experience I haven't sold anything from a store it. Since I think we're in June.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, several months. yeah okay so that's okay Okay, but that, but the lying is still kind of. Something okay. Okay. All right, Melissa do you. i'm sorry this has been kind of a difficult session for you. As far as the things that we're going to start working on. Have you have you started group yet."
16966.0,Patient,"No, I start tomorrow."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good all right so start. start your group sessions. Maybe, would you like to work on the. Starting maybe with the guilt and start doing some CBC around the guilt."
16966.0,Patient,yeah I think the guilt of lying in the communication or like my top things that I work with.
760.0,Provider,"Okay i'm may want to next time we meet we're going to need to. talk a little bit more and kind of collaborate together for to. for you to come with a plan that was. A treatment plan. For a treatment plan always. belongs to you because. it's your treatment it's your life but it's a collaborative process, so you know we we work on that together. So, but i'm thinking just off the top of my head just based on this short time that we've talked so far, working on guilt self esteem affirmations maybe some might talk to you about mindfulness a little bit."
16966.0,Patient,yeah I think that would help me too.
760.0,Provider,"So those those are the thing so mindfulness and cvt just like making. All right, do you have any questions for me."
16966.0,Patient,"No um when I talked to I forgot her name for the lesson, she said to chief I had moderate depression. Is that what you think I have, or it could be something else or."
760.0,Provider,"Yes. I also see in your diagnosis anxiety. So anxiousness mindfulness is really good for anxiety and depression, really. I just think that. You know, mental health has a tendency to spiral, and when we develop thought patterns in childhood. That are toxic to ourselves it kind of drives a negative emotion and a negative belief about ourselves, and it just kind of the more we think it, the more it builds and it just keeps going and going and going and it's been many years that you've been struggling this. And you're still seem to struggle with speaking this is what I believe. And this is Hawaii I am yeah. I had."
16966.0,Patient,That problem. Even I didn't even realize that I had a problem until the last couple years it was just automatic.
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah so so maybe what you were doing back then was taking these very. Painful feelings and guilt and just kind of shoving it down coping with it by lying. And then it, but the feelings, they just keep growing and growing and growing and over time. you'll either explode, you know. In the wrong way at the wrong time, or sometimes we implode or a combination. We could could like implode, and this is how things like Depression and anxiety. That makes sense. yeah so it's a process of starting to question that. I want to make sure, do you how do you feel at the end of the coming to the end of this session, Melissa do you are you in a safe place and feel better or worse. And you talked about."
16966.0,Patient,"Like i've talked about it and. i'm not just like I have done a plan, but I have something to try to work towards that i'm not just going to like let go or forget about are."
760.0,Provider,So you want to work on yourself and feel yourself and make and make your life better. yeah.
16966.0,Patient,"Okay, just feel like I needed the help to cuz trying to do it on my own I stopped working."
760.0,Provider,"yeah but you've tried to do it on your own Melissa without even being able to truthfully talk to anybody. You there. i'm sorry you froze oh yeah i'm sorry I lost you for a minute. This is what I was saying is you've tried to fix it on your own without the without the true support or the ability to be authentically yourself with anybody. And a lot of times that I kind of want to distinguish between thinking and emotions. Thinking can be rational. We can kind of think things through, and like make conscious choices this. Is the best choice. But emotions can be very irrational. And when we repress them for such a long period of time they just become so overwhelming that. We can't it's like in my face, and now I can't see. Anything but my irrational emotion."
16966.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Does that sound right. So.
16966.0,Patient,"I feel like I don't have. A personality like I have what's left of my personality, but not a real one. Because i've been pretending for so long, or like for so long."
760.0,Provider,"Perhaps there's another way of looking at that Melissa. Maybe there's a personality that didn't feel safe coming out because it didn't fit. This idea of. What you were raised what. Your expectation of what your family and the church wanted you to be. And so you covered her over it, and. Maybe. Another way to think about it, Melissa is that she's still in there. it's just a matter of pulling away all the negativity and the debris to find her. What do you think about that."
16966.0,Patient,Okay right that's true.
760.0,Provider,"We all have a personality it's it's in there. it's in there. And, and we. We can talk about those things. Okay. i'm going to will do what your treatment plan next time but i'm going to try to find some self esteem building things, maybe some. You know. yeah I have some self esteem self esteem building stuff that we can. kind of start working on i'll have that written ready next time. Do you know how to schedule appointments with us. Yes, okay."
16966.0,Patient,"Can you read is my person that I usually. Yes, yes."
760.0,Provider,"If you if you can reach out to the care navigator or to the you can go also to the virtual clinic and just schedule the next appointment, you can feel free to schedule it we usually meet every two weeks. You do your groups every week. So if you can schedule out your next appointment and then maybe even the following that might be a good thing to do."
16966.0,Patient,"I think it's January 10 I. She. But it's with a medical provider, so I."
760.0,Provider,"don't okay. Good to every two weeks with with. would be with me so if it's for a medical provider that's that's a separate appointment that you'll need to keep them it's important to you know, sometimes it's. The combination of meeting with the medical doctors and. Getting on the prescriptions having the symptoms get. turned down a little bit, at the same time, we do the work on thoughts and emotions and behaviors okay. That sounds good. yeah Okay, well, it was very nice meeting you, I appreciate your honesty and your openness to share all that difficult. difficulty with me, Melissa. I look forward to, I look forward to working with you, and next time."
16966.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, just make sure to schedule the next appointment okay. Okay, all right, I will."
