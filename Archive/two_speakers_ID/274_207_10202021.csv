207.0,Provider,"What when you when did he tell you that he wasn't going to be there, the following week."
274.0,Patient,"He. wasn't there. that's why I didn't know if they still have me on like the first Monday, are they going by when my refills to do because they're a week apart."
207.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, they can have it."
274.0,Patient,does it say when the next one i'm supposed to go through as.
207.0,Provider,"Well, when is your next."
274.0,Patient,"It would be the eighth one my refills do, but I guess at all they're going by the first Monday."
207.0,Provider,Week. Or you can. On till. Eight I guess. yeah the second one is a.
274.0,Patient,Crime.
207.0,Provider,No.
274.0,Patient,Yes.
207.0,Provider,you're trying to argue cash pay.
274.0,Patient,i'm. Only paying on an old balance everything I have like right now going forward. is covered.
207.0,Provider,Oh.
274.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Your monthly right across. And, based on the survey that you complete in. What you said. i'm looking at your surveys. minimal. For your anxiety and depression. So how are you how are you. Coping with lightman because, according to a survey you mentioned well so tell me the secret."
274.0,Patient,"gonna lie I don't know if it has to do with like you know what the body was used to but. suboxone has helped my addiction it's helped my knee pain and it's helped my anxiety now I don't know if I wasn't on it, if I have more anxiety at this point, but, besides the suboxone I just. If something's bugging me when it comes to a family member, I just remove myself or like what i'm my child's dad he was having problems last week, he was trying to involve me I just shut off my phone. And I just I don't know I just think about it, like it's all going to pass over anyway so don't even. worry about it. And my mom she always reminds me to there's the same um. I don't know if it's fat Father beale I don't know if he's like that's his name in English, but. cell is reminding me worry is useless because that's what he says."
207.0,Provider,"Well, what would you say what increased because I never put it like this, because a lot of people who say you know outside of being on the suboxone they talk about. They talk a lot about you know they use to help with the anxiety they do a lot of they stay off okay make and I, and I just checked your your drugs, and I see the only thing that's positive on here is the. will be in the you know so."
274.0,Patient,"yeah I don't smoke weed. I stopped smoking cigarettes, but I went to the vapor pen. I mean i'll smoke once in a very great wow but that actually makes me more nervous."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then so and i'm not, of course, by no means that might encourage more famous suggesting because I always say you know a lot of people who have the they say the medical marijuana and I asked what's the real medical condition."
274.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So anxiety, we have to also identify what causes our is creating our anxiety and so, even though, like you just identified. You find that the suboxone it also does help with the your knee pain in your anxiety, but let's just address the anxiety because, for the knee pain that's something that you just have to check out, you know it could go with. With age it could go with your health if it's like I have knee pain, they say lose a little weight and your pain will go away that's what they tell me. yeah but it's. More importantly. What increases your if it's generalized worry. or your anxiety."
274.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i've had it since I was like 15 or 16 I mean just certain things like knowing I had to drive home after school or work would trigger it like something that simple. i'm. Knowing that I have like things to do, or places to go that. kind of upset."
207.0,Provider,"Normal activity. Those are normal things little activities, I mean you say that you've had anxiety, since you were 15 or 16 truth be told. we've all had some form of anxiety from a young age, and some of it it's learned right, not all of it, some of it is. yeah hey. I say I remember my grandmother used to say she had a daycare you know, like when a baby falls off the bench. And what do we do immediately. What our reaction to the child falling off the bed like."
274.0,Patient,running into it.
207.0,Provider,"And, and then, when you do, that what the child."
274.0,Patient,cries more.
207.0,Provider,Why.
274.0,Patient,Because they see you're upset. molly said just. Just let it be let her.
207.0,Provider,"And then went, because if the child fall you do the reaction differently, the child Father you don't pay that what what happened, you don't pay no attention, what happened."
274.0,Patient,They just figure it out.
207.0,Provider,"One more. minute, because now the only legitimate times you're like. The react because hey i'm actually react that way, but when you don't react."
274.0,Patient,its way out.
207.0,Provider,"There, like the bounce up in your and I learned this from my grandmother and I always held on to that so you think about something are our top. Because the child, then feeds off of your reaction. Like the other hand, my son. He was saying he said something hurt. He said something hurts. And hit like I don't know if it was his he was his elbow he said her now on Saturday squeezing elbow you know i'm studying a freezing elbow he is not reacting to the second level. And I think it was something that he didn't want to do, and I remember what it was, and I said to him, I thought you said, your elbow hurt it hurt you supposed to react and the minute I said that, what do you think he did. Oh."
274.0,Patient,"I know that my daughter did the same thing, like it was just the other day, too, she up you know she's like falling back on the bed, but she was a little too close to the law, and I know it like she had just hit it very slightly like it wasn't a hard bump or anything but. um you know she's just looking like a little startled and the second, I said, like, I had to catch myself, because I didn't like I didn't see that she was crying or anything like I had to turn around. And, before I could like habit register she um I was like Oh, are you Okay, and then that's when she starts crying i'm like oh my."
207.0,Provider,"God, I took us. Because he's nervous, she would have kept moving."
274.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"There are two, there are times, where they're coming in they're acting all way and you're like i'm like you're fine goal. And they're. Like well why aren't you react because it's not wrong with you keep it keep it moving. and moving, so you think about. Our worry or anxiety and everything out. Of 10 times that becomes a learned behavior, and so we get shocked and we get sorry not i'm not saying that sometimes it's not natural. The natural, yes, but then, if you start to behave a certain way, so generalize natural thing. Is I worry. I don't have enough money to pay the bill. that's a natural worry, but if we bring it back the question is if you're only generating $2,000 a month, are you living over your $2,000 income month. So if you are, are you going to be worried that you can't pay all your bills."
274.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"If you live with it, if you only live in within a five to 1500 dollar budget, and you have 500 left for yourself, which were no."
274.0,Patient,No.
207.0,Provider,"No you're not worried cuz you can pay all your bills are you good. Right so it's identifying like you said Okay, the suboxone helps with my anxiety, but the truth of the matter is Should I be continuing to treat my syncing or, should I identify what's causing it. I am. Driving late at night, I personally don't like driving late at night and part of the reason why I don't like driving late at night is because I feel like everybody decides to go drink and go party and they have no. They don't think about anybody else on the road and so now the empty road becomes a racetrack. So yeah i'm i'm on the road late at night i'm thinking that oh my God i'm going to get hit in something bad's gonna happen in worth if the light is green, because if you ever drive late at night, the traffic lights for the most part stays green little bit longer right. yeah like we're about to do you through it and every time my husband is about to zoom through it my heart rate goes up and I saw that slow down slow down let's look each way before you cross over that."
274.0,Patient,interface yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Because, just like how you're doing it, I feel, somebody else is doing it, and so my info I really hate driving late at night, where would that word come from where would my thoughts come from as it's related to that."
274.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,Information i've collected over time things that i've seen on TV over time and so naturally when I hear which I haven't read it. My pulse rate goes up my heart rate goes up I get ridiculously nervous and anxious and I can't wait to get home because the whole time i'm driving home. Something bad's gonna happen something bad's gonna happen something bad is because of the things that I feed my mind with so it makes me anxious. me worried and then help one day I was driving home late at night and somebody drove by so fast that the car shock.
274.0,Patient,And all bad.
207.0,Provider,But what do you think that does to my anxiety.
274.0,Patient,Oh yeah right that's.
207.0,Provider,identifying what creates my anxiety what is causing it and once I learned to manage those things that's calling it then I will need less and less and less of the things I take.
274.0,Patient,"Mine words like. just any old activity throughout the day like that, what do I do about it, like it's almost like I feel like I can't help it."
207.0,Provider,"I feel like I can't help it. The question is, what does your day look like and how much, are you putting on your plate during the day that making."
274.0,Patient,"thing it's not a whole lot sometimes it's just going to work but. That feeling comes when I drive home and it's not like i'm worried like about accidents or anything it's just knowing I have something to do. Like my home is my safe haven, I really don't have anxiety when i'm home it's just when i'm out like. I don't know."
207.0,Provider,When your home is your daughter there.
274.0,Patient,yeah for the most part.
207.0,Provider,"When you're home, let me ask you this, when she's not there she's with dad or anybody else. In your home. You have any guiding."
274.0,Patient,"Well, when she's with your dad yes, when she when my mom no, but this has been the arm. And I can't even think of the word, or the pattern this hidden like a pattern since before she was even born."
207.0,Provider,"But you have to identify what increases your anxiety is this fear that you're not going to make it home is it fear of something bad happening, you have to think about when I have anxiety, what did I just think about that increasing what just came across my mind that I increase. Because you're right, it could be, just like all of a sudden i'm feeling this, but then couldn't has been that it was just a passing thought that increased it."
274.0,Patient,All right.
207.0,Provider,Do you think positively all day long.
274.0,Patient,"I mean, I tried to there's some instances where don't."
207.0,Provider,"You think about those instances. That you don't naturally we're not thinking about positive things all day long you thinking about all the worst thing and what you're about to do and what you don't do what this person is thinking or what they didn't think what's. going to happen, and when you when you think when you take a check into your thoughts. Some of those thoughts. can trigger. Your anxiety and then you start worrying and you're worrying about what what are you worried about. kind of like I always say to my kids you have everything in life, what are you worried about what are you stressed about hey nothing that you should be worried about or stressed about. Sometimes it's just that passion thought."
274.0,Patient,yeah after try and dig into it more when the next time it happens.
207.0,Provider,"it's not so much i'm not telling you to put yourself on this very grueling task of figuring out your anxiety, but at the end of the. My my question to you. When it comes on to you find that the suboxone not just helps with cutting your cravings and your urges or whatever you also find that it helps with my I have knee pain, did you get an a bad accident."
274.0,Patient,I know it's hereditary.
207.0,Provider,um it's hereditary part of monsters hereditary to but also I got Paul not very skinny people in my family.
274.0,Patient,Oh yeah I put on extra weight to that that didn't help me but.
207.0,Provider,But from a hereditary standpoint is that the same thing with a lot of people in your family anything.
274.0,Patient,Was the weight.
207.0,Provider,mm hmm no.
274.0,Patient,I mean no because the side of the family that I get it from is that was actually. Never like really even overweight.
207.0,Provider,Have you ever gone the doctor.
274.0,Patient,"To find that um I have actually gone lately a few times, the only thing I have kind of procrastinated because it's like I have to leave messages and it seems like they don't call back and then, when they do I miss it and I don't call it. I already have the referral for physical therapy. or surgery, because now it's bones urs. On top of the pain i've had since I was young, now I have bones first. So I don't know I still have to go there and see what they say if it's surgery or if physical therapy will help."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm and so it's definitely something to look into and the reason why companies because I remember one coin and getting physical therapy. And they had given me this page now, of course, all new things are different, some people it's the art right issue the boundary calcified they're all kind of different reasons. yeah something that has given me to put on my knee because they said it was somewhat out of place, so there was like listen to it was like this tape that they had given. And the way they taped it, I never felt any pain after that."
274.0,Patient,Oh wow.
207.0,Provider,"it's a tape that they put you put on your name and and I just know I never mind I compare that to do all kind of stuff and I click on it and I never felt the pain and I think it was something that held my knee in place the point ever had the pain. yeah but it's identifying if you can find. How can I address the issues without. i'm. Taking something to do with the symptoms. So, then the question would have to become what is your end goal."
274.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, obviously, it would be to be drug free and pain free anxieties brief, but I know in."
207.0,Provider,"The anxiety, however, you will."
274.0,Patient,drive but.
207.0,Provider,"will never be anxiety free. Right, but we can be we can learn how to better. deal with it as it comes, or we cope with it on deck fluids."
274.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,you're a mom you're in you will never be invited to that.
274.0,Patient,"yeah that's just like today, I got a. notice from the teacher saying somebody had your hand and foot my mouth disease or whatever it's called and they were on the playground, so now, you need to watch your kids for symptoms i'm like oh. yeah."
207.0,Provider,Exactly exactly it's just learning how to not overwhelm yourself.
274.0,Patient,With right.
207.0,Provider,"mason can you stop yourself from doing it, you could try your best. You could just say hey you know how, how can I, prevent and how can I stop or or what have you. And that's all you can do."
274.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,it's just ultimately learning how to manage it all. How is the. Your your kid status so.
274.0,Patient,"Oh it's not funny but sometimes it is but i'm. Right now. Because he because you know, I was living with his friend and then him and friend him and his friend were both high or drunk off something they got into it. I don't know who called the police on who, but his friend ends up kicking them out so for the last three days he's been just. happening from a friend to friend like hanging out with them drinking and, once he finally got to his family's house and, of course. his whole family they don't want to do anything but they want to call me and I told him I was like listen i'm done carrying the weight you guys deal with it i'm sorry but you guys are gonna have to deal with it i'm not doing it anymore. and He ends up getting right to the hospital or something and I guess, he was completely irate and you know, a disorderly and all that so. And they probably seen that he's gone to the hospital so much for the drinking and the hangovers and the problems he gets when he's hung over that they are actually moving him to a psychiatric like Ward or I don't know what it's called. i'm like oh my God."
207.0,Provider,he's in a facility right now.
274.0,Patient,I think he's still in the hospital but they're going to move him to a facility.
207.0,Provider,"um. So sometimes you know you have to allow me to go through it in order, in order for a person to change sometimes you have to kind of take a step back and allow them to go through what they need to go through the lunch. Now he. kind of has to make some change and right. I have another appointment to jump onto. Your Wednesday or your days off right."
274.0,Patient,Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
