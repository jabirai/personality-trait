13568.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. I mean the whole group therapy has been great so far I initially like in the beginning, I was like I mean do I have to you know, do the group therapy I just rather do like a one on one thing you know. But, but I mean it so far it's felt like comfortable you know the few sessions i've attended. I feel, like other people can relate, and you know, sometimes when you just hear them out you feel like you know what i'm going through that as well, like. And then, like if they share something that you know helps them out or whatever like it's always good to like learn things from them or or you know or shared things for myself like so that maybe I can help someone out so. So, so far, like I liked it so far. huh yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Look at you, you were looking for anyone to come."
13568.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,how's your uncle.
13568.0,Patient,"He he's better I mean, I guess, they will start the key most he wants to give it a try, I mean the doctor said that it might not help, but you know and that maybe like it'll just bring his whole like system down quicker. But was it give it a try, and so my cousin she talked to me, and she was like yeah you know, like he wants to try, like everything possible, and he wants to fight this so we're just going to support whatever his position is."
740.0,Provider,"The lowly. I mean the fact that he made it out of the six month mark. yeah and then getting better instead of getting worse. Which is a, which is a miracle. So. that's a good thing, I hope that everything works out and he recovered 100%."
13568.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
740.0,Provider,So. Tell me how you've been big how you've been able to manage anxiety. let's See you in September.
13568.0,Patient,"um well, I think the medications have play like a big part because, like when they started seeing you guys. Everything was like fresh like. You know, out of box or whatever, but like the medications kicked in and then like my sleep and everything was back to normal. just that and then like I tried to like not overthink things when i'm kind of feeling, you know that Russia i'm going to get the anxiety, you know or i'm going to start feeling weird so I try not to overthink it and just kind of like work on my breathing and. And just try to clear my mind as much as possible. mm hmm because I know like it. Like versus like when I didn't really know like this bullying, or you know the symptoms, or whatever like. It would freak me out like Why do I feel this way like that's not right, and you know or, but I have a feeling that okay it's anxiety so it'll go away like it, for, so I I just keep reminding myself like it'll go away, you know, like it's just a little light wave coming but it'll go away. yeah. For now yeah."
740.0,Provider,um. What are your plans moving forward in regards to handling it.
13568.0,Patient,and I guess continue doing what i'm doing.
740.0,Provider,I mean i'm.
13568.0,Patient,"gonna keep taking my medication and just like keep everything in mind, you know how to deal with it, and I mean no specific plan. huh yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Oh wow of asking. It because i'm a lot of anxiety you never know what's gonna come. Right or what's going to trigger it. But the same way you keep an umbrella, and you try and just gave the reins because you never know when it's going to rain. Right in the same way, you can prepare yourself and make sure your toolbox with stocked up, just in case something, just in case the anxious attack every hit. You are saying. So that's why I was asking about so you're playing one of the things I will encourage you to do. Is have one. is something that you can work on moving forward. i'm, just in case and i'll say that I was gonna say they because I see you know, things can be going good and the phones and and the flowers bloom and. I know ain't going nowhere. Right, the I mean the best for the waking up is folgers and yoga okay you've got gotcha style for APP from some saw books and you ready, however. You know how many times we think you know we do that because we haven't had anything. But you know there's always a need for maintenance. yeah exam there's always me from a missile a check a check up every now and you know. i'm if I use the example I think, and I group when I say a bit if you bring. A plumber to your half the fixture think. they're not going to be under the sink, and then I tried out of top just to make sure that everything is working correctly and so that's one of the things. That, I want to encourage you to do in regards to, of course, having a plan because maintenance is always makes it better. You want to make sure, everything is working correctly. You want to make sure that the tools are therapists have taught you that you're actually able to implement for the long haul. Not just with temporary of fate, so that you can have it so that it's taken care of things right now, and like I say you're out all the time, made a same down 60. It helps them manage it. But you gotta do the work. So that's why I was saying that every boss so playing. um. So, other than that. yeah so i'm going to check on the Roi. Just to see I just reached out to your. Your assigned. navigator just to see if your therapist has given us. And then, of course, if they had and then need obviously you probably every few months of chicken and if they have it. I mean see twice a month."
13568.0,Patient,"Okay. Minimum I think we have another booking together next Friday. I know yeah. So. So yeah I mean I might just like stay with you guys so i'm not like going back and forth, and since I don't really see her that often then yeah I mean if I have to do, like the whole compliance things thing with you guys I rather keep you guys."
740.0,Provider,For you.
13568.0,Patient,I like.
740.0,Provider,well. um let me see. yeah what did they what did they put you back to back like it.

13568.0,Patient,OK.
740.0,Provider,"So the 20 2031 because I mean since everything is going fairly well according according to what's your report, there is no point of me saying this, we need this Friday next Friday, because that you will be staring at me like i'm all good here, I remember going on. At least give us the reprieve. But, mind you now. Again, you know all you have to the only thing you're required to do is to me twice a month, it does not have to be every other week, it can be one time at the beginning and one time at the end. Okay, and so they will never complete mad the frequency always depends on you always leave it in the hands of. The client, because you know what you need more than I know what you mean Okay, so if at any time, we need to change the frequency and you see me more often that's fine, but for now if you're going to speak, what is, if you go dump the other one just kidding you want to stick with. The edges, we can just do twice a month one time and again. Okay, one time at the end, and so that way, it will never complete with your work schedule and get in the way of the other things that you got going on."
13568.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah cuz you're on the required to see me twice it doesn't have to be it's not like a set schedule. Well yeah that's another holidays for me to be the phones, I will let me just go ahead and feel of the 23rd before Christmas before new years. And they get a knock and then an eye catcher to soak and put you back and compliance."
13568.0,Patient,yeah okay sounds good.
740.0,Provider,"Alright, so this is what I need you to do now, because we got like five minutes of metal, how would you, but I wanted to know do is there anything you want to feel work on why you're here with me, is there some new set goals you want to accomplish."
13568.0,Patient,I mean.
740.0,Provider,like that.
13568.0,Patient,"I think the last time that we spoke, we talked about like family boundaries and stuff."

Man, so I have been like thinking about it and I pulled myself from doing stuff that I would say yes to you know, so I mean i'm still working on it, even though sometimes I feel a bit crappy you know my parents my."
740.0,Provider,"brother oh. yeah no I see the thing about it is don't even let yourself go there. yeah at the end of the day, the only person that you can help the most is your sales you're only as good as you are to other people, as you want to yourself, and if yourself is exhausted tired over the age are they kind of, say, stop me become resentful you got when you are you angry. Because people will take take take but ain't nobody poor poor poor in and nobody gave him back and so. Is this in regards to you know you know you don't have to it just limitation, you know you have to be able to have a minute, and it has to be like a cut off. And when okay Well, this is my lamia i'm not going over this limit and so that's basically what the boundaries that's basically what. I saw Is this a little bit, and then you say you tell yourself i'm not going past this lindy."

You know and and, like the whole chemo stuff so like she was like she came to me because she knew that I had gone through that with my father so she was kind of like hoping that I had some sort of like input on how to like go about helping her dad."
