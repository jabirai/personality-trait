706.0,Provider,Okay okay. Any plans.
14464.0,Patient,"No, not really."
706.0,Provider,Okay um. How often would you say in the last three months you've had suicidal ideations.
14464.0,Patient,"guess probably every day, or at least almost every day, probably every day."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, but no plans of how you would do it."
14464.0,Patient,No okay.
706.0,Provider,"So what does that look like, for you when you say you have suicidal ideations what does that look like, for you to me tell me what that's like."
14464.0,Patient,"Sometimes I could be going along and something will upset me, even if it's just a thought or a train of thoughts and then i'll start thinking that I wanted to. kill myself and mentioning the bunch of different ways I could do it that I know that i'm not going to actually go through list but. i'll end up saying it to myself in my mind, and maybe quietly to myself, over and over again for a while, until it just sort of fades away for a while, until the next time."
706.0,Provider,"So, would you say that you have them at least once a day, if not more than once a day."
14464.0,Patient,here.
706.0,Provider,"um when those are happening, what do you usually do to cope with them."
14464.0,Patient,"hmm. hey. I. Usually just. keep going on thinking and whisperings stuff for a while, until it just fades away for a while."
706.0,Provider,"When you say whispering stuff do you mean you whisper stuff to yourself, or you have voices saying things to you."
14464.0,Patient,I whisper it to myself. Like out loud but quietly so no one can hear me okay.
706.0,Provider,and basically to talk yourself out of it.
14464.0,Patient,"not exactly just sort of. Just sort of whispering my thoughts out loud okay release this is, to a certain some of them are released."
706.0,Provider,um So do you wish that you were dad or do you wish that you could go to sleep and not wake up.
14464.0,Patient,Sometimes okay.
706.0,Provider,But you've definitely had thoughts of actually killing yourself.
14464.0,Patient,"i'm not entirely sure how serious they are really. Because like i've never actually tried to do anything because, like I know it would hurt my family and I don't want to hurt my family. Okay, so that's been like. So let's begin."
706.0,Provider,"um but you don't have like a specific plan or any intent to act. Okay, when you say that you think about ways that you can kill yourself what what things go through your head."
14464.0,Patient,Maybe. jumping out the window or sticking a bag over my head. or. um. I think that's usually the most common because it seems. I don't know.
706.0,Provider,Okay. um but you haven't ever had the intention of actually carrying through those are just thoughts.
14464.0,Patient,"hey yeah I. Think, so I think if I didn't have any family I might, but since I do have family I. I don't think it's i'm going to do anything about it."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so your family as a protective factor for you. Okay okay um Have you ever had any suicidal attempts. No, have you ever done anything or started to do anything to prepare to end your life like collect pills or giveaway valuables or write a suicide know anything like that."
14464.0,Patient,No okay.
706.0,Provider,"um. Has there been anything recent in your life that, as you know, caused you trauma loss anything like that that you think might be activating those feelings."
14464.0,Patient,"um. I know. A couple years ago my mom was had to stay at a mental hospital for a few months because her mental health had been gradually getting worse and worse over the. last few years, and then it reached its peak were to be kind of traumatic. She seems to be doing better now. And then i've had various pets die over the years. i've had sort of social issues for on my life. i'm not sure if that. Has any effect and sometimes sometimes i've read some read and watch some stuff on the Internet that upset me probably more than it really should have."
706.0,Provider,So. When you talk about these suicidal ideations when you have these thoughts. you're saying that they're pretty much daily um How long do they last.
14464.0,Patient,minute. kind of varies I haven't really been timing it necessarily it's i'm too busy working through it to keep track of it.
706.0,Provider,"No absolutely so I guess the maybe explaining it better, is a kind of a fleeting thought that you're like Oh well, this just really is terrible and I just want to die, so I could just jump out a window, or is it something that last longer like but maybe less than an hour. Or is it something that lasts like more than an hour."
14464.0,Patient,I know. I know. i'm gonna know usually sticks around for a while i'm not i'm not sure how often it goes over an hour.
706.0,Provider,Okay okay. Would you say it's closer to an hour or closer to like one to four hours.
14464.0,Patient,Probably closer to an hour.
706.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, no it's I know it's really hard to try and determine how long you're in that state, because when you're in that state like you said you're just trying to get through it so."
14464.0,Patient,"Honestly easier, not to fight the thoughts, because otherwise I just start feeling more distressed in general, if I try to fight it off."
706.0,Provider,So you don't really attempt to control your thoughts.
14464.0,Patient,Your cuz when I do it just makes me feel even more upset.
706.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14464.0,Patient,just give me worse physical symptoms or not you're already have.
706.0,Provider,"And so i'm determines that i've stopped you from actually developing a plan and going through it, that would definitely be your family. Is there anything else."
14464.0,Patient,"hmm. Well, I don't like making a mess we're leaving a mess and pretty much anything I could think that would leave a mess for someone else to clean up. probably be my family, which would further their true."
706.0,Provider,"OK OK, so the trauma of your family is the big one."
14464.0,Patient,yeah and then just not liking blood and messes and stuff and being kind of a verse to pain.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so also another determine is. The thought of the pain of dying."
14464.0,Patient,Because I don't really know anything that would be truly painless that I would actually have access to.
706.0,Provider,um. Do you when you think about the reasons that you would want to die or to kill yourself. What I mean what what is that reason.
14464.0,Patient,I guess mostly to stop the pain of whatever i'm thinking about.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and give an example of some of the things that you think about when you have those thoughts."
14464.0,Patient,"What might be a flashback to something up half upsetting that happened, it could even be what at any point in my life, whether it's a few weeks ago, or years or decades."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
14464.0,Patient,"Even be something relatively minor like something I just read or watched on the Internet or something or it could be something that happened with another person some misunderstanding, where I gotten a lot of trouble."
706.0,Provider,i'm.
14464.0,Patient,"I know that i'm overreacting to that stuff, but I think you really."
706.0,Provider,And you've never had an attempt.
14464.0,Patient,huh okay okay.
706.0,Provider,"All right, so the reason I asked all those questions, just so that you know. Is that we. Do an assessment for suicide risk. You may say. At this time you're probably at a moderate risk suicide risk I do want to tell you that we do, there is a national suicide hotline."
14464.0,Patient,"So then, if we."
706.0,Provider,"ever do feel like you want to harm yourself, or you feel like you just need somebody to talk to you about it, if you can't. talk to your family, and you can always get a hold of bright hurt to I don't know if anybody told you that, but if you're really struggling, you can contact the virtual clinic and they can get Ahold of one of the therapists and see who would be available to see what you're really struggling."
14464.0,Patient,And I I have called a hotline before after some incident on Facebook.
706.0,Provider,By 980.
14464.0,Patient,"I don't remember which number, it was, I think it was something I think it was the nami number and am I."
706.0,Provider,"Oh okay. So. that's a really great one to call to. their actual national suicide hotline all you have to do in your phone is dial 988. And that will take you to that suicide hotline. Okay. Okay, so, so I just want to kind of recap really fast, as far as what you told me, you said, your protective factors are your family."
14464.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"And not wanting to leave them with a mess to clean up. or leave them in pain and suffering. Is there any other protective factors, do you have pets or friends or anything like that."
14464.0,Patient,We do have pets.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, would you say that that's a protective factor not wanting to leave your pets."
14464.0,Patient,"Women, I guess, maybe, maybe a little bit of course my pets would have the rest of my family but."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
14464.0,Patient,"Of course I mentioned, I don't want to put myself in physical pain."
706.0,Provider,Physical pain.
14464.0,Patient,and blood.
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm. All right, and then, what would you say are your. aggravating factors like what causes you to feel that way."
14464.0,Patient,um. Maybe. Just some have some random if some random train of thought suddenly leaves me leads me down a direction that's more upsetting or I end up accidentally reading a chain of comments on the Internet that are upsetting.
706.0,Provider,Comments towards you.
14464.0,Patient,"Not necessarily towards me it actually usually isn't because i've kind of gradually stopped engaging but even just reading other people's conversations and arguments with each other, can be enough. Okay, is sometimes it can feel like stuff is directed at me, even if they don't even know exist."
706.0,Provider,"So sometimes you feel like even though it's not directed at you, it could be like they could put your name in there and it would fit."
14464.0,Patient,"You know, sometimes. Like I know i've had to unfollow some of my Facebook friends, because they keep posting means stuff can rant some stuff that we're upsetting."
706.0,Provider,Do you feel like when you have those feelings that you want to die or that you want to kill yourself that you're in a depression.
14464.0,Patient,And some anxiety to Russia and anxiety okay.
706.0,Provider,"So, would you say that heightened Depression and anxiety can cause those aggravating or aggravating factors."
14464.0,Patient,Here I guess so.
706.0,Provider,Anything else that you can think of.
14464.0,Patient,"I think the depression is probably worse, the links ID for that sort of thing. we're asleep. Some flashbacks to stuff that's happened but but I guess Those are just causes of anxiety and depression. And i'm not sure if you can even call them flashbacks since i'm still conscious of where and when I actually."
706.0,Provider,So. And what do you see in those flashbacks.
14464.0,Patient,"When I can still see the stuff that's actually around me but i'm also kind of imagining pictures and videos in my head. And feeling, all the same feeling, so I did when it happened okay."
706.0,Provider,"And, and what what what are you talking when when it happened, what is it."
14464.0,Patient,Some some time when I like got yelled at or something or. Like.
706.0,Provider,emotional abuse.
14464.0,Patient,"I guess. Or if I just got in trouble, because I didn't realize what I did was wrong, even if it was it turns out, it should have been obvious okay okay."
706.0,Provider,"All right, well, we can talk a little bit more about that as we go on um so we talked about your suicidal ideation What about homicidal ideation do you ever have thoughts of hurting other people are killing other people."
14464.0,Patient,"Sometimes, I imagine, reaching through screens on the Internet and using superpowers to kill annoying people who post stuff in the comments."
706.0,Provider,But never actually like. You want to. Take a weapon of any kind and hurt somebody or kill somebody.
14464.0,Patient,Is not not seriously.
706.0,Provider,um do you have any self injurious behavior cutting or burning or anything like that.
14464.0,Patient,Sometimes I hit my hand with a plastic brewer where I might pinch myself.
706.0,Provider,How long's that been that how long has that been going on.
14464.0,Patient,i'm not sure exactly some number of years okay.
706.0,Provider,And when you do that behavior when you have to slap yourself a pinch yourself what are you trying to do.
14464.0,Patient,"Well, sometimes it's a form of punishing myself and sometimes it's more a form of distraction from. from whatever i'm thinking about okay okay."
706.0,Provider,um. What medications are you currently taking for your mental health.
14464.0,Patient,"See. i've got wellbutrin. 450 milligrams daily of wellbutrin. and let's see and some abuse grown 50 milligram tablet twice a day. I think that's it right now I feel like I have actually gotten a little better, since i've taken the wellbutrin but i'm not cured get just a little better this the wellbutrin is just within the past few months I switched. I switched off of sertraline because it felt like it wasn't working so my doctor switched it to wellbutrin instead. Okay it's done a little bit, although it took some time for it to take effect because, like the first few weeks it was worse, and then it started to get better."
706.0,Provider,"Okay um you had mentioned that your mom had some mental health issues, what is your family history of mental health."
14464.0,Patient,"Oh. My mom Scott so stuff, obviously, and I know at least one of my grandparents has anxiety i'm not sure about the others, I know it was I don't mind at least one does."

706.0,Provider,What about dad do you know about dad.
14464.0,Patient,"um he has I know he has ADHD. I don't think there's anything else, although man he's been showing more signs of stress and anxiety, since all the stuff with my mom happened at least i've noticed him showing more signs of that. Okay, so this was my mom six that meant he had to do a walk or."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm. um any family history of substances.
14464.0,Patient,"I think. I think one of my grandparents did some drugs and alcohol. I never really knew all that well. I only met him once or twice, but probably because he was out doing the other stuff and I think."

Years then like somewhere around when I was a teenager my mom concerned, but I was concerned I wasn't learning certain things so she put me in an alternative high school program but. Okay, the high school program was pretty stressful but I don't think it was particularly traumatic. I didn't have any really social trouble I just sort of didn't interact with people that much and my God, along with my teachers so most of it was just having a lot of work to do. and less flexibility."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, you weren't you just kind of kept to yourself, you didn't really socialize with your peers."

14464.0,Patient,"I like to read and I like to draw and I kind of like to write, although I haven't been doing that the writing is much past few years, actually don't draw as much as I like to because I often don't feel very well. But i've managed to start reading more lately, and instead of playing games on the computer or my phone or watching videos."
706.0,Provider,"Okay um how old, are you right now. 27 seven um How would you say your stress level is day today."
14464.0,Patient,It kind of. goes up and down a little bit probably somewhere from five to eight usually on average okay.
706.0,Provider,And what are the major stressors that caused that anxiety to go up.
14464.0,Patient,i'm usually my own thoughts or accidentally seeing something upsetting on the Internet.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
14464.0,Patient,"So I don't because someone's lately i've rarely gotten any gotten had as much trouble had any trouble with getting in trouble with my family, I guess, because i've learned to suppress more of my emotions."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and how is your sleeping habits."
14464.0,Patient,"know my sleep schedule is kind of twisted and upside down I usually sleep, most of the day and i'm awake most of the night."
706.0,Provider,"um. How, how are you eating habits."
14464.0,Patient,"and When I wake up the first meal of the day is dinner. And then, like. Some time like maybe two to four in the morning, I might have a second meal. and"
706.0,Provider,Completely flipped upside down from what they would say a normal day is.
14464.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, in the past i've had a third meal in between dinner and breakfast but. I haven't as much, partly because of some i've kind of lost my appetite a bit, and also because i'm overweight and I kind of want to lose some weight, but i'm often often don't feel well enough to exercise. So i've just been trying to cut down on eating this much."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, what about activities of daily living are you able to you know get up get cleaned up brush teeth take shower get dressed and kind of live your day Okay, or do you struggle with that."
14464.0,Patient,"I mean I I usually brush and floss my teeth, every day, unless I feel too tired or nauseous. And even then i'll try to do it. I actually often don't I often don't change my clothes very off and i'll just put on some clothes and then wear them for the next couple weeks even sleeping in them before they start being noticeably stinky and then I might change. change them."
706.0,Provider,Do you shower and then put them back on or do you not shower.
14464.0,Patient,"Occasionally, I shower but not very often."
706.0,Provider,Okay okay um. So how do you feel like your self esteem as.
14464.0,Patient,I think it's usually pretty low OK OK.
706.0,Provider,So those are awesome things that we can work on is kind of getting those at al's which they're called activities have.
14464.0,Patient,A little more.
706.0,Provider,"Consistent which will obviously increase your self esteem and will help with your sleep patterns, it will help with your eating patterns will help with your. Maybe your energy levels and your ability to want to make positive change so Those are all good things that we can work on that's why I was asking you so many."
14464.0,Patient,"i'm in my sleep schedule my sleeping patterns have been pretty wonky all my life. yeah and then gradually, over the past few years it's putting getting pushed later and later and later."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and I think part of that might be due to the fact you don't have a lot going on during the day, so you sleep, the day away and then at night, you can kind of be by yourself. And just kind of keep to yourself and do the things that you want to do, and so that's kind of the time that you feel most comfortable."
14464.0,Patient,um the.
706.0,Provider,"The goal would be to kind of flip flop that around a little bit because that way you can interact with people you know and live life, rather than just exist and life."
14464.0,Patient,"I do have a few hours with my family because, like I have dinner with them and then I take take care of my little brother until his bedtime so it ends up being like four or five hours. Occasionally i'll have another parent with me."
706.0,Provider,Do you feel like is your family has any objections to the way that you're living as far as sleeping all day staying up all night. With their ad and things like that.
14464.0,Patient,"When I think they'd probably prefer I were up at least a little bit earlier, although they don't mind me being at least kind of late sleep schedule, but right now it's kind of extreme."
706.0,Provider,Okay that's fair.
14464.0,Patient,"I think they'd probably prefer it if I shower more often, but then they stopped. let's say stop pestering me about it a long time ago, because it just made me more stressed."
706.0,Provider,"that's understandable so i'm we're done with your bps I wasn't too terrible with it. Okay, good, so what the next step is is that you'll want to go back to the virtual clinic and you'll want to set up some therapy sessions."
14464.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,And then we can start with therapy and just work through anything that it is you want to work through. and hopefully make some improvements.
14464.0,Patient,For her to worry setups therapy with the virtual clinic.

Okay, all right bye Angela. Angela Perkins as that medium suicide risk. Her protective factors include her family not wanting them to go through pain and suffering her pets and then also her fear of the physical pain of dying. aggravating factors include random trains of thoughts or comments on the Internet that can include arguments or conversations, not necessarily directed at her, but when she reads them she thinks they could be directed at her. High heightened Depression and anxiety is also an aggravating factor and then she said flashbacks but she has no trauma and her history that she has. explained during her bps just she said random thoughts of people yelling at her and her past but not an abusive way she has no plans and no intent on following through with suicide."
