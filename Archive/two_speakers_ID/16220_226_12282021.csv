So yeah it's been very weird and scattered so it's kind of hard to like. plan to do anything when all you really want to do is just stay home and stay dry, you know."

16220.0,Patient,and
226.0,Provider,"I have two groups on Friday, and so, if the doctors don't want to well if they don't want to cancel the group. Then we do the group. But also it's really hard like I didn't work, last Friday, so to cancel two groups."
16220.0,Patient,in Australia.
226.0,Provider,it's early that's not a good idea.
16220.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So yeah probably working on Friday. I know it's weird ever since i've been doing this, though i've looked at every. New Jersey. or robot yeah. Okay yeah for the most part it's just. it's just basing."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean it's kind of weird because I know with a couple friends. They are also getting new year's Eve off. But from what I remember, I mean. Usually it's always what is it new year's day if it falls on a weekday you usually get that off correct. pipeline and so it's really weird since meteors actually falls on Saturday. yeah so I figured usually they would carry it over to the third right."
226.0,Provider,"yeah you can either do typically need to do the Friday, or you can do the Monday. Sunday and on. Sometimes it just depends on your preference. So typically it would, for us, it would have been Friday. Okay, but. it's just too busy. Okay, this not having sad because I have, I have private practice clients to. Not working on Saturday, just like me."
16220.0,Patient,Oh. yeah I mean it's.
226.0,Provider,Time to get people scheduled yeah.
16220.0,Patient,Thank you get back to normal right.
226.0,Provider,"And then take about three weeks just from this in one day. yeah it's crazy that's good I mean it's all good. I think it I think it's Okay, you know just kind of slide into the New Year."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean i'm sure your your patients are your clients are probably the same way it's just more of a you know you missed when one day yeah and i'll tell you, you said you have three days off, so you know."
226.0,Provider,"I usually work on Saturdays because I say, I have a private practice clients."
16220.0,Patient,"Okay, but that off all the secrets of Christmas and right."
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And even doing a group on Christmas Eve, and my guessing a lot of people didn't show up they're traveling. they're getting ready, you know it's. it's hard to hit and miss."
16220.0,Patient,"You know, and I think even this Friday probably missed it over."
226.0,Provider,we'll see how many people show.
16220.0,Patient,Why don't you I mean I don't know if you're able to wake up like send out an email to your patients and asked hey like are you looking to join a group I mean if it's just. You know i'm just gonna pull see what you would expect.
226.0,Provider,"Sometimes we do that, sometimes, or sometimes we ask the client call in my. Opinion if they're going to miss, because if they miss it's considered a no show if you called and it's considered a cancellation and that's fine. So and usually people are pretty good not going to read I don't want yeah."
16220.0,Patient,Okay okay.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so will will will see let's see what happens. Are you doing anything for the new year, I mean, but how do you celebrate."
16220.0,Patient,"I mean it's hit or miss, I mean the last few years, I haven't done a thing, usually we would a at the time, be at my girlfriend's house or girlfriend's parents house. Just to spend a few hours because usually her dad works holidays."
226.0,Provider,I guess.
16220.0,Patient,"yeah so you wouldn't need to be home until like 1011 maybe even 12 they've been held up there, so. yeah at the at the time it would end up being that her mom my girlfriend's mom would be home by yourself. Oh, we would always come over for a few hours at least a secret company and stuff like that."
226.0,Provider,Because you're gonna see do restaurant work.
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah he works at a restaurant so it's. I know. it's pretty grueling, especially now, because of. Worker shortage. So, but yeah I mean this is a little bit different because we're already there so it's a little bit easier to not have to worry about like going anywhere this this year."
226.0,Provider,yeah that's. me okay.
16220.0,Patient,"So yeah other than that, no, no other can. Maybe see a couple friends during the day, but I mean because of the whole overall kronur need Gary."
226.0,Provider,We don't have a.
16220.0,Patient,girlfriend and certainly don't want to do anything.
226.0,Provider,But yeah.
16220.0,Patient,"it's almost like lockdown again, you know report, you know."
226.0,Provider,that's kind of what I was getting i'm i'm hearing some of the schools are pushing back the students coming back on campus two weeks.
16220.0,Patient,Depending on yeah yeah heard something that they just tried it for how badasses and. What they can do or they're just going to revert back to the old. Old restrictions. I have no idea.
226.0,Provider,"So, are you hearing any California schools that are thinking of doing that, like."
16220.0,Patient,"No, no, and in that nothing goes so far yeah I think the majority. Are I guess on edge or write about think. San Diego ELISE has really done anything to change. I mean they done where if you're in a public area indoors, then you have to wear a mask shopping and restaurants and things like that, but I don't think i've heard of any any new restrictions are rules for for this."
226.0,Provider,God. was really hoping we could. add a.
16220.0,Patient,"little later on this year. I. start the new year as actually year. So I have no idea and we hopefully this all just gets better, but who knows when that's gonna happen."
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I do know people are catching it, though I think I, personally, I know a lot of people at a patent."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah good friend of mine this past Christmas actually he got it. had been reading reading issues and check like. really bad. chest congestion, I think what it was telling me and he was actually in the Christmas Eve. So it was interesting because he. yeah wasn't expecting it just it just hit him like after you woke up from a nap or something. There so."
226.0,Provider,Okay.
16220.0,Patient,"yeah he's good he I believe he can discharge, they just gave him. I forget what kind of treatment and he said that he was back to. feeling like normal within a day. But obviously they have to keep there for a couple days I think just a monitor and make sure it's gone and testing but yeah so far from what he's told me he sees good."
226.0,Provider,Did you see me um I just I think this morning that it's the quarantine time is gone down to five days versus 10 days.
16220.0,Patient,"Yes, 10 to 14 years whatever. So i'm hoping. I know it's just weird but I don't know how this new variant or whatever works I don't know you know if for 14 or five days or whatever it's going to be enough for you know I don't know, but I feel like. I don't know 1010 days I think should have a time. For it but."
226.0,Provider,I hope it doesn't you know turn into another lockdown situation.
16220.0,Patient,"Right like I would be devastating to everyone, because I don't think anybody. be able handle it again because no."
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely well. My clay yeah like. can't yeah it's it's kind of one of those things where it's just crazy, how are your parent or your parents concerned about it, or do they."
16220.0,Patient,"Are they are concerned, but I mean being who they are it's more of just you know they're, at least with their line of work it's a bit easier because you're not in front of a customer 24 seven most times it's you know, the drop off the car and then. You know either wait, or just leave and come back and pick it up later I mean. The most I tell my parents at this point is, you know, like the steering wheels and handles and things you touch you know, even though they have gloves on you know try try to clean it up a bit. Before touching them. kind of thing, but I mean that's usually just the basics for anything really like washing hands are like you know clean surfaces touched or. You know so."
226.0,Provider,I definitely. Have you noticed that kind of a shelter bear out there.
16220.0,Patient,"very ugly and honestly, most of our shopping from i've seen has been costco like we would go like or at least my girlfriend's mom would go super early in the morning."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
16220.0,Patient,To try to beat the crowd.
226.0,Provider,"I the shelves, are they bear and costco."
16220.0,Patient,"not bear what I mean it's just you, you know that it's a hell of a lot busier now than it was like you know, four months ago, and I think you know what people already got used to how the mandates or whatever things they thought that we're we're getting better. Now you see lots of people just messing like supplies, but I mean it's I think costco has been strict in terms of how much you can buy. yeah you know, like toilet paper and stuff like that yeah so I was a nice."
226.0,Provider,Thank you.
16220.0,Patient,"Yes, I don't understand, I mean it's not like we are we don't have running water, you can. Take a shower anything that afterwards. If need be, you know."
226.0,Provider,yeah so interesting.
16220.0,Patient,"I figure food is that we should have, in the first. But you know any mean. it's not obviously so."
226.0,Provider,"So how are you feeling like tell me. I think it, I think."
16220.0,Patient,"I mean nothing really has to happen to trigger right what happened last last week. Right, but I mean. Like I said i've literally been home, I mean other than like the walks and just you know general like sometimes girlfriend wants to go shopping so we'll go i'll go out with her stuff like that, but. Nothing really I mean Christmas is fun, we visited my parents for a little bit talks caught up a bit. And went over to girlfriend's parents. Back home and then just hung out there, I mean it's. it's a very interesting dynamic, seeing that i'm from you know, going from one house to another. But I mean it's not bad not bad at all I enjoy seeing it parents, I mean it's interesting for me again it's just called in a culture shock but it's. An interesting change between going from one set of parents to another. Then. Just keeping myself busy honestly."
226.0,Provider,We didn't.
16220.0,Patient,"Like I said we didn't do much for Christmas, I solve both of the parents and. My parents often not to go do anything this year just because I think. They just weren't in the mood, for I think. Are you do something for new year, so maybe. You know, go out to eat or something like that."
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
16220.0,Patient,yeah not not not not much not very gentle. yeah like I said it was cold wet and and yeah just didn't want to leave the House on and say.
226.0,Provider,"Oh. Good. So it sounds like things are pretty status quo, you know not too many highs and not too many lows seems like it's kind of steady right."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah for now. i'm hoping says, I will, I know it's, not just because life in general. I am probably going back to a more. Well, basically, I think, starting sometime next month. Are we going. To work more often. So."
226.0,Provider,"I think that's great I think if you're ready and you're feeling like yep I can do this every i've got that i've got the energy to do that, I think it's a good idea. I mean, I certainly wouldn't. I mean if it's not feeling right, you know, listen to yourself okay so, so I think it's I do feel like it's important I think it's the next I think it's the next like important step to take, and. You know, creating we talked about like a routine you know kind of getting like this is a really good way to get yourself back into. The swing of just you know, creating more of a routine for yourself and working. And you know kind of starting out slow and just kind of monitoring how you doing monitoring your interactions with your parents like how they're making me feel like what's happening here like how am I reacting if i'm if you are. You know, you might not be like oh my God, you know. It might be okay, so this is just about you know kind of pacing yourself."
16220.0,Patient,What is yeah.
226.0,Provider,So yeah I think it's a great idea.
16220.0,Patient,So we'll see how that how that works out.
226.0,Provider,For you i'm going to sit paving. I you.
16220.0,Patient,"Know i'm not I mean i'm. I mean it's almost I prepared for the worst hope for the best kind of thing but it's more just seeing how it goes, I mean i've had interactions with my parents and I wondering if it's going to still have that awkwardness. Is what i'm really boring. wondering about like how, how is it going to be, you know interacting with my parents versus just working. I think working itself. You know, would be nice but it's also the place, I work i'm going to be in. interacting with my parents versus just you know another job or you know, separate from them. You know because I guess you know it comes, you know. The strings attached, but like package deal. yeah if I go to work then i'm going to be seeing my parents."
226.0,Provider,"yeah, but I also feel like it's important to do."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean i'm looking forward to it i'm just you know wondering like how, how is it going to be between my parents like once you know I start going back to work on a more consistent basis."
226.0,Provider,How do you want it to be.
16220.0,Patient,"um, I would like the awkwardness to go away, I mean, I know, eventually, it will just probably not in PEM soon. And just see how it goes, I mean, I feel that you know I want to go back to work. For the time being. and see if this is really something I want to pursue."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
16220.0,Patient,"Right, you know I still have. be expunged man on the table which I mean, I think, at this point, I still want to do, regardless just for my own peace of mind."
226.0,Provider,yeah I agree.
16220.0,Patient,"yeah I mean at this point, you know I have options just waiting to see if there are more options."
226.0,Provider,"So sick what even if you decide hey you know what i'm going to just stay working with my pants yeah I really like I feel like you should just follow that expansion and all the way. I think that's I think that's really smart and I think like you said peace of mind and. You never know right. it's like you're just you're just out it just gives you know, the possibility of other opportunities for notes."
16220.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
226.0,Provider,yeah just like like remaining open.
16220.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's always just nice to have. yeah you know I mean I don't know what the future holds I mean you know, in the neck if I decide to do the you know the family business, you know, and then you know, five or six years either it's something happens where. You know it's not sustainable, I still have an option, you know, beyond that, to basically cover my ass."
226.0,Provider,"I agree. i'm just really smart. So how many days a week, do you feel you're you're going to go back any idea."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I saw her so in the works with my parents, I mean, I think, at least two days a week i've told them that I have to have teasers off. Just for my therapy and just it would be weird to. Since I only work till about three or four depending on how busy they are. And then lunch and everything I literally wouldn't be able to get there. Until like noon and then we're like two or three hours because I mean you know I am sessions with you around 11. Then I would you know eat a quick lunch and head down there, and by that time, that would be 12."
226.0,Provider,Right and.
16220.0,Patient,"Then you know work for another two three hours and go back home, it would be kind of well, let me three or four, I guess, but yeah it would be kind of weird instead of just been there, the whole day."
226.0,Provider,yeah okay.
16220.0,Patient,"It was it was just more of a. I don't know if it's gonna be more than two days i'm assuming at least two days. Well, we use your opener on eight. And, two, three or four depending on like I said it's the cutoff is usually around three."
226.0,Provider,But then.
16220.0,Patient,"You know they'll stay a bit i'll stay open later, depending on how busy they are, or if they have like appointments coming in at. 330 or something."
226.0,Provider,So for this certification that you got you know. Are you guys can start taking. You know people that need those cars.
16220.0,Patient,"So I mean that'll definitely up my workload, which is nice because I mean. The inspection itself isn't hard."
226.0,Provider,uh huh.
16220.0,Patient,"And i'm just surprised what people don't do it, but at the same time, I can understand because their test is a pain, the ass on it's a it's a huge pain in the ass yeah because I mean like I said there's no real like. Study guide for. You to know it don't basically basic I took it a few times and got to the point where it was nothing like the test that took four years prior to that. They had updated new questions new info things like that, and what really stuck out in my mind was there was a lot of hypothetical scenario. Questions which. don't pertain to anything that I read in any book or or like. law or. Regulation book. yeah you know, like What do you do if this happens i'm like this is how am I supposed to know if it's. In."
226.0,Provider,The book yeah.
16220.0,Patient,"Well, and so that's what really I think. screwed a lot of people over when they want it to renew. Just because these hypotheticals aren't covered anywhere and a lot of that stuff is like. What would you do kind of scenario versus what the right thing is and an artist like I said I think most of those in my mind trick questions in a sense, because you know a lot of the information that you need I mean isn't really are a lot of the information you need to do the inspection. isn't like carrot from you like, if you need it there's a book there's a little handbook That said, like. What color lights need to be like what height ethan to be. Things like that, so I feel like it's funny how you have to memorize all this, but when you're actually doing the inspection, just like you like there's resources that you can use on. Hand versus. You know, having to memorize all this."
226.0,Provider,"yeah crazy. Good he'll have you know, hopefully you'll have. you'll have extra business from that."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean my mom has already contacted like servers and data anywhere we're doing this again, you know sorry to be so like not being able to do for. I think three months. Exactly but. yeah just. A load off of the off my shoulders now. I don't worry about this for another three and a half, four years."
226.0,Provider,"Good Nicole. fun. So I feel like things are you know, like like I said, every week it's just like kind of monitoring like. Now, where you are so. It feels like things are moving in the right direction. that things are. I think you've got a little bit more clarity, I think you feel a bit more grounded I think you're not as anxious. yep things will come up always does that's like the. flow of life right and so it's just like, how do you how do you get your reaction and then, how do you just move through that. So you'll get practice."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's just like like we talked my life like it'll happen, I just have to figure out how to handle it at that point and. The more the more i'm able to handle things obviously more practice."
226.0,Provider,"yeah right absolutely, so I think for you it's about not getting. overwhelmed. With the the emotions that come with certain situations and not getting flooded the point where you don't have perspective. So you get so flooded with these feelings of maybe self doubt self blame guilt shame frustration anxiety anger, all these different emotions, but. And then you can't you know it takes you a moment to kind of step back and put things in perspective. For you it's not it's not about. You you want to watch the self blame. goes the self blame you should kind of what takes you out. Though you want to have perspective, like Okay, is it just hypothetically Okay, is this just my parents reacting to a situation. Or is this something that i've done so, if it's something that i've done and I need to have a conversation with them like okay with. me or if it's just something that's angered one of them, because it's a bad day. You know you don't have to take all of that, on. You can separate from it and go hey I can see you're having a bad day there's something that can do to help. And if they say no you're like Okay, then you go about your business. So it's really about not parking all of that stuff inside of you so having like a protective barrier almost like you just have this wall that doesn't let stuff doesn't penetrate. And you'll have practice something will come up you know, but it doesn't have to be catastrophic it doesn't have to you know it's it's it's about not. You know, making it into this enormous huge thing. That it really isn't. that's where you want to remain focused and never really check in with yourself like Okay, am I going down this rabbit hole like it's happening for me. And if you feel like that's happening now, you need to take take a breath now you take a step back, take a deep breath. So the goal is to not have get flooded with all those kind of emotions and then that keeps you in that loop in your head."
16220.0,Patient,But just perpetuates worse and worse worse.
226.0,Provider,"Right and that lead keeps going and going and going and as that tape going and going to keep blaming yourself in one day my God my God, what did I do today. So that's that cognitive distortion catastrophizing. That ruminating. That thought process that loop. You want to be able to stop that and gain perspective around what just happened and do I even have a part in this. Most likely no. honestly. Like most likely the adult there's just you know, remembering your parents or your parents, this is how they respond, this is how they. don't have to be pulled into it and, like and squashed. Because your parents have their own way they have their own communication style like you know, like you were saying it's interesting going from your parents house to your girlfriend's parents House like culture, we have to. You know i'm just keeping that in mind, and that you don't have to be drawn in and take it out. It doesn't have to emotionally splashy. yeah."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah so I guess i'm. hoping for the best of prayer for the worse yeah I mean you know just. i'll see what happens and no worse comes to worse if I. take a step back, take a break or talk to somebody."
226.0,Provider,"Right absolutely. And also, you know really start to visualize like how you want it to be like start to really visualize how you want your interactions with your parents to be like kind of put that out there. So instead of going okay well up here for the worst hope the best they okay Well, no, this is how I envisioned my conversations going, this is how in video in my interactions with my parents going, this is how I see like when I go into work, this is how my days are going to be. Okay yeah they're going to be busy and i'm going to be working and i'm going to have really positive interactions with my fans. The concert thinking about that putting that out there too. But I call them, you know that's manifesting how you want things to point out. Because remember if you live in like doubt in fear you get down here that come comes to you. it's that law of attraction. There if you're building like I described it as scarcity model versus abundance so scarcity model is like fear anxiety depression low self esteem or self worth things aren't going to work out that scarcity versus abundance, which is like oh yeah everything always works out. yeah i'm having a really great day, my day job right. My interactions are really positive so when you have when you're in abundance and gratitude and gratitude more abundance comes. weird scarcity mode. it's really difficult for things to come. Because it's just. it's just an energy. That happens."
16220.0,Patient,"it's just basically saying positive things case, then things will happen."
226.0,Provider,"Have you ever heard of the secret of having a rat watch that it's called the secret and I think it's on that books. No, I you know if you're a client I would I would check it out and it's it's about the law it's the law of attraction. Like what you put out you get back. it's like how to create it's really how to create abundance in your life, just like, with your thinking and your mindset."
16220.0,Patient,Like a documentary or more.
226.0,Provider,yeah let me see if it's. Working fine. Now I think there's a buck. Richard. secret. yeah. So just put in the secret just go into netflix and put in the secret and I will come up with a heartfelt inspiring documentary.
16220.0,Patient,it's obvious maybe I can get something can make regular watch with me.
226.0,Provider,Absolutely highly recommend that. and See if there's anything that has. A burn a Brown is also really good to put in a brown box top shane is like the person talks about shame and guilt. there's some good stuff destitute definitely watch it with your Program.
16220.0,Patient,"Okay, so when when she gets off working she has time tonight, or maybe over the weekend, or something."
226.0,Provider,"yeah totally. I think it's maybe like it's under two hours. So yeah do that and. i'll be curious to see what you think about it. it's a new it's definitely. Like a very new way of thinking and kind of living and being in the world. And not we're not taught that you know we're not taught that just crazy. and We should be teaching in school, we should be teaching meditation and breathing. You know, like the way we do things to be different."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean. money. The world, so I mean. I think mental health and mental stability isn't something that. You know top priority in terms of what it's taught in school and basically the world."
226.0,Provider,Right absolutely and it needs to be. Very.
16220.0,Patient,least at least more attention to mental health.
226.0,Provider,I feel like.
16220.0,Patient,"Because of career, I think it's been much more apparent issue. Then before."
226.0,Provider,I was created a global mental health crisis. is locked down and not have consequences emotional mental consequences. it's a school or socialization. it's maybe on college campuses.
16220.0,Patient,"yeah I mean even just going to work and socialize with coworkers me it's better than just being at home by yourself and. You know, not having any kind of like social outlet."
226.0,Provider,"was very difficult for many, many people not being able to go into an office kept them structured cut them connected. Closing down all these universities in this clip kind of. Guy and. Then his costume them they kidding me. Like anything."
16220.0,Patient,"So I mean my brother luckily brushing our teeth bye bye bye bye brother was in the middle of all this, too, I mean he went from classes on campus to zoom. Luckily, it was towards his last year or actual it wasn't last year. So it wasn't too bad like he. didn't have much in the live classes, it was more of. His internships and things like that, but even then like he saw a huge difference from like we had first started working. pharmacy like. That the beginning. Before Kobe into the beginning of a way from super super busy to like almost Why did I even go to work."
226.0,Provider,and I know it's incredible that's my hope is on the accounting doesn't shut us down.
16220.0,Patient,"Right, where I was devastated and I don't think like you said, like economically I don't think they can do it again. yeah, especially because of. All the issues that came up when people wanted to do stuff couldn't because quote unquote the law says you can't but i'm not going to get it."
226.0,Provider,yeah no kidding yeah just not good for small businesses and.
16220.0,Patient,Then that just means everything else is going to go up in price again.
226.0,Provider,that's why I know keep my fingers crossed.
16220.0,Patient,"I know i'm i'm sure it's the same thing for Ecuador, but I mean, like everything like just food, and you know everything is just. skyrocketing like in terms of pricing it's just like. I don't think wages are going to do to keep up."
226.0,Provider,Now.
16220.0,Patient,When I say don't.
226.0,Provider,Know inflation right. just do not keep up with inflation. possible. Do not crazy.

226.0,Provider,And then.
16220.0,Patient,"You know you honestly, you know mathematically economically you can't. Unless you have you know. tool or eight, maybe even triple income."
226.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I think that's also my family's I live in together again most. People have you know comics have kids have moved back home, and you know. Come. Up families under one roof again now, you know it's not so bad, but economically they need that."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Totally that's all like at least I know it's not going to do anyway anytime soon, but I mean galeazzi at least some kind of. yeah you know some kind of like. Light shining from wherever so kind of hope. That word."
226.0,Provider,So I think I don't think I have you in our next.
16220.0,Patient,Our.
226.0,Provider,case so before.
16220.0,Patient,"I think I do actually. Let me double check, because I have emails. For ladies right heart. And I think we're all women, yes, is this January for so yeah Tuesday."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so they sent you any. yeah."
16220.0,Patient,"Okay, send me an email, so I I. don't know if I have anything after the fourth, though, so I don't know if you wanted to see what you see the rest of your schedule like is for January."
226.0,Provider,"So we can do, we can do the webinar. So we'll do up until then and let's just kind of see where you are, and then we could do like every other week we'll just see how you are."
16220.0,Patient,"Okay i'm kind of curious also Sean I wanted to ask you um let's see sessions. Is there a mandatory mandatory cut off point, or is it is more as long as I need it, or as long as I want it. OK."
226.0,Provider,"So the thing that. The thing that i'm interested in is like so typically what they make people do like it's kind of it's a requirement and if they want they want the. site, they want client student group as well as individual content, so I know that that was something that you had worked out. When you did your intake so that might come up. or just I don't know i'm just putting it out there. And if it does, then we'll just address it, as it as it comes, but as of right now you're just doing because you're not on medication right."
16220.0,Patient,"No, no, I mean. yeah I don't think I need to I mean. we're also going to talk to dump unique about that. I mean I don't feel I need it, I mean it's always nice to have the option for me right now right I just haven't really put much thought into you know medication."
226.0,Provider,So did they suggest medication when you are in the hospital.
16220.0,Patient,"um yeah well, it was with the hospital hospital, it was mainly just flush whatever is in my system out when a wait and see how I how I improve the mental health hospital. The doctor doctor there. was a psychiatrist was basically. which I didn't like at the time, basically was prescribing medication, without even getting to know who I was."
226.0,Provider,First yeah right.
16220.0,Patient,And so I didn't like it at all. So I denied that a. medication.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, do you remember what you wanted to what the doctor wanted to be on."
16220.0,Patient,yeah i'm looking for that paper. It was shraddha Dome and view pro game. yeah. Be propane and try that out where the two I.
226.0,Provider,didn't really having trouble sleeping.
16220.0,Patient,i'm. A was mean the. first couple days at meant that the second hospital was just because it was a different kind of bed and.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
16220.0,Patient,"You know, different surroundings and things like that, and then also the fact that my roommate at the time was a fairly heavy snore. God yeah so I was just I had asked them, you know, like, if I can get earplugs and I think they took that the wrong way."
226.0,Provider,Okay. So i'm not sure.
16220.0,Patient,"yeah it was kind of weird like I would toss and turn a bit, but I mean I think at that point, it was just more getting me so my surroundings versus actual. I guess mental health issues, keeping me from sleeping."
226.0,Provider,"yeah okay that's that's kind of what I was thinking, did you end up taking any of the tabs down when you. know."
16220.0,Patient,"I didn't take anything where they work they. didn't take any period be a prescribed me, or at least a. what's it called gave me. yeah like I said, like it was weird I hadn't even talked to the psychiatrist and they're like yeah you know he suggests that you should start taking this medication like why like he don't even know my situation, you have to talk to me yet you're already pushing pills, to me, you know."
226.0,Provider,"Right yeah. yeah so I don't you know, unless you're experiencing like some some depression, which i'm not picking up on and some like anxiety which i'm not giving up on. I don't I don't see why you need medication."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean i'm not gonna lie to you, I mean there are times, where it does get sometimes like you know throughout the day or like just randomly like last night thinking things and like. just get so depressed or anxious about certain things, especially like you know when there's things that have to do, but I can't do them just yet. And I think I get kind of anxious i'm not going to like like you know it's just more like I want to get it done so I don't have to deal, deal with it again. kind of thing, like the tests like it was super interesting know studying for it. No just because a like I wanted to get it over and be it was a what is it I. want to get to my best, at the same time, like, I wanted to make sure I got enough time in before my my test, because you basically get to schedule your own testing. And so it was mainly like do I have enough time to study, but at the same time, I just want to get it over with you know and and see what happens from there. So I don't know if that makes any sense to you."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so that's like considered like that situational. So yeah again so that's Okay, so you know, like I get that part but that's totally understandable so. You know that would be like. If you're feeling like that every single day now. Okay yeah yeah so that's. That would be really difficult because that was just a situational That was a you know that's very different."
16220.0,Patient,So that.
226.0,Provider,"that's normal to have some anxiety around. You know, because it's performance and memorization and it's work related and all that stuff so that's. that's normal and then you know they're those coping skills that you can do to you know just like breathing exercises that you know those visual meditations which I highly suggest that you know that you start to incorporate you know doing some of that stuff just as relaxation technique. that's going to really help your you know your your central nervous system, so when something happens then you're not going to be just like on edge as much so it's really about managing your your your parasympathetic nervous. So anything like relaxation. breathing. Kenny stretching."
16220.0,Patient,"joker yeah I mean it's usually, when it gets a quick i'll i'll bust out the dumbbells and she said exercise. yeah just something to get my mind off of it, but I mean. it's really, really cool."
226.0,Provider,"yeah no I get it, I mean I know it's really hard to like get motivated when it's when it's cold out yeah. yeah I totally get it, I know. So you know when you start to like when you have. You know, when you feel like you can. do some of that again start doing that. Any kind of exercising anything like you know moving your body like getting that energy of your. Energy out. it's really, really important. Just like having having like an exercise routine or something that you do you know just for yourself really important at least doing it three times a week. So, as you start to feel a little bit stronger I would recommend that you do that. That will help you."
16220.0,Patient,"Today yeah I mean I you know, like I said I have fleets i've done them on occasion I mean before I was more of a structured thing but. Ever since that super cold I just sort of. yeah like stopped, and I said."
226.0,Provider,"yeah no I get it, you know it's it's some. You know, some people do really well in cold weather and you know fairly well and hotter weather so."
16220.0,Patient,"yeah I mean like I love, I prefer the cold over over hot, but I mean it's just it's weird because. You know, at the time, what they got home most tired and thing. Then all this happened and. Basically, my schedule went from you know, a structured schedule. And to like everything up in the air, again, you know staying home or something or being at home, most of the time versus being at work. You know, trying to do things to keep yourself occupied, you know I love playing locks that even if it's just on the block a few times it's you know it's fun. You get the fresh air."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
16220.0,Patient,"You know, at the time you get sunshine, but."
226.0,Provider,yeah yeah. Okay sounds good all right anything else that you want to go oh.

I have already put much stock in a House I mean like I said this. last few weeks have been very release before or after the whole. parenting we talked about everything. You know from there on was very uneventful. Like it was just you know. Like you said, the status quo like. We all do things go out on air and that's really."
226.0,Provider,Okay that's good you know that's life that's living living without drama living without kale that's normal that's normal.
