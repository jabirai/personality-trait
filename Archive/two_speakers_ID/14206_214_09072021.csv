14206.0,Patient,caitlin Anderson six.
214.0,Provider,that's why you been.
14206.0,Patient,"Oh i've been a noun mostly down um. I had a let's see i'm trying to think of when our last therapy was appointment or our last therapy appointment was um. I had a breakdown on Monday, how to break down on Wednesday. I had a breakdown on Sunday, and then I called my psychiatrist and she started me on lithium so."
214.0,Provider,I lithium.
14206.0,Patient,I don't know. Because I was having maybe because I was having all these breakdowns are. Because I was in a low i'm not sure.
214.0,Provider,Are you getting any medications from us yeah.
14206.0,Patient,seroquel and lit now lithium. And cymbalta.
214.0,Provider,She say anything about blood tests with the lithium.
14206.0,Patient,know.
214.0,Provider,We just heard about because that's it's a it's not that you shouldn't be on it it's just that's a you that there needs to be a very much monitored. blood test for that.
14206.0,Patient,I agree.
214.0,Provider,We just want to make sure your care we don't want to make things worse. So Sharon gave it to you.
14206.0,Patient,Sure yeah.
214.0,Provider,Have you been before. Has it helped.
14206.0,Patient,You don't know I just started taking it yesterday so.
214.0,Provider,So when you use the word breakdown. What would be the definition of what you're going for.
14206.0,Patient,"Right um. So just i'm so irritable i'm annoyed i'm crying I just I can't stop crying I feel so low I feel hopeless I feel scared I feel. i'm. Like a failure, like I can't. Like i'm just a failure that I can't. function in that, so I have my new job starting on Monday, next Monday and it's like. I can't even I can't even function and."
214.0,Provider,When you say you can't function.
14206.0,Patient,Like my moods just. tank. Like they just tank and I get irritated and everything. absolutely everything and i'm. Just like a feeling of hopelessness and. it's just not great.
214.0,Provider,Okay okay okay fair enough it's a good explanation of breakdown. Does your environment have anything to do with that.
14206.0,Patient,"yeah I mean possibly my brother like. starts the way it feels like he starts the arguments like he jokes about something and then, when he made fun of my teeth, the other day, then. That started an argument."
214.0,Provider,With your teeth.
14206.0,Patient,"He has like no to send the front. Oh he's just. making fun of he, like makes fun of my teeth, because I feel like he's insecure about his teeth."
214.0,Provider,he's projecting he's upset about something so he's gonna deflect and now put you in the middle of the focus.
14206.0,Patient,yeah so it's like.
214.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, I get it, I get it, but but here's my thought. Not that it can be done. Do we need to entertain these things that actually spiral you and put you into breakdown mode."
14206.0,Patient,"yeah. I know cuz each time it's been an argument with my brother. and He just knows like what buttons to push and he's gone and he doesn't care he's very like he doesn't care how something affects me. He. really like he's selfish. Police seems like it. Like especially real right now, like what with what i'm going through. Like he put on this movie for like a serial killer thing and like he loves that stuff and I just like any little thing is just. Really i'm very sensitive to it. And so, he wouldn't change it, so I just thing is, we have air conditioner in the living room, and so I just sat in the hot room because I didn't want to be around it. So. yeah he went."
214.0,Provider,"So I mean you, you have. established that your environment is."
14206.0,Patient,and
214.0,Provider,Not much we can do about that that's that's the dilemma and.
14206.0,Patient,yeah i'm living at home just can.
214.0,Provider,Do you think that this great job about caring for kids and providing them unconditional love. will be some nourishment. That you don't and you won't be home as often and you won't have to deal with. The toxicity that he.
14206.0,Patient,"really want it to be. I. I just I feel like. How can I take care of others when I can't even take care of myself right now I have anxiety of are going outside of anxiety or being alone out in the world, because someone's going to. Follow me or hurt me or. But I push through it, I push through it like I every time I do go outside I just push through it and ignore like the anxiety about it so like acting opposite to. um."
214.0,Provider,When you say ignore the way you validating then nothing did happen.
14206.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"So one of the things about anxiety or. I don't want to give it a name but. What you're going through the way the try to. kind of combat that and reboot the brain. is whether you get to a place where you come home, you need to save yourself nothing happened, I am safe. So when you brainstorm telling you there's a potential, you need to reinforce to the brain, there is no potential. During your playing. you're subconsciously playing with me, which is fine, I am now going to take action and tell you, and remind you that nothing happens because as long as. See the brain is just a free moving thing it's an Oregon that has its own path like there's no controlling it right, but it does feed off of. The impending thoughts or the potential thoughts and people get really deflated by it, but the only way to combat that. is to say, you know I am safe like when people are afraid of water and eventually go into what in their waist and it's like are you safe at first, the answers really know. What the answer really is yes. Because you can't drown waist high water, but you feel like it's possible. But those moments of just reflecting positive to say yeah yeah I can't let you do this anymore or come back home and do an affirmation. I am loved I am wonderful, I want to provide unconditional love you know, maybe, maybe, maybe your frustration with your brother is more about trying to figure out why he is what he is and. i'm not sure that's that there's an answer, but maybe it's like I feel sorry my brother is toxic, I feel, showing my brother's angry i'm feel sorry my brother. wants to take it out on me like maybe part of of of that is just having gratitude not acceptance, because you don't need to accept that from anybody, but having a gratitude, where you know he doesn't have a front tooth you do. yeah sounds simple but, like a lot of those things start to build a nice Armor and and certain things that will say won't be so offensive right because you're ginger to communication."
14206.0,Patient,that's true I. had something I was going to say and I can't remember um. I think so like he'll like make jokes and he's like you can't even take a joke and somebody says like. You like they're just jokes and it's like. I know i'm not crazy like you're being a Dick.
214.0,Provider,"But here's the thing. When we reveal our Achilles heel people won't let it go. it's almost as if we given them. You know, an ask the station towards you know, this is my weakest link feel free to use it anytime I know you didn't. But in his mind. Right, this is his his birthright. It may not be you to stop it doesn't seem the mom can stop me and doesn't see. me stop it, but. I you know when it comes to stuff like that. I, I would say, it would be difficult is try to shut up shut him down as early as possible. Like Thank you."
14206.0,Patient,i've said I do that.
214.0,Provider,"I say that, once he said what's he say like what do you stop it, you can't give me you can't tell me it's funny."
14206.0,Patient,"yeah pretty much and like like, why do you just say thank you, thank he just continues the."
214.0,Provider,conversation any piece of information he utilizes.
14206.0,Patient,ravenous like he. will continue and continue and he's relentless. Like absolutely relentless.
214.0,Provider,So we realized that he's very hollow right.
14206.0,Patient,That he simply makes me crazy because. Because I started to question myself.
214.0,Provider,"nothing wrong with him, I actually you're you're spot on you don't you don't have to we don't have to go to the Supreme Court to validate that your feelings about the way he's acting is just obscene irresponsible Apps it's just absent, have any empathy and once a year, you know you can. write, whether you can hear. The word pancake and makes you cry he shouldn't be using it, but he will do the opposite, he is Mr opposite right opposite day and I think that the idea here is. You know I don't I don't know how to combat them, I mean if you can't turn them off like thank you, or whatever, and then he he'll just he. grows up. yeah but i'm wondering at being at work if that's not going to be like really helpful because you got to get ready for it, you gotta leave for work you got to get to work. You got to put in eight hours so maybe you'll be away from home 910 hours and that won't be so much The only problem is, will you be more vulnerable because you're tired."
14206.0,Patient,"yeah i'm i'm so scared because. I saw my psychiatrists mentioned that I should probably she like mentioned that I should go to like an outpatient honestly. And that I should tell my work that personal, I have a personal matter that's come up. it's just this is hard, because I don't know."
214.0,Provider,I wouldn't suggest on.
14206.0,Patient,know.
214.0,Provider,"I would know because you feel like you're already in that position where you feel you don't make a difference that you don't have the possibility to have a positive impact that's how deflated you are. I think working give you. That that re energizing I think what you may want to consider and again Sharon is not off with that recommendation I think what she's saying is you probably need to see somebody more often than less often. yeah right because you know we plug in for 15 minutes 20 minutes you get energized you feel okay i'm not so bad. But then, you know as the day goes on the week's go on, we start to deplete and then we get on empty and it's like oh crap what do I do with that so maybe the idea here again it's just a suggestion, every time I see you, I think. You you shake towards. That, I know I know and it's truly wrong what's happening to me and it's not me thinking that there's something wrong me that's what I think happens when you see me I just don't know how long that lasts."
14206.0,Patient,"that's exactly exactly and then it turns into an argument and then it. And then I suddenly I feel like i'm crazy and my mom can't do shit she doesn't do shit in fact she's scared of him, she just goes on his side anyways pretty much."
214.0,Provider,He gets like the whole thing right he makes you feel like maybe you should be in a straitjacket that's probably how he's done he.
14206.0,Patient,always done that. yeah he brings up old things and. He brings up old shit and. he's really arguing.
214.0,Provider,"that's all he's got. yeah I mean he's he's definitely not going to win the pulitzer prize or gold medal for it right there's nothing there's nothing of value for being relentless. As a non empathetic human being, you can close a lot of having that that we know, but you can be really useful, and the reason why you're the way you are. Is because of the way you feel inside not that i'm suggesting you have that discussion with him, but he has zero value so his value is to upset everybody else around them."
14206.0,Patient,it's true it's true.
214.0,Provider,If I can't if I can't have my bucket in your sandbox and you're saying socks it's really contaminated it's a terrible thing i'm going to find somebody else with better saying he just goes on and on.
14206.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So I think the way to combat you could always tell work you have an issue you don't need to do that on the onset you should see of work. is part of a solution it's an ancillary positive reflection that you are valued, you are loved you are deserving you can provide the world what it needs, which is unconditional love. to other children who need it, I think that that is a way to turn the negative energy into positive energy and maybe that'll make you stronger every day and just being added a House more is definitely. going to be beneficial, on top of that it'll come back your anxiety that you're going through, because those kids are gonna make you forget about everything in home."
14206.0,Patient,yeah that's.
214.0,Provider,"actually going to be. fantasy but you're not this associating in your own mind fantasy you're actually having a visual touch communication where you're taking yourself out of one bed world. And in and bringing your love to another world I don't think that's bad I think that's really good. I think it's too early to say we can't do anything, because I think we're playing right into the cards, and I would have, I think that could be more detrimental and we don't want to that we've just started medication that should neutralize that hopelessness."
14206.0,Patient,"And that's what i'm scared about is that changing my medication and I was scared to take lithium I was scared to take it yesterday, because I know that there are side effects, I know that there's."
214.0,Provider,"No side effects for all of them, to be honest, I mean i'm even tylenol after, why has a serious side effects if taken in large doses, but, but sometimes. We have to figure out what it to a test kit what what what needs to be repaired so imagine this, I believe that the lithium. So it's Tuesday, probably by Friday and Saturday you'll feel much different so we'll know there's a repair there and then we'll say okay. So, in the interim, of the lithium helping repair what is some of the other things, you need to incorporate to do more, repair and before you know it will repair the whole hard drive and maybe we can get all for lithium. The problem is your environment, you know I mean you know it's it's just toxic, but you don't have the finances to move out that becomes more stressful when you think about it mom not wanting to do anything it just continues it's a it's really a snowball."
14206.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So then give the love you have to someone else if the two people who you live with can appreciate and value you then give all you can to someone else, because that will bring life into you and I think it's a really important thing. So what time do you work on Monday."
14206.0,Patient,"um well I think so it's all right now it's virtual it's like 830 to 12 but um I told her I can't do. Monday and Wednesday is because of class within my class that cancelled and then, but all my homework is due on Tuesdays, so I think I was just going to keep along with like not having work on Mondays and Wednesdays it's part time work."
214.0,Provider,"Whatever it work is work if even in part time of weekend it's really about passion and and finding another outlet, this is what you need you need another outlet, I really think. This is a positive thing, what i'm thinking is, how can we sneak in to see each other for a check in to say where we at. Where is our risks were our rewards what have we seen benefits, what have we seen right, because we know what we can change we can change him we can't change mom but that just resolve to that that's we can't do anything about those, but what we can do is how we feel about us. And I think if I can keep you motivated and keep you moving forward, I think you'll be the benefit of it, so I don't know what day would work. for you to see me next week."
14206.0,Patient,early in the morning on Monday.
214.0,Provider,"So we're looking at that that when you say early in the morning, what are you looking at like 11 like 8am. Seven, so I can do, seven."
14206.0,Patient,"Okay, I and i'm sorry I missed yesterday but lines."
214.0,Provider,"with like. It this is life on life's terms. If if this becomes like a mandatory and we start off at the gate with the you know you missed an appointment and does not, this is not the way I operate. You have to get into a comfortability flow and then, once you see benefit. I think it'll be easier to do right, then the answer we don't know what benefits are so why should I be committed and whatever the reason is, it is, and I don't have a problem with it, but this Monday i'll put you down for 7am and then we're going to decide on Monday, whether or not. It isn't worth CME once a week. Because I think six days alone is long, but 13 days alone is even longer. yeah right."
14206.0,Patient,"I. I don't know I just feel. Really scared I feel really, really scared and I don't have a car, yet like i'm supposed to like I was going to get a car soon and. Like because my friend is selling it and I wouldn't even have to get financing, I could just pay her payments every month, on my own time and. there's just a lot of things that are out of my control, right now, because for the job I need the car and I haven't gotten the car yet. And then I need to gather all this stuff for the for the job i'm like I need to go, I need to get a flu shot like there's just like all these different things. are overwhelmed."
214.0,Provider,"You are overwhelmed but there, there are things that you can do like the flu shot, you can do the car is finances with the you can come to terms, in agreement with your friend about the finances. chances are you can do so, you know overwhelmed means I just I can't I can't put. Three more rocks in a one pound bag because it's going to make it upon the half the bag is going to rip that's overwhelmed. So just be careful when you're saying things because what it looks like on the onset when we say it, it looks like I don't think I can I don't think I can maintain this and get all these things done."
14206.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"And I feel you I empathize with you, I support you I validate you, but what I know is some of these things aren't overwhelmed they feel it, but we can do them and every time we take one off the plate. Right one off the plate than the play becomes clear, but when we look at the plate in its entirety, it looks like it's all falling over and we'll never going to get to a clear play I get that here's the problem with Monday, you have to go to group on Monday."
14206.0,Patient,Already.
214.0,Provider,"So you cannot see me on Mondays because we can't have two at the same time, what would be another alternate day."
14206.0,Patient,"i'm. Anything this week, like Friday, or something. or Tuesday."
214.0,Provider,So. I have. Tuesday at seven o'clock.
14206.0,Patient,"Okay, we could do that."
214.0,Provider,"i'd so let me just change this. And that's pretty good because you'll have a process group. And then you'll see me so, then, the reality is you're really alone, five days not six days, because you have a group, then you have me. And then, what will determine is on Tuesday, whether or not. We should go to once a week and we can be more flexible with the days and times I don't care about that, but i'm just thinking like who are you going to vent to who you're going to bring some of your your. Unresolved things to like you got to hold them that's just a lot and that overwhelmed this or. You know hopelessness that's what that's about having to carry too much, and no one to share with, and I think the more you can share, which is meaning expelling it. I think you'll feel, but I really do I really think by next week, this won't be present, and if it is we'll figure out another plan. But you know we don't have to be haste and we don't have to be overwhelmed we can we can manage everything. And if you ever need me I just finally you know, so you could always call the. Virtual clinic and say you know I I work with manny I need to see him, they will contact me right away and we'll figure something out that day you'll never go. Without not seeing me so you should always know if you feel overwhelmed or you feel like you're in crisis, you should definitely reach out and i'll get on right, because I think the more you think. i'm reliable, the more becomes a relationship where you know we're 5050 in it versus I don't want to test what and figure out another person will be there for me right, because that may be some of. The feelings that you have like I don't I don't want to start something, because I know how things and and I don't want them to end that way, so I won't start them and i'm trying to tell you, you can start them and never feel. scared that you'll never see me, and that includes on weekends you just never have to worry okay so we're on for Tuesday, let me get that in now. I just suicide any suicidal ideations. yeah how bad."
14206.0,Patient,"Sorry, I felt like I could cut myself i'd be better off and. Like. I don't know what i'm going to start work, I know you will i'm not even I, I am not sweating then i'm going to tell you why."
214.0,Provider,"I would change the switch to see what will I give to them instead of instead of thinking you have nothing to offer start thinking about what you do have to offer because of your situation you can provide someone else something more than they're getting. By it's like the guy with no shoes and say I got no shoes and then we say what about the guy with no feet like you're in a bad situation, we know that i'm not going to sugarcoat that but. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, that if we can get this going, and we can put our energy over here this negative energy won't even impact us and I really think that's going to be the launch feel. Alright, so just go slow."
14206.0,Patient,Center call work and say I need to. Know okay.
214.0,Provider,"I think you will totally. For lack of better words, you will build your own prison i'm not sure i'll find the key. that's, the only thing that's kinda. Guy you talking about future that's, the only thing like when I say unconditional love to the kids those are the only things that set off some sparks if we take that away what would we have."
14206.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,And I think it's just getting out more just be healthier for you.
14206.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"And that could always change, you can always say you know many I thought about and I can do it i'll support you validate you, but I think we need to look at. Does a bigger benefit by going to work, then there isn't by going to work and, since you started taking the medication, you should see a turnaround by Friday Saturday, if not earlier but it usually takes a couple of days."
14206.0,Patient,I also think about how I don't fit into any of my business professional clothes and more I have gained way and that's another thing that bothers me and eating bothers me I feel guilty after he feel.
214.0,Provider,But you know what the evenings about.
14206.0,Patient,You like unless i'm asleep.
214.0,Provider,"But you're not a mess I, and I don't have to tell you, things that are alive that's just not a good way for therapists to be with a person if I thought you were in a big disarray, I would say okay when is the last time we showered when's the last time we took a look at what we're doing. But I would be I would be that blunt with it, but I know that you're battling but instead of using the two crutches to think about you know, every time I take that first step there's a lot of pain. But that means you have to be on the coaches all the time it's better to start letting go one coach now adjusting to some of the pain and getting stronger than it is to rely on these two coaches and my concern relying on it to coaches isn't healthy feel. And that can change, and please validate and support you don't think I want to have this thing about well, you should I just think you need to look at the bigger picture, which is others. You need to provide something for someone else that can be provided to you, but remember that's reciprocal. Providing something to somebody else means you're going to receive something from somebody else and what better thing to receive from a stranger than a thank you, or you wonderful i'm glad you're here. Like what a better gift if we can get it from people that are blood relatives, then what better gift than to get it from a stranger who just sees me for me and the evening is about control. Your your batting of control you can't control nothing in the House, but you should help control the eating. yeah it is, and I I get it, but I think if you get out more. weight gain weight loss, change your clothes, all these things we can adjust to, but if we can get the mental health. In a manageable place these things will manifest manifest even worse, so the eating of get more out of control. hopelessness will get bigger and before you know it it's it's a big big avalanche and that's what i'm trying to prevent, so I think if we stay for this listen, we could always regroup next week, but I think if we stay with this plan, I think we'll see a benefit. alrighty and if you need me just call the virtual clinic. Alright, so group taking medication see you Tuesday. Okay, all right take care. bye bye."
