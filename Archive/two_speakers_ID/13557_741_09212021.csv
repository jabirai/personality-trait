741.0,Provider,"I understand I understand completely and I apologize, I was like. I said a lot of people don't show up. And so I sometimes I sit around here. Waiting for people to show up. And I just haven't looked at the mandate, because they were doing some."
13557.0,Patient,"I actually appreciate the text because I forget, so I have major memory issues. Like right and so and I told them that i'm like look, you need to. You need to text me need to be on me like if there's something I need to do, you need to be text me every day, like every hour, you need to be annoying me i'm okay with that because I need that right so like.

I mean, I know it's on me, too, but at the same time, like I made them well aware, before I ever joined the program that you know I said look I have major in memory issues, this could be a problem with compliance like. Right my life. Like you, you know they were like well that's okay we're gonna text you we're gonna let you know all the time, so like you. don't you don't have to worry like it's gonna we're gonna text you and I was like to the point of annoying because, like I need that they're like yeah, to the point of annoyance and like okay great, then the moment they made for good. not happening because most of the time i'm not getting text. Later till after something has happened right either forgotten an appointment, like last week I didn't get a text at all until and it was only when I realized Thursday came around and I looked at my calendar, and I was like wait today supposed to be. The appointment, where is that on my calendar and then I realized, oh no I missed it like. I never got to start anything that said hey Mister. And i'm not saying that on you like it's just you know they stole me they would and same thing with. filling out paperwork, or you know these these things they want to know it's like well. You know, you need to bother me and not just one time, like one time yeah but if I look at my phone and then I look away, I may have forgotten that I got a text in that few seconds that's just the reality so. Right, unfortunately, I have cats here so like that. I can be like okay i'm gonna go do this and then like my cattle come up and like you know bump me and try to be like, no, no, I got to mega what was I supposed to again like you know. Then one time and that's why I told them that you know you got annoyed me and like. i'm okay with that and, like a mad you know, like. I want that from you know."
741.0,Provider,Okay well.
13557.0,Patient,"For the treatment or not, the treatment plan, but I was asked you what's in my. file, I guess, if they're stuck."
741.0,Provider,"The treatment lands, this is your treatment plan that I came up with. And we're going to go over that. And then you can tell me what you like and what you don't like and what you're willing to do and what you're not willing to do. Okay, and then we can make changes okay. And this just says that you have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety and insomnia, and chronic pain."
13557.0,Patient,yeah i'm sorry.
741.0,Provider,"lesson Okay, and not your fault we've got all that stuff. It really is not any fun."
13557.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"But then, basically, the presenting problem that I put forth is that you know you patient constantly worried about health and reporting symptoms of hyper vigilance your. And you feel sad most days of the week and experience helplessness hopelessness and worthlessness and you use addictive medications to control the pain and complain of generalized pain on joints and muscles and bones with decreasing activities do the pain."
13557.0,Patient,"Did you put the complex ptsd in there, I mean I don't know it's."
741.0,Provider,"um I did not put in a ptsd and I don't believe I even. I may have, but I mean no I don't think I did. um, but I think that in."
13557.0,Patient,"yeah I think that plays a big part in my memory and memory effects and my thinking and disorientation and confusion, all that plays a huge role and depression and. It affects your life in so many ways that it's hard to even explain to people that don't have it like they they just people just don't get it a lot of times but it affects everything. yeah I mean it affects everything in your life, you have to manage everything around it. And it's exhausting. it's exhausting so. All in there, especially with social security, like, I had to fight for my social security benefits for almost seven years and. I just recently got them and I don't know how that's going to go in the future with. I mean I don't know I just wanna make sure everything's in there, so that they can't come back and be like well you know yeah you had complex ptsd then now this new place that you're at they they don't have any record of that like."
741.0,Provider,"Now i'm sure that it's in there as just not one of the ones that I grabbed to treatment plan, because the a lot of the other things are also involved in that same. The goals are going to be similar. form of that I didn't go in and do that if you would like."
13557.0,Patient,Like I said yeah i'm just more worried about I don't really I mean i'm not worried about like for you and me i'm more worried about social security in the future. they've been so petty about little.
741.0,Provider,I now.
13557.0,Patient,"use it against me and. I mean, it has been literally like they I think they caused a lot of ptsd it's been literal hell from them so like."
741.0,Provider,"Oh, I believe it."
13557.0,Patient,"want to kind of cut that off before. If they come back in the future and they're like hey you know we went to go check up on you and, like you're you know, seeing a therapist, and this is, I just want to make sure that it's all there, so they can't be like well you know."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
13557.0,Patient,mean. If it's possible just.
741.0,Provider,hmm.
13557.0,Patient,"And you always do it now like you can do it later it's not a big deal, or if it's too much, I mean I don't know how your thing work so."
741.0,Provider,i'm. Just me. move. huh. That was you. Come on.
13557.0,Patient,guys have all kinds of stuff I didn't.
741.0,Provider,"Oh yeah No, this is like. They don't even have it down. that's what's got me good."
13557.0,Patient,"Well yeah that because honestly that's one of the things that I think finally. When I got diagnosed with that was one of the things that help with social security pushing things through was they finally had an you know and it helped me to realize like Oh well, this they're actually explains a lot, you know, like. Right, you know. Depression it wasn't just like that you know that."
741.0,Provider,Depression is going to.
13557.0,Patient,"cause the extreme memory issues that I have read and. Some of the other issues it's like whoa I never could kind of scare them away, and neither could anybody else because they're like well Okay, they sound, this could be physical, but it could be mental but we don't really have like your diagnosis doesn't. fit right, so you know, finally, when they did the complex ptsd it was like oh Okay, and I think that I just want to make sure it's all there that's really all."
741.0,Provider,"Just singing. I am. Because. Okay, but what's the number. find that the code for it that's why. OK now go back huh I can get that little thing to stop coming down on me. there. No. Okay. So we have here. Well, number one is to learn to relax and think accurately and logically about events and learn coping strategies to decrease the effects of the anxiety. And the way we're going to do that as we're going to learn and implement common techniques, reduce overall anxiety and symptoms. And soon didactic education some homework assignment and some cognitive behavior therapy. and develop leisure program that will increase the frequency of pleasurable activities and help others regularly. And, and that these are the other techniques. That i'm going to utilize in therapy that's all the the intervention part is. and decrease just functional thinking and increase positive self enhancing self talk. and Practice some exercises and Hello Diana, yes, I know. i'm busy i'm sure you heard him."
13557.0,Patient,I have another thing.
741.0,Provider,"And so, then we're going to learn and use behavioral strategies to overcome depression. And there'll be some i'm having a little a few little like homework assignment type things. they'll just worksheets to get you to think about stuff. And now we're going to learn and implement some effective decision making skills. and develop healthy options to deal with pain. And that's basically what i've put together."
13557.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,sounds good.
13557.0,Patient,"yeah that sounds good, the only thing is the homework is man may or may not happen. Again we'll see if the memory has."
741.0,Provider,"Well we'll try it, you know I mean, I understand that that um you may not remember everything um but we'll see what we can do okay."
13557.0,Patient,"I just want you to be aware, like I. I just want you to know that I can't promise, something that. Other than trying to."
741.0,Provider,"understand. And then my plan as for us to go over this and reevaluate where we stand. With the treatment plan at the end of December or before the end of December. Okay yeah and then we are one to have. swing week to be. Well, maybe. So i'm gonna sign this. kinda is it's a kind of sending it and and then. And if you agree to it, then i'll type your name in here."
13557.0,Patient,yeah I agree that's fine. Were you able to put in the complex ptsd thing I just.
741.0,Provider,say that yes.
13557.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,"All right, then what i'm going to be as i'm gonna save it and exit and then I am gonna say I can do you want a copy of it."
13557.0,Patient,"No, I don't need a copy, I just want to make sure if there's anything I just kind of wanted to know from my I guess file they told us and the weekly thing we do tomorrow. The. The guy who prescribes I can't remember his name, he prescribes the."
741.0,Provider,medication medication right.
13557.0,Patient,"We have like a weekly group they said, to ask about your file and. see if you know you have anything any issues in there right that you need to be doing or that you're not doing or they you know."
741.0,Provider,I see what you. yeah.
13557.0,Patient,What i'm doing.
741.0,Provider,"Right right. Okay um. Yes, Okay, you have some surveys."
13557.0,Patient,yeah i'm care.
741.0,Provider,needs to be done you've got like 1234 surveys that needs to be done there overdue.
13557.0,Patient,"All right, I will try to work on that."
741.0,Provider,"Okay um. yeah there's four of them I can give you the names of them, if you want."
13557.0,Patient,um no I I where i'm not really sure i'll find those but once I find them i'm sure it'll be fine.
741.0,Provider,"What you do is you call that the virtual the vc that that clinic. Okay, and they can they can give them to you or send them to you in your email. for fun."
13557.0,Patient,"Okay, all right, I will work on that."
741.0,Provider,"Okay okay. All right, so. And last time we talked. I think we were you were going out. and try to put together a list of things that you might enjoy doing that you feel like you could do."
13557.0,Patient,"Okay now yeah i've been thinking about that. um well, I think I could do ceramics so. You know if I can do it with my caregiver where she does all the cleanup."
741.0,Provider,Right.
13557.0,Patient,"And you know I could probably do some kind of ceramics I have. I have this throwing wheel that it's still in the box like I haven't even opened it up or put it together and everything because. I just know haven't really. yeah so I could probably do that. You know I i've been thinking that i'd like for a while i've been thinking i'd like to join some kind of women's group. or some I don't know of course co bid I don't I don't know like i'm torn on that because. The Colbert I I don't want to end up getting sick or something you know, like it is kind of, especially with me it's dangerous with my. from being immune compromised so like I don't know but part of me is also like well you know, this could go on for a very long time, if it goes on for 30 years they just never gonna go. right to do you know, like so. I you know I don't I don't know i'm torn on that one so."
741.0,Provider,Trying one online. Trying to join a women's Community online that meets online online regularly um.
13557.0,Patient,"yeah i've got kind of a kind of that i've got a support group it's like a it's all strangers, but yeah it's you know, an anonymous support group online. is good but yeah I could do something like there's not a schedule it's just kind of everyday they you know, everybody goes in there and and talks about different things so like so uh. But yeah I could do like a scheduled thing to wear probably find something else that. You know that might yeah that might be good I hadn't thought to do that that's a good idea."
741.0,Provider,"Well, you still need the support group. um but my suggestion is that if you find somebody in that support group that that you kind of click with or some reach out to them in the chat and and try to make a connection with them. Well it's not easy to do but."
13557.0,Patient,"Well, more of a safety issue, because it is like it's up on the Internet, where anybody can see it like that, you know, yes, only women can join, but anybody can see anything in there and so and basically they don't cater to men right and there's a lot of men that hate that group and. You know, like talk about how they want death threats and like so it would be dangerous and they always tell us you know don't if somebody reaches out to you and pretend, you know you don't know if they're really a woman or not so like be careful not to divulge janine. And so, like that in that particular group I think it's dangerous, but you know I hadn't finding one that's maybe a more close to where. You know they not just everybody can see it and it's much smaller because, like that's like a couple of hundred thousand people in that one so like women and so."
741.0,Provider,Right yeah.
13557.0,Patient,"Something smaller where you know there's like you know 20 my that actually might be a good idea, you know where. It can be in and nobody can just see whatever you're saying and yeah that's that's a good idea."
741.0,Provider,not something that meets like in the zoom. Type atmosphere.
13557.0,Patient,"yeah I hadn't thought about that, but that's that might be good idea yeah you know."
741.0,Provider,"Because at this point, yes, you want to protect yourself against catching colby."
13557.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"But at the same time we can't continue to isolate because coverage probably not going to go away. yeah so we're going to have to learn alternative methods for connecting with people. So this is kind of like just to start. To try to get. make some personal connections with people and where you can talk to them, and you can see them. But you're not in the same room yeah."
13557.0,Patient,So do that.
741.0,Provider,And they have all kinds of different groups for like women who are in the ceramics and and people who are into cat soon um.
13557.0,Patient,Where do you look at stuff like just through zoom like zoom groups like.
741.0,Provider,"You can look on on on even on Google or or Facebook, or any of those types places that that you can find no specific groups and. There is also linkedin, which is a professional one that i'm that I use."
13557.0,Patient,I will yeah.
741.0,Provider,So it's just. better than sitting in isolation. yeah and you can find groups that have similar you know groups of people who have similar interests that you have.
13557.0,Patient,"yeah that's a good idea, I mean i'm not totally isolated but. You know I could be, I think I need to think of the future, because you know, like me and my mom have you know a great friendship and you know but she's not gonna be around forever and you know she's getting older and. You know me and my caregiver get along, but again she's my caregiver she's played that you know paid to be here so that's. uh huh like you can like somebody and be friends with them, but they're still ultimately it's still a job you know so like. Right and I do have like a friend in port Angeles, but again she's in port Angeles that's several hours away and. You know that that's kind of you know i'm not completely isolated, but I need to branch out, I know that."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
13557.0,Patient,yeah cuz.
741.0,Provider,"I mean you do have connections, but they're they're smaller number, and if something were to happen that even two of them."
13557.0,Patient,Exactly yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Then you know you're even more isolated. yeah so. um it's really, really important to try to make those connections. And, and the other part of it is to be willing to be vulnerable with those people once you develop a relationship with them so that they know what's really going on, you know. And that's kind of scary for people who you know, for those of us who don't have a whole lot of associations, you know being vulnerable with other people isn't something that we do real low."
13557.0,Patient,"yeah i've kind of realized i'm a self sabotage definitely it was. You know you test, people are used to like I don't I try not to anymore, and I tried to change to make sure I change that behavior but yeah in the past, I definitely think I ruined good things because. You know I didn't have self worth and then. I know you just self sabotage right."
741.0,Provider,"Right right because, deep down inside you feel like you don't deserve to have people in your life yeah."
13557.0,Patient,And you know and also when you have an asshole has ex husband abusing me.
741.0,Provider,kind of I want.
13557.0,Patient,People to hurt people right like that's.
741.0,Provider,"hurt people hurt people, yes, they do. and I don't necessarily if that doesn't make it Okay, but that's what happens, we do it without without realizing it a lot of times."
13557.0,Patient,"yeah exactly, and you know, like i'm it's been. Passed him but yeah, the reality is is that going out and then."
741.0,Provider,lasting effects.
13557.0,Patient,yeah you know.
741.0,Provider,"You know, using the past, you still have he gave years and fears revolving around that past expand."
13557.0,Patient,yeah no.
741.0,Provider,I still have a lot of baggage we carry baggage with us from. From the back when in our life.
13557.0,Patient,"that's the truth. So yeah and so making even though I am definitely a different person than I was before like this new person doesn't that's true I don't have a whole lot of friends and like making new friends, is probably is a little bit scary you know, and I like to i'm becoming but. You know, there is a reality that others don't and I know that, like they you know I am not a doormat like I used to be i'm not i'm not willing to just be like, yes, you can do whatever you want me it is fine, I have no boundaries at all like no but you know. And people there's a lot of people that don't like your own boundaries, because they benefit from you, not having any so like. i'm just not that person anymore and i'm outspoken much more and I just don't put up with things that I might have in the past and I sometimes probably do go a little too hard, the other side because I don't want to be, you know. misused, and so I get extra harsh when maybe I you know, a softer approach could have been better."
741.0,Provider,yeah sometimes when we don't have. boundaries when we learn to make them we make them very. Like very protective and very rigid. And and there's no permeability to them so that's because we're trying to protect yourselves. So we have to find a way to kind of soften those So what are some of your boundaries.
13557.0,Patient,"Oh. Well um. you're not going to get credit for doing basic human decency, I mean you know I if I cannot scream at you, you don't get to scream at me and. Then or make me feel bad about you know, like well you know I get credit cuz I didn't scream at least I didn't scream at you, you know I didn't hit you like. Well yeah but you shouldn't have been doing on the first place right like I don't want to get you shouldn't get a participant I shouldn't be like oh you're amazing Let me give you an award for you know being basically decent. You know and."
741.0,Provider,So verbal abuse. and any type any type of abuse.
13557.0,Patient,yeah i'm just not.
741.0,Provider,is not acceptable.
13557.0,Patient,"yeah and I can now see like mental and emotional and narcissistic abuse much more easily and red flags, now that in the past, I. would have just well you know they didn't mean that they were sorry they. You know i'm sure they didn't mean it that way, oh, they did that to somebody else that's not me, I mean they never do that to me right, like you know that no i'm not that special to wear like. know if they'll do it to somebody else to do it to me if they didn't they're not even apologizing, so why are you apologizing for them, you know, like. flag and you can't just ignore it, you know. right that that that tiny little red flag now. You know, may seem like nothing but then in 510 years you know now it's a sword your life so. No."
741.0,Provider,"You see i'm doing it to someone else probably means they'll do it, you somewhere down the road."
13557.0,Patient,"yeah like you know if you go out with somebody and they treat the waiter terribly. they're probably going to do that to you at some point, you know and there's no reason to do that, you know, even if. Things aren't working out and you know we've all had bad service will have that but. You know, you can still have compassion and be like well you know that person you don't know what happened, maybe they had a death in the family or. You know they're exhausted or they're in pain or they're pregnant or whatever you know, like a little bit of compassion of Okay, you know I don't need to."
741.0,Provider,know your story I don't know why you're being how you're being but. This is how you're you know.
13557.0,Patient,"You can still be polite. hey i'm not gonna come back here i'm gonna go elsewhere, I you know, like my money back or whatever like. Right. it's just you know I guess respect that you know don't expect me to respect you or you if you don't respect me and basic equality to like I am not going to cook clean for you, you know do all these things that. All women are most women are expected to do and you'd be like well I worked all day and i'm tired and like well you know, I was working all day. I mean, before I got sick, you know, and yet i'm still expect to do all these extra things like no I read a study somewhere that said that. Basically, even the best of men, even, especially in America like only do about 30% of the emotional physical Labor that women are doing so, women are doing 70% the very best the men are doing 30 at most so. That that's not funny well that's not okay so like. No, I am never know you know you're gonna interact like. I kind of believe that it's i've gotten, to the point where I guess it depends on the dynamics like you know if you're in trying to be in a relationship with somebody, then you know, like a significant other versus a friend. Right, where it's going to be at least equal you know, and if you especially with between a man and a woman it's not equal, women are biologically not. i'm going to expect you to make up for that and other ways that's just a you know we're not socially equal we're not even economically equal yeah so like. Until the world changes and we actually are like you need to be put i'm not going to be cheap I should not be the one put in 70% if anything that should be you and I should be 30%. Never doing that so like I just kind of realized that that. I think it starts out small but little things of Oh, you know, like expect you know somebody to do all these things, for me, oh like you need to do the one i'm just not capable of it like if I was capable of taking care of myself I wouldn't need a caregiver right. A lot of things. And what I can give is going to be different than you know. With within my capabilities, like you know somebody else can show me that they care, through their actions. You know, like my she's not a big. voice person she's she doesn't say, well, I really appreciate all but she shows me that she cares about me through her actions and she goes above and beyond, she does extra stuff she's you know she's always. And I can't necessarily replicate that but I do tell her all the time, you know you're amazing you're great I don't know what I do with that what you like you're the best caregiver ever you know thinking, I mean it, you know, like she. I you know we talked about that, or at least I do for sure. And she's told me before that you know I may not always say it back, but I really do appreciate that you sell it and i'm like yeah because I can't show you the same way that you show me, but I can show you in other ways, you know I could say it and. Maybe you're a person that can say it that's okay. i'm not expecting you to say anything back it's no big deal. Okay well expressed, you know carrying in different ways, so. You know, but that's just kind of expected so it's like."
741.0,Provider,For a.
13557.0,Patient,"Night no, I think that some people. Sometimes just. They just expect more of you than what you're capable of, and then they get mad when you're like no, I can only show you this way, and this is how it is. Pretty blunt and honest these days so like. I want to have good boundaries and because i'm not 100% they're like people that have great boundaries, they don't usually need to tell you, because you don't need to talk about it because they just have."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
13557.0,Patient,"i'm always talking about boundaries because i'm not there, so like i'm always talking about boundaries and i'm like this is it and I figure one it's good because it knows lets other people know where they stand and I like boundaries because. It lets me know where I stand, and let it tells me okay they've asked me not to do this it's not mean you know, but like it just let somebody know and so i'm always talking about. Like i'm just not there, where I just would automatically right. And so."
741.0,Provider,That works that works is it's. You can't know if you're crossing a boundary unless someone tells you yeah.
13557.0,Patient,"Exactly and so many of us have been trained to you know just from birth and that Nice girls don't have boundaries, and you know boundaries are mean, and you know how dare you say no, how dare you not put somebody else before you like you're selfish. Right."
741.0,Provider,That selfish word.
13557.0,Patient,"I mean Come on, you know. Every woman that i've ever met or known and even before I was sick like and I had friends before you know. They just went above and beyond, but they were never preached they were still told, no matter what you did you were still sold you're selfish. You know how dare you not put a man first How dare you not put everybody else before you even my mother like you know, but I realized, like you, you can't help anybody else if you don't save yourself first right like."

13557.0,Patient,"If you're drowning and your kid next to you or your friend is drowning and you're like wait I gotta save you while i'm trying to drown right. Instead, maybe say you know, save yourself get up get out of the drowning situation, and then you can pull that other person up and help them, but. it's not selfish to save yourself and you can't save others, and I think I always for a long time, even now, I think, sometimes I, I want to save others. You know, and like right that they don't necessarily want to save they're not at the same point that I am after a lot of therapy and, like my mom points that out to me looks like she's just. not there yet, you know and and you can't save somebody that doesn't want to be saved and like you're just pushing the you know I have like me and my sister. I don't know it's difficult but. she's like she's i'm like watching her kind of reliving my life, like the bad parts and. You know she recently hit her head she had her head like a month or two ago. She already had, I believe she already had brain damage from she'd had cheated or had a bunch of times had a really terrible fall when she was little and almost died. And I think she's had brain damage for Barrett like since she's been I don't know like to write I think she's had bring tears, for a long time, but I think it's been misinterpreted have. A lot of other thing you know oh she's just difficult to or you know she's on Ray or she just as I mean we all kind of really slow and like there's something going on it, she just off and so like. To come to that conclusion, but I think it was really hard for my mom to accept that and admit that. You know, and my dad to like you know your child actually might have brain damage and also my mom feels guilty about the. Because my sister fell down like this flight of stairs when she was little and her Walker and. or and learn a little like baby thing, and you know my mom had been watching us, but she just took two seconds to go the bathroom she shut the door. so that you know my little sister couldn't fall to the bathroom for two seconds she's like I didn't ever leave you guys I just needed two seconds ago I got up like right, you know. And I one of us open the door in that two seconds I don't know with nearby but I can't remember, but you know my sister fell in like there's concrete them, it was a huge fight it was terrible and. So she feels I think she stopped me to this day she feels. So good so guilty and like, then, you know now if she has brain damage from that On top of this, that she didn't really want to MIT to her right, you know, like you, don't want to just add, so I get that but anyway, my sister hit her head and. Now she is having double vision, and you know she's not thinking clearly at all she's really confused, more so than usual and memory and nausea and all these different you know. And now, and i'm pretty sure it's traumatic brain injury, you know because it only takes like what one or two concussion she's had over eight and nine, at this point, severe ones. yeah i'm pretty sure praying is like not you know it's not good like she's. But she also doesn't want to admit to it but either way you know, like so now she can't work, and you know I offered to help her kind of go through. trying to get you know some benefits she's in Colorado so i'm like hey you know, let me i've been through this you know social security system is hard it sucks it's miserable. And you know there's certainly you need like what they say and what they want and what they mean are two different things."
741.0,Provider,and writing.
13557.0,Patient,"Is a totally another thing you know you can be like well wait, it says, right here on your website and black and white that I need this this and this and that I, you know for these things like. It doesn't matter they'll come up with all kinds of shit like for me, they said somehow I faked an MRI an x Ray and a blood test. Because i'm the smartest person in the world, and I somehow also like convinced over 35 doctors at the Mayo clinic the most you know smartest people in the world right. And then i'm like. Sick when i'm not. yeah and they actually like said this shit which was just you know that's like awful but in traumatizing and it's so but somehow but i'm also like. say you know, like either you're the smartest spoken person that works I don't even know that that's not like when I asked us to do that because I didn't know that you could fake an MRI. I didn't know. Right and I didn't know you could fake blood like I didn't even know that was a possibility, so how you do that, well, we don't know, but you just did. Right so like it's just the misery there's so many there's some some back there, but another day maybe. I offered to kind of help her as best as I could you know, like which honestly does take away from my own. You know, being good to myself and, like my have my own illness, so I don't yet, but I was like no I mean her have a stress relationship, because I don't really remember her, but like. With my ex I guess my mom told me that I guess he came on to her and like was awful and I didn't know you know and like Of course I was being abused and so like my excuse, but I was yes, I was awful to I don't really know."
741.0,Provider,you're in your own world you're dealing with your own mess.
13557.0,Patient,"So you know, like that kind of separated us even further, and you know now. And now she's unfortunately she's married to what I realized is a manipulator and narcissistic abuser much like my next person grew up in the same home so i'm not really that surprised, you know, we have the same narcissistic dad. And you're you're trying to relive their partners a lot of times like you're trying to redo your most difficult parents over. control so i'm not really that's fine, but you know, like i'm just it's not making it an easier because her partner or doesn't want to. doesn't want to help doesn't want to help you know, like, I was like well okay there's a million things that to be done, you know, like you know we need you to. fill out paperwork and she's not capable, because she can't see and you know, like all these things right and i'm just in a. let's get the you know here's things need to be done i'll send you a list you know get this done mode and she liked twist the my she's with a transgendered woman so. But. You know she basically went you know, like she twisted everything that I sent her leg and I asked my heroes like was this the main message, because I just said, please Thank you hear things that need to be done. she's like she was means me and she was rude to me and she's like no i'm not going to help and like so I was like so wait your partner doesn't want to help you know she wants to help me, but I was like well. But she doesn't want to help because, like i'm like but she doesn't want to have any contact with you, and I even told her I said well you don't have to have any contact with me. i'll just send a list Ashton of what needs to be done, you do it, and then. You don't have any contact with me that's fine like no big deal and she's like yeah but she doesn't want that either and i'm like so she doesn't want to help. She basically just wants us to do all the work she wants us to help you to save you to get you social security and. What you know, like no like it, I don't know there's all these other things that she was doing that's just clearly very manipulative and like I I just seen that abuse and so i've been through it, so I know so like. i'm like Oh well. she's way being abused and manipulated and things that were coming out of my sister is not that she would say like she'd be okay, with one I talked to her to be like okay so. here's what needs to happen, are you okay with this, you know i'm trying to be more sensitive and be like Okay, are you truly okay with this is this, you want to do that yeah that's fine I do okay. And then, a few hours later, after she talked to her, you know wife, then she come back and be like you're manipulating me and you were trying to make me do this and i'm like no i'm not I was trying to i'm trying to help you. And it's been like a it's like everything is a constant fight, you know she's Okay, with it, then she turns around she's not because she's not been manipulated into. You know she comes back with your manipulative i'm like look I don't want to manipulate you I don't want you to think i'm going to be like i'm trying to I want to build our relationship to where you know we have. A better relationship, hopefully, or some kind of relationship and. Right, you know I, and I told her, I was like look if I if i'm trying to hurt you, the best thing I can do to hurt you is not offered to do shit I mean that that's just the reality. You know it's it's a lot of work cuz I sent her this list of things had to be done, just like that so much and like yeah. Because the first time she said no we'll just do it, you know because I like offered then she got into the kind of a fight with me about. You know, like you're trying to emulate and we're going to just do it on our own, I said okay that's fine I don't want you to think i'm manipulating you so you know you're you're good you do it on your own. You know, can you send me a list of all things, and I said okay i'll send you a list of everything needs to be done. And you know that took me a while, which I probably should have just said no, but. But I was like Okay, because I just don't think she I was like you don't get it you think this is gonna be an easy part cuz she gets flipped says this it does i'm like that's that says one thing. But that's not how the process is you know they'll tell you Oh, you have so securing a couple months. Right so she like what she she's not getting it and I was like Okay, so I just sent her that you should then she calls me this is this is so much yeah. Well, you know I guess she thought about it for a few days like well, maybe just you and mom can help me and we'll just not include car and you know and but you know she she she's helping me with other stuff and like uh huh yeah. So, like. You know, I was, I told her, I was like well look i'm not going to do this back and forth thing so like you know I. You know I tried to put up some boundaries like look I just can't I you know it's too stressful and honestly, the best thing I can do if you. Think i'm hurting you're manipulating you because, like she's before this she was convinced that, like, I was like well I need your date of birth and your name and your address well you know all the things that you need to like. kind of hurt. Right well you're going to take that and somehow D fraud me and we're like we also need you know, like a release and the power of attorney and all these different that. you're going to take me off life support if I get on less for your kill me like what are you fucking talking about you really like and that really hurt my mom to was like oh i'm like. You think I would kill my own daughter like i've never done my mom's been nothing but great to my sister and so. This is clearly a manipulation coming from somebody else because that was never even brought up until and she was fine with it until she went and talked to her, you know. And so it's like what like all these things that are suddenly coming out of my sister's mouth i'm like Oh, this is not her. This is this is her abuser and I know that because I did that same shit like. The abuser kind of turns you into whatever they want and you start mimicking them and, like. Whatever they say kind of goes like you know they even if they're if everybody in the world is like hey you know the grass is green and the abusers like. nope the grass is purple you're like yeah no the grass is totally purple even if you can see in front of you, the screen you're like nope it's purple you're absolutely right right. hmm and even if, before you were like Well, no, I think it is green like no you're like you're right, you know what what was I thinking How dare I think that it might be green. I see it, but again she's not in a place where like as my mom keeps pointing out like well, you need to decide, like, if you want to have a relationship with your sister pointing out that she's being abused and Mrs really stubborn and so like it's not gonna."
741.0,Provider,i'm gonna know.
13557.0,Patient,"You got to help right and i'm like trying to do that and, but I am still trying to play out little things like that's interesting so she doesn't want to help. You know, like when she's doing inconsistent logic, I do try to at least point that out that okay so she says she wants to help, but then she doesn't really want to help because we actually here's the things I need help with. You know what she'd be willing to do that well yeah and then i'm like well, she said she wouldn't so are you sure because, like I don't want to this is extra work for me I don't want to make it short and send it to you and then like. You know her not do it and Well, no, and maybe I you know it just goes back and forth, and I mean she did kind of like she had a moment of honesty, where she did tell me, I was like so let me just when we were kind of fight, and I was like, let me just get this straight. You know, car things basically she doesn't want to help she doesn't want to you know, have any involvement with me or my mom for some reason suddenly out of nowhere. Suddenly, and no she. But she does want to sit there and make snarky comments on the side and basically you know whisper in your ear. What we're doing wrong, but she doesn't actually want to be involved to like fix anything or do anything like she just wants to talk, but not like perform. yeah pretty much. Is what I got and it was like oh Okay, so I know exactly what i'm dealing with now like. But it's still frustrating because yeah it's really frustrating when you're trying to help somebody and. they've got somebody else you know talking in their ear and manipulating them and coming back and then like you know they agree to something and they come back and they're like well. No, I don't agree with this anymore I been initially like you know they've been manipulated so they're like don't you don't mind then you're like well Okay, then i'm not gonna I can't help you because you have to put up boundaries like okay you don't want to do this fine. I can't help you that Well, no, no, I need you to well you can't have it both ways right that's just."
741.0,Provider,"You know, it sounds to me like a battery six and a half to be. being made that either you get our assistance or you get her assistance, but the two aren't the same."
13557.0,Patient,yeah well and now.
741.0,Provider,You want to listen to us on this particular subject yeah. you're gonna listen to her and let her help you.
13557.0,Patient,"yeah and that's what I kind of told her and she's like well now Okay, you know I think she deep down realizes that she's not going to help her which is going to leave her really fucked you know so like. I didn't that's why she's like Well, no, you and mom will help me and we'll just keep car out of it i'm like well that's fine but i'm not still not cool with Carl. You know, talking in the background and telling you things and you come back and change in your mind, and you know and your brains not and, on top of that our brains not working so she's extra. confrontational she's extra not understanding things it's just really difficult and so it's like i'm trying not to take it personally. But, and I, you know, and I don't think it is personal I think it's absolutely views but um. You know, it is kind of what it is and now she's saying well cars mom is coming out here and she's going to help i'm like okay. which actually I think this might be a good idea, because Carl wants to take her to Hawaii and basically isolate her and go live with their mother. or with cars mother, which my understanding was they had a strained relationship and it wasn't the best person in the world and i'm like well, maybe this is good, so you can try living with your mother in law i've done that in the past two and oh my God is that the worst."
741.0,Provider,don't say that part just.
13557.0,Patient,"You know Okay, this might be a good trial run, because if you realize how I mean you're already miserable because you're sick right. Right when you're miserable and this gets 10 times worse than this woman doesn't actually make sure, maybe she'll be amazing she'll come help and that's great, but I kind of doubt it bird and. So, like she comes out now you're even more stressed, or more miserable like. you're going to get a glimpse into if you go to Hawaii, you will have nobody to support you, you will be isolated even more than you were and the hallmark of abuses isolation. I realized that too, and you know, like that's exactly what you know cars, trying to do is isolate her because and that's why she doesn't want to help, and the why she doesn't want to have anything to do with us suddenly. Oh, my God, if you guys, you know actually repair relationship and get close to ash and help her. Then i'm not her world anymore right, you know, then i'm it's not as easy for me to abuser because she might actually start listening to what you say you know, once you gain that trust and. Once you've helped her, and if you get her through social security start getting her you know money and food stamps and all these different things, then."
741.0,Provider,Then shut off her.
13557.0,Patient,yeah she.
741.0,Provider,She she.
13557.0,Patient,"yeah and she might actually listened to her family when they're like you know, this seems kind of odd right. And my mom. My mom is really good with like pointing out things that are messed up without like actually she asked me like questions like that's interesting you know if I was. cat."
741.0,Provider,Hello kitty.
13557.0,Patient,"You know she'll be like it'll be like well that's interesting you know I don't know if I was a man with this really be an issue like you know, like. Would they expect this of me, probably not then why do they expect them to you, would you be okay if somebody said this to your mother, no, then why is it Okay, for them to say it's here right like. huh points out that hey things are not cool but she doesn't better way better than I do. And I envy my mom that she's like a hot I want it, you know I get so caught up and trying to save so I love my sister so like if I love you and I care about you i'm. fiercely like I want to protect you especially with my own issues, obviously, like it's like i'm watching her to live by him. And i'm like. I don't want I want better, for you know I don't want you to be me please don't be like."
741.0,Provider,Because i've had but she's gonna have to learn and make her own.
13557.0,Patient,"Mistakes no. And is that's the hardest part about being a parent and like and I know she knows, I mean her daughter, Portugal, but. I know that and I do tend to get a little bit overbearing and i'll admit that and i'm really trying not to but. It just really doesn't help you have somebody in the background manipulating. What are good intentions and then, when I turn on a TV like look I didn't mean it this way and i'm sorry and i'm trying to i'm working in therapy i'm really trying to. change these things if there's something you don't like please tell me i'll try not to get upset like I try to say all that beforehand, so that. there's not so many miscommunications and we are so alike, that you know some times when you're so much like somebody else. You fight right here, you can they push your buttons because. You know they."
741.0,Provider,know where they're at. They know where they're at.
13557.0,Patient,"whoa Why can we not communicate, you know, like. So I really am trying to chain, you know i'm trying to get all my therapy i'm like okay. But it is really hard and and that's in the best of circumstances with it was just me and her, and then you add in an abuser who's manipulating her where she'll be like yes it's fine and then she'll try and know and. I you know and i'm trying to still have my own boundaries to where like i'm trying not to slip back into. Sure i'll yes i'll just i'm so want to save you so i'll let you do i'll let you do whatever you know, like, I will not get up for myself and. yeah if you want to let you know her tell you what to do and then take it out of me hey no problem, like no i'm i'm trying to my own boundaries right to where it's like. If you don't want this, then I can't help you, you know if if i'm spending my time which spending my time is on you means i'm not spending my time on myself and. You know, doing my own self care is on my own, you know medical stuff and it means i'm being detrimental to myself but i'm willing to do that, like, I thought about it i'm willing to do certain to a certain detriment for myself, because I love you and I want better for you."
741.0,Provider,"Right, why is it that you have to be doing detrimental to yourselves."
13557.0,Patient,"So I don't have to, but I. I want to."
741.0,Provider,"Have if you don't have the time and the energy to. Then, should you be giving it."
13557.0,Patient,"Probably not but I really want to repair my relationship with my sister because my parents aren't gonna be around forever. and I think I can't remember a lot of it so like I think it's damaged in a lot of ways that I don't really know another way to like. try to get in and you know repair it, and this is one way that I can get in and. You know, try to be like Okay, you know you have to talk to me like we got to get that you know i'm trying to help you and so like I really. I have kind of wave that like yeah it's detrimental to me, but which one you know which Am I willing to put Am I am i'm willing to put a little bit of detrimental in this in myself, because I do want i'm hoping the positive benefits of. Getting a relationship to for building some kind of relationship with her will be better right and in the long run, and you know it yeah it's a little bit detrimental to me right now, but I can always overcome that, hopefully, in the future, and so. But I can't do too much like there's it's a fine line like I can take a little bit, which is why i'm having a trying to have boundaries of Okay, I can do this much but no further right like I can give you this, but. Past that that's it and if you're going to push back and make life more difficult, and all the you know, like past what i've already told you i'm not I can't do that then you're going to be on your own for sure you know and stick with that boundary because. No i'm not going to give everything and i'm not going to it's only going to go to a certain point that's it and. I thought I did think a lot about this before I offered because I I didn't I didn't want to offer and then take back right I didn't wanna be like Well, no, no i'm just too good all these things are going on right. And yes, things have been kind of I mean last few months have been worse than they will things got better after I moved for a little while there because I got so security and they think we're going up and. You know, I was exercising my health was doing so much better I got on my medication consistently, and it was all good and then like suddenly last month or a couple months or so like. medication seem to have stopped working and so now, like my losing my hair and like I had some teeth issues that a nail issues and, like i've never had those problems before and so there's like a lot of health issues that are just kind of popping up that. I thought were under control. You know they're they're just not and so like i'm seeing a doctor about that, obviously, in a prior to deal with those things but. I did think about all this um it just. And maybe i'm wrong there, I mean maybe. Might having a relationship with my sister isn't worth it, but. I pick her a small little extra stress in my life because before I had made my life pretty fairly stress free because i've addison so. Stress kills me right, like it's not it really can put me in the hospital it's terrible for me because I don't produce my own stress hormones so like yeah. But I you know I, so I really didn't have a lot of contact with her, I didn't have contact with really anybody that stressful at all because it's like nope you're not going to know i'm i'm going to just. Do self cares you know treat myself the way I want to be treated and like who you know he's like my life was doing exactly what I wanted and so yeah I knew when I offered to help her be stressful and so like I knew that would take a total of my health. But I told her you know, like i'm look i'm willing to do a little bit of this and i'm willing to do a little bit of stress like you know, is it I know it can take a toll on my health, and it is, but. Not so much like I just didn't expect the abuse right I didn't I because I had had my suspicions for a while, but i'd never i'd never talked to anybody about it and I always kind of convinced myself and a lot of ways that well that's my own issues right, you know. That is maybe you know i'm just trying to put that on her and that's still the case, but now it's confirmed even my mom can see it and so like yeah. I just it's really hard in the background, when you have somebody else you know not wanting to take accountability and help, but they want to tell you what you're doing wrong but they don't want to offer solutions right."
741.0,Provider,Right right. Right.
13557.0,Patient,I don't know.
741.0,Provider,"Our time is up. But I want you to think about. ways that you can. Possibly. increase communication with your sister. Okay, just communication. Anything else night not help tonight anything else just. Okay. That and then also. Research the groups online, to see if there's anything that you can find that you're interested in and what you would be willing to try. Okay."
13557.0,Patient,"Thank you for listening for it, I guess, I needed to bed. But that's."
741.0,Provider,"Yes, you did. You did. I know."
13557.0,Patient,"Oh yes, thank you."
741.0,Provider,"So I will see you next Tuesday, at the same time."
