15415.0,Patient,Why. Sorry it's really dark in here.
298.0,Provider,that's okay tell me your first and last name and.
15415.0,Patient,510 76.
298.0,Provider,Your head what city and state are you calling from.
15415.0,Patient,say to California.
298.0,Provider,Okay where's that.
15415.0,Patient,Southern California.
298.0,Provider,"Okay gotcha my name is chantel Escobar i'm a psychiatric nurse practitioner I northern California. All right, i'm Sarah I am just pulling up your information. And let's see where you recently in the hospital."
15415.0,Patient,I was.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, your insurance would like you to meet with a provider like myself. it's just to make sure that you're safe that you have a plan for your mental health. If you need any refills I can do that for you, if you have any questions about your medications I can maybe help with that do you have an outside psychiatrist or therapist."
15415.0,Patient,"So I have a therapist that I need to reschedule appointments with. I mean really the whole hospitalization I. it's it's a long story um I basically I survived coven in April of this year and post coven started to develop a lot of symptoms, like a lot of weird symptoms that nobody can explain. There seems to be this this idea of just wait and see, and meanwhile things physically progress and deteriorate and my primary care doctor The week before I went to. northridge hospital floated the idea to me that my anxiety was what was causing my blood pressure surges and he said I don't think I think what's happening is you don't realize how much your mental health is driving your physical health. I went to the emergency room and I just sort of broke down because i've been doing everything that I can from my physical health, so I thought. Well, this must have happened and I, you know I am really anxious and I was not I had stopped being very suddenly being able to sleep at night, and I would wake shaking in the mornings."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15415.0,Patient,"And my internist told me that he suspects, I have a condition called pots. it's postural ortho static check accordia but. Getting a test for that is going to take me until January. So anyway. I went to the emergency room thinking this is everybody else thinks that this is what's going on with me. um. First off, I told them, I was voluntary I was willing to. They didn't tell me in amount of time, so. The clinical social worker that I saw at the hospital came back to me ran my insurance and said I talked to the psychiatrist and he said what he needs to do is keep you. At least overnight so it'll be technically on a hold but it's not a hold you'll if once you've met with him tomorrow, if you want to leave you can leave. Well, of course, the counselor told me the same thing once I got up to the unit told me the same thing turned out to not be accurate um. i'm not i'm not quite sure where It all went horribly wrong, but it did um what I didn't realize was they were going to be completely incapable of caring for my. Physical medical health while I was there, because obviously psychiatric concerns come first, so my blood pressure was going they were giving me deluxe attain my blood pressure with jumped through the roof. They kept telling me it's your anxiety take xanax or it's your anxiety takes air quotes asleep, and it turns out. Essentially I had been in there for five days and I had to tell the psychiatrist. I get spoken to my nurses, while I was there and they kept telling me you're super calm you've only taken xanax twice, while you're here you're super calm you're happy, but your blood pressure is really high maybe it's your blood pressure and not your mental health. Oh, it was sort of this reverse engineering of oh OK so i'm not like going off the deep end which I could have understood to be honest, given everything i've dealt with and I know that I have ptsd I, I know that I do, I had a. definitely have it now. um but I told the psychiatry, as I said, there either he wanted me to stay for the four days, just to see how it went. And I. told him well that's Okay, but i'll be calling my insurance and telling them there's no medical basis for keeping me because I was. I never any point refuse treatment, everything was I was actually asking please help me, because if, if I have lost control of the situation, I need somebody else to point it out, because I feel I feel like i'm doing fine. I know that my anxiety has been worse and i've developed this sort of anticipatory anxiety like i'm anxious now about being anxious."
298.0,Provider,i'm saying.
15415.0,Patient,"i'm going to be out somewhere and my blood pressure is going to go out of control and. You know what we found out, though, is that yeah I have this it's something to do with them an autonomic dysfunction of the adrenaline in my body that's causing this like crazy out of control thing but. yeah I mean i'm not saying that I don't need mental health care i'm just saying it wasn't it wasn't the crisis that it was reported to be when. I got up at the hospital and I do feel like the hospital. Specifically it's like high interest really shamefully took advantage of it. I mean, he released people he released three people that commit were attempting suicide. On the day that he was trying to get me to stay. Because I have really insurance and I told him point out to me wearing all of this i'm eating i'm taking the medications that you're giving me i'm sleeping. i'm not bipolar i'm not manic i'm not suicidal so where I don't understand where the dangerous and they still couldn't really explain it to me but marcy who made the appointment with you. Was super helpful and just said, you know kind of take the experience for what it is, which i'm certainly doing that. But yeah it's sort of been a roller coaster ride like like I said I know I have ptsd but I don't even know what the treatments are for ptsd apart from antidepressants that don't really seem I get all of the really shitty side effects sadly."
298.0,Provider,i'm so sorry that sounds so traumatic it. Almost feels like you were hijacked.
15415.0,Patient,"Oh, that that 100% is what happened and I got scared because I didn't realize I didn't think it was legal for mental health professionals to lie to you. to your face multiple times. Okay well. that's the thing that's the thing i'm going to follow up on. Because the the social worker in the er told me because she kept saying you poor thing like you've just been through so much and you don't know you don't know what's happening um and I said yeah that's pretty much all I needed was an overnight stay. And to gain some perspective, but instead it was, oh no, you have to stay and I had to kind of I didn't have a cell phone or anything I was documenting my own blood pressure and managed to prove that the deluxe a team was making my blood pressure, go up. And it doesn't everybody, but for a person that's going through what i'm dealing with right now, this autonomic dysfunction it's it's not uncommon for it to happen, I had a smaller I told them when I went in I took Prozac for four days and It made me one it really made me want to die. My whole body was just rigid. All the time relax um I felt like a real basket case, and so, then they gave me the cymbalta which he said, should be a different experience and. yeah it honestly i'm 45 years old, when I was 19 or 20 i'm from England, I did acid one time ever, will would never do again, I can only described my cymbalta experience as a bad acid trip. um yeah the whole thing was a mess, I was super disturbed because there were a couple of other people. In the unit that had a similar experience, although I could understand Okay, you seem like you were really frantic about the anniversary of a rape or you know something like that, in my case, it was literally guy someone helped me out here, am I in a crisis, and I don't know it. Because I just. everybody's telling me that it has to be my mental health and maybe they're right, and I think being in there, ironically, made me realize how i'm not i'm very, very anxious but i'm not depressed. Ironically, that experience didn't make me depressed while I was in there, because I kept thinking man, you could really just spend weeks and even months in this place. If they're. telling you that they don't feel like."
298.0,Provider,I.
15415.0,Patient,feel like you're okay um. So yeah That was really trippy.
298.0,Provider,"I am so sorry this has happened to you that just sounds terrible I I wouldn't I would think that that would have an adverse effect on your blood pressure, like it was just circulate. me yeah."
15415.0,Patient,"It could have been, but I just think I was so resigned after the first two days, because they gave me. Like a printed out notice of a 14 day hold which just blew my mind, of how if a person is eating and medically complying and is not in any kind of state of hysteria, how do you justify a 14 day hold and they wouldn't even discuss it with me. And so I just I became very calm, because I just thought I can't affect this I can't affect it I can't change it. If I fight with them if I disagree with them it's only going to make it worse, so I just have to kind of settle in for the long haul. And you know I would be sitting and chatting to my nurse, and they would take my blood pressure and then all of a sudden my blood pressure is like at one point, it was like in the high 90s over 110 and. I wasn't stressed, what did stress me was they kept telling me i'm on medications for that which they. didn't give me and they kept telling me they would call the medical doctor, but then they didn't and they said Well, this is psychiatric unit your mental health well being is our first thing and so medical well beings always going to be a second thing. So one thing I feel like i've. developed this great like heaping dose of medical trauma on top of everything else to where. I don't know that I don't know that i'll be able to feel like I can speak freely. I ever have to go to the emergency room for anything anxiety related again um. And, and you know my the anxiety is connected to this. postural or the static tachycardia because anything that you find remotely stressful you can't really do anymore."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15415.0,Patient,"Because it's Either that, or have a pacemaker fitted."
298.0,Provider,to regulate heart.
15415.0,Patient,So i'm dealing with a whole lot of fun day. answers.
298.0,Provider,"Well, I wish you the best as you find the care that you need for this. You it sounds intense um who is your support system."
15415.0,Patient,My husband. he's been really great.
298.0,Provider,Good are you working.
15415.0,Patient,"i'm not able to work right now, because that would require standing i'm a makeup artist, so my job, usually requires me standing for roughly 10 hours a day. Who I can't stand for even two hours right now. Because my blood pressure drops. Because look sort of pools, and my legs i'm having to wear the medical compression stockings and stuff to try and help it but doesn't help a whole lot and i'm also massively de conditioned because of the coven. Because I mean I had it I didn't just have your regular co fit I had bilateral pneumonia and I developed a heart complication while I was in the hospital where. One of my lungs collapsed, the air from Philips long went into the plural cavity and was pressurizing the main blood vessels into my heart. So and that's that's how also I mean the pulmonologist even told me in the hospital when you get out of here you're gonna need to get treated for ptsd because they have to be super honest with me about things that were happening to my body. and I. There was nobody else you know they had to tell me. And it got to a point where I was in there for 14 days and I think I only slept with three of the nights. My body just would not would not shut off because I was so convinced that if I slept I wouldn't wake up again."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, oh yeah sleep deprivation that just makes everything worse Oh, my goodness, no Of course you can't work, this is hard times you're going through i'm. Just curious where do you stand on the vaccine, now that you've gone through koeppen."
15415.0,Patient,"So literally everybody told me everybody told me to get the vaccine my pulmonologist my primary care doctor everybody told me get the vaccine in. 60% of cases it cures long covert symptoms in the other 40% it doesn't do anything they didn't tell me that in some cases. Where the person's had a really severe immune response, or has like a underlying health issue that nobody knows about could just be shitty DNA. That your body can react really poorly to the vaccine, because my first instance of high blood pressure, was the first day that I got the first shot. My blood pressure, went to 160 and. The emergency room doctor that I saw told me Oh, this is a vaccine reaction. This is in when I told her while I was in the hospital for two weeks she said yeah your body's probably not going to handle this thing very well, because it really puts you through it when I got the second shot, I felt myself decline. This is just one. started then and i'm not blaming the vaccine, because I don't know that with my case history, I would have been able to not having had it. i'd be too scared to ever to ever get it again because. I mean when I got released from the hospital the nurses came out with me and we're crying when they saw me get reunited with my kids So for me, I wanted to uphold my end of things and do everything that I could do not to get it again, but. When I got the second shot. And I wasn't like Tara I mean, apart from the conditioning I wasn't terribly unhealthy within four hours of getting the second shot um I was so congested I had post nasal drip I had a terrible cough I had a fever, have you. I couldn't see them right, I was like that, for two days and then those symptoms disappeared and I keep thinking I don't know that I would be all right, giving that to a small child."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15415.0,Patient,"I don't think so because my body just, especially if it was someone that was to have underlying autoimmune issue. You. Just don't know them. When they're talking about third like the booster I don't know that I can do that I don't know that I I don't know that I can do it every single doctor that told me to do it. said oh yeah there's people that are getting horrible things like parkinson's disease after getting this vaccine we don't know that it's because of the vaccine. But we also don't know that it's not because it's what it's doing is it's tinkering with your immune system. And covert is doing the nurses in the hospital told me, the only thing we know about this virus is that it hits everyone differently it doesn't look the same on everybody and that seems to be the same for the vaccine. I know people that, had it in or didn't have a problem didn't have any side effects nothing, and I wish that it had been that."
298.0,Provider,"Did you get the fight, sir. Yes, sir. we're just supposed to be."
15415.0,Patient,"Right moderna I wish i'd gotten modern it because I keep hearing now that modern, it is the one that people were feeling better on and it results in a higher like a higher amount of antibodies whereas Pfizer after. True, it probably leaves you with about 65% immunity, but because I had an original infection. So this is the other thing about when I went to northridge they had a when I went to the emergency room that day that I got admitted they had three covert cases that were in the hallway that were in rooms and I was in the hallway outside of those rooms on a gurney waiting to be seen. And I kept telling them guys I can't be sitting here because I had covered in April and they kept they kept telling me well, if you have the vaccine and you had an infection you've got a better chance than anybody of surviving coven. And I just kept thinking I don't want to, because I know that for a week I will be worrying that I caught this thing again. And Sure enough, even when I was in in the behavioral health unit there, I was so concerned of I was sleeping in a room with a roommate and I kept thinking, please don't let me have color coded and give it to this poor girl who has diabetes, because. You know that would be pretty catastrophic. I honestly think it's just the thing that we're all going to have to live with and deal with now. They talk. hospital they had patients even that had had kidney transplants that were completely asymptomatic."
298.0,Provider,Was they were. asymptomatic and while they had Robin.
15415.0,Patient,They had coven.
298.0,Provider,And they were a symptom.
15415.0,Patient,asymptomatic they weren't coughing they didn't have a fever.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15415.0,Patient,They had Kobe.
298.0,Provider,"You know I just listened to a talk yesterday morning about. Some research that's being done about anxiety and coven if you have anxiety and you get coven your outcomes are a lot poorer than if you didn't have anxiety and so what a good reason, because anxiety is directly related to your immune system. yeah and. And so um yeah i've been promoting this book here with my patients, you get it off of an."
15415.0,Patient,"Amazon. I have that book yeah. Oh yeah i've been there, done that more in the T shirt. i'm looking at things like you know there's other things out there, like it. Is it dialectic behavioral therapy and i'm just trying to figure out what things are more likely to work and what things."
298.0,Provider,are not.
15415.0,Patient,snake oil for lack of a better term.
298.0,Provider,"I here's What I do know it's not much, but. When we when the cerebral spinal on one study cerebral spinal fluid was looked out for it serotonin levels on ptsd people and non ptsd people. The ptsd people had a decrease in serotonin levels, hence why we give serotonin medications to ptsd now, is it the best treatment I don't think, so I think you're going to get your best treatment at working through the trauma than to use the medicine to put a bandaid on it. And I prescribe medicines all day long so. But ptsd is just one of those things that. has a lot of work to do and yeah."
15415.0,Patient,"that's how I feel I feel like it's if I just take a medication and think well i'm taking a medication, so I should be able to move past this that's a big mistake because it's The thing that keeps sort of manifesting itself. i'm actually downloaded an APP called bloom that is like cognitive behavioral therapy um and you know I listened to the first session, it was on illness and I thought oh my gosh that's so right that you know we we can be afraid and anxious because of illness but we can't control it."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15415.0,Patient,"thing that's beyond our control so to be anxious over it is to waste it's to waste your energy on something really um and that maybe it's better to sort of. Ask yourself questions and answer yourself about well what's The worst thing that would happen if you know this is what's wrong with me and that's kind of. Where i'm at now but, but I did realize when I was in the when I was in that behavioral health unit oh Lord, I do have so much even just nurses coming into a room at night. It was. Somehow like weirdly explosive the only night that it didn't have that effect on me was they gave me on one of the nights they gave me 100 milligrams of seroquel to sleep. Because I had only slept a couple hours The night before they gave me the seroquel and apparently it took two nurses and the third on standby to I was half hanging out of the bed. My roommates and it took two nurses to come in and sort of they tried to wake me up and nobody could wake me, and so they repositioned me in the bed. Which just made me resolve to never take seroquel for sleep, even though they prescribed it to me because."
298.0,Provider,I saw that. yeah I hear you.
15415.0,Patient,"The reason that i'm not sleeping is there's the adrenaline and my body is not firing correctly or functioning correctly so. My room it's a lot less scary once you see that, for what it is, it means that I just I tell myself i'm keeping my eyes close. i'm not gonna open my eyes i'm not getting out of the bed i'm staying in the bed, even if i'm not sleeping it because it'll be rest."
298.0,Provider,"it's better than. So, every time your body has a stress response i'm just talking out loud i'm wondering what it does on the brain, for your ptsd so. I is it reinforcing the neuro pathways and you're not even realizing it."
15415.0,Patient,Probably.
298.0,Provider,I know. kind of a bummer to say that.
15415.0,Patient,"That was kind of sad, my primary care doctor was telling me well, he prescribed me xanax and he was telling me well just take it every day. In the behavioral health unit, I told them when I went in I said I take it, maybe three times a week and I feel like i'm too reliant on it. Their answer to that was to prescribe it to me for up to four times a day if I wanted it and I only took it two times and I was trying to explain to them that, for me, becoming reliant upon a medication like that is scarier to me."
298.0,Provider,And living.
15415.0,Patient,With the anxiety forever.
298.0,Provider,It is so easy to build tolerance on xanax so so easy and then you need more and then it's a vicious cycle and. yeah I applaud you up you know you're going to make appointments you're going to work on your mental health and you're going to do it without medicine as much as you can at least that's what i'm hearing.
15415.0,Patient,"know for sure, I mean the only thing that I got prescribed yesterday, my primary care doctor prescribed me rest are ill for sleep. Because and i'm Well he gave it to me yesterday I didn't take it last night because I wanted. it's, not that I like torturing myself at all it's just that I hate this idea that. One side to prove to myself that I can only rest with this medication then i'm sort of beholden to it forever."
298.0,Provider,And I.
15415.0,Patient,"I don't want that to be the case. um but apart from that, you know i'm not i'm not taking xanax because I know I mean i'm a person that I had. I had childhood trauma from age to. pitch pitch, to be honest, I mean since i'm talking to you, I may as well talk about it my I had a father, that was an alcoholic I was the oldest of three children. And from me being at my earliest memory so it's around two he had a lock on the outside of my bedroom door and he would unscrew the light bulb and put me in my room and lock me in. So something about well that that was part of what he did he was very physically and mentally abusive to um. When I was really small he would never hit me it was always my mother um I watched her when I was maybe four years old, he sort of pinned to the wall and was choking her and she was reminding me the other day she was six months pregnant at the time. But these were all things, it was the home that I grew up in it wasn't until I was much older, I think, maybe 11 where I was able to like stay overnight at somebody else's house and realize wait. Not these other people don't live like this, they don't their parents are at first, I thought it was a trick. Because my dad will be really nice to when there were strangers to but realizing oh that was just the thing that my dad did all the time and then being in the behavioral health unit where you're in this. you're you're in this room and you sort of have all agency taken away from you same when I was in the medical isolation Ward with Kobe all of it just brought it all back."
298.0,Provider,Absolutely it.
15415.0,Patient,"brought it all back into it my dad my dad died of lung cancer in 2015 and failing this completely irrational after six years resurgence of this anger towards my dad and this frustration that i'm never going to have an explanation from him. going to have a moment of reckoning it's never going to get worked out because he's gone. And that feels really unfair like I deserve some kind of. answer, and then I realized well, the only answer i'm going to get is from myself."
298.0,Provider,Because I have.
15415.0,Patient,And I know that you don't do that to kids. yeah he was extraordinarily miss.
298.0,Provider,"that's exactly where I my thought was how do you do a reckoning, you know that you need to be kind to yourself, because you would never do that, to a child, so you need to just. I guess that you know that therapy about the inner child, you know being kind and talking sweetly to because you didn't get that as a kid."
15415.0,Patient,"No, I didn't I didn't get that as a kid what it has made me do, though, is, I am a. I think I was such a pain in the ass to them at the northridge hospital, because while i'm very compliant. I I won't let people i'm gonna sound use terrible phrase here, I will let people give me shit and tell me it's sugar."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15415.0,Patient,"Because I in my house that I grew up in we never crazily enough, we didn't talk for 17 years we didn't talk about what my dad did, and what. Nobody was ever allowed to talk about it, it was the thing that only as I became much older and I would physically stand up to him that it became it became a thing. Otherwise, it was just Oh, we don't we don't talk about that, why do you want to keep bringing all that old stuff up well because it's still with me there's times that I. Things on TV and in movies and. Most of the time it won't be bad parenting it'll be actually really nice parenting. And i'll have terrible moment of. What failed that I didn't I didn't get that. yeah like literally got the opposite of that, but you know it's i'm also really tired of being angry at a man that suffered horribly and i'd a long time ago and it's. But it just this year has been like a real shit pile fit."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15415.0,Patient,"And then. Whether it was through the vaccine, or whether it was just months down the road from coven I developed this other disorder which now coming to find out that my father probably had some of the symptoms of this disorder. Which that's a whole trip by itself too, because as much as I try and tell myself that i'm very different to him."
298.0,Provider,you're 50% him.
15415.0,Patient,"Yes, and apparently genetically I have some things."
298.0,Provider,Some big thing.
15415.0,Patient,"With them right now um you know, so I was to think about and work on."
298.0,Provider,"I wish I could give you the gift of him being alive and you having it out with them, you know I wish you could have that experience. I had an experience. In my bag was about 25 years old, that the person who was an alcoholic and abuser to me step grandfather very abusive. I got mad and blew up at him in front of my grandma and he said let's go for a walk and and I went with her walk with him and I was, I was red hot mad and I couldn't. I what I said to him how dare you talk to me like that, for the way you treated me as a child, I said that in front of my grandmother which we had always tried to protect my grandmother from my step grandfather, and what he done we went for a walk and my grandfather said. A very lame apology, it was a different he said something that like it was a different time in my life i'm sorry for that, and it was lame but at least I have it, you know and i've been able to look at his life and. yeah find some compassion there that I didn't have before that moment."
15415.0,Patient,"I mean I got something of a fashion, from my dad because my dad just said, you won't understand regret until you have it with your own children and you can't change it, and he said he asked me because he."
298.0,Provider,Is.
15415.0,Patient,"In England and I moved here to to. haha and he came to visit me in 2013 and I always remember, he asked me how did you learn to be the way that you are with your children, and I said you're not gonna like the answer, are you sure you want it, and he said yeah I said everything that you did I turned it upside down. I did the if everything that you did, and he told me some stuff that was pretty revealing but it just felt more like he was excusing himself, he told me that his mother had really and I, and I can really see it his mother had abused him pretty significantly when he was a child. there's two there's two ways to react to things like this, and I see it, even in my own family of with us three children you either do the opposite, or you perpetuate the same shit my brother perpetuated the same ship with his children for about 15 years. And you know that was unbelievable to me how can you have the memories, that we have and you're going to do that. same thing um but yeah I mean it taught me a lot of things, I mean listen, I understand i'm never i'm never going to get i'm never going to get that moment with my dad."
298.0,Provider,i'm never going to get it.
15415.0,Patient,"he's never gonna. he's never gonna get to explain himself to me, I know him well enough to know that he couldn't have explained himself to me anyway."
298.0,Provider,Oh that's a good point.
15415.0,Patient,"He just never he never tried, I mean. an ugly the the household that I grew up in is what happens when a woman marries her stalker a sense that. The home that I grew up in. A in a family. wise when I was in my 20s it's either you can be a victim of this for your entire life or you can move past it. As a like a good learning tool, because it was terrible example and that all works until this year when a bunch of other things happened and I realized well i've been telling myself that I was. So unaffected by this, and that I had a lot of distance from it, but unfortunately I think it was hammered into me at such a young age that it can't leave me."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15415.0,Patient,Like that feeling of. insecurity at night and fear connected to nighttime is very it's tied.
298.0,Provider,To my memories.
