13868.0,Patient,Let me fix my audio real quick. Okay how's that.
528.0,Provider,Good sounds good here.
13868.0,Patient,"Every time I redo it like I switched back and forth my work account to my personal account the audio gets all jacked. up, so I forget about it until i'm seeing miming."
528.0,Provider,Well that's. that's annoying actually problem sure for you.
13868.0,Patient,"It is OK, though."
528.0,Provider,yeah um so are you on your work trip is that right.
13868.0,Patient,I am I just got here got all settled.
528.0,Provider,uh huh where were you out again.
13868.0,Patient,"In lubbock Texas. Okay, so we're have clinical starting tomorrow. So here we are, for the weekend."
528.0,Provider,How do you feel about that.
13868.0,Patient,"I am incredibly anxious about it i'm. Two of the four. Two of the three women that i'm here with our. How do I say this older. And so, one of them was telling me about how their usual trips go since i'm the newest faculty and they just like we could we'd after clinical and we go to dinner and. That it made me go shopping or whatever, and I was like i'm don't count me on the reservations just yet, I have to take that kind of step by step."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13868.0,Patient,"to it, she said well why and which i'm open about it, and I said well i'm in a eating disorder recovery program and I just don't know how i'm gonna. i'm gonna feel and she said, well, what do you, what do you mean, and I was like well eating in public is already really difficult for me much less like i'm just in a really raw emotional state anyways. As a result of the program right now. And I said so I don't want to commit myself to anything and she's like so like because of the masks or what's going on, so. I don't have a very supportive group of group of people. And then I was telling my husband before I left it's that situation, combined with i'm afraid afraid, is a strong word i'm nervous if I bow out and don't go eat with them, then a i'll hear about it all day the next day. Because i'm with i'm scheduled with that particular lady. Okay, secondly I then I don't have anybody accountable here with me. So he said that he would. Be on facetime with me if I needed that to be sure that I didn't you know skip or purge or anything, so there is a failsafe there but. it's just anxious i'm just anxious about it."
528.0,Provider,"I mean, would it help to kind of. You know, maybe coming up with a plan for the weekend, like I don't know how much you can plan ahead that you know, maybe you know your schedule, or we can kind of figure out something eating plan. To kind of lesson igniting know yeah that was it I just didn't say to lessen the anxiety."
13868.0,Patient,"So I think i'm going to I know i'll be okay for like breakfast and then snacks during the day. because those are already like already be at the hospital and have access to those that are brought some snacks with me. Okay it'll be at dinner and then at night, like the nighttime stack. Okay, be the tricky one."
528.0,Provider,What about lunch.
13868.0,Patient,i'll be at the hospital.
528.0,Provider,"Oh lunches at the hospital sorry I missed that Okay, no breakfast and lunch breakfast you feel okay with lunch is at the hospital so you're fine with that. mom and then do you know what they're serving like at the hospital or do."
13868.0,Patient,They have yeah they have like. A chick fil a and like little restaurants within the hospital food.
528.0,Provider,or okay.
13868.0,Patient,"So there's there's plenty of options i'll get a better idea in the morning. Okay, because, from what I understand the layout is is when we get to the facility to the hospital we take our students and give them to the nurses. take them for the day and then we come we go do our own thing like. read a book or whatever. And then we just go pick the students back up for lunch and then eat as a big group. Okay, and then deliver and back on their unit for the afternoon session, so we have a little bit of fluidity there as far as so in the morning when we drop them off we're going to come back to the cafeteria and scope it out."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, but you're not feeling nervous about that part of it, it sounds good."
13868.0,Patient,"I feel okay i've been to this hospital it's actually the hospital is worn out we're thinking. Which is pretty cool I like that it feels a little the clinical itself i'm not worried about i'm excited to be back in a hospital setting. I feel like. Since I was a travel nurse it's. It feels familiar it's just the. The dinner eating like the expectation to eat with this group of women who, who already make me nervous because they're experienced. in life, they were my instructors they're very opinionated and it's all you know talks about political crap and it's just they're just anxiety inducing in general on their own. Okay, so."
528.0,Provider,"yeah so with even without like your own sort of food, food fears, you know just eating in public or just you know I wonder is is that the main thing, do you worry also about like. What you're eating in front of them or anything like that, or is it more, just like the act of eating in front of them. Both okay."
13868.0,Patient,"One of them is very. very vocal about being on the Atkins diet, sometimes ironically she's a vegetarian. So i'm not like that's confusing already I mean that's really not the point of the story, but. So she already has her very strong like food roles, so I already have weird issues with her around, because if i'm eating meat I oddly feel guilty because she's there. she's always got something to say about you know being on keto or. yeah or whatever, and she is my mentor with writing curriculum for my next semesters class and so she kind of knows. A little bit more about the program and what i'm dealing with because i've had more one on one time with her, but when she's around this other individual. All of that kind of goes out the window so she kind of gets whipped up with this other lady. You know, not that they're hateful about it, but it doesn't have to be hateful it can be anything just an observation on their part of like oh you don't look like you have an eating disorder or something. ignorant I guess. Like that that. I know it's coming because i've heard it already happened. But not really sensitive to it. And the other lady days."
528.0,Provider,"You said, these things out loud, or you just. sense of this."
13868.0,Patient,"Oh there's no, they said them. And then the other girl that i'm going with this bringing her mother who she's told me that her mother has been seen an Inpatient rehab for eating disorders and she has her own. How did she put it. She has her own food issues but she's trying to do recovery, on her own right now but she's she's still in the mindset of. You know she's trying to eat intuitively like that so it's I don't know she's still spends a lot of time talking about it and it's not like she's not solid enough to. Certainly, be a support person for me because I can't be a support person for her yet."
528.0,Provider,You know.
13868.0,Patient,"So I don't have like I don't have any allies in that moment, so that. I don't know. yeah I don't know if it's safer for me to like make a plan to get food on the way back from clinical and just commit to facetime me with my husband so he'll be my account accountability buddy. And just deal and just you know claim that i'm tired and want to go back to the hotel and not go out. yeah because i'd rather shoulder the. Oh, my gosh man he couldn't handle it because she's so tired. versus the. US you know they don't eating disorders are valid to them much less the understanding so. ya know what's. better option."
528.0,Provider,"Well, what what is the best thing for you to do like. Can you this one, feel more like not what's best for them, or you know, like what what feels. The best for you are you able to are like yeah."
13868.0,Patient,"I feel like the best thing for me, it will be just to not go with them. To dinner. And just not even take the gamble honestly. um. yeah I think that would be the better option."
528.0,Provider,"Right, because, at least, then, and if your husband is going to be there to support you and making sure that you eat a meal because really that's. That is ultimately that's, the most important thing is like, if you go there, like what could happen if you go there let's let's play that out like. Like what would be where do you imagine happening."
13868.0,Patient,"i'm. Just the anxiety of being in public already eating and everything that that entails, which is. You know feeling like everybody is staring at me and watching me eat and that whole. thing. On top of being there with a group of people i'm not super comfortable with anyways. So it's like unsafe, on top of unsafe. Yes, I feel like the trigger potential or the probable triggers outweigh the. The benefit of going and doing it right now."
528.0,Provider,"yeah and then, how would that like. Heightened anxiety that you're having because of that that affect your eating like, would you be able to eat normally would that impact your eating at all or."
13868.0,Patient,"Not I think I would you know choose a salad or something safe. Okay, and then, depending on how the conversation went during dinner, the temptation to come back here and purge would be really high. So I don't really want to risk that."
528.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely I agree with you, and then, if you. If you decide that you, you stay, you know go just get some food and like go back to the hotel room and then just call your husband. Then, is there any downside to that."
13868.0,Patient,"Just the potential for the ladies to feel neglected, I guess, or maybe even offended that I didn't. go with them when they're trying to make me feel like part of the fold."
528.0,Provider,You know.
13868.0,Patient,hurting hurting their feelings I guess.
528.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and again that's about them, though it's not about. Right right like it's you'd be doing that you'd be putting yourself in a position, like that would actually do harm for you just to please them kind of or just to like kind of make them happy almost is that right."
13868.0,Patient,I make sense yeah yes ma'am i'll make sense.
528.0,Provider,So if you don't go you're actually looking out for yourself you're doing things that like you know you're you're going to feel mentally better. Because you're out of that scenario and then. you'll be able to actually feed yourself in the healthy way right yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"Okay, I can definitely Thank you I just needed to talk that through."
528.0,Provider,"Well, I think yeah no i'm glad you fell, but better because you know I think just probably the unknown of thinking what am I going to do. My i'm just assuming probably makes that it just like you're it's already an anxiety provoking situation and then like you're like I don't know what to do you know kind of like that kind of adds to the anxiety like. that's why I said, like maybe just come just make a decision and come up with just just like that way you don't have to keep. kind of I don't know just keep designing you're trying to figure out what you're going to do just making a decision might actually just help you relax and feel better that makes sense."
13868.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. I have a hard time separating. Making other people feel bad. Because they feel so selfish to me, you know, like I that's never how i've been so it's what I need to take care of myself is really."
528.0,Provider,know for sure.
13868.0,Patient,yeah this will be good.
528.0,Provider,"It will be good yeah absolutely and you know I mean this is just a thought I don't think it's i'm just gonna throw it out there, but if you know, maybe there's another way you can. kind of I don't know if this is even something you want, but like bond with them like it doesn't have to be over a meal, maybe you just I don't know i'm just again bringing this idea out like. Maybe it's something else that you do that, like you can share together that's not with food, I don't know or it's not a meal, so that. Or maybe."
13868.0,Patient,"From what I understand there's. there's plenty of time for that bonding and i'm glad you put it that way, because I didn't make that connection there's plenty of time for that bonding. When the students are off on their own."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, oh yeah."
13868.0,Patient,"cuz I mean I did do a clinical with them, it was a local hospital, but it was during coven and the students couldn't do anything. Okay, and so I mean we literally were just in a room kind of off by ourselves for for a while."
528.0,Provider,Just how I know that she's such an intense individual.
13868.0,Patient,"But I feel like in a conversational setting I think i've got enough skills so far to be able to kind of just change the subject if she wants to start. You know, under the guise of trying to understand. yeah hundred eating I can kind of redirect it and I feel comfortable saying i'm not in a place where I can discuss it yet it's still really. Raw. yeah shutting it down that way, so I feel comfortable in my skills to do that so. I think it'll be okay."
528.0,Provider,"yeah so you mean like when they asked like, why not like why why aren't you doing this you're going. To explain it that way."
13868.0,Patient,"yeah or even just a casual because I leave work early every day that we have group. So it's obvious it's everywhere it's obvious that I do that. Which is why i'm so open because we have a really small faculty there's only nine of us. I don't really mind them, knowing that but if she's. If she comes at it from the just trying to understand it that's usually how her. Like how her political conversations start she'll ask a question and then it offer sort of the ability to just. blow that door wide open for her to talk about it. wow which with politics i'm pretty good at tuning it out, because I just don't have the capacity for it. And there are certain questions that I don't mind answering for people. But I think i'm getting pretty good about when that turns into it becoming about her and her opinion of it. versus where i'm at with the reality of it. Right, you know, for example, she so she knows my health history, she was actually working at the hospital during the day of my stroke."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
13868.0,Patient,"She came back the next day for clinical I was gone and she was like what happened. And then she got on Facebook and I guess my mom had put it, I don't know how the whole thing panned out but. So she knew about it, and so last year when we were going to clinical together the little hospital she was asking me a little bit about it and, at the time I was waiting to do the GI scope and waiting to do the cardiology appointment. And I kept referring to my nurse practitioner as like what stephanie said blah blah blah and. She was like oh I don't know call me crazy, but why don't you go to a real doctor, because you want real answers. And then came this whole big thing about essentially being anti nurse practitioners, as far as their knowledge bases go, and so I just let it happen because my experience with physicians has been the opposite of hers I guess. yeah if I just I just let it happen and kind of shut it down and then you know a little while later after my results were in she was asking me how the results came out and. So I was telling her you know scar tissue and my heart is all jacked and stuff and she was like what are they what are they going to do was like nothing we should go to get a second opinion so it's always very like that black and white thinking. yeah and that's just hard hard to deal with when it's directed at you it's very intense energy and."
528.0,Provider,yeah it sounds.
13868.0,Patient,But. Like I said I feel like I feel pretty strong of my ability to be like sidestep it. or just flat out tell her I can't I can't talk about this anymore i'm sorry let's talk about President Biden or something and then give her something that she. can run with. anyways.
528.0,Provider,"yeah so it sounds like she's just like got this personality that she's just a type of person that you have to like learn how to manage i'm also like hedda. Yes, I like take care of yourself because she's not I don't know like she kind of doesn't seem like she's. And she's not caring for others it's more about like her own opinions and our own way, are thinking and so you've sort of adapt to like you've kind of recognize that and need to like adapt to that, like in order to keep yourself like safe."
13868.0,Patient,definitely yes accurate.
528.0,Provider,"yeah I hear that um. yeah that's tough well Okay, I mean, as far as so and how many of you there so today's Thursday, are you there through Sunday is it like three. Days."
13868.0,Patient,i'll be going home Sunday.
528.0,Provider,evening okay so it's like three dinners that you are for dinners.
13868.0,Patient,"Yes, for dinners."
528.0,Provider,And I was OK.
13868.0,Patient,"So I think once I I you know I flew in here, so I don't know where my surroundings are but i'm pretty familiar with the town. So i'm going to whenever we're finished and I have a little bit of time and I gotta go get my food challenge food give me a good idea of where I can go grab dinner and and formulate a plan from there."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, then."
13868.0,Patient,"So I I feel better like I don't feel overwhelmed by that, so thank you."
528.0,Provider,"yeah no i'm glad, of course, and so yeah. that's the tough situation but yeah i'm glad you kind of seems like you've made a made a decision i'm."
13868.0,Patient,sure.
528.0,Provider,"made a plan so and in terms of like choosing foods this past week, how has that been for you, I mean I looked over your log and everything but i'm just curious like. You know I don't know was there any any or just maybe not maybe not just that, but just in general, was there anything that was challenging for you this week. or something that you're proud of, or."
13868.0,Patient,"Oh i'm challenging wise. would be variety, I mean by that I mean, so my daughter's supposed to be doing all this cooking right she's with her dad every other week, so this week, she was with her dad and so she wasn't cooking because she doesn't. She doesn't need to be cooking when she's going to be leaving like that's not fair, so I told her, I was like you don't have to cook, but let me know what nights you are going to cook because I need to be on my game for it and. She did not do that because she's 15 and. she's 15."
528.0,Provider,"that's, all I can say."
13868.0,Patient,"So when dinnertime came and it was really busy week for me at work too so it's dinnertime came I found myself just grabbing like another lunch at school or two and just trying to get as many. whatsoever word i'm looking for food groups, as I could, without so it was more easy and convenient style foods, but I noticed that when I do, that I feel. yucky or like physically feel more bloated and and I already noticed, I wrote that down for you, too, is, I noticed that the probiotic is helping immensely."
528.0,Provider,Oh good i'm so glad.
13868.0,Patient,"That I was still at night is when I get really bloated. Okay, and it doesn't matter what I eat at night it's just a bloated at night so. don't know what significant that has."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so wait so go back. Sorry, you said that like when you try to get the different food groups. It actually makes you feel worse is that we you."
13868.0,Patient,"know I mean like so like a watchable, for example, has crackers and Turkey and cheddar. rice, so I would eat that and then like grapes seem to be more frequent choice this week because that's what I had on hand I didn't want him to go bad. But I don't know if it was in my head or what but just eating that package lunch trouble. felt weird like felt like I was. cheating the system, I guess, like I should have been cooking dinner at night."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
13868.0,Patient,"Okay, instead of having like. I don't know what a lunchtime food for dinner I don't know that was a new. That was a new feeling for me because I hadn't really. I feel like at work it's fine I mean because it's I have to eat quickly at work oftentimes we're working through lunch anyways. i'm just eating. conveniently and that's okay. But at dinnertime it felt really like. I didn't put any effort into it."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm okay. i'm sorry.
13868.0,Patient,It was hard for me to differentiate if I was tired and letting myself rest and then having an easy access dinner.
528.0,Provider,yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"I was just eating mechanically because I did that a couple of times, just because I had other crap going on, or whatever um. I don't know it's hard to differentiate what was happening, but I did eat so there's that."
528.0,Provider,"yeah I noticed, you did really well with the eating this week, I mean, I think you might have only skipped I think I looked there was maybe one day skip breakfast it looked like you woke up late or something. yeah and then there might have been just one like one maybe two snacks. But it seemed like for the most part, I think you, you did really good at like eating breakfast lunch and dinner. And I feel like your choices honestly I think I think you didn't really go with your choices, I feel like you tried to get all the food groups and. So so but it sounds it sounds like what you're talking about is I thought you meant like you felt bad physically when you ate the food, food, but it sounds like you mean like just the idea of not putting effort into it, or something was like maybe bad mentally."
13868.0,Patient,Right well and physically I feel bad at night anyways. So that was it's both.
528.0,Provider,"But can can, are you able to recognize that there's some kind of. Maybe belief or rule behind that like as you were talking I heard you know it's like I should have I should have done it this way, you know."
13868.0,Patient,yeah I think there is. I don't know it's hard to put words to i've I always feel like a good mom if there's a home cooked dinner.
528.0,Provider,mm hmm okay.
13868.0,Patient,"um because all my kids enjoy that even if it's just my 15 year old cooking it, it makes me feel like because I taught her to cook so i'm proud of that. And I want to eat her food because she. Put love in preparation into it and all the rest of it, and then, of course, if i'm cooking something it makes me feel more invested in the meal. Okay um so if i'm not doing that it feels like i'm just not trying. Okay, so you know that I get spun down that rabbit hole of feeling lesser than."
528.0,Provider,"Right so and I think we kind of touched upon this a little bit last week about just you know. Like kind of I know we at least breezed over the topic of self compassion and I don't think we really talked too much into it, but like I like this feels like a really perfect opportunity to like maybe practice a little bit of self compassion with this thought that you're having."
13868.0,Patient,True. i'm just not good at it yet.
528.0,Provider,"Well yeah I mean maybe because I don't know if Have you ever had a conversation with anybody around like kind of how do you do self compassion, or what does that even look like or like has that ever been something you've read about or talked about or."
13868.0,Patient,Not that stuck out that I couldn't recall right now.
528.0,Provider,"yeah so maybe you know if you want, we can kind of spend a little bit of time on that so that that's can be a skill that you start to practice more often. Because I do think it is a really, really, really important tool when in recovery, I mean even outside of recovery it's extremely valuable, but especially for recovery where that critical voice, you know that. Eating disorder voice is like just trying to like tell you what to do and tell you you're not good enough and all the all the mean things right. So we in order to like counter that you have to find that nurturing voice that's some more more kind voice that more. compassionate voice right and use that to talk back to the the mean voice right, so I mean the first step is always like noticing oh yeah there's that you know there's that critical there's the inner critic right there's the. The bully or there's Edna or whatever he I don't know you know, whoever he want to call it, you know, whatever, but just kind of recognizing that you know okay there's that mean voice and then um so one of the like simplest ways, I think, to start practicing self compassion is like. Thinking about like how you might talk to like your daughter or a or somebody that you really care about you know, or you know anybody. friend your husband family member does anybody like if let's say I don't know let's say maybe your daughter like if she were coming to you. What if she said the same thing to you like I don't know what if she was like. You know mom I really you know I ate this food for dinner, but I really wanted to make something and. i'm feeling really bad about it, I feel like I should have like put more time into it and you know, and I am just filling makes me feel really bad and guilty or just like not like a good daughter, or something you know what would you say to her like How would you respond."
13868.0,Patient,"I will try to figure out what made her feel that way like. um you know if there was something that I had said at some point to make her feel yucky. About that particular scenario. And then tell her that it's okay that it's not about. You know, making everybody happy, I guess, or. Even even impressing people it's just about. nurturing yourself like like you said nurturing yourself with food it doesn't matter where it where it came from, or or whatever just tell her that it's not her fault. You know, in her particular case they'd be try again next time. or whatever."
528.0,Provider,"yeah yeah they'd like there's always another time you know this isn't the only meal of the week or the your life, you know, like there's other meals and. yeah and so so How does that feel when you say those words out loud like as if you're talking to your daughter like How does that feel to you know I wonder."
13868.0,Patient,compassionate because I visualize her face and how she would her Facebook look if she was telling those mean things to herself. So just like a flood of can want a hugger.
528.0,Provider,"yeah and how, how do you think or maybe another way to look at this is. Has anybody can you can you think of a time when somebody has spoke compassionately to you or offered kindness to you when you were struggling. If you can think of a specific example, or just."
13868.0,Patient,"yeah my husband's really good at it, I mean. offering the facetime me. When i'm eating just are eating that meal together, whatever the eastern which. he's not a technologically advanced guy or anything. it's been on the phone already so that's a huge. loving thing for him to do, and I would do it. While I would do it for everybody, but. So. it's just hard to turn that inward and do it for myself."
528.0,Provider,yeah but how does that feel when he's acting that way towards you.
13868.0,Patient,"Initially it feels uncomfortable awkward like I don't feel I don't feel like you don't have to go that far i'm fine. Okay. Does it feel like. I don't feel worthy of it. And I guess that's a fact I just don't feel worthy of it, I don't know i've not ever had somebody love me truly unconditionally like he does. mm hmm he, like even my children, but not in the like my children a hateful but children push back that's what they do."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"I always felt like you know I gave birth to you, your fruit of my uterus so you have to love me like I can't. break that. Right, but with him it's weird because, since this is both of our second marriage we've seen it break before. yeah so it's always that in the back of my head like I don't want to be too much and push him too far and break it so when he offers to do something that's out of his comfort zone and it's because he loves me I think there's a silent. Like scorecard being kept, I have no proof of that."
528.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"My head that's how I feel and so i'm worried that it's like. I don't want to push him too far, I guess."
528.0,Provider,Okay okay.
13868.0,Patient,"Like push him to the limits of how much can you give me. At some point, I have to like pick up and go on my own."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah.
13868.0,Patient,weird it's a awkward balance but.
528.0,Provider,"yeah um so there's a little bit of like. I mean, I want to say. The right word um I don't know, maybe protection that's the word those cummings my mind like like protecting your yourself like from being cared for like you know, like it's like almost guard it, I think, is what I mean like. You know. you're a little bit it's like you don't want to let your guard down even though he's showing you like kindness and like wants to be there for you, but like sounds like part of me is like you know a little bit guarded around that. kind of what you mean."
13868.0,Patient,"yeah that would be accurate. And it's like I said, I have no proof of that that's mine that i'm. inventing I guess because he's not said or done anything to make me think it's unconditional nor would I with him. yeah so it's weird that that is there. and specifically around food because food is something that we thoroughly enjoy together."
528.0,Provider,hmm.
13868.0,Patient,"I mean, he he's an adventurous eater i'm an adventurous eater are we go to Vegas Vegas is our favorite place to go, but when we go, we Center our days around but new place we're going to go or to eat or what old favorite and what crazy thing, are we going to eat, this time. yeah so The irony is not lost on me. That that's our I always say it's our love language but I mean. it's not it's just so weird that I struggle with it so hard with him because it's also such a positive thing for us. Right i'm afraid of. Maybe i'm afraid of him take thinking that i'm faking it why don't we go and eat together. But I don't know weird has a new. write that down."
528.0,Provider,"I know for sure. D. Do you do feel any and I don't know, maybe your husband's that sounds like there's Maybe other layers i'm not sure, but like. Like when when somebody. speaks kindly to you or shows they really care about you does a part of you and, and this may not be true, but i'm just wondering is a part of you feel like. A little bit of relief kind of or just like a little bit of warmth and you like okay like or does it do you kind of I don't know if maybe maybe your your immediate reaction is like to like hard enough and kind of like I said, be guarded like it. up. that's one it's okay that's interesting okay."
13868.0,Patient,i'm always like why. Like it just like you said carded.
528.0,Provider,"yeah so. Okay let's let's put it spin it a different way to is like when you let's go back to your daughter like when you, you know talk to her in that way, that you would if she's struggling How does that make you feel."
13868.0,Patient,"Warm like. Like I don't feel like it's conditional with her, I mean I I talk trash about her being 15 and that's frustrating, but at the end of the day, I know that she loves me unconditionally. yeah and vice versa, so when she does something guys, or vice versa there's not that like what do you want or. there's I don't guard anything with her."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
13868.0,Patient,As far as that you know love giving and receiving goes.
528.0,Provider,"yeah does it feel good for you to like you know speak kindly to her like to kind of suit her like kind of make her you know. You know, feel feel better when she's struggling does it does that feel like good in your heart like where your mind to."
13868.0,Patient,Do that definitely definitely.
528.0,Provider,yeah.
13868.0,Patient,It makes me feel good to love other people. all the time. That receipt of it that I don't. I don't quite know how to take it. yeah know what to do with it.
528.0,Provider,"i'm i'm just making a note to because I feel like that might be a good thing. Maybe to explore with I free, are you with halina or Catherine, you know with."
13868.0,Patient,My note to.
528.0,Provider,"um yeah I think that I feel like that would be a good thing to explore with her. Definitely. But yeah I mean, because that will help because if you're having a hard time accepting kindness from others right like I can understand why it's hard to turn that around on you right and like. For your you know, using this whole idea of self compassion, which is basically like kindness towards yourself and like and it's also about just making space for. Like kind of mistakes and the sounds you know it's like it's the it loosens the perfectionism you know it doesn't like it's like. And the rules and the rigidity kind of you know so going back to your example I think we kind of took a left turn on this, because you were talking about how having that lunch table. You know, felt, you were feeling bad about doing that because you kind of like had this expectation for yourself that you should you should be. You know, preparing a meal for like from scratch, or you know, or like you just you know put more effort into it, but yet you opted for like the convenient option right and so um. So yeah I can see why so I don't know I mean i'm maybe not sure any of what we've talked about like if you could like maybe right now, maybe just think about a compassionate response in this moment for that particular. situation."
13868.0,Patient,"I guess it would be. The easy way out, would have been to just not eat at all, and I did nourish myself. And nourishment comes in the form of convenient and Julia child level cooking that the nutritional value is still there and I chose to love myself by eating. As opposed to beat myself up by not eating."
528.0,Provider,"I love that so much I love it you chose to take care of yourself in whatever form it was available to you or convenient to you in that moment you just but you that was what needed to be done, and you did it and that's, the important thing."
13868.0,Patient,"I feel so weird it just feels so foreign to me to be nice to myself about it, like or be proud of me, you know what I mean. I don't know I, I am proud of me for the steps i've made so far in the Program. And I you know I look forward to constantly being challenged and digging deep and like. healing my mind, and my body. it's just it's it's shocking to me that how much i'm learning about myself."
528.0,Provider,um.
13868.0,Patient,And it's it's intriguing to push further and figure out. You know what the next step is like what healing looks like or recovery itself looks like. yeah kind of kind of motivate it's hard but it's motivating to. To keep going.
528.0,Provider,"that's awesome that's I love that yeah I mean. Because you're you know you're taking this seriously and I mean then you're really putting a lot of work in and it shows and you're getting all it sounds like you're getting a lot out of it too and. You know, and you know that there's more to even learn even you know even in this moment you're like I know there's more ago right so in a positive way, like it's like you know that there's more to learn about yourself that's exciting."
13868.0,Patient,Thank you.
528.0,Provider,"um so yeah I mean again this isn't this isn't something that you know you're going to get overnight right but um I mean hopefully just having the conversation around this or maybe recognizing you know when when you could use it, for example, or how you could use self compassion. You know, might maybe this week, you can start to pay attention to just again just even if you don't you don't use the tool like even if you just notice oh there's that. You know, inner critic or there's that Edna there whenever you and I noticed in your log you did you did kind of make notes about at night, and like how she. was trying to be loud, but you were able to I kind of shut her up. And so, so you know it's kind of like that, but like again towards your like using kindness towards yourself like you know, using words that can be supportive. And not that are going to bring you down. And so yeah just recognizing when that critical voice is showing up and then maybe even. You know practicing whatever you're able to do like using that self compassion voice."
13868.0,Patient,that's all doable.
528.0,Provider,And I mean. It might be dead let's like maybe we can come up with like a concrete thing for you to do this week to week in terms of. Like maybe pick like three. three critical voice. statements that you notice and then come up with at least one for each like compassionate way statements.
13868.0,Patient,Okay.
528.0,Provider,What do you think about.
13868.0,Patient,"Just thinking about what Edna says, you know what I mean like it's so funny because I think for so long she's had a running dialogue, like a constant blabbering the now that i'm trying to pick the her favorites it's hard to. it's hard to put together which one or which ones would be like. The most hurtful, I guess, and the, obviously, the one that comes to mind is. You know don't eat that you're fat already or you're too fat it always results in fat and fat is bad. Okay, and that's something that i've always been always but been trying to work on, on my own. that the word fat is like you have brown eyes or whatever like it's just an adjective it's not a description or is it negative, I mean, let me take that back, it is a description, but it's not an emotion it's not bad there's no negative connotation to it. So fighting against that, like in my brain is hard. Because I would never look at anybody else and tell them that they're fat and that's bad."
528.0,Provider,Right.
13868.0,Patient,"I don't even I don't even look at people like that, but when it comes to me it's like the ultimate. what's the word the opposite of a compliment."
528.0,Provider,insult.
13868.0,Patient,"insult you Oh, my goodness i'm i'm telling you this stroke of insight book The more I read it, the more my language is getting jack."
528.0,Provider,Oh no.
13868.0,Patient,"it's Okay, maybe the more i'm like Okay, with my language being jacked up is. A better way to put it, but anyways um. I don't know like that's such a weird thing for me to think about because the compassionate part would be. fat isn't bad like take the wind out of the sails as far as that goes."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"You know fat is a scientific fact like it is a thing it's i've seen it with the surgeries and stuff like it's it is what it is. So I gotta figure out how to reframe I guess how she like what does that mean like Okay, which is hard."
528.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13868.0,Patient,we're too fat.
528.0,Provider,"yeah and you picked a really hard one to that is. Because like there's so much to unpack with that word fat, you know I mean you know it's yeah. And also, you know in that statement don't eat that you're going to get fat or you are a fat is like also you know there's a tie or belief that what you eat is makes you fat too. Right and."
13868.0,Patient,"And the weird part is it's like instantaneous in your head, I can be hungry. And I eat something that knows like oh you're going to get five, and I feel fat the next second. Logically, obviously, that can't happen."
528.0,Provider,For sure yeah.
13868.0,Patient,But then suddenly i'm like hyper aware like oh my gosh I can feel my chin on my neck and things that happen all the time anyways. yeah. Then all of a sudden i'm just hyper conscious of it.
528.0,Provider,"Now that's interesting exactly yeah I mean it's good that you have that logical side of you that knows that that's impossible, like you, don't just gain fat like that in a second or in a day or anything like that you know and one food that you eat. is not going to make you fat that just doesn't there's no proof of that like um so yeah. yeah So these are the, so this is actually tied into i'm realizing as we're talking so some of this self compassion is also tied into like you know. I mean, I know we I think part of your homework for last like for this week, but from last week was to like kind of notice the food roles are like the. You know yeah like the voice in your head the negative voice in your head or the food rules right the food police kind of they're all kind of like tied together in the sense of that just that, like. That I mean it's all tied to the eating disorder, but again using that like self compassion can be one thing you can use but also like logic and like evidence, you know facts can also be helpful, like in the moment you know. So I just wanted to say that there's lots of it's not so it's not just so self compassion is one piece of it, like the way you talk about it and, like again making room for like. Like if you make a mistake, or you know that it's not such a black and white way of thinking, but there's also like you know other ways to kind of challenge that as well, I don't know if that was helpful but yeah just wanted yeah. yeah so and I mean that you've probably heard this before, just like in general and eating disorder recovery that the like a big part of the work is really just. Like lowering the volume on Edna or whatever, or like and and using and that healthy self that you have. that's like that's where the self compassionate self lies right and so that that needs to get stronger and, like everyone needs to basically go away and like it just or just at least decrease the volume on her."
13868.0,Patient,increase the self compassion voice.
528.0,Provider,Any. So yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"Thinking of a food roles, or the police um. it's hard for me to narrow down what they are, because they are so there's so many of them."
528.0,Provider,"hmm okay i'm glad you yeah. So you know what I will. I have like this. it's like a quiz but it's like a list of questions that can help to kind of. Direct you in terms of thinking of, like some of these food rules. So that's why I can send that to you if that would be helpful. Like it'll be like. Actually, let me see if I can pull it up real quick. Sorry. Okay, so weird my mouse is not. Like i'm clicking on something and it's like not clicking Okay, what the heck. Like you're. Like clicking on something and it's not clicking where I want it to, and so I can't open what I hear here we go okay I got it. Alright, so i'll just share my screen, so you can see, but like I said oh awesome awesome this to you. Okay, so i'm. Just these kind of questions like do you count anything what determines how much you eat, what do you consider healthy eating. Do you have any rules about what time of day, it is okay to eat, do you have any rules about snacking or meals, are there any foods you try to avoid. Do you have any rules about knowing the nutrition content of a meal or food, do you eat differently if there are other people do you compare what you eat other people do you have any rules around beverages, do you have any rules around exercise. What do you think about carbs sweets I would probably add in there, fats um. Do you weigh or measure your food what feels safe to eat, so I don't know if these questions. Might kind of get you thinking more about what were what were your Rules are."
13868.0,Patient,or yeah I love that. kind of gives me a direction.
528.0,Provider,"um and it's kind of like yes, no but like I would kind of take it like, especially if you say yes, like so, in other words, if you answer yes, do you count anything. Like kind of dig deeper you know court so like think okay what what do I count, why do I count, you know kind of or just like No, sorry you don't even have to go there, just like what do I count like what's your rule around that like what is the or what's the belief um. You know if you say what determines how much okay like so some of the ones that are yes now like, do you have any rules about what time of day is okay to eat, so if that's true, then kind of like state what your role is. That make sense."
13868.0,Patient,yeah absolutely.
528.0,Provider,Okay i'll send this to you.
13868.0,Patient,Thank you.
528.0,Provider,"yeah, of course. yeah we can definitely come back to that next time. And I would say. Like well, I was already said you're already you did it you're doing a great job with eating the meals and snacks. And how are you feeling about that."
13868.0,Patient,"I feel feel good about it, I think that i'm. just looking at it right now. I like being able to like log everything in one place like I don't know if you saw I put my DDT."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"diary things in there and that's been super helpful to like have it all in one central location. was given the opportunity to have it spread everywhere and I won't be able to find it again and having it literally, since I have to have my phone on me anyways for work and kids and all the rest of it, it holds me more accountable and I paying attention to it in one place. Right, so I like that a lot and I was trying to I was thinking about putting. Oh gosh I can't think and do things at the same time. or talking to do things at the. same time well sometimes think anyways i'm trying to find a place to log like when Edna speaks up like how I respond to that. Okay, so if something weird pops up that's where it came from."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, now I mean you were trying to figure out is that what you said or."
13868.0,Patient,yeah like because under goals you know you can add I can add other goals.
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13868.0,Patient,"Which is where I put the DVD thing. i'm wondering if there's something similar for. Like the thought, maybe the dysfunctional thought record."
528.0,Provider,"Oh, do you see, I see mine is different than yours, so you might be seeing things. Oh wow that's cool um."
13868.0,Patient,So under the like when I click check in and then thoughts I get I don't know if you can see. It get to options here.
528.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
13868.0,Patient,dysfunctional thought that might be a good place.
528.0,Provider,that's perfect yeah that seems like a great place to put that.
13868.0,Patient,asking you shall receive.
528.0,Provider,"that's great. And then is there, like another place to put like a counter thought. You don't have to do that I. mean if you just acknowledge it, but like like I said I said just come up with three like I guess critical voice statements or dysfunctional thoughts or whatever for this week, but if you wanted to choose three and then put it in there, I guess you cutters put it on a separate. piece of you know document or whatever."
13868.0,Patient,I can do that.
528.0,Provider,"All right, well um. you're all set and then what was your assignment for today for group."
13868.0,Patient,"Remember me find it. Actually easier, right here. Right two or more health goals that are not weight centric, in other words, they are goals that have nothing to do with body shape or size. And then the challenge food something picked up from fast food place or Deli. So my goals are to. Oh, my gosh regain and maintain flexibility in my hips. Okay, and then the second one is to. Again gain and maintain a sleep. routine that doesn't require like taking benadryl or melatonin or anything."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, good I like those. i'm going to also i'd like you to because you have a little bit of time before now and and group is come up with one nutrition goal, but not like the most so you know it could be literally anything um. You know, could be. to challenge the eating disorder voice, or it could be, you know, to increase the variety of food or you know, whatever is important to you, but i'm. Just so that you have at least one like sort of nutrition related goal in there, too, I think, would be good, but the other ones are awesome as well. All right, and do you know what you're going to bring for group."
13868.0,Patient,I don't have any idea.
528.0,Provider,you'll figure it out.
13868.0,Patient,"I found this is weird, but I just remembered where i'm at in lubbock and I whenever I get my tattoos are always at the same person and he also owns a tavern next door to it, so they have, like all these crazy hipster hot dogs and stuff so I might go grab one of those because elisha. Nice and he's close."
528.0,Provider,"That sounds perfect yeah. All right, well anything else."
13868.0,Patient,I don't think so I was looking at my schedule next week and it's pretty ridiculous I really only have all day Tuesday.
528.0,Provider,Okay. um let's see.
13868.0,Patient,All the other time I have I have literally have meetings.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so I."
13868.0,Patient,root for.
528.0,Provider,"I think I can do, I might be able to do 10 o'clock oh that's my time 10 o'clock in the morning. and say. But I. let's just let's just say that for now I have somebody there I think we're canceling I just have to confirm, so that appointments cancelled, then I can put you in there. So, but let's just say yes, and if you don't hear from me, then that means it's good if obviously i'll reach out if it's a problem."
13868.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good to me that's 11 o'clock my time right."
528.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's good. All right, um Okay, well, I will see you in about an hour and. i'm glad we got to figure it all. figured out your plan for tonight, for the rest of the. Next, three days."
13868.0,Patient,"To Thank you so much, I feel so good about it."
528.0,Provider,awesome no problem i'll see you soon.
13868.0,Patient,All righty bye.
