5393.0,Patient,"around like the first week of September I started on the lithium the two. yeah two at nighttime one in the morning, which will consist of. You know 600 milligrams at nighttime and then the daily 300 the one in the morning it's been almost a month and. Just you know, in a nutshell. Like I was telling amanda that. i'm really a different person and looking back at things I journaled about like few months ago, and I was really in the darkness and it's like wow I don't feel that when life's not perfect, but. This is something that has given me a new quality of life. You know, maybe perhaps like I forget his name like Fernando or something so that you know really the lithium can super support the Olympics all during the day, and it really is, I can feel that so and I got my lab."
298.0,Provider,yeah I did I just.
5393.0,Patient,I my biggest side effects are tremors but for me like as long as I don't have some fucked up pts. If all I have her tremors like the benefit is better.
298.0,Provider,You can tell that you are not a stranger to medications and side effects.
5393.0,Patient,"I pay i'm really in tune with my body, and this is what like all of this for me, I do it for me, but what makes me happy is. Having the quality of life in relationships like you know, realizing the damage i've done before medication and just struggling is just horrible. And so, a big motivating factor for me is like the more I do that the better my relationships are and it's really rewarding so I was 10 hours ahead last month when I started taking it in Europe and I made this whole like how to take the meds like I took them us time that day."
298.0,Provider,And I was like.
5393.0,Patient,My friend forgot to take his he takes one medication he forgot and i'm on like you know decent amount so that was like that right there is my accomplishment like and.
298.0,Provider,"i'm impressed I have traveled the world and I get so lost in time zones, I wouldn't know what day to speak limits."

You know, but. But I two times about this like is is my goal and everyone's awesome so I need to be more disciplined about the in the medication helps but other than i've been you know pretty proud of myself so and as long as the labs are fine. And I don't want to go up until I need to so yeah I just feel I feel like I get now why people were at the fountain of lithium know. it's it. felt like. I thought it was so normal to feel like you want to kill yourself, like so many days and it's like not like I I feel. yeah like wow."
298.0,Provider,"I think in two weeks, my husband and I are taking a. vacation well just a weekend, because we have this my daughters getting married next weekend, so the following weekend to reward my husband and I for all the work that we put in because it's on our property, the wedding. i'm thinking that i'm gonna go over to ashland and drink their water and sit in their natural hot springs and just then."

298.0,Provider,"So here's the deal labs are important, and the only thing I didn't want to do is have you be toxic and you're not toxic so that's that's what I wanted. i'm not willing to go up on your lap on your medicine, even though it shows that we could face. But your symptoms don't tell me that you have and that's where expertise comes in, so if you start feeling down, and I know that the labs show you could take a little more I think right, then we would go up, but right now we're fine you have. and love mctell supporting you also for a mood stabilizer."
