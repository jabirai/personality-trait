Let the virtual clinic now so they check you in so you don't get a no show for this session. yeah I wanted to ask you what was going on, last week I got a message that you wanted to me, but then they had to cancel it because you had group that same day."
13184.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm just the custody hearing so. yeah I was seeing if I was if we I can have a one on one. But yeah the group is more like people are just talking about their anxiety. That they have so. yeah and it's Dr steps trying to ask them like is their medication working out. So honestly it just kind of stresses me out to hear everybody else talking about all their problems.
148.0,Provider,"Oh, oh okay so you're not finding."
13184.0,Patient,support and you have to go to it. And if you want suboxone refill so it's just like you have to.
148.0,Provider,But if it's not a good fit for you um. Would you want to switch groups do you want to.
13184.0,Patient,"Well there's another group, but the other group starts at 6pm on Wednesdays and that's when I pick up my daughter."
148.0,Provider,So it's just I can't gotcha okay.
13184.0,Patient,"Doc there. Okay, if there's another group that you know about. That would be cool."
148.0,Provider,What is the group that you're in what is.
13184.0,Patient,it's an anxiety group.
148.0,Provider,"And, but 90 specific."
13184.0,Patient,"yeah and then i'm. Like so I kinda want to start talking about what's going on in my life right now. Like if we can pivot to that um. So. I talked to you about the custody hearings and all that right and i'm like I know we've talked about like. stuff that i've lived through like my childhood and you mentioned like you know different things to help you cope. And then, like watching that netflix docs on accountability. But yeah i'm just having like kind of a rough time. Like i'm with this custody and with my. With the judge and the mediator. it's the mediator, like, I think I told you how that went. And I had court last week and. um did I tell you like originally what I thought it was or not what I thought, but i'm like what my daughter told me like she was. Basically molested by her mom's boyfriend."
148.0,Provider,"did not come in, then."
13184.0,Patient,"yeah I guess i'm just like embarrassed or ashamed to like talk about that so um she told me in February that. Like yeah she told me that mom's boyfriend. Like rubbed her vagina when mom was in the shower. And then um. You know she was acting very strange, and so I was telling her look only mommy and Daddy see you like, with your clothes off mommy mommy and Daddy wash you. Nobody else and she'll say, well, what about grandma and i'm like yeah if you're at grandma's house okay um but. yeah she was acting strange and like doing weird things like putting her stuffed animals to her private area. And so I you know I thought that that was up, and you know. It was, I think it was like the. super bowl Sunday weekend. I remember because her, and I was just hanging out the House, I think we got a pizza. And um you know I told her like I always tell you could tell me anything i'll never like get mad at you for anything you tell me, I always listen and so you know she did tell me that. What happened, you know, and you know at first I didn't believe, like not they didn't believe her I didn't believe that that was possible."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
13184.0,Patient,And so. yeah she um. But you know I saw I call the COPs and they sent to Mel COPs out to question her and. didn't like.
148.0,Provider,your daughter.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah so you know right away, I asked him, can you send out a female and they're you know they're like we'll see but they send out like these two like you know my size kind of big six foot one 200 pounds mental like beat COPs and these guys don't have any. Like they're not trained and how to talk to a kid. Like that you know. So they don't they they come in my house and they asked her you know what's your name she knows her name how old, are you she knows how old's. Then they say, do you know who Victor is she looks at me and she gets scared and she runs over to me. And you know I sat her down, and I said look Penelope you're going to have to tell them before they came I see you have to tell them what you told me what happened. But I didn't like sit her down the hammer and in tour, I was like look penny you're going to tell them exactly what you told me and I didn't like. I guess I should have done that, like sat down and said look tell me what you're going to tell them. I just taught set at once, I was like look. you're going to have to do this you're gonna have to tell them. Victor molested you when mommy was in the shower he told you scratching your belly but he was rubbing your vagina and so um you know any told her like monsters are coming he pulled like he pulled on your mermaid shirt she was saying, like ripped it. And so. yeah I didn't sit her down it and explain like you have to do, I just said, you know okay they're coming here you're gonna have to tell them what you told me so you know they asked her name house, yes, do you know Victor she clams up and they leave and that's it. And then they stand, so I call CPS I tell them like I think like the next day, so this is what happened, they sent the COPs out CPS was like and also, I have a video of her saying what happened. So I give that to the police I tell the CPS like I tell them about the video in there they're like. You know it's too vague it's too vague. And if the COPs aren't looking into it we're not going to look into it. wow and so you know that was so that's that right there, and when the COPs are told about sat down with the child, they automatically have to tell CPS. So right, then you know I call the COPs they they they call CPS and then I call CPS and then, so I tried to get her into her doctor like that same week, this is like February 8 ninth and the doctor I go to the doctor and the doctors like. Oh sorry and she's been going this doctor, since she was a newborn I mean her first doctor and they're like okay so for some reason she's she's not on our insurance she can't come here. And like okay i'll pay you guys cash Oh, we can't accept cash like that's illegal I like what like it's just like you know it was like it was just like a never ending like. it's ridiculous I you know I see why so many of like that happens all the time, and it goes unreported and it's almost impossible to prove because the people that. you're trying to help you are very incompetent and they don't know what they're doing we let like shitty people into positions, the power, you know excuse my language, or like. You know, like the COPs like the doctor, you know, and this is Saturday telling me we can't even accept your money it's illegal um. yeah it's just like those people, you know they probably have no business being in the position they're in so I bring this up to the judge in February I tell the judge hey look. You know this is what's going on, because police they did tell me talk to the judge and I called some psychologists like that worked with kids specifically and sexual abuse and the they told me like. Make sure you tell this to the judge and make the judge put in order, for her to talk to a therapist, and so I tell the judge and the judge, just like. You didn't file the right papers I can't talk to you about that here right now in open court she's like no, you know we're not discussing that. So it's like Okay, so I come back, I found the right papers I I think I the next court dates like April 19, so this is already two months later, you know um it was a no go at the doctor um it was a no go for CPS police know the judges like no I can't listen to you. Because you didn't you know you didn't check the right box, but I talked to other like people down at the courthouse and they said. yeah you could the judges supposed to like the judge is supposed to listen to you and try to help you out like even if you didn't check the right boxes um so. yeah it's just like it's so I get in front of her and April and the judges like. You know she doesn't even like I did thought the right forms, I did check the right boxes and she she won't like she won't talk she won't let me like bring that up she's too busy talking about other stuff like that's not even important just kind of like. You know, like, I told you before like you know your 30 day you know no college education, I don't know what mom hopes to get from you i'm just like going in on me. I don't know why I, I mean I I think she just racist I mean I can't think of anything else because I was polite towards her, I mean towards the end of this was in April of her like talk to me like that I did like kind of roll my eyes, but this is after like. Two court dates of her just like ignoring me and like putting me down. You know so. This is like April and the judge she won't hear it, so I I fill out more papers and I turn them in and we get to like June. And she's like the judges like so Sir you're saying your daughter was molested. And you know, this is all an open court there's other people there's the bailiff everybody's listening everybody can hear and she's like. i'm you know you don't make those allegations and what is, what are you doing talking to your doctor about this, why is she even talking about that i'm like Oh, excuse me, I i'm sorry i'm a little confused i'm taking back I you know I you know I said. Like i'm i'm trying to get you to help me i'm trying to get you to let me take my daughter to a therapist and she's like. You know you you shouldn't even be talking to your daughter about that, and you definitely should not be taking her to a therapist and it's like. You know so she. So, and then I was able to get her my daughter into her regular doctor. In the beginning of August find me and I, you know we're talking it's the wild child checkup and the doctors like. You know what's going on, so I tell them what happened in February, you know, and I did tell him like hey I tried to get her in here, and you guys were like wouldn't even let me pay you guys to see her and they're like you know, unfortunately, when you call CPS it's not the same as us. we're sorry we're very sorry we're going to alert CPS to what's going on. And, and they did so that was like the third time CPS was alerted I called them police call them and then doctors call them, so the mediator puts in the report in September. Nicholas with our father is promoting daughter is being sexually abused like and the way he put it was like i'm out here like screaming like. You know, like i'm promoting it that and that's what the judge said last week, like you need to stop promoting this you're going and it's like wait a minute. You know, like I didn't tell you this, but she knows how the system where she knows I call the COPs they call CPS I call CPS so that's two times. Because the mediator put in the report, like. He listed all the times CPS was contacted and they know that i'm not sitting there doing it every time they know I call them once. And then you know when when COPs when doctors are alerted to it by law, they have to and the mediator and the judge knows this, but they rather just play stupid or just give me a hard time and they're like. You know that's you need to stop doing that Nick and it's like and then the judge went on to say so, you know the mom could call CPS tomorrow and say father is abusing the child, how would you like that it's like they're not supposed to be picking the side like that so. I mean it's just hard I you know the judge by wall she's supposed to be unbiased she's not supposed to tell me hey. mom could do this tomorrow and make you look like you're doing something it's like right like she's given her the like okay yeah it's like. Like they're ganging up on me the judges like with her like she's you know and and mom yeah she's to blame, but this mediator this judge like they're just as much to blame is anyone in this situation, so you know um. yeah let's kind of let's kind of just like the shortest way I can say all that."
148.0,Provider,wow you've been holding on to all the February.
13184.0,Patient,"I mean you know I talked to my parents about it and friends, but there's only so much you know and they're not they don't have any way to tell me like you know they do help, but I don't know like ever since last week, like you know I felt like this, like. i'm like at a breaking point."
148.0,Provider,course have you spoken to not be mom.
13184.0,Patient,"She says, you told her to say that. And even if you didn't tell her to say that, why would you be bringing it up again like you know. She she has two sons, we used to live together for three years, I saw her slap her son's across the face, I saw her pick one of them up and running around like a rag doll so she's a violent person. And she'll never admit to this stuff in port I seen I like I saw her, she broke, one of my TVs she broke mirrors she those plates she's buying it so like Of course I brought it up to her, but she's not going to i'm like she doesn't want to lose custody of her kids. I mean for how kind of bad of a parent she is she still loves them in our own like twisted way you know, even though they're like a distant. distant third like they're behind her they're behind whoever she's dating they're behind her needs or wants like after all that comes her kids but yeah I did try to share it, you know with the mom is she just saying you know. Why. You know, you told her to say that."
148.0,Provider,Everybody is kind of making it out as. you're the bad guy in this situation.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah I i'm the one because I came forward, you know, because you know, so I don't know what to do."
148.0,Provider,Have you talked to Penelope anymore about it.
13184.0,Patient,"No, I mean the other day. She brought up the CPS lady and she's like hey the CPS ladies, my friend, I, like her, she is a CPS she's like you know the lady that came here she went to my mom's. she's my friend, and I said okay penny that's good, and so this was like Friday morning and I said you're going to have to tell her what happened at your marks and she said. Victor touched my butt and he said he was sorry he's a good guy so mom is like instilling to enter like. brainwashing her Victor touched your leg, and he says sorry he's a good guy and you know I, this morning I got an email from her mom because in court, I asked, can we use a family wizard out I don't know if you know what that is. it's a way. To like talk."
148.0,Provider,communicate yeah.
13184.0,Patient,"Because with texts is just like person one person's like you know it whatever we we argue too much, I guess, through tax so they're like you know she brings up email I rena family wizard, of course, the judges that to do whatever she wants. And like I was just like one more thing with the Court and the judge, like last week. mom is felt the pickup Penelope a whole year, she doesn't pick her up on Mondays at 8am like she's supposed to. It says in a custody order you don't do that, like you, don't pick up when you're supposed to you that's non conformance like you will lose your parental rights so she goes into court, the other day and he's like. yeah I I, I have a hard time picking up Penelope or she's not ready when I sit, when I need to pick her up basically she'll text me and say niche. have a ready at 8am so text me at 740 i'll be like hey she's still asleep, but as soon as you get here so be out there, but she doesn't even come to pick her up no show and the judge I tell the judge that and the judges like no okay you take her to drop her off at. Childcare at 8pm on Mondays or mom gets what she's asking for and she'll get child at 730 on Sunday night. So, because she feels to pick her up it's my fault and i'm added the site so that's just like one more thing I just like wanting to it but yeah like going back to that other thing is just like. i'm just feel like you know i'm at a loss, I don't know what to do. I like and then it's like I like I can't stop thinking about it i'm unlike obsessing over it."
148.0,Provider,"it's painful. And the fact that you have no control over this, I mean. i'm so sorry Nick."
13184.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. yeah I just don't know what to do, anymore, as far as like with that, I mean, originally a dispatcher when I called the COPs said. If it was me, it was a lady dispatcher she's like you need to if it was me, I would just go to the district attorney like I bring my own case to this district attorney so maybe I should have did that I just keep going over in my head like. You know what could I have done different I should have like shattered."
148.0,Provider,"What do you mean I should have done, that is, it too late to do that now."
13184.0,Patient,"I mean look at how i'm being treated like if I was to do that, it would be like i'm i'm promoting it like um."
148.0,Provider,"Have you documented everything from that first conversation with Penelope to the COPs to. CPS to the doctor to the judge, are you documenting."
13184.0,Patient,"yeah it's all documented, I mean like I have the notes. That dates."
148.0,Provider,You know ever stop doing that.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah I could keep doing it, but it's not going to matter I mean it it doesn't matter honestly. yeah. That person who did it, he is never going to face justice for it. You know yeah it doesn't really matter. yeah."
148.0,Provider,I mean. You have to keep doing what you can do right.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I feel like i've done everything advanced on so."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah I mean you have you've done a lot.
13184.0,Patient,yeah so.
148.0,Provider,But that's a lot that you're carrying right now and that's a lot. yeah I can the frustration and the pain around this is really. Intense.
13184.0,Patient,"I mean like you know it's what's stopping mom's new boyfriend from doing it is what i'm thinking like chances are like she's not gonna like. there's not two pedophiles in a row, like, I mean just like probability statistics but."
148.0,Provider,This person isn't still with.
13184.0,Patient,"No he's not. On June and June like June 28. And they spent a day with him, and it was a day I picked her up a Wednesday, later on, that evening my day and she was screaming and crying. And at the same time, pulling down her pants and like trying to rub her button on me and it's just like I tell all this to the mother and she is just like. Stop it stop it there that's not true it's like here's the video of her screaming and crying. And psych she's fine every other Wednesday when I picked her up you know, for the most part, she doesn't act like that, so now, if you had to go around a person that did that tour, and you know she was like deeply disturbed by it. But you know no mom isn't still with him she's with the new person. But like you know one psychologist I talked to on the phone when I was trying to find one to get her into and like I told you in California both parents need to agree on therapy so ours, you can't bring the kids but they said, you know, like. Like yeah mom's judgment doesn't seem that good you know what happens when the next person does it and the next person. I mean if this is why this keeps happening to kids, this is why you know it's impossible to prove like, how do you know how do I prove it it's impossible. um. yeah it's just you know I feel so bad for Penelope but what really bothers me even more. Is she's being told that I told her to say that, like she's being brainwashed. yeah I mean she's very smart and she's very articulate for being three like she'll speak in complete sentences. You know I know I always gosh over this to you I just been just like so miraculous but you know lucky for us that she does, and she can tell you what she's thinking and she can't tell you what happened. And you know mom never stopped and asked her mom just is telling her to say what she wants her to say, and you know our daughter knows this, our daughters probably afraid like I tell you when she comes to pick her up on Wednesday, or I mean whatever days she's getting her. Fridays or Mondays. cannot be doesn't want to go with her she's crying to stay with me, you know she does not want to go, you know, and I tell her your mom loves you so much. You know you're so pretty like your mommy that's why you're so pretty good it from your mommy I never talked down to her, there are times when because she'll come here and she'll not blow out on the door, and you know, can help you will be like. she'll like will just be hanging around the House and she'll go and show not it she'll be like someone's here, and if he wants to pretend i'm like it's you know, should be like you not hard and say mommy's here like she'll just want to do that, for some reason, and she told me. I told mom she knocks at the door really loud and she says she told me she doesn't knock and cannot be said why Why is he lying so Penelope knows like she knows a lie, she understands that you know. She she very, very smart like we her aunt. is like kind of like you, except she the fourth grade teacher she has like a Masters and child development and then another one in like. setting out so like another like she has two masters and she's a fourth grade teacher and she's like you know penalty is three but she's like you know, like a six year old how a five year old six year old how she talks how she like put stuff together."
148.0,Provider,"yeah it's incredible wow i'm Nick Unfortunately I have, I do have someone right after you today at 230 I did want to talk to you I got your request about changing. therapists. So I did want to talk to you about that we didn't get a chance to today. Do you want to set something up for later this week, so we can talk about this more. or yeah possibly."
13184.0,Patient,"What day, did you have a mind. yeah because, like i've told the people are bright heart like you know you're really great like it's like I, I have a kid and maybe like if I was talking to some like a parent I don't know if that would make a difference. Like someone that is like you know, like a 55 year old parent um okay yeah."
148.0,Provider,"yeah no I hear those concerns and trust me it's not something I take personal i've really enjoyed working with you, but I totally respect your decision, and you know, thank you for advocating for yourself and Community communicating your means. Because that's important this is your treatment right, this is your."
13184.0,Patient,"Well, I know that, like rarely ever in therapy is there that Aha moment like that rarely comes if ever, you know that's not really like I don't expect that. But yeah i've just like so much of who I am is like a dad and i'm like I don't know I guess just. Maybe like somebody that has a kid that kinda could understand that type of love because and understand like that type of. Like struggle to do like the right thing for your child and, like the doubt that you carry as a parent like am I doing the right thing, am I not doing the right thing, like you know. And I always thought people that you know talked about their kids and gosh Dover like they were just like fake but you know once I had one I definitely realize know like that's that's real you know."
148.0,Provider,"yeah, of course, of course, well Is this something that you want to have a longer conversation about or would you prefer me to put in a transfer to another therapist."
13184.0,Patient,"I mean, can I pick the can I see who, because if there's just a chance for me to like someone else like random, then I mean I just stay with you, but if it's like Look, we have this person this person this person which one would you want, then yeah I would be up for that."
148.0,Provider,"We can't really do that. But I have gotten to know you a little bit I can put in a request for somebody if their caseload is open, right now, I have a couple people in mind, and I think you would work really well with. been all the therapists and bright heart, you can trust they're good they're qualified therapists right so. it's up to you it's up to you and I know you shared a lot with me today, so I feel like Is this something you want to think about is this a longer conversation, you want to have do you want me to put in the transfer."
13184.0,Patient,"I mean it's like I said, like Am I ever going to have that Aha type of moment in therapy I don't know like do you ever get that with patients do you ever get like a person is like oh. Oh yeah that's so true like. Oh, my God I just realized does that happen calming."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah Of course I mean it takes time it's not something that happens overnight right but Nick I do have to go my my next patient is waiting in my way.
13184.0,Patient,"um yeah. yeah if you just want to put in a request for new one, one that you have in mind."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay um I will definitely do that and um. You know, I just want to say you are doing amazing work you are wonderful Father um. keep moving forward keep pushing keep advocating for you and your daughter, I mean I just the love that you have for her radiates off of you um.
