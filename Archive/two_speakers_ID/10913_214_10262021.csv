10913.0,Patient,"Sir, to mid Lynn how are you."
214.0,Provider,"i'm great, thank you for asking will stop me."
10913.0,Patient,"It basically means it's it's a weird messed that midwestern version of it could be better, it could be worse."
214.0,Provider,So very.
10913.0,Patient,empty House so it.
214.0,Provider,Be at the same time yeah yeah. So how's the medication working out you think.
10913.0,Patient,it's getting there you know i'm not feeling angry all the time.
214.0,Provider,Okay.
10913.0,Patient,yeah Does he know keeping taking it it's all you can do.
214.0,Provider,So do you. Do you think there's more for the medication to go on.
10913.0,Patient,well. So intel's gonna have to um or chantelle and I. are going to have to kind of go through and determine. How well the trailer is working and when. Would we be able to stop the zoloft and the seroquel.
214.0,Provider,when's your next appointment with her.
10913.0,Patient,I think it. Later later this week or the following week. To check my calendar.
214.0,Provider,yeah i'm gonna check it out for some curious for me to know. yeah i'm. So this says to me. You don't have anything with her.
10913.0,Patient,Oh. that's weird let me um.
214.0,Provider,there's nothing in the chart that indicates anything.
10913.0,Patient,"Okay um. let's see. Like I know when. Yours comes up. And i'm trying to see. Oh, my. I could have swore i'd set that up I guess i'll have to do that, after I get off the phone with you."
214.0,Provider,Okay yeah I would appreciate that because I think we need to figure out whether or not we getting old stuff we're on stuff. Right now what's what's the plan.
10913.0,Patient,"yeah and because I think I you know, even though I had that one week hiatus. Of a regular. I think it just basically went back into basically like full production mode in my system. So I want to figure out. What what and. When and how to. divert from the zoloft and the seroquel because, especially the result well actually both of them you can't just stop cold Turkey. You know there's some medications that. The doctor said oh it's okay to do that, while these two are not one of our those medications."
214.0,Provider,that's correct.
10913.0,Patient,"First, and fortunately with the zoloft instead of 200 i've been on 100 and there's a split in the middle, so be easy for me to drop it to. And with the seroquel also drop in."
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so we need to figure out because I think that's important and how we're going to move forward. it's kind of. i'm kind of going to be difficult, actually, without being able to know how to do that, you know."
10913.0,Patient,"Right and that's where the doctors expertise comes into hand and then my input of how i'm feeling, you know. Since we've already started the reductions. At least i'll be able to still drop down a step on each one of them. I feel like little bit. Like."
214.0,Provider,We don't want to do we don't want to have crash.
10913.0,Patient,yeah yeah I don't need to crash and burn.
214.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's definitely something that's not going to be to your advantage if that happens, you know. No let's. Look at let's take a look at these surveys."
10913.0,Patient,I did not have a chance to do the last. I know.
214.0,Provider,"I know what. What team that's 14 the maritime you calendar, let me put on the unhappy faces."
10913.0,Patient,"I know right yeah How dare I. Oh yeah, but we do have one in here for the 18th of October so right."
214.0,Provider,It says.
10913.0,Patient,"They like one of them says, like every two weeks, but I just have been doing it every week are are they both supposed to be every week."
214.0,Provider,He said the pH humanizing the pressure is supposed to be every week in the BAM and the ace is supposed to be every month.
10913.0,Patient,And a. monthly.
214.0,Provider,When I look at your your submission on October 18 so it's it's pretty recent actually um it says your depression scores of four which is minimum do you think that's a good reflection.
10913.0,Patient,"I think, so I think so. You know."
214.0,Provider,"We think that's a good one, so let's go. here. So here's here's a way to look at this. Okay August 10 which is more than two months away, you were a 10."
10913.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So when. Your depression, has been very. less often and less impactful."
10913.0,Patient,Correct yeah.
214.0,Provider,Okay well that's a that's a good sign.
10913.0,Patient,"It is, it is, and that would show that the rail are seems to be working."
214.0,Provider,So you go.
10913.0,Patient,"You know, so my next strategy would be to get that appointment with chantel and then discuss the further. reductions of how, when to start it, how long to keep it until if another reduction is necessary to keep me from going cold Turkey, you know it does it does kind of depends, you know I like I said I had been on zoloft and seroquel those the original doses. For like 15 years. You know, and that and that's what I when I started this whole program was like when I saw that commercial for a lawyer and it wasn't that I was specifically looking for a lawyer, I was just there's only one or two commercials like it. And there's two different newer meds but watching the you know actually having it on in the background, and I was listening going yeah that's exactly how I feel and then realizing wait a minute. that's without medication and i'm on medication there's something not right here. So."
214.0,Provider,In fairness to you the survey suggest this is improvement.
10913.0,Patient,"And I feel like when like I did the last surveys last week, you know there wasn't as much of a. You know, like a burden or whatnot. And it was more like okay i'm just filling this out just how I feel you know and it depends to you know depends what's going on, you know, like. The week of my husband's accident yeah i'm going to score higher on everything, because of the anxiety, the unknown the worry and the fear. But now that it it's slowly dissipating my reactions are slowly dissipating to to where it comes down to if there ever is really a quote unquote normal level. it's getting down there you know because everybody's different you know. You know, one of the participants in the group. they're low. could be a six. Or could be a two whereas my low would be maybe four or five you know it just depends on the person."
214.0,Provider,"And the circumstance robot. wholesome hmm. That is very true, I think that the idea here, though, is at least we have some tangible tangible documents that we can work with."
10913.0,Patient,To say.
214.0,Provider,"This is an improvement, and yes, I actually agree with you there is an improvement so. it's important. To kind of make sure that the documents. reflect what you feel and then to reflect that the medication, has been working, I think this is a really fabulous time okay."
10913.0,Patient,"yeah yeah you know and it's funny. i've had like the one psychiatrists I had was Dr Gill and I had her for over she's 15 plus years. And I mean she was just the best, but yet I have a friend, whose mom had her and couldn't standard, you know but Dr Gill was always like you seem knowledgeable on this and it's because i've had i've been dying. How do I say this, I wasn't diagnosed these three conditions that I have until I was in my late 20s. But i've had all these symptoms, since I was seven, which was the bipolar the ADHD and the OCD and back then it if they're restrictive on what kind of drugs they give kids nowadays. I was. These weren't even images or thoughts what what's that word what does that mean that didn't happen till you know, a decade or so later. But still was trying to find out information if it didn't say bipolar would say for depression and you know and the ADHD or the OCD I would you know, compared to anxiety, you know."
214.0,Provider,Point good point.
10913.0,Patient,"And it just i've been around the block or actually probably around the universe, a few a few extra times, and so I know. You don't cold Turkey something unless the doctor says, you can, and when you take it, whether you have a good reaction or not so good reaction always check with the doctor. And when you start feeling good don't think Oh well, i'm feeling great I don't need the medicine, because that's showing that the medicines working. Right, you know so yeah it's just. I try to stay up to date. On everything and doing the surveys and the group therapy and the one on ones really helps."
214.0,Provider,"But i'm glad because your your your chart is totally up to date, everything is really, really good i'm going to see something here. know everything. Really really good. Now, so I think what we do is we continue, but you need to know that you don't have an appointment with Sean Tom and I think that's very important, because we need to figure out what we need to take down in all of. Your all we can do yeah I yeah so once I get off with you i'll go back on."
10913.0,Patient,"and make that appointment I I, the only thing I can think of is that there was an appointment and I had it and that wasn't what I thought I had booked you know and it's The one thing is so frustrating with my memory I just. You know I can't even remember what I said two minutes ago."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I know, but I, but I clearly see in your chart there's nothing scheduled for medical follow on."
10913.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm not nothing in there. yeah and and that's Okay, because that disproves that what I thought was wasn't."
214.0,Provider,"But better, we have a communication to realize, you may have thought, a date and going on there and realize, you would actually prolonged because then you have to initiate the phone call we. Have for now. For so actually if there is a benefit so kick the House November 9 at 330 feel."
10913.0,Patient,And that's also a Tuesday. yeah and this time at 330 okay.
214.0,Provider,330 your time.
10913.0,Patient,"And then, what would be the other secondary appointment."
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so let me get this one here. hold on. to you. So the goal here with. No schanberg ninth at 330. I didn't thr. And now, what we will do is. How is the 30th."
10913.0,Patient,"Good okay I got it written down, so I can put it in my phone."
214.0,Provider,"Okay perfect, so let me get that back into your chart real quick. Alright, so 330. On the 30th got this. So all right so just get back on the phone and make them medical follow, because I think that's very important based on what's going on. And then i'll See you in group next week and we'll take it from there."
10913.0,Patient,"Okay, I have a quick question. Sure on group if there happens to be a time or it's not i'm not able to make it, how much time in advance, do you guys need for me to say hey I can't make it."
214.0,Provider,So here's the thing your chart says you're only supposed to go to group once a month.
10913.0,Patient,haha I thought it was once a week.
214.0,Provider,Can you see that now.
10913.0,Patient,You.
214.0,Provider,"won't see right here, it says. weekly. Twice a month individual monthly group."
10913.0,Patient,"Okay, you said week it sounded like he said weekly and then what."
214.0,Provider,or medical follow up.
10913.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Why someone for individual. One time for group, if you look at it's right here."
10913.0,Patient,Oh.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so see the cursor. The curse is saying I want someone so."
10913.0,Patient,I see.
214.0,Provider,"You can come every week that's totally acceptable, but your mandate your minimum requirement is only that you attend."
10913.0,Patient,Possible okay So what does the current medical appointment frequency say weekly I mean what is that indicates i'd have to like log. In.
214.0,Provider,"On something cause, you have to get this medication adjusted and once it's adjusted. Then you're only going to check in with shontelle monthly to the group."
10913.0,Patient,Okay okay well. Then yeah.
214.0,Provider,"yeah between the medication adjustments, we need you to see her weekly."
10913.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah you showing up the group helps exam also could just make an individual medical follow up to see how it's your choice, how you want to do it. Okay yeah it was kind of like yesterday about you know when to take the surveys, you know I forget the gals name but she'd mentioned that she probably heard it earlier on."
214.0,Provider,Social yeah.
10913.0,Patient,"I heard it earlier on, but this brain has no memory of it."
214.0,Provider,"I know I know we were retaining a lot of Informations in. it's so much data that I get it, so I don't have to worry, but it is best if you do those surveys on Sunday."
10913.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely definitely definitely okay. And then now should I.
214.0,Provider,"I think you should make a medical follow up because, to try to do it in groups it's very difficult for shawn tell she has multiple people."
10913.0,Patient,it's better to have some private time with her.
214.0,Provider,"That you can share when you're experiencing she could ask some questions, and you can get better care."
10913.0,Patient,yeah it wasn't a question of seeing her it was a question of doing the BAM and what was that pH Q.
214.0,Provider,"or something sorry well you're going to call up the virtual clinic anywhere right make it. For shontelle. Yes, you can access them walk me through weekly bi weekly and monthly what is confirmed with them as well, since you're. on the phone."
