12768.0,Patient,Hello.
298.0,Provider,hi how are you. what's going on.
12768.0,Patient,"sister was released from jail, a couple days ago, and I have really bad ptsd i've watched her shoot up in her neck before. Having really bad night. Wake up in the morning with really bad anxiety and my dad tells me to put my big girl panties on and get over it, so I don't have any support my mom lives in Florida so she's halfway across the country and she's the only one that really understand."
298.0,Provider,Oh. Where is your sister.
12768.0,Patient,"she's released from jail and she's back doing what she has to do she's on fentanyl so i'm sure she's gonna pass away soon i'm just having really bad anxiety about the whole thing and it's not going away. i've been praying and trying to meditate and I went on a hike yesterday, thinking it would help my mental state but."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, I am so sorry."
12768.0,Patient,The panic attacks are just getting too much i'm vomiting and I can't eat. A lot of pain.
298.0,Provider,I am so sorry. i'm so sorry. What would you like help with medicine Weiss.
12768.0,Patient,"Oh, anything that will call my panic attacks don't shake vigorously shaking and i'm sweating but i'm cold and i'm vomiting it's like my head, I feel really light headed like one, but a faint but i'm not I don't know what's going on."
298.0,Provider,"Well, I have a couple of ideas. One was the first idea is to get rid of the nightmares there's some medicine out there called prison that helps people with ptsd. And sometimes it can take six to eight milligrams to get people to their nightmares to go away so you're not waking up so upset. that's one thought another thought is to get you something to calm your body down for these panic attacks and another thought is to give you, something that would be even stronger for when the panic attacks just there. When the other medication is not working. Then use something like a benzodiazepine when those other things so that it keeps you out of the emergency room."
12768.0,Patient,"It just takes me to such a different state of mind, it just. It really hurts and I don't know what's going on with my body it's like I can't control it at all whatsoever I sat in the shower for an hour this morning. Under cold water trying to calm myself down and then I tried talking to my dad and he told me to put my big girl panties on and get over it so it's like I just have nobody to go to so."
298.0,Provider,I know. It does suck. um. What are your thoughts on.
12768.0,Patient,medications whatever do. This right i'll try anything I just want these feelings to go away so bad.
298.0,Provider,"Okay yeah you're really upset and it's not good for your brain. Every time that you have a meltdown it's hard on the brain because it builds neural pathways to have a meltdown more often and so it's just emotionally it's a really hard on your brain to keep being so upset so let's try our best. So for just regular like four times a day, you can take something called propranolol it's just going to calm your heart rate down and calm your blood pressure down that's and. I don't know what it's going to take so try a half a tablet first and see if it calms your body down if you need a whole tablet take a whole tablet it's not addictive. And it's you know it's the body doesn't become physically dependent on it your brain doesn't become dependent on it so don't worry about that. we're just trying to calm the body down. Having said that, i'm. side effect if you jump up and you feel a little bit lightheaded."
12768.0,Patient,"If I only not filled with like a, let alone, without medications I feel like i'm just so overwhelmed that my heart rate is already beating out of my chest and i'm very dizzy and disoriented. And I haven't really had a panic attack like this in a long time and then. my sister she wrote me a letter like a month ago, saying that she's going to get sober for me like she realizes I need my sister and socially got all this hope distilled in my brain and like. I was very hopeful she was going to come out of jail and come home to family and like get her life straight and now she's back doing the same thing, so I think that's really what's triggering all these like bad memories to pop back up because I haven't had nightmares. of her shooting up in a long time, like over six months so. I think it's very situational but I can't control, my thoughts I can't control my feelings I try I try to do coping mechanisms and it just doesn't work."
298.0,Provider,Okay yeah so i'm giving you some xanax for when it gets too bad okay.
12768.0,Patient,"Like a situation, the sport yeah like that."
298.0,Provider,"Right and so, if you need to i'm giving you point two five milligrams if you need to take two tablets because it's just too much i'm giving you enough to take two tablets, but if it's just really bad just take one tablet and see if you can calm you down okay. and we'll see what your body needs i'll give you 10 tablets to see. You know how much you need now let's talk about presto send for ptsd at that time. The thing about that one is it takes time to figure out what the dosage is for that medicine, so we started the lowest straight. And so you can go. But it just takes a few days a week or so to figure out what it's going to take it's not fast. Trying."
12768.0,Patient,"Almost all the medications I take, for instance, so I get it, or just really. worried."
298.0,Provider,I know. I am so sorry you're going through this I just. I can only imagine having a sister that is so. frustrating.
12768.0,Patient,Like three years older than me and she's my best friend growing up that's why it's also so hard on me rather than my other siblings because they want to close with her as iowa's.
298.0,Provider,"So I want you to only take one capsule at bedtime and see if that works, the next night if it didn't work take two capsules okay. And i'm writing just put take two capsules prn night tears. And we'll see how you do that way, do you have any friends, you know anybody, you can call to just vent on."
12768.0,Patient,"My boyfriend's going to be home and just an hour he went down to the orange county's just a couple days ago into spending time with family, so he hasn't been here. But i've been trying to talk to them on the phone but i'm going to meet up with him soon, so you can actually come for a person."
298.0,Provider,You know what you need the oxytocin good had.
12768.0,Patient,"I do, Miss lunch crushes good for that. comfort me my dad just makes it feel like i'm over exaggerating or i'm taking it."
298.0,Provider,"yeah he dad's just some people it's a generational thing. The other thing you need to do is get it out of your mouth, and you know talk, because if it's running around in your head, it becomes obsessive thoughts and so get it out of your mouth and talk it out."
12768.0,Patient,"yeah I talked with my mom right before it goes. On to this cold, so it kind of helping calm down a little bit i'm not like shaking as bad and feeling nauseous so I mean i've calmed down a little bit, but it's just really hard to get those thoughts out of my head."
298.0,Provider,I now I now.
12768.0,Patient,Just closing my eyes and visualize the whole scene all over again just scares me.
298.0,Provider,and don't hesitate to use box breathing and ice water to calm yourself down to.
12768.0,Patient,"i'm drinking water, I know."
298.0,Provider,"You can take ice and rub it, you know, on your neck to get the brain to calm down it's amazing how that can work."
12768.0,Patient,"All right, shower this morning it didn't seem to work."
298.0,Provider,"But yeah they call it. it's a deep dive reflex. And what happens is. If you think of a diver when he goes down into the water when the water hits his face and the coldness hits his face it lowers his blood pressure and it lowers his heart rate. So when we we try to. redo that you know. In a small sort of way. it's got trick our minds that we need to calm the body down it's a short term thing what works better, is the for for breathing take four seconds to breathe in or the to the counter 1234 and then four seconds to breathe out that tricks the brain to. All right, talk to you later Thank you Emma for seeing."
