726.0,Provider,"Well, tell me a little, a little bit about that. Because I know like you know, the goal is to work towards towards some of the past memories, but i'm. Part of that is also understanding, who you are, as a person, and just kind of what are the things that got led you to this point in your life, where you feel this way so i'm interested in knowing who it is, and you know what are some of those things that are happening."
6026.0,Patient,"Okay, I haven't worked in three years but at my last job. I didn't do the job. I had a arrhythmia with apartment those white and I thought it was caused by my medication, so my medication was changed and It made me very depressed and I didn't realize how depressed I was, I was a little depressed and work was making me very anxious and. Which is doing a horrible job at work, you know for getting a lot of things not helping enough students. Not disciplining the students and I just feel guilty and I just like to do my best with a lot of things and I just feel guilty about how how horrible job I did I saw little embarrass and. Just sometimes I just ruminate about it and some days are better where i'm not thinking about it like that, but then it was better for a while, but now i'm starting to think about it more often."
726.0,Provider,"Something trigger the these feelings of guilt like what what kind of led to you, having a soft about the past."
6026.0,Patient,"i'm just always been there, like. Ever since I stopped working and I had dreams about where i'm not working at a school by have a lot of dreams, where i'm in school. and You know I think it's just anxiety, causing those dreams."
726.0,Provider,"For one year in your dreams when you're in the school, what is your role in the school when you're there."
6026.0,Patient,i'm a student.
726.0,Provider,i'm okay that's interesting that's like a roles reversed.
6026.0,Patient,"Sometimes, is that my high school sometimes is at my elementary school in San Francisco but, even though i'm at my elementary school. i'm not in elementary school I think i'm in high school."
726.0,Provider,Okay. And the things significant happen and because I know you worked at a school right with kids and that was an elementary.
6026.0,Patient,You know my I work with a lot of different age group of my last age group was I was working at a middle school.
726.0,Provider,"OK OK. And so i'm in the dream world the dreams what made you think about them, the work that you were doing with the kids a couple years ago."
6026.0,Patient,"I think, is that, even though i'm not teaching or anything i'm work i'm a student in the school and some of the dreams I can't find my best friend i'm trying to find her at school for lunch and I can't find her."
726.0,Provider,what's your your best friend that in like let's say currently where you're at now are you still friends with that person or is it someone that. You talk to sometimes.
6026.0,Patient,"i'm still friends with her, I don't talk to her as often as I should, and I feel guilty about that and with anxiety about the coven she's become an NGO or phobic so I haven't seen her in a while."
726.0,Provider,isn't it your anxiety or her anxiety in Hong Kong.
6026.0,Patient,"Well, we both had anxiety, but Hers is worse than mine where she doesn't she hardly ever leaves the House."
726.0,Provider,"No, no, there yeah that's far uh huh yeah. So what are the emotions that are coming up for you when you're in the dream."
6026.0,Patient,"i'm panicking I can't find her i'm looking all over for her. yeah I think part was because she has a lot of health problems and for a while her phone wasn't working and now that so she couldn't get my text messages, because I would like try to check on her with text message, just because you know just to keep in contact. But she couldn't get my text messages Oh, she probably got a new phone now she can get my text messages, so I feel better about that."
726.0,Provider,And that's good yeah. It sounds like you both have the anxiety. How long have you known her since high school.
6026.0,Patient,middle school.
726.0,Provider,Oh wow. And was she ever in the teacher role or like a kind of what you were doing.
6026.0,Patient,No she does have a lot of health issues.
726.0,Provider,"See. Well, so i'm interested in um oh hold on i'm sorry. Wait. Sorry, I just had another patient try to come into the call I just thought Center. i'm sorry Aisha. So, so, then this week, have you been having any kind of panic attacks or is it just anxiety in general has increased With these thoughts about. You know about school being about the job."
6026.0,Patient,"um well I usually don't have panic attacks, I think it's more anxiety attacks, but. I haven't been as a just like when we had our first meeting, I was very anxious. And I was anxious about half the day and sometimes when i'm very anxious like people are talking to me, but I can't hear it, so my anxiety has been better it's been you know the usual level which is well the time not too bad."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. And so during the day I you shot, I think I remember you saying that you live with your parents right. Yes, yeah So how are things going to like when you're with them, do you feel like your anxiety i'm. feel stable or do you feel like it increases every once in a while, just because you're living with your family."
6026.0,Patient,"it's my mom like she has anxiety and. Sometimes, she freaks out or sometimes she'll fly off the handle for a little. For little or no reason and that causes anxiety."
726.0,Provider,"So why you should what what are you doing like. Time wise like what does a day look like, for you, if you're home and you're not. Like if you're not working, what do you. occupy your time one."
6026.0,Patient,Sometimes I read Aaron sometimes I do laundry. But Monday through Thursday Monday through Thursday i'm helping my nephew with his homework.
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah you told me about that and does that feel satisfying to you to.
6026.0,Patient,"yeah yeah especially. His grace have improved a lot since last year, so he's on the honorable so that makes me feel good."
726.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I bet you were a big part of that too, because what a blessing to have someone to help you with homework, I was just. yeah yeah."
6026.0,Patient,that's and I helped them with distance learning last year.
726.0,Provider,Have you ever thought. about doing like online Tutoring for kids cuz you could work from home and do that.
6026.0,Patient,"I never thought about it that'd be a good idea, but. let's my anxiety is better because my memory is just so bad."
726.0,Provider,"yeah because I think sometimes like. Like anxiety it's almost Nice, although so it's a double thing right so it's like. When you have anxiety sometimes having a schedule and knowing exactly what you're doing with your time will help decrease anxiety because you know what to expect because anxiety is. The things ideas really like a feeling of like I don't know what's going to happen and it feels really uncomfortable when you're not sure of what's coming or what's going to happen during the day, and so I think like. Like the benefit of a schedule is the fact that you know what to expect and I I guarantee you, you could probably like even do part time as like doing some sort of Tutoring online, because I know some people that do. They teach kids English like but via zoom like with kids in China and things like that. So, like even, I think, and this is just a suggestion i'm not saying you have to do any of this it's just i'm just thinking out loud like ideas it's like. You know, sitting in because you know you can do good work you've worked with your with your nephew and you can see the results of your work."
6026.0,Patient,Right I.
726.0,Provider,"wonder if that might be like a satisfying feeling, to be able to make money and also help a kid out."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, I think that that would be a good ideal. If I do it, maybe next school year once my anxiety is better during the during the pandemic I started grinding my teeth I started. drooling when I sleep I started um I can't drive by the tail At first I could barely drive now I can drive, but now the town."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, I think that you know, through the process with em Dr we can definitely get to that point where we can process like these fears that you have. And I think right now it's just stabilizing the anxiety, so that you're able to manage it and i'm like i'm just thinking of like just a basic level. Like things that that can be done to help improve the anxiety, so that we can get to that point where we could be like. All right, I feel pretty confident that I can you know manage my emotions of our process this this memory um it's like, if you think of think of like math how you get foundational math being six and then you get to geometry and algebra to do the whole. Like a problem so i'm thinking, like the laying the foundational parts for. to stabilize the anxiety and having things that you can do to manage it will help you, because when you start processing right then you're able to be like. Okay, like I recognize this feeling all right, what are what are some of the things that i've already done that have been helpful and so you know, creating. Even if it's even if it's one thing I show that you do in the morning, or one thing at night that is kind of like a self care thing or just help you contain the day instead of feeling like it's all over the place, and because your whole men and that's the space that you're in yeah."
6026.0,Patient,"So one I usually do is. stretch in the morning and stretch at night, because I have back and neck pain from a car accident, I had a few years ago, so my chiropractor showed me. Some stretches so I usually try to do that in the morning and at night."
726.0,Provider,"guys awesome that's really good and um do you notice a difference on days like me don't stretch how your body feels. Yes, oh right."
6026.0,Patient,"So I usually in during the day I usually try to. just touch my toes to help stretch out my back. So I do, that a few times and then i'll open my arm. My arm. Yes. And I do that just during the day."
726.0,Provider,"I need to I was wondering, you know how you were talking about that dream will during the dream, where you have a arm anxiety. Yes, would, would you be willing to do so it's within the emt er but it's called he emt it's. I movement desensitization but without the processing so classically traditionally with em Dr. The RS for reprocessing a memory, but you can process a physical sensation in your body like a feeling, so we could target your for like today, we can target this dream, you had because it's also causing you to ruminate about work from three years ago. So I wonder if we if we try it. let's see how your body feels after after doing a little bit of that of processing through our body would that sound okay to you."
6026.0,Patient,That sounds good.
726.0,Provider,"yeah all right, let me give me a second, I have to close my window because it's getting pulled in here just give me one second i'll be right with you. Alright, so Aisha so what i'm going to ask you to do so this is like a nice starter to how em Dr works. Like I said we're not going to process a specific memory, I just want you to focus on body sensations okay so so let's let's say that your industry again or you're feeling these. you're starting to feel the anxiety of either be in your dream of being in the school and feeling panicky because you can't find your friend. Where do you feel if you were to scan your body from the top of your head to your toes Where would you feel the anxiety in your body."
6026.0,Patient,My test.
726.0,Provider,"Okay okay. And yep and just if you're comfortable, you can close your eyes Now I want you to if you're comfortable doing this, you can put one hand on your heart and just try to make contact with what's showing up for you, with the anxiety is there a color a smell a texture to this anxiety. Does it feel heavy or light. Heavy heavy okay."
6026.0,Patient,I must make my muscles tighter okay.
726.0,Provider,When you say your muscles. feel tighter which muscles. Can you identify that are starting to feel tighter.
6026.0,Patient,My felder okay.
726.0,Provider,"you're doing a beautiful job alright, so this is mobile do so just come back in the room. Okay, and so i'm going to show you um there are four different ways that I can do the I movements and you tell me which one you're comfortable with Okay, so the first one is following my fingers just with your eyes, not with your head just advise. This. The other two are like this. like that. Or the last one, which is up and down like that. Which one, would you be comfortable doing the I movements were."
6026.0,Patient,up and down.
726.0,Provider,"like that. yeah okay perfect so Aisha I always tell everybody on we start the process if i'm going too fast or too slow, just let me know because I want. You to feel comfortable at this okay and i'll preface this by saying, let your mind go where wants to you don't just become aware of the body sensations if it's moving if it seems still. Any thoughts any anything that's coming up in your mind just become aware of it, and just let your mind process what it what's happening in your body Okay, and trust your body, because it really knows what it's doing when you do this okay. Alright, so we'll start so just go into that feeling of. The feeling that you're having in your body you feel it in your chest, and then you feel your muscles feeling tighter on your shoulders imagine that this is happening and you're you know you're you're in that school okay. meeting you."
6026.0,Patient,i'm. Just my branding became a little more restricted. My shoulders kind of shook a little bit just a little bit of panic.
726.0,Provider,"You want to continue. Yes, okay so let's just see what happens okay if it becomes too overwhelming Aisha any point, you can tell me like you can signal me and i'll stop doing the I movement so okay. Alright, so just go back to that last feeling that you had in your body okay just focus on that. Now."
6026.0,Patient,i'm feeling a little shaky a little misty.
726.0,Provider,You if you feel like emotions like wanting to cry or just feeling overwhelmed it's completely normal okay so just so you know it's not strange at all it's completely normal ah alright so let's keep going with it all right.
6026.0,Patient,"Okay now breathe a little faster a little harder. Now i'm just thinking I where is my friend, but I know I can find her just feeling worried."
726.0,Provider,"intensity of the anxiety has a increase stay the same, or has decreased."
6026.0,Patient,um i'll say decrease because starting to feel like you know I know I can find her and i'm not breathing as hard and as fast.
726.0,Provider,For lucky boone with it okay.
6026.0,Patient,Now I feel like I know I can do this and i'm not as shaky or freedom as hard i'm feeling a little bit more. Confident.
726.0,Provider,That feeling okay.
6026.0,Patient,i'm feeling like I can do this. Now i'm feeling like. Things aren't that bad I can do this.
726.0,Provider,And how does your body feel now.
6026.0,Patient,More relax.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
6026.0,Patient,"I still have some tightness in my shoulders, but it's not as bad."
726.0,Provider,"All right, let's focus that on the shoulder okay just focusing on that sensation so when you follow my i'm just to be aware of what's happening here in your shoulders okay."
6026.0,Patient,"My shoulders feel a little better, but now i'm starting to feel it on the left side of my neck."
726.0,Provider,So keep going with it all right. focus on that.
6026.0,Patient,"Mine next a little better by a pint the pain kind of moved up a little bit this feeling better, but the pain moved up."
726.0,Provider,Inside your left shoulder.
6026.0,Patient,And the left side of my neck right here.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so just take notice of that um and actually while I when I do this, you can put one hand let's say on your shoulder where you're feeling it just to make contact with it. and Just really connect with it and then let's see what happens as you do that, and you follow my movements okay. Okay, you just follow me yep."
6026.0,Patient,neck it's been a little better when i'm feeling a little tension in my arm. intention of my arm.
726.0,Provider,"So. So, and this this arm, I want you to just if you're comfortable, you can close your eyes, you can like lightly gaze up the floor right just ask your body, ask that kind of your body would if it's trying to tell you something. And just let let your mind, you know how you whatever shows up."
6026.0,Patient,My mom telling me just telling me this is hard.
726.0,Provider,"Okay. So let's. step back and let's talk about um let's talk about what showed up for you, so this is hard So what do you think. If your body is telling like saying that to you, what do you think that means."
6026.0,Patient,i'm just lately i've been thinking life is just hard but it's hard for everybody.
726.0,Provider,"So your body is telling you it's hard yes. Have you ever done any anything like this before. I can Okay, so I know it looks really strange right, so what you were doing is your body was processing the physical sensations that were happening in your body with anxiety and so. So emotions will exacerbate any body pain, so if you're in any kind of physical pain any kind of emotions will feed that. And so the intensity of the tightness the feeling that you get in your neck, and your body, it intensifies it, even though we know right that it was because of a car accident. But the emotions will also feed into that and so what we what you were able to do is you were able to identify a belief that you have that's kind of. affecting you in a physical way or it's feeding into that that physical pain that you already have and so some of the stuff like when I when I asked you to do this right that's the call it. So we're eight. there's no specific word for for what I was doing it i'm sorry I can't like I don't know why my mind is blinking on it, but it's oh it's somatic. somatic means the body, and so what we're doing is we're trying to incorporate because you do have pain. How that connects with the anxiety as well, or the depression so you're really making contact with that pain and instead of pushing it off you're trying to figure out what it's trying to tell you, by doing that. What we what were your thoughts on that because I know it's a feel strange, the first time you do it if you've never done it so i'm curious to see what you were thinking about that process."
6026.0,Patient,um it feels worse than beginning to the starts to feel better.
726.0,Provider,"you'll start to see to that when you start processing memories, it feels it feels intense and it feels really uncomfortable. But the goal is that by the end of that processing of that thought or that memory that year they focus on for that session is that it'll start to feel better. So, especially with trauma, if you think of traumas like a seed and out of that seed grow pros are all these routes that come out of it, those are the. Those are the behaviors or the symptoms that you don't want to live with like oh I compulsively eat or. I can't help it I just keep doing the same thing over and over again, and I don't know why so when we target your like these specific memories, for example, today we just did today we just did like an anxiety of a dream that you had, but when you start processing like. A specific memory, like a car accident or the other one that you told me about where it was at night. The it's not going to feel good in the middle, in the midst of it you're not going to feel great. But what it'll do is throughout time you'll start reducing the anxiety, the depression that usually starts to start going down because your body's processing. From the to the root of what caused it in the first place so there's there's like a normal. Quote unquote there's a normal level of anxiety which is I gotta get to work, I gotta get up I gotta get ready right. Your level that you're talking to me about anxiety is is out of the normal like healthy anxiety, so this is just a byproduct of of something that happened in the past that is now showing up in this way anxiety does that make sense to you. Yes, yeah. So I i'm. i'm thinking for for our next session would you like to process, maybe something that's that's an old memory, but it's not completely. triggering for you like, if you can. So I have a quote so so on a scale of one to 1010 being a can't I cannot handle this at all I can do this and 12021 being completely fine you feel nothing at all it's like you're good. If you can pick a memory that maybe it's out of maybe at a six or a seven is there anything that you can think of that maybe would be helpful for you to process. And even if you don't think about it today, maybe by our next session, if you have something in mind, we can we can do a process in session on that."
6026.0,Patient,"Okay, well, let me think i'm. Trying to think of something out of six. I would say the car accident, I had a few years ago, because it doesn't feel as bad anymore. So maybe that's the same."
726.0,Provider,For okay. Okay. So why don't we target that in our next session does that sound like a good idea for you.
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
726.0,Provider,"Because I think this session was just like a preview of what it would be like to process um you know, a memory specific memory. Okay. So I shall i'm gonna because of the holiday, I am taking some time off so i'm going to look at on my calendar for the next, let me see where you stand up two weeks. I have, on the first week of January. and Would you like to do a similar time similar day. Yes, okay so today's Tuesday. Or are you an early bird by any chance, like are you offering morning. Yes, you are okay. I have here. An ATM. or 9am."
6026.0,Patient,Is that is.
726.0,Provider,"Nine that is January SIS would that work for you. I have you for January 5 at nine. So Asia, I will see you then on that date. And, and we will work on this this memory, with the car. Okay."
6026.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
726.0,Provider,"you're very welcome, I hope you have a good rest of the day."
6026.0,Patient,It so have a nice holiday Have a nice nice Merry Christmas.
726.0,Provider,"Oh, you too, thank you. bye bye."
