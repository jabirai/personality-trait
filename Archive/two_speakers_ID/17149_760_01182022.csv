17149.0,Patient,doing tonight.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. So how have you been with. The things you've been working on. As your depression and your alcohol use, then the last."
17149.0,Patient,"it's a waste, I think. yeah i'm. Just today I woke up and walk he said something the beginning of the year, I felt like I was walking back and track, you know I go along the more consistently to the gym and everything. But today I just woke up like me, like me, I really want to feel to energize do nothing but nothing too much today. You know, like I wash my car which is like one thing I usually like doing all the time it was just like I feel like it was more of a drag then like Oh, you know I enjoy to wash my car, so I just feel like I said the mood today i'm in i'm when it comes to alcoholism. I honestly don't think nothing's changed i'm still not like hasn't gotten higher or lower is."
760.0,Provider,it's about about the same.
17149.0,Patient,he's just about to say.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay so so what the purpose of this session Carlos. is to kind of. Create like a what i'll call a treatment plan which. Is a kind of a collaborative process of planning how are we going to use these sessions, how are we going to focus these sessions. And you know, at the end of the day, Carlos the treatment plan is your plan it's not my plan, but I am here to support you in pinpointing your goals both long term goals. journey on goals. And then, identifying some concrete steps. You have to take they don't have to be great big steps, but they can you know just small at least small small, medium or large steps okay to to work towards those goals. Does that make sense to you."
17149.0,Patient,"Yes, that's actually perfect because, like it's like okay like I love talking to you like oh what's funny, though."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so let's let's talk about long term goals. What are your long term goals. motivation aside."
17149.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, are you want a house. And a car real."
760.0,Provider,Financial financial financial security or.
17149.0,Patient,Stability yes.
760.0,Provider,to afford those things.
17149.0,Patient,"Okay, and I feel like that's very possible within the field that i'm going for school so."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17149.0,Patient,How would you like our school going. it's going good I like I said I do still need this last semester i'm so picking out like I need to pick out like order summer classes right now. Customer starts next week so i'll probably get it done with him tomorrow um but yeah other than that i'm not i'm not as excited as I thought it was gonna be but.
760.0,Provider,i'm not.
17149.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not, I have no idea why i'm not just like Am I am not scared i'm not worried i'm just not excited."
760.0,Provider,"Well, because we sometimes it when things are mundane they can be exciting to start a new project or new you know educational program But then when we can do the work part of it and it's it's it's been in my life now for a period of time, you know, there is, it can feel less exciting."
17149.0,Patient,yeah and I think.
760.0,Provider,"But as you get as you start working towards meeting those goals and you start pushing through that work that you're required to do to make that happen and will come back as you're completing and then as you're you know starting the process of seeking employment in that field. Yes, so kind of you know that's just part of it. easy and we're going to wake up some days we're going to be really motivated and then some days we're going to feel like you said yeah. You know. yeah so. You know so that's part of it, you just kind of reminding yourself, you know that you know that's why it's kind of important to identify your financial goals, because without doing that work you don't get the completion of that education to get you the financial stability. That you."
17149.0,Patient,prefer right.
760.0,Provider,"You don't have to like to go to school, every day, because you know it does become mundane and there's nothing wrong with that. As long as you do it and put in your effort."
17149.0,Patient,"Yes, correct."
760.0,Provider,"And so, are you are you struggling with that in any way or you're still able to do that."
17149.0,Patient,"i'm able to like put an effort, I wasn't surprised when I like i'm sorry to get the materials and everything I worked, I would like to think that I weren't good under stress, you know, like. I don't really panic or you know collapses and myself, for the most part, but then like I said, sometimes like mice me in the butt because, like sometimes where I should be really stressed about something I like I you know it's like very doable like oh I busted out. But. anyway."
760.0,Provider,That causes that affects our mental health. yeah and we get overly stressed. Maybe then I have to cram because so now I can't sleep tonight.
17149.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know, when you start to neglect yourself in other ways yeah so."
17149.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,I feel like getting the work done.
17149.0,Patient,"Yes, and I think that's one of the main goals, I do want to really focus on this semester, just to like. stick to my promises and when I say this day I was going to study, am I gonna really go social media. My phone i'm just gonna just study and cram as much information as I can about my materials, I need to learn about yeah um yeah and then, just like really dedicating study time and really maximizing study time. I feel like those would be the best I think one of the things I want to really put as my goal um Another thing I do want to present because, like I need to get an internship before actually graduate because I had never gone at all, so I."
760.0,Provider,failed again Carl.
17149.0,Patient,"Construction engineering. Technology yeah so my main goal, I want to become a field engineer, so that we're not so much the office, I really like being outdoors you know. So that's typically what i'm going to be looking out for I feel like it's very doable i'm not to stress, even if I don't get a job right out. By the same time I am why you know i'm i'm pushing myself word for it it's just that i'm always in the back of my head it's like I know if I don't get a job right away i'm just gonna keep into me until I do yeah."
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay. Okay, so all right um so you want to focus on your school. You want to build your motivation and let me ask you a little bit about your time on your cell phone and social media."
17149.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,"How much time, do you think you're spending on that."
17149.0,Patient,"Day, probably closer to. Like three to four hours, possibly yeah."
760.0,Provider,"at different dates different times during the day, not all at once."
17149.0,Patient,Oh yeah no I saw like a total just talking about like a day.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, good. Okay um do you think that sometimes you procrastinate with. Either homework or other things that are important to you like going to the gym and things like that, because you're spending time on social media or do you think that that's a problem for you in any kind of way."
17149.0,Patient,"Honestly, I think it is. Good to start distracted very easily. yeah so I feel like like i'm when i'm on social media and. If no one really tells me anything. An hour about right. Does that quick and i'm like oh like what will happen, you know the time."
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay well, one thing that I could suggest. Carlos is to there's there's applications that you can download to your phone. will keep track of the amount of time you spend on it. And it might be good for you, because just to have that information, how many hours, did I spend today or yesterday. To kind of examine that. Because what happens with us when we're on our phones when we're. You know we're sending those messages back. it's kind of it's easy for us to get lost in that. We kind of get. And I think it's. You know, I was born in a generation that we didn't have those things, thankfully, I would not have wanted to be young. do that because I watch you guys, you know, I have a son, too, but I watch you guys, you know struggle with that and I see how time kind of gets eaten up and you're not even aware of what's happening and you're not choosing to do other things that might be more helpful to you in your life. You know. I don't know if that sounds like something you might want to do to kind of like look at that to help you kind of assess your own level of motivation that perhaps time on the phone might be. Robbing you some of. Some of their motivation, although it is normal to we do, we do have days that we feel motivated and we'd be updates we don't feel motivated."
17149.0,Patient,"You know. that's actually pretty funny cuz I never really thought about how much time you put on the phone i'm just always on it, but I just don't really like. On. Because even like today, when I was watching my car the middle Washington I watched like. 230 minute videos on YouTube bye."
760.0,Provider,washing washing. Did you go. Did you go to one of those self wash places or did you go to one of those places where I wash for you.
17149.0,Patient,"So what am I currently am my parents house or not, because today is my mom's birthday. yeah and I know I have i've stuff here and stuffing my last. And I pomona I watched it there, and then I got some stuff going on here."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so when you're taking time to watch the videos online nobody's watching your car."
17149.0,Patient,yeah anyways yeah. And like I just listened to the audio while I do it's a time so it's. Okay.
760.0,Provider,"But it does put your attention. I think that would be something to look at just because you know. I know how that that's affecting us. In it, so and I know you're a young guy Carlos so i'm just kind of suggesting that to you. To kind of look at that to help you, with your motivation okay so so you want to work on your motivation, you want to work on your education and your financial stability is there anything else. We talked last time about relationship issues and. How was your depression. Are you feeling depressed."
17149.0,Patient,"um I don't know I don't think I have recently. just said i'm just like. sort of in a haze or just. I don't know like yeah last time I saw my family's happy this morning, when I woke up or just like. i'm just really not mellow but i'm just like pretty. New today because i'm not really that talkative as much surprisingly. or no. Because our snapchat they have this feature where like every single video same day when years go along by ABC like a little bit of like what like what are you doing that same that day. Like four or five years ago. And like I just said, I just I don't know like I know changing because I could see differently, like me, myself right now versus like five years ago, what it was like my mom's birthday and like what I was doing, then I was like oh wow yeah so I feel like i'm."
760.0,Provider,"Is that is that you, you think the times were better. Back then, five years ago, or do you think but times are better now."
17149.0,Patient,"Oh, I think, honestly, so right now I just feel at the time, I felt like the time was. it's better right now for five years ago, like five years ago, when looking back on it, I. I think I was just more happier, then you know but, like me, being able to like actually branch out to sort of like experience the world, I saw. Growing by doing this myself about myself, but you know, like just being out here, away from my family I do feel like it is a better position, where I was that not so i'm really fully able to explore things that I really want to do. But."
760.0,Provider,"stage in life when you're kind of as a young person. You know and it's still pretty new. You know this whole world of. You know, doing adult things you know. Getting education getting employment being having my own place my own home. kind of thing, so it can be it's very different than you know teenage years because you, you know as long as your parents are supporting you you usually. it's easier with that, and you can just focus on your social life in your school and that's that. right here now it's like you have all these other things, so it might feel maybe a little bit strange, maybe, sometimes I think it's normal to feel a little overwhelmed. With with those changes. And just kind of know that that you you'll you'll get through it, you know it's. Just a normal part of development and all of. us. We we all live through it. So. Does that does that sound like that makes some kind of sense."
17149.0,Patient,"That makes perfect sense, you know um. I remember again so there's one time I got really overwhelmed like of November. November of last year. There was so I started, I was investing into cryptocurrency and i'm i'm on investments, like I know some with what I invest stuff it's like. The stock market X y&z I know that I put money in that I know at the end of the day I don't care if I lose it all. So it's not like i'm gambling much i'm not you know I mean it's gambling, but like this is money and i'm not afraid to lose you know this is sort of like i'm. not really not really in a sense of my savings, but the way of how much money, I was getting it almost like I did when I say me Oh, but there was an action where I got my account got hacked and then they stole around like $50,000 that I saved up in there."
760.0,Provider,yeah that money in there or is that money that the market kind of earned you.
17149.0,Patient,"Well, I wasn't much more than I think in total, how much I pulled in was like a total around like $15,000 so that was like every other picture i'll put $20 $20 $20 so it wasn't looking like. That drastically yeah oh."
760.0,Provider,So that if you think about losing that money. As we were just talking about financial stability. yeah yeah.
17149.0,Patient,"and actually during like the whole time period I do remember having like another system motivation, so to speak, you know because I like I was able to physically see like you know financially like I was at a better place than it was originally and um yeah I just felt like. It I was just really motivated and stuff like that, but after that happened is just yeah I just sort of like plateaued and yeah like I still look at the market in everything but it's like. I don't have that flexibility more, because this is like, before I even moved in supermoto moved into the other house it. was so like I don't have that financial stability to actually go back in and like."
760.0,Provider,Again it's pretty much yeah.
17149.0,Patient,"yeah exactly so that's one thing I know for sure, like once I. start my career and everything like I know i'm gonna definitely start there and I know for sure, like you know help me sort of like get back on top of things a little more, because I feel like the market helped me. become more intuitive to everything else because of it, just like social media and everything you know I just felt like I was really more aware back. And, just like motivated more to like get up and going cuz yeah yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes I think when we when we. Experience for the first time, you know higher education, higher than high school. Are you know living on our own in our own place sometimes there can be like. Uncertainty maybe even. Fear how am I going to make this work, I think I think it's common for. People to to feel that way, do you think that sometimes you feel a little over or maybe even it's just not fear, maybe it's just overwhelmed. here's too strong, of a word okay. So sometimes. When we feel that way it can affect our motivation."
17149.0,Patient,"they're wrong yeah cuz I mean even. Ever since high school and somebody dad oh yeah you don't want because there's really no but not. Like i'm a good people person, but i'm not like customer services and my first thing to do, I could do it with some charity. And, just like ever since then, since, and I was in high school, I always says everyone that i'm an engineer X y&z they do the family and don't get me wrong like. i'm totally fine with that it's just you know it just in the back end by command and I gotta do I gotta I gotta prove to myself and my parents, you know that could do this and stuff like that yeah. hello, I don't even taking a second longer than I thought. But I mean everything happens for a reason, and I repeat myself over too much um I was about to get into an argument with my. Because i'm this Christmas they actually came over surprisingly, and my parents have like a different what I have like a whole different light that's a whole nother thing I didn't see the records, but. lottery sure my aunt and uncle are really too buddy buddy with my dad at the moment. that's your your dad sister. though my mom's sister. And she she basically told her well yeah i'm graduating this spring like are you i'm happy, you know, like oh sorry oh yeah i'm graduating spring and then she came over here on the side conference. She was like Oh, are you sure you keep saying that X y&z and I was like yeah sure, because I don't see any of your kids me engineers, like, I wanted to tell that by doing I was like yeah. it's like Oh, it just got me so upset I mean she was wrong, but the same time, like, I was upset she said, like that, like like."
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes it's good not to share that kind of information with people that might say things that are a little bit hurtful and we can we can kind of set up some boundaries by just. watching what we say, maybe, maybe, she would be the person you'll to the hotel after you have the diploma on your wall. yeah and the thing. Is that make sense. kind of avoid that because it doesn't sound like you have you or your family have a close relationship with her."
17149.0,Patient,"So you. know that my my mom's really close with them. they're only cousins in the US, we have we have another cousin to but um yeah there's there's only two classes, that we have here in the US for a month and in San Diego and other ones like around the. Around brand area I believe so i'll give or take. By all the rest of my family members are in Mexico or, if not there."
760.0,Provider,"So you want to be close to her, maybe."
17149.0,Patient,"I could get closer for kids you know my cousins are cool. You know. You know. I wouldn't want to hang out with the 24 seven, but I could spend like a day with them."
760.0,Provider,Here and. yeah.
17149.0,Patient,"But. I feel like. I don't know I don't know I already talked to him was like I really don't like you just because she always puts things in my mom's ahead had about like how. How we think that we might do or X, Y Z or I kind of ignored my act or how will be so rebellious ideas tissue lets us do this when my because she controls, like my cousins and my uncle like so much and it's like. God so just I would hate going up like that. yeah that's. that's a whole nother story. Too off topic."
760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah let's let's get back to your goal, so we, we have the long term goal of completing your school. And I mean financially stable, so that you can have your home. What about some short term things. So, you mentioned the gym."
17149.0,Patient,The organization definitely I want to be more organized and my time management.
760.0,Provider,What are some concrete steps that. You can take to be more organized.
17149.0,Patient,"Honestly, I feel like one one option for me to be more organized I really, really, really need to start making reminders on my calendar and actually looking at them because i'm like um I i've done I. can't see or occasion I can't so um. This past couple months i've been noticing exactly when I worked at what times at work, and you know it's really be helped me a lot when it looks like so organizing my day. But. I feel like I just stopped doing that the beginning of this year, which is a little funny because you know that's. Why. i'm breaking everything and I just like you know. But what else. I. One thing I actually really want to do this for total I really just want to get up early morning and like just. By like lot of time together pockets, or something or like nine the waiters already have like you to go to the gym or made breakfast you know, like i've already like have done something even if it's a great to get out, but I do but. yeah."
760.0,Provider,Are you getting to bed on time to make that happen.
17149.0,Patient,"Are you staying up late. i'm actually getting more sleep here well and i'm listening to my body to go to sleep earlier so like how the latest i've gone to sleep this. past month was far too. huh that's a latest but I will happen once like and I was just because I got actually happen today. and asked blue chance to like finish the game before school started. and, hopefully, you could finish it by Thursday, but I got really far like I progressed a lot in there yeah I just another jungle I have before school starts. yeah definitely like go back and schedule, have a rhythm."
760.0,Provider,"About a bed what time, maybe."
17149.0,Patient,"I want to say, like 11 is OK, for me, I will. be perfect."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, that that helps. And that that kind of adds up with the telephone and social media time, though, that the video in time, to which the phone i'm going to track that part because kind of separate. yeah. But but you're you're helping you don't have a problem, putting that down when it's time to go to work or."
17149.0,Patient,"Okay, good. yeah not at all when I do homework actually listen to music a lot, so it helps me for some people really doesn't but, for me, I think it yourself yeah okay."
760.0,Provider,How about how's your relationship we talked about that quite a bit last time.
17149.0,Patient,"how's that yeah. Actually, we have a really silly recent look like, so instead of getting gifts and everything we went to San Diego. So we go in so with some points that I got from using are using my credit card I got enough points to go to otter free services. two nights ago so and yeah those are the goodness great and fun, we want to see shifted the so that's in the port I forgot what the middleweight you are you the USA."
760.0,Provider,"Oh yes, yes, yes i'm. in San Diego into that area, they have all those ships."
17149.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,yeah they have the midway and then further down. They have all those yeah. i've been to that too yeah.
17149.0,Patient,"So that's where he wants to. We actually we are hotel wasn't like downtown San Diego so right in the hundred centers around. And then, what else did we go Missouri botanical garden, they were to the. Was it. i'm good so it's like the national. Then, like the Museum of natural history something like that. in San Diego as well, what else did he do he just went out to eat really just enjoyed ourselves. yeah it was really good for like a really good to us, I also. I also bought like a little game, a couple of game where it was like could put your cards and all it was it was just questions that we asked one another and added a level of intimacy of like 123 and yeah we just did the bedroom. hotel room our downtime so we took a lot of pictures. I feel like yeah I thought that was like my first part, just going around just being with them and yeah that's pretty much it."
760.0,Provider,You feel like are your relationship is improved since the last time we spoke.
17149.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah I feel like it is, and I think it's always going to be proven don't get me wrong. There are days that. Nowadays, there are like citizens have just grabbed the wrong, so they really like and I were talking or sending messages back and forth and stuff like that, like sometimes she sends. me something regarding towards of like. The cheating incident and everything and she does it mean in a way, like, I know what she's doing it on purpose and we can feel guilty everything I just thought I know and like I know it's gonna be one way harder for her to like processor sort of like. not deal with it, but like also to sort of."
760.0,Provider,let it go. yeah let it go. Or maybe I forgiven and maybe it's just the part of not thinking about it so much.
17149.0,Patient,"Yes, like that part itself, you know um and I don't really I want the optimism me. hopes are like feels like she will forgive me, one day, but realistically like if I was filling in her shoes I don't know how long does it take before yeah it's actually free for your partner, you know. um, but that is the answer to that she does I haven't really talked to her about it, yet, because I know where it's from. But yeah i've actually further probably next couple months. Just I was just thinking Okay, you know, like how you doing you know, I wonder, like to sort of talk about it, and everything and yeah for the most part, whenever we talk and it's pretty we don't really raised voice raise our voices with each other. We always try to hit the we also like here brother personnel winner, if ever like it's rub each other, will say like oh i'm sorry, can I can I say something you know it's pretty like. pretty good I can really key that time, one thing that we both noticed that we know where we can make an improvement, our work and our relationship is always stop, always assuming. That. We know what a person wants, you know. There are times, where like we're doing something like you can read them rate times the. Green person, and you know we just make assumptions that all they probably meant this or. They probably want to do that when in reality it's like we should just ask them and just to double check with them because yeah like that's where we get a lot of miscommunication a little alone, a lot of like well like, why did you do that, you know and. So I thought you meant this are not used to this like oh no like he's asked me but that's something that we both do."
760.0,Provider,"that's your. that's your working on it, it seems like."
17149.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. No, no problem just one of the things is realizing it. Oh, we do make a lot of just. So that. We are working on. Nothing is trust. For sure I have all the trust in her. mm hmm but obviously i'm not the one right. Now. Just do a lot more last time we were to go get books, because we went on a little Barnes and noble date. So the books. And the books that. pretty sure took a picture of it. Okay okay so. So the books something. That was like. early December. When we got the button everything I asked her like oh like where are we at right now, from a present from Joseph where are we at and she said at so."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17149.0,Patient,"So, like I said, like I said we're progressing and move forward and everything, but I just know that we're not 100 so I just want to like. Just ask, in a way, where. i'm not trying to like sort of just like really expressed that like i'm not trying to convince you to be just like for like to know, because I really don't know. Where you like. Where you're at with this mentally in anything I know you know he appreciates our work and everything, so I don't want to like I don't feel like it's appropriate to like talk about it whenever you're like so low stress and everything so yeah."
760.0,Provider,"OK OK so you're making good progress with that, but what are some of the other things that you're wanting to work on, is there anything else that we haven't already talked about. You said you want to go to the gym. yeah like that. Number times a week or is that not something you really want to."
17149.0,Patient,"Oh yeah no minimum four five times a week is like typically the mondo is doing, of the past."
760.0,Provider,But for.
17149.0,Patient,"It oh yeah I go for about like an hour an hour half at a time. goes actually is like another goal our to do, I just want to spend with my family and not get annoyed of them, you know. My parents like I just like. I really could see the conversations that says, I just started like merging I give them whatever oh yeah excellent being like oh that's it, you know no hate on like I love my parents, you know I know they're not perfect and obviously i'm not perfect. But it just like I don't know. Just yeah I was. Like I know they love me and really proud of me, but this is."
760.0,Provider,What is. hesitation that makes you say that. What is that.
17149.0,Patient,"it's just because, like, I even saw i've tried to talk to them about like certain things and everything but they really sensitive when it comes to religion and stuff. So, by the time I. saying anything bad about that or anything at all, or when I tried to have a holding on conversation with them there's just religion always get some how. It give me about something very basic agree like oh my God like really like having this exams and stressed about and I just i'm just wanting to like that's about it yeah what he was just pretty God, and you know. And it's a cool Thank you like, I would like that'd be totally fine if you didn't tell me that, like every. organization and."
760.0,Provider,it's not something it's not a belief that you share at least to that degree. With that.
17149.0,Patient,"Exact wrong like. When I entered meditation I always have like God. always in the back of my head, but it's like it's not something I really truly take the heart, so to speak, Okay, I believe in God. Because I feel like at the other day, you always see something to like believe, for me, I know there's a higher power out there. So what's it like you know I don't know I feel like there's a higher power."
760.0,Provider,Maybe maybe that's an area you haven't quite. explored yet.
17149.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't really quite honestly, just because, like, I was forced to go to church all the time I was never really. Asked Oh, would you like to go hero was the movie about it, I was really. Like forced to like go with her. So I feel like this is that everybody had just had like you. Know like a not a negative effect which is like over the years, like what I got older, I became more rebellious going because you know, like, I rather go like whole terms, then having told to go. Okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right, well it's not something so you want to hear a different kind of interaction with your parents."
17149.0,Patient,"yeah and. In all honesty, i've seen this happen because, like the other. two semesters ago I felt a class I needed to like continue on with my degree and what a class a prerequisite class and I saw my data like how like do like it's hard like i'm so like you guys are stressing me out a lie, you know, and I can't talk to you guys about it because. Why. The then because, like you, don't listen you guys are ignorant like you know, like if I tell you something like okay like he goes out those. Listening you know, and I was like. He was saying, like X y&z and he said. So sounds. Like my hours. Calm down. keep doing that happens, know that the fire was just like a normal conversation like for you to see you like my point."
760.0,Provider,"Well it's good it's good to express that before you get to your you know, to have that emotional response. You know. So i'm glad i'm sorry your audio is a little bit like. sounded like it was in a tin can I was kind of struggling to hear you a little bit. I still still kind of. it's still kind of weird can you hear me OK."
17149.0,Patient,"OK, we do something."
760.0,Provider,"Okay that's better. I just heard you say the kind of snaps that you are feeling overwhelmed that you felt class. yeah, what are the different kinds of support from dad. Can. kind of say."
17149.0,Patient,"Exactly, not the same, not the same thing."
760.0,Provider,Before you really upset like when the annoyance is building. I live it's like so severe. yeah easier to catch that.
17149.0,Patient,Just.
760.0,Provider,"don't know, sometimes I just want to hear like a different kind of support from. yeah i'll let them know. So. Go ahead go ahead."
17149.0,Patient,"No, no i'm not."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, but I just wanted to is there anything else that you're wanting to work on, or is there anything else."
17149.0,Patient,"That you need to discuss. For the most part, I don't think so, I feel like I really gave you like a brief like snapshot of like every dollar that really wasn't I happened, I was born in this past couple. Years or something I mean other than the fact that i'm. Oh yeah so I actually learned know you're running you know just kidding I was, I was lying i'm there so during the night that happened, where she went through Jesus all like everything was talking to my girlfriend called my girlfriend my girlfriend called her mom told her about it and. um yeah so I feel like that's right there was a it's like a touchy subject um but so like when the holidays came around and you just came around you know. We both didn't really go over each others house houses and everything. My girlfriend said, well, I just don't feel comfortable thinking you know I don't want to put this image in my family's head where like I think that we're 100% where we're not and I was like you know totally fine like I understand i'm not. I do wrong like i'm a little sad but i'm not upset I, how can I be upset about realistically, you know um and. recently. Her mom told her that she said that I could come over if I wanted to, and everything so. she's definitely very supportive of. The decision that her daughter's making everything but I don't feel comfortable coming over and it's like i've talked to her, you know."
760.0,Provider,Unless you talk to her mother.
17149.0,Patient,"yeah first, before I go over her house yeah."
760.0,Provider,We. can sell the telephone or how you gonna do it no. don't do that as you're coming over to her house and you can lay the foundation that we're going to talk.
17149.0,Patient,"Welcome to say. Something. along the lines of like. This is like a mistake that I made. For myself. i'm sorry. I just know I just saw one day, you will see. never, never back, even though I. really do. Not already doing."
760.0,Provider,"Well, and you're trying to make amends, not only to your girlfriend but also to her family, which is good. So that sounds like a good thing you're going to do so, I guess do it when you're ready. This kind of takes a lot of bravery to do that kind of thing. yeah."
17149.0,Patient,she's like oh my God. This is so saying how. Much is the muscle go.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. let's see part of the process, we have to learn to, we have to seek and then make amends, but at the same time, we have to forgive ourselves at the end of the day, too, because we're human we make mistakes. We can you know learn from the mistake, what did you learn from the experience. How can you correct it so that moving forward. You don't make that kind of mistake again so that doesn't cause upset in your relationships and and even just in yourself the way you feel about yourself, for having done that. Carlos are you frozen."
17149.0,Patient,I just need to get. Out of my head to the slide. missing out on something. Like your different experiences by staying person yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so thinking that maybe. Maybe, is there a part of me that doesn't feel ready to be in a committed relationship."
17149.0,Patient,"That. it's already back your fourth of that that happens. yeah like cuz i'm telling you like I. Was he wants a curse I know how to talk to you so well you know. Why so many opportunities to people. Like talking with other women in order to. be able to like. You know, like. Like passing these other people, you know. Like oh yeah."
760.0,Provider,"There is a part of you that thinks that. experience. Other relationships, in other words. You are still pretty young. That we have different ways of looking at things we can have. conflicting feelings about something you know this part that wants it this way, and this part that wants it the other way and and that's part of life, and you have to kind of. Choose I mean because we we can't have we can't have both so we have to kind of choose and and when we choose one side there's a trade off for the other side and it's important, to be honest with yourself to make sure that you're okay with that trade off. That makes sense."
17149.0,Patient,mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,it's normal.
17149.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"you're actually in relationship. relationships are like up and down i've been married to my husband. Carlos 25 years so. So I i've seen the beginning. The Middle i've seen I seen the happy times i've seen. The the problems, and you know relationship is not just like all great."
17149.0,Patient,"You know, takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of work."
760.0,Provider,"And, and you know you guys need to evolve together if that's if if this is the relationship, if this is the path in your life that you want to continue going that this is the partner that I want to share my life with if if that's what that is and you. can only you can decide that. But it's not a straight line up and it's not all great all the time and and. You know if you if you make it long long term like that, then you know it's, you will have your ups and downs."
17149.0,Patient,"Like. This is to me the downside, right now, the downside by adele."
760.0,Provider,"definitely yes. Definitely. But it won't be the last. Sometimes downtime doesn't have anything to do with that kind of you know, like infidelity it could be. down because of. You know. Financial stresses or. family problems or you know. he's not lost anything to a lot of things. A lot of things."
17149.0,Patient,So.
760.0,Provider,"You know it's like in life is like that, even just you yourself with your career. Financial you know you have to have your ups and downs and just. You know, looking at that building a motivation. Working on that kind of keeping your goals. You know, focused and and making sure that you know not that you're going to do everything perfect because you know, maybe you'll procrastinate some but to reduce that becomes important. Because, in the long run it reduces your stress."
17149.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
760.0,Provider,"is important now life is stressful enough without us adding to it, but I think we humans, we tend to add to it."
17149.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,make sense.
17149.0,Patient,"yeah makes a lot of sense actually. Take a breath for sure, a little bit."
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes, maybe, maybe look and maybe sometimes you have a tendency to be a little hard on yourself. That can feel overwhelming, and that can rob us of our motivation to."
17149.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
760.0,Provider,"So working on the way we're thinking you know how am I thinking about myself in my head becomes really important. Because if i'm really super hard on myself then up there's a little part of us that wants to be a little rebellious. yeah you know, even though it's me doing it to myself i'm going to be rebellious so let me go do this thing that I really shouldn't be doing, because I really should be doing something else. doesn't matter for me and my goals my health or my mental whatever it is."
17149.0,Patient,My relationship mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,So it's important to work on the way you think about we think about ourselves.
17149.0,Patient,That different plays a lot in the whole forgiving myself.
760.0,Provider,"And there is a process to making amends but, at the end of the day. You have to get forgive yourself. And she has to forgive her. She has to forgive you. Otherwise, how is the relationship going to sustain in the long term."
17149.0,Patient,And I have to choose. Another The other thing.
760.0,Provider,And you both but you both have its forgiveness for both.
17149.0,Patient,mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,Not just her.
17149.0,Patient,jaw yeah. know that that definitely plays another roadblock I was making. Like having to choose either staying with her or other. relationships.
760.0,Provider,And sometimes you know you can have a person who's right for you and you can also have a time that. You can have. You can be involved in a relationship is either right or wrong for you. With the person the personality and your personality. And then you can have a time in life that's right and as long as. They I think it's. kind of a combination of the two.
17149.0,Patient,I don't really subscribe to this one person on the entire planet for.
