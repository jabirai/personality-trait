7677.0,Patient,"So in between sessions, you just pretty much pick right behind him picking up picking everything up yeah yeah."
540.0,Provider,"yeah so as long as I just kind of like run upstairs do the thing and then come back. Oh gosh but it's yeah it's I mean it's a game changer to working from home now so it's I mean if if you ever can like have the opportunity, even if it's like working half from home half not. or just yeah it does change like Bam sphere, like motherhood and jangling."
7677.0,Patient,yeah oh I can't yeah you can't really communicate to the kids no i'm you know i'm kind of off duty right now so. don't bother me.
540.0,Provider,"yeah there's only been certain instances where whether or not like one of the kids takes a toy from the other one, and then they want to go get mama and. yeah like I can't do this right now."
7677.0,Patient,"Yes, so i'm thinking that. I definitely do want yeah and i've looked at the university that you recommended so i'm still doing research on everything, but I definitely feel like I need to do something, because. I like to stay busy, but if I have a hard time motivating myself to like kind of stay busy it's almost like I need to have something. I don't even know if it makes that makes sense, but I think, since I love school, I think it will really help you know, keep me keep me busy and active because I just i've just been struggling with like just chronic fatigue, it feels like and just low energy levels and. Some postpartum for sure some weeks are good, some weeks or not some days you know it's just this yeah struggle, so I feel like, if I had something like a goal, a goal definitely helps me yeah."
540.0,Provider,"And so I mean your hormones they're still in a fluctuating are you still are you still breastfeeding. yeah Okay, so I mean, so my experience when it came to breastfeeding, and the older that my son guy sometimes like the less that he needed the breast and the more he ate food the hormones, like, I felt them fluctuate so I felt them going up and down. So that may be something that you may experience as you go on so just making sure that you keep even do they do, they give you any like of like the breastfeeding like advocates or any like the nursing."
7677.0,Patient,"um I do with so I know that they have lactation consultants. Talk to you yeah. Oh, you went, can you hear me. Lucy. Can you still hear me."
540.0,Provider,I can hear you now.
7677.0,Patient,"Oh, there we go okay."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, good um so yeah so the lactation consultants, they can kind of like work through that with you, and like they can tell it to you in a certain way of like what your body is doing. But the postpartum you've struggled with that on and off since right."
7677.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"how's The self confidence i'm going have you been able to work out still. Like for the last few days. Okay, good."
7677.0,Patient,"yeah actually i've been working out with James so he's that's something that we've been doing together, which has been really fun. And, and that definitely makes a big difference, but this past week there was just my my grandma passed away so I was just on the phone a lot just kind of emotional. um so we didn't so I feel I feel that as well that lack of that exercise because it just seems like as soon as I exercise man, the mental health, it just makes such a difference. So um yeah we'll get that started start it back up on that um and yeah i'm taking an antidepressant and I have hypothyroidism so I take medication for that, but it just feels like there's no cure it almost just feels like you have to just kind of go through."
540.0,Provider,"That and that's the hard thing with postpartum and just the fluctuation of your hormones, after having a child, some of it is working through it and just trying to get through the motions of it. yeah finding what's going to work for you. Like the working out, making sure that there's the priority but you're also human life happens, and how are you doing with your grandma did you guys have services."
7677.0,Patient,"know it literally just happened so she got cremated getting cremated and then we'll do a ceremony, and maybe a month or chill out when it's people feel safe to travel. Okay yeah."

540.0,Provider,someone like at peace with what she was what was she's struggling with I mean her a ensure just.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah just her age and she had chronic abdominal pain that they couldn't identify. And and just severe back pain, she broke her back when she was in her 40s and so yeah but she was she was going to turn. I think 90 this November oh yeah and if she had problems up. holding her weight putting weight on she was, I think, when she passed away, she was 89 pounds yeah you know she just couldn't gain weight. Anyway, so but yeah she was in a facility so they were able to give her pain medication and. i'm good good and she had family all around so."
540.0,Provider,Was the facility near you I don't.
7677.0,Patient,live in Texas next to close to Austin that's where my my parents live in my my one of my sisters so.
540.0,Provider,yeah so so what made I don't think we've talked about what made you go to California.
7677.0,Patient,"um well i'm from California on and. we've kind of i've kind of looked at kind of everywhere, but when I was applying to colleges, because I went to junior college, first, I decided to go to to apply to Chico state up here up North northern California, because my sister. That i'm really close with Tonga lived lived here and soda my mom and dad and then the paradise fire happened that huge fire, and so my we all lot my parents and my sister lost their homes, and so I relocated to my parents to Texas my sister to the coast."
540.0,Provider,And did they pay for the relocation or.
7677.0,Patient,Oh yeah they.
540.0,Provider,Are some.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah okay yeah it was. I mean, I wish it didn't happen, because I have like nothing no memorabilia no family pictures no baby pictures like nothing so that's really sucks so but. It did help my mom and dad i'm finding it financially they're they're really they're set up, you know, and then it helped my sister and her husband by like their dream house in Fort bragg on the coast so yeah good a good nice good. Things came out of it."
540.0,Provider,yeah from the bad terrible.
7677.0,Patient,"Yes, and nobody died so that's because there was a lot of deaths, but um. yeah so, then I everybody moved and i'm still in college, so I just stayed here, and you know, then I met James and I met him right when the fire happen and so yeah just stayed here, but I definitely don't feel attached to this part of California at all, I would like to."
540.0,Provider,find other horizons. Especially that your family has moved so it's sometimes like that is like the push where it's like okay I don't have like those strings holding me here so.
7677.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
540.0,Provider,And James does is he from California.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah he's from this area so via all his whole family lives in this in this area and his mom and his dad passed away. decade ago, so and they're all close so that's Nice and they're awesome they're really great family. So that kind of keeps us here to keeps him, you know."
540.0,Provider,rounded there.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah yeah but definitely he's open he, like he loves to travel so he's open up open to a move and experiencing something different."
540.0,Provider,Well that's the thing too is you can always make your way back so it's. A side that finding you don't know until you try.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah I told him we need, we should do it now, before 80s and start school, you know cuz we have the luxury of. You know, doing that right now."
540.0,Provider,yeah like that flexibility versus later on. Because then she's gonna be the one that's like no I don't want to move. My friends.
7677.0,Patient,"Here, like oh. yeah sure sure um but the self esteem I didn't really answer that I it's dead, it is going better. I mean, I feel like I I feel like I definitely am still insecure about like my physically about my body right now just post baby, but I doing those positive affirmations and i've been taking care of myself spiritually more like taking time out for me and. And really like just reading. The Bible, and so that's just been really boosting myself is deep and and it's been great for me emotionally, you know it's like I I struggle with. I constantly think about my past failures and regrets and it's like the overpower me and it's like I have to have something on at all times, especially at night. I have to have like the TV on or be listening to something or else my mind just goes there and it replays the failures over and over and what if what if what if i've done this, what have I done that. And that's just I can't do that anymore, because I just feel like i'm drowning and. So you know, I was praying about it and I just got this urge it was like a few days later, I just kind of got this urge to read. Samson and delilah you know just the story, and I just and ever since i've been reading that i've just noticed that it's kind of been like edifying my mind, and that when. During those times when i'm alone or it's silent, instead of thinking my past regrets i'm kind of thinking about the scriptures that I just read in the story and just you know so that's been that's been awesome and I want to keep that up."
540.0,Provider,"that's on and it's amazing because it's something that you can do anywhere so as long as you have that scripture with you that, yes, that's great."
7677.0,Patient,yeah So yes.
540.0,Provider,"Because you can't always work out, you can. You can go sit in the bathroom for five minutes and."
7677.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly. Exactly so um but yeah I know when I when I take care of myself spiritually I just feel so much better. So and that's kind of been ignored for a while. yeah."
540.0,Provider,Have you been putting time in for like you and James at all like throughout I mean now that he's home to like any certain time that you guys get out of the House or.
7677.0,Patient,"um we haven't his mom usually babysit and she's been gone she just got home, but she was in Wisconsin for a month visiting his sister so. yeah we just haven't been able to yeah exactly I mean, I guess, we could have we could have gotten somebody else, but I just didn't think about it so um. But she's gonna watch the baby this weekend for a couple hours and we're going to go out to dinner but yeah we don't have any set time yeah so usually we just our pillow talk, or you know when she's napping will hang out."
540.0,Provider,"Well yeah Okay, so I mean it's completely different so he's home is it full time now right now until he finds that job."
7677.0,Patient,um What do you mean oh like is the home.
540.0,Provider,icon constantly.
7677.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Nice Okay, so all right so that's the difference because you're not just there."
7677.0,Patient,"it's been a big yeah it's been a big help it's you know it's yeah both of us working with her so i've been able to get more rest, which means to make me more fatigued I don't know but um. But yeah it's been good at you know and we're really good about giving each other, like our own time on our own space and. yeah."
540.0,Provider,Knowing like the balance it'll be like a good indicator to just being able to work together before he gets that like career a gag for you guys to learn like this balance learn your juggle as parents. And it's a new stage of your relationship being together marcia grows yada yada.
7677.0,Patient,"it's kind of like we're finding our roles which is sometimes it's a struggle with us, you know, like. So my expectations were kind of having to let go of expectations and compromise and yeah."
540.0,Provider,What do you feel like you've learned most with him being home like about him as like a dad.
7677.0,Patient,"i'm. Definitely. To keep by if he's doing something to not micromanage him that's you know to so that he builds his confidence. um and. No, I don't know i'd have to really think about that. yeah I know."
540.0,Provider,"As a partner is there anything that like has stood out to you that he does or anything like that, now that he's been home."
7677.0,Patient,"I don't know anything has really stood. out. But it's becoming more obvious that, like he does love to work, so I think this is a bit of a struggle for him we love being home with ED but he's like he's. A crawler. yeah yeah, so I think you know he kind of gets a little stir crazy there and I think i've learned that I need to learn how to push him without being. Like push him using the type of communication that works for him so not nagging but just trying to find some way to communicate with him that really motivates him. and T whenever we talk about something big or we have a fight, you know he's not quick on his feet, he needs time to take a space and think about things, for a long time and then come back so being patient with him okay."
540.0,Provider,Have you learned what best way is like to communicate things with him.
7677.0,Patient,"um. Yes, and no definitely still struggle with it, but I think when i'm. Really kind of calm and let him take it take as much time as he needs to speak and explain things that really helps when I tell him, you know how i'm feeling use I statements, a lot. And then that helps as well, so."
540.0,Provider,I know where. Does he do it for you to has he been I learning ways to communicate with you.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah he works on it for sure he's one of those guys that he stuffs things and doesn't talk about his emotions. And so I mean since we've been together he's been like that, obviously, but anyways he's since we've been together till now it's it's he's gotten a lot better, and I know he still works on it, but it's just not it's not an innate you know within him. To just kind of like this is how I feel. So I definitely have to read us moods and sometimes be just kind of be intuitive and be like okay you don't like this do or this isn't what you want, is it so. that's gotten better every. yeah. yeah encourage him to just speak up because yeah. So we're definitely opposite on that issue for sure."
540.0,Provider,Are you more transparent and his.
7677.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
540.0,Provider,it's guarded a little bit yeah.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah yeah but yeah if you read it, but his whole family's like that, so it makes sense, where my whole family is very transparent and his whole family's very just kind of yeah reserved reserved yeah but are waiting for."
540.0,Provider,"And, most of the times that's that's usually where it comes from is, if you look at someone in their reactions and the way that they manage and cope and honestly anything that you do look at the family and usually you'll be able to see where it came from. yeah yeah."
7677.0,Patient,"Yes, for sure so. yeah and. But yeah it's still you know we talked about marriage a couple days ago and that went That was a good talk it's something I really liked and his parents got divorced, so I think he has some fears about it and. it's a big move, and when a lot, a lot of things are on his plate, you know he gets overwhelmed like baby find a new job possibly move, you know marriage it's just, but one thing. yeah and um so, but we did talk about it and I kind of said, my expectations, he said, his expectations, and we really were on the same page so that felt really good. to know."
540.0,Provider,"So, what are you guys at for expectations like what are has one of yours."
7677.0,Patient,"Well, my expectation is that once he gets a job and starts working a little bit and we get settled that I would like to you know make that commitment to him. And I don't want a wedding I just want like a courthouse, but I want to say those bows and and be that family unit. um well, we are family unit, but you know what I mean it's just important it's important to me um and with him he's the same way, he feels like. He if he will only make that commitment, if he's providing financially, because the thought of getting married and not being able to provide just. doesn't sit with him so or it's just too much stress, so he wants the same thing wants to settle get everything settled in and be making good money and then and then yeah."
540.0,Provider,So kind of looking at the responsibility of it as well.
7677.0,Patient,"So yeah balance, yes, but it took a long time to get that out of him, you know, because it was just it's almost like he was processing his his box to and so. yeah."
540.0,Provider,I know you said it's been like someone's like a touchy subject just because of like everything that he had to do for school and it was just you guys had ev and then it just one thing after the other.
7677.0,Patient,"yeah and my relaxed, you know, a year and a half ago which. You know, I was reliving together, and I was using, for you know, six months and lying to him and and then he you know was with me while I went through the detox process which was horrendous I went through. Something withdraws when you take the suboxone and it rips off everything and."
540.0,Provider,I like the just like fast withdrawal or two.
7677.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah which was just horrible so it's just a it took him a long time to process all that and process like how I would like to him and he was using drugs around him and did a bit of that and so. That we had to really work through that and yeah it still affects me, you know he's still like it's still scary to him. i'm being with an addict in a you know, in a sense, just that that might happen again so but yeah. But that's understandable."
540.0,Provider,"But also, I mean being able to have that understanding, where. Does he understand like, to the extent like why you're lying to him, though, like okay all right yeah."
7677.0,Patient,"He he doesn't really understand addiction and is sympathetic to it and understanding so. You know, but still hurt him, and you know, obviously, and. But you know I told him well like you could cheat on me, you know, or you could. Do something there's always going to be something that one of your partners could do you know there's always the possibility there's always hears yours might be for me to relax mine would be that you lead me, you know so."
540.0,Provider,"And it's always I mean there's always something that someone can do that can hurt you, especially those that love you there's always something that can happen. Yes, it's got to be worth that risk. of love I think that's really the risk of loving someone is the fact that you can get her."
7677.0,Patient,"yeah and taking those chance in those risks, you know and not like I told them I don't want to be with somebody who just lives in the old comfort zone or fear doesn't take risks because they're just you know too scared. So. um anyways just being able to we just really it felt like we worked through something, and so that felt good. yeah."
540.0,Provider,"I really do think that at least you guys have this time right now to be able to work on those things to be able to I mean you have the time, so you might as well take and just enjoy each other."
7677.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,The presence of the family and just take it in.
7677.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's what I tell them to i'm like you're going to be working for years and years and years, you know, three, four months is nothing."
540.0,Provider,"and You guys are getting into like the like crazy amount of changes that she's going to start showing you like you guys are. Like the next few months, like they go by so fast, but she's going to start showing like new things each day. And it's but it's like the perfect time to it's just to take everything in."
7677.0,Patient,that's awesome yeah she's definitely the light of our world. Everything.
540.0,Provider,Is gonna pour pretzels. feel you're gonna be at work by then so.
