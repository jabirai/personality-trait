6497.0,Patient,"This week i've been kind of a bit bad like that leaves us let's like three days. I guess you can kind of See also like I didn't fill it out that well it's all kind of red and orange. And I. Yesterday I kind of like didn't get out of bed for like a long time, I thought I was sick or something but. seem better today I don't know I thought, maybe got like a like a cold or something but. I couldn't get out of bed. And then, today I was also. feeling weird I don't know not not very. I mean I just woke up like two hours ago but. But i'm still not woken up. Now I feel like I just woke up like five minutes ago."
416.0,Provider,"Something that something's going on with your energy level for sure, but is it um is it connected your anxiety to i'm confused."
6497.0,Patient,"I don't know. I don't know if I can pinpoint it okay. I know I mean there's there's a couple things that i've been feeling anxious I kind of bad about like ago my. my sister messaged me, I guess, and I was like 10 days ago and I haven't replied. birthday wasn't the second and I simply like a happy birthday message pretty late because I always send messages separately, because i'm not awake during the day and then i'm trying to get to stop and then bye bye when I get to send in the message is like 10pm or something. So I sent out like a happy message and then she she can reply, like, I think the next day saying like thank you and then like house you're sleeping because that was my previous message. Oh, I think there's little so I relate to, because it was something about either to work she sent me a. So something about us she talked to a company from a quarter because she's in a quarter right now."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, she has time difference, too, I see."
6497.0,Patient,"yeah it's three hours yeah so that's also why I was late, I wasn't that late here when I sent them, but it was later yeah um. But yeah she was visiting this year, and she said that she met someone that that works at a at some company then has some office this year and offices there and. If i'm interested in in some software thing that she could give me their message so, then I put on my list to like look at the company, so when I kind of looked at it. But it didn't seem like that that I wasn't sure what they do that much and it didn't seem like that interesting that much I was going to look more into it. But then I kind of been a replay and then she said, like. Like no. And then, a system like muscle we haven't gotten to this because most of us has been messed up. And I had been sure that was that was like at the beginning of the month, that it was all messed up basically like right now. And I haven't gotten to it. And then afterwards they got better and that she sent me a message like saying after the happy birthday, she said. As you're sleeping going, and then I was gonna say that I got kind of better, but then I didn't reply and then I haven't replied until now. And it's been 10 days. And i'm. So I don't know I don't know it's like."
416.0,Provider,Are you and your sister close. Usually.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah kinda. we've just been more apart, but we're fairly close."
416.0,Provider,Is is it just the two of you are there other kids.
6497.0,Patient,"were many it's a. The two of us are the only ones from my mom and dad. But then they got separated, when I was like. Like one and a half years old, or something good and then each one had their own families and on my mom's side I have like to also have siblings. And then, a couple step siblings that. Are I guess they're not my step siblings anymore actually she got married. A year ago, two years ago, something like that, and I think that the husband has a kittleson so you got to have another step brother that I haven't met. So she has to have to have siblings here but it's only three have similar to forget about the smallest youngest one which is 13 now."
416.0,Provider,And are they all in Ecuador.
6497.0,Patient,"Know they're all here, and then on my dad's side there in Ecuador. And there's still."
416.0,Provider,Two so did you move here with that side of the family.
6497.0,Patient,yeah with my mom.
416.0,Provider,uh huh.
6497.0,Patient,"She moved here when I was 10 and I came here for one year, with her. And that's kind of where I learned English and then I went back after year and then I came here when I was like 16 to stay with her."
416.0,Provider,gotcha gotcha and are you and your mom close.
6497.0,Patient,"i'm kind of we were kind of closer, but I. haven't really talked about much. i'm actually just talked to her. The day before yesterday. And I hadn't talked to her before but."
416.0,Provider,She didn't exactly she like in the barrier to.
6497.0,Patient,Now she's in Chicago.
416.0,Provider,Oh.
6497.0,Patient,yeah or Chicago suburbs.
416.0,Provider,Do you ever. Go to see them or.
6497.0,Patient,"I did two Christmases ago. Almost exactly two years. Okay, so we're kind of talking about that I should I should move back there stuff because i'm not doing anything here."
416.0,Provider,So is that something you're considering.
6497.0,Patient,yeah kind of. But I don't know.
416.0,Provider,How would you feel about it.
6497.0,Patient,"A bit like I failed. That I there were a few things that I went to do here is that I haven't. Vegas shouldn't stop but it's been three years that have been here I was planning to be here for one year. At a circle back. With them and also the pandemic happen, which we put everything harder how my plan was to maybe meet people or something wrong here which that made it more difficult, but maybe less unexcusable so maybe working the same if it didn't if they say my room all the time, anyway."
416.0,Provider,Right yeah I think we talked last time about you know opportunities for you to kind of go out and meet people. But you hadn't really done much of that.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah I did go to Berkeley like less we were computer labs and there was thinking of like trying to go there a bit, but I haven't really thought much. There was a good. Well they're like Oh, we thought was a week or something."
416.0,Provider,"So, are you going home for going back to Chicago for Christmas again this year, you can stay in the Bay where but what's your plan for the holidays."
6497.0,Patient,"I don't know I kind of wanted to we actually didn't really talk about that she didn't invite me. He said, I mean that I should like go back to like live there with like my sister or something. But she didn't specifically say anything about going to put the holidays. didn't come up at all."
416.0,Provider,"Does she usually invite you like, is this. I guess, do you need an invitation is my question what people wouldn't necessarily feel like they needed in the TV show."
6497.0,Patient,"yeah that's the thing i'm not sure if I need one, so the Sheriff is imply that I could just go and that's why didn't it wasn't mentioned. yeah what."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
6497.0,Patient,I feel like maybe I would a bit.
416.0,Provider,"I mean if you don't have big salad and here when I go because it's been a while, since you said three years since you've been over there."
6497.0,Patient,"Two years but three years that i've been here, because there was a busy day or Christmas."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, two years right gotcha. um."
6497.0,Patient,"it's going to be three years that have been created the bail bonds. was for eight months in Ecuador before that are created three years. Right now that I left to go. live from to cover went to Ecuador. to visit, supposedly for like a month. Then I say there for like eight months, and then I came here for an interview. Out there were thinking Oh, maybe i'll say for like a year, or something. But."
416.0,Provider,Going back to Ecuador.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah cuz usually I go visit, like every year or two. Now it's. Three years. But then my parents came to to Chicago to visit me. up here. And I went to see them there. But I did see them also during this three years. Old so about two years ago, I think. yeah."
416.0,Provider,You post your dad or would you live with your. sister.
6497.0,Patient,"Now my they all live together there, so my my dad and my siblings. They with them, I guess. There wasn't one year that I didn't stay with them, because they had some issues with with my stepmother the previous year, or something. And then the next year, when I went them with That said, like oh you and maybe stay at the at the older house, which is where he has his office. So I stayed over there. But is there enough, that was a while ago."
416.0,Provider,Do you still have the same statement.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah. And we. We get along pretty well. Just once in a while we have an argument. and actually did have one last time that I was there. But then what's kind of find out through that and it was just something stupid like guys stayed out partying all night and then I got back, and I was some kind of drunk and then she started getting on my ass about something and I worked as a bit of a decal so. Like answering to her. that she started her back. With them."
416.0,Provider,"So you have you have a lot of people who love you and care for you, it sounds like they're you know they're just pretty far away."
6497.0,Patient,far away guys.
416.0,Provider,Right. Exactly.
6497.0,Patient,that's right. And the reason why I kind of wouldn't do that because I feel like I shouldn't be moving around or doing trips and stuff and trying to maybe focus on other stuff and getting my stuff together instead. I should have been planning on. Moving and doing all the sudden just maybe stay in one place to. Try to know this stuff.
416.0,Provider,What do you think you.
6497.0,Patient,"don't ever more opportunities somewhere else. Work wise. I don't think so. that's what I was saying, my mom or dad that better don't think it would be better in any work wise going there, it would be just nice to be closer to family or something. And then I I kind of told her something that own. that it would be. That would be nice, but then i'm not sure what to think. Oh, that that it that it would or wouldn't be really be better because sold software jobs so would probably be remote, so, if anything, would be kind of better here, which is, though, that tech hub of the world."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6497.0,Patient,"Although everything is remote, but still, it might be a kind of better here."
416.0,Provider,well. Like but then I don't know better. It is networking opportunities right that you're pretty cut off still I think from. I think the only benefit of actually being physically here would be networking.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah but then I also feel like it's a bit like motivation wise that I feel like i'm here near although. Although headquarters of Google and, like all the big companies that they're like right here. And if you're like Oh, everything is like right here, I should. join them kinda I don't know."
416.0,Provider,"But. yeah but, like you said mess to those positions are remote now."
6497.0,Patient,"yeah. And I said something like that, I mean it might be kind of better here or something I don't know, but then i'm not sure if it would be worth. Sacrificing my family for for that or something about for my career, I feel kind of bad that I said it that way that i'm going to be sacrificing my family. I don't know how she took that. Because I got that. name is on it kind of harsh that didn't mean it that way."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean those are some some big decisions."
6497.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,lots to think about I mean if you were going to consider moving back to Chicago it would make sense to go. Go visit and hang out for a little bit you know you haven't been there for a while.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah who would be nice. But I don't know, since the beginning of the year, without thinking about it and I haven't gotten to it."
416.0,Provider,gotcha.
6497.0,Patient,So time apart for for making that trip and I don't know if I should do that.
416.0,Provider,"So what. You said you went to Berkeley the other day, to get out a little more and hang out what did you like. Just hanging out there, it is you."
6497.0,Patient,"Well, the plan was to go to like. A computer labs that they work there are like the libraries."
416.0,Provider,With my computer yeah.
6497.0,Patient,"I just kind of be. And then yeah I got a chance to talk to people or something just going to. socialize. You might see some cute girls, or something."
416.0,Provider,Right.
6497.0,Patient,"But I ended up. The time I went ahead and not really working much like walking around and then trying to find like like get to know the libraries and then walking from one to the other. Making like a map of where they are which ones are better once were to say it, or the book and by the time where I got somewhere was already kind of late and what's the word for like an hour or something like that to me. Oh no actually I worry a little more, because then it, I was planning on leaving earlier, but then I stayed later because of that. And that's kind of what happened with my. With my sleeping so that I might like to run the southern end and later i'm like what did I do what I was going to do is sit down and do it, then it later."
416.0,Provider,yeah it just becomes and not only thing right.
6497.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,So what. What do you want to have is some calls this week. For the next couple weeks I guess. What would you like to work on.
6497.0,Patient,"Well, I got up to. The apartment and. If i'm wrong here and try to get this sorted out, and they still haven't touched them instead of giving them a call but they didn't reach them. And then also circumspect critical moving thing because I was trying to apply to an apartment years ago, but now it's been like among I think that's I mean sorted out and."
416.0,Provider,And for the rent.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah before I was trying to work out with them, or something figure out something to be good. But um. But then it kind of salt. And then I haven't heard back from them. So it's both for like getting another apartment maybe see if it would be possible to get it with the rent forgiveness. or otherwise here and get forgiveness for the previous month with. Terrible meets. This place. Work all that out and fill out the paperwork submitted state and things like that. yeah and then. They say they were in a hurry, but then now. I haven't heard from them. I also took a bit send them my scope, because I wasn't I went to kind of plan it a bit better, but then up there it's me that I haven't heard from them in a few weeks. But then like I said it was to get up to get another apartment. i'm not sure if I should go back. We should cover something."
416.0,Provider,So I mean you have options that's the Nice part right.
6497.0,Patient,"Yes, good. That is good, but if anything would happen, I got. there."
416.0,Provider,yeah. yeah I mean always good to know that you have family to fall back on and places where people want you to be there and.
6497.0,Patient,I know that it's a good point that I haven't been thinking about. That i'm basically guys right no complaining that I have options. Have you looked at it that way.
416.0,Provider,"yeah right, we can flip the script on that and be like oh Okay, we got this this is pretty cool."
6497.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah Nice.
6497.0,Patient,"But then also just in general, like I said this last few days i've been feeling pretty low. Like mood boards and stuff i'm not sure what's going on and I guess I missed the word for. and maybelline cannot depresses us a couple days, so I know I was sort of like a few weeks ago that we can talk about it, they kind of was like and then episode and then I kind of came out of it. And now I feel like I mean might be falling into one again. No, no."
416.0,Provider,"well. I mean it definitely could have to do with your sleep schedule, but it could also. could also just be some seasonal depression, I can't remember if you if you've."
6497.0,Patient,"done that, I mean it's been pretty cold and rainy there's less than three days every computer beth and that's also one of the reasons why I don't want to go back to Chicago because of the weather super cold, there is the one that does something like that does affect me."
416.0,Provider,remind me you haven't talked to Chantal about this have you.
6497.0,Patient,I talked to her last time. About.
416.0,Provider,feeling depressed.
6497.0,Patient,"And then I talked to the same thing that had told you that I feel like. It might be just like a short thing, and I feel like i'm coming out of it, so I don't know if medicine would be necessary, but what do you think I called her and then she kind of said that. She from what she sees that I kind of think things through, and the if I think that then she'll just go with it. Okay, I guess, this you're gonna really given an opinion on it, she connected to send that. Was. that's them."
416.0,Provider,"So you guys kind of left it up in the air, like it could go either way."
6497.0,Patient,"it's you kind of say that you would just go with what I say, can. That means that if she thought that that. I was coming out of it or something that might be a sure thing that this book then she'll go with what i'm saying."
416.0,Provider,"So, are you rethinking it or."
6497.0,Patient,"No, no me."
416.0,Provider,Get cements.
6497.0,Patient,"A little bit especially this less couple days, but then also like after I talked to my mom and then I kind of told her the whole story about that as well as though she said that. She said. That Maybe I should try some some things that that would. Like may prevent things like this happening, like the like the sort of something from happening, and not just that would. pull me out of it, I don't know. But i'm not sure if there would be. Something that would be good for that. Not much I can remember why I didn't like the search rolling when I tried it."
416.0,Provider,Well there's lots of others it doesn't have to be the search really.
6497.0,Patient,yeah tell me what I was thinking that that that could be maybe an option to experiment with some other ones.
416.0,Provider,yeah talk.
6497.0,Patient,"about that. I mean I. don't know what what could be. And i'm sure I mean she was saying, she was saying something that I should talk to you guys to try to. Try different things and try to come up with like better plans of like. What we are trying."
416.0,Provider,"well. i've been doing a lot of this stuff that you and I have already talked about contributes to. Depression right. Lack of sleep is a problem not getting daylight not getting like being outside getting fresh air and sunshine back contributes so um exercise contributes those things are. there. they're all contributing factors and. Sometimes people can come out of like a mild depression, especially mild seasonal depression, you know just by getting more sunlight, in fact, they even makes those, like those bulbs that give you."
6497.0,Patient,kind of yeah.
416.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean, these are all options for you. But I mean you can certainly try doing more of that stuff first before you decided to go the medication route, but you know we've talked about that too."
6497.0,Patient,"yeah but that's going to go a few also. And like I said right now there's I don't see something that I can pinpoint that then as maybe feel depressed but there's many I get a bunch of like small things that maybe go together like. Like you said, the sunlight like. A couple days or something like I woke up when the sun was going down now, when I was awake during the night. was leaving on today's that so it's like completely opposite or. This weekend I. went out for something I went to the dentist and it was a Friday, and then, when I was leaving, and so I went to the grocery stuff and I bought a bottle, just in case for like partying or something or just to have. But then when I got out, it was a first Friday. So i'm. In oakland to every every first Friday."
416.0,Provider,there's like.
6497.0,Patient,"Okay, so it was it was Friday I got to haven't done it for a while I don't know this was like the first one is endemic I think might have been one before that they just started again. But anyway, I just I can just kind of went there with it for a while and it was going to go, but then the model that ago was. Viable lead is kind of points out drunk some of that they're the two and and it was a nice it was Friday night actually mean you have you seen that was here, it was Friday. And that was when it got messed up. So maybe the I drunk I didn't even drink that much like a couple shots. With a beard oh. Maybe like two or three shots or something. yeah I got the alcohol, maybe mess it up a bit."
416.0,Provider,yeah alcohol is I mean outcomes a depressant it's going to make a big difference in your mental health.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah. Then. let's put like we said that sunlight, then a couple times I had mcdonald's is week. Maybe mcdonald's is. Bad for you, I don't think the weather is cold I don't know all of those things, maybe. I don't know."
416.0,Provider,can definitely be other things. Changing this habit makes a big difference. For sure.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah. The only thing I mean with regarding that alcohol, I do like fireable is really good so taking like a couple sips of it. A couple days I don't maybe that had that big of an impact and effect, I don't know making things worse. But it just be very nice."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, are you do you want to try it out drinking for a while, see."
6497.0,Patient,"mean that's what I usually do. It is this time that I got a little bit. About this, so maybe it is. Maybe."
416.0,Provider,"Well it's it's probably not just one thing it's probably a lot of different things right it's probably your sleep schedule and some alcohol and some. You know not getting sunshine and not getting enough exercise, like all of that stuff contributes, so it, you know, making little changes to see if you can."
6497.0,Patient,Put that away.
416.0,Provider,Its way.
6497.0,Patient,"Maybe it would make sense to just put that away, just in case."
416.0,Provider,That went away.
6497.0,Patient,yeah the firewall I mean.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
6497.0,Patient,What.
416.0,Provider,i'm seeing I don't think it's just that I think there's probably other things to.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah but what i'm saying is that because of that, I would maybe be probably makes us do it, just in case."
416.0,Provider,yeah I agree with.
6497.0,Patient,"But although it is really nice and it was. Oh yeah. what's going to help you better got it got one in a while, and I, like the peace. Oh, what can I say also that I changed the medicine. I picked up the wind up no prescription yesterday. actually took it today and. I took it also with a bit of both federal because it wasn't really much like to cap off a little, some of them would appeal. But we'll see how that goes so that's a matter of like an experiment with. One of them, both of them."
416.0,Provider,chantelle talk to Jen.
6497.0,Patient,She checked off with know what What happened was. When I looked up and saw that it can be kind of preset for.
416.0,Provider,me to tell you this.
6497.0,Patient,"I think I mentioned that. Our conversation was kind of short about it. and And then similarly. And I guess it wasn't the same time that we talked about. circling and then she can also said that she would go with. What i'm saying. I think he didn't really know about it, she like looked it up for broken and said that it can be, it can be used so she would be okay with it didn't know too much about this, and she would go with what I what I know about it or no. I mean folks over here when i'd say they can both though I will. prefer to have any any. Negative quick together, but I could I could look it up."
416.0,Provider,I just I mean my interest is just make. sure that you are following Shan tells directions on this right and. You don't get hurt.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah oh good safer. But I got the official versus just one one per day, basically, for both fulfilled by my plan was to start with a smaller dose to work my way up and up to how it. How it affects me and then also. see how it works together with the idol and then get back."
416.0,Provider,To be still around with it that's what it used to.
6497.0,Patient,"mean, I decided today."
416.0,Provider,Right.
6497.0,Patient,"Yes, okay when chantelle prescribed you the new medication."
416.0,Provider,did she say keep taking the adderall also.
6497.0,Patient,"Oh no. I like I said, I think I might have mentioned that I might maybe maybe it didn't mention that I might."
416.0,Provider,"don't do it if chantelle doesn't know about it, because you don't know what effect that can have any like follow the actual directions you experimenting and figuring out your own kind of concoction could be really dangerous."
6497.0,Patient,yeah look up look up a bit more into it that's that.
416.0,Provider,"I don't think you should look up, I think you should email chantelle and ask her that question."
6497.0,Patient,"you're. just giving them. yeah my reason I was at that oh. yeah but I mean, at the same time she didn't know anything about it when I mentioned."
416.0,Provider,yeah but she has access to medical research and information that you don't and she has a background in it.
6497.0,Patient,yeah maybe I mean she has a background your butcher but the exes I mean everything's a lie. But but yeah I mean I should I should probably mention it to her to.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
6497.0,Patient,"My just my reasoning was that I don't I don't want to completely caught off the idol and if something else if it doesn't work, I want to make sure that that if it seems to not be working that can kind of switch back to the lateral or something. Because they could be worse if I just the child and it doesn't doesn't work for something. But. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"This is a conversation, you should have a show and tell. and say what do you think about this plan."
6497.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,And you guys should come up with a plan together.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah. That makes sense, like I said I can I can probably send her email email also."
416.0,Provider,Okay yeah emails great.
6497.0,Patient,Make sure she's there's. She doesn't think there's this. Powerful or something.
416.0,Provider,"yeah perfect that's really great. um. All right, well, I need to let you go it's about that time. You we need one more appointment this month I think right."
6497.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And how are Fridays, for you."
6497.0,Patient,Very good work.
416.0,Provider,"And what about Friday the 31st, but it would be earlier in the day."
6497.0,Patient,What time.
416.0,Provider,Like I could do noon.
6497.0,Patient,It could work.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
6497.0,Patient,"But, though. After the New Year. Do you have some."
416.0,Provider,"After the New Year, I do, but I think we need one more this month first don't we."
6497.0,Patient,i'm not sure I mean I just thought it was a about every two weeks i'm not sure how strict there has to be.
416.0,Provider,"And if it's supposed to you're supposed to be twice a month. So you know they're they're kind of measuring like did you get to in December to January, you know."
6497.0,Patient,"Okay um yeah that works, I guess."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
6497.0,Patient,"All right, I got there no, it was exactly like per month that they were looking at it, I guess i'm because I just assumed, it was like a week two weeks that I should be."
416.0,Provider,worked out that way yeah but.
6497.0,Patient,I mean that's still comes out to every twice a month.
416.0,Provider,Roughly yeah. yeah.
6497.0,Patient,So 30% noon.
416.0,Provider,"yeah 31st. Right. Okay. So i've got you down, did you get your get Italian your side. yeah i'll say."
6497.0,Patient,yeah. So.
416.0,Provider,Any I know that you've been feeling kind of down any suicidal thoughts or anything like that.
6497.0,Patient,"i'm not really. um. I guess just. ready for this meeting, when I was brushing my teeth and then I kind of thought about this question. That in bed that this conversation we will talk, we will talk about this and then. My. And then the question that I should think about whether I have thought about it basically and then I thought about it. For a split second I thought that. could be an option, but then again was like doesn't make sense there's no reason to it, or whatever, but in my mind when there and and. It wasn't too scared of it, I don't. know."
416.0,Provider,"I got my phone was actually doing it, or it was just a thought that popped in your head."
6497.0,Patient,"I got the train of thought which is basically I don't want to have the meeting we're gonna be talking about my depression and. I should have to bring up if I have had suicidal thoughts how I had them I don't think I had but. OK now i'm having one basically so i've kind of brought my mind there. And then I kind of felt I mean that for a split second I thought oh that's an option. But then I was like. Again, I was like nah man i'm just tired i'm just waking up i'm not feeling well this few days. So if i'm thinking of that it's it's it's a doesn't make sense and i'll just come out of it. But for. guys what i'm saying is that for a split second I thought about it and it wasn't like a resounding no in my head for a second. yeah then it was like the logic came in. So i'm not sure if that means anything."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, as long as you don't have a plan, and as long as it's not like popping in your head all the time, I think we're Okay, but if that changes. I want you to reach out right reach out to the suicide hotline or us or i'll be above right."
6497.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I don't think there would be any any plans if I What if I think about I think doesn't make much sense. Just that in the. That. I got that will come anyway so might even if live socks or something i'm not saying that it does, but if it would it would still. wouldn't be a difference to just die right away, or just do it, and then they later I don't know. Just from a nihilistic point of view. Then also. I added to my list my my total is my main task guidance for the day or whatever. memento mori. you've heard of it. No it's like. A reminder handle it, they may like little tokens and had like a little skull and it's like to remember that you're gonna die basically and the point is that that. That to not over complicate your life because you're gonna die anyway, something like that includes and to and to live a happier life because. I don't know the way I see it leaves kind of like. To not get depressed because you're gonna die anyway, anything that is bad it's temporary some something like that I think there's a point of it. And then. I don't know I kinda kind of like it."
416.0,Provider,Right it's more it's less about death and more about. How you want to live.
6497.0,Patient,"yeah but then to remember you're basically to remember that you're gonna die to make your life, the best you can kind of. Exactly. that's the idea, but then, at the same time, like what. When I was thinking about this about this, we said, hoping and then I kind of thought I kind of saw that also. I thought of if. I don't know who makes it worse, to think about that. I don't know if I don't think that maybe it's probably good to remember to not. Think of grandiose plans or things like that that i'm not going to reach cuz i'm going to die in 60 years and I wouldn't eat 1000 for him or something I don't know things like that."
416.0,Provider,"All right, well i'm gonna let you go, I have another patient coming in, so you have a good day and I will see you in group."
6497.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,All right here.
