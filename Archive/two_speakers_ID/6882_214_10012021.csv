214.0,Provider,hey Steve how are you.
6882.0,Patient,doing all right.
214.0,Provider,"Thanks for being accommodating I have, I have a group I do at nine o'clock and I don't know how I created the conflict but i'm glad you open to coming on."
6882.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well, I know, actually, so I thought my appointment was it I even wrote it in my calendar, that it was 530 and. I did my sorry go ahead."
214.0,Provider,"No, no, I it appears at nine and i'm like this is like the second time this is happening it's it's not me so."
6882.0,Patient,i'm not sure.
214.0,Provider,"When we check for October I really got to go back and make sure that those are the correct times that is logging in, as you know."
6882.0,Patient,Right so.
214.0,Provider,How God told me.
6882.0,Patient,It was just wondering real quick so i'm at what point so since i've. Since i've got all my stuff all my all of my tasks so of my surveys all that stuff's in and been doing my meetings with you. So at what point does that two weeks roll over so that i'm not yellow.
214.0,Provider,hold on. let's just let's just look at what. We have to deal with. So this is your chart.
6882.0,Patient,I was actually also wondering it because you mentioned that during group about talking to our counselors about.
214.0,Provider,You know.
6882.0,Patient,Our chart i'm kind of curious as to what it says and.
214.0,Provider,So here is what it says it says. That you have recent. No shows oh let's see how to that. So we had a no show in September so that's accurate.
6882.0,Patient,September.
214.0,Provider,September 2 was a no show see it.
6882.0,Patient,"Well, who was it with. Individual with. I don't think I knew I had one on the set because I could have sworn that I was."
214.0,Provider,Had.
6882.0,Patient,done all of my stuff this month.
214.0,Provider,"So let's let's let's just let will peel it back for them, and so. Then we have a nurse visit that looks like you didn't attend."
6882.0,Patient,A nurse visit. On 917 what's a nurse visit.
214.0,Provider,i'm assuming it's a question here that oren asks you about.
6882.0,Patient,"i've never heard of such a thing. um I did so I just got back the other day from Oregon and when I got back um my UAE Cup was there, and so I will call back to compliance when I get home and do that i'm just."
214.0,Provider,West we're still gonna be pillars back so don't don't.
6882.0,Patient,Know yeah I was just wanting to have that.
214.0,Provider,"Right, so now what we have to do is. looks like we're all good here so far. So for for the purpose of what the thing says it looks like it's clear but here's, the most important part, see this Green."
6882.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Drug screen compliant no action No recommended restrictions for therapy, there is nothing in here that should put you at a limited prescription like four days in a refill he can go out a week he can go out two weeks so you're looking at you're looking at you're in the green."
6882.0,Patient,"Okay um so that's that's awesome to know, because they just so the shun chantelle."
214.0,Provider,right but.
6882.0,Patient,"um she said I got my texts today saying that they call them my meds um, but it was only a partial prescription and then so it was like wait a second why."
214.0,Provider,"Do I. Look at this here, you see this."
6882.0,Patient,weekly appointments recommended it's patient with so it's still wanting me to do more things.
214.0,Provider,"Meaning correct now The other thing that we know is i've done this with you, your pH Hugh nine squares and gads scores are not a problem, actually, they are low, why this keeps doing that I don't know. So there's a note in there already from me, stating that this should be overrode and because shauntel is not your regular."
6882.0,Patient,"Okay, because because, as I was gone."
214.0,Provider,"Right. So when I say it comes back he's going to look at this and X me. Because i'm kind of the compliance guy when we do this. Right kill asked me and i'll say just look at the green he's totally in the green this regard anything else that you may see up here, this is all wrong information."
6882.0,Patient,Okay okay.
214.0,Provider,"So I know it's a little confusing, but this is why I tell people review your charts with your therapist because you may be able to be like Oh, I see, so the system is crappy yeah right."
6882.0,Patient,"Now i'm because I as a tech guy I get it, you know they've got to have a lot of variables for a lot of different types of people so."
214.0,Provider,"So this, this is actually the first system of its kind, the CEO created a system, and this is artificial intelligence, this is an Ai system where it doesn't rely on. A person like me like a therapist putting information it collects all the information. From what it sees the problem is it only can do what it shows, but there are reasons for cancellations, no shows adjustments it doesn't know that. And that is what's creating a lot of the problems and I get it, but I think this is important for you to see because, on one hand, it looks crappy but then all we care about is this one, the prescription guideline. And as you see there's no need for an override because it says you don't have any restriction so Isaiah will do whatever he thinks he needs to do. And shauntel rightfully so he doesn't know you. she's gonna. she's gonna go with easiest to say. You can't have it."
6882.0,Patient,Right yeah no I get that.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and now you were alluding to something else, though, I also think you were going somewhere else with this conversation."
6882.0,Patient,as well.
214.0,Provider,"Because you sent it in two months ago, and we really never like fully talked about it again."
6882.0,Patient,"Right um and i'm not really sure exactly where i'm heading with that, but."
214.0,Provider,"I want to know if you could wait well one was just the right group, but I kind of saw. In between the lines, like you know what when will I do less like how do I, how do I get there to you know walk me through help me get to. You know, because you got a life you're trying to figure out if you're going to go with this venture, and like so are you still interested in knowing if you can get a reduction."
6882.0,Patient,"So i'm actually I i'm kind of happy with the groups, as they are right now. Perfect um yeah I I was worried when they were saying to add the second group, but just because I wasn't sure where i'd fit it in, but I i'm i'm actually doing kind of happy with the groups."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, great i'm glad to hear that. Right, because we know right that we. down here we start to share screen if you can see, I wrote that due to some in in inconsistency this patient will now turn one group a week until a review of this chart by this writer in six months. And it will begin to like 26 so when they're telling you you got to do more groups, they need to go into the chart and see what I wrote. yeah so so we'll leave scheduling the way it is until we need to talk about it again. Okay. Did you freeze. You froze. Steve if you hear me I don't know if you do, but you kind of froze. transcriber it seems that Steve Garland had a connection issue, and he should be back shortly. was a no show on the second is on like that no show on the second. One he was. So transcriber just going back to the discussion I had with the patient Steve garwood it is confirmed that he was a no show on September 2 for an individual session with myself um I think he had misjudged the time, but please make a note of that."
6882.0,Patient,And they're. not sure what happened.
214.0,Provider,"But anyway, I will leave this the way it is."
6882.0,Patient,yeah no I think that's good um yeah. i'm. Good and. I think it's. it's all helping I enjoy going to the group actually which kind of surprises me. I never really would have thought that was.
214.0,Provider,"I get my kind of thing, but I totally get it."
6882.0,Patient,"yeah um. But yeah it's a. really interesting weekend um. So. The person that I was that I jt this friend of mine of several years um who. I wanted to do this, this nonprofit venture with which is still something that i'm going to get involved with some way jt may not be involved, I don't really know what his deal is right now. I don't know if I really went into detail but jt and I, we met on working at this Congressional campaign down in spokane and um we kind of really became friends just one we're. we're both gay we're both geeks were both the you know I mean like yeah he spent most of his life in in the military and um I don't have that side, but we both have a lot of history with depression and addiction and and that kind of. Rejection feeling from our family and stuff like that, and so um you know it was those were all things that really made us close and so. Anyway, we've been talking about this nonprofit thing for quite some time and it was only really just recently it was like let's do it like things are you know um. And then, this last weekend i'm so on Friday I left call Villa Joe left work at 430 had to run home and stuff and I drove south to his house, which is about three and a half hour South um and then the next morning we got up and use his parents rv and drove to bend Oregon. So in two days I drove 907 miles, it was insane and oh my God, I was tired, but we're supposed to go down for four days and. I don't I still I mean i've tried explaining it to like my mom I was talking to her, and I was like I don't understand and jt has gone into his little shutdown mode, which is the same thing that i'm trying to prevent myself from doing on a regular basis, you know. And so. yeah I don't know it's it's really bothering me because jt and I are kind of like we're close enough that we literally like. there's never been boundaries, so the things that we'll talk about are the things that will say, and whatever is bothering him is bothering him enough that he won't even talk to me about it and so like that really scares me because. He can get very self destructive. And so, worse than I could ever imagine myself like I couldn't be, or at least i've never been, I will say I couldn't be i'd be i've been surprised devices that i've been but um. yeah if that's really worrying me, but then on the same side like i'm trying to prevent myself i'm in my last message I was like you know what. Whatever is going on right now, when you're ready to talk to me well, I was like we are friends that. We know each other's problems we know each other's habits of going silent, I was like i'm not angry at you a. Like yeah he totally destroyed the weekend, but i'm not gonna hold that against him kind of thing, and so I wanted him to know that I was just like you know. I will let you talk to me whenever you're ready so he's not ready yet, but I need to make sure that I stopped myself before I throw myself into. Like. Worrying too much about him that it cause problems for myself and that's definitely something that I did."
214.0,Provider,"I think what you need to do is pause one is we don't know what's going on with him right. In all fairness, I know that the shutdown leads us to believe this could be it could be dangerous it's not healthy, but we don't know on his side what's really going on. And the other thing that is most important that you came on said is you know what I can't be jumping into this pool and I don't know if there's any water like I really got to start holding a line between caring but caring more for him to them came from myself I."
6882.0,Patient,being more invested in.
214.0,Provider,"That, and I think all you can do is you know extend the olive branch in hopes that he comes back to some place where he can reach and say listen i'm sorry for the following right, but I think that's that's always a burden when. we're finding a need to be someone savior hypothetically and we're not like they're an adult. If they have issues they can either talk to us or find someone, but like I can't every time you have a leak I can't keep coming over to your House, when my campbell's soup can pick and I can get all the water out so i'm glad that you're aware that that's the danger of this. And it doesn't mean you don't care it doesn't mean. You think less of him, you need to just remember I need to give him space, because the space that I will occupy for myself won't be healthy for me so he's gonna have to have his own space and get to me when he gets for me."
6882.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
214.0,Provider,"Something man is something may have hit a chord this weekend I don't know. I i'm not asking you to tell me whether there was intimacy whether there was you know more than friendship and what I mean by that it couldn't it couldn't start him up to maybe he has abandonment issues, maybe he has issues of trust you know friends trust it doesn't matter gender but. A French trust is very different, and then, once the intimacy plays a role that changes, a lot and they feel vulnerable. I feel vulnerable at depending it doesn't matter, an agenda someone feels vulnerable and the issue here is like to something must have into another world. that's triggered him he'll have to work through that because I have no idea how to get him, through it, because I parlayed to that information right. And I think that's I kind of think that's what happened."
6882.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah it's I don't know if all i've done is I don't know it's really. Like. A little. Right yeah anyway um so that kind of leads to my next part that so my attorney from my car accident last year. called and. I so they finally they got the company up to the Max that they would that they have that they can do before it has to go to a lawsuit. And I saw the mouse like this is already taken 18 months i'm not waiting a lawsuit I just need to be made at least partially whole and what they offered definitely not going to be enough to make whole but um. Anyway, so it ends up basically at $100,000 i'll get just over 50,000 and. I swear like I don't even. I didn't even I she doesn't my mom doesn't even know about this most recent call yet just told her just because of the way she reacted about the first call like she was making plans for spending money that's not hers and that's that's how she always days. Like literally. job I was a paper carrier at 13 years old, and he, like I get my money and it went to her and like it's always been a."
214.0,Provider,"condition we've conditioned this relationship to believe that's the way it should be i'm not saying you agree with it, but that's the way she sees it."
6882.0,Patient,"yeah and every time I try to bring it up. Every time I try to talk about finances in any way, shape or form it just ends up being this explosion of of. Like it's gotten to where it's anger and frustration on my side and my mom is excellent at being the victim and a. In like she's good like I actually I said something to that effect not too long ago, and like she twisted that around as if I stuck a knife in her, and it was like. The whole thing it's I don't know and i'm. i'm worried because, like I need this money to set up my life I have spent my entire adulthood basically living and paying for rent and for all the bills and big literally I got. Like I said she lives with me got home last night, and there was all kinds of toys and stuff that she was prepping for Christmas already and I was like. Where did this money come from and and her money's hey her 700 and whatever dollars, she gets from so security is like it's hers she'll pay one bill whatever that's a she doesn't care, like the rest is hers and who cares about me is what it basically boils down to."
214.0,Provider,And it's true.
6882.0,Patient,Just so i'm really worried that. My willpower as like.
214.0,Provider,"So here's. here's something here's something to think about. You are you are now really tapping into a fracture which is, you will find it difficult to have 50 grand and not give them money that's one. I get it, I, on one hand, I applaud you on the other hand, i'm like Okay, we gotta we gotta figure this out because that'll go quite fast, I mean a lot of money at the end of the day. Can you, and you know either way you're going to you're going to be the villain. Can you. Put your put I don't know 80% of that money into a retirement fund that you can't touch and if you do, you get bang for it. and keep yourself the 20% and say you know what let's just do even numbers let's just say you know what I got 50 i'll put. 40 away i'll take five myself, and I will put five and another bank account, she doesn't know about and feed her that, like you're asking to stop using heroin think about it. You want to go cold Turkey and stop beating mom. I don't know if you could do it and I yeah I don't want you to feel like because it could have a mental impact on you. of not being a good son, how could this son do this, what kind of person like you, you may turn this tables on yourself, but like if you pick a stipend and put it aside for without her knowing it. I don't know you're kind of having a road of setting a boundary but you're also saying you know what this is too painful so i've got to figure out the lesser of two evils that works in my favor."
6882.0,Patient,"Right right that's I actually I like that idea like you know, keeping a nurse."
214.0,Provider,yeah like you.
6882.0,Patient,"need to restrict your song. yeah yeah because in I i'm the first to admit like at my job managing money and stuff here like i'm good at that i'm good at managing money, but when it comes to my personal life oh my God, am I horrible."
214.0,Provider,Because my mom caught because it's different it's not the same.
6882.0,Patient,"yeah. i'm i'm mom was never taught financial responsibility, so we were never taught financial."
214.0,Provider,responsibility.
6882.0,Patient,But it's but as.
214.0,Provider,"You are you are thinking about financial responsibility to give yourself credit for that you're trying to figure out a mechanism in which you really won't have the ability to say no, but you can kind of force yourself. To only provide what you can so it's kind of on the right track, it puts you in accountability she doesn't need to know how much more money there is. And you can feed her escaping and when the stipend runs all you have to make another decision, but you don't have to you know slay the. dragon at this point, you can kind of keep the dragon still around why you figure out what you're going to do, but you blow to the 50 grand and feel like crap and I don't think we can we can play with."
6882.0,Patient,"yeah definitely it's. it's like I just I know that, like with the facts that I like I like I said I really have nothing to show for all the work that i've done for the the amount of money i've made over the years. It during my best payday or my best paying years. It was either the cohabitation and ability to say no, or my my pill addiction and. Basically, create anything but like I have like this $50,000 is not very much and I have to make it last as much as possible."
214.0,Provider,"And that's why i'm thinking so maybe you don't put 40 in a 403 B or five or four see where you got to get hit with 50% penalties, maybe you don't do that. But maybe maybe you'll take 25 and put it in that so if you're going to take it out it's going to hurt. And, and like you know I want you, I want you to know you are responsible, I think you're feeling like I don't know this could be a little tricky for me. So I can't tell you financial obligations, I mean I could be giving you bad advice, but I think putting five grand on the side, for your mom isn't bad advice, what you do with the other 45 I mean you could take that 45 you must have at least another 30 years to work."
6882.0,Patient,yeah. You can.
214.0,Provider,"easily can turn that into between half 1,700,000 if you never touch it."
6882.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So you know I know you may want to do things is like you know I deserve hey we got to feed the beast we got to have candy i'm good with that. But that major portion you've got to just save yourself, you know what if I don't put it away with restrictions on i'm going to lose out on this so that's how I would tell you address them now."
6882.0,Patient,"And I do definitely agree with that. it's and i'm in that's money and me of has actually become like. I don't really like spending money myself I don't like I I hate money it's just become something toxic and I just. And so, for me it would be totally fine to get myself situated, because now, now that I know I don't have to stay in the place with mom until she gets transferred or until she gets her a single place um. It would give me a way to transition into my own place, I want to spend just enough to do that and the rest of it find someone who knows what to do with it. and invest in some way so. that's all I want to do, I just want to make myself to where I can start building my own comfortable life."
214.0,Provider,"I, I think that you know I and. Maybe you don't see it, but this is a big turning point for you. Making responsibility for you forget about everybody else, for now, you saying yourself if I don't start doing for me, this is not going to be pretty like this is a big change feel."
6882.0,Patient,It is.
214.0,Provider,"it's a very event I know. So. I mean, I think that you know if you want to talk more about it i'm more than willing. Because one of the things I do is unfortunately richards i'm not saying you're rich. i'm just saying they don't know how to adjust money and. People hire me to implement certain barricades and Panama canals. So they can't get it, so they only get stipends and departments don't want to be the one giving it out, because then the kids are like you're you're a deadbeat dad you know you got. $3 trillion, and you want to give me 50 grand a month that's not enough and everybody's called dependent what i'm saying is. This is the first time, where you can really make your own future by yourself, meaning, you know what i'm going to start off with X. I need this X to be somewhere down the road is why i'll take whatever I need in the interim, but that it needs to be my key focus i've got to get this money somewhere where it's going to do me justice when i'm ready to go."
6882.0,Patient,yeah that's.
214.0,Provider,awesome.
6882.0,Patient,"Well, I will."
214.0,Provider,Go ahead.
6882.0,Patient,and talking.
214.0,Provider,"I would love to because there is so many different programs this credit cards. That can have so many restrictions that you can't spend it on a magazine you can't buy a cup of coffee like there is so many different aspects of control. Until we know we want to do with it because, once you put it in the investment for retirement, you know you're talking about a 20 20% penalty up front, plus to. The 25% penalty attacks time so it's big man it's been you literally can lose 50% of your money if you needed an emergency so maybe that's not a route. But maybe what I can do for our next session is at least provide you information with links and then you researching and say, well, that that this seems like something I want to continue to find more information about we can do it like that."
6882.0,Patient,i'd like to I really would. be a great help cuz yeah it's they said it's it's only going to take a few weeks for everything to all the paperwork and stuff and so it's like it down but it's it's finally done it's like ready to move and i'm.
214.0,Provider,"You know the other part, right, you need somewhere, to put it. yeah okay. So can can I hit you up on chat on Wednesday, with two dates in October and i'll remember that our first date is just addressing just um you know resources, you can go to to figure out what you want to do that works."
6882.0,Patient,Totally yes.
214.0,Provider,awesome so then i'll see you Wednesday and then i'll provide the two I know the times that work for you or find the two dates and then we'll go from there.
6882.0,Patient,Perfect Thank you very much.
214.0,Provider,"Listen Thank you so much, and listen Keep up the good work."
6882.0,Patient,Thank you. I appreciate it.
214.0,Provider,"you're very welcome, have a good night."
