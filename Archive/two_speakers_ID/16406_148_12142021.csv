148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah well. What was coming up for me, as you were talking was we all do our best, with the understanding knowledge and awareness that we have right so like you first said about your mom Maybe she doesn't understand this. or understand what you're doing, and it could be her way of trying to protect to you like oh don't get your hopes up because we don't know you know we don't know where this could lead you. That was something that I thought of as you were talking when it got to your sister I did feel you know, maybe, she is envious of you."
16406.0,Patient,"Yes, what is it what is envious."
148.0,Provider,No it's.

148.0,Provider,yeah. You don't see that.
16406.0,Patient,Like jealous yeah but it's not so.
148.0,Provider,"may get it right so negative or jealousy has a negative connotation around it so jealousies. And sometimes people portray jealousy is oh I don't want this for you, whereas envious I think of as more of. I don't want to take this away from you, but it's something that I wish I had right I wish I had your. talents or."
16406.0,Patient,"I know the road in in my leg, which is our final mm hmm."
148.0,Provider,"Actually kind of went to look up in envy or jealousy. um. lot yeah and B is more of longing for what somebody else has. Yes, and but jealousy is more of an unpleasant like rivalry right like competition. yeah that's what I was thinking of. Because jealousy could be such a hurtful thing right."
16406.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
148.0,Provider,So i'm sure that you're I mean I can't say for sure cuz I don't know her and I don't know your relationship with your sister but.
16406.0,Patient,"But for so many years, you know, not even. When I moved here when I got a chance when when I was discovered the producer from being said he discovered me on instagram. And then First it was like my mom and my parents, they were saying no those are probably fake fake profiles on instagram Where are you going, then my mom was saying, you need to put your feet on the ground, you are not Leona Lewis beyonce. And then, this happened, and they didn't even know I sit on airplane I I came here to meet the producer and then how I met my husband he's also a mixer engineer, he was mixing agree on and. Kelly Clark, so he got even a grammy and no, no, no, that was that is fake like that cannot happen to you, and they didn't even know when I when I came here."
148.0,Provider,"So it. sounds like it, it sounds like a lack of understanding of what this work is right."
16406.0,Patient,Like I.
148.0,Provider,can't really understand it unless what they're saying is you on the big screens and famous and that's when they might be like okay.
16406.0,Patient,"I think even them or even if I end up being on a New York Times Square up you know, like adele now she will say Okay, did you got answer from sephora will I have that feeling. or she will feel and my sister will not publish it I have that feeling."
148.0,Provider,"Because of what they've shown you, the lack of the lack of support that you've gotten from them as very hurtful."
16406.0,Patient,"To you just to make sure, and then, when I moved here one man from certain where i'm from now he called me to do interview in our language and it ended up that he or he was with my sister in the same school. He was shocked when I gave him the information, and when I taught him, she said, who is death, I said that is my sister she's your sister because they're following each other on Facebook 90% of her friends don't even know i'm her sister. And when I asked my mom why why I don't understand, like the answer was. she's addressing provocative like Jennifer Lopez like beyond saying so, I said and but she's listening to the same that Jennifer Lopez, so what is the difference, but you know if her friends or colleague on a on a. See the time like provocative and you know dressed up any whatever I don't know it's not good like I I don't understand you know it's. I mean it's that the i'm not naked, of course, the show business, then you go and then she going for the thing that Jennifer yeah. You know. Do you feel like it."
148.0,Provider,could be a cultural thing.
16406.0,Patient,concert with you yeah. yeah.
148.0,Provider,So a protective. i'm coming up.
16406.0,Patient,"me but i'm more opposite to when i'm performing you know long dress more like mariah along dance Okay, of course, it's it's like a little bit sexy dress but i'm not like cardi B or nicki me national you know. What cultural though i'm from Serbia yeah."
148.0,Provider,"Could could be a little bit of that too, and you know we could sit here all day and say you know why do why why aren't they giving you support. Around something that you're so passionate about and working so hard for. Have you ever asked them."
16406.0,Patient,"For this is my mommy soon or that's not true and with my sister here and there, we spoke like for how fear now 2123 weeks ago I sent her again a message now we are talking again and talk. Talking fighting talking fighting you know. Like I don't know what I say what I said, and she said, of course, about that girl is like she's a model and she's like 27 years old you're not. And then I was like okay how old is attorney is I mean looking better than me. What the test at, but why that hurt me so much I died on they put me like immediately both of them. So I don't see that Jennifer I see that she said that woman is 27 where I said I don't know I want to change my hair and then she said it was like two three years ago, or must be this middle age crisis. me, though, it wasn't that wasn't that you know."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah. down to are these words are hurtful to you. The following words are painful and the lack of support that you are receiving from your mom and sister is hurtful and painful.
16406.0,Patient,"What can you keep me what what shall I do just my husband always say you need to let go or you know forgive them leave with that or or never or upon you know, there is no."
148.0,Provider,"i'm i'm wondering if we could find some sort of acceptance around. This is who they are, and it may not even be intentional their words may not be intentional to hurt you um but, at the end of the day, what matters is that it is hurting you. So I wonder if it's there could be some boundary set around this that this isn't something it doesn't sound like this is something that you can talk to them about. Because you do talk to them about it, you leave the conversation feeling hurt feeling sad feeling anxious feeling depressed feeling angry and that's not how you want to leave a conversation with somebody you love."
16406.0,Patient,"angry most with my mom angry every conversation stuff like this, like me, a new normal and it end up with somebody doesn't cut she's going up up up up. And I can't then after that it's like i'm completely no energy and the whole the whole days."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
16406.0,Patient,You ever going to see me like she doesn't seem that's now the the right.
148.0,Provider,"And when you're talking about other things, aside from the show business and you're singing."
16406.0,Patient,On or more more more.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so there may need to be a boundary set that where you just. communicate where you're coming from I feel hurt when I talk to you about this. And I don't want to feel hurt, so I don't want to talk to you about this. Right just that communication there and a boundary so that you guys can still have a relationship right but one where these words are not hurting you. Because this is very important to your work is very important to your success is very important to you, and anybody that's not supportive of that. It hurts. Because you. Care so much about it right. Yes, yeah. How does that sound to you."
16406.0,Patient,"Okay, I guess, I guess, I will have to accept. Like."
148.0,Provider,The reason why we need to accept people. Where they're at. Is because we don't have the control to change them. Which is hard right you just want to shake somebody sometimes and say support me.
16406.0,Patient,Love me.
148.0,Provider,"exactly right, whereas we have to meet them where they're at and and accept them. And I feel like. letting go of that resentment. is only going to be healing for you, because holding on to anger and resentment towards your mom or your sister it's not hurting them and."
16406.0,Patient,"You know I think I don't think, by the end of the day, they even think about That to me is how many times, I was crying here after after especially talking with my mom or hall. I don't I don't understand even even that they came here now, we we spoke, and I said Okay, but I got an amazing opportunity also for my daughter look look where I came to live. Also career common goals yeah but look and said yes, but now it will be good if you can double that if you can you know if I succeed like actually doesn't see of all this is access success. Not like you said on a TV or you know millions, you know no money."
148.0,Provider,"yeah and like you said, even then she may not see that it's success, maybe this is not something. that she sees this success. um."
16406.0,Patient,"What is what is that, for her success, being a mom and a housewife or what. or going a normal job and getting some money is that."
148.0,Provider,Something that seems safer for her.
16406.0,Patient,"Right, something that seems safe and secure."
148.0,Provider,"there's a lot of things that are up in the air, with what you're doing and you're taking that risk again because you love it that much but for her it sounds like safe safe a success. that's what i'm hearing you saying."
16406.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,Do you want to. say.
16406.0,Patient,"Maybe it's huge for her, she that she can you know for from where I come from Serbia such a small town and i'm talking with her that I don't know, last month, I was in a studio of selling your producer, maybe for her, that is. You know she doesn't. We I was like. This small when we watch Titanic in in you know, in a small city, we i'm my family's we will never reach and it's it's uh let's say not poor about. four. So maybe. She can. She can understand that maybe. yeah hmm."
148.0,Provider,"And like I said earlier, we all do our best, with the understanding knowledge and awareness that we have, so if she doesn't have the understanding or awareness around what you're doing. It would feel really hard for her to support you in it. mm hmm."
16406.0,Patient,So.
148.0,Provider,"doing her best to keep you safe, I hear that I hear that she loves you very much, and for you to be safe and financially secure."
16406.0,Patient,"Yes, yes that's what she wants, yes, so whenever I talked with her with my sister does not to bring bring this up. What is your idea."
148.0,Provider,"Well, how would that make you feel to not talk about this."
16406.0,Patient,"Point mean, I can but that is me I don't know how I can book."
148.0,Provider,"Because I hear that when you talk about it with them. you end up her. Yes, every time. So it really does nothing positive for you to talk about it to."
16406.0,Patient,"No. nothing, nothing will change like you said. possible."
148.0,Provider,"Because you cannot talk to them about this doesn't mean that you. need to give up your passion, but it doesn't even mean that you really need approval from them, it just means that. These conversations around it, are hurtful for you. And there needs to be a healthy boundary set there so that you're not feeling this pain right because you don't deserve that you're doing the best that you can."
16406.0,Patient,"know. he's the right, I can read the agenda. You know so much."
148.0,Provider,"let's see um. I want to say some affirmation work, just to be content and at peace in knowing that what you're doing. is right for you. and cut getting to a place of peace within yourself. That is so strong that it's okay if other people aren't accepting of what you're doing, because you know that how much you love what you're doing and how. Much it's meant for you to keep going at it right, so I think some affirmation work would be good and somebody you can listen to and I refer her all I recommend her all the time is Louise hay."
16406.0,Patient,Always here yeah I know i'm I even have a book.
148.0,Provider,Oh good.
16406.0,Patient,affirmations yes.
148.0,Provider,"Oh good Okay, so you listen to her and let's see what else um. I mean this really does bring me back to the call to courage by Bernie brown when she talks about being in the arena right and hearing the criticism. But if these people are inside the arena with you, with the blood, sweat tears you remember what she says that quote, that she says, then how can they understand what you're doing."
16406.0,Patient,"No, they were never I mean okay my mom that they were. They put me in a music school when I was six yeah but my sister was never in she doesn't even know. huh. What should."
148.0,Provider,And what is burn a brown say you were the only critics that counts.
16406.0,Patient,"Yes. They should watch again and then write down because it's good for me just to remember in English or. Now, when you're. saying I remember, but maybe I should write down everything like that is important."
148.0,Provider,"And every day that you do this, that you do your singing and your work and you're working so hard to achieve the success, this is your dream right every day you do this you're not choosing a safe route you're choosing courage over comfort."
16406.0,Patient,Thank you.
148.0,Provider,Really gonna get you to where you want to be. yeah.
16406.0,Patient,"So you were your takeaways I want to give me a SEC SEC, the link of my just stay stay there. to share code. Now we are now I go check yeah. The link, so you cannot and then after you can see, when we finished yeah."

148.0,Provider,"Well, I can't I can't."
16406.0,Patient,"not say I many people will not even will say well you're losing your time but but i'm. Over mo. Somebody will say so, what if your sister. Yes, you are here in Hollywood hotel. I can."
148.0,Provider,"Tell if I were to ask you to shut out all your outside influences all the voices in your head, if I were to just sit."
16406.0,Patient,"up for obamacare. I can sign shop all that and, just like this yeah you see that that's your question."
148.0,Provider,"I want you to I want to just sit with you, and nobody else right now, nobody else's opinions, nobody else's thoughts, no, no other influences, what do you want to do. To succeed yeah."
16406.0,Patient,I ended up here.
148.0,Provider,yeah and.
16406.0,Patient,"Is it on the call, many of them is on that instagram. How many and I got the chance to that is really. it's rare."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm so again, you know, in your heart what you're doing is right for you, and this is your path that you are walking nobody else is walking this path. This is your processes your journey. Right."
16406.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
148.0,Provider,And I heard that answer as clear as day. And I don't hear I don't even have to tell you to keep going I don't hear that you're going to stop until you reach your your dream.
16406.0,Patient,"Oh, and in horoscope family or there's no way um but. But I don't want to get myself sick or depressed or anxious or. Now we were talking about my mom and sister, but maybe next you said, there are a lot of people elements I should I should. learn to deal if i'm getting. This is now, not even a music business in Europe, this is this is like the hardest year, you know how how how VP Houston and up, I mean. This is a this is. Any fun Kurt over only my mom or sister then i'm going to deal with. You know."
148.0,Provider,I feel like in a sense if we could take this and look at the silver lining this is preparing you for. For hearing things that you don't always want to hear and and continuing to move forward anyway. I think that's the lesson that you can take from this.
16406.0,Patient,"And you know, once more, I love."
148.0,Provider,You are um let's see what did I. Do.
16406.0,Patient,I will write down next thing all not stop you I know when it comes.
148.0,Provider,"This is preparing you to hear things that you don't want to hear. But you continue to move forward anyway. So this isn't stopping you the next critic won't stop you right, the next time you're rejected it won't stop you. And I think you know another takeaway from this whole situation is that you're unstoppable. you're gonna stop at nothing to achieve your dream. And that's beautiful. that's beautiful."
16406.0,Patient,"want to suffer my daughter's offer see me. Oh, I got a little bit maybe because i'm thinking, I mean this pill, so our doors for children, what time. But still I see that it put me a little bit i'm not so i'm not crying at least i'm not crying. i'm not. Not so emotional."
148.0,Provider,When I hear is that you will stop it.
16406.0,Patient,don't want to stay on maybe change.
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. But what I hear is that you will stop at nothing to achieve your dreams, but you're not willing to lose yourself in the process."
16406.0,Patient,yeah and that's.
148.0,Provider,"Where and that's where you're working really hard right now right you're going to continue moving forward and working towards your dreams and your goals but you're working on yourself to. To make sure that you're healthy right mentally physically spiritually. Throughout because it is a very I mean if we're thinking about the show business like you said it's. it's tough. spot, and you have to have tough skin."
16406.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah. you're not in any i'm not even smoking you're not in any kind of who knows what this woman start taking drinking.
