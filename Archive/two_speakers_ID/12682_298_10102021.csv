298.0,Provider,hi there.
12682.0,Patient,how's it going.
298.0,Provider,"Oh, oh i'm doing well, getting ready for a wedding here at our House in a week so it's a lot of fun. It is my daughters getting married So how have you been feeling how's the medicine working for you."
12682.0,Patient,"it's working well um I mean i've i've kind of gotten to the doses, that I am now I started a little lower. what's working well um I do find myself some days I start my days pretty early. I start working around eight. And I take my meds around like 730 and I do find myself towards the tail end of the day, kind of fading fading out. As a tent I hesitate to take I have before taking a little more just to kind of like. Each through the rest of the day, but then I can't sleep at night i'm just like up online because. The measures. They linger on. So I don't know when."
298.0,Provider,solution when you. When you tried it did you take an extra dose like later or did you take an extra dose in the morning.
12682.0,Patient,"No, I took an extra dose later."
298.0,Provider,"that's where the problem lies. that's that's where i'm that's definitely where the problem lies, because of how many hours it's good for it's activated So if you take a higher dose in the morning let's say 40 milligrams or 50 milligrams it's going to hold you the same 12 hours but it's not going to feel yeah."
12682.0,Patient,So it'll be it'll be just stronger over that over that 12 hour period right.
298.0,Provider,that's correct because you couldn't take one now sometimes what some people do is they will stay at 30 milligrams because 90% of the time it's working for them at the end of the day. And then i'll prescribe a few instant releases for that time when you drop off instead so you would have so it would burn out of your system in four to five hours.
12682.0,Patient,But.
298.0,Provider,"If the instant release, but again you'd probably have to pay out of pocket, whereas if we just went up on the morning dose that would. That could possibly be the answer so that there's not a drop at the end of the day."
12682.0,Patient,yeah I mean whatever works. yeah.
298.0,Provider,"I am more interested in going up. i'm more interested in going up like 10 milligrams and seeing how you feel at the end of the day, and if that doesn't work then adding an instant release."
12682.0,Patient,"difference in. Be. Manufacturers like there's different kinds, when I when I was on the 20 to 25 I was taking a different brand and I feel like it was a little different I get it worked a little different I wrote there they supposed to be exactly the same or the manufacturers, the differences."
298.0,Provider,"You know what I think is that. I think there is a difference that they tried to sell up tell us that there's no difference. I think that's what he's trying, but I hear from my patients all the time that there is a difference, what you're telling me is nothing I haven't heard before and I can't control it, and we have tried to find out which one works better and i'm. Well now, when i'm going to go back to his give you 220s a day in the morning. Okay, so you're going back to a 20 milligrams so maybe. you'll get the brand that you like every time that I try to request a certain brand it becomes the biggest circus to try and find that medicine."
12682.0,Patient,"Really yeah I definitely noticed the difference between the first one that I was taking those ones were the five milligram one, so I know that i've never actually taken a 20 milligram."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, you haven't okay."
12682.0,Patient,"But i've heard that the 20 milligrams or like the there's a certain manufacturer, I did a little bit of research on myself, because I was like there's something different about this, I don't know it was it was up here and then there's a there's a 20 milligram. May bites have a pharmaceuticals and I apparently they're like the original makers."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, and it's tava that I have been trying to find for this patient that I had and it just it's been so air raising to find this MED from the pharmacy and the pharmacist don't want to tell you, who the manufacturer is like there's this big secret is over it, I don't know."
12682.0,Patient,yeah. That would be great.
298.0,Provider,"No, I will put it in the note. That you want this does that mean you'll get it. I don't know it's TV a right. ev a brand. That would be great so I put it in my little note to the pharmacist and we'll see what happens."
12682.0,Patient,"Okay, great i'm actually supposed to pick up some ads today."
298.0,Provider,"You may want to decline picking those up because a new order is coming, or you may want to pick those up because you may need a refill on another refill a prior authorization."
12682.0,Patient,"Okay, so you're sending it over right now."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, sir. Okay, and you'll know about the. prior authorization refuse the old order if this new order is going to go through if you need a prior authorization let bright heart health know that you need that prior authorization for the new that."
12682.0,Patient,"Okay, so if I go pick up the 30s right now i'm not gonna be able to pick up 20."
298.0,Provider,"That is correct, that is correct, if you, you could cancel do you want me to cancel that order right now."
12682.0,Patient,Will if you know how long it might take for me to pick up the 20th.
298.0,Provider,know it could be a week.
12682.0,Patient,"Okay yeah cuz i'm actually I need to go pick up some ads so maybe i'll just go to the pharmacist and right now they're across the street, so I can just go figure out."
298.0,Provider,Any anything else to report. To me about taking this medicine your appetite your moods your.
12682.0,Patient,"Oh, it definitely affects my appetite i'm just so focused on what i'm doing that forget to eat sometimes. yeah. I still eat i'm not like a starving myself or anything like that, but. No, everything is good it's actually it's working really well things are going better with work, but I have a final review for the performance review for the year at the end of November."
