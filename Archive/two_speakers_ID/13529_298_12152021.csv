But a lot of other things like things that I wanted to do like you know, like. i'll have 100 things that I want to do, but I can't do any of them like I have a guitar sitting there that I would love to play.

13529.0,Patient,I know there was any sort of.
298.0,Provider,"yeah there's different ways that you can treat ADHD. Usually first line treatment is start with like something like adderall for adults and if you respond well to adderall then great, then you could move up the ladder that way if. You don't respond well to adderall we can try Ritalin if you still feel like you're like on edge, then we could try something like a blood pressure, medicine, to see if that comes to your body down. I would be open, if you're with me to try and adderall and see how you respond, we could do it at a low dose what's nice about adderall is it puts dopamine in the brain and that can also work. For depression and break depression here's the problem some. People say. It increases their anxiety other people say it's the root of their anxiety. And so we don't know till we try it. And if it doesn't work for you, you let us know and you see me so often that you'll be able to tell me, you know yeah this works this doesn't work."
