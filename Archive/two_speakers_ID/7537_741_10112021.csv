741.0,Provider,"yeah and. So that'll work. it's not a very big group yet. So yeah alright, so I. Was i'm gonna send you an email okay. After our session. And the reason i'm going to do that is because i'm going to send you. This worksheet Can you see this."
7537.0,Patient,yeah I can see it.
741.0,Provider,"Okay um because I want you to go through and work through this worksheet. Because I want to set up start working on getting. strategy together. To create a relapse prevention plan, I want to make sure that because it's somewhere right now you're rocking along and you're doing real good and you're not experiencing any. along the way. is going to happen."
7537.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"we're gonna have to prepare you and have a strategy in place for you. To automatically go into that strategy, when you get triggered so that you don't relapse you understand."
7537.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,um and the only way for us to do.
7537.0,Patient,That is.
741.0,Provider,get a real clear. Of what warning signs are. Okay.
7537.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
741.0,Provider,One of the reasons is that we have really okay relapse is a process okay and.
7537.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"It happens over time. And so, when we actually relax when we actually do the drink or the drug."
7537.0,Patient,We.
741.0,Provider,"are at the end of that process that's a culmination of the process. What happens is that the external pressures from people our attitudes and our thoughts and our old behavior play a role in our relapse Okay, and so. We have to learn what those early warning signs are. So that we can stop them. Basically um it's a. it's a process, usually in our head. Right and one of the things that that. happened to me is that my brain started telling me that because I didn't have a problem with alcohol. You know that wasn't my drug of choice, I never used alcohol. Excuse me. You know I drink socially, but I didn't have to. I didn't have to drink. yeah well what happened, he I convinced myself that I didn't have a problem with alcohol, so I can drink and drink. What happened is I drank so much that I got wasted. And every time I drank I did that. and eventually what happened is I went ended up back at my drug of choice. So. I after a while of drinking, then I ended up well it doesn't matter. I can smoke a little marijuana. And then, after a little while okay. I can do this just once well number one I never did one of anything. So that was the big lie in my head. The other lies and I told myself that I didn't have a problem with alcohol and the otherwise that I told myself was nobody would know. My reality is that if I start using anything people know because I don't know how to be. um so that started that one thought started this whole big snowball. And then, once I took the first dream that was it was. I was already snowball and I ended up back where I was and worse than I was. In no time. we've got to we've got to do something to keep that from happening. So. Like right now I can honestly tell you that the minute that that tape playing in my head, I said oh that's a lie. yeah. And I can tell somebody about it and they can help me confirm and. yeah that's a lie. um So for me when I start hearing that kind of stuff in my head, then I go and talk to somebody a sponsor somebody knows that. I lied to myself. In those areas. So. Are there any like specific things that changed before you began using um Have you ever relaxed before."
7537.0,Patient,"yeah when I first got into the group level on whatever is going to help I did like fine. Okay, but after that and I. didn't I hit me the same I didn't feel like the same side effects that I found before I started taking suboxone. uh huh I just like completely spot it's been like a year since I realized."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, but what was it that you were thinking well for you relax can you remember."
7537.0,Patient,"yeah, I just wanted to buy fill the feeling of taking those again. Later I was getting crazy."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. Alright, so you are experiencing cravings and you want you wanted the. Physical feeling."
7537.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Taking the medication and there's times when that pops up for me to like Okay, I want that. Because I used to get a rush when I did my diet. So. I love that rush well. I have to remind myself that rush puts an overload on my heart."
7537.0,Patient,And he knows really bad things to my body. So.
741.0,Provider,I mean there so there's a lot of things that we think about. Some people use um to. As a reward basically or to celebrate after doing something really hard and we have to change that attitude.
7537.0,Patient,That there are.
741.0,Provider,"other ways to celebrate and other ways to reward ourselves for doing what we're supposed to do. So. And that that's not necessarily a real good way to. Actually that's that's more of a punishment. In reality. But we have to change the way we think about that stuff. And so, our attitudes change and our thinking changes before we ever you. see some of the other things. Well, the other thing, too, is that you know I just liked to be able to check out."
7537.0,Patient,um yeah that's hobby.
741.0,Provider,"And that's I had to learn other methods of checking out. Because, sometimes we have to disconnect from what's going on it's too stressful it's too so meditation, we have to learn other skills that can help us check out. And so, for that reason I just kind of. That that's part of why I want you to go through this I want you to. Think about what. What the process. was before you relapse. What were some thought, what were some of your attitudes I deserve this you know they're there are people who actually believe you know I deserve to be able to do what I want to do wow Okay, maybe, but we have to stop and think about how it affects the people that in our lives to."
7537.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"So that's why i'm i'm I want you to go through this and and work through it and. write down the answers to the questions. And then we can go over i'm probably want to put them in a notebook so that you can hang on to them and not lose them, and so the kid grab them and take off with them. have a tendency to do that."
7537.0,Patient,um yeah.
741.0,Provider,"You know you never know. But you want to hang on to it, so that, once we compile all this information. Because we're going to go through and and do some different exercises, so that we have the information in front of us. Then. We can develop a plan and make sure that we learn the skill. To put the plan into effect. And then you can practice it. And then, when stuff happens, then you have something to fall back on. Does that make sense."
7537.0,Patient,"yeah that makes sense to me. Okay, email it."
741.0,Provider,To me haha.
7537.0,Patient,you'll be emailing it to me right now. yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, great good. All right, well um. Do you have any issues going on, that you want to talk about today."
7537.0,Patient,"um I can't think of any room. On the top of my head. have something i'm in the next meeting. yeah. When that's right, I just want to spend time with my kids before I go to work. Yes, library. i'm working night."
741.0,Provider,"Okay okay. I understand that completely so um. i'm going to stop the sharing and I want to make sure that I have your correct. email hold on just a second sure. I hear him. I had my grant Hello there. How are you. today. This weekend I got to take my granddaughter to church with me. Okay. i'll burn the von. lb are ti V va n m, you are I ll O at gmail.
