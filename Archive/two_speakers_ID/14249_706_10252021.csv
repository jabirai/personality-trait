14249.0,Patient,yeah when I really bad like. Sometimes you know it makes you want to use that.
706.0,Provider,"Because, you said that using gets rid of the voices like it calms them down right like that's always been that's always been the thing they."
14249.0,Patient,Have a. It just makes it more.
706.0,Provider,After.
14249.0,Patient,Our calms it down yeah so.
706.0,Provider,gotcha like. not sure if it really helps. Can you hear me.
14249.0,Patient,yeah I can hear you know.
706.0,Provider,"Right you froze up for just a second. yeah. So you're starting to have some insight into maybe the the heroin didn't really do anything for the voices like it might have calm them for like a minute, but then after it started to wear off it actually made them worse. So yeah so you feel like taking just the regular medications at your prescribed is doing more for you now than when you were self medicating. Right okay so that's some good insight to have and that hopefully will motivate you like, like, I said to keep down this path of recovery because yeah if you can have the right kind of medication regimen to be able to treat. Your mental health issues it's a lot easier to not relapse to not have those slip ups, because you know you feel better. You know, and most people in that situation that are self medicating they're not using because it's fine because they like the euphoria because they're partying. Their self medicating they're trying to use it as a medication to get rid of something that is you know not pleasant like voices or depression or whatever it may be. Someone. can replace That was something that can make those unpleasant things go away, you don't need to have that illicit substance anymore, because you have a medication, that is working. Right, so I feel like that's kind of where you're getting at and so that's really good that's really good that's going to make it that's going to make you so much more successful in your recovery is just following prescribed medications to treat the symptoms."
14249.0,Patient,yeah because.
706.0,Provider,You look better to you don't look as tired and rundown are you sleeping better.
14249.0,Patient,Like really tired right now but.
706.0,Provider,"yeah. Are you sleeping better, though, like at night and more like on a wretch like a schedule, rather than just kind of all over the place. yeah you just you know you. yeah. So. it's not so much that you look like alive like super energetic but you just look more at peace. If that makes sense. You just look car right piece. I know yeah kind of like."
14249.0,Patient,Last night I didn't get a lot of sleep and then right now i'm just like you know just tired. yeah I feel like I smoke some weed or something like. super lazy or something right now it's really yeah.
706.0,Provider,Well there's nothing wrong with. Taking a nap if you need to.
14249.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,You know that can be self care time to just taking a nap or go.
14249.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Or you know, whatever it may be, and self care, time is important, I know we talked about that last time just taking some time for you and kind of shutting out the world and just focusing on kind of just relaxing and rejuvenating."
14249.0,Patient,"Now, should do."
706.0,Provider,"Especially if it's sunny out get out and get some sun because, as the fall months go on, you get less and less sun and then you get less and less of that vitamin D and that can also help moods. helps you bring your mood up when you get vitamin D that's why a lot of times in the winter people get seasonal depression, because you don't get very much sunlight."
14249.0,Patient,crazy.
706.0,Provider,People stay inside because it's cold and snowy and then it's you know overcast you don't get a lot of sun and.
14249.0,Patient,You know.
706.0,Provider,"So sometimes it helps to take like a vitamin D supplement in the winter, if you are one of those people that falls into that category. All right, well, I will go ahead and let you go we'll just do a short session today, it sounds like you're doing wow sounds like everything's going, you know, in a better direction you're feeling better. You know, since we were both late today we'll just cut it short but. Hopefully, when I see you here in another couple weeks, things are still moving in that right direction."
14249.0,Patient,"yeah they should be, I hope so, definitely."
