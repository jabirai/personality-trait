226.0,Provider,Eric upside to kind of.
11897.0,Patient,"Oh, we see I don't know that."
226.0,Provider,sideways. yeah.
11897.0,Patient,That should be.
226.0,Provider,"yeah okay good. All right, hey I haven't seen you in a while."
11897.0,Patient,I know it's been too long.
226.0,Provider,How are you doing.
11897.0,Patient,"i'm doing okay just didn't work in school, and all that stuff."
226.0,Provider,yeah so when did when did all that start back up again couple weeks ago right.
11897.0,Patient,August 23.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, almost a month okay. fulfillment me, let me know it's been going on."
11897.0,Patient,"i've been doing the new group. therapy on zoo on Tuesdays at 11 after my class. yeah um it's good um sometimes it's a little bigger, so it does it feels intimate but it's still you know nice to hear everybody's. input and relate. So that's good i've been working and do school work. yeah I don't really know what's left it."
226.0,Provider,sounds kind of narrow doesn't sound like there's a lot going on in your life sounds like it's kind of blah my right.
11897.0,Patient,yeah yeah you know other than being busy with school work when there's every i'm just still kind of there. So taking my medications. Oh sorry.
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so do you feel like the medications that have helped you at."
11897.0,Patient,All. I don't know I want to see maybe.
226.0,Provider,"So um okay so that's kind of an interesting answer, because I feel like he would know Sydney like you know, like when you came into the program like their suppression right there's like depression on, and so, and we have how much do you feel like your depression has improved."
11897.0,Patient,"I feel like since working school started I don't because before I would just sit at home. And my thing. Now that I. You know, go to school in the morning and then I go to work after I come home and have homework to do and I go to bed, I feel like it's a distraction so. I don't I still do feel depressed it it moments. and anxious a lot. yeah, but I still feel like I don't really have a solid answer about the medication submit the one medication the lexapro."
226.0,Provider,"And because really with depression, you would notice a difference so even when you're on the. Even when you are on the medication and you weren't in school and they weren't working you weren't able to really use coping skills you weren't able to really make some changes that would be helpful for you like stuff we talked about or. You know stuff that you heard in group, and it was just like you are in your room and you weren't doing anything and so. i'm just I want to explore that a little bit with the because. A distraction, the way you describe school and work as a distraction doesn't equate to happiness that equates to a distraction that's really not taking care of the depression or the anxiety so. What do you think's going on, like what do you, what do you feel could be different in your life or maybe you're okay just where it is right now."
11897.0,Patient,i'm. guessing mutual where it is right now. angels getting rid of the anxiety that I feel a lot I just since I was a little everything is means it I get nervous. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's kind of not an answer you know what i'm saying like. yeah just wanted to know like how much you're really like exploring this you know, like instead of like letting this just sort of be a part of who you are. Like my my question. Is that there hasn't been it doesn't feel like there's been any self reflect natural like what's the amount of self reflection that you've been able to use on this like. I mean it's so I guess there's two things here so there's two ways to go like you can be really like you might just be okay with how you are. And not really want to make any changes I know the anxiety is a little bit troublesome but. I mean, maybe this is okay i'm just asking you know to feel like being neutral about stuff you know not really knowing if the medication is working, I mean it's not right or wrong, you know it's just like maybe this is this Okay, for you Is this how you're happy."
11897.0,Patient,"No actually know that makes more sense um I would, I would like to feel more like when I when i'm not doing anything I still feel kind of like slumped um I am trying to be more social at my new university so i'm trying to get into a sorority. So I didn't join event last Saturday and it's just kind of like you meet the people and. it's like a series of events i'm hoping they contact me again to go to another one, because I really, really, really want to be in so i'm. leaning on that okay."
226.0,Provider,It was oh yeah.
11897.0,Patient,"Now I went all alone, with no usually I bring someone with me and I was like just going to do it and it. Was fun, it was good, we painted and talk to each other and. So yeah i'm trying to be more social."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11897.0,Patient,"And not Okay, thank you, thank you."
226.0,Provider,Okay okay that's good like that's a big thing like when I say hey fill me in like that the big bang like that's a good fun thing so tell me where you're going to school again what university.
11897.0,Patient,Oh cal state fullerton in orange county or something like that yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so. rush, are they have a started rush or was it just like introduction."
11897.0,Patient,"I believe they seem overly too familiar with the terms I think it's rush they're calling it continuous open bidding, so I think they've already picked their formal the formal another doing the informal to bring more people in. gotcha i'm doing the informal."
226.0,Provider,Okay okay good So do you just wait for them to contact you.
11897.0,Patient,"yeah yeah the girl said on Saturday, she would reach out to everybody, I don't want to be pushy, but I want to message her and asked her but i'll just wait a little bit more."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so did you go to different houses or just one house or two houses or what."
11897.0,Patient,"um I went to one House a when we had our clubs all lined out outside of our school I signed it, for three sororities and only one of them got back to me, which was the one that I went to, and I really liked that one, so I would like to keep exploring that one."
226.0,Provider,Okay what's the name of it.
11897.0,Patient,zeta TAO alpha.
226.0,Provider,"Okay yeah okay all right great good step really nice. Alright, so that's good and. So did you feel more connected when you were at that event."
11897.0,Patient,yeah I want to be a part of something.
226.0,Provider,yeah right.
11897.0,Patient,"um so yeah I just always be involved with people and go to events or just hanging out do studying because they're all a part of a house, so I just I don't know I felt like I would like to keep connecting with them and meeting more of them, so I. would hope they contact me again."
226.0,Provider,Okay So what about. clubs or organizations that school Have you considered doing that.
11897.0,Patient,"um yes there's one that's called like the adventure club, where they like plan meetings to go Heikki or think it's like outdoor stuff so i'm looking into that one too yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Okay perfect that's that's good so that's a great way to get. Obviously, to get connected with other people. I sequence, I think I think you know just with covert and everything that's was really missing. You know, and I think that that contributes to the depression. So when you lack of human contact is. going to create depression so doing anything like that that gets you out and about is going to be. Really really helpful really important to do like trying to get back, are you doing in class learning."
11897.0,Patient,I have to online and then to enforce.
226.0,Provider,"All right, how's the in person going."
11897.0,Patient,"I like it, I love being on campus it's great I wish I had more time, but I have to go to work after which is okay i'll have time in the future man. yeah man, I really like it."
226.0,Provider,Okay cool okay so tell me how is work on.
11897.0,Patient,"Work is OK, it is a little stressful to the after school Program. And right now, before the pandemic, we had a lot more kids and it's our program is like in competition with a free one, at the same schools, so not many parents are joining ours and it's understandable but. Just even being with a few amount of kids sometimes is very draining. Because i'm already so tired from waking up early and you know doing my homework and and having I love the kids, but I just find it extra draining this time I don't know why. I have so much energy."
226.0,Provider,My God. i'm do like the classes that you're taking.
11897.0,Patient,"I do, I have to take three general ED unfortunately and then i'm taking one of my major courses. there's no further all. really good I can't complain."
226.0,Provider,Okay um okay so tell me like what would be helpful to go over today and what would be good for you to talk about this.
11897.0,Patient,"I guess just understanding more of like how, how can I like to know if my medication is working or not I don't know why I still feel like maybe i'm just paranoid, and I don't know."
226.0,Provider,Okay here in lexapro. How long have you been on the lexapro.
11897.0,Patient,"Since July I started off on five milligrams and then 10 and now among 20 I recently started like two weeks ago on the 20 something like that, I think."
226.0,Provider,Have you talked to have you had an appointment with shontelle recently.
11897.0,Patient,"yeah I had. a winning team. I mentioned the same thing that I want to continue to try it because I know, maybe it's just taking a little longer for me, I just want to give it a fair chance, but then I don't know how long i'm supposed to try it until I know okay let's train other ones."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so see that's the thing it's like you have to let shontelle know like okay i'm stopped feeling much different i'm still really glad I feel blah."
11897.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"You know, like do you have lack of motivation."
11897.0,Patient,"um. I remember, I used to have it a lot more now it just I guess depends. I don't even have a straight answer for that either."
226.0,Provider,"So here's what I want you to focus on. Okay, this is going to be really helpful for us to me and I want you to really try and do this because. I want you to I want you to. So. When I when I ask a question like Okay, how do you feel What about this, but I like like your answer, sometimes or like you don't know so I want you to get to a place where you really do now like, I want you to work on getting to a place where you can say to me. yeah you know, like i'm still feeling depressed, this is why. You know i've been monitored or monitoring being on the lexapro for the last two weeks and i've noticed there's not been any change. or I started I started on looks pro in July, and now this is September and i've noticed that I feel a little bit better or I feel a lot better so being able to identify you. Being able to identify how you're really feeling Okay, so we are, we know that you have anxiety and you know you have anxiety that's clear, I think that what for you, where it gets really murky is around the depression. OK, so the depression is really what keeps its hold it hold you back from I mean like are you happy it's my next question are you happy."
11897.0,Patient,I guess with myself not 100%.
226.0,Provider,Okay.
11897.0,Patient,"My living situation family, you know, we have our arguments, but i'm i'm happy with that sometimes we I myself no not not yet."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Okay, so that would be something that I want you to explore like explore like okay Why am I not happy with myself like what do I need to do. To. Create happiness in my life. Do you have any idea what that would be."
11897.0,Patient,"um. I think, maybe. being more active, even if it's just walking I don't like running. Maybe I would get there one day. being more social i'm trying to be more. Social classmates. I asked someone to meet up with me Fridays, we could study together and. Nice good. Great just stepping out of my comfort zone, little by little."
226.0,Provider,"I agree that's great okay that's perfect that's that's insightful That means that you you're in touch with what you need. What you know you need to do to create these changes and that's where I really want you to focus. Is I want you to focus on these areas, and so I think it's awesome what you're doing to step out of your comfort zone, socially and. I like the part of being more active you don't have to run a marathon okay being more active can just be walking around the block every day but getting outside getting fresh air getting sunshine moving your body. joining a club. You know that high da club or you know, continuing to keep your eye open for like things that sounds interesting really fun to do so. This is going to be really important because Member that, like the medication only works as to you know it works, but only you have to do the rest of the work so. The medication is really designed to kind of get you over that hump where you can feel you know good enough to like get out and. make changes, yes, and you know feel confident in you know socializing and all of that stuff so the medications been a work like you know, maybe 30 40%."
11897.0,Patient,"yeah and I wonder. Maybe a little bit has helped me except I feel like back. In the day before I started bright heart health I would never have gone to a sorority house alone. yeah and. So maybe it might be a little bit. But yeah I will be doing more searching for that, so I can know better than the switcher."
226.0,Provider,"Well, and I just want you to try and like connect with yourself a little bit more, do you know what I mean by that when I say connect with yourself."
11897.0,Patient,I don't think i'm 100% sure.
226.0,Provider,"So connect with yourself means, like you, like really like ask yourself what color do I, like it or don't what do I like to do what don't I like to do like what kind of person do I. Have what kind of people do I like to be around like what kind of activities do I like to do, who am I, like asking yourself like who am I, you know okay well i'm a student I were. I have a family, you know there's more to yourself than just that, like who am I, like what makes me."
11897.0,Patient,Question yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you don't know that I want you to start writing down like that's your your homework until the next time we meet as I want you to really start, I want you to write down like who you are what makes you you what you love about yourself areas of where of improvement, like just. I want you to start spending time getting to know yourself, not as how you think other Co not as how you think you want to be seen, but how like exactly like who you are okay."
11897.0,Patient,So.
226.0,Provider,"let's let's start there and and you know let's let's like see what you come up with okay. So wait remind me, are you seen an outside therapist to. Yes, that's right, what are you guys working on just general general anybody working on."
11897.0,Patient,"Well gosh it's always kind of random I would think I would usually it's family family issues relations relationship issues my security insecurities and is it blood whatever at that moment, or that week. yeah i'll write it down, and then we talked to her, so it kind of changes but it's always usually like similar topic."
226.0,Provider,And how often do you meet with her.
11897.0,Patient,"It used to be every week, but then, since my schedule change with work and school it's every other Friday."
226.0,Provider,"So do you want to meet with me, we can just do once a month would that be helpful for you."
11897.0,Patient,"yeah when I was at the care navigation, or they told me, I had to meet twice a month, which is also perfectly fine with me but it's everything works."
226.0,Provider,"yeah but, so the thing is anybody that's do you have a release of information on file for me just to call your therapist and confirm that you're meeting with her."
11897.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah I signed out with her and then here as well, for bret Hart."
226.0,Provider,"OK cool so as long as we have that, then I mean concert is such a thing as too much there be. You know anybody that has an outside therapist. Let me write this really fast, right now, so I don't Okay, so you don't have to anyone that has an outside therapist. doesn't have to meet as often hold on a second."
