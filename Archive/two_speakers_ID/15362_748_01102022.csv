15362.0,Patient,Hello.
748.0,Provider,"hello, how are you."
15362.0,Patient,i'm good.
748.0,Provider,So i'm glad you're here.
15362.0,Patient,"Okay, go ahead, repeating."
748.0,Provider,What.
15362.0,Patient,Go ahead repeat that I just connected my head.
748.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, and I said i'm glad you're."
15362.0,Patient,"Oh, thank you i'm glad i'm here too."
748.0,Provider,"So in our last session, you mentioned that you wanted to talk about the an experience you had with your last therapist."
15362.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm. Actually, before we get into that i'm so sorry for missing last session will come a bit later than expected, because I have told."
748.0,Provider,"You you. You know I wondered and I actually woke up with. symptoms yesterday and they've gotten progressively worse and i'm going to get tested so. I want you know I wasn't sure no problem about missing I wasn't sure if it was that or if you're confused because you've got scheduled so quickly, then it seemed. unusual to me how. Soon after the previous session has been scheduled so."
15362.0,Patient,I know I thought it was a little weird to.
748.0,Provider,"yeah. So I didn't know if perhaps it. Just threw you off and you would not know that can't be right, anyway, either way i'm glad you're here today, how are you feeling now."
15362.0,Patient,um it's actually the best it's been. A while i've had it for a little over a week now and currently a cough and not mildly sore throat.
748.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad you're feeling better I know in group, you were talking about that could be the case that you were all getting tested and your symptoms didn't seem as pronounced, as they are now but they've probably got progressively stronger."
15362.0,Patient,"On Wednesday, my dad got tested and he came out positive. Everybody in my family currently has coated. yeah um I got an appointment for this past Saturday. which I did, and I got a positive result, but then again i've been sick for like over a week now."
748.0,Provider,way exactly.
15362.0,Patient,saying I.
748.0,Provider,want it sounds as though you're taking good care of yourself through it.
15362.0,Patient,it's been interesting.
748.0,Provider,Has it.
15362.0,Patient,You know I mean I wasn't expecting i'm catching colds it but. It wasn't as bad as I thought then again I am double vaccinated.
748.0,Provider,"This variant is apparently just a lot more contagious but also a lot milder. yeah it's really. yeah it's really quite. Severe cold but. Nonetheless, yeah. or even a flu. it's fairly reflective from what i'm reading and also just thinking through that the whole concept of a virus which. Is when it's new it's huge and impact so severely and then, as the variance. mutate they become less severe and and the culture becomes more able to withstand it. gets guessing that's what we'll continue to see moving forward."
15362.0,Patient,Here yeah.
748.0,Provider,Well i'm glad you're here we don't have to do a full hour. So that you're able to go back and rest. If that's what you need.
15362.0,Patient,i'm fine.
748.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15362.0,Patient,"um so with the last therapist. The issue, I had was that they came across as a bit. cold and distant and they have a. tendency to jump in. and not necessarily like finish my thoughts, but. jump in when I wasn't finished with my thought. and I mean i've been with a lot of therapists that is the first time i've ever had to deal with that. I don't know it just didn't really jive with me so on the second oh I should look elsewhere. And I made sure it wasn't just a first appointment thing I actually attended a few. Now this isn't working."
748.0,Provider,Okay. Well i'm really glad that you took care of yourself. And that you were able to acknowledge it wasn't you. know and ensure that you got seen and. and supported for who you are and what.
15362.0,Patient,"The most important thing was to make sure that the therapist was, I mean this has always been a thing, just to make sure the therapist is chill with trans people and from there. We figure out be you know the personality, or whatever. And so far i've been i've had a pretty good track record all the therapists i've been with Ben good they've had their own way of going about things and they've all worked. When. I guess when I need to. My first therapist was a lot more hands on understandable because you know I am I was younger and it was a bit more scary and my last therapist was a lot more hands off i've relaxed, it was like talking with a friend. and yeah it was helpful okay."
748.0,Provider,And what is it that you like to experience when you're in counseling or therapy.
15362.0,Patient,"Not 100% sure, but it is nice to. Talk to somebody and get. I don't know. Confirmation or I don't know advice. In a way, that. I guess it isn't like a doctor. You know, and I mean I guess it's more personable."
748.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah. But also supportive. And yeah yeah and yet has a different flavor than hanging out with the French. Okay. Well, I appreciate the feedback or the the. Clarity that you have around what your last experience with one."
15362.0,Patient,and
748.0,Provider,How did you finally resolved that. Less.
15362.0,Patient,"During the last deployment, I mean. We had. started planning to do stuff like this go discuss stuff and. You know, we added to the appointment and i'm just like yeah this isn't for me, so I immediately went to the care navigator and he. changed the therapist."
748.0,Provider,Okay.
15362.0,Patient,"uh huh and I. gave them my complaint. and I had already in the past, given them a complaint, because the therapist had no showed to one of the appointments. and You know, in times previously, this is before I even saw the therapist for the first place. They kept rescheduling on me, because they kept having like a power outage in their area. After three rescheduling so I found that hard to believe."
748.0,Provider,"You know I. That does seem hard to believe, but then again we're in an area we're in areas that are a lot more. user friendly for for that kind of thing I mean it's hard to say it's hard to say, but I can certainly understand that."
15362.0,Patient,there.
748.0,Provider,"Certainly. i'm really glad you took care of yourself. Now you're able to move forward, how are you feeling about it now."
15362.0,Patient,"Previous. I mean it's just. A bump in the road. I mean. therapists and work hard you just change it, if you can. And I mean I really have hard feelings about it. it's been a while, too, so you know it just kind of just fades. wasn't like a damaging experience anything, it was just kind of like disappointing."
748.0,Provider,"That makes a lot of sense a. lot of sense. And i'm i'm very glad that you brought it up and share that. And I hope that you'll be forthcoming, if there are issues that arise between us during the sessions, that we have, if there are times that you don't feel heard or feel as though something that's really important to us being addressed as. We, as you need it to be."
15362.0,Patient,yeah. I definitely like you.
748.0,Provider,"Well, good i'm glad I appreciate that and I hope that i'm you know, I was a little concerned this morning about because it's important to me to be present, and when you're not feeling well it's harder to be oppressive So if you notice that today, please definitely call it out. If you bring other things today that you'd like to address we'll talk about."
15362.0,Patient,i'm. i'll be honest what's been on my mind this whole time I spent.
748.0,Provider,i'm sure.
15362.0,Patient,"Let me see. Oh yeah i'm. nice things. That came into your life. No good things can come into your life. My notes from last time. um. Well, I need a cold it's not a new good thing but. I guess, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that. I wasn't going to be like bed bound or hospital."
748.0,Provider,Absolutely.
15362.0,Patient,And I was able to work through it better than I expected.
748.0,Provider,Emotionally is that it to me.
15362.0,Patient,"Emotionally it's been. I mean, I know it's not like a moral failing to have colby but it. kind of feels bad because you know I finally caught it and. not been trying, you know not to capture for summer arm, but again, it was just out of my control, you know."
748.0,Provider,Is there a sense of where it was where it came from it sounds like it was likely your dad is that accurate.
15362.0,Patient,Most likely my dad.
748.0,Provider,For more.
15362.0,Patient,cuz he was the first to exhibit symptoms exhibit the. day before everybody else. My entire family has it so yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Well, with one person in the House getting it it's so the end this strain is even more so it's so contagious. And being in the same House So how could you not especially when you didn't know. yeah yeah and and am I remembering accurately that your dad probably caught it at work."
15362.0,Patient,i'm most likely yeah. Because it was working leading up to new years so it's conceivable he hadn't even longer. Because he exhibited symptoms on new year's day. So yeah it's been a while now. yeah.
748.0,Provider,How is he feeling.
15362.0,Patient,"pretty much like. I guess done with it, you know I think he. yeah it's like a lingering dry cough and that's it."
748.0,Provider,and have that others.
15362.0,Patient,"My mom and I are basically my mom is a day behind in the symptoms, because we all exhibiting the exact same symptoms. So my mom is about a day behind my dad and i'm a day behind my mom in terms of symptoms okay my sister is. my sister is interesting because she didn't exhibit symptoms until a few days ago. So she's probably like a week behind my bad. But I mean it just peaks it gets. rough it's not feverish that's the weird thing I never got a fever, but. You just feel really sick and just kind of. fades. there's a bit of up and down, but overall just kind of fades. it's mostly concentrated like in your throat your nose, maybe some sinus pressure now."
748.0,Provider,I can certainly hear it.
15362.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
748.0,Provider,yeah and it sounds as though the whole House is just been sort of very low energy. All of you.
15362.0,Patient,"might actually want to work. I think you went to work today. After a certain double check, but if you did go to work today, I mean he's at the end of his. quarantine period so. um I think my mom oh hi. I think my mom also is pretty much at the end of her according to predict that it's 10 days. So she'll be going to work. On I don't work so it's kind of a moot point and i'm always hard to oh hi. This is one of my coping mechanisms."
748.0,Provider,Nice.
15362.0,Patient,um. my sister has work but. I believe she actually has like a long weekend so that's working out for her. Just to have reduced hours because she's currently taking online classes for college.
748.0,Provider,Well he's still quarantine for sure if she got it later.
15362.0,Patient,And she's doing her homework.
748.0,Provider,So you're all kind of taking care of yourselves and be. walking through it together.
15362.0,Patient,yeah. yeah we installed that yesterday.
748.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15362.0,Patient,it's my progress pride like.
748.0,Provider,That is really cool.
15362.0,Patient,"yeah i've been wanting to put that thing up for. Six months now, but we finally. got the idea of putting it above the the TV and the Bolton board rather than on the other, wall, because the structure was looking busy we couldn't figure out where, to put it. i've always wanted one of us."
748.0,Provider,Like very good spot. Wonderful.
15362.0,Patient,"It was. was a special thing that had for. Pride month, so that we're solving that flag. Yes, and."
748.0,Provider,I know that. came out and the number of people that it was in yards and yeah really.
15362.0,Patient,yeah I like that.
748.0,Provider,that's great. i'm glad it feels good to you.
15362.0,Patient,"yeah i'm fortunate that you know my family is supportive and. I mean yeah basically i'm just thankful that my family support Oh, you know it's been as smooth as it can possibly be with all of that."
748.0,Provider,i'd love to hear a bit about your experience about your journey. Because it seems as though that's a fairly major piece of your process and and story.
15362.0,Patient,"yeah it's um. it's interesting because I don't exactly know. When it began. That journey is. tied in with. My. Depression and no no way that I. don't know which began first my uncertainty regarding all that or my. Being you know the playoffs. I guess was depression started sooner, but it was a bit different. Because those family stuff that wasn't my personal depression, but."
748.0,Provider,Can you say more about that.
15362.0,Patient,about what.
748.0,Provider,About you said it was family stuff.
15362.0,Patient,um well in 2010. We suspected my dad of cheating and.
748.0,Provider,"The threat of or the potential for I shouldn't say threat, the potential for the divorce that's right that's right. yeah that's that's my brain I apologize just feeling a little under the weather and not remembering. correctly. I think it's just the context was an APP anyway, no need to excuse it it just is what it is yes, so that was a trigger I one year ago, it may be in your subconscious there wasn't some connection to and what's going on with me."
15362.0,Patient,"I guess yeah. made it was um. I mean at the time it was. difficult to process because I wasn't sure where. I could, I guess, we were all the ending up. markets where I would be ending up. and I don't know I mean. i've always had and before all of this, like since elementary school i've always had. It in inward. Looking personality, I guess. I was always kind of thoughtful and. Taking about things. deeply I guess. Before I. Left elementary school and I knew it was my last year, and you know, obviously. I was aware of the. Temporary miss of that experience, so I ensure that I know. Right I saved it and I enjoyed it at the time and. i'm. You know I reflected on the past experiences I had at my elementary school before I left it. and I don't know I just kind of always been that way. The year after I left elementary school that's when that whole situation happened. and So I believe that. You know. With that shock, I may have looked more inward. to figure out where I am at on things and. I want to say i've been depressed since. On diagnosed, because if I you know think back on those times. I can definitely see how it would manifest at that time I was a bit more quiet a bit more reflective. More so than in the past. I wanted to be more alone. Though that's kind of hard to figure out if that's just like my personality, or if it's the depression. and The desire to. I don't know a desire to rethink. How i'm moving forward in life at that time I was in middle school, which was a great time. very unusual. yeah very unusually. um. I mean elementary school elementary school I didn't really have anything like bad to say about it just you know it wasn't right experience. middle school was fantastic. I don't think I had an equivalent experience until maybe junior or senior year of high school. But. My second year of middle school, which was 2011 2010 2011. Was fantastic because of the friends that I made. And some of the experiences that I had. that's when a lot of my current interests. kind of took hold and. I had a friend group composed almost entirely of girls matter, for I think it was entirely referrals. I was the only guy. wink. um. and"
748.0,Provider,"You didn't have that inclination or awareness, yet. If it hadn't crossed your mind in that context. And i'm. an artist that was cultural."
15362.0,Patient,"And I became more active with whatever was going on in the world. The tsunami, when the tsunami hit Japan or like a fundraiser at my school and i'll part of be little. bored That said, you know, we should help Japan, and you know. collected donations, so they get sent to Japan to help the recovery effort. and I don't know we just had. A great time and there was a nice. Balance to what was going on at home at the time was a lot of uncertainty. That a fair scare I guess was. still fresh at the time. My mom's physical and mental health was. um I would say approaching its lowest point. And she was a lot more unavailable about literally. So. That was definitely a contributing factor to my sense of disconnect from her. So I relationship deteriorated somewhat. Because. I was used to her, you know being there and being more available and, as things kind of progressed what whatever what's going on with you know. You know, adult stuff. Yet. manifested in. That. more distant relationship and also. My mom had a tendency to project. Some of her frustrations. onto us. Like yelling at us, or whatever you know. Because. I mean, I guess she just didn't have good coping mechanisms at the time. um. But. Despite all of that, you know I still felt loved and I guess that's why it hurts so much too, because you feel love, but also this happens so it's just like. Okay, how do I process this you know. So. By virtue of the fact that I guess my dad was not really sure, because he was at work and, at the time he worked from noon until 1030. it's up on the weekends. I started developing a closer relationship with my dad than I do, with my mom at that time because of what was going on, but my mom struggling with you know. Having been betrayed. Or at least the suspicion that we have been betrayed yes. um. I was pretty young when all this was going down, so I don't know what was going through her head, but I know that she was. still struggling with it in her own way."
748.0,Provider,"Have you talked about it, since then."
15362.0,Patient,"I think, maybe once I don't know long time ago, but. I don't know we haven't really like talk recently about it."
748.0,Provider,just wondering if you to process your. Experience within the family at all. As we have. Okay okay.
15362.0,Patient,"Last year, we had a scare again. Because. My dad. had an instagram account and my dad is stupid doesn't know how to work and instagram account so one some pretty pictures came up. of some ladies. He harder that without realizing that when you do that it's just going to show you more of that shit. and yeah eventually his timeline I guess became full of that stuff. The site, no, no you're supposed to ignore that. and It was using instagram I guess to share like truck pictures with a truck club you was in way back in the day it was like submitted get to them for their archive okay. And what we caught wind of. The instagram account and whatever what's going on the likes of all these pictures. i'm. At that time it was about it was this past June and. We thought for real it was over, that the relationship okay this isn't salvageable at this point. You know I mean, because now we got like like proof proof that this is some sort of cheating. And we were reassured that this was. A mistake and misunderstanding. um and. My parents talked about it a lot and. I was kind of in the middle of it because I had to figure out how to. Oh, and I had to figure out if. My what my dad was saying was a truth. um. Because he said that when he tried to unfollow all these people that I guess the X men will follow, and they would just report back into his final list. And although that's unusual I tried it and it turns out yeah That is exactly but. Whenever I don't follow all of these people, it would automatically pop back up as if I never unfollow them too slick, I have never seen this in my life, but using instagram. Thank your account is fucked. We believe you. will need to get rid of this account. At that point my dad was success once sending all the pictures you wanted to to the people, so he was already considered getting rid of the account um. So we were able to shut down the account, and although it kind of messed us up with it. We were able to. overcome that. and Although the situation was never. There wasn't foreclosure around it, because. My parents were struggling to find a therapist. At least at the time I don't know if they're actively searching around it. But, at the time that was. A reminder of. Past situations that had happened. There have been some scares like that in the past. Because of my mom's distrust. or misunderstanding something or I that doing something stupid. and I guess that is a contributing factor to. Be lingering those lingering thoughts. Because it's debatable whether it ever truly ended. and Is and is one of many factors put a reason that my sister, and I want to leave and live our in our own space, because we don't want to be continuously reminded and subjected to all of that trauma I guess."
748.0,Provider,Your online right.
15362.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,"As it does feel as though there's so much. tie tie between within the family that there's there must be some challenge, it seems that would seem there's a challenge in your independence and your ability to build your life, separate from the. objective being just connecting from. Completely but. Separating enough to build your independence."
15362.0,Patient,"I am. My family is very. I guess a good way of putting it is connected. My. my grandparents on my dad's side is dead. grandpa my mom scientist and my grandma on my mom's side is the only living grandparent. And she's lovely. I think she loves me Martin she loves her own daughter. she's also accepting the fact that i'm trans, which is good. um. And my mom has a younger brother and a younger sister that is distant. And my dad has a younger sister and a younger brother younger sister is distant and the younger brother it's a. long story to that."
748.0,Provider,I was going to say what does that actually mean what way.
15362.0,Patient,"i'm just kind of like a bully. Okay, thanks he's hot shit. You know that kind of a person. um. And I mean i'm the eldest of my family with my younger sister. and"
748.0,Provider,And where are you in relation to cousins in terms that that oldest to youngest middle.
15362.0,Patient,"I am the oldest of my generation i'm the oldest of all my cousins However, I have zero relationship with my cousins because i'm. On my mom's side. My mom is only one that has kids so there's no cousins to speak of. There is one. Actually, no two kids but it's my mom's brother and it's through a marriage and it's her kids not."
748.0,Provider,His kids I see.
15362.0,Patient,"So I don't know if that really counts, like a half cousin. Right um."
748.0,Provider,Though you've developed developed or cultivated relationship there so. No one.
15362.0,Patient,"of my cousins I could have cultivated a relationship with my. My dad's brother's kids but because my dad's brother is a Dick I have no interest in cultivating really them, but they will be the closest in age to me they were born like five years after me okay. i'm sure they're lovely. um I don't know if they know I exist. I don't know anything about them other than the fact that they go to a you know, a certain school because it's the only school in the area and. You know their age. But Besides that, I don't really know anything about them. So in the Grand scheme of things. we're a pretty small family unit it's basically just the four of us and grandma."
748.0,Provider,"So interesting to hear because I hear how tightly connected all of you are. And then, how much distance there is. outside of you. In the rest of the family are any of those people connected to other members of the family, like the brother and sister or."
15362.0,Patient,I mean everybody is connected through my parents um.
748.0,Provider,But I mean are. Are your father's siblings more connected to each other than your father is to them.
15362.0,Patient,"No they're not even that connect to each other. they're just kind of altering their own directions. um. They all kind of developed and really unique ways, because there was so much going on with my dad's upbringing, you know with my grandparents. And there was a lot going on with my grandparents my mom's side as well, so every kid had a very different experience. And the age difference isn't that big, but it is. Notable."
748.0,Provider,Especially when you're a little kids it's.
15362.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"it's very no default and then it that that significant disparity dissipates as time goes on, and age becomes less of a factor I guess is one way to. saying you know if you're 20 if you're four and and three months it's a big deal if you're 10 and six it's a big deal if you're 16 and 12 it's a pretty big deal. Significant deal if you're 25 and 21 it's different it gets your start getting closer and then the longer you go on it's know, by the time you're 64 elephant. Sam in 56 doesn't matter much. So yeah I can well imagine how much that's played into things for all of you absolutely."
15362.0,Patient,"In the past we've had. We had um. we're beyond that my mom's. My grandma sister I only have one grandma so i'm my grandma's sister lives in San Diego. and Be and have the extended family, they are the only extended family, we have a somewhat close relationship to. um. I learned that her husband used to be addict but there's actually just chill. um he used to be like."
748.0,Provider,How did that come about.
15362.0,Patient,um he got burned too many times. While being a Dick.
748.0,Provider,Okay.
15362.0,Patient,"So, and he mellowed himself time. I didn't know that was a thing i've only known him it's just like. Well he's technically a great uncle once removed or something like that, but I don't know he's just always been. himself to me just chill. silly. But he used to be very vindictive person way back in the day, so my parents have a different relationship with him than I do. But that their kids which are like much older than me. I think they're like 12 years older than me. Where the closest thing I had to a cousin. Okay um. And they were child, you know we chat and stuff like that and. they're all. doing whatever living their lives in San Diego now but. When I was younger and I would visit them. It was. It was nice I guess. That would be. The extent of my extended family that I have a personal relationship with everybody else is very, very distant or. Is unapproachable due to their. Maybe they're like an asshole or something. order. So. We are very I guess the way my mom put it is just like we're a small family and we're here. Which is, which is interesting, because then Hispanic families it's usually huge, but our Hispanic families very tight knit and small and. I don't know we just kind of lean on each other and stuff like that and. And yeah I mean that's. I don't know if that's a large part of why we all love each other, the way we do, but it does play a factor into the fact that. You know, we. I don't know I don't know how to put it. Well, I don't want to hurt each other."
748.0,Provider,What yeah. And there's a lot of support for each other. And a real commitment to work through things. yeah. yeah and and also the. Other thing that stands out is they're all very supportive of you.
15362.0,Patient,"wasn't guaranteed. Exactly but i'm glad it worked out, it was. It took effort i'm. Especially on my mom would my mom. But. It worked out in the end. The only people in my family that I haven't come out to that are relevant, is that. Great aunt and uncle and San Diego. We haven't been down literally haven't visited them since before I came out as trans we went there for Christmas the Christmas before I realized phelps trance. Of the last time we ever went down there and. We haven't been back since. And they don't know i'm trans but. I don't know I don't think it would go well, but then again they're not the closest family, so I guess, we would just have to see how that goes if we end this thing."
748.0,Provider,"Well, I appreciate all the bathroom today, it sets up a good. structure for me to understand more about who you are and and what impacts family life has had on and so forth, as we move forward in our work together. There anything that you'd like to set as an intention for. Now our next session or. goal."
15362.0,Patient,"um. i'm not sure I guess, I want to. I guess during our session on this like oh yeah i'm going to do all this stuff i'm going to be like so motivated and then I immediately get cold.
