I worked there once before, so we're actually twice that's out there in 2018 but I only worked for like. Three months and I got kicked out as clean and sober house and I was in and but can I went back to the streets, and then I only lashes working staying on the streets, but like two more contact doesn't that sober house for one month, you know, and I got my job as a. fucking so I just went back to the street. I got strung out and she said that she didn't last very long and what happened is I went to jail, but when I was in jail, I wrote my boss, and let her know that I wanted to come back and whatever whatever enough. And the secretary wrote me back. And she said yes, thank you, I went back to work, and whatever you know, but what happened is when I got out I waited two weeks, instead of going right back in to get my job back when I got out. I waited two weeks and I got all strung out again shaking I mean I started using. heroin hell, and then I waited two weeks after I got out using this shit to go back down there and try to get my job back. And I got back in but I was only there for like three days and I looked into the office, but it was a complete different side, like, I was over, where. Where they do picking and all that, where they planted and shit like that you know I mean I wasn't in their grade nine I didn't like what I did I had to clean pipes and shane is about the shot, so I just took off."
724.0,Provider,And then they took it back for a third time that's where you're at currently.
6189.0,Patient,"yeah third time you especially easy to get in there right because, like I filled out an application shit my God worked on a few times, so I went down there. And there was another hiring boss, though right, I talked to him and he told me all the shit to do right he's like fill out an application and. Work on getting my first certificate so so you can use that fucking to work right, so I went down there I do that, and then I went back down there to let them know. That i'm working on it and how long it takes to get my first update and shit like that, and he told me that there was no work if I go there's no work out so i'm like off, but I mean so. I love a little bit of time go by, though probably about a month or so, or whatever, and then I went back down there. And I just walked in for the offices and this lady she's like can I help you and i'm like yes, like you, guys got any noise does that need graded. And she's like you great voices before I like acts like come in my office and I went in an office and fucking Bam fuckin she's like when you want to start looking up.

Like there's a lot of feathers ship doing this job I can stay at work that for a while. i'm about to check out that trailer here soon i'm that trailer saying about."
724.0,Provider,yeah that was gonna be my next question what's going on with that.
6189.0,Patient,"Well, I think it's a different one because I talked to the guy about it right, and I think that it's his wife, who owns it or something, because they had this girl staying there last. And she just left a bunch of shit and and stuff like that I haven't really talked about yet actually since you're talking about telling about helping them move stuff mountain shit yeah that's the one I have told you about this one. yeah yeah so. yeah I really talked to my brother in law's partner is the one I think his wife, has it, I think that they own it because my sister is talking about about something like him. paying for it but nobody's even there for anything I mean so he has to it's his trailer they own it, I guess, and he's paying rent just to keep in the place where they have. The sooner the sooner that they get I told him that i'm ready, I mean i'm like i'm ready to share and he gets cleaned up and ready to go for me. To be collected. morning said. yeah yeah exactly you know so i'm like man, you know I I gotta talk to him, I think he's here now but yeah I just haven't seen him yet been here all weekend or anything i've been wanting to. Go check out buying machine personally myself yet."
724.0,Provider,"And you gotta you can drive, so you got access, I mean if you find out what the addresses, I would just drive by on your free time if you got any and just check it out see what the location looks like see what the structure looks like because it could be like. It could be like in awesome shape and you'd be like I don't know what the holdup is it looks pretty clean from you know, or it could be a disaster, so be good to at least get your eyes on and see what what the situation is one way or the other."
6189.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah cuz like my fucking head I it could be a mess now I might not even on it, but guys. I heard about it i'm pretty stoked about it, you know I mean like I hope they really is nice I my sister was telling me that they just put new flooring in it CIT not long ago. But like she said she ain't seen it yet since that lady listing and I guess like to have kind of a tweeter saw I guess you know what's. But like I got me a nice little spot right now, for now, until that opens up like I had this guy working on in this room out over here at my brother in law's shop, but then like this was last weekend, or whatever and. Then they told me about the trailer that he started i'll start talking about the trailer again, so I said okay. Well i'm ready right, I mean like if it could be ready by Friday this classify it as fast by shut off the stove you know I mean but uh so I told the dude to start cleaning up the room that he is cleaning out on me because, but can I haven't planned to be moving soon. So now I just thought this bed just not too long ago I played and I got this little spot in there, right now, it's now it's like. kind of like, just like in the shop to unite and spot in a room in the shop so it's like I got this bed, just like kind of like right in front of this garage door shit fucking.

724.0,Provider,"Did you get any of that when you introduce that any of that any that medication, while you were incarcerated because I know like that that seems to be like a push now and, like correctional settings is that they're getting people like. Who are coming in, for. suboxone weather in."
6189.0,Patient,"yeah no not really yeah but I know I seen a couple people are on what they are there, though, like that tag or the suboxone or whatever the hell, it was that they had yeah. yeah they got that new program or whatever the hell, it is going on there, how to it's kind of cool you know but yeah I was I had tried. To help. Like go sleep in the evening and shit."
724.0,Provider,"Good you know, taking a little now. So no issues sleeping on on you can do it on without the assistance and like no one telling him. that's good. yeah I would imagine that trying to fall asleep naturally and correctional settings is not easily done. yeah I worked in correctional settings and. anytime anybody asked me what it was like it was like it's loud all the time just loud I got enough I don't know what else ages it's always loud. i'm some medication, because any upcoming doctor's appointments or anything."
6189.0,Patient,"i'm supposed to make a doctor's appointment, actually, though, but then I got this letter, and now, but can I go while ago for. 12 weeks. 12 weeks blood tests for my head ch ri I just did it so but I need to go on, I need to get that done some time but I haven't. I just don't want admission work really I mean like I know for this doctor's appointment i'm not have to do it early in the morning or soft so I mean there's an APP is this. Go to work and then take off real quick for a little bit real quick don't get it done or just like kind of what I thought about doing this because I know that my half she and everything's all good I mean like. it's just the blood tests that they want to do."
724.0,Provider,They want to check your viral.
6189.0,Patient,"yeah and like I really should get it done, you know, but I thought that maybe like sometime down the road, I can make an appointment. In going and just get retested, for you know I mean I just be the same as doing my blood tests, I guess you know, and then, if it came back negative and Bam and I know that it works, but."
724.0,Provider,"I think one is know that what they want to make a check like here I think it's like the anti. Body level or they check something and then, if it's like not reporting and then you're pretty much good to go what they don't want to happen is that. You got to such a level that maybe one more treatment and you'll be good to go, but you did it and then you know. It redevelop so that's kind of why they want you to like constantly check until it's like zero practically and then at that point you wouldn't like a like a safe when they were there, just like now you're good."
6189.0,Patient,"yeah because I did want to have, and I mean I think us after like there's there's a six week blood test or whatever, however long it is. And when they did that one it came back, as none detected, so I was like Okay, you know that's cool within it's already it's really worked pretty good yeah i'm not like halfway through my treatment so. Again, it was already at 90 texted so you know i'm like i'm pretty sure it's good but as."
724.0,Provider,Well that's awesome.
6189.0,Patient,"I don't like. It So when I hate to have to tell my supervisor, something that I gotta take off or something like that you know I mean I just try to be there as hot."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's understandable, but you got to take care of your health to like if you're you know, for whatever reason, even in the future, like it you're no good at work if you're no good to yourself, so you know."
6189.0,Patient,"that's what my body was saying to us like well you know. We are getting older, you know we got a really fun on that kind of stuff yeah. So, like I got to make that appointment and either way because the doctor is what it's meant to be like eight o'clock or something so. I started at six I just keep going like a look i'm gonna have to take off real quick or this when he said. This to try to just run there, make it for my first break you know I mean, then, run up there on my break and on my lunch break. And I could probably get it done, but I was thinking out right here i'm gonna have to wait for i'm going to be wait in the waiting room for an old time it's my lunch breaks, then, by the time I was young, I mean so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that and they probably take their lunch break around the same time, everybody else takes our lunch break, so you never want to make an appointment at like noon, or one or 11 because. In the medical Office like that's when they're taking their lunch break too, so you have to wait till staff got back before you can get seen so maybe maybe go to work. First, in the morning and then just go to work late and then. Stay the extra hour, you know, make the time. that's probably the move."
6189.0,Patient,"On I can go to work, I can still go to work I started shake shack and I go and work that first two hours to take off on my point girl quick. And just do it, and just come back and I can even run up, but I think there's one of my co workers there you know I mean like I don't want to like to play myself or anything like that so there's somebody else no but like. it's like this is this do like you know fucking leave work when he saw on the clock. To go pick this fight. You know i'm like damn you know I mean like it's just like it's crazy. either on the wiki here mission or reason to be late, I mean like two hours late. lively and give her a ride or or some shit like that i'm just like have a meeting with me and my homeboy we talked about he found were like damn. Up he's doing it all the time, like. he's still a good worker and a lot, you know, but like are saying I."
724.0,Provider,mean he said later took one of the owners.
6189.0,Patient,that one day I seen him leave you know I mean I don't know I think we're like we were on our lunch breaks or something and it wasn't a lunch break if you know clock in you know I mean he just took off and i'm like yeah he's gone and he comes back like a little bit later on. But whatever it is. But that's what I also think. Though that. Real quick that.
724.0,Provider,"Was the second you do that, you get caught and then get cans so."
6189.0,Patient,"So I would talk to my supervisor first about it so before every day, I mean i'd ask him, I get his opinion, first, although it would be best I mean should I clocked out in lead to do my doctor's appointment because i'm gonna be gone after Dr john I want to be caught in the work was gone. So you know he'll provide like. A clock out and log back in like back to my point."
724.0,Provider,"That be the probably the root yeah i'd be the right thing to do. All right, well that's a wrap on me um you owe a couple surveys, it said in the system so just make sure you're on top of your surveys."
6189.0,Patient,Okay. How do I get that like yo I go to a virtual clinic or a compliance or something to them my email because I get a different you know I got a whole different phone with email and stuff.
