416.0,Provider,"Well, I will also. You know, hold that rule."
8295.0,Patient,"yeah I just I he. I told him that we need to figure out how to communicate because he looks like i'll say something, and he takes it a total different way that I mean it, you know what I mean. And we need to figure out a way that we can communicate back and forth that we're not taking offense or. Being offensive or things like the way I would, if I want to continue to work on the relationship with with him, you know. I want to focus on my body image issues that i'm having and try to get over that that's a big thing for me because. You know I."
416.0,Provider,what's going on with your body image issue.
8295.0,Patient,"Well, you know I just feel like like whenever when I start to think about if I were to ever date again and stuff like. Like when i'm naked I feel so gross looking you know because I had this huge guard down my belly. Where they had to cut me when I had that emergency surgery and and where it's grown back together there's like skiing that hey it's terrible it's so gross looking and I just. i'm so ashamed like I can't imagine taking your clothes off and press somebody but I don't want to feel that way, I want to be able to I mean i'm not dead i'm still young I was still like to. You know what I mean you know, maybe get a piece of ass I mean just to be honest about it, you know before I die, you know, but just I mean I don't want to be embarrassed by that you know, I would like to be comfortable in my own body, you know. And I really bothers me real bad and you know where i've lost all this weight and I don't have any brands anymore, you know and i'm just really self conscious about my image, you know and i'm gonna we're working on that. I just want it to be better all around and i'm going to make a bet it's going to be better all around because this last year, so pretty bad and if it's gonna. there's anything is going to be better than that, so you know I just I just want to look at it, like you know i'm going to get me a tattoo as matter of fact, a meaningful care to i've decided. i'm going to start out with like a family tree and the roots are going to be like the rates in cursive will be at my grandparents names and then going up to the branches will be like my family's name. And i'm hopeful that often that i've got a few like mental health, a little pictures and things that i'm gonna hit on there, but I just want a fresh start like a clean slate and I kind of feel like this beginning of this year's as a new fresh start for me so. yeah."
416.0,Provider,Have you thought about getting that tattoo over the scar.
8295.0,Patient,"At know because there's no way like it's a where the scar is together has come together and i've had weight loss surgery the skin hangs from both sides of the scar like hangs down there wouldn't be any way to to I need to have it removed I need to have the skin removed. But where i'm not healthy enough to go under surgery right now I can't do that you know, but my insurance will pay to have it corrected because of it, you know the weight loss surgery, and all that stuff and it being you know and it hangs it like kind of hangs the skin and it's really. it's painful like I mean it makes me, it makes me hunched over my hunch because. Where it. You know, so it does bother no back, but so anyway, that I have to be healthy enough to go under the knife that that's one of my goals is to focus on getting taking better care of myself and you know getting it, you know pins."
416.0,Provider,In concrete steps that you can take like in that direction.
8295.0,Patient,Well i've got to. i've got to take my medicine appropriately like my vitamins and things like that the protein that i'm supposed to have to do that in order to put weight on in order to start hating him here I has one thing I have to do.
416.0,Provider,When when did you have weight loss surgery.
8295.0,Patient,"And it's been. Five years ago, maybe now."
416.0,Provider,"So you had weight loss surgery, and then you lost like too much weight is that would."
8295.0,Patient,"have had weight loss surgery, and I did really good well. I started to take care of pepper my dad and I just was just tore up all the time of nerves, though I got an ulcer in my stomach. And where I just was avoiding eating and also start well a perforated open and and they called the call the ambulance. They had me on the operating table within 40 minutes from amulets well when I got to the or a coded I quit breathing so had to bring me back. And then I had a had a blood clot mellower long they were worried about all that, so I had to be on like this, feeding. I was hooked up to a PIC line of feeding and feeding two for one month I lived with my mom and they had to feed me through an rv and stuff that was because of the ulcer. They also had perforated and opened up so when they cut out the Ulster in the band tissue. There wasn't very much stomach left in there, so my stomach is smaller than a week it was small before, when I had the weight loss surgery. And that wasn't what hurt me, it was the ulcer that caused me to have somebody problems, so that i've got a new bleeding ulcer now and i'm really excited about that we just tell you it's there's the shit out of me but i'm hoping that I can. maintain this one, you know in it."
416.0,Provider,"You know, did they put you on like a special diet to."
8295.0,Patient,"And you have to. Well, you just not you don't really have to be on a special diet, you have to avoid like aspirin things like that. As far as dietary you know you don't want to eat if you eat like stuff like you know hot spicy stuff it's going to burn your holster that as far as medications it just has to heal on its own. You know, it has to heal and but the thing about the last one is I was avoiding taking care of it at all like I didn't even know it was there and. I mean it just eroded so much of my good, healthy skin tissue in my stomach away, they had to cut so much of it out when they put me back together, there was, you know very little stomach laughs. Though, but when they cut me that kept me from underneath my breath away my pubic bone and you know they send me back together when they saw me back together, they suddenly crooked. Like one part when you know it was like they didn't put it together straight so it's like off off sad a little bit, but it. was terrible That was the sickest i've ever been on the dod pretty much died, you know that I woke up on the ventilator and obviously you 14 days later, I had no idea what had happened. My mom's friend that used to be my mom's nurse that works for her at the hospital, I think the wagon and she's telling me she's like. No don't pull their teeth in your in your mouse he's like just come, you know your your and I see you, you know and she's trying to explain to me and i'm just like oh my God, I did not know what was going wrong. last thing I remember, I was at my dad's and I remember I just doubled over and I told him to call my mom and and and that's it, but thank God i'm."
416.0,Provider,Casey you've been through a lot.
8295.0,Patient,"You know I went through I mean I went through shock, thank God, because the neighbor said that I will screen so while it's don't remember another night. and thank God that your body they put you put you in shock because i've been so amazing to me how that works that way you don't feel the pain, you know what I mean. It just was run. But yeah I am but then after that I had to come home to I was in the hospital from December to March, and not one person came to the hospital visit me. Nobody my family, well, I told my mother to stay home because my son, but yeah they treated me pretty shitty it was really messed up, I had a really hard time the lunch, ladies. i'll got to know me and came up and spend Christmas with me today was very sad everything was but anyway so December to March and then, when I came home I stayed at my mom's and from March to. It was like march to December I think Marshall December I had to pick one and I had to be hooked up to that machine for 18 hours a day to be fed. And so I had to carry around this this like IV bag thing 18 hours a day, I couldn't go anywhere oh God it was terrible it was so bad, but. They were gaining they were giving me, you know vitamins and nutrients through my or the and then after that I had to feed myself through my dummy to to you know feed into but you know, but they once I gained out to like 130 pounds I got to have it out so."
416.0,Provider,"So, are you able to. you're able to be normal."
8295.0,Patient,"No, no, not at all. No problem my problem is I get so hungry that when I sit down to eat I ate I tend to eat real fast and overeat or, then what happens, I have to throw up because I have no room for it go. So what what the ideal is to eat small amounts all throughout the day and that's been real hard for me to do you know."
416.0,Provider,My way.
8295.0,Patient,"of eating what I don't i'm not really sure I don't I guess because i'm used to sitting down and eating, just like a meal here uh meal that you know, like for supper sit down for supper and eating a big supper and then you know. I just get busy throughout the day I mean I don't think about you know stopping I mean they're wanting me to eat every two hours you know sit down and eat a little meal. You know that makes will grow up thinking about it and It just seems so much, but like I said I get so hungry that when I sit down, I overeat. But the protein supplements that i'm supposed to have, I think they want me to have 70 grams of protein a day, and so they make these. fakes and things like that and that's one thing that I really need to one of the concrete things that I need to speak to is getting the protein in that way, my weights things you know, and I don't lose any weight, because I never ever in a million years wanted to ever lose this much. weight like even when the weight loss or weight loss surgery happened because of my back. They wanted me to get the weight off of my back you know because I had lost control of my bladder bladder and my vows due to my back. And I was so heavy and couldn't exercise and I wait to 40 is what my top white was, but when I was having those back issues it just made it much worse. So um yeah but, so I had to weight loss surgery, and then I lost I lost down and I got really healthy I was really in shape I was working out and I looked so good, I was about 150. At the lowest in, and that was that was I was actually to kind of to little i'd like to be that. You know that I lost down, I was in shape and then, when dad and pepper got sick and I started just. I was tore up all the time, you know and i'm worried worried worried and when you worry, you know throws acid down into your stomach you know and it erodes it it just eroded away it's terrible that so. that's that's all that happened."
416.0,Provider,And Casey have you tried. Like setting an alarm every two hours and keeping protein like the little protein shakes and stuff in your purse.
8295.0,Patient,"i've, no, no, I have not i've not tried that i've got protein shakes and stuff here that I haven't may not have access to them about you know have them that i've not."
416.0,Provider,been like if you're out and about you might want to stash someone remembers.
8295.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm terrible with tongue in terrible with that whole thing I need to figure something out that works best for me, I have not tried that yet that it would be a good thing for me to trump."
416.0,Provider,Probably if you put on an alarm for every two hours.
8295.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going to try, that I want to try that like today, I put on alarm for our appointment because. Actually I got on this morning, I thought it was it nine for some reason don't ask me why I just I don't know what it is that hits lock, that is, I am the worst with it, that is my problem that I had."
416.0,Provider,"With without okay. I mean it is what it is right, but it just means that you have to put in more. You have to have more of a system that other people who don't struggle with that right."
8295.0,Patient,"And it's not that you know it's, not that I don't care or that my mom takes it as. offensive black black is against her like if i'm supposed to be at her house, at a certain time and i'm like she thinks that there's something else i'd rather be doing or blah blah blah blah blah, you know what I mean. So she thinks that well if you cared enough about me then you would be here on earth, you know what I mean, but it has nothing totally to do with that it really doesn't. It doesn't know. it's it's almost like Dooley it's almost like when I know that I have a date to do something I start to panic about it. Like if it said does that make sense, like if there's a set if there's there's there's something that said I almost get really. anxious about it and i'm not sure why, but I do and that's for everything if there isn't because now here lately i've been telling people. i'll see you later let's not make no plans, because every time I make plans they always get screwed up, it seems like so it's like you know i'll be there when I get there, I see it, you know, whatever I."
416.0,Provider,Know it's fair.
8295.0,Patient,I don't know.
416.0,Provider,But what if you did you know use use the technology that's available to you around this right. Because you know that does actually work for you you're usually does help.
8295.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, I will I will do that and that's like I said that's one thing that I need to focus on is the getting my health back to tip top shape and being healthier and. You know in eating and it's, not that I don't want to eat because i'm so hungry awesome another thing that makes it difficult for me is having dangerous now. that's been the hardest things i've had to face is having dangerous because it's so hard to to food. You know, completely and then where i've got the other issue with most of it if I don't get it chewed up small enough it doesn't go through my esophageal junction down there the junction and I can't. throw it up, so my teeth that you know it just makes it hard you know i'm going to make an appointment and give me a new set of dangers to see if maybe that might help because data, where my bottom ones now because they don't see it. yeah and. I think it, you know if maybe I could find some that work, maybe, maybe it would help my eating habits."
416.0,Provider,yeah it sounds like you just were not me properly for you.
8295.0,Patient,"This it's been I can I never knew how hard it would be to have I mean really like. I can't like I can't take about it like a burger or pizza you know you can't take a bottom like an apple or P, or you can't I can't find a pickle. I can't you know, like a lot of the foods and snacks we had for Christmas like I couldn't either like candies and a thing with nuts, or you know because against you, it up so it's a bummer. date."
416.0,Provider,"So so there's kind of some I mean, are you writing these things down like I do write lists of things that you want to do."
8295.0,Patient,"No, no, but you know that would be something that I probably could do that would help me."
416.0,Provider,Do you have a paper we can do it right now.
8295.0,Patient,it's a compound word. yeah hold on just a second okay. Okay.
416.0,Provider,"Good. So, with regard to the dentures what's the first step, you need to take."
8295.0,Patient,I need to make an appointment I needed if I could just.
416.0,Provider,let's write that down.
8295.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,Something that you could potentially even do after this right. Right yes.
8295.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm going to."
416.0,Provider,Read and then you get to have the satisfaction of crossing that off the list.
8295.0,Patient,"Okay Okay, yes I can't even think about that. Okay, for some reason i'm stuck on today Sunday for so I felt like it Sunday all day for some reason."
416.0,Provider,The holiday just threw everything on didn't.
8295.0,Patient,"All right, and then."
416.0,Provider,And then you. mentioned going into your phone and. Putting it on. an alarm for when you need to eat so don't remind you.
8295.0,Patient,"Yes, alarms every two hours. Then."
416.0,Provider,You could do that today.
8295.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm going to do that."
416.0,Provider,we're gonna have fun.
8295.0,Patient,"After I make my DEMO make the dance, for the first. Okay okay and i've already forgot everything, as I said, listen, I think. Oh yeah I need to find a therapist it takes how How would I what would I look for when up to, for that would talk to me and medicine both How would I go about finding that."
416.0,Provider,i'm.
8295.0,Patient,Like what are they called or.
416.0,Provider,"You know I would call your insurance and look for a therapist that could do family sessions, I mean honestly Casey I could do it, but. It might be best. To have somebody more neutral since i'm in your therapist. Like I wouldn't I would want your Center feel really safe like it was somebody who didn't you know. You have. An opinion about things going in already."
8295.0,Patient,Right right.
416.0,Provider,um so. You just contact your insurance.
8295.0,Patient,So it's called just a family.
416.0,Provider,therapist which is be a family therapist who is willing to do sessions with you and your son couple sessions.
8295.0,Patient,We both have insurance. Perfect so.
416.0,Provider,Maybe you could go through his insurance since you're already going through yours for us.
8295.0,Patient,"OK OK OK OK all right, and you can. See. i'm going to get me a journal and write stuff down i'm going to get me I had one and I lost it somewhere so i'm gonna get me a book like a like a calendar journal, but one do that today to Turner. All right. Anything else that I was."
416.0,Provider,"Those were the first two that you mentioned, and then yeah your relationship with your son so you've got you got three really good ones. yeah let's not overwhelm you with more let's start over and the thing about this is is like it snowballs in a positive way, once you start with a couple little things right, like you were mentioning you know I want to feel better about my body and whatever. But it's like one thing leads to another, so, if you remember to you know you remember to eat a little more frequently and you get your health and your weight stabilized a little bit. Then you will be able to have the skin repair surgery, and then you will you know so it's like those things it's those little steps that then snowball so all it has to start with, is just one snap."
8295.0,Patient,"Okay okay yeah I feel good about it yeah that's awesome. yeah okay all right that's awesome right, it makes me feel good It makes you feel better."
416.0,Provider,"Now so after this you've got you know, two things you can do, and you can save the next thing for tomorrow, if that feels overwhelming or you can do them all today."
8295.0,Patient,i've what i've got my. psychiatric evaluation tomorrow with the new. Whatever through there than nurse practitioner whatever and tomorrow morning.
416.0,Provider,Are you doing good.
8295.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'm kind of dread and I love it. I mean what did they when they do in a valuation like that what is that what does that entail what are they what they do.
416.0,Provider,and ask you ask you about your your life and where you are and I don't know they might do some testing. How does it do that over the phone. I mean How did the questions.
8295.0,Patient,Oh OK OK yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And then they you know they just look at your they're asking you specific questions about your mental health right so. A lot of the stuff is stuff that's probably already covered with you and me, but they might ask you more. Right so they're going to be like who your trauma your current symptoms that kind of thing and for you know so much of it is about you know the anxiety. And the concerns about your memory and your focus and that kind of thing and. So yeah they'll just be talking to you about that, and then they decide if there's maybe a medication that can help. yeah I think. I think it probably is."
8295.0,Patient,"yeah yeah um yeah I have you know another school so really crazy but whenever i'm with that you know and i've talked about this a lot, but my house overwhelms me I could contain. The shape my house gets in, and you know because I grew up having like a clean House I had chores you know, and so, when it's this rate my life when you can tell how my life is going, by the way my house looks pretty much. And and that's the truth but it's like whenever I know, like the next day Okay, like, I want to set out to clean up the kitchen today let's just example. i'll sit here and i'll just be like you know I just you know I can't do it, I can't get it done, but if i've got somebody here. Like say, for example, my aunt comes over and we go in there, we start to do it it's almost like I become super woman, I can all of a sudden, do everything was nobody's here."
416.0,Provider,And it's that's the overwhelm that you're experiencing right.
8295.0,Patient,being overwhelmed.
416.0,Provider,"You get overwhelmed in your own space, but not other people's face right. Right right or when somebody is there to help you focus and make."
8295.0,Patient,"That well that's what I was telling my mom you know, like if somebody is there to like keep me on point like just they don't ever even have to necessarily do anything but it's. Just like somebody a human being is here that I don't know talk to me I don't know. I can get everything done it's like I told my mom I said mom and my mother don't would come in a heartbeat and help me do everything Okay, she would in a heartbeat but I don't want her to have to do that, so therefore I don't allow her to do that, you know. So i'll you know first hurdle say I don't understand. You know why my family doesn't just come and just just it would take one day I can knock it out right and i'll you know office and also understand you know wish they would just come help me blah blah blah. Because it's true like if if we would just knock it out it that quick because that's how we do you know, like when we would go to my. Parents House you know we would just be talking sitting around and just pick it up, while we're sitting talking, you know, and it would be done before we knew it. You know, and that it's just strange how like when i'm sitting here and I have the whole day don't have anything to do that I can't get shit done, you know I just don't I don't make any sense to me."
416.0,Provider,it's actually pretty normal.
8295.0,Patient,"But I don't know how to fix it. I don't know how to do it, I don't know what I do need to do to. to fix it that's what i'm not things that. need to work on as well, like, how can I stay focused on the task at hand, instead of going to a million tasks, you know and starting a million things and I need to focus on completing the task at hand that one task you know."
416.0,Provider,Have you ever been diagnosed with ADHD.
8295.0,Patient,i've not been a lot of people ask me that i've had a lot of different people asked me that i've never had that my son was diagnosed with. He had a dd he didn't have the hyperactivity part. You see it add. That i've not something that you may want to when you meet with the.
416.0,Provider,"For the psych EVAL tomorrow, why don't you ask her about that."
8295.0,Patient,Okay i'll do. What.
416.0,Provider,"you're describing is. So much add stuff the focus the memory this these struggles, a lot of it is. Add it that's what you're describing anyway symptoms now, having said that trauma. Can mimic those symptoms to trauma can produce a lot of the same sentence and so it's really hard sometimes to separate out what is trauma brain and what is a dd or ADHD so, but the nurse practitioner or doctor or whoever it is history in your about tomorrow, can help with that."
8295.0,Patient,it's a female.
416.0,Provider,I can't remember her name Romany.
8295.0,Patient,notice the other one.
416.0,Provider,yeah something like that mm hmm.
8295.0,Patient,"No Dominique and I was scheduled to see her, and then it got canceled locked twice and so Dr Jackson told me to ask to see the other one because she wanted me to see sooner. Then, because that don't make was put out so far her first appointment, so they put me with that, I hope, I hope that she's good too."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I think she is she's just newer than Dominique so she's not as busy she just hasn't gotten slammed yet there's been such a need for such a long time for all of our kind of see patients to be seen for evaluations like this and to get some support. That we know as soon as dominate came all of us were like Oh, I can see everybody, you know so she got."
8295.0,Patient,"I can, I can I can I can imagine. I mean no I really can't i'm sure she's very busy."
416.0,Provider,"yeah so it's because it's so hard for you guys over there, to find a crazy that's I mean."
8295.0,Patient,"I know it's crazy I think it's crazy. I don't think that it should be that hard to what state are you in. California every I don't think that should be that hard to. Like one time one time, I was I don't remember if I was looking for myself or someone else but. It was like trying to find somewhere like to go for somebody was suicidal I can't remember or like a in patient care, and I remember saying to my mom if it's this hard to find help it ain't no wonder that nobody does it, you know it's no wonder, because. I couldn't find any you know I can't remember exactly what it's for but I remember specifically saying it and that's sad that it's like that. Like really so my grand."
416.0,Provider,"yeah It is sad it's not okay um, which is why we were so excited when dominate came on board and we have two people, which is so great, because, hopefully, you know. We see a lot of what is going on with you right which is like you are doing so well in your recovery and you're working so hard on your recovery, but the mental health stuff it keeps popping in right and it's just like this thing that keeps dragging you back. And unless we work on that stuff simultaneously. It just it just is it's dangerous for you guys."
8295.0,Patient,"It well it's so easy so easy to just. I don't know if he's right we're a bit like it's so tempting is not the right word either, but like when all this shit comes up to just be able to want to go get high you know and just know that you know what I mean it's just. That money."
416.0,Provider,"And a lot of people start using to begin with. yeah it's like that what they're going through is so painful and so frustrating they don't see a way out, then exactly they just go for the numbing and, of course, of course, that's how it is, which is quite important for us to kind of you know, work on both things at the same time."
8295.0,Patient,"You know I started off the pain medicine was the prescribed you know because of my back well, of course, you know my back hurts so bad, and then I just took more and more and more, will it began to where. I would take too many and run out, and so I would have to borrow from my family or whatever it well, then it became a family didn't want to give me no more, so I would have to buy from the street. You know just pain pills for my back that the gym I was legitimately taking them for my back at the time, you know the pain, but then it becomes to where you start to get where you don't have them you get sick, you know. So then you're like wait a minute so, then you just got to take him to feel normal so it's like this vicious cycle that began from. You go into the doctor, you know from getting you know and it's so scary to think that I don't know I just it's sad it's you know I never in a million years you know, because when I worked in healthcare my whole life and I never in a million years thought that I would. Be on the opposite side of the you know. Looking at. The attic you know, in the you know and. I hate it for so long, you know. The fact that I was doing it, you know and work in it and that's so hypocritical of me, but I did you know. I don't know that it is, but it's that easy it's that easy I mean I was telling my son, you know, because he has kidney stones and they prescribed him paint I told him I said, you know don't take to it, you know it's the eight don't take long, it does not take long. No, it does no."
416.0,Provider,yeah and it's common. it's your story is. all too common I mean it's yeah it's a problem.
8295.0,Patient,"And everybody wants to blame the health care providers, but I mean. they're. You know yeah that they're doing, and you go to the doctor you're hurting they're going to give you medicine, you know the see here's where it comes if they don't. do anything to help the like you know what I mean, but if they just continue to just do this and just be that all here will shut them up right and that's different. But like if you've got an actual doctor that's just giving you the medicine and then you have surgeon, they were they supposed to do, I mean they're not Superman you know I don't know."
416.0,Provider,"how well they could do more like what Dr Jackson does right which is talk about all the ways to handle pain, not just medication. run, I think this is one of my favorite things about her as a doctor and just as a human she talks a lot about how pain management should not be solely based on drugs, it should be based on you know you've got to move. In remove you've got to stretch you've got a breed. you've got to manage your mental health you've got to you know use warm compresses and ice and ibuprofen and you know stuff that doesn't have anything to do with opiates yeah. I love her so light again right. Dr Jackson is brilliant a hot bath right she's brilliant about that because it's like it's almost like we forget, we just look for a drug answer."
8295.0,Patient,easy fix yeah.
416.0,Provider,"yeah and it's and it's not it's there's plenty of other ways to do this and yeah they don't give you the same kind of quick fix but. But they work, and you know getting to a place where you can kind of be on the minimal amount of opiate medication and then supplement it with all the other stuff that you know works is the healthiest way to probably manage this kind of stuff right so."
8295.0,Patient,"I. I had a doctor tell me that I would probably be on suboxone the rest of my life, because I was talking about. At the time, he was my master box and Dr before I was talking about, you know, trying to taper off of it or whatever and. The way he told me he thought he said that he didn't think that that would be ideal for me, because he says that. With my back in shape and it is, and he had you know it kind of you know, can be used for pain as well, or whatever. And he seemed to think that that would be just something that, when he said that I would probably be on it, the rest of my life is what he said, you know one way, I think about that I think it's terrible and then the other way I look at it, I can see, I guess kind of what you."
416.0,Provider,"think you can have that conversation with Dr Jackson and see if she shares that opinion it wouldn't surprise me if she didn't. yeah if she was able to help you identify other things to be able to do, or maybe again like even if you are on suboxone for the rest of your life. Taking the very you know the least amount yes right because you have built in so many other things that feel good to you yeah help you manage so Casey we're about out of time this."
