So she came in, on the day that I moved, I mean she came the night before so that she could be here and help unpack so they and then my accent in La Bella came over after work and so he came in and we had a couple of grandsons that were. Just sort of moping around they didn't want to work, you know. We had him collapsing boxes, this was not. A real hard hard thing so yeah it went well and billy's come over the last Tuesday Tuesday mornings before he goes to work he drops the boys off at 730 and then he comes over to me and. We did you he's really handy so he and I have been working on some major projects, you know getting my sleep number the King cow kingsley number reconnected because it was all off that I don't have the strength to do it and. You know other little things like that. And the girls are pushing me to pay him because he's like not part of the family anymore, but he and I have a much closer relationship than he and his mother, you know his family. So we sat down and I said Okay, I need to talk to you about this. I and the girls are pushing me to pay you and he was almost hurt you know because it's family it's not like you know. yeah comes over you don't say Oh, and how much do I owe you. You know. So, but I said the girls are pushing me and he goes Okay, so the next time they asked say it's none of their business. And I said I could do that I said i'll even take you to dinner or something, and he goes you don't have to do that this is family. And I said oh we'll just spend special time when we're not working. He said okay so."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you asked him, you know what it's good that you are assertive you went there and then it's like you know what now, this is my business and i'm going to handle it how I feel fit."
13814.0,Patient,"yeah it's sort of what I was telling him when my mom was on hospice the first time it was like two years before she died. And I said okay mom hospice told me I need to talk to you about this, and she goes Okay, she used to work at hospice so she understood, a lot of this stuff even with her alzheimer's and so she goes I said there talk telling me I need to tell you it's okay that you die. And she started laughing because she knew she wasn't dying and I said, and she go Kathy this is between gotten me and. i'm in control, you know she said, so I mean we had a good laugh billion, I did to you know it's like I can now say we discussed it and it's none of your business."
705.0,Provider,Thank you. yeah awesome and you know Kathy to I hope that you realize you just accomplished a move a movie it's usually the most stressful if we take the top three it's one of the top three. And you did it.
13814.0,Patient,"yeah and beth asked me text me the night before she goes, are you anxious or excited and I said i'm excited. And she goes that's good. So the anxiety wasn't getting to me. At all that much you know I did, I have to watch myself and just sort of pace, you know, it was very good having the girls here and. When the movers came I just sat in a chair, with a fan on in the garage instead okay that goes there it goes down this road system was set inside, you know so she could say Okay, this is where the couch goes, and this. Is where this goes and. you're expected at all."
705.0,Provider,And it was successful.
13814.0,Patient,uh huh. yeah I wasn't walking as much. Because of my feet and stuff like that and. I got to kid with the movers you know so.
705.0,Provider,"Again Kathy I hope that, if ever there's a period where you have any self doubt that you can reflect back and go, you know what I just orchestrated this huge move. Yes, and I was successful at it."
13814.0,Patient,"mm hmm. So yeah so i've gotten i'm almost to solar heating or solar stuff. i'm on the roof it's already into the permit at the city. I got a new take this hot water heater i've had the vent to my dryer cleaned you know there's so many different things, the House has been painted here I show."
705.0,Provider,"It looks beautiful, from what I can say oh how nice."
13814.0,Patient,Help the Turquoise says.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, I love that color and Oh, my goodness, you have a huge backyard for California and standards that's like that's like another apartment complex."
13814.0,Patient,"No, this is getting smaller than what they used to be and they're getting even smaller than this, you know so that there's some grass and I wanted to put some concrete out there and put. It was not a Pergola that's a word I was trying to remember the other day, but just a regular building type thing you know with a roof. If it rains in that kind of stuff and. I realized i've spent too much money and so i'm thinking of just adding looking at the concrete, I do have in the backyard and seeing if a patio table would work with that. So when I have family over. We can even maybe two different paths that you had a chair tables because there's concrete all the way down the side of the House to up to the front so there's a lot of concrete here so besides a little patio so yeah and then. i've been on next door, which has been really helpful."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, so."
13814.0,Patient,"i've already met the lady behind me. She noticed that i'd Come on, and. i'm asking people, what do you do about the mosquitoes they are so bad here."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13814.0,Patient,"Somebody finally said it's a new breed that has come into the valley and so all these people know I asked for bug zappers nobody has told me of bugs after I finally just ordered two different kinds, but one of them uses lysol no listerine mouthwash. In a spray bottle and she sprays, the grass in the bushes and under the picnic table. Five minutes before they go out and they get no mosquitoes."
705.0,Provider,"You know, again, good for you Kathy not only to get settled in maturity, making connections with your. neighbors. In your social media platform."
13814.0,Patient,"So people are going. i'm on here, I need to learn i'm on here, I need to learn to you know and so it's been very interesting seeing how many people are also having the same problem. Though I went ahead and went online to Amazon and pick two of the four and a half to five star ratings for one for the outside, one for the inside. And so they're supposed to get here, I think, Monday or something like that so i'm because I don't like getting bit so i'm trying, something you know. And then, if they work, I will let my group know."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and it's nice Kathy that you are like you know what this is something I have control over you know, not necessarily of what the mosquitoes do, but this is what I can do. And yeah yeah and you're exploring and getting alternatives and then making your own decision. mm hmm empowering."
13814.0,Patient,"yeah so I felt in Gardner I haven't found the housekeeper yet. I yeah I found one housekeeper that she only does airbnb and I think I scared her off with my tone. It was the day before moving in and she was taking for ever, she was supposed to clean the whole apartment and my whole house and really what I wanted her to it wasn't the whole House, I just wanted her to do the bathrooms. And it was like almost an hour on one bathroom. And it wasn't even done well. Can you just get to the other one so she was supposed to show up two days later, and she never showed up and she hasn't contacted me so."
705.0,Provider,Not a good match.
13814.0,Patient,Not a good job.
705.0,Provider,"Not a good job, not a good match and it's like. Again it's pulled back to your decision. you're making your choices, and this is such a huge you know different chapter of okay here's how we're doing things here it's like this new environment that you have."
13814.0,Patient,"mm hmm so. And I finally letting days ago in the backyard by herself that was two days ago. So she sort of looked at me like are you coming out with me and it was in the morning, and it was cold. So I know i'm staying in here i'm going to go get dressed so and she did fine you know she's but she's peeing on the carpet some. she's getting."
705.0,Provider,men to.
13814.0,Patient,yeah she is. yeah as part of the problem.
705.0,Provider,And she's sharing with you that hey This is my house to now i'm going to market a bit.
13814.0,Patient,"Well, the carpet guy when he was laying the new carpet and stuff it was he goes most dogs will pee along where they connect the two pieces and there's tape under it. He said, because one of the we started in this their dog peed a lot in this carpet in their own carpet and it was a larger dog because of the dog doors that. Are into the garage and out to the side. So, but he said yeah this is, this is the same, and then he started pulling it up and it went like six seven feet right along the scene. He goes I don't know why that of course she's not paying on the scenes at all I know, I was sitting there, while they were installing so I know these aren't seems, but he goes out for some reason dogs like scenes."
705.0,Provider,As interesting haha but she also she knows that there was dogs there before.
13814.0,Patient,"uh huh I think so, and part of the thing is that. The pad that I put in, which is the top line pad. He was saying, I was trying to remember his name man I don't remember it. He said it's got a waterbury or on the top and the bottom, so that a lot of them, it goes the carpet and then they pee. And it goes into the pad. And when you try to clean it up, it it's in the pat so you're going to get dirt marks again so he said with this one, when you want clean the carpet it stops at the pad and then you can actually clean it up. it'll come out of the carpet. So yeah because I said I know dogs and she will pay. Some yeah I want to make sure that it doesn't get into the you know there's you can see it into the concrete. You know. that's where it was so."
705.0,Provider,"And you're taking it in stride it's like Okay, yes, like I said she said dog she's going to do this we're seeing what we can do about it. And not letting it run your day."
13814.0,Patient,"yeah, and this is giving me one of those spot. shampoo earth where you just put it over the top i'm not if i'm down here. So it's one that you know it's a big one, that she hasn't been using for a couple years and then yesterday I was reading in consumer reports because I became a Member, so I could see what kind of washer and dryers and refrigerators, and that kind of thing to. purchase and it said yes, those are much better than the spray. Putting the spray on it. So yeah by far. Yes, yeah. So I said Susan bring it on over I got some spots, that we can test on so."
705.0,Provider,She wasn't lots of things lots of things Kathy that you're like. A lot of moving parts right to move in. Somewhere new.
13814.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,How do you filled in with like your mental health that now you're moved in you dealt with the stress you're like here you're settled.
13814.0,Patient,"um. I want to just take my time now, so I have not done my bathroom at all, yet very little on my bedroom mostly because i'm sleeping in a different room so. That i've at least started putting some clothes away in the pantry I mean in my in my dresser and all my hanging clothes are in my bedroom too so Susan yesterday when she was here and I had to go run an errand to get her voice she came back. She went ahead and cleaned all the drawers out in my bathrooms because that hadn't been done, yet I had done the ones in the kitchen. So she went ahead and went in and did all that for me and started putting some stuff away, at least in the guest bathroom the hair dryer we've discussed where that was going to go so yeah it's just you know i've got this doubles sink. master. That i've got all this, you know, yes, I only have I think three drawers but i've got to sort of figure out where all my medications are going, you know all the cough syrup. And everything else, and the other day also I. I realized I wasn't taking care of myself as well that had been 60 days since I take a shower. And so I started crying a little bit with Susan and I said I, I want to go to costco with you because she was getting ready to go to costco and I said but I need to shower. So, luckily, it was very nice that the people that were before me were elderly, and so they brought me moved in at 70 also. 70 bucks but they had put security bars hold on bars in the shower in two different spots little it turns out their shower is the slippery shower I have ever stood up in I had to hold it I just shampoo my hair twice and got out. I was afraid I was going to fall, it was that bad because it was so slippery and it's the the little squares, you know the little ones, you know that are like this big. Right, so I got out as soon as I could you know rinsed off, but no salt so nothing so I got an Amazon and found some purple bath bath tub mats and I got two. So I can. lay them out next to each other and then that that's going to work so."
705.0,Provider,"it's just illusion you're all about the solutions are like this is not going to stop me from taking my shark because it would be easy to have that excuse like Oh, the the shower it's too slippery. But you're addressing it and that's why Kathy that you're like no i'm going to address it i'm making it happen."
13814.0,Patient,"So I found a thing to put shampoo on to because it doesn't have any shelves in it, you know it's a different one it's so but I checked the other bathtubs and they're bumping so I didn't I thought i'm going to check with those before I order and yesterday I got nine different boxes."
705.0,Provider,wow.
13814.0,Patient,"Not even sure what's in some of them so. Okay yeah. I just. You know just sort of. See beth wanted to buy me a house or to me gift, and so I got a coffee maker for them a cure rick I do not drink coffee tea, I have instant hot chocolate that I just microwave. So beth wanted me to or she wanted to offer me an organizational thing for the the curing coffee pods that she uses and everybody else in the family uses so and they've all brought over both beth fences and brought over there kinds that they like."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13814.0,Patient,"And the creamer that Susan likes with hers and yesterday, she made iced coffee and you know."
705.0,Provider,So yeah that's so.
13814.0,Patient,that's what I did it that was her house where we so that I could organize their coffee.
705.0,Provider,"And she's always a win for me, I went for you."
13814.0,Patient,How did you know I don't like.
705.0,Provider,clutter yeah.
13814.0,Patient,"And they were in ziploc bags and stuff so it. Susan I had her organized I said, you know about coffee you organize that. know anything about it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and, as I said again you're you're making things you know what works for you getting these systems. And then, what the self care to you know, having the daily routine of just getting up in the morning, I know you've been really busy, and now that you're in your House and more settled. I know you had said that maybe it was six days have you been able to do like sometimes there's other options of how to take care of in the morning, like you know, sometimes people do a wet one or sponge bath or."
13814.0,Patient,yeah no i've um. I was because I wasn't doing that much work I wasn't sweating.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13814.0,Patient,So um yeah I didn't feel dirty I just knew that I needed to take care of myself.
705.0,Provider,All quiet.
13814.0,Patient,"I just really did. and taking a shower so I know I now that I have my pads and stuff I need to go ahead and take another shower and do a thorough shower this time and just enjoy being in there, you know just thinking. Just enjoying showers."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13814.0,Patient,i'll kind of really like it.
705.0,Provider,"Except what was then Kathy when you shared that you know, then you, you said that you hadn't had a shower and several days and that you were tearful well what was going on at that time."
13814.0,Patient,"I I had two different options that I needed to do at the same time. Okay, one one of them was going to costco with Susan because she was she has food stamps right now and she's buying some of my food because I purchased food for them for three months. So she's. sort of paying me back on some of the stuff that I paid for, and so yeah she's still not doing a whole lot for me, but but I knew I needed to do a shower too, and it was very difficult for me to have to pick myself over what she wanted to do at the time. Okay, and I think that's the part where I had to say, I need to take care of. Myself, first I want to do that, but I need to take care of myself and susan's going month just go take care of we're fine. she's she's been very much like that you know it's not like well, I wanted to leave here five minutes ago she's take care of yourself the girls are being very much like that. Is there something I can do you know she wanted to come over yesterday, and I said, can we visit you know just sit and visit."
705.0,Provider,Right.
13814.0,Patient,"Now, and she does this is really nice just and then, when I was when she came back from her meeting then she went ahead, she knew I hadn't gotten to the bathrooms yet so she cleaned the drawers out and underneath the same. so that I can, and I was going to ask her to do that and I thought, no but she knew it needed to get done so she just did it."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13814.0,Patient,"You know, so it was just very nice that she knew something that needed to be done."
705.0,Provider,You know.
13814.0,Patient,got taken care of so.
705.0,Provider,"and putting yourself first to where it was your needs is a good way we're then if we say yes to things that we really want no, then we can harbor those resentments so you're not doing that you're just like look, this is what I need."
13814.0,Patient,"Like I think the other part two, is i've still been getting people coming by the House daily, if not one or two appointments. I think I have another one this afternoon, I know I have at least one or two tomorrow so that has been making me get up and get dressed. You know that's part of it, the good part it's just that i'm i've only getting ready for bed right before I need to go so it's not like i'm taking a shower after dinner and then relaxing in the evenings or anything like that, so I need to sort of figure out my routine. You know I think that's part of it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you're in a new place and so it's all like you said you're having all these people come in and out and managing that and then managing yourself care. At the end of the day, though you're making it work and you're like Kathy style not anyone elses."
13814.0,Patient,"mm hmm so I wanted to share something with you remember last time we talked about me picking the scabs. Yes, so to this last week I. it's gotten cooler over here it's only in the highest. or mid 70s. So it's not an entrance so i've been wearing capris which is self Defense today, I was getting dressed and I said Oh, I could put pants on so I did thinking what you had said. And it was cool enough for me to do that, but the next morning after our last meeting I was getting ready to pick something and I said i'm in control. And I wanted to tell you that it just sort of clicked in my head and going. I know. Was excited when I said and I keep it comes up every so often. When I was a child and married I had, I felt I had to be perfect. Or, no one would love me and so right now it's i'm in control and I do not have to be perfect."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness Kathy you are just on my big win big when."
13814.0,Patient,"was just. I can do this the way I need to be done, you know I mean it was it was so exciting this last couple of weeks thinking I don't have to be perfect anymore."
705.0,Provider,I.
13814.0,Patient,don't have to be perfect.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, that is just beautiful and the way that you have such power now where you're like No, I am in control."
13814.0,Patient,"So it's it's been good, you know Susan has talked to me once about my tone Western people. She goes everybody's having a problem I said, well, I, I agree, but she goes you're going overboard. So she talked with me about that so. Because it was a week later, when I moved in and the for sale sign was still out. So the next, I think it wasn't until. The following Monday that I called the guy this real attorney goes or Tuesday, and I mean it's been almost two over week and a half and it's still out there. And so I text him and I said I want the sign gone and, at the very end, I said, you know trashes coming Thursday. Susan thought that was a little harsh it wouldn't have made any difference if they'd left the sign on the side yard, for you know, a week or two as like that it was taken up that night and God 100%."
705.0,Provider,Right right.
13814.0,Patient,yeah so.
705.0,Provider,"wow wow you know again it's nice to that you could hear her out. You could absorb of how okay i'll be mindful of this and i'm not hearing that there was any internal dialogue of that need to be perfect it's like Okay, thank you, I will be mindful of that I am human I have things going on. And they just keep moving forward and it's like Okay, I will try the next opportunity that comes my way."
13814.0,Patient,"Yes, and take some deep breathing and. Yesterday was a little stressful I needed to get some new. ace bandages for my feet I got to the podiatrist and he told me, besides. Oh. it's the arch thing I can never remember what it's called I have problems with the arch, but I also have arthritis that it's forming in my feet. So that's the first time i've heard that and he wanted me to manage my feet for a while and do exercises and stretching and all that okay all right. um but trying to find the same thing that he did I went to my the third store and Susan and said mom take care of yourself i'm just going to stay here because. I told the girls with my parents selling the condo that I was going to give each of the girls some money and so beth finally asked how much it was going to be and how they were going to be receiving it and that kind of stuff and so. it's actually $70,000 each that i'm giving them."
705.0,Provider,One an amazing gift.
13814.0,Patient,"yeah and then like Susan said, and then, when you pass, we have the House there's just an additional you know, money that is getting passed down and so Susan came over that's one of the things she wanted to do is have me pay off Andrews car and her credit cards and one other things so. yeah so i'm keeping a journal, I have to start it for her we've decided to take a picture of it and put it into our photo album on inheritance or. grandma or something like that, and so that they can all look to see how there's they're doing, and they can each of them look to see what the other ones doing to it's not it's no secret. That any money, I give them from now on will come out of their inheritance. And it's not coming out of my pocket so."
705.0,Provider,"Again you're creating CAFE great systems that are working for you and that you're feeling good about this is my decision I have control over this, and this is what I choose to do."
13814.0,Patient,I just have to figure out how to make an album. And how to put a picture into the album but those are little things. yeah how did you get up here again.
705.0,Provider,she's so cute she is wanting to be part of your session and she's like I will not be ignored i'm right here she's cute.
13814.0,Patient,"let's put you over on this side. For a while that's already getting tired, so I. don't know how much more time we have because I don't have a clock here, but we still have like 15 minutes yeah so I."
705.0,Provider,"wanted to see to Kathy would it be easier on this end, for us to go ahead and schedule our next session, where you. Go. Okay, how does thursday's work best for you."
13814.0,Patient,"Let me get over here to my calendar, as far as I know I because i'm sort of open. yeah the 28th is fine. yeah so. yeah. so forth yeah any of those that's."
705.0,Provider,"Fine, did you one Okay, let me just see to this, so the 28th. Looking at the time here. It looks like if, on the 28th I have October the 28th it looks like though it would be afternoon, I can meet at three or four."

705.0,Provider,"Three is fine. Okay, so i'm going to put it down for three. And that's for October 28. Yes, Okay, and so i'm in a book that why we're talking and then that way, no one else takes the time slot."
13814.0,Patient,While we're talking yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, I know, sometimes two people can be looking at the same time, so i've learned i've learned when you when you i'm working with someone if we can go ahead and book it yeah."
13814.0,Patient,Because I know that book it outside too yeah.
705.0,Provider,"So overall then Kathy how you know, like so now you're you made the move you've done all of these great things of getting it, you know getting yourself there orchestrating all of the you know the fine details. Is there something now that you're thinking you know what this is what I want to focus on."
13814.0,Patient,"I think the anxiety is still there some it's popping up. With julie's group that I do on Monday mornings. I really feel that my depression is really under control. I felt very, very good and that's what i've been saying to them. it's more the anxiety that i'm dealing with. Some of the stuff that Valerie did or Valerie Julie did this last week on Monday was you know we're doing the. The meditation trying to bring ourselves, you know hold the breath close, you know that type of thing, but something she added was to sigh when you leave when the breath goes out. And she never done that, before. I didn't know how to say. It was. No. It was, it was very strange I don't know how to side so yesterday, when I was driving and I was at a stop sign I started trying to do my deep not closing my eyes."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
13814.0,Patient,"thought about that I go nope that's not on it so but I at least tried to do the deep breathing and trying to size so i'm getting better at the sighing you know, I think that that's. Something else that that you know, has added to it. yeah I wanted to let you know just real quick my daughter my middle one and the younger one are both doing balance 365. Really enjoying it and Nancy actually was one of the pot on one of the podcasts so it's been and it's only for women, my husband was accessible Joe was very upset that he couldn't join and they said he thought it was and they go we're women we know how women think we. Think. And they've all had different the. Two main ones there it's actually in the United States and Canada see how she's back up here again. But. One of the things that. they're further eating is that when you've eaten some and all of a sudden, you sit back and you go. Your full. Just by doing that, if you're paying attention. And you do that, you know that you are full, you should not be eating anymore. And I thought that was an interesting just it's actually really. But yeah it's just a side, and that was something that that the girls have been sharing that with me. They do not think that I need to do this they think it'll be too emotional for me. Because of some of the deep rooted things that I have had to deal with. See."
705.0,Provider,"she's very in tune with your you know when you're talking and your energy and she's just like we're just going to give some support here, because I, my mom."
13814.0,Patient,"So, but I thought that was an interesting thing to just sit back and you say, and that means you're finished."
705.0,Provider,"Great you're able to then utilize what you would learn anyhow, and so it's like okay so that's what your daughters are doing and then Kathy you're doing it your style your with bright heart health and then Julie, is giving you even extra like add ons. That you're getting to pick and choose if that's going to work for you and, if you like, that it's like in order to roll out things we have to explore."
13814.0,Patient,"beth said that she was really listening to a podcast when she was driving over here, and it was on motivation. And people can actually text in or whatever it is to them to ask questions and they go why can't I sustain my motivation. And they said, it is a feeling, you cannot sustain happiness or joy, why do you think you can motive, you know sustain motivation. And I thought that was an interesting way of putting it."
705.0,Provider,Right.
13814.0,Patient,"You don't have motivation, all the time. Exactly yeah so some of the stuff they're showing sharing with me to is very it's interesting to see where they're going. But also the information that they're Hello daisy."
705.0,Provider,Are you are you able to also share Kathy that some of the techniques that you're learning. is great to have in your toolbox and sharing out with your daughters.
13814.0,Patient,"Yes, I do. I do that too so."
705.0,Provider,"I learned so much to have just connecting with people every day I knew, one that was given to me was trying to breathe through a straw and so, if you're in a let's say a dining area. And you're feeling anxiety. is trying to breathe, through your straw that no one else can see and it's a technique."
13814.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,So I thought that's interesting.
13814.0,Patient,"Julie, it also said that she had somebody or it was something where when you're in a social so get down social gathering where you can use your fingers and you just you tap this is in. You know, and then hold it so that nobody notices. That you're counting. You know, and that was a good just another way of doing it somewhere else."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's great it's like tricks of the trade tricks of life, you know and how you're navigating through life and being able to self sooth and finding out again I think it's exciting with the exploring. Even just going like sometimes with the hands pressed people find comfort in that. So when you're out in public and you do this. it's self soothing for you, but yet no one's going to be like what are you doing it's just like yeah this is self soothing."
13814.0,Patient,"I have found to. That I actually the gentleman that came over to do to do the presentation for soft water and beth and Susan we're both here and I started crying and he and I did talk with his the next person up and she was going to talk to his supervisor about it. That something in his briefcase popped and it scared me and he started thinking it was a joke, I mean it was funny that I would and I said no, I have anxiety, this is affecting me he did not understand that in a laugh some more which hit me very hard. And beth came in. So. She goes, what did you clean up your supplies and and he says well Okay, and then you know he just did not understand and the girls said mom. It might be the way he reacts to situations, he does not understand is he laughs."
705.0,Provider,As a coping mechanism.
13814.0,Patient,"uh huh. When I talked with the supervisor I also said, this is what my daughter said, you know, but she said he needs I said, hopefully, the next time somebody says, I have anxiety. That he will understand more that he can't do that i'm going to do this i'm going to Okay, let me just sort of step away for a while, you know he's just said in his car until we were ready to have him come in, you know back in again. But you know she said that will he will learn, and so, when I went to my third place for medical supplies yesterday, trying to find these bandages and stuff for my feet. And she the lady asked me how I was doing and I says i'm a little anxious and she goes it's Okay, and I said no, I suffer from anxiety i'm actually telling her so she understood it wasn't anything else that was going on."
705.0,Provider,And I like that you're just saying it. You just get out there.
13814.0,Patient,"And she took care she understood what that meant. yeah and just went ahead and said, you know I just started, and she was watching how I was the queue. You know how I was doing with it, and I did find with her, you know but. I find that that helps, especially for somebody that understands what the end when I went to the podiatrist I said the same thing. I said i'm anxious and the girl said Oh, you know. he's very nice and I said no, I understand that, but I suffer from anxiety so it's, not just because i'm going to a new doctor or anything like that it's just I am finding that that helps me that I don't have to hold it in and not express my feelings."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and I. Again, these are such important self discoveries that you're having and you're like hey I know that now, and this is a technique that I can use because again getting your needs met."
13814.0,Patient,"mm hmm because it's not like, how are you doing oh i'm fine. And that's not where i'm at. And I need to be able to be truthful to people and they get to deal with it yeah you know so not me."
705.0,Provider,"Even with how you're describing it it's interesting to have different people will will hear it and different people them will in their own way, try to support you."
13814.0,Patient,"uh huh. yeah though yeah you know that the girl said, this is his way of doing it and that's why I told his supervisor that it probably is laughing, but this is not a laughing matter so."
705.0,Provider,"it's Okay, I can take like your understanding that it could be his Defense mechanism and it's like yes, I understand that, but it doesn't discount how you felt. And the ERA just wanting to educate and and help that in the event someone else has anxiety. that the reaction could be different. yeah absolutely I had someone, the other day to that he started he's taking classes, and so the the anxiety, the level was really high so he just started telling people I haven't society which take a breath with me. And people are really engaging in it and then he has time to set it to you know reset. it's working for him yeah."
13814.0,Patient,"i'm like what. I love in one of in the group thing one of the guys, he was having a heated discussion with this dad and so he goes okay dad, we need to let's take some deep breaths. So he was doing with his father and bringing him back down again and then, when it got a little higher. Then he said Okay, we need to start taking some deep breaths again and that worked for a while. It didn't work for the whole thing but. It helped him stay in control and bringing his father down some so that it didn't get out of control us as quickly they got more discussion in and I thought. Was it using it for. family."
705.0,Provider,yeah I share what the groups to have one of the reasons why I start off group within grounding exercises and just for the group it's also for myself it's like we all benefit from it. It just sets the pace and brings us into the present.
13814.0,Patient,"Yes, so."
705.0,Provider,"Life gets busy, and we can really get into that mode of just letting it all come in it's like wait a minute."
13814.0,Patient,yeah very much so so.
705.0,Provider,"So still you know, looking at different things that you can put you know, as we say, I sometimes to I asked people because they'll call it a little box or tackle box or put in my purse or my satchel, what do you visualize."
13814.0,Patient,"More things in my chest yeah I think that that's you know very much. One of my first therapist that I had many years ago she wanted me to. discuss what was in my chest, and if there was some heavy dark. stuff in there and I said it actually went all the way into my stomach and it was like tar black tar, that was not going away. mm hmm and gradually it got better and with more therapists I don't feel it at all anymore, but it was such a realization when she said let's figure out what's in your you know how are you feeling and I realized, it was so deep and so into ghosts describe it. And it was just black tar that wasn't moving. And that was so interesting to actually see that and to realize now it's gone it's been gone for quite a few years and I check it and go nope still not there and so that's been really good you know and that's why, when we pray sometimes it church will."
705.0,Provider,put our hands over our hearts.
13814.0,Patient,And that's why I think of that too.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, the body usually will tell us before we even go up here it's already in here."
13814.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. So."
705.0,Provider,"Being in tune it's like again it's one of those advanced skills and when you're able to take note like you did, and to even to meet a here that's healing you took what you identified, it was the tar, it was in your stomach it wasn't in the chest area."
13814.0,Patient,"Though it was all the way up through the chest. Okay yeah. And to get rid of all that it was I mean just acknowledging, it was a major step that I hadn't even realized, I was dealing with could it have been there for so long right so yeah it was."
705.0,Provider,and using that same formula is exactly what you're doing when you're sharing with people acknowledging that you have inside it. it's the formula that works for you yeah.
13814.0,Patient,But yeah so that's it done i'm doing well for that and. we'll just sort of have to see.
705.0,Provider,You absolutely i'm you talked a little bit about motivation and when I think of. Having that acknowledgement and having those skills that we can navigate through life is where then we replace that feeling helpless or hopeless becomes hopeful. yeah and having confidence just self confidence.
13814.0,Patient,"I wanted to also make it positive comment. About bright heart health I got a letter from my insurance company saying that what am I. added a precedence, I think, is not covered in the needed to get prior approval, so I called like on a Thursday afternoon or Friday morning something like that to let them know and he said he would let me know as soon as it got approved, and it was Monday early afternoon. If you did that, through a doctor's office, I mean there's actually a department that does that through bright health right heart health and, but it was Monday early more early afternoon I got a text saying it's been approved. So that was really good that I didn't have to wait and it was just taken care of and so that was great, I was glad that it said Oh, we have a department for that, let me just switch you over to it, and so that was good, well."
705.0,Provider,Thank you and that's good feedback to that i'm hearing them that that's one department that seems like that they what what they're doing is working and then acknowledging that yeah That was really important to have it approved and in such a great timely manner.
13814.0,Patient,"Yes, much faster than in a doctor's office. It goes against."
705.0,Provider,"she's up and down up and down yeah well Kathy again, I hope that you know you're taking time to reflect and to know that this was a huge successful mission that you just did. Your House looks beautiful, I see the Nice smile I hear just like you know what I am content, and I am doing this."
13814.0,Patient,"yeah i've just been sitting out on the back porch sometimes with daisy just enjoying being outside and not you know, even if the tv's really loud who cares. Nobody else's hearing it i'm not in an apartment i'm not in a condo which i've been in for last quite a few years. one or the other, and it's like oh finding hearing aids I don't care. I don't, not that I do but."
705.0,Provider,"letting it all so so can, and it is just you know soaking in this moments and and the owl. I love to with the next door reaching out and getting that connection peace with others."
13814.0,Patient,"yeah and i've already met Judith and Dennis from next door next door next door. i've met the woman on the other side once i've met the lady across the street, she diane she came over and her husband RON has an electrician used to come in and glory who own the House, he would change the light bulbs that are real high up. You know so. She said just asked him over she said that lori used to make New England plan chatter for him and so she'd say come over and bring a pot. This is. What I do not cook like that so."
705.0,Provider,just getting that out of the way.
13814.0,Patient,"yeah and they're both happy that i'm i'm a grandma site and not with children, you know. Just to keep the neighborhood quiet, even though grandkids come over, you know that type of thing it's not anything they just like the neighborhood this way."
705.0,Provider,"Again, it goes back to where their comfort zone your comfort zone, and you know it's. Community wise is so important to feel comfortable where you live and to know that there's people out there, if you want to connect but also having time to just be independent and by yourself and soak in that into. You mean that balance life is in balance."
13814.0,Patient,"Sometimes I forget to look at it, I mean to actually."
705.0,Provider,"All good things, and you know CAFE again I am hearing so many I like to just call them wins and. If you get a chance. I don't care if it's a Pasty note, or you just write it on a tablet or you say it out loud, you know here's My big lens. No. I took control of that situation. i'm learning techniques."
13814.0,Patient,"it's interesting because Bethan told me. A couple of weeks ago when I said I finally felt happy and she said mom you say that more often than you think so you need to put it in your. put it in somewhere, so you can go back and look oh it's been that way i've been thinking about that, and I have been so happy there's never been a time that i've been depressed or sad. And I thought that's really a different thing instead of putting down oh it's was to you know, once a week, you know. I don't even have to put them down. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, right. Yes, absolutely. So well it's been awesome i'm so glad that you're settled in and your new place and we're down again for October the 28th at 3pm."
