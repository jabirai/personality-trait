His kids seem to have issues, too, but it goes with the family, I think you know the way he is the way their mother was never in the picture. Unless you want, and let me know that they're older but. wow, so I am very proud of my children. that's proud of all of the night my my nephew works my. niece that's the one who needs to get help right now, but she doesn't think she has a problem, even though she drew all in her apartment. I don't think that's normal."
748.0,Provider,Whatever you do in her apartment.
15792.0,Patient,"You know she drew pictures and. I am love Jesus I don't know but yeah she's I don't know if. She was like my sister, one that passed away that's those kids they're. Always angry short tempered. She just actually lost her kids again after having a. Four years. she's drinking."

748.0,Provider,"Well, if she's of harm to herself or other people that's not a bad idea."
15792.0,Patient,"You know what I think I may because. She was actually driving her vehicle. When she was drunk. And she messed it up in the desert. I don't know it's just you know she's young she's only she's Victor he will be 35 next month. Then, my nephew he has a good job, and you know my my step daughter, she has a good job, my stepson is more distance which i'm afraid of because he's just he reminds me of his dad but young. And that's scary. Because when I think you know my my husband was young younger when I first met him and stuff he was never. You know, he was seemed to be a nice guy. And if he said, you know that he's gonna be like his dad and not talk it's like oh gosh I can't lose something like this yeah yeah.

Three girls and one boy the boy was the fourth one, I believe. yeah he came in number four we have three girls it's my sister me and then my other sister, then my brother and then my little sister she just turned 50 my little sister but me and her clothes and actuality she was diagnosed with bipolar. Back in 1996 okay. that's a long time ago. I recall, when she was younger she go to the doctor with my mom my mom has a history by four. Okay yeah. It was, it was very weird growing up when I recall my mom having episodes like. Like every 10 years I don't know if that makes sense. My mom had my sister. The first of all I we didn't know she was pregnant or at least I didn't know she came home with the hospital with a brand new baby, but she had an episode, where she was doing strange things in the House, I still remember her putting. dishes in the washing machine. it's either she wanted a dishwasher. i'm Sorry, I have to joke about it now or yeah she I remember her, she my dad had a place or a State hospital. And my dad got his sisters and her sister, they would come take care of us at home, and you know, while we went to school we're talking to elementary elementary years. And from what I know my dad I asked my dad question was you know, I was 23 at the time before that I asked them questions about my sister, I guess, our mom. When she was first. When they first got together when they got married I guess she was she was positive, tuberculosis. Okay, so she was actually her sister passed, she was the or so, when my mom got married. And she passed from tuberculosis and my mom ended up having it so she went to a. seminar sanitarium. Is our I don't know where are they they you know they took her people and. At that time, my sister was the only one born and I guess the Foster services, the family took care of her for a while that was the he was new to the United States, and my dad once he became a legal resident, he was sponsored by a person San Diego. Five years later into five years he became an American citizen. So, and you know we all strive for importance of education, so you know we all, we all did good. growing up with I remember being class President in elementary I even spoke in Spanish, did the graduation speech in Spanish. junior high high school came and went."
748.0,Provider,"sounds like you did well, though during those times that you. took school seriously, and it was important to you."
15792.0,Patient,"Well, working 25 plus years. It was an adventure, in itself, and as I got older one part of my body of torn meniscus and my knees, which kind of get slow and. Then, my ankles i'm just a mess, but I still want in my it's like i'm a young at heart, I want to do things that like to do things with my grandchildren, even though i'm still in pain it's like Come on, you can do it.

She says, I should have because she she turned out to be bad I did, and I put her in boot camp when she was 12 years old, through the alley USD, for I believe it was a month. You say no mom i'll be good i'll be the last couple weeks, but that was it."

I think he went up there to get away from him and eventually the brother went. went out that way. I don't know that's good. Terrible relationship between them to. brother and sister. But. You know she. felicia and her man and the little Sebastian are doing good actually they happen to be over when.

15792.0,Patient,"And then days later he tested negative, but then he tried, he did it again and he tested positive oh boy that I hear from him all this negative stuff that it was my fault. When I was thinking, but you, you will you were going up there with the club members and none of you guys wear masks or nothing like that, but it was. whoops sorry sorry either okay um yeah. And we got through that and I had one camera in the living room and I had told his daughter, you know if you guys want to see the camera the weight, you know, so I look at it back because I wonder. Did I say something wrong to where he acted the sweet. You know that's why I have the cameras and his daughter. told him. Because when this happened with us on Labor day. He disconnected all the cameras in he said it was for me to record him that's not the point that that wasn't the reason the cameras are there, first of all, he needed the cameras were there, he put up and there was one set. In the living room. But we basically did for. Security to see these boys running around because we have a bird also. But no, it was just to see you know what I say something wrong to where he reacted this way, but no it's never the reason it's just him. But I think we're up with our session oh."

Isolated was a big part well we communicated here and there, but not not as seem to have gotten worse than better. But that's why I got my Chihuahua and he ended up eventually getting his. German shepherd you know I heard him, he was saying, I don't know what I would do without you and I thought wow that's so nice of him telling me this, he was talking to the dog you're."
748.0,Provider,yeah I think I think that's been true for a lot of people that feeling of having their pets be they're saving grace during the pandemic.
