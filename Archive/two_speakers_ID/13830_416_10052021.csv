ID,Role,Message
13830.0,Patient,Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. hi can you hear me. I can yeah sorry i'm having trouble with my. notes okay.
416.0,Provider,Are you there. keep coming in and out.
13830.0,Patient,It says i'm on a driving mode and I don't know how to turn it off.
416.0,Provider,Oh. Maybe go to. i'm not really sure.
13830.0,Patient,i'm trying to Google it I don't understand one SEC sorry. My settings. grab on now is it still letting my voice go.
416.0,Provider,I can see you you're you're all good. But you can hear me I can hear you and see you yeah. Okay well hi it's nice to meet you.
13830.0,Patient,You too.
416.0,Provider,"So we're scheduled today for our initial session, which is really kind of to get to know us session i'm going to ask a lot of questions. Just to get a better sense of your history and your goals and therapy and that kind of thing. And then. We can talk about what comes next."
13830.0,Patient,"Well, can I just say like i'm not I really. it's hard for me on this platform to open up like I don't want to sound like paranoid or something, but I think there is something weird about it being recorded. It feels I don't. feel comfortable giving all of my. I don't know there's some I feel like there's gonna be a little blockage and can't like put that out of my head that i'm being like recorded for an insurance company to like i've never had therapy like that, where someone could watch it or. yeah either I mean i've looked at, you know I don't feel comfortable with this bright heart that's Nice that they i'm where I can get like my lexapro and i'll have to leave the House and stuff but i've looked it up, and it seems mostly based around like. addiction harm reduction, treatment and i'm not out of place, and like a lot of this is kind of big pharma waiting drug addicts type thing and I just don't I feel a little bit. uncomfortable and then there's something strange about the weight rooms and the people on zoom in their apartment. Like just I just I find the whole thing really creepy. Calling you that, like I don't know how much i'm going to this and I just feel this doesn't really feel like therapy, to me it feels more like an insurance. thing to mark off from like the surveys, like the whole thing very like billionaire was trying to make money off of vulnerable and I. I don't feel comfortable open i'm like I don't mean that against you, I just I don't know how much i'm gonna we can do what we have to do for me. refilling my lexicon stuff but I know how much I feel comfortable opening up about my own through a five part because I feel it been the experience since I feel this is so. This feels like such a money thing to me."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so this might not be the right venue for you, this might not be the right company for you, if. that's if that's what it's feeling like. And the way that this model works, because we're a telehealth. Company, we do need to like have therapy and then you'll be assigned to a group which you'll have to attend. And that's part of that is the requirements of being able to prescribe things over. Tele health. So we if that's not going to feel comfortable for you and."
13830.0,Patient,"that's understandable yeah I guess i'm i'm having i'm considering it i'm thinking about it's just yeah the whole thing just I just was when I was looking it up, it seems like the company is mostly. Based on."
416.0,Provider,"How the company, the company started with. Treating. eating disorders actually then moved and then moved on to. A recovery like then. They just We grew kind of slowly, we started with. eating disorders grew into treating folks with substance use disorder. And then added added a mental health. component after that, and we also treat people with chronic pain. Issues yeah so."
13830.0,Patient,um so.
416.0,Provider,"Online it might seem like we're only a drug use company, but. Like all of my parents are all mental health."
13830.0,Patient,"Patient oh I don't know i'm i'm also just kind of in a bad mood and I just I don't like the I just find it really kind of. Gross to be to be required to be recorded when having therapy and then to be asked about my history and my pain and my and knowing that it could be viewed by some insurance person to like mark down. What Christ, can I did no."
416.0,Provider,it's not viewed outside of our company.
13830.0,Patient,"yeah but still I just feel like it'll be used in some sort of way that I feel cheapens my my truth and my I don't mean that I think you're you. Personally, are doing that I just and i'm i'm not against like a harm reduction and attics getting help for, but what I just I just feel kind of there's there's just something very strange to me about this whole virtual okay there."
416.0,Provider,"But sounds like you would prefer, and we can we'd be happy to give you resources for in person. and clinics and things they work with your insurance that are."
13830.0,Patient,near you yeah.
416.0,Provider,Would you rather.
13830.0,Patient,"No, I mean I can do this today, I just I just telling you that I don't know how open i'm going to be about about everything, knowing that it's recorded. Well, I don't."
416.0,Provider,"know that that's going to work, though right true because we want to like. We want you to I mean we want to be helpful, so if you feel like you can't really engage in a therapeutic relationship overs. Then it's probably not going to be that helpful."
13830.0,Patient,"To you, and. help you need just not a record of recorded zoom just feels strange, you know. I mean, I feel like that it almost contradicts the the. comfort comfortability needed for therapy for therapeutic relationship, you know to be told like. hey this is being recorded and also fill out these surveys saying how much chronic pain, you have like it just feels kind of like Is this a therapeutic relationship, or is this like am I a cog in the machine of like a big pharma thing. You know, like, why not."
416.0,Provider,"But yes, I mean I hear your concerns yeah so um. it's entirely up to you know if you want to."
13830.0,Patient,"But I also don't want to. I also don't want to not get refills on my lexapro I mean I i'm just i'm sort of complaining, but I don't know i'm just trying to be transparent about home ceiling, I mean I don't want you to mark me down is like. refused therapy and don't know, mark you down like that i'm it's okay if we're not a good fit for you."
416.0,Provider,"We want our big interest is getting you the help that you feel like you need so if that means working with the different agency we're happy to provide you referrals to other agencies. it's more important to us that you get the help that you need, and then it feels safe and good to you, and it is for us to get some sort of insurance money for you, believe me, we have plenty of patients."
13830.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So if that's if with most comfortable for you is the is the um you know, a different agency, then that's absolutely fine with all of us."
13830.0,Patient,"I don't know i'm just sort of complaining I just i'm just. What why don't we just do do this today, though, because I i'm just kind of in a bad mood but i'm. We can do what we're going to do, I just. I just sometimes feel sort of. easily taken advantage of or. I don't know. i'm just having a bad day."
416.0,Provider,what's what's been hard about your day.
13830.0,Patient,"I just wake up wake. up the ball and I feel really like i'm in a good man I just walked to the corner store and. The smallest thing like them, the debit card machine for 30 seconds I just start getting free at everybody and everything in the people in my town and it just spirals into anger and I hate I hate being repressed, I want to be loving and. Caring and and I see myself. Nice. and want to be a nice person and and I. going. off."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13830.0,Patient,And it makes me God about myself Oscar.
416.0,Provider,Because the lexapro help with that.
13830.0,Patient,"it's better yeah it's better I mean like because before this I. Was yelling I live with my dad I was yelling at him all the time now i'm more like. Oh, get frustrated him for like 30 seconds and realize it's happening cool off before I would like we. fight for a half an hour, so it does help. Obviously it doesn't fix every. Better."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good I mean i'm glad that it's helping and then you know some of the rest will be some maybe some therapy, have you been in you talked about and therapy, have you been in therapy before."
13830.0,Patient,"I do, I do have another therapist."
416.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, so you wouldn't even need to."
13830.0,Patient,Work on.
416.0,Provider,That I certainly.
13830.0,Patient,have an appointment.
416.0,Provider,yeah you would just need to do so if you are seeing how often are you seeing your outside therapist.
13830.0,Patient,Every two weeks.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so all you would need to do, then, is seeing me once every three months, just to check in and make sure you're doing okay after this. yeah so, then you won't you won't have big deep recorded sessions with me. And then we'll assign you to a group so that you can get you know you can get some group therapy as well and and then you'll just do the MED chickens. Okay, so so yeah that makes it easier than you wouldn't have to do. Like I said, the big sessions with me."
13830.0,Patient,Before I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings or.
416.0,Provider,"Thank you, you didn't I actually really appreciate your honesty and I think your concerns are valid, yes, I mean I worry about big pharma and everything if it makes you feel better i'll tell you this company was started by somebody who is far from rich. He I know him and he is just a regular old guy with a family who. had worked before in substance abuse treatment centers and just saw that a lot of people didn't have access to actually go into Inpatient treatment. And he wanted to be helpful and he is he knew how to design software and that sort of things, so he created this company, so that people, people like in rural areas who don't normally have access to care can get care. And so we have people all over the country who come to us because they will otherwise not get the medication. They need are nowhere near clinics, though."
13830.0,Patient,"You I totally think that's a good thing I just i've been to rehab I went to rehab a few years ago, and like. there's just something about like the juxtaposition between the people there who look at everybody and the insurance people come in and it feels like. weird moment where you remember what's going on and and it I don't think it takes away from the people who do care about you, but it like i've always felt kind of like. Like there was a moment there, I remember with like the nurse would give you your medication, if you are on something else, she would ask me every day, how are you doing drew you know how how's your are you having cravings like I, I wonder how. asked me this and then I realized a week it was writing down, you know looking sharp like if I said, and then you started saying that I could leave now because my insurance ran up because I didn't. exist anymore, you know and then it's. Like. i'm I get kind of hyper vigilant about that you know."
416.0,Provider,Because it.
13830.0,Patient,"Sometimes, like you think that somebody cares but. it's about something else."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I can I can appreciate that. yeah I don't think any anyone particularly loves or trusts insurance companies to be honest it's. yeah they're not. There no one's favorite they're not my favorite to deal with they're not the company's favorite to deal with, and, unfortunately, you know we have to all the time we have to find ways to sort of meet their requirements so people can get care so they kind of have us over a barrel, a little."
13830.0,Patient,"But um. Anyway, yeah, so I do have enough. That, I just have only been twice now from my town, but all over zoom and I still am not sure if I if I. Wanting to continue with her or not, but. I don't i'm supposed to have enough that I get in trouble, but I don't know if it's. advisable to have to have to or she would think that was a bad idea, or if it complicates it or what I mean."
416.0,Provider,"I yeah it would complicate things so for for us if you want to continue seeing her i'll still be your assigned therapist through bright heart. And i'll just sort of be waiting in the wings, knowing that you're getting therapy through her and i'll do like I said i'll check in with you, like every three months, and just to have see just make sure you're still getting what you need. And then, if, but if you ever decided you didn't want to see her and you wanted to see me instead. yeah be available."
13830.0,Patient,"yeah okay. that's that's interesting but i'm okay well well it's knowing that you, knowing that. Meaning that this this is more of a check in."
416.0,Provider,"As well this initial session is still what we would call a bio. psychosocial so i'm still going to you know ask you a little bit which you've already given me some information about your history and who you live with and what your goals are with Brian. And, and then we go, we sort of go from there and then after that it's just check in."
13830.0,Patient,"yeah um well whatever you need to I mean I yeah i'm I live with my dad i'm I wasn't on lexapro I wasn't I was on abilify and pristiq. For like a year like i've been on MED, since I was like 12 starting like Prozac wellbutrin and then to abilify and lexapro and. pristiq and abilify and then I started drinking in 2019 at the end of 2019 all the time and the pandemic started, I was drinking and drinking it with all the pills, and I it just wasn't good, and it was. exacerbating my anxiety a lot, and then I just instead of quitting drinking I got I just cold Turkey off my meds and really got worse and then quit drinking on on my own, which was really hard and. Then and quit smoking and then lot like two months ago I got back on lexapro through through this i'm only on five milligrams like small dose, but it has turned me around. A good amount, even though i'm not. I might not seem great i'm if you would have seen me before it was a lot worse okay."
416.0,Provider,"Well, good for you, for deciding to make a change that felt healthy for you like that's fantastic."
13830.0,Patient,yeah thanks.
416.0,Provider,"yeah that's you know that's hard to do what i'm. So you mentioned your relationship with your dad and how How has it, you said you're not yelling at him as much as it has it gotten a lot better, or is there are there still some struggles there things that you're working on."
13830.0,Patient,"it's better I mean I just it's just kind of this this cycle of. Getting frustrated with him or something that feels so legitimate and like he's being such an asshole have. And then, but anywhere five minutes to five hours later, being like that wasn't fair, why would I talked to him, like that he's he's done so much he he's so patient. Bad about myself, you know, and I don't actually call them and I might be exaggerating a little bit it's more kind of just like I have a tendency to sort of be like. i'm. kind of overexplain through my hurt or annoyed feelings wise somebody did something wrong in actually be kind of sensing sometimes I think. Because i'm pretty good at talking. But and and and make him feel guilty for something that was really looking back kind of a small face he made event, you know. We have I yeah when I when i'm in a bad mood or I have anxiety I get very hyper sensitive to sounds it just is in the kitchen and i'll just get the sound of like. I don't know how to explain, like the pot hitting like a fork it just it feels like a 500 times louder than normal and it just makes me so uncomfortable and and like i'm gonna throw up or or scream or something and sometimes i'll end up taking out. Taking that out on the person who made it about it's not about that."
416.0,Provider,"When you were growing up, did you did you ever have any like. challenges in school or learning disabilities or anything like that."
13830.0,Patient,"Non disabilities know, I was, I was okay in school, I was very shy I I definitely had challenges with just getting graded with some something and crying all over the homework and. Okay, and then getting pissed off, but not like I was the kid who was slapping is I was mostly just like crying and being quiet, you know."
416.0,Provider,"And then. I do, what about friendships did you have a lot of friendships or was that a. challenge for you."
13830.0,Patient,"Like one or two guys a year, we would like be friends have sleep overs and yeah I was pretty good with that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good. And what about siblings do you have any brothers or sisters. I missed your answers I would you."
13830.0,Patient,say I have an older sister.
416.0,Provider,And what's your relationship like with her.
13830.0,Patient,"it's complicated but. I love her she's very different than me he was popular. doesn't even look like she's like blonde and blue eyes, she was a cheerleader she was going to parties I just was kind of more nerdy and. Not popular she's just like an inch an extra room i'm an introvert kind of thing she lives in Colorado now and doesn't always respond to my calls or texts and. Has kind of been like you guys are crazy to like my family i'm not I don't like modesto i'm so glad to be away from everything so it's not a fungus relationship we love we don't hate each other or anything we're very loving to each other, but we don't have much of a relationship."
416.0,Provider,yeah okay. and Your your mom. You said you live with your dad what's what's the story with your mom.
13830.0,Patient,"Well, my mom um. Well, my my parents got divorced, when I was 11 and my dad moved out. And then my mom and my sister and I lived together and but then, when I was like 14 my mom. diagnosed bipolar like had episodes and was hospitalized and like got arrested a few topics I can you remember all the specifics, but she was she was hot 5152 a couple times I think and arrested a couple times and just for like public nuisance stuffs.

416.0,Provider,"cool. And, and so it's it's pretty casual right now huh."
13830.0,Patient,"yeah I don't really like serious committed relationship I just. I either i'm just completely single or if someone is okay with that type of situation i'm willing for that, but not a ton of people are so i'm usually just single. Because I don't really find a need for. romance and committed stuff I just don't like it."
416.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and any do you have any children. No Okay, and then what about when What do you do for a living, how do you support yourself."
13830.0,Patient,"YouTube well before I didn't I mean my my dad would let me live with him for three until like I started making money again when I got back on lexapro start making videos get by making video since I was like 13 making money at it, since I was like 18. But. kind of with my mental health i'm kind of off and on. With it, and sometimes rely on family and stuff and i've had trouble turning it into a consistent thing since i'm my own boss, or whatever with it i'm like right now i'm. I have a video that I want to make, but I made one like a week and a half ago and it's not there's no deadline there's no there's nothing saying that I have to make it by any certain time. I want to put out videos every few weeks because the more the more you put out the more people watch but, and I have like a good. fan base size, like, I have a lot of subscribers and stuff but. it's hard for me to. Discipline myself or figure out. When to like I don't I could make it today, but I could also just watch TV and garden store like and no one would say anything. i've never really figured out how to do that."
416.0,Provider,So a little bit of like struggle with kind of trying to get motivated and that kind of thing.
13830.0,Patient,"yeah we're just not saying well how about next week, but literally nothing would really I mean besides that. I wouldn't make as much money but i'm not super motivated by money as long as I can make enough to live on."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13830.0,Patient,i'm not good at saving. But yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, and then you, you said you've been kind of struggling with your emotions and that. sort of thing for a long time what. Have you ever had any issues with. suicidal ideation or suicide attempt anything like that."
13830.0,Patient,"huh yeah when I was like 13 but. It was like I took my I took all my pills, but then I was like called like went to the hospital I didn't really. Like it wasn't like somebody found me and I was planning, it was kind of like I changed my mind after doing something so technically yeah but I wasn't committed or anything."
416.0,Provider,"Right and then any. Any. Since then, are."
13830.0,Patient,"No, I mean just sometimes i'll feel like I hate my life, I sometimes wish all this would stop but I don't have I want to, and now I want to do blank to kill myself just sort of hopeless feelings."
416.0,Provider,"yeah okay. And then, what about any like physical health issues."
13830.0,Patient,"Well, I I have, I have pretty bad back pain right now i'm. That isn't I mean maybe it's it's not like some people who can't like walk but. or need medication i'm but it's just sometimes it is hard to go for long walks and stuff. i'm trying to figure that out, but, and I have a lot of the stuff that is sort of manifest from stress and anxiety like not completely controlled anxiety issues like acid reflux and indigestion issues um. Those can be pretty pretty intense and I am working to try and figure it out, but it seems like it's mostly based around if I have a calmer day it's better you know."
416.0,Provider,"And then any like legal issues. or anything like nothing. All right, well, what about you mentioned your alcohol intake before it. sounds like have you."
13830.0,Patient,completely stopped drinking yeah.
416.0,Provider,All right.
13830.0,Patient,we're in January.
416.0,Provider,"All right, and what about any other drug use anything."
13830.0,Patient,"No, I mean, I have the prescription for out of and from here, but i've only used it a few times and I maybe I have mixed feelings if I should even have it, but because I used to I used to abuse klonopin and stuff. But I haven't abused I just the few times i've taken it from this prescription, I felt a little bit like I enjoyed it, but I did take it for the reason of like not being able to. sleep or I was freaking out or something, but I ended up feeling a slight euphoria just however way my brain works I just really. respond well to ben's those but I wouldn't say that i'm abusing them because I have like five right now and I haven't taken it for two weeks it's but so anyway that's I just say that because I, I felt a little bit guilty or like. Because I took those a couple times, but it was for. It was for the purpose of calming down and not getting high, but then, when I did it, I felt like oh I forgot how good this feels so, then I feel kind of weird saying like i'm the most sober person on the world. But I don't use weed or anything else or total i'm even drink caffeine anymore, and I quit smoking in June talking cigarettes. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"You put a lot of stuff for your health, I congratulate you that's not easy to do."
13830.0,Patient,"Thanks yeah it was really hard, especially smoking was the hardest one honestly."
416.0,Provider,"Oh yeah gosh young people can quit all kinds of things and then smoking to always, the last thing but everybody quits because it's honestly it's definitely one of the hardest. yeah wow amazing job. So okay. Well that's about it for my questions do you have any questions for me."
13830.0,Patient,"hmm. Now, as long as I hope I didn't answer the question about suicidal thoughts in a way that was reportable or something I don't mean that I thought I am suicidal."
416.0,Provider,"I got I got that loud oh i'm not thinking that you are suicidal. Oh yeah yeah no I think you're pretty clear about that you had some stuff happened when you were 13 you have some suicidal thoughts you changed your. Mind fill and you sometimes you know you get pretty depressed. That you're not go to a cycle yeah I get that. Okay. All right, um any other questions for me."
13830.0,Patient,No i'm again i'm so i'm sorry about before I wasn't trying to be hurtful.
416.0,Provider,"it's Okay, no, I really appreciate your honesty. And I appreciate that you're. That you're clear about your concerns, I think that's a really healthy place to be and. That you have boundaries and that's also a really healthy place to be so. I commend you for speaking up I think some people. So ya know I I don't have any worries about that, and I hope you feel like you can always bring concerns to me, I want to be open to them. And so I will make sure that you. are assigned to a group and also that you are listed as managed by an outside provider. yeah for your therapy and, in fact, you can just let us know cuz. i'm here with you. And then we will see each other once every three months, I will check in in about three months."
13830.0,Patient,And if I was if I didn't use another therapist how often when I see you from my.
416.0,Provider,Insurance the same every two weeks.
13830.0,Patient,But it would have to be recorded.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, we record our session we record them for transcription. Not for another purpose, because so one thing that allows me to actually see patients and be a real therapist instead of spending all my time typing. notes right is. That we record the sessions and they're transcribed so that way I find them and I don't have to spend all."
13830.0,Patient,"My time writing down notes yeah that makes sense I just I get. I just some sometimes distrustful with the Internet in general, like. What if there's a file out there, you know that is need spilling all my darkest secrets, and you know or embarrassing feelings and even if you guys are responsible, with it, when it's like some person walks by you know just like that's what i've mostly get paranoid about yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I can appreciate being cautious. yeah yeah. So yeah I mean it's it's again it's up to you, I want you to have the information to make the decision that's best for you So yes, our sessions would be recorded, they are recorded for transcription purposes. They are, it is. it's a secure recording so it only a couple people have access to it it's not given to your insurance. yeah and. And that's what the purpose of it is, but it is um but. It is what it is so with that information you get to make a decision about what you can do what's right for you okay. Okay, so drew unless you have any other questions I will let you go and then we'll be in touch about a group that you're assigned to and. And then, our next your next session with me in three months."
