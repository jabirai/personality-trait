15284.0,Patient,All this zoom stuff.
748.0,Provider,"So um I just wasn't sure I didn't want to say too much, I had forgotten that that was the same thing it said on Tuesday that Tony. yeah, and so I just didn't want to say too much until I knew for sure it was you."
15284.0,Patient,I will be updating hopefully next month.
748.0,Provider,No worries I will remember.
15284.0,Patient,But I don't want to change the name on my husband's laptop so.
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and so this is your first session so what we do, mostly in the first session is background. And, but we still get started, and there will be ample time for you to ask questions or get into things that feel important to you, but essentially what brought you to write her."
15284.0,Patient,"Okay, so this is called a bps session right, that means background."
748.0,Provider,"and bio psychosocial. Getting it's getting the background. So that as the clinical team, we have a real sense of how we can best support you and what directions would be beneficial for you to to feel healing and support and. progress."
15284.0,Patient,"Okay, so like I mentioned at grew. haha I suffered from depression, for years, I also have severe osteoarthritis. pain. has told me that. my spine is a disaster my husband had emergency surgery, three weeks ago, he has appendix ruptured. and which makes it a little bit more difficult for me as I do all the lifting, especially with our dog you 70 almost 75 pounds."
748.0,Provider,wow.
15284.0,Patient,"14 years so i've been trying to cut back on the whole story is i've been trying to cut back on pain meds I was doing really well just taking one in the morning at these past couple weeks i've finally said I can't do that anymore i'm back to do a day. And i'm hoping, as my husband continues to be able to lift in three to four weeks that I will cut back again. that's."
748.0,Provider,That i'm concerned about the. pain meds that you're taking.
15284.0,Patient,"Is that no i'm not concerned at all, personally, I used to be on a lot stronger pain regime we moved to Costa Rica almost four years ago. and i've taken all kinds of pain medication along the xanax. And coming back to California i'm finding that's not acceptable."
748.0,Provider,No it's not.
15284.0,Patient,"So i'm working with Sean tile and the doctors on that and and they've done a ton of testing blood tests and all kinds of testing. But. When I left it wasn't that big of an issue and i've been doing this for 13 years. So also when. We were in Costa Rica actually a little over three years ago in the states around my son's wedding I contracted cmt Do you know anything about CME. it's called side Omega virus and you probably have the antibodies in your bloodstream because it's part of the herpes family and normally it's a very simple virus, most people have it when their children okay very widespread you can Google sambi it'll tell you all about it. Okay um what happened to me. Is I when I contract it it right after I returned to Costa Rica, I could track it in the US kind of thought it off, and when I got back to Costa Rica, I was tired in August, this was three years ago August. I became extremely ill. And I ran a they hit my intestinal tract. Okay, I was on ivy's every other day I had 140 degree temperature for 10 days. i'm I lost 23 pounds in 21 days. And the clinic we went to which was very good finally said, my cnbc and lymphocytes might know my lymphocytes levels my blood tests are so crazy the doctor said you're going into sepsis and you need to be hospital."
748.0,Provider,"I am not going anywhere I just discovered my computer ISM plugin and I don't want it to die. Oh, so I can hear you."
15284.0,Patient,"Alright, so um they. called the hospital um and I was admitted that night with intestinal sepsis. They ran every test, you can imagine, because we could I couldn't get control of the intestinal tract, no matter what I ate a while I didn't really eat whatever I drank would go right through me. And the hospital, I was at is actually associated with baylor in Texas it's called seem so a lot of Costa Rica has excellent medical care. In fact, that Dr probably saved my life."
748.0,Provider,They do they have phenomenal healthcare.
15284.0,Patient,"So, but then, this was private so you can imagine, so they did the the regime for sepsis and the doctors ran task after task i'd had a CT scan it showed diverticulosis and everything came back negative and, finally, the doctor. Just on a fluke ran a test for csv and it came back positive. And then he told me, I never had it before and. After five days I was released they'd started me on a soft food diet, they give me a specialized diet on and on and on and antivirals for two weeks, I saw GI specialist like that December, because I was still so exhausted chronic fatigue. And he said, you know it usually takes six to eight months, he said it wouldn't be like a lifelong issue shouldn't be based on the virus. But this virus has, over the past three years flared at least eight times, the last time if flared in July we drove back from Costa Rica and we came back because of my health. And just I couldn't handle the climate anymore my temperature doesn't regulate anymore. Especially in the heat and the tropics so. When we were at my daughter's house mid July, the virus hit again. And it has lost it lasted this normal, it would be a seven day flare this one lasted two and a half months. So i'm only recently recovering which leads to a lot of depression, when you have to be inside and near a restroom for by 10 feet and every doctor's appointment i'm doubling up with ammonium and this and that i've seen digestive health specialist now. and And I had the scans I had the endoscopy i've had the colonoscopy here. I saw a GI specialist at digestive health about a week and a half ago in Reno. and Dr Clark who's my primary care here at mammoth hospital is saying it doesn't make sense, because they don't have cm veal sister at the colon there was no CME that they could find they did biopsy after biopsy so now they're thinking. One sets off the other so when the virus flares I have intestinal issues, but they honestly don't know what my intestinal issues start first which flares the virus so they're trying to separate the two. So the digestive health doctor ordered a lot of tests that i've never seen these has me on a lactose free diet. And I pretty much eat what I can tolerate and I have medication for ulcerative colitis whatever that I take daily. And then we're going to see what happens and then next week I see an infectious disease specialist."
748.0,Provider,wow.
15284.0,Patient,to figure out how. it's it's like the doctor for digestive health said it is so rare that this virus flares because it never does with anyone because I haven't had an organ transplant i'm not HIV positive and I don't have hepatitis C. i'm but my immune system is non existent. So. So it's very complicated.
748.0,Provider,With the matter very complicated.
15284.0,Patient,"which adds to the depression, which adds to the pain, which adds to the anxiety which adds to everything."
748.0,Provider,Absolutely.
15284.0,Patient,"And that's why I didn't go into all of this at group because it's just. I never know what's going on and it's a day to day thing I can wake up and feel Okay, or I could wake up and just sleep all day but that's the virus. And they don't know why I saw an infectious disease specialist in Costa Rica in March of 2020 this was right before covered and he felt my virus levels are high, but they're coming down and he felt I should be an Anti viral minutes for three months. To try to control this, but then covert hitch, and that was the end of that, and then we were locked down there for 19 months so. The doctors are all wonderful and I had tried to get into mail they accepted me for GI they did not accept me for infectious disease, which I don't understand. So I think i'm just going to continue going to Reno okay um our daughter lives in Carson city, so it makes it really easy she's 30 minutes from Reno so we can stay with her and."
748.0,Provider,"And when California, are you."
15284.0,Patient,"mammoth lakes. So we're up in the mountains, so our wi fi goes in and out too. But I love it we've owned here since 2003 it's been airbnb and we've just moved in full time so we're trying to get organized between my health and my husband's emergency surgery. And my dog being very ill and. he's 14. So."
748.0,Provider,that's a lot on your plate.
15284.0,Patient,"yeah moving and health and. it's just. And now, all the appointments are just so overwhelming. Because every week it's two to three appointments and I promised my children, I would get all the testing done when I was here and back in the States and i'm doing it, but and I used to be in counseling prior to moving to Costa Rica. And I did see a psychiatrist every month because of the medication the antidepressants and stuff and xanax. And I religiously went to all my appointments. But in Costa Rica."
748.0,Provider,Can I ask what got you started in counseling prior to the onset of the cmt.
15284.0,Patient,"um I was in counseling our son almost died. I mean there's a lot. You can go way back into childhood one thing you said to me, I grew up being judgmental I was raised by john birch Republicans. All right, they moved out when I was 17 because I was no longer accepted i'm not saying I was any perfect teenager because it wasn't. I grew up in the 70s. I mean you can imagine. So I experiment in the Bay area."
748.0,Provider,"In that era So yes, I can imagine."
15284.0,Patient,"The drug era and the experimental era, and all this stuff but I outgrew that. Anything I take now it's fiction. I haven't done that for years. I had a rare a bad first marriage. abusive. And last I met and married right before I turned 20 divorced at 24 and left my husband with him thinking we were going to move to southern California and then he was served with numerous restraining orders. So I could get my daughter my three year old daughter out of the House, because he told me, I can never take her. And I took nasty flights downfalls you know stairs, and I mean it was just it was ugly. My parents, the only reason I think they let me stay with them is because they didn't want my daughter homeless."
748.0,Provider,"So you did stay connected with your parents, even though you love."
15284.0,Patient,"Well, my dad disowned me because I had lived with my ex husband prior to being married. And so, he just on me, but then he said, if you get married like by September, whatever then it'll be okay, so I did, which was a mistake, because I don't think I ever would have gotten married except it wasn't a mistake, because I have my daughter my oldest daughter. And you know i've been disowned for the past 18 years to they I don't they don't acknowledge me. They don't want to acknowledge me."
748.0,Provider,And this is because you see the world differently than they do.
15284.0,Patient,"yeah i'm a democrat and I married a democrat i've been married for almost 40 years and that's completely unacceptable to them. I married an attorney God forbid. Who took care of my oldest daughter Plus we have two children together. and My younger sister, we always called her the the perfect child or the preference child. And I made that remark when too many times and my mother just said, I want nothing more to do with you."
748.0,Provider,did your younger sister take on the same characteristics and belief systems as your parents.
15284.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, but she had her own and she she was she's genius level she's an attorney that she actually lives in put in Vietnam right now. With her husband married late no children i'm the only one really with biological children my older sister has nothing to do with me, I still communicate with my brother, occasionally, but he. became a mormon when he was at cornell so and then married someone who had two children, so my dad never forgave them because the family name will die, which is fine. So, but my brother continues to communicate with them and actually thought my parents would talk to me again I tried to call them from before we went to Costa Rica and my mom did talk to me. asked me about the kids caught up. And then, they said, well, maybe we can have one sometime and she said no, I prefer we leave it as it is."
748.0,Provider,So you've had a lot of trauma.
15284.0,Patient,"And then. So there was that i'm trying to do this kind of like Alvin D, with the you said, like a basic history. yeah when our son who's now 32. Was airlifted out with head trauma a week before Christmas, when he was 15 and a half. And I don't know why he did what we asked, I really don't he he was a my kids all three of them are elite athletes play baseball all the time. And it was you know, the first weekend of the holiday break, we were going to be coming up to mammoth like that week, and he wanted to go out with his friends and go skateboarding. And we said well take your helmet which he did, and he was snowboarding how much, and he went down a hill. And my husband did not want him to go. He was saying no. I. Let him. He rarely gets to be with these friends, because i'm have some fun and be a kid. and It says my Internet connection is unstable so we'll see."
748.0,Provider,How you're going out a little bit. But you're back now so.
15284.0,Patient,"Did you hear what I said, or do you want me to repeat anything."
748.0,Provider,"I heard that you said that your husband didn't want him to go, but you said, let him go out and have fun with this friends."
15284.0,Patient,"And he did and. There was no alcohol or drugs. at all. He just was skateboarding down a hill and a car, but big truck kind of backed out and he jumped to that board to the right and went up in the air and has had came down and hit the concrete curb. And cracked a snowboarding helmet. And did some damage to his back, but I mean it was black and blue from head to toe but they said he would have died instantly at the scene, but for the helmet. So we got the phone call and we drove there and they we got the phone call that they were airlifting him out with head trauma. And that you know they never know where they take somebody. And then, this lady was so nice, because I was I couldn't comprehend anything and our other daughter was there, I mean she and my son are like twins even though they're almost four years apart they're very close and. We were just wrapping presents getting ready for Christmas. So we got to this scene, the lady just kept telling me where they were my son had been unconscious for like 15 minutes one of his friends had life guard training was trying to hold his head stable. And then he sat up and threw his helmet off and try to become battles and his gloves for soaking wet. He had a seizure, a major seizure at the scene, which is friends couldn't deal with. When the paramedics got there they cut off his clothes, which is fine and they handed them to me with his phone and said here's your sense of facts. But then they did, let me write in the helicopter with them. and"
748.0,Provider,My my cable falling out I am so sorry that I promise i'm here. with him.
15284.0,Patient,"And I know they let me go to the helicopter with him and then he was airlifted to linwood trauma Center. And he kept saying what happened, where Am I am I okay typical concussion questions and then he sat up one time and said where's my mom. And they said she's in the back. or she's here, and then we got there, and you know it's, just like the movies, where they meet you land on the roof, and they rushed him in and they did all the testing and. neurosurgeon waiting. That. fortunate. in three areas. And they said he would have died instantly, though, but for the College. And I don't even know if. 10 and a half year old does that, but he did so. He lost at least three weeks of his life we got him home like you know. right before Christmas and his friends would come over. And then he would fall asleep, and he could never remember he could not convert new memory to short term memory, therefore, no long term memory. So, every time he woke up I don't know if you've ever seen the movie 51st dates."
748.0,Provider,I yeah.
15284.0,Patient,"That was my son. couldn't remember thing you fall asleep didn't nothing. took him to the PT you know, took him to the doctor they checked him out again and basically said look his brain is bruised you really don't know how big the bruises. To. come to a. time there was no phone no TV no emails know anything I mean they didn't like you didn't shut the brain down for two weeks because we didn't know. Now that's what they do you know if there's something like that happens you're not allowed to have a phone or watch TV or or do anything you can't be on a computer. But his testing was fine. He didn't have he didn't know that he had some headaches. And he's been kind of angry with me, ever since. So many a lot of anger issues he doesn't remember a lot of his childhood, but he does remember the negative parts of his childhood. he's 32. And he's a mathematical genius he went to trinity University in San Antonio played baseball and Scott, you know with scholarship and was an all American. And then he went to TC you in Fort worth Texas and got his MBA he's passed all CFS. He makes a fortune. But. we're not close I mean our thing was we would go shopping together and he would tell me which coupon to use whether it was 20% off for $50 off he could calculate it in his mind with by the to the nickel. That it's been it's been stressful. I don't think i'll ever get myself for allowing him to go."
748.0,Provider,it's not you. mean we have to let our kids be kids. We have to let our kids two kids.
15284.0,Patient,"I know, but."
748.0,Provider,"I can only imagine, I completely understand that, but. And yet it's not your fault it's not his fault."
15284.0,Patient,No it's not his fault.
748.0,Provider,"it's, not even the trucks fault, even though. A horrible."
15284.0,Patient,"I mean. yeah. So I guess when you mentioned judgmental. yeah lot of judging. I mean it did it affected our entire family, obviously. and My husband is a wonderful man, but he moves forward and he just said he's fine and that's it like we don't discuss it, we just go forward. Which didn't work for me."
748.0,Provider,No. Have you ever said I told you so. or anything like that.
15284.0,Patient,"yeah at the beginning okay um. I think the one positive that came out of it is we do move from Claremont the baseball coach was such a jerk to my son, even though he was, like all cir as a sophomore. And my son had a headache one day, and he called him a crybaby in front of the team. And then my son said he would never play baseball again and he loved it and Lisa do you like to play, and he said yes, he said i'll never play again and we said then we'll move, and we did."
748.0,Provider,With this when he was like 16 or 17 after.
15284.0,Patient,"This, and this is. He has accident was in December, so this was like we moved in June."
748.0,Provider,"He was already playing and he complained and complained of having a headache, in other words the honor what he had been through and stated the truth."
15284.0,Patient,"Right and his math teacher during his finals in January he's his vision got a little blurry and he missed the signs and she said well do that. And so ended up with a B and sort of an A. In geometry or. And then his baseball coach that year, which he played he played that year he was all he was ci. Second team CIO. But he has three balls coming out on one time he has vision blurred and he went for the wrong ball, we had a coach called oh man and just lit into them and call them a big crybaby and on and on yeah. And so, he was gonna quit only said listen don't quit it will get you out of here. The beach my husband, you know what on stuff and my brother in law and his wife had lived in Laguna for a long time, so we were very familiar with like gonna never now in Hawaii but. And we move we just kept everything quiet and we we move set June, and he started playing summer ball and he had the best two years of his high school career his life. He loved I mean it was the best thing for him."
748.0,Provider,"So, so does he Is he able to say why he's angry at you."
15284.0,Patient,"His wife he's married he has been my three years now, his wife is just wonderful. she's a nurse practitioner she works geriatric medicine. So you can imagine they met at ECU when she was a cardiac characters and her father is a retired cardiac surgeon, and she said, my son is just like an onion and she just keeps peeling layers off of him. And she talks to them about the anger, but he doesn't know why and he's really not ready to address it he's very close with my husband and. I mean we had you know fighting and lots of things going on. When they were growing up. Okay, so he does remember negativity in the household. My husband worked like 14 hours a day. And I finally gave it the career and just stayed home and took my kids everywhere, my daughter played with the Olympic development program and soccer she played in Europe, my son traveled all over with baseball my oldest daughter was in drill team and share and thespians and. theater, and I mean. they're all very high achievers and they all do really well but. It was very stressful."
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely, it sounds very stressful and you were really busy."
15284.0,Patient,"very busy, but when we move to Laguna and things started to hit me then I started drinking a lot more to kill pain and numbness and then our dog. died and. I. mean the hospital for two days I checked myself in I just couldn't handle anything anymore and that's when I started my my protocol. And my counselor was with me at the time I just completely filled. When they. opt out my get in home euthanasia is my 15 year old dog. and And then that's when I started seeing the psychiatrist and doing the pain meds and you know getting and doing accounting all the time and not drinking. So I have a drink now it's like very social once or twice a year, maybe nothing. I mean i've been doing for years. Okay years and years and years only I Costa Rica i'd have a drink occasionally with some friends, because that was you know, but even now I don't even want it, because i've been sick. So I have no desire every so often if I was with a girlfriend I might have a glass of wine. Just. But it's I don't consider that an issue either because there's no alcohol in our House. If i'm at a drink i'm going to be out at a restaurant like having dinner with a friend and I don't even usually do that because i'm so terrified i'm gonna just is virus will flare again or whatever."
748.0,Provider,"yeah alcohol is very hard on the digestive system. So, and also not at all wise when you're taking benzema."
15284.0,Patient,"Right, no, I know I mean, and I know it's just I have in the past and but now i'm just like. let's just take care of some other stuff. and alcohol is a depressant yes it is. So. yeah so that's that's that that's kind of a brief."
748.0,Provider,"But a. very thorough and very menu you've walked through a lot, you are certainly somebody who. Has a complicated and painful history, I know you've got lots of beauty in there, too, with three successful children and living in Costa Rica and."
15284.0,Patient,"Well, living in mammoth is always been the place, I would come to you for peace."
748.0,Provider,"And I was going to say and being in the mountains absolutely and a marriage that sounds like it's really been, for the most part, a positive in your life is that accurate."
15284.0,Patient,"um it's been open now my husband is an alcoholic. He was a criminal Defense attorney and he did have a criminal work he did he was death certified. it's very stressful. yeah um and we're both so Taipei is just. He tried to have other businesses established and we bought properties and we did stuff I mean we've had a lot of fun there's no doubt we've traveled we've done stuff. And he doesn't drink either he did have drinks occasionally in Costa Rica, which worried me he did get really drunk one time and I just said, I won't do this again."
748.0,Provider,Oh so he's a sober alcoholic.
15284.0,Patient,"yeah he's not I mean guide to be able to have a beer or two in Costa Rica, at times, but then we just sold our House and Costa Rica, too, so we've been dealing with that. And we went out right before we started the drive back with a realtor and he had too many drinks and then without my knowledge proceeded to drink all night with the one bottle of wine, I had in the House, except the refrigerator for weeks and anything else to get his hands on."
748.0,Provider,Well that's alcoholism when it's in that yeah yeah.
15284.0,Patient,"And I didn't even know it, and we were helping our daughter she just finished buying her house, we were helping her with that it was a stressful. So. um but now he hasn't had anything to drink and he's you know, obviously recovering from his surgery to so. he's doing fine right now so we've had ups and downs, and the kids have been exposed to it there's no doubt yeah."
748.0,Provider,yeah. I mean that so was he drinking a lot when you were growing up. yep and how about you.
15284.0,Patient,"I never drank until really lagoon, and I mean. When they were little, and we would like have them spend the night places and we go out and we would drink together. And that was different. So at that yeah we'd have like champagne brunch for Christmas and different things, but because I was driving them I didn't drink. Okay, I only drink when I didn't have to drive home. Right when we got to Laguna my son had his truck he was 16 we bought it, you know, and I never I didn't have to go to practices and get home at eight nine o'clock at night anymore. And I went to school when they were little so there wasn't a lot of drinking I got my degree when they were young when they were small so. And then the more my husband drinks or less I would drink. Okay, I didn't want it, you know, because we would fight. yeah that's not lesson so. So I really didn't start drinking again until after the accident and when I did not have to drive."
748.0,Provider,yeah that makes sense.
15284.0,Patient,"You know you didn't enjoy those sunsets with the wine, but then one glass turns into two to."
748.0,Provider,321 is too many in 1000 isn't enough for some.
15284.0,Patient,"But I said now I just it's the same thing it's like with medication if it doesn't work I don't want it. And if i'm gonna I won't have a drink if i'm depressed or stressed, or this or that but if it's an easy evening like going out with a girlfriend and having a glass of wine and dinner that's different. But if it's stress I don't want alcohol, just like they had me on a. fentanyl patch for pain and they didn't work and I I just weighed myself up I said this doesn't work I don't like them, it does nothing for me. They had me on the higher dose painkillers then when I take now. You know, and I weaned off of that I just said, if they don't work I need something that actually works for the pain and now the doctor and I are talking about, they just switched my anti inflammatory. will take a lot more anti inflammatories and. same dose of the painkiller nothing added with that, but. i'm gonna email the doctor isilon Costa Rica, she used to give me the steroids shots in my hip i've had the epidural ones in my back, but those worked just as well and I don't even know what it was. So."
748.0,Provider,yeah i'm not familiar enough with the medical side and.
15284.0,Patient,What she injected and.
748.0,Provider,"yeah. I wouldn't be familiar with, but a pain doctor here would be certainly."
15284.0,Patient,"yeah I do see the pain specialists that I saw for for five years before we left, I went back to see. great and so they did all the X rays on my back and my neck and music it's just because it's destroyed your spines destroyed, so no."
748.0,Provider,idea what happened. How that happened.
15284.0,Patient,"Some of it was accidents with my first husband, I had back and neck injuries."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, of course, be going down the stairs, of course."
15284.0,Patient,whip lashes you know jerking this that. And then my mom has severe us osteoarthritis so it's generally awesome okay. just give me a.
748.0,Provider,"lot on your plate, and you have a big plate. So i'm also very fortunate and I tried to remember that, but sometimes it's just like."
15284.0,Patient,"When I was really sick I just was like I just can't do this anymore, I cannot live inside for the rest of my life. Because I never knew, you know the diets that I used to be able to use with the cmt or the colitis or whatever it is no longer work. This you know simple car pastas and potatoes and smoothies just made me sicker than a dog I had pancakes and they made me sick without butter or anything I mean just frozen pancakes sick for two days. Just. But I could eat a steak and I would be fine."
748.0,Provider,Have you eliminated gluten from your guy i'd ever.
15284.0,Patient,um well right now they're doing lactose and they're testing me for celiac.

I mean my parents are still alive I swear to God, my father does not have a heart and that's why he lives because there's no way in hell, he should be alive in his 90s, he was born in 1927. And I mean his brother died of alzheimer's in his 50s so my grandparents and the man is heartless. And my mother I don't think ever really should have had children. She was a career woman she just but at that time we were stay at home mom. And she was more happy with her republican women's and her gifted children's and talking about her perfect children until they weren't so perfect anymore."
