324.0,Provider,"Ah, OK, I know something."
7752.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's actually interesting because, like they cut the side sound like a one so like that i'm pretty sure, but they they left the top row mark, so I still had all this."
324.0,Provider,well.
7752.0,Patient,Thank.
324.0,Provider,You.
7752.0,Patient,"I really pretty good so we talked about like my sleep issues. In group on Tuesday so last night actually. retired around midnight, so I just turned everything off, I went to bed so. Normally i'd still watch something with the opponent later, but I just put everything down one sleep so that was good actually slept for about 12 hours from like midnight to 1130 so i'm like. Oh no I don't know what the timing was, but it was a lot of sleep, which is good, I think. everything's going pretty well I I mentioned this again in group I do need to get back on the gym I can like physically feel my body like not be as well, held together as had been previously. So before like, even if I wasn't going religiously I was still going, you know, once a week or something just kind of hold all together, and I think that, like. With me not going at all for about three months now, that sort of the the cracks are beginning to show you know little more back pain. The more huffing and puffing going up and down the stairs so i'm all for sure, be able to get down there Saturday that was like my goal for the week was the old ones, but. I want to go more often, so I feel better physically."
324.0,Provider,So wait that long. Is your body's way of telling me you really did. I look i'm proud of you and get to bed at midnight that's the big difference.
7752.0,Patient,"is huge yeah I mean it. Was it was between getting like four hours of sleep and. You know the full night's sleep so. long and a real long time, especially I mean usually long it's because i'm like outrageously sick so. yeah, but I just crashed out last night I actually I even took a nap yesterday from like five to seven got up work a little bit longer then went back to bed So yes, I speaking with an APP and a lot of sleep."
324.0,Provider,Any challenges with. Advertising.
7752.0,Patient,"Now, everything is pretty solid um. I should, I I could definitely sandy clear that I do. A lot of traveling to find good foods, but no, no, no issues with upside in either direction you don't know how to make me feel like i'm overeating or except for myself, I really feel like i'm skipping meals or anything."
324.0,Provider,yeah I don't know when the holidays are coming up.
7752.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,yeah.
7752.0,Patient,yeah i'm actually going to watch the friend right here so. i'm definitely taking care of my my food needs.
324.0,Provider,To say the biggest thing and you're aware of it is. How like you're moving.
7752.0,Patient,"largely good. email I think there's always a day here and there were. No more down or subdued or whatnot. You know, part of the issues i've been tired for a lot over the last like say two weeks due to lack of sleep and so that leads me to be sort of more irritable less patient. Maybe if i'm less energetic and it even if i'm not feeling depressed it'll give the impression of being depressed because i'm just like bouncing around the same ways. So. We gathered I think a lot of that's primarily been asleep driven."
324.0,Provider,Are you this morning after. going to bed at 12 o'clock now. How are you feeling overall.
7752.0,Patient,"it's been 10 hours, you can have been 12 because I don't think I went to bed before midnight, and I know that a friend TIM 30 any who i'm yeah i'm feeling i'm feeling pretty good. Still, actually, I think I need to like you know walk around and shake off the rust all that kind of stuff so I didn't like spring out of bed with you know infinite energy, I think I need a stretch in the coffee to. really get my day started."
324.0,Provider,So yeah i'm. gonna ask about that goal. For the week so. You have to. Get that Danny.
7752.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah like the Community appears to be Saturday cuz like to today i'm gonna go do this lunch, can I work till about 11 jim's closed 11 data tomorrow, I have. worked work from like you know ninja 11 ish off and on. But I don't get up early enough to go before that Friday i'm seeing Julie i'm going i'm working on, I have a concert and so Saturday Saturday, is when i'm open, so I can go Saturday morning. which, for me, would mean like noon, but you know. The point is, I get in there."
324.0,Provider,"Well, and the thing to you are aware of. This issue and aware of, because we talked about different tools and. You know I, like you said you you just put the electronic devices down and just. went to sleep, so we know what is the thing, let me know what we need to do. yeah I."

324.0,Provider,Less than midnight.
7752.0,Patient,"I will for sure commit to what I said in group and for the night. is little early usually I was just exhausted yesterday. tonight is I mentioned this previously that there's from even have a snapback effect where if I get a full night's sleep. I often have trouble sleeping the next night. So, like. Going by previous experiences I don't think i'll be tired like ready for bed and for probably a while nail after rechargeable. So. let's go out but i'll still try to. get everything turned off and at least lay in bed and read."
324.0,Provider,"Well, the other thing too. Is it. A little bit your. Body back into. rhythm to yeah and that's what it sounds like say you're up because your body is used to being so records the off. You know so yeah it'll probably take you a couple of days are. Getting the schedule and sticking to it to kind of get this one last thing. Is that they're like you said it affects your mood and you know you're irritable. In Israel. Sure it'll definitely fictional. If you actually want."
