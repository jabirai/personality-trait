Julie said was a low dosage anyways and then she would have it from there and I told her about my headaches and I said, should I cut it in half, she said no go ahead and take the 40 milligrams. But maybe it was because you might not have been eating with it, I can't remember if I ate with it or not, because it's been so long since i've taken it.

12810.0,Patient,I love being in group I really do enjoy this actually.
235.0,Provider,"thought about the two hour thing I sent that to Julian says that's interesting so we're going to talk to our clinical supervisor and maybe we'll see how that that goes, but it would be. yeah we didn't somebody just you do an hour and if you need to split your split and then other women, you know you guys could kind of."
12810.0,Patient,"yeah I stayed over one meeting somebody has left the room open it was me and Crystal and April and i'm not sure who else that we stayed over a meeting. And then Julie, you know so she had to close that out, but it was just Nice, you know just."
235.0,Provider,"You so good, I just really like working with her a lot."
12810.0,Patient,"You know I watched a. movie I think it was Tuesday Monday I don't know someday this week I lay in bed, and I watched a movie and i'm sure you've seen it or heard of it's called four days clean."
235.0,Provider,yeah.
12810.0,Patient,"um. And it's about the girl detoxing and trying to get clean switching get the pivotal shot I think it's probably just. And I wrote some things down and that I had. After I watched a movie I started feeling, you know I went through my emotions as well you know with her while she you know, and some of the issue was detoxing and she gave a speech at a church or at a school. She ran into one of our teachers at a school or school mates or something and they asked her to talk about addiction and one of the things he was talking about is like she just wanted somebody to be proud of her. yeah um and like she just she was still in from her mom and stuff you know, and she just she she was talking about why she started to use and. When the movies ever I was bawling my eyes out and stuff you know and and so anyways long story short, I had wrote some things down, I was feeling that wasn't even 15 minutes later. My my old friend who I used to get I went through that, who is also the mother of my fourth child um my best friend in my husband's child um but um she messaged me and she said you got 30 bucks I can borrow. I said, for what happens when you need $30, for I knew what she wanted. and I she said, for what. and I, and she said, you know, but for. And I said, you know what I haven't i've told you, before the to not texting things like that, please don't if you're going to ask me or talk about things other than just text me at all, because I, you know this, my sobriety and i'm. let's see if I can find it and she said, and so I said. She said, well, I said you're so much better than that heaven and she said. Well i'm just having a bad day I said well you know what read a book or something it helps well whatever and I said I just don't you know i'm having a bad day. I said I needed a friend, I need a friend to sometimes to talk to someone just just to talk to, but um. You know, talking to me about things like that that's just not going to help you and the insight that helped me either. I said they just make your problems bigger your problems that are already problems become bigger problems, but you already know that so i'm not going to preach to you. But I will tell you this, I just wished, I had somebody who had been there, to tell me some of the things I just said to you. just want to use my and made the difference so here I am telling you those things, so I hope it makes the difference, today I said, I just wish somebody would have told me they care, you know so. I care so, but what i'm saying is I am that one person, and I do care if that makes any difference to you. And she never texted me back after that, and so I was kind of in the dumps all day and like you know, I just wanted to know that she was Okay, but. listen to me in from that movie just that one person, where the texting, but I texted her was that have made a difference, could it have made a difference. You know, and I just felt like you know, maybe I am that one person to you today, maybe that will make a difference, maybe I don't know but um that movie really touch I could see it being a trigger to some people, so I went and suggest it to just anybody, but those in recovery. It may be, it makes you kind of feel like you define want to find your purpose to find out what your purpose here."

235.0,Provider,"lot of us, you know you could have just said nothing and just not I can't do it please don't call me again. And I would say hey that's healthy boundaries you don't need that but for you to go out there and mention that to her they you know. I wish I had somebody that said that to me in it, though she's pissed off right the moment I think she'll come back and say wow she really spoke truth into my life and you're going to hear back from her."
12810.0,Patient,"yeah you know, and I don't necessarily know that I want to hear back from her because of the way that I had in the first place, but I just want to know that she's Okay, I just want her. To be okay I don't let me think bad to happen to anybody. Considering the things that I went through i'm raising her child he's my child, but she gave birth."
235.0,Provider,"You there because. In the meantime, please keep please keep safe boundaries for yourself m&t okay your sobriety as opposed support and you get well, you need to rest up and get well i've got to get going i've got a client coming in in two minutes.
