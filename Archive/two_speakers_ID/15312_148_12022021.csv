I do appreciate they share their information privately and in this group, and I also appreciate, you know there's a rule that we had to be respectful and protect each other's privacy. And I wrote for this part is, I feel very safe and and I appreciate people can share their valuable information and privately and I also I don't know if it's. Because of my cases domestic violence yeah. But I think this is somehow. Because we are all, we all need help, so I guess this group it's very good."

148.0,Provider,"Good i'm glad to hear that i'm glad to hear that it's helpful for you um and Francis, what do you think's making you feel nervous and anxious right now."
15312.0,Patient,"Because there's always a lot of in my mind, like the emergency situation and then so many things going on and I knew I know i'm supposed to take care of myself, but I always put dollars people's needs higher than my. My my thing and then, which means, just like overwhelmed by by that I don't you know, like I don't have enough time and then maybe something to do with my time management. And then, also the stressful environment because i've seen it all people around me that are some some also then you know even has difficult or situation and I do so, I always had embassy, and I also just learned. I probably have embassy i've been always had been presented my husband or people who are not nice to me, but I didn't take it, it was unable to identify they are you know, like that I shouldn't have helped helped him firewood second to see i'm someone. And if."
148.0,Provider,You put others before your own mental health.
15312.0,Patient,"yeah and then not just mental health could be either I gotta do something stupid or use credit card and lead a person to use $400 where I don't actually have the income, so I had to be careful about this like synthesizing because I, in this case I can't even afford right. So I, but I think it might be related to my trauma. I went to eat our last two days ago. ago and I thought you was my issue I didn't know I have an issue I went to the doctor to verify situation er doctor for me and see if my roommate because I their time my room, I will share with someone who has a very unique situation. and My doctor and I didn't know I. I was nervous because earlier mentioned about inches and I was, I was not able to identify, but when I went to the er they kept asking me how it's me or my room any help. But I thought he was my issue and I record the conversation we had because he was somehow afterwards I discovered, I was nervous, because my pepper I have hypertension, at a time which was like 148 and so that's why they had to mean admit me and but I was not aware that I was in. Like nervous and or maybe shocked, but I, I was very pretty good I if I feel something funny I wouldn't digitally confusion in my mind. So I will go to the hospital and I went to er and then realizing it was my roommate who has the issue, but I thought he was mine. And I do what's my illusion even I recorded I wasn't sure if the recording has anything but there's something I mean there was the aggressive informal. conversation my roommate to head towards me, but I still have emphasis on her because she drugged edit and then sheets and then I was told later on when I share. Her quite happened with me and her and someone told me it's probably most likely her drug like which draws them to or maybe shorts on something. And there was, I was scared but I I later on learned I should I should have called I will i'll be half of her rather than thinking i'm a problem I have problem I do mean myself. So. So that is something that needs to you say i'm nervous yeah I guess i'm always nervous, but I didn't know. Because I put hours or so, you know Alice needs a psycho priority that over myself yeah."
148.0,Provider,sure that feels overwhelming at times to put everybody else before yourself.
15312.0,Patient,"I don't know yeah I have changed since I was little and I wasn't sure if it's my nature or could be, I also learned, it may be, it may be a coping mechanism. And then, sometimes I say try to think about if this is something I tried to please someone please people, but you know I, or is it because the environment, I feel safe their way to protect me. But I i'm still trying to figure out concise in psycho. yeah because I I don't even have money, I give money to people and I borrow money to help people and. I guess sale care party, something that because i'm nervous I couldn't get since I need to do, because I also know those things for myself it's important, for instance, I had to get. My i'm in a divorce process and I don't have a representation right on on legal on paper because I never responded I don't know how. I have learning disability and my husband was able to push portray me also criminal and sex addict and I missed always man and i'm a mother i'm a very dirty so it's like all everything negative and I don't know how to defend that. So, which. I yeah this will be like the legal stressed out legal so. So, I guess, maybe, the situation has run out in the shelter's a little bit complicated and i'm trying to fit into and, overall, I still have a place to leave so and have food to eat oh so they are not super. Like you know, like a perfect to the sender I wanted, but I. appreciate that."
148.0,Provider,you're really dealing with a lot of stress right now.
15312.0,Patient,"yeah this the medication somehow helped me to relax physiologically I feel so relaxed and somehow maybe I will get my. Because, just so react so relax I do have sleep. So. sleep is in helping. yeah my sleep is okay."
148.0,Provider,"And you're eating and you have a roof over your head, do you feel safe in the shelter."
15312.0,Patient,"And I feel safe for my case manager also notice, I have this tray. And, and she would always reminded me very confused because there is a trigger important my my will be feel confused and she wanted me to discuss with her any action and even sometimes I aren't here sure what I need to take a break for to spend time for myself. yeah overall is very safe, of course, the people around me might be complicated situation, but I had to I had to learn to draw a boundary just like. I was told I probably don't have the ability to recognize it save. yeah. yeah because this is something new, I learned that I recently that I. I I. Maybe I use my turn I spoil your abuser."
148.0,Provider,interesting.
15312.0,Patient,Okay. yeah cuz I have sympathy on them.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so um right now what you're working on just taking time for yourself. Right now you're working your goal is to start taking a little bit more time for yourself taking breaks and timeouts and. Just do things for yourself, is what I heard you say."
15312.0,Patient,So.
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah How does it feel for you to do that.
15312.0,Patient,"we're because i'd be at least the last 20 years or almost all my life. Right, I make money for my husband I to me, I feel like a sacrifice it's a. To me suffice in a good way. So somehow maybe I mean my religion Buddhism Buddhism is always kind and I thought that is like essential. And then maybe I had too much high standard for myself like I had to be ethical person and to be crying but i'm also learning that I had to be very rich and it's not just spiritual reach financially very rich in order for me to do donation. So. I don't know why but speaking, these are the last 20 years every job you know was I. Right, basically, I feel like it's more like a sacrifice because I thought it said I though it's good for good, because intention was good. i'm not."
148.0,Provider,yeah but now it sounds like it's time for you to make a shift and take care of yourself versus everybody around you.
15312.0,Patient,"yeah but I know at least, I have to I some I finally discover my husband is not nice like hurting me and also help her to my children 13 my mom so maybe I don't know if he has an issue, but you will be up to him. To get help by know for my children, I had to I had to help them because they asked doing minor."
148.0,Provider,"And when you say hurting i'm that he's hurting everybody, how is he hurting people around."
15312.0,Patient,"Historically he's not a violent person, but. He always he puts me down and, since more than 20 years ago when I married he would be married 20 years, but in fact it's the reason why I married him. And, and then I my kids also because he Mike my kids are so how we interact so in between my kids will always tease each other or they would count each other. And in a sexual content, because there's how my husband. made me feel I am I, because I was not a virgin when I marry him. And so, somehow that affect sales team. On the dirty I always feel like a majority women because I was not a Virgin. and And the fact that he is also he is it important person so and then, when you have needs and he. said to me is this sex is disgusting to me, and I know in China, if I have urges monthly and you find her to have sexual sin, I feel I. I feel I have a person how I could I, how could I have that kind of thinking value or just biological so that's why I suppress I made myself become a vegetarian I eat less food, so that I don't have the sex urges normal sex urges but I somehow feel their sex it's. You know biologically they say it's a it's like a part of needs, but I think if it's the wrong person or someone I don't feel safe it's it's. it's disgusting and actually leads me to have suicidal thoughts, the last 20 years and I until I started my husband guessing I could somehow emotional angry, so you will use the psycho psychological and emotional technique. yeah Thank you I it's my fault and I actually, I guess, I believe it it's my fault."
148.0,Provider,So you're feeling a lot of guilt.
15312.0,Patient,"Instead of guilt and shame. and It has been training my kids to. use a technique because because Mike is also knows my previous sexual history which somehow heard, I heard my feeling that my kids using that to attack me also they look so innocent and and and I, but I had to learn not to react by it's the hurts my sigler Shan. yeah."
148.0,Provider,So feeling a lot of shame from others.
15312.0,Patient,"yeah I think the most. The most critical part at least I mean this tire couldn't put ours how's the husky so for any brush you off here yeah bless you. Thank you. it's and. Because she's not a violent person because and. My husband was able to pick out some information from her. Yes, best sex experience or maybe being abused by someone or whatever I don't even know those but my husband would describe the information my mouth is close to him that I am. I was my mom has I I got a gene from my mom. I. enjoy being raised and they were just totally all the time, content and then. And each time you bye bye bye biological mean you know, during my. relation and I just feel like i'm. So how. Do I get dirty in the Shin and I know those female was was very mean and not nice but somehow I think I develop. A healthy sex I look. And I know it's not sure, by now, I don't like it, but somehow it's imprinted in my Brenda. So, each time when I biologically when I had the knee I just. actually want to kill myself by punishing my body and and I tried to suppress presence and still keep coming you know, mostly so there's somehow I guess the. Facts me alive and apparently my medication, you know suppress that so I feel I feel safe eddie's I wouldn't make a silly mistake, you know it's just my body needed by the meantime I I just have to somehow learn to deal with my body I exercise more good health. Good I know i'm supposed to know so that my information is private and also, I will learn how to take care of myself."
