982.0,Patient,"Okay, very."
148.0,Provider,Good Thank you. Jason I was gonna ask you today. Satisfaction survey.
982.0,Patient,"Recently, yes."
148.0,Provider,I don't know why i'm not finding it now let me try going to your file.
982.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I did all all three or four of them last week, but as a week for. Okay, but I had the group."
148.0,Provider,Let me check it out here. See. Because I think it flagged me because. It was a low satisfaction was.
982.0,Patient,"The only the only one that I, I remember, now the only one that I don't like is the customer service takes forever sometimes to get through to the care navigators. Sure i'm not the only one said something about it."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so it's really about the virtual clinic."
982.0,Patient,yeah it's nothing to do with you or factor you guys are good. Okay yeah.
148.0,Provider,"um for some reason I thought I saw something else on there, and your comment, I apologize i'm not finding it. something about group was did you put."
982.0,Patient,"That did yes good good one. Excuse me so some people rabbit bramble. You know. And I just feel like. there's people that obviously those folks are going through a tough time. Right and that's why they're doing that. yeah I just feel like sometimes you were Dr pack you could maybe stop them and let everybody else getting there's there you know, myself included, but they need to say, or what they'd like to say, because I know they're just not time."
148.0,Provider,"yeah, of course, and I really appreciate you. Being in that group it's such a big group. So i'm you know, thank you for your patience with that, but that's good feedback for me and for Dr pachter, so I will definitely try and be more mindful of somebody taking up too much time with talking. During the group session."
982.0,Patient,"In the Group, especially when it when we're just supposed to check in right or we were just talking about our meds people like to keep going on and on about. I don't know."
148.0,Provider,"I. guess so it's more during the. The medical check ins that people are taking up too much i'm okay. um yeah and it's you know something we will continue to work on, is to get the check ins shorter, so that we have more time to process um. But yeah like I said it's it's good feedback Thank you it's good to hear that, so we know what to work on to and doesn't it being a group big group such a big groups. Sometimes it's just hard to you know, to get a you know we only have an hour so. yeah I agree, though I agree that cutting down check in time. with Dr pachter would allow more time for processing getting support and giving support to others in the group which is a very part of our group. Very. important part of the group sessions. yeah um Okay, well, I just wanted to review that I don't know why i'm not finding it right now I know as soon as we're done here i'll probably find it but i'm. i'm um I appreciate that feedback. and How are you doing."
982.0,Patient,"i'm okay well i've been working nights and that's really hard on me because i'll leave it I start work at eight o'clock at night and work all night. And it's just a hard shift to do room construction because you're out there in the dark, we have you know, we have some lights, but it's just it kind of makes you feel like a zombie. This is my second week."
148.0,Provider,This is a new schedule for you.
982.0,Patient,"yeah it's just for a little while, but it still is difficult, you know because it puts your body into shock, because now you're up all night and you're sleeping during the day, and I have a hard time sleeping during the day. Even. You know i'll take a like a melatonin."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm.
982.0,Patient,"And then I got blankets over my windows in my room just because to keep it dark in there and it helps but you still feel weird when you wake up, I don't know if you've ever been up all night, for whatever reason."
148.0,Provider,"It is not yeah that is not I always. whenever I hear people saying that they have that kind of schedule, I know it's a tough schedule to happen it really, really, really does to sleep disturb your your sleep routine. And it's important that we're getting all the stages of sleep when we sleep and we typically get the best sleep in between certain hours and it's. I think it's between 11pm and 6am, so we should be sleeping during those hours, so when you're not you're not quite getting the same suite you know, like the rem sleep the deep sleep the light sleep. We go through different stages in our sleep cycle and it's really important to go through all those stages so. Having that having that sleep having that schedule that work schedule and disrupting your sleep routine. yeah that's tough that's tough all around mentally physically that that definitely plays a toll on you um How long do you have to have that work schedule."
982.0,Patient,going for another week.
148.0,Provider,Oh that's not bad.
982.0,Patient,"Okay, and you know, then i'll be on days you know, for a long time for a while. Okay, and then there'll be a nice it's just just temporary, but it still it definitely affects the way, I think, and the way. You know my my appetite I don't have one and i'm saying is it is so you feel I feel kind of a little bit weak, you know, like things that would be easy for me to do or a little more, the more difficult."
148.0,Provider,Right right I.
982.0,Patient,Like asleep and lack of food.
148.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
982.0,Patient,"Not one of those people that can just eat that will have to be hungry, in order to eat."
148.0,Provider,"Well, if you're not hungry, is there any way that you can have a smoothie or some soup or some brought just so you gave me make sure your body's getting the nutrients that you need."
982.0,Patient,A try that yeah good.
148.0,Provider,Okay.
982.0,Patient,That helps but there's nothing like real food right.
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah, we need to get those nutrients so throughout the day and then our body needs um because a combination of. You know, being thrown out of your sleep schedule or your regular sleep routine and then not eating. That will definitely affect us."
982.0,Patient,yeah It makes you busy.
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah like I said mentally physically everything. um how are you feeling in your recovery.
982.0,Patient,"Good that's that's actually i'm glad you asked because that's always been you know i've been clean for quite a while now, and I don't ever forget it, you know and here lately I got I got a cold about a month ago. know about a month and a half ago and I I bought some know spray. Right and I was addicted to ministry just because. You know how I don't know if you know you can get addicted to know spray because it makes your milestones doesn't. It they will not work without them, because they get dependent on the little chemical whatever they put in those spray. So I just say just it's a real it was just a reminder to me the i'm an addict and I don't ever forget it. Right."
148.0,Provider,wow yeah that's a powerful reminder how long were using the nose spray for you.
982.0,Patient,"Know for like a month and a half, and then I realize if you had their stuff and and then there's just some stupid like no spray right like who cares right. But there are go go one by some more bel air just right across the street from my house and now i'm not taking it anymore, but it was just a reminder, even though i'm always aware that i'm an addict I don't ever forget that."
148.0,Provider,"Important it's important not to forget that, because when you do. that's when it usually sneaks back end where you start having thoughts like oh i've been so you know people say this all the time i've been sober 20 years what was one drink and and doing and i'm bleeding them right back to where they started so it's important to remember that. yeah, and I mean how quick were you able to identify it."
982.0,Patient,"Only took me shit when it when it clicked maybe five even five minutes like oh shit you know. yeah you know, because now I won't take anything other than most of boxing nothing."
148.0,Provider,I.
982.0,Patient,"mean every now and then I might have an ibuprofen because I got a bad knee. But. It is just a good reminder, you know it, not that I needed it, but it was good to do you know just like a little shocked I guess we call it."
148.0,Provider,Absolutely good God you're still feeling strong. mm hmm and no no other urges or cravings for anything.
982.0,Patient,"at all. I got to the place in mind when I was, I was gonna kill me right, and so it doesn't it doesn't. I don't know I know i'll never do it, but I just know in my heart, you know, but I don't take that for granted, either."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's huge and how are things going at home, I know any your last group, you were in you said, your wife was in the hospital."
982.0,Patient,"Oh yeah so so yeah she's she was in there, and she actually I had to have her go stay stay with her mom because you know she's got mental health problems and she's not violent or anything she's actually really quiet and subdued but I needed her to leave because. It was hard on our kids we haven't we have a daughter together. And the best decision for the family was to just let her go stay with her mom for a while, then maybe. She needs to get into more therapy and take it like what you are doing now, but she needs a you know pretty intensely."
148.0,Provider,Right brain. has she done therapy in the past or any. program for her mental okay.
982.0,Patient,"Yes, she's. All that stuff."
148.0,Provider,Was it helpful for.
982.0,Patient,"You know I did notice a difference. yeah you know, but she don't she would only do it to appease myself and her mom and and our kid. And I don't know why I mean. The whole family wonders why she won't do it, she just wants to medicate what she does take her medicine correctly."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay.
982.0,Patient,"So what it is she's a schizophrenia she hears the voice. And the voice will control that are like it'll just totally do stupid shit like go buy some paper towels and we don't need any or. You know, take the garbage out in the garbage isn't isn't even have full. voice controller. And for a while there she just lets out like this kind of a scream not ear piercing but just a startling screamed it. I mean i'm a pretty big guy it would scare me, and I can imagine what it's doing to my daughter. And so, because of that I had to ask her you know you're gonna have to go and leave for a while and leave until you can get your head right and get therapy and. So her family is dealing with her right now, which kind of put myself in our kid in shock shock, but just a transition right because i'm a single parent, for the most part."
148.0,Provider,"How are you feeling, how are you doing with that."
982.0,Patient,"Good i'm okay with it. i've been gone so much in the last five years i've gotten used to it. uh huh and. My kid is actually happier now that she's gone, I should say arcade is happier now than Obama God. Because it's just less stress."
148.0,Provider,"At the House yes Okay, are you feeling less stress too."
982.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
148.0,Provider,Okay okay.
982.0,Patient,"I mean a little things that the wife my wife would do is like take their take her to school or do laundry or get groceries is nice, you know somebody have to do, but now i'm doing it, but i'm actually enjoying it because it keeps me busy it's a distraction for me. Right, instead of just sitting here thinking and dwelling you know, on my life. yeah you know I mean considering where it came from is I really can't complain."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah good yeah okay. um well, it sounds like you're taking really good care of yourself through a pretty hard situation there, that you have so. good for you um. Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about today."
982.0,Patient,"No, that was the main thing i'm glad i'm glad I remembered yeah that was that was it about my wife's and this transition and i'm going through with with our kid. that's The other thing about the network is my kids at home by herself."
148.0,Provider,How old is she. she's 1313.
