105.0,Provider,Hello. hi. well. Just need to get a note open for us. To speak if you need anything let's go do it. charger water tissue anything like that.
1421.0,Patient,No we've got everything.
105.0,Provider,Well lovely. Is. I saw your message that you had a good experience in virtual clinic.
1421.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh yeah they've really they've really fixed the whole process it's super fast. And like that's happened last couple times, I think that i've checked in."
105.0,Provider,Like yesterday.
1421.0,Patient,"yeah very exciting. Because when I first started there was that that one girl she ended up she had a baby I can't remember what her name was, but she was really nice and she was the only one that ever checked ever answered the phone you know or the zoom and um and she was always really quick. And then I guess you guys grew a little a lot."
105.0,Provider,we're all all over the country different sites all over the place yeah.
1421.0,Patient,I thought you were just in new Mexico California and maybe Ohio. But it's all over now.
105.0,Provider,"No, I mean I work there's a couple of states that i've had clients transfer to that I wish they well if that's not the problem, the problem is is i'm not licensed there so. yeah but anyway, I don't want to go off on that subject, but it has grown tremendously but i'm so glad, and I will pass it along. To get positive feedback."
1421.0,Patient,"yeah it's a rare occurrence right people are real and they make noise when when they're disappointed. And then I have another question for you i'm going to send this picture to actually Jeremiah from my group, I know he works with he makes jewelry does he work with rocks or um. uh well, you might not know, actually, can I send you this picture and will you send it to him because I i've got all this Turquoise but it's in rocks I don't work with rocks. And I don't know what to do with this, this is from the sound guy that Scott worked with he found real Turquoise out when he was rock home noon. Really and. So yeah and. I just don't know what to tell them to do with it like I don't know if he can even somebody that has the materials can cut it out. But I don't know if there's enough there to do that, or if you should just Polish them or or what and that's the one person that I thought of that might actually know."
105.0,Provider,When. i'll think about what. you're saying how to. Get from point A to Point B i'll take some time think about the clinical indications of that so that.
1421.0,Patient,"That I will okay okay. Well yeah otherwise I could probably go to the jewelry store and. ask them the Santa fe jewelers supply. um but you know i'd rather like I rather like if if it's something he can do, and like can charge somebody for and make money doing I rather that that happened, you know for him, then some random person that I don't know. So i'm going to send this this picture to I think there's some obsidian here too. But i'm not sure. Okay, there you go. it's really cool I mean I wish I knew what to do with it, but. I love collecting rocks too, and this guy is like this guy just loves rock collecting it's very rare to find people like that."
105.0,Provider,"um one thought i'm having right now is i'm. If I knew which group, you are going to next attend."
1421.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
105.0,Provider,A facilitated an environment where. You. Might share in the group setting.
1421.0,Patient,Okay yeah that might be better um well I just attended so.
105.0,Provider,mighty minute then. yeah.
1421.0,Patient,"All right. I just attended this week, so it will be. See 1234 before the 25th of October. I saw him in my neighborhood you know. There was, like some kind of car thing going on. Jeremiah and I, and I was driving to my neighbor and you know I live in a really kind of like what you've been here right regular neighborhood like but you don't really see people around town usually especially i've never seen anybody from break. And I was just driving out and there was like this whole line of cars lined up to do a parade or a car show or some I have no idea what it was, and he was standing right there on my quarter i'm like hi that's where. He recognized me it was funny. So scott's asleep in the other room right now I went in I turned the fan, and so he couldn't hear me. Because he's working really late and i'm he's working on chuka like chupacabra. it's a. Do you know about chupacabra. never heard of it till I moved to new Mexico."
105.0,Provider,"Well, I know it from somewhere else but it's from a kid's cartoon."
1421.0,Patient,"safely Okay, yes. Is that why not, maybe well they're doing it's all kids in this movie that they're doing. And um. I wonder if it's a take on that the kids cartoon that would be funny. Anyway, it's all kids and so he's shooting in estancia new Mexico mostly and so he's been staying in albuquerque but the past week and a half they've been shooting at a ranch that's really close to here so he's coming home. And i'm you know we're getting ready to move we don't have a place yet, but we're starting to pack. I offered Maria 2200 to stay here. And she couldn't accept it because the House is a burden on her and she needs to sell it. I mean her about her mortgages it's too bad because I know that at one point she had wanted to keep it. um, but I think her financial situation is just become. You know too difficult."
105.0,Provider,"which you buy that house, would you buy that one good."
1421.0,Patient,"I would not because i'm. Because of the termites that we found two summers ago and and I found some mud tubes in teens room like on the ground, so I know that, even though they poisoned our House and they injected all this poison all the way around it, that they're still here."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
1421.0,Patient,"And there's been a lot of lead see this beautiful with ceiling behind me. Water damage. All over it, because. her family is the kind that that um they would have a leak, and they would just let it go until it was like really, really bad so there's all this water damage and i'm sure there's mold up there. And my expert opinion. In my expert opinion Scott is the only one affected by the mold like the rest of us are. um you know. i'm not an expert, though, to be honest, so but but there's so much water damage on the ceiling that um. I think that just says something you know when the when the last girl the girl that lived here before us has. maria's mom lived here for many years after her dad died and Maria came over and discovered that she was in a bad situation like there were mice everywhere. She was living in the back of the House in only two rooms, she didn't even come into this room and so Maria moved her out moved her into. a place where. She could stay with her like in our own separate area they moved to their Canyon roadhouse To be honest, which is you know, like super fancy. But they bought it a long, long time ago, so it's not like they're super rich, they just they just bought a million years ago and um. So the girl that lived here right afterwards wasn't paying her name was penny or Peggy penny, and she wasn't paying. Very much rent like Maria charges like 800 or something to stay here, and so, then when we came along and said we're going to pay. You know our landlord the recommended us, they were friends Maria and my landlord and i'm so we were like to move in in July and and that's what it said she was going to leave she had her own house that was being built, and anyway, the penny my whole point was penny. I guess it winter happen, and then the snow melted and then she called me and said, you need to come over here, and this whole room was raining. And all over the wood floor all all you know just damage everywhere and all over the blinds which I finally took down after five years. They had water damage all over them and i'm. So there was that and then Maria is also talked about a leak that was happening above the so you know, like when we first moved in there was paint peeling like bubbles on the wall in the hallway, so I think. And then and it's still leaks, she got it fixed she she went and she got a quote from fix my roof, and it was $30,000 and she didn't want to pay that. um I don't blame her that's a lot, but then she went with the guy that patched everything for $5,000 but he didn't patch everything it's still leaks and i've been telling her about this for. Literally six months, and she just doesn't she doesn't call them i'm like what I don't understand like you paid for you paid to have it done like, why not make him do it right. I don't unless you didn't pay on which is possible. I don't know. So so anyway, I wouldn't want to buy you know, and she also wants more than 460,000 because the House two doors down went for for 60 and she's like Oh, we want way more than that. So I wouldn't pay that much for a House that I know has trouble, plus the living room was half carpet have what which is really got up. And she's just gonna carpet over the wood, because the guy gave her an $8,000 quote to do the living. So redo the wood in the living room. But houses are going for that much here it's crazy there's a preschool across the street that i'm actually going to find the owner and i'm going to ask them if they want renters while they're trying to sell. Because you know you got to cover all your bases on it's not even complete inside it looks like a preschool does not look like a House there are no bedrooms the toilets are small they're tiny, tiny people toilets and they're selling it for 650 or 660. it's 2000 square feet. So I know that we could afford that because i've looked it up and that's about what we're going to end up paying in rent you know 2600 2500. um but we don't have a down payment and. Scott just bought as equipment, we had a plan we wanted him to pay as equipment off first and then do that and then buy a house. i'm fine going with a different plan. But. he's gonna be making like double what he makes now, so I think will qualify for a much nicer house. Once that actually comes to fruition he's getting paid right now he's splitting it was funny. So it's it's like you know $2,000 a week, as opposed to 4000. i'm so excited he did that it's very exciting I don't, mind you know i'm trying to keep positive positive vibe that we always find a house and we will find something, because we always do. i've been listening to a lot of. Law of attraction. website or podcasts. To keep my mind positive. Because I really, really, really want to go to that oh my God there's nothing out there, you know that every house that's decent is 20 $900. But i'm i'm really. just trying not to say that at all. it's it's a little nerve wracking and i've been through this many times and I I you know I stopped looking before we found anything, because I was just so discouraged. And because Maria to seem to not need to sell right that you know, like she just kept putting it off and putting it off, and we had the miscommunication that she I thought she wanted us to stay well, it was on the market. And she doesn't she wants us to leave so she can renovate. But she didn't tell me that so i've just been waiting for her to put it on the market, you know till I went till I even looked and um she was waiting for us to leave before she put it on the market. Communication is essential. She said she had planned on talking to me about that and then her mom died and and i'm like oh Okay, because I did ask. What do you, what do you, what do you envision for this like do you want us to leave first so she's you know she's been flexible she's been cool but she wants to she wants to have it on the market by November. And i'm that means renovating you know that means we need to go like ASAP. And i'm sorry but I am like there are you know ads their ads and I. feel like I email, a lot of them, you have to email you can't call did I email immediately, and then they don't ever call me back. I think three people have called me back out of all of them that i've sent something like 20 and one woman told me we didn't make enough to live in our House. So I wanted something that made 200,000. And it might well. it's just shy of that like it's. If you include my money, I guess it probably would be but it's very unpredictable and we can't guarantee that in last year he didn't make that so. She um she just said i'm talking to you as a mother like like like i'm your mother and i'm telling you that that would be too hard for you guys, you should not take my house. i'm like Scott, do you want me to do you want me to get back to her and like. convince her because I found a Co op that would cover the that would make the gas like. Half of what she said it was and and I can show how we will be making. Like way more than that. But in the future, you know, like a few months from now, several months from now, I should say. And i'm so I say I might be able to convince her and he's like no because I don't want to come into something that is 2500 with a $500 propane bill I just don't i'm like I understand that's smart. But, but it seems like it's a really good house yeah I don't even know because she wouldn't Let us come look at it. yeah she wouldn't even Let us come look at it, she interviewed me and decided we didn't make enough money to even come look at her house so. Of course, that may both Scott and I like what. least let us say no, I mean. we've been doing this long enough that we know what we can afford we afford it private school for the past two years, so. We would be okay. We don't have that bill right now. But Scott and Scott said no hell no i'm not signing up for a place with a $500 bill. At least at least he is a green was me that we can search for houses that are up to 2500 because when we first started this he's like I don't want to pay more than 2000. and I understand that, but once you start looking you realize that there's not anything. worthwhile for that. I mean. I don't want to go backwards, like, I feel like we have always we progressively. Since we last New York and we lived in ypsilanti you know, like in our tiny apartment um. And then we moved out here like I feel like our houses have gotten progressively nicer. and To go to go backwards, even if it's to save money to buy a house just doesn't. It says a lot to me, and I think, maybe to him too, but a lot more to me like. it's kind of dumb because one of those friends like three of them live in a two bedroom apartment and they're fine with it so. it's just how you look at it, I guess. To be honest, i'm afraid i'm afraid that i'm afraid."
105.0,Provider,it's doing things to manage that fear.
1421.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,How much how much how often does that break through. Your management skills.
1421.0,Patient,i'm. Like every time I think about it.
105.0,Provider,And what parts get activated to try and prevent you from getting overwhelmed from that.
1421.0,Patient,"um. Well, I think. I think I catch it in my head like you know that, oh no don't don't don't don't think that because the universe will know what you're thinking. And then you won't find it. But I don't see that it anybody else because to you know, because they will think i'm crazy Scott was like i'm crazy."
105.0,Provider,"But I get what you're doing I get it, and so the question to me so that is actually the Managing partner. And what i'm asking is have there been parts that have come up because that isn't working."
1421.0,Patient,"huh. Oh Oh, do you mean like like the part of me that wants to us to make it go away or drink to me tonight if."
105.0,Provider,The firefighters.
1421.0,Patient,"Are they yeah I don't think so I I don't think so. Okay, all right, no I know not I mean that's not even something that I that occurs to me anymore and and I think in the past, like i've gone to drinking instead and I haven't been. Drinking at all actually. So I. wanted to maintain like because it doesn't make me feel good at all, I feel really lucky when I drink."
105.0,Provider,"Well, it doesn't help you find a house does it."
1421.0,Patient,"No, it doesn't it does not. At all right."
105.0,Provider,i'm proud of you.
1421.0,Patient,"I didn't ask my neighbor to i'm neighbors with john Barker. he's like and he manages all the leasing for their family their family john Barker Barker real estate is like a big. A big. Real Estate company here. But he would have places for rent or lease. keep forgetting to ask him. Oh, and also also I signed up yesterday for home wise, which is, do you know about them. They they have they have classes on financial fitness and buying a house and then they also like for foot for people that have never bought a House before that have no idea how it works and are scared about that you know, the whole thing just. Like I feel like I should know this, by now, but but there's my eyes and, like our friends did it and they ended up buying a house you just have to take their class and then they will give you a loan. If both of you take their class like that's a requirement for getting one of their loans um. But it's six it used to be that you'd have to go for a full day and take the class it might have even been two days and I signed up for it before the pandemic. And then Scott ended up having to work, so I had to like. I had to cancel last minute and I rescheduled for later, and when I I rescheduled for during the pandemic like I didn't realize, you know that the pandemic was going to happen so. Now they have it all online and you could take it is six six different classes and both people have to take it so Scott, would have to take it, and I have to take it and they give loans for houses with as little as 2% down. that's great I mean like I feel like we could swing that. You know if we had to I don't know if I can do that in the timeline that we have but, but for the future anyway it's good it's just great. So I feel like that is really managing it's managing it's like moving forward and doing all these different things because Scott can't manage he can't do he can't do anything. Except Google a few houses and send them to me he sent the same one to me like five times i'm like I have an appointment with them on October 29 but it's October 29 like that's way too late, we can't wait that long will you please quit sending me the real whole House. I know it looks fabulous I know it looks fabulous but it's it's October 29 is the first time, we can get in there, so it's not fabulous. It might turn out to be fabulous you know who knows. But. Just house right down the street that was on there, but then you don't know like you don't know what ones are scams and there's a lot of scammers on craigslist these days. And people that are just putting you know fake ads up there to get your information, and I don't know what they do with your information, I don't know what information they're trying to get. it's just it's a little scary and I don't like having to be I don't like really having to not trust everybody. I talked to a woman on the phone for an hour about her house into suki and i'm and I had an appointment scheduled for last Thursday. And then she said her car was in the shop so she couldn't do it in this week, she can't do it because the man's the tenants wife just came back to town from Miami. And like oh my gosh she sounds so suspicious, but I talked to her for an hour and she was like she knew one of lola's teachers like she she had a daughter that went to school at Carlos Gilbert so. I really and she was an older lady like I just felt like I really trusted her and. sucks scott's like i'm not living in to suki. Oh, excuse me i'm not paying 20 $700 for houses to suki. You never know it might be great we have no idea and actually you know some chickens friends live very close to suki that's why I even considered it. Does preschool sale it's it's up for 650,000 and it doesn't have walls it doesn't have bedroom walls like I. I like that kind of thing like I like the idea of being able to just design my whole House. But it seems like you should get a discount for. That. Like you should not have to pay the full price for a house that's not. that's not a house. it's whatever the market will bear it's what they will charge. We opened up a separate bank account to put to put the business money in. Because Scott left it he left his dad's money in our regular account, and it was spent and I don't even know what it was spend time, but of course it's my fault, it was like two it was $2,000 that he had leftover. And i'm after he bought everything you needed to buy. and uh. You know I am doing my thing, where I take out my certain amount of money per week and I occasionally. go into the bank account for things that aren't included in that. But I don't i'm not spending like I was like I was really like out of control and."
105.0,Provider,"i'm curious, how do you not know look at a statement, how do you not know how God spent that's what's confusing."
1421.0,Patient,"um and because I did look I looked at the I looked at the. Well, I do know. We weren't paying attention because he was bringing in so much money and and there was that extra money, and then we got our taxes back like a refund and we didn't get our regular our our. Tax thing that i've been waiting for that I did two years ago and i've been waiting for the check for a year and a half now. That guy sucks but um but we got another deposit into our bank account, and so there was just money in there, we just weren't paying attention. And he yes, I looked at the account right after and it looked to me like there was a time when Scott wasn't didn't bring money in, so we were still spending as if there was money coming in and we use, you know that money to pay rent or you know, one of those standard. Standard fees that you have that come up every month I haven't really examined it because i'm. I should, though, like, I should just print it all out, and I should just sit with it and look at it, because in scott's mind, it was my fault in my mind it's not my fault it's just circumstances and so he's got this resentment. And he keeps bringing it out. and yeah if I think if if we had a clear understanding of what happened we. That we both agreed on that would be really good like for. For our relationship and for him to stop blaming me unless it really is my fault it's possible I guess. And then I can just take responsibility and apologize, and then maybe he'll stop going on and on about it, you know this is like months ago. So we opened up a separate bank account, and that is like really good I mean it's it's like what we should have done, to be unless we should have had a pink and just because he procrastinate say I just insisted I insisted on doing it. And he wanted to put it off another week i'm like why I don't understand like because fernie was collecting the money in fernie was supposed to split it with Scott. So he had all that problem getting paid by Adam all sorts of trouble over the years and, like in fernie is bringing money in right now that is supposed to be split by between you two. And because you don't have a separate bank account, you are preventing him from pain like how dumb is that, like it's just dumb and and. You get really offended because I said it was dumb and i'm I guess I. I cannot understand why why like why you would think that this is okay it's just he's like, why do you want to spend it and i'm like I. don't want to spend it, but I want to make sure you get paid like twice for any is talked about bringing about spending money just from the business bank. And you guys don't have a business bank account together so rather than getting all upset about that happening, why not just allow him to pay you. What do you like, why not just allow that to happen, so he. I guess agreed and then, and then it wasn't like happening, even after he had the bank account and i'm like, why is it taking so long. he's like Why would you spend it and, like it has nothing to do with me spending, it has to do with you, collecting the money that he owes you that that you guys have agreed on, you know just. kind of sense to me and not allowing yourself to get screwed like you were with Adam. You learned a valuable lesson with Adam like. I thought, anyway, maybe it was just me who learned that so. So now for any has had to pay, you know 20 $500 every day for. up because that's the maximum that he can wire so it's been every day for like. Seven days something. And like, and you know you're really like you're really adamant about paying your dad you told your dad like three weeks ago that you're going to pay him next week and you're still waiting for the money to appear in your bank account to start paying them like. If you want to be impeccable with your word, this time. Which is what he said, like that's why he's not paying for any first that's why he's paying his dad first was why he's doing the dumb business move. To pay his dad first and then to pay for me and then two separate from fernie when it would be much smarter to pay for any first get that out of the way, separate from fernie and pay your dad with the money that you're making when you're making the full amount. Obviously he's like but I told my dad I was going to pay him right away, and so I have to do that and and I have to do it because i've never done it before and i'm like yes, yes, you do. But you did tell him that you were going to start paying them two weeks ago, and you still haven't paid him so like you just want to be like half impeccable with your word, you want to like make sure you've got the I. there's all sorts of things going on here and i'm not really quite sure. your husband."
105.0,Provider,doesn't understand his relationship with money either this is pervasive.
1421.0,Patient,It is right. In his mind it's like I.
105.0,Provider,"wanted to know I got to see it firsthand. Oh yeah he. He knows on some level that he gets to offload on you, but you guys don't don't really look at that closely, very often, but he has a relationship with money that is unexamined not in a thorough meaningful way, so you keep coming at it like logic like. It could be some deep deep thing like if I paid him back then i'm an adult and what comes up for him for that well, then he gets to be. procrastinating and I don't have to pay him back. We don't know but. It very worthy of examination, everyone needs to look at that one it's an important it's it's a. can be a language of love and family so. it's unexamined so it's going to keep coming up, they look like logic to you so."
1421.0,Patient,"Just craziness to me and and his dad is like really, really good with money really i'm. Really cheap like. In. Like, to the point that we're Dr Scott crazy, but you know he's got a lot of it now because because he's been. he's been smart he retired early and he's been smart he bought property and he won't spend you know full price on anything and his mom is exactly the opposite his mom is like 10 times worse than me. Which is spending Willy nilly and um, so I think there's all sorts of. weird stuff that. Because both Scott and Jody grew up with their mom you know their dad wasn't around. And there's a little resentment about like that they got their moms. They got their moms habits, when it comes to money and and their dad didn't teach them anything you know and then. he's always been that like he's always been there, to give them money when. When they've asked, but I think that there's you know that guilt of never paying him back when you say you're going to do something, and you don't do it, it makes you feel like shit like so."
105.0,Provider,"Well, my fantasy is this. I wish that his father would step in and teach him what he never did in a direct meaningful way, and you can stop blaming you as he. Perhaps never got a chance to blame this on mother. But again unexamined."
1421.0,Patient,"Yes, and I think it might be. You know his dad's really having memory trouble. um. I think it might be too late for that."
105.0,Provider,ouch.
1421.0,Patient,"he's very he's very and I think Scott and Jody at both in denial about that, I think. um I see him on zoom and he was a guy that shit together always like he knew he was on top of everything knew what was going on he's clueless like it's so sad. And it's been going on for a long time and they went out there, you know, last year during the pandemic to kind of get a feel for it because K his girlfriend had been raising the alarm for years. and taking them, you know he'd been going to the doctor and the doctor said there was nothing wrong with them well the doctor finally when he couldn't name the President. i'm. Finally, put them on some medication I don't know if he has a diagnosis, you know I it's all very mysterious and then God and Scott think this is normal for an eight year old and i'm like. it's not i've been around eight year olds my parents are 77 it's not normal like is absolutely not normal and and the decline the speed of the decline is not normal. And both of them believe it is and believe that he's fine he's not as bad as K makes it sound he's God, actually, so I said because Scott said. K wants to go back to Michigan to be near her daughter his dad doesn't want to go and he talked about coming out here. And scott's like he can't he can't move in to our House, but he probably needs to um he's like, but I would never put you through that because of how he is he just would probably say rude things all the time, you know and not realize they were rude. And you know, asked me to in case and taking care of them forever, so you would expect me to cook florham and, like all that shit that screw that and i'm. So i'm like Okay, but like when is this happening, like maybe we should get a casino, maybe we need to place it has a casino. And um. And then God just said, I think it's years from now, that this is happening and i'm like. You don't even understand your dad's not going to be around for years, like when stuff like this happens it's a quick decline and then he's in he has to go into care like Why do I know this and they don't know this. Maybe i'm exaggerating maybe i'm i'm worst case scenario scenario one it. Maybe I think it's worse than it does. yeah so they saw it, they said oh don't worry and i'm like i've been waiting for you to talk to your dad and find out what the plan was because K is going to go to Michigan. he's going to come out here he's like wait it's not for sure, and it might not happen right now um you know it might not happen within six months, it might be later and then jodi's they all know it's going to be yours, I it's gonna be years before they're ready to leave and i'm like. You really, really, really don't understand, and you know she's drunk so. And she asked me the other night she asked me if I did, if I recorded her. I said nope wasn't me. Because it. But apparently the complaint was against her and able she told me that too and i'm that the woman told able, it was about the pool and about the trip to Dallas. The woman she didn't tell God anything but she told able."
105.0,Provider,How you doing around all this.
1421.0,Patient,"i'm just mad that i'm even put in this position, you know, like that, not that you put me there or that anybody put me there, but she is doing that shit. That i'm aware of, and that i'm. That I even have to be involved in any of it, you know, like. And i'm also grateful to get to see. How. people think when they're using because I was the exact same way, ready to blame every single person around me for the troubles that I caused myself and it's so ugly. it's just so gross and um. And it's sad like why isn't she getting help but. told her if I was going to report, or it would have been back when she blacked out and drove the kids and and then like showed up. Like left the House to go get a baby bag over at her mom's house and then called me from the grocery store crying because she couldn't remember why she was at the grocery store. I was like you weren't going to the grocery store you were going to your mom's House and you just drop the kids off like she was that, out of it, and she just dropped the kids off here and I like that's when I would have done it if I going to do. And she doesn't remember it, you know she's got no. memory of it she's like I don't know when it is that I would have jumped drive i'm not you know i'm not even i'm not even going anywhere, the kids I take them to the bus stop and. I just don't know what this is all about like why somebody would even report it because it's not like I go anywhere. Or you do actually do go somewhere. And she's like an able able when drunk drive you know you wouldn't drink and drive because he's already had three duis if he gets caught again he goes to jail. i'm like okay. And and and I know that they told that woman then made up all these reasons why they didn't do this and didn't do that and I don't know how they believe you know they probably don't believe people that. I don't know, do you say I mean like. Of course they're going to say no, I didn't do it of course they're gonna say that and there's no way that anybody can prove they did you know, like in. At that office. April has driven drunk to Texas multiple times so it's not too surprising that he would. He would drink and he's he's like well, I think it would be kind of a crazy thing somebody would be pretty messed up to try and do that Dr after drinking and like. Evil like, as I know you I know you. I know that you do shots in the morning for breakfast so. Because you don't have it in your lap doesn't mean you didn't do it. But that makes me mad like that makes me mad that they they came up with all those excuses and reasons why they hadn't done this and that she told me about them. It makes me mad that. The idea of. The person may be believing them makes me angry. Whenever I went to. The Renaissance festival and to. I can't remember she came over for some other reason like with Jody two weeks ago and then this past weekend i'm. They came over for teens birthday and it, but you have to go in five minutes, it was good um I freaked out because gage was running around here without a mask on inside the House. And I just had made the assumption that we were all on the same page that we all knew that the rules have changed, you know that we couldn't be casual. anymore they've gone back to being a scary time and my I assume Scott was on that page, but he wasn't kidding it's like he didn't get the same information I got. And um and God she's just she had no idea, she didn't even make him have a mask on like I asked him five times to put his mask on or go outside and. Finally, he listened to me, and he went outside and he pounded and God came out to ask him what was wrong he's like and send us mean to me. She told me it to wear a mask or day outside and and I could hear God talking to her and i'm like I lost it i'm like all I did was ask him to put on a fucking mask. or go outside and you know it shouldn't have swearing at the little kids like that's not cool, but I was like just at the end of my rope i'm like Why is nobody listening to me it's important to get the hell out of my house you're not going to put a mask. And um. So I left the House and I might I drove around you know to like calm down and. Can I try and get some perspective and I came to the conclusion that we just didn't have the same information and and and I came back and I apologized and. Jody also apologized you know, for not understanding that things were different now you know and not making games put a mask on and why didn't I say God, make sure he puts a mask on. Because he's nine I thought I could ask him to do it. Everybody says they want you to treat games like he's normal Well that is treating him like he's normal as asking him to put a mask on you know not going to his mom for every single little thing you can't pick and choose what you want me to be normal about like style or. So anyway, I think it worked out fine she admitted to being defensive i'm I apologize for swearing explained that I was not swearing at gage I was wearing at the situation, because I was very frustrated and it was fine. And then Scott and I talked afterwards, you know that that we need to this is how we need to handle this and i'm. And I reached out Sally who gave me the information that scared me before you know about wearing masks and more mass outside of it's this guy that's got. I don't know he somehow involved in all of this and he's been analyzing stuff from overseas so everything comes there first and then it comes here. So they've got better information, like a head of the CDC so Sally is getting me their information, so I can send it to Scott and and i'm Jody so that they're up on it and. yeah it's fine."
