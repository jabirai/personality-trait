120.0,Provider,"cool good so it's something that you, you want and it's not just that people around you are telling you, you need to stop this."
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Because, then that just kind of a combination of things you know but."
15542.0,Patient,Now i'm.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, but tell me about your behaviors what kind of eating disorder you struggle with and what some of the behaviors are around it."
15542.0,Patient,"So initially it started. a long, long time ago, before I even noticed it was a lot of compulsive exercising. Okay i'm over exercising and then it moved into more purging type being us which sort of lead into some restriction."
120.0,Provider,"purging through vomiting them. yeah okay. Okay, so shortly before going to ERC work tell me like what an average kind of week would look like."
15542.0,Patient,"So, for your car is actually a summer camp counselor in the mountains of Colorado. So. Every week a little bit different, but overall it was. It was fantastic the camp was amazing I loved it. I was not doing well on so I was like. Pretty multiple times of day. You know feeling just incredibly anxious about everything I a. Extremely insecure about my behind me. Just like crazy over exercise and under eating."
120.0,Provider,"For all of the all of the stuff going on, it was a mess. So there was quite a bit of restriction were there ever bingeing. You. go to bed sometimes too okay. because sometimes people will eat like a normal size, I mean it's hard to define what normal is and all that. But we'll eat like a kind of an average sized meal and then want to purge that or or risk or exercise to purge that and other people, will you know eat a significantly larger portion of food, you know and it's all scary food and things like that, and then will purge that and."
15542.0,Patient,So did you.
120.0,Provider,eat it okay.
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"All right, i'm. Just look at my questions. Are you experiencing any like health consequences from this like hair falling out or loss of period, or like really dry skin or extra cold."
15542.0,Patient,"My skin's and super dry. I never had any period of normality is. Okay um I used to be very cold, for a long time I have since like. Getting on a meal plans and helpful at all or Murray, something. called now it's cold outside."
120.0,Provider,Right right that's. what's expected to get like light headed we stand up or youth to.
15542.0,Patient,"Okay, I do that usually it's kind of like."
120.0,Provider,Okay. yeah that's. One okay.
15542.0,Patient,"Now, when I first started to me I have like dizzy spells pretty frequently those are a lot rarer than."
120.0,Provider,"The CSM dizzy spells but they're more managed now because your nutritionist better. be a good. Good okay um. So right now that you've been home Have you had any like purging incidences. Nice, even with exercise you're kind of managing on to good cool. What about. Like restriction right are you are you intentionally trying to avoid eating when you feel hungry, or do you feel like that you're honoring your hunger."
15542.0,Patient,i'm so. Using the Champs a lot about like faceless about honoring hunger and more about phone and meal plans and doing that. kind of strictly it's just it's hard to get on foods in. The course it's just meeting times.
120.0,Provider,"A lot of eating yeah. Go. Ahead hear ya. I used to wish that they had like human kibble like they have like dog food that you could use like here's your portion and then you just kind of eat it throughout the day. It would be convenient but doesn't work like that. All right, alright so. You ever engage in like laxative use or diet pills that kind of stuff. yeah Okay, and tell me about your exercise history like you'd obsessively exercise you to give me idea of like what that looks like."
15542.0,Patient,"And yeah so. that's been really complicated to train and pack because i've done sports since like it literally as long as I can remember up until Thank you. Okay, so it's really hard to start a separate late. What is composed environments are obvious but, like you know what's compulsive versus what is like for what was legitimate training was legitimate um. And so, a lot of it is like. You know, I have to work out for I go to bed or also be available so like you know 2am i'm on the treadmill even though i'm so tired, I can have in mind okay um or like waking up crazier and before before like canceling plants, I can go to the gym. A lot of stuff like that, so I think I never pretty extreme examples and that's sort of been priced out so far and I really been struggling to like figure out. You know. Well, there is behind it."
120.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard because there's you know eating disorders are a tricky tricky thing you know with substance it's a little bit more black and white in regards to doing it or not doing it. With eating disorders, you got to kind of filter through it figure out what's the intention behind your. Your stuff so yeah when do you think your English writer was at its worst without right before ERC or. Or is it has kind of changed symptoms all along."
15542.0,Patient,"yeah before right before your scene was pretty bad I don't know about. I think it also not really, really bad in the spring of 2019 mm hmm no see that's the worst but also like you know that was at the first time it got really bad and I think that's always a little more harrowing."
120.0,Provider,"If you mentioned that you had kind of had moments of where it was less and then moments when it was worse, so that was kind of curious what it was like then and or how. Or how navigated that because it's it does it does kind of evolve over time and have different stages. For sure. um what how tall, are you. And do you know your current weight. They do blind weights, then. yeah Okay, do you know if. You are in like on a maintenance meal plan or if they're trying to wait restores. For a reason, yes it's maintenance okay. Okay. um did you do, you did you normally weigh yourself like before ERC or were you were really worried about the scale. yeah okay. Do you think that your body, do you have any idea what your body is right now."
15542.0,Patient,not really.
120.0,Provider,"But you feel like it's at a pretty I know it's so hard to you know to that question, but do you feel like it's at a. Pretty average like where you need to be. Okay, and I know it's hard, because the eating disorder voice is like now it's a big balance, do you know that kind of thing. Okay um. Can you, what do you know. What. What your lowest weight has been, and when."
15542.0,Patient,"i'm about 140 in November of last year, December of last year."
120.0,Provider,"Of 2020. yeah Okay, and what about like a high wait."
15542.0,Patient,one.
120.0,Provider,Can.
15542.0,Patient,The summer of.
120.0,Provider,"2020 okay. And you mentioned being pretty concerned about the scale so would you would you way, like every day or multiple times a day or."
15542.0,Patient,Every morning.
120.0,Provider,"Okay. So that number was a big deal for you. Well i'm glad that you're not doing that now that's awesome is it throws you for a loop, if you do yeah. Okay. How is your body image, currently, how do you feel about your body."
15542.0,Patient,I see on the scale somewhere between like neutral but slightly On the negative side.
120.0,Provider,So it's more on the you know you're still struggling with with poor body image trying to work on that.
15542.0,Patient,yeah there's something like excessive is a. very much like it is what it is sort of thing.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah okay to try to just kind of like be patient and just be there without judging it too much good. So I thought my dog was at the door, but. Do you feel like your current body size is something that. you're able or willing to kind of maintain and get used to and be okay with okay."
15542.0,Patient,Good.
120.0,Provider,"because sometimes people are like well absolutely not I got I got to lose weight and that'll be okay, you know, like they're not that at that stage but you're like I gotta learn how to like this part of me that I have right now. yeah okay. Okay um. Do you have any particular food rules like certain foods you won't eat or that you're especially scared of or."
15542.0,Patient,You mean won't eat like foods and I really don't like your suits that are like see your food.
120.0,Provider,"Good question, I think, a more like what's the most people are like vegetarian or vegan. or they you know that, like like some food rules that way. and other people are like like i'm really scared of carbs or anything that's processed or anything that is. Not organic or whatever the people have different kind of ideas in their head of what they're supposed to be eating and other people are like well, and you know it's Okay, as long as it's all in moderation, I just was kind of curious where you're at with that."
15542.0,Patient,yeah really anything find or excessively oily is.
120.0,Provider,Okay.
15542.0,Patient,beginning a lot that was missing she's.

15542.0,Patient,yeah it's really a little weird things like personality. But like I will get into bed to life showered. You don't drive with the various three years our unit 37.
120.0,Provider,"So if you don't do those things your anxiety shoots up like if you don't if you have it at 14. Your you'd be like like like the radio volume. With a 14 that would kind of increase your anxiety, or if you didn't shower before bed that would increase your anxiety you."
15542.0,Patient,Know 1214 or 13 is.
120.0,Provider,"Oh, you can't have it at 30. yeah Oh, I think that it had to be at 30."

15542.0,Patient,"Like i'm really working on it, but like a lot of times I don't shower before bed. But pay more, and you can watch my sheets in the morning."
120.0,Provider,"Okay right okay so so some some kind of obsessive compulsiveness around cleanliness, especially with your bed and. Your body that kind of thing. All right, do you have any other do you have like any ADHD or any ptsd."

Do you have any other like physical abuse or emotional abuse that you would consider is that okay any significant traumas that you've experienced like you know things that have been influential like you know the loss of somebody that you love, or you know accidents or."
15542.0,Patient,i'm honestly just fighting with my mom.
120.0,Provider,That was pretty yeah cuz that's kind of a. Long know damaging thing.
15542.0,Patient,And you know when you're really close to someone cared about then. you're in a good position to say the most hurtful sauce.
120.0,Provider,"That is very true because that means more that way. And I imagine you were pretty frustrated with her with the fair and stuff sure okay. um. let's see looking for a job in the morning yeah MySpace for everything, do you have any any legal things going on, like did you try to press charges for the sexual assault or anything okay."
15542.0,Patient,Oh no that's really important each other and he told me to happen to the gym so. yeah wow. That was fun.
120.0,Provider,"wow wow. This is a guy that you were in a relationship with for a while. Here yeah but then he. sees a kind of hold you hostage emotionally like that oh. All right, and do you have any hobbies you do for fun."
15542.0,Patient,"For all of my hobbies for like Jim related, so I am working on that I really, really enjoyed board games and comics. So yeah I. i've been trying to design a couple of board games and so i've been doing quite a bit of that lately, but you know playing them for that sort of thing. yeah. I love watching like. The animated avengers kids shows was a really fun. This comes as a hobby but i'm a big plan busiest. Plant plant yeah I love to have well, I had a lot of houseplants unfortunately a lot of them died in my absence."
120.0,Provider,"I bet yeah. I like I like plants to um I my favorite one to the ones that will will live despite me, you know I yeah but I I like that, too, and that's cool. And, and you, you mentioned you through a lot of sports what kind of sports did you do."
15542.0,Patient,yeah so I swam through high school and college and before that I played volleyball for many years. And then you know for volleyball I like. Little league soccer and basketball and gymnastics and ballet and the. martial arts yeah like all the. All the sports.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you would go to the gym wasn't really just like kind of like treadmill and weights or that you say the gym."
15542.0,Patient,"So. I was very focused on like Cardio for weight loss, and then I realized like I don't actually cared. I lost eventually was like well I don't care that much anymore, and so I lost weight, when I was sick on the line. And there's like you know actually like waiting more than Cardio training so. I sort of started switching to what do I, like enjoy doing what benefits me most. Rather than like what's going to burn those calories."
120.0,Provider,"Right right cool. cool um well, I think that what you've totally I think you'd be a good fit for the Program. You know, one of the things about you know virtual treatment, obviously, is that you have to be pretty. Honest because you know we can't we don't know what your reality is so I think it's a really good step, especially for from having come from php because it with that level you're already kind of in the habit of not hiding stuff you know. You know, and then you have to keep yourself safe, you know because we can't do anything if you, you know get dis regulate it, or whatever and. have a hard time that way and same with following meal plans you know, like it, I always joke with it's a good, you know you could really easily lie and hide stuff. But, most people don't go into treatment because they want to get better at lying you know what people want to get better so. um. But I think that um I think you'd be great do you. Have any questions for me about it."
15542.0,Patient,yeah So how are you Nice and dietitian assigned.
120.0,Provider,"it's by state so it's the ones that are licensed in wherever you're living, so if you're in Missouri then you'll see the Missouri therapist. And then. If you move if you go to iowa you're a des moines and we. We have to figure that out because I don't know when you might be going and you don't even know when. Man, I know that i'm licensed in iowa iowa people, but I don't know. Like if they would like, if you were going to be moving while you're still in the program they would probably try to get the. Is there a therapist to apply for a license and I would agree to keep the same. As long as it's going well and. Just to avoid too many transitions. But, but it sounds like you're not really sure when that's going to happen either. yeah so. With that. yeah yeah."
15542.0,Patient,How long does the duration typically go and how do I know when i'm ready to jump.
120.0,Provider,"It average about 10 weeks. For most people sometimes it's somewhat insurance dependent because insurances I don't know your insurance situation, but some. You know, will only fund for so long. And there's other factors that way, but a lot of it as far as knowing when you're ready to step down. that's you know that's up to you, and in your team as far as your tweet your dietitian and your therapist about your level of confidence, your level of consistency. With avoiding behaviors you know and as you see your ability to kind of get through emotional flooding, you know emotional stress without engaging in this order. Because there isn't a you know you are curious to kind of think there isn't like that. So it's kind of about how you feel like you're when you feel like you're ready. But you know they're not gonna you know, like if you're you know engaging in terms of behaviors and like i'm ready to go I don't need to be here anymore, but you're gauging our behaviors and we're going to say no you're not. You know, but you know it's but if you're like no i'm really feeling confident you know, then you know that Ben would would support you in that. So. And a currently it's it's three days a week, Monday, Tuesday Thursday. And it's from three to six Pacific time, what are you in central time then. Yes, there'll be five to eight. Days. So there, there are two groups that are back to back with like a 15 minute break between them. So you can go get a drink or whatever. and Then you meet with your individual therapist dietician with whatever schedule works for you in them that can be. And we generally it's up to your dietitian but we frequently. Have you. Report your weight like. You probably won't have to do it, as much for you, because you you stepping down to a program so you're you know you're more your body's probably already kind of getting used to being in a new place in a new state. But you know every couple of weeks in though usually ask you to do a wait, where you go to your doctor and just do blind blind wait and. Or if there's somebody that you trust that you are around that you know, could help you with that, but for most people at the easiest to do with a doctor. And they generally will have you do labs and stuff before you start the Program. Just to make sure that everything is."
15542.0,Patient,That.
120.0,Provider,"Your body's you know currently I mean again because you came from a program and you're following your meal plan, like you, haven't been purging and things like that you, you might not have to do that so much, but sometimes they do that. on a regular basis for a new whenever you're nearly starting a program. or they might just request records from brc to because they might have all that stuff."
15542.0,Patient,"yeah I think you guys should have a Roi. Okay who's between it but. Let me know what I need to sign, I think I should have signed it already but i'm nothing."
120.0,Provider,"Okay yeah man was pretty good at getting all that stuff worked out so she probably was able to do that so. And so I think, as long as everything checks out with your insurance and stuff I might you probably could start on Monday and and. And because they probably are already looked into your insurance because usually they do that before getting into this step. But hopefully that will work and i'll i'll let them know that I feel good about it, and it seems like you're in a good spot, to be able to do this type of program so. Okay. All right, well, I hope, we'll see, I do have some of the group so i'll probably see it. At some point so."
15542.0,Patient,hey yeah Thank you.
120.0,Provider,"Alright, have a good rest of your day."
15542.0,Patient,You soon okay.
120.0,Provider,"See you later bye. Alright, so for recommendation is I O P level of care. diagnosis to major depressive disorder recurrent moderate generalized anxiety disorder. Maybe rule out OCD yeah I don't know if that. Is official yet, but i'm. Probably robot OCD. And then. The nri anorexia nervosa. anorexia nervosa binge purge subtype i'm going to look something up really quick. Alright, so actually change for the eating disorder diagnosis of os fed the otherwise specified feeding an eating disorder, with a subtype of a typical anorexia so i'm not sure if you put a typical anorexia as the diagnosis, or the os fed. But that's what it is, is that category of os bed with specify or have a typical anorexia, meaning that she has the that symptoms of anorexia other than the significantly low weight. Surely. Sorry, I keep looking at the. diagnostic criteria yeah I said I think what I said, is the typical anorexia. Although she kind of also meets criteria for the purging. disorder. The binge purge subtype. But the. fed. Is the best one."
