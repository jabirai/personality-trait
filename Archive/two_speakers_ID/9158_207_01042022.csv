9158.0,Patient,"I called in to make sure is compliant. And I had them send me that, so I just get back keep opening that email, and I did do it so sometimes it doesn't go all the way over and say thank you, it just goes back to the page. And i've noticed that sometimes it won't take it like it doesn't send it or something if you have to wait it out, because it will say. It used to give you a warning if you continue on it's going to you know you'll have to redo it it'll overtake it it didn't send me that warning, so I figured it went through that's not if. it's much done on the shelf right it's it's good time on time cooking i've real get home and be hungry I she's got a new love, which is a. broccoli salad Have you ever had it the Amish broccoli salad.

207.0,Provider,seven.
9158.0,Patient,Interesting characters if you can't see me it's just because i'm cooking. I think the interesting people in that group that's a good group. I like.
207.0,Provider,"That was what was it What was it that you, you knew about my group."
9158.0,Patient,"Just about recognizing what's wrong, you know and making a plan is to hold it. Like yeah our weaknesses our shortcomings."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9158.0,Patient,"It was, it was a second to think of one honestly. Everybody has like a lot of the same like people pleasing and said, have a lot of the same qualities. Like it's hard as. We value others over ourselves."
207.0,Provider,"We do we do we do and when we're when we're disappointed by people just how hard we take it. And inspired we find our worth and value to other people. Right and that and that, ultimately, is what when. You think about you know even your time in addiction and you think about you know depression, people who suffer with depression or anxiety, or you know you look. At some of the what kept us in our within our addictive behavior is always to suppress those feelings of guilt those. Lack of intimate relationships, whether it. Be by a potential partner or by relationships. You think about all of that, like how much value we put in. Other people and. What causes so much value in other people we don't recognize our own self worth we don't recognize our own potential and the things that we love about our soul."
9158.0,Patient,"yeah see I noticed, like my mom has character. And I think that all went back from lunch as a kid she would want her her mother was a midwife so she would go off and all our brothers and sisters my mom took care of it. And she could value and not rush to take your other people not say much in herself yeah and I see a lot of what i've seen in her I can't really see myself but it, I mean it's tainted hanging we. We place our self worth or now leathers. Not the caretaking is others or whatever."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm and you know what's interesting is I found in i'm. In watching, so my mom got me. Some time ago she got me into I binge watched sometimes on netflix like these old. Historical shows like shows that are based out of the 1500s or just out of you know, coming just into the 1617 1800s and you think about how life were was back content. And you think about how we have evolved so much since then, and it gave me a better understanding or a visual of just how. Especially as women, how we didn't have a whole lot of boys and you think about Roman even women who are in addiction, not even men, because I think there's a different partner, they play, but you think about women who. They you know whether they're alcoholics or drug whatever it is, whatever your your your your choice of addiction is or what have you. You think about how you came to that what brought you to that point you think about how much self worth and how much you do. You lack self confidence you you lack self love you lack the motivation you don't have a voice and you think about where did, where does the route all of that come from. and If you take a step back. And you look at your mom and your dad in in how they raised you. And when you you you take you today. In this modern day and age. And you place yourself. Back then, and just how. Their mentality is very. Different from how your insurance agent just kind of how hard it is for them to adapt to things today."
9158.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,How much of a voice does your mom have growing up.
9158.0,Patient,"You know. She we went to church, so I mean, like every Sunday and Wednesday, for me, and a lot of her voice was whatever dad said because, like the man says house Bible. So he was always I mean they. She she ended up, it was dad lost his job they sold the factory, where he was a supervisor there for years, my mom stayed home with us, then, when she went to work, the whole dynamics change. You know, for what dad started making dinner like that we never went one Sunday without eating fried chicken and all that after church. It was sent, and we did we can ever look at home from Sunday school and we would eat fried chicken and they would watch a little bit of TV and this kid to go outside play ball. We can then get dressed and go back that evening and embed time it was like what net for discussion, you didn't try to get out of going to church, it was not happening. You know, we was going lucid and in that view and if we couldn't sit with staining but then my mom went to queue up work all that changed, and then it became like mom would pay this bill and we'll pay this bill, you know, in it, they was that always if he said no, she stood behind it. Now you could go in there, and she was the way to me now she can get it if you really went to Jason guide your mom first and have her."
207.0,Provider,"But then, this is the manipulative and so, then so at some point, you have to. You have come to recognize that Okay, this is where mom sense so as you think about until you go back to like you said, this is what the Bible says. But then think about how much things are taken out of context, when it comes down to the Bible."
9158.0,Patient,A lot.
207.0,Provider,"Alright, so the idea of the man is the head of the House and a woman should submit don't you think when you think about in the in the umbrella in which is used, or in the context of how it's used don't you think it's taken out of context and abuse."
9158.0,Patient,"I did I do. All right, I mean my dad was never like you know i'm putting my foot down, you know. Never nothing like that that that was the understanding now then preachers and stuff that the ones that I grew up listening to they would. be like. use this with your kids and stuff all the time I just didn't how it works at our House, you know."
207.0,Provider,"But you think about you know where you come from and how how you have because. Think about the journey you've traveled in life, and why did you take such a detour to be on the journey that you did, and how long it took you it's kind of like you're traveling from Ohio to. let's say New Jersey and you follow you follow the map tells you this is the direction you take this is the journey you take from where you are in Ohio to get to New Jersey. But then you decide, because you decided to go on your own will and you make a beat or not recognizing hey this before it's gonna take you so far off your journey and at some point in time when you recognize that you've been on tour, it was to be held to try to get back on course right. And that's just how life has been, and the reason why it is it's because I decided to come off course, simply because of maybe how people have changed the context of something they change the narrative."
9158.0,Patient,of something.
207.0,Provider,"yeah so going back to the example of. The man being so look at look at the man being the head of the House will it's kind of like we have a President at the end of the day, the President is the face of the country, but the person is not the one that makes all the decision if that was the case you wouldn't have to do the. Senator so he is the face of the country, but he has to communicate and he has to consult with everybody else right he is."
9158.0,Patient,That carries out.
207.0,Provider,"So you think about you take that same concept and you come inside your home with it, the man is the face of that home. He is in charge of that home but, at the end of the day when he is in that home, he has to communicate with his wife and his wife understand what the rules are we communicate, we discussed, we come to an agreement. And so therefore now you being the face of this House, you are the man of this House, you carry out, whatever it may be now submitting to that rule and the order of how things should be. It doesn't mean on."
9158.0,Patient,"her neck, is that the terms that you know."
207.0,Provider,Here you go her.
9158.0,Patient,turns his head.
207.0,Provider,"head exactly but guess what he can't hurt if he can't turn left right back and forth unless he has given the direction and but we communicate that this is the best decision so then things are just taken out of context. But then, if you go back to you know how your mother was raised, and how her grandmother, and then you keep going back in time. And you see how we have evolved, as women and so because we didn't really have a voice How did we cope and How did we deal. With a lot of the emotional and mental abuse that will sustain in the home and just around whether you go to school and just how you were treated and you were not valued. And so, how did I cope with all of that, how did I deal with all of that. I got into a relationship only because I got pregnant I got into this relationship only because you know what hey you know what it was the thing to do to be in this relationship and that ended up being in a relationship that was not good. or I ended up with a man who was more jacked up than I was, and so what happened now I end up in a relationship that. I need to cope with it."
9158.0,Patient,"I ended up because of that, because of that upbringing I ended up not being ready for the real world, I thought that all men and women that's how their house run I never seen me by drink beer. You know internees mom here they're out there and parties and cheese and the kids his dad's mom she's sleeping with her his friends. You know I just didn't know that families like he cheated on his dad all the time and it, which is crazy, I was not prepared to people like them, I was not you know mom and then and never they never had around people like that. And I was not equipped for low with you."
207.0,Provider,"So you're not equipped. So then going back to I living in a in a Christian household. I was sheltered from the world, so there was."
9158.0,Patient,"No, I never stayed all night with anybody growing up, I never stayed all night with anybody."
207.0,Provider,"So freedom came about what. I said when you start seeing the upside of the world, you just was like oh whoa. yeah and you weren't prepared for all the nightmare you selling a trap, because there was no balance, you were not taught."
9158.0,Patient,"I didn't I didn't oh my gosh then people have lied and Chinese family I just never been around people like my life. it's mad, are they talking about you know she's talking about messing with his friends at the dinner table and i'm like is this APP and you know leave it and they'd all alive, and it was funny was unbelievable."
207.0,Provider,"You know. Interesting interesting but I, you know I think it's coming to that place of you identifying and you working on if i'm going to back on track i'm on i'm working towards my purpose in life are identifying that. And so it's it's identifying what are some as i'm on i'm on target i'm on course to where it is that I want to go in life. it's identifying what are some goals that I want to set and i'm want to be so focused on those goals that I work towards them and accomplish each of them, as I continue on this journey to ultimately being to the top of that pyramid you know that magical hierarchy. And it's like that's that's that satisfaction and it's that i've accomplished so much and all of that. And so it's identifying those things and but the way you do, that is, that you have to take a step back and reassess and analyze what is it that I want to live, where I am today. I want to be the best grandma that I can be. I want to be the. caregiver to my mother to my father, I want to be the best grandmother, I can be, I want to rewrite the course of my life."
9158.0,Patient,Yes.
207.0,Provider,But again. Have.
9158.0,Patient,makeup for straight in my 20s I mean.
207.0,Provider,"There you go but but look at it as a lesson learned it's an experience. So you're going for your your your propelling forward. You remember we taught in that group, there was a group, where we talked about. In propelling forward, it is okay to look in your rear view mirror, but you can only take a glance at it. If you stay focused in the rearview you are going to crash."
9158.0,Patient,"yeah now see Johnny called and my dad says, I want to tell you, Tony on she was just saying this, how much that you helped her with all three and she said, any resentment she'd ever had to do. that she didn't feel that way anymore that you know she was she was so thankful that name oh hi there she can then and just took over, and then open a done, and you know. that she was just really proud of you that how big of a help you really turned things around, and it really made me feel good. I said, are you serious dad he said I swear to you just I just got off the phone with her, he said. She she told him not to worry that I was doing much better is she feel a lot better about leaving mom and then here, you know Tony would come and help a lot my son and she said that you know aubrey. Because that that offer you know she said aubrey is to have a wonderful grandma she told her dad that you. shot because me and a lot of animosity."
207.0,Provider,i'm Kim the would be at the 18th at 1230 will not be okay.
9158.0,Patient,yep is it Wednesday any David Wednesday.
207.0,Provider,"No it's a Tuesday. Okay, no I don't have appointments on Wednesday. And I want, what I want you to do this, I want you to the next time that we meet I want you to really think about like you know what is it what is something that a goal that you want to set for yourself, you want to work towards. And let's when we meet we'll talk about that and we'll work on measurable goals. Each of them."
9158.0,Patient,All right. I was seeing me. not really no.
207.0,Provider,"No. i'll call you, if I see. Like what's going on, Kim."
9158.0,Patient,"Alright sounds good. All right, thank you bye."
