120.0,Provider,"Right, this is the ED I op individual session for Nina hammersley."
18370.0,Patient,hi. How are you.
120.0,Provider,Getting myself organized like usual how was your day.
18370.0,Patient,"With my hair, it was good, I got I got to see some of my friends and I went for a bunch of them and then i'm going for dinner for Italian food later tonight with my friends so that'll be good."
120.0,Provider,"Good, how do you. How do you do when you go out to eat does, that is, that like additionally anxiety driven or do you usually do Okay, when you have somebody else to kind of."
18370.0,Patient,"help it. kind of depends it's like like. depends on who i'm going with for sure, because i'm like what we're getting the situation, but a lot of time like with friends, is when I do the best because I really just try to not seem. weird or like different than them so as long as they're like good influence it or like yeah positive influences, for me, then, like that's usually what I do the best."
120.0,Provider,"Right yeah good you know what I mean that's the case for a lot of people as they. Young people, you know you can kind of mirror what they're doing and you're not likely to you know binge or whatever in front of you."
18370.0,Patient,yeah yeah no it's it's a lot like. easier to just go with them and yeah.
120.0,Provider,Thanks been going with the nighttime eating with the cereal and popcorn thing.
18370.0,Patient,"So still kind of pretty much what I like rely on like even if i'm doing better and i'm eating throughout the day I still would like say that the majority of my calories are coming at night, like. it's just like kind of the most comfortable thing at this point it's still like you said, like it's still kind of something is that I enjoy so it's hard to like eliminate it."
120.0,Provider,"Now, when you when you do that at night, is it. Is it kind of an indefinite amount, or do you have kind of an amount that you tend to eat."
18370.0,Patient,"Ah it's an indefinite about like i'm not like I like a not like okay you ate this much cereal you're cut off you're done it's just like I eat at. To my hunger, but I also focus on the time. If that makes sense, so i'm like okay I sat down and it's 9pm I want to be in bed by like 1130 so it's like more so, like i'm going to eat my hunger, but I want to eat it in this timeframe so that's kind of how I restricted I guess."
120.0,Provider,"Do you make any sense to. um i'm just trying to figure out how to how to help like because it's hard to change things all at once. yeah. He says set you up for failure, and so we want to do little shifts and my thought was. Is there like. Putting some like some popcorn in a big bowl and eating out of the bowl and then. You know i'm in do you usually eat out of the package. yeah MDS with a serial eat out of the box."
18370.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,You put it in like a cup or something.
18370.0,Patient,No it's just like my box of cereal though so it's not like gross but.
120.0,Provider,"No, no, no, I get that not worry about that, but. My thought was if you put it in like a bowl and then you can you leave it in the kitchen and take the bull or I don't do you do in your room like what what's the."
18370.0,Patient,yeah you.
120.0,Provider,need it in the kitchen.
18370.0,Patient,mm hmm but usually like everyone else's asleep.
120.0,Provider,"Right Dan are you like, playing on your phone at the time, or are you watching something or."
18370.0,Patient,"I usually just watch TV like a show that i've already seen, or something like that."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, because my thought is if there's a way of changing it up a little bit maybe you give yourself, you know big bowl of that so it's not like it's limited per se. But then take it to your room and have it, or the living or I don't know something and then, when it's done then just kind of think of this, this is my This is my snack. yeah like in mindless eating where it's a little bit more mindful."
18370.0,Patient,And then.
120.0,Provider,"Like I know I used to you know binge on ice cream That was my thing, and so I would eat it straight out of the container. yeah and. that's like yeah and and I was just do it until I was like in this like stupor and freezing, because it would make me cool you know. But then like, but I was like I don't know I want to still be able to eat ice cream, but I don't know how to eat it and I guess it's like this weird thing. So I was like if I put it in a container if I skip it out, put it in a container and then take the container away and put the actual container carton back."
18370.0,Patient,yeah in.
120.0,Provider,"The freezer and like like Okay, this is it like it gives it kind of a limit. And then that way. But you really want more you can walk back to the kitchen and get more. yeah but it kind of gives it a little bit of a limit and you know that might help switching it up where it's not saying you can't do that but it's maybe putting putting a little bit of a different structure around it."
18370.0,Patient,"mm hmm that's a good idea yeah like my concern with that I haven't really given it too much of a like chance because i'm kind of i've always thought of recovery is like all or nothing like i'm going to do it or i'm not going to do it. And not like I can take the small steps. towards it. But like when I originally gains like 30 pounds from. Like in around with 10th grade I was like bingeing so much like so much because I was just like starved for so long and. But I couldn't put anything in a content later I wouldn't. eat really that much like I would eat breakfast lunch and dinner, but then, after that, like I needed to eat a lot, not from like a plate herbal so eat like a lot of ice cream just from the container or like. Whatever it was, but like putting it in the bowl made me kind of like restrict again and go back to my obsessive brain, because if I was like. Putting the ice cream in the bowl I was automatically assuming like Okay, but how much of a serving Am I having how much Am I. Eating of this like I need to track the nutrition towards it now, whereas with like a binge I wouldn't do that. So that's like the only fear I have is like if i'm putting the popcorn the bullet and putting the cereal in the bowl now, am I going to start tracking the serving size and want to like go back to calorie counting almost."
120.0,Provider,"And you might mean that you. Re entry that might enter your mind, and you know, and so what what could you do to kind of you know, push back on them or not."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's been so long since i've been like calorie counting and stuff that I don't think it would be my first thought. But I I don't know if it would like a because initially a lot of the time when I like go for the cereal in the popcorn. I don't really feel hungry until I start eating So if I like put it in the bowl and might be like Okay, I just want a small amount, but I guess I could always come back and get another bowl."
120.0,Provider,"If I feel like yeah you could tell yourself, I can have more if I want to."
18370.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Make it The goal is to increase your mindfulness of it. That My suspicion is that you use it as kind of a way of relaxing at the. it's kind of your way of being like Okay, you know, some people have a beer, so people go take a bath some people, you know, whatever. yeah and you know I know that, like. I had a friend that for her it was every Friday should go out and get frozen yogurt."
18370.0,Patient,"But it was a very healthy thing you know she go get for me because, which is a way to celebrate Friday, it was kind of hash."
120.0,Provider,"Or do it, and whatever or you can just say I get to have a night I get to have ice cream or I have popcorn cereal, you know but, but instead of being like. it's I think you have an associated in your mind with relaxing. yeah it'll be hard to. To limit it because it's like I look forward to that time so much you know."
18370.0,Patient,yeah yeah and you get that yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah and it's it feels good, and you know is but, but we want to like, but I think is when that behavior continues to. kind of exist, I think it makes you afraid to eat during the day because isn't that kind of what you're afraid of is gaining weight because you're eating more at night, but you don't want to like that."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah because i'm like I yeah exactly like I don't want to give that up. But then I can't live a life, where I don't eat during the day and i'm afraid if I do both then like what. disordered yeah."
120.0,Provider,"it's kind of playing. You can go back like. My my one of my dogs leagues under the desk on her bed. every night shift at all, she runs out i'm. not going to kick you. Anyway, but what were we want to do is is kind of what we're wanting to shift your relationship with food. We want it to have a little bit of a different dynamic."
18370.0,Patient,You know.
120.0,Provider,"I mean, assuming that that's what you want, like that's what are your goals and that's something that you. talked about wanting to do because you know you can spend the rest of your life doing this and you, you know I mean it doesn't mean that you're a horrible person is going to go to jail, you know I always just think you know what do you want to be doing."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah and I think i've like become a lot more lenient about it, like i'm. Like today, I went for branch are going for Italian food for dinner and i'm need a lot of pasta and maybe I won't want any cereal popcorn maybe I will want a little bit like just kind of working at that and so i'm a lot more flexible it's just like it's still kind of that crutch. And there have been times, where I don't. feel like I need it like where I kind of follow my meal plan more consistently and then i'm like oh I don't need to finish my day with this, I just don't know how to like get there."
120.0,Provider,"Right, well, I am curious to see how it will be for you tonight because you know you'll have had to hopefully you know decent meals. yeah the brunch and then with without with your friends and and it's very possible to that you'll be with your friends, a little bit later. mm hmm now you know, and so it might be, but when you get home, you might be tired and being like okay i'm ready to crash and just mean one thing you could do. Is if you kind of like to to zone out I watching things you've seen before, and as eat you might experiment with i'm going to go lay in bed. and watch something in and watch those same things but not be eating like have a break it up a little bit."
18370.0,Patient,"that's a good yeah well like i've kind of been experimenting with that a little bit because, like my mom's working again now, after the break and so in the past couple days like she's in the family room or in the kitchen and they're kind of like all flow it's one. So I I don't want to like disturb or anything so and also with the show are marching it's on my roommates account, so I can't watch it when i'm home. um but so i've been like trying to watch different things, trying to mix up what i'm watching, so I don't get like comfortable in a routine of watching the same things. And then also eating in the office, instead, which is kind of weird but that's just what i'm doing i'm so that's that actually has been like okay it's different environment different show even. And it's been good like because it doesn't feel the same I guess right."
120.0,Provider,"Because you know if you were in a residential treatment facility, you know, then they pretty pretty much eat like a meal snack meal snack snack and so. On when you're there you get in a routine of eating at kind of certain times and the food is like it's on a plate, you know you have that snack. And you have a certain time that you have you know you have 15 minutes or whatever to have the snack or whatever it is, and then, when it's done it's done you think okay that time is done and then I get to eat again tomorrow morning. And you. Have a way of kind of putting a beginning, and an end to it, because you already kind of do that beginning and an end."
18370.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,"And, but what we want to help is kind of the dissociative part which is the you know checking out, but we also want to let you check out a little bit because that's how we relax at the end of the day, just kind of like sitting there and watching nothing, and you know."
18370.0,Patient,yeah we kind of mindlessly yeah yeah it's definitely very much unless.
120.0,Provider,"You. know another idea, you could do it, you could play around with is saying you know i'm going to do this every other night."
18370.0,Patient,yeah that's a good idea yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You like well it's you know I get to it tomorrow night like or whatever, just to kind of. or even to say i'm going to see if I can take two nights off a week of doing that, like. yeah on these no nights i'm going to do something else I can think about what you would do instead like i'm going to project or i'm going to talk to a friend or i'm gonna. I don't know or even just watching a documentary or something that the new things so that you got to focus on it and not."
18370.0,Patient,yeah usually what I do at school. Because on the weekends I don't like that it like dictates kind of my schedule so like Friday and Saturday adult and then.
120.0,Provider,awesome so you already know that you can.
18370.0,Patient,yeah yeah so that's good but I yeah I also can't. Do every day or anything but.
120.0,Provider,"Right right yeah. we're you know I mean and graduate like like my good friend who would you know. Have those extra treats on Fridays, for her you know, on being it and you can have you know you can like have kind of fun food or relaxing food every day, you know but. I do, that you get that you're fearful of eating, you know really large amounts at night because of you know potential for weight gain you know which lead Judas restricting during the day and that's kind of where the trouble areas."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah exactly and it's become such a habit that i'm afraid like Okay, I start the eating during the day, but i'm still so used to eating in that. yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,"yep. it's it's a tricky thing, because I, I want you to have the time to relax until we know just zone, I look forward to that so much. yeah look forward to that and this kind of zoning out. You know, and I definitely want you to be able to do that when we go to you know how to kind of like structure, the food differently so that it."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I don't want it to like take away from anything else, like I don't want to be like I can't go out with my friends so many go check out like yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's it's better. You know a lot of people have. kind of and nightly snack or like cookies and milk or whatever. Whatever you they like and. And that's that's totally fine you know, but if you're if you're really mindful about it when you're eating it, you probably won't kind of eat it in a non limited way, because it will taste as good when you're aware of it, because I think the part that you like, is the zoning out park."
18370.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,and its associated with it.
18370.0,Patient,yeah no I definitely think that's true.
120.0,Provider,"There are there, you could do is you know get when I was in Grad school for a while there, I was struggling with even a lot of cereal to discuss it so easy and. yeah to comfort food for me too."
18370.0,Patient,So what I did is I would get.
120.0,Provider,"By the boxes of cereal that I wanted, and then I wrote with a sharpie on the outside of the box like Monday, Tuesday. That box for Monday and Tuesday and then the next day Wednesday and Thursday or whatever, and so it just kind of helped me think this is i'm not gonna eat this until Thursday. yeah i'm not gonna eat this until Saturday, or whatever, so it kind of helps you spread it out a little bit and also remind you that it's not like just an unlimited free for all you know I want to have this as my snack because I love it, I want to have, I want to enjoy it. And it's okay to have. You know."
18370.0,Patient,"That, but I think that's where the times cut like help and I don't know if this is better or worse. But like what I usually do is like it's like okay so from nine to 1111 or like nine to 1130 your you can eat these the cereal in the popcorn. But then like as an ad cup pops up every time there's an add on like the show that are watching I don't eat. But then that kind of helps me like check in say okay I can't eat for these two minutes while I have ads like Am I still hungry do I still even want to eat it, but because it is like two hours sometimes i'm full and i'm like well, I still have time, I can still eat more so it's not like."
120.0,Provider,I don't fall you're still kind of you.
18370.0,Patient,"Sometimes, sometimes I feel like yeah like it's more like mental hunger, I was like Oh, I just want to."
120.0,Provider,"get it, yes, yes, I was gonna say that same mistake."
18370.0,Patient,distinction yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Mental mental hunger and and and I think it is, it is, it is tough that we associate food with relaxation like we're not good at kind of relaxing throughout the day or or like when we're not eating, because you know you think about it, like even the term lunch break. Taking a break or. Like I remember, I used to always be kind of jealous of people that smoked because they got to want to smoke break."
18370.0,Patient,And i'm like.
120.0,Provider,"Smoke breaks for non smokers, you know, like you know yeah. You know, like how you justify taking a break for yourself, even if food isn't necessarily involved or smoking isn't it so that's why I thought, maybe you could still kind of mindlessly watch TV for a while, but instead of sitting at the counter eating lay in bed. and watch on your phone and just to kind of change things up a little bit."
18370.0,Patient,yeah no that's too. Many.
120.0,Provider,"But i'm glad that you're becoming aware of it, because that's kind of the steps is is the first step is awareness and then like we talked about the whole on the sidewalk on Monday. yeah I just kind of thinking, if that is one of the holes, then you know how do we, how are we aware of it. i'm like, how do we practice it finding a different route."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah and I wanted to talk to you about the iot and stuff because I had mentioned earlier, I think, like way back will not way back, but like what I did the intake. about the time and stuff so currently as my schedule stands, I have a class that can like conflicts with the Tuesday I will be there. And i'm trying like i'm on a waitlist for like a bunch of them a bunch of other like sections of that class, but I haven't heard anything yet, but like. Do you is there, I don't like I don't know how, what do you recommend for this class it's like an entrance to major class, but I feel like the iot has been helpful, but I don't I don't want to leave, but I also need that class, but I couldn't do like two days or I don't know."
120.0,Provider,"Well, and yeah I hear your dilemma, I mean we know we usually you know. Like a whole called the boundary of needing to be there on time because of It disrupts the pattern. yeah and you know the group, but he sadness and that kind of thing, but you know one one couple thoughts I had one is um is you might be able to skip the line in in the being in the whole on hold for these groups, because you have kind of a different circumstance."
18370.0,Patient,So.
120.0,Provider,You know you go and talk to the professor and say hey I really need to get into a different section because i'm in this program and. Like they frequently will make room for you.
18370.0,Patient,that's a good idea.
120.0,Provider,"If a squeaky wheel, you know you got to be a bit of a head, this is important and is there any way, especially if it's the same Professor that teaches multiple sections. yeah you know. And I know that in some classes, especially intro level classes i've had them where you're signed up for one section like on paper, but you can attend during the other block of time. They take role, you know or whatever, but even then you talk to the Professor be most professors want you to be successful. yeah classes it."
18370.0,Patient,"it's finance and it's like I have to declare my major at the end of the Semester, but I can't declare my major until i've taken that class so it's like. yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,there's multiple sections of it right.
18370.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,Is it the same Professor that teaches the different sections.
18370.0,Patient,"I believe, so I didn't really look at the professor, but I think it is."
120.0,Provider,"Because or other professors to but you could go in. You know track them down to them an email, because most the time if a student is saying help you know help I need this, you know most most professors are like impressed by that actually because a lot of it shows that you actually care about."
18370.0,Patient,yeah like it.
120.0,Provider,What do you decide I would. You know exhaust those options.
18370.0,Patient,and see yeah.
120.0,Provider,You know what what is the time of that of that class on Tuesdays.
18370.0,Patient,"it's wait, let me look it's like a Tuesday night class which is tricky I believe it's 530 to seven, let me check."
120.0,Provider,Right smack in the middle.
18370.0,Patient,Oh sorry it's like i'm going to login.
120.0,Provider,While you're doing that i'm going to switch my camera and see if I can. Okay yeah my computer camera on it. Oh i'm gonna switch this out and. Actually switched automatically yeah.
18370.0,Patient,"Okay nevermind it is 630 to eight, so it is like very sad."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
18370.0,Patient,"But I don't know like i'm I just feel conflicted because I really do like the group, dynamic and stuff i'm like I don't know like I just being able to relate to all the mindfulness techniques and stuff and like things I didn't do before because i've always. been an outpatient and like there was definitely a time where I needed to be doing something, and I was completely in denial so like it is helpful to see all that stuff I just it's tricky because it's like managing."
120.0,Provider,we care about you either way you know.
18370.0,Patient,I wanted to ask you. I don't know if this is like allowed or like conventional but like if I can't switch my classes and I have to leave the iot can I still use you as a therapist.
120.0,Provider,"Well yeah it all depends on I mean i'm happy to do it all depends on your insurance i'm insurances are contracted for iot only and they don't do outpatient which I think is silly because it's just logistics. But some insurances are chill with it, you know and. So it."
18370.0,Patient,really depends on yeah. yeah we will.
120.0,Provider,"look into it, to see if that would be an option."
18370.0,Patient,yeah but it's.
120.0,Provider,meeting with a dietitian to though either on campus or with colleen.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah well I have like so I don't know if you know, Dr Anderson see her every two weeks, and may I don't know if you know her they're both great. And then, I have a dietitian she's awesome and then I also have a therapist and she's really, really nice, but like it's just kind of. tricky cuz she's she's like a therapist service and she doesn't specialize eating disorders and stuff so it's tricky So when I like started talking to you and I was like oh like you've kind of been through it like you get it. it's like."
120.0,Provider,yeah. yeah it's a little it's kind of. yeah it's kind of its own thing.
18370.0,Patient,Exactly yeah and like she's really helpful it's just she doesn't know how to help me in that way. But yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Absolutely so i'm happy to you know to to do that if again if the insurance will. yeah that happened but Prior to that, I think it would be good to at least look into the option of trying to advocate to get into."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah with the Professor yeah. No, I."
120.0,Provider,"Think because. there's a lot of the stuff we do in groups, you know we can do individually to. You, but I think that there's so much value in the group dynamic. see things in you that I don't see you know and you'll see things and other group members that that you know, like is that you can kind of call them out on stuff for help. You know kind of because we you know it's amazing to see like the best groups, I think. i've been a part of as one group members kind of call each other out and support each other, and you know. yeah things like that you know."
18370.0,Patient,"know that should I kind of already have like starting to see that and I reached out to cassie the one that has to leave because she also goes to penn state, so I would just like to keep in touch and, like the whole each other accountable, I guess, like, I have a friend from home, who did. Like a support group I guess kind of thing I know that over the summer together and she asked Chris penn state and we like meetup sometimes. which it is selling really helpful and then the other girl that's in mind that also hasn't been sort of we don't talk about that, but I feel like maybe. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Another resource is we do a support group that's free every other Saturday. Oh, and i'll be doing this Saturday, so we post it in the group me. do your part of that not right."
18370.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah all right, make sure that ever but yeah we post the number in there. Okay, because it's it's free you don't have to go to the virtual clinic since if there's no they don't take record. Oh, you just have."
18370.0,Patient,To leave I could still like go to that ever me. Know cool.
120.0,Provider,"You know what I did for people yeah it starts at it goes from 1030 to noon Eastern. Okay, so it's because for me it's 830 to 10 so it because everyone's different time zones, so we tend to eat at noon your time. And the people in there are great you know and they're from some of them, most of them have been in iot some haven't. yeah i'm just did outpatient you know different sorts there's a couple of them that are wanting to get into iot but their insurance isn't letting them yet so they're trying to be. happy, so there are some people that are in there, trying to decide about whether to seek a higher level of care, whatever so it's a good variety of people. I know i'll be. There will be will be will be doing in this week, this weekend."
18370.0,Patient,Oh cool. Thank you. yeah.
120.0,Provider,That I would have a job that.
18370.0,Patient,"Was the Professor thing I just want to write down the Professor thing, so I remember to email them."
120.0,Provider,"I do it as soon as possible, like I would do."
18370.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
120.0,Provider,"They can think about it, because they might have to make some adjustments, but I just know that happen all the time when I was in school. Especially classes that are like you know pretty big or that they have multiple sections of. yeah that's most of them aren't going to care if you attend a different lecture because they usually do the same lectures. Go during a different block of time, but have yourself registered in. The other section if it's a numbers thing or you could just say hey can I get registered for a different section. So. Because it would be awesome if you could stay in."
18370.0,Patient,"I know yeah I really liked like the just group dynamic like not even just like holding each other accountable, but just being able to be like doing things together, like that yeah just. yeah."
120.0,Provider,You have a good group of people right now.
18370.0,Patient,Nice.
120.0,Provider,"And our bond that cassie situation is what it is, but I also get it, because she's in graduate school and there is no other section like that is the oh."
18370.0,Patient,yeah that's not yeah.
120.0,Provider,it's kind of a little bit of a crunch time for her.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah no I know yeah I definitely would I like to. keep in touch with her, though. For both both of."
120.0,Provider,them there for sure.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah and we said, as a doctor."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah Dr Anderson so cool.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah no she's awesome. Yes, definitely knows what she's doing. yep."
120.0,Provider,"So i'm. Speaking of like. That if we think of the eating disorder as kind of one of the rare We talked last time, a little bit about the idea of seeing it as one of your employees in your life."
18370.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know, like what what does it do what is the role of place, you know, and you kind of put you in like a coma a little bit at night for a little bit you know, like it kind of uh. You know."
18370.0,Patient,It just like.
120.0,Provider,"After yeah yeah and it's probably because it's a good kind of way to unwind, so to speak."
18370.0,Patient,yeah and it's such like a habit now.
120.0,Provider,"And I, and I don't want you to give that up because you deserve to unwind at the end of the day."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you, I never ever thought about it like that, but that's exactly like the purpose that it serves."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah when I was really engaged in my disorder, it was something I did on the way home from work. Like it was. Really relaxing and then I was like I don't want to be doing this because it, it was like I didn't like I didn't like that about myself I didn't like that pattern. And so you know gradually kind of shifted. Instead of putting putting focus in dog training stuff and and that was helpful because I wanted to be doing that more, and you know it's hard, because I want you, you know I say I want you to be able to relax and we just got to find out other ways of you know, helping you do that. yeah well that but, but it is part because eating does hit your pleasure Center it does you know. yeah makes you feel good. And I want you to be able to do that, but. We want to. figure out how to do it. Like in a limited way, where but not limited where it triggers that restriction side."
18370.0,Patient,yeah no yeah that's like the perfect perfect balance.
120.0,Provider,"I pour cereal into cups I have a. Oh, a cup that I tend to use or like I often use like a cottage cheese container."
18370.0,Patient,or a I.
120.0,Provider,"do feel like I have one two containers. Like I like I can use this for something. So you know I didn't. really got to. catch it yeah for importing it into like a Quart size of luck bag. or something like that. And and allowing even if you didn't accept my bag thing you could zip it up when you're when you're done and leave whatever is in there. Or you can have whole thing or whatever, but, but like instead of because when you're doing the box, it is a little harder to be aware of how much you're eating."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and and that's kind of what drew me to it in the beginning, because I was so like sat on calorie counting. Yes, so yeah I think i'm going to place our I could. kind of get away from it just annoying they went from like such restriction to such bingeing that it's like."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah well and it's interesting because you know. When you were in that world of such intense restricting that was miserable I don't blame you for not wanting to go back to that I don't. That you know.
18370.0,Patient,yeah definitely don't want yeah.
120.0,Provider,But it's a hellish way to live.
18370.0,Patient,"I know yeah and I want to like not have osteoporosis anymore, and like. That stuff so it's like gotta not yeah live like this."
120.0,Provider,"yeah and also, I mean talk about misery when you're constantly you know you can't like relax around food because it's always this."
18370.0,Patient,"Man, I know I was definitely Moody all the time."
120.0,Provider,"That I bet you know and and also it honestly it affects your IQ to I. One of my early and. She when she was in Grad school, one of the things that she did and. Part of her doctorate program was measuring IQ like people's ability to solve problems quickly and the people that were malnourished were not as bright. Like the good thing is is they thought they were but they didn't they didn't realize that there weren't quite. If they weren't thinking as clearly as they as some other cohorts and the common denominator, was the restriction piece."
18370.0,Patient,"That says, you know if, like you get that back when you repeat or. didn't."
120.0,Provider,"Like about your brain, I mean your brain. And you know, like we like when I was in Grad school we're talking about like. You know, social work in general, but one of the things was. Like food and housing for people in poverty, you know and and some and they made the statement that, like in therapy, so to speak, it's it's hard to work on your inner child when you have nowhere to sleep tonight."
18370.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
120.0,Provider,"On your issues when you're starving. or yeah filter and so your brain can only process so many you know things going on at the same time, and if it's if it's already stuck in i'm starving I don't have enough food, it puts your body into a. Highly anxious state, because it feels threatened."
18370.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"It to this like okay I gotta be aware, I gotta like a highly anxious kind of self preservation state because it's it's a dangerous when you're starving like your body and so when you're in that hyper arousal state your brain doesn't have as much power to use for things."
18370.0,Patient,I mean it.
120.0,Provider,"Is you know, taking care of and you're not conscious kind of like it's hard to concentrate in school, if you have to pee really bad."
18370.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
120.0,Provider,"you're like i'm trying to pay attention but you're like. Trying to home, you know or whatever like it's it's physiology kind of takes her."
18370.0,Patient,Know yeah.
120.0,Provider,you're if you're going to like puke or something or whatever like it makes it so you can't think as well.
18370.0,Patient,"And yeah. It doesn't matter what age, you are when you recover like because."
120.0,Provider,"Well, I think the longer you engage in the disorder, probably the harder or the longer it takes to. kind of rehearse everything. But you know, I have to ask her about the outcomes of those studies as far as really nourishing."
18370.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"I do know for sure that the anxiety decreases. When you're yeah so so it would make sense that, like your cognitive would increase."
18370.0,Patient,That yeah. anxiety yeah no definitely I feel like. ruin me I don't want to like totally destroy my body. bit of that already.
120.0,Provider,yeah I mean your body is just fine and he needed to work well and to work well throughout your life and. And the way you treat it now effects down the road for sure.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's important yeah Dr Amos always talks about like the cycle like if you're well nourished you keep having like I don't know restrictive thoughts, but she was convinced that was malnourished and I was like no i'm just like thinking all the time."
120.0,Provider,Being now malnourished can also does mean like. differently nurse like where you're not balanced it's not.
18370.0,Patient,You know.
120.0,Provider,"It doesn't always mean a calorie deficit, it can also mean a lack of variety, or it can mean like. You know, like like people who are who overly use things like energy drinks, you know it's not great, for you."
18370.0,Patient,Either I know.
120.0,Provider,You are of cardiac arrhythmias from doing that.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no. yeah I and she like 100% knows exactly what he's talking about, but I just yeah I was probably a little in denial, but."
120.0,Provider,Well yeah because when you're you know it's hard to it's hard to be aware of it when you're in it.
18370.0,Patient,"You know, we oh yeah. For sure yeah. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"But anyway, but I wonder if there's a way of you know, I was going to ask you, like throughout your day. What is it like what is it like to be you like is your is your average day pretty stressful where, at the end of the day, you really crave that kind of. downtime or like is there a way you can practice spreading that out so that it's not just at the end of the day when you get to relax but, once you, you know, take a walk or you know take it, you know I love i'm a big fan of NAPs if I can make."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah. You know yeah I mean definitely like dabbled in that um I don't know sometimes like sometimes i'm just go go go non stop until I get to the end of the day, and then I can do. But then other days I kind of like relaxed throughout the day like sometimes i'll like watch a YouTube video, while I eat lunch and then it's like okay for these 15 minutes I need to relax and i'm going to pick back up whatever i'm doing. And like that's helpful because it's it's a clear, concise amount of time and it just like zone for a couple for a bit of time and I have like a plate of lunch, and then I move on. um so that's good or like when I was following my meal plan it was still like probably not perfect, but I was like. Eating three meals and then a snack and then I would have dessert and then like if I didn't feel like I got everything I needed for my meals my dessert would be like pretty hefty. But then, like the desert was a way to relax and it was like something in a bowl that I can go back for more if I want. But. yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,"At some point, you know as you are able to shift kind of the meaning that that that nighttime eating is for you or shift the role of place, it might become kind of boring. Over time, because, like like right now, I have two things of ice cream on my freezer that I can pick any to eat that because it's going to go, you know go bad if I mean not go back to the."
18370.0,Patient,Future yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"And I might add to that, but, but like years ago there's no way that would have lasted more than a day."
18370.0,Patient,Really yeah yeah no I definitely.
120.0,Provider,"i've been there, can you recognize that yeah like I like. I can have in the House without like eating."
18370.0,Patient,yeah like complete yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yep I was the same with like peanut butter, that was a big one."
18370.0,Patient,Oh yeah I.
120.0,Provider,"have it, I have things have it in the cupboard and it doesn't really own my life anymore."
18370.0,Patient,yeah and it's like those dense things so stems things are always what I wanted like granola I would eat an entire bag of granola what yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah he's come a day when it'll become less like me, and one thing that's interesting is like what if. I mean this is this is just a What if i'm not saying to do this, but I know when when I was in treatment, one of the things that they would have us do once in a while, is a challenge day where you would eat the same thing all day long that that is the only thing you got to."
18370.0,Patient,do that.
120.0,Provider,"And just eat, like all you, it was granola all day and then, if you still want more granola next day you eat all the Colonel all day, but after a while you're like me something salty now because."
18370.0,Patient,"I feel like i've. been doing that, with pumpkin so but I guess I because I haven't been doing that, but I used to do that a lot like but through my. Through restriction like when I was really calorie counting I would have like okay you're only going to eat cereal today and it's like cereal for breakfast lunch and dinner, and like I yeah so I believe, when I used it in the wrong way."
120.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean, and I did, would you spread it out through the day or did you always wait to the end of the day, to eat it."
18370.0,Patient,"I was spread out throughout when. I was it's weird it's weird because when I was getting I was obsessed with like not destroying my metabolism, even though I totally was like I would wake up. Wake up and i'd be like, I have to eat within half an hour and then I have to eat within two hours so yeah like I was constantly doing things that I thought were reversing it, they were."
120.0,Provider,Do you always eat the same cereal.
18370.0,Patient,"Back then, I will now I don't care now cereal cereal, is it tastes good I like it all yet and i'm I will eat like kashi ones that have like granola we're."
120.0,Provider,Like okay like kashi do you eat like fruit loops and things like that.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah I love like pretty much all cereals, I really i've been trying to eat a lot of the protein ones, because i'm in my head. It has more substance and is."
120.0,Provider,"He wants to because I I like I, like him, and also it."
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, I like. We, the cinnamon one or the other yeah I love that one."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I eat it a lot with yogurt."
18370.0,Patient,"In the morning oh. yeah I do that too, sometimes."
120.0,Provider,that's one of my breakfast every day but that's one of the ones I like and. yeah just make you feel fuller like it's sad it's more satisfying then. he likes like corn flakes or whatever.
18370.0,Patient,"No, I agree, I really like it."
120.0,Provider,"But at some point, you know I The hope is that your body will become somewhat satiated from it and it won't be as exciting."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah that's. fingers crossed because. right before. I went into the company, I went to go man, I was like done with my lifestyle like I didn't know how to change, but I was like i'm sick of this, and so sickness and then obviously when I got a hospital were. forced to change. But then slowly I kind of like regressed back into it yeah which it's it's not a strict but it's still the same lifestyle."
120.0,Provider,"Of the coma thing i'm still amazed that like like how much water, did you drink."
18370.0,Patient,"See I don't remember, but they estimated it was between two and a half to four and a half gallons. So it was like a DC cloud."
120.0,Provider,You could even do that you know.
18370.0,Patient,"No that's what they get that's why they were so convinced that I was on Ecstasy, because they were like her body would tell her stop like her body wouldn't let her. just keep drinking water and my parents just kept being like no you don't know our daughter like if she says she's going to do something she's doing it, which is kind of true."
120.0,Provider,"But I know you said that you were drinking it because you were dehydrated from panning but how long did you tell him, for I mean were you like fried."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah well, so all day Friday like I timed it, it was four hours before to four and a half. But I was just outside of. You know, like just laying outside of my backyard."
120.0,Provider,"Oh other the tanning bed, I was oh."
18370.0,Patient,"yeah just laying outside of my backyard um but. It was it was like 90 degrees that day, so it was really hot really like not a good idea to sit out there that long. And then I just felt like really wonky which was probably just because I did that, but what I was looking up to set test said to keep drinking water. So I just took that to the extreme. Then Saturday night is when I was like in the hospital and stuff right."
120.0,Provider,"Well, I also wonder to you know if i'm sure they've already talked about this, but you probably went into that incident with wacky wacky electrolytes."
18370.0,Patient,Because yeah.
120.0,Provider,So it wasn't.
18370.0,Patient,Like going oh yeah yeah I get those checked a lot now but. yeah I probably did.
120.0,Provider,"yeah cuz it, you know you don't know like going into it, like you, maybe you might not have had to drink that much water like it, but I may have you know, to set you over the edge, because your body was already halfway there you know."
18370.0,Patient,yeah like kind of gave myself a head start. yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"that's the super scary because you know, like can imagine if you're giving yourself brain damage or something."
18370.0,Patient,"I know I know I were so lucky, because the telemedicine doctor said to go to urgent care and like she said, I was hydrated which so that I drink more water, but she didn't know, but my my job. yeah what yeah."
120.0,Provider,yeah wouldn't make sense but yeah.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah I do yeah but I, you can only do so much I guess over the phone. But my jacket my neighbor, just in case and he was like take her to the hospital and every one of the hospitals, if you went to the earth and carry literally would have died, I was like Oh well, that's good that like I didn't do that."
120.0,Provider,"You have you ever heard of Terry chevaux we're who that person is. No so she this was the thing that happened. Man I don't know how remember when it was, but it was you know, years ago, probably 15 years ago, so you, you probably were a little tiny thing. But anyway, it was all over the news. that the whole thing is Terry shadow was a woman that was in a coma like on a ventilator and there was this big debate about whether or not to you know quote pull the plug. And, like her husband wanted to withdraw support wanted to let her go because doctors were all saying you know there's no hope blah blah blah. and your family or parents and we're saying no he's only doing that because he wants to collect on the life insurance. But there was a court, there was a court proceedings about it. But but but but anyway, she was in that situation from an eating disorder. Really yeah I learned that later i'm like oh my gosh that's freaky because she messed up or electrolyte so much that she."
18370.0,Patient,"I know I. it's like stories about somebody else I just do not acknowledge like when I hear about somebody else like Oh, but I just like make jokes about it, so I shouldn't do that."
120.0,Provider,"you're probably make jokes about it because it's easier to tolerate you know the. yeah the side of it, you know."
18370.0,Patient,yeah for sure my parents do not like when I make jokes about it it's.
120.0,Provider,not funny.
18370.0,Patient,"Oh yeah they're like they get mad, but my friends make jokes about it as."
120.0,Provider,"Well it's a coping skill, just like whenever things are used to joke about things."
18370.0,Patient,Like drink water or did she just have messed up electrolytes.
120.0,Provider,I don't know I think she had millenia. electrolytes that did that.
18370.0,Patient,easy.
120.0,Provider,I think she had gone in a stroke or she had have like cardiac arrest and then had an intoxicant brain injury where. Her brains without oxygen and.
18370.0,Patient,"So yes, so so scary. Like cool. I mean obviously yeah they are really, really, really scary."
120.0,Provider,"we're seeing on the news, and there are always people like protesting outside the hospital with signs that were like. You know, save terry's don't let her die oh."
18370.0,Patient,My gosh.
120.0,Provider,"That kind of thing, but there were other people that were like don't make her suffer she has no quality of life."
18370.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,she's gonna be on ventilator forever and I think they did eventually let her go.
18370.0,Patient,that's that's probably for the best yeah.
120.0,Provider,Because there's really nothing left they could do with it.
18370.0,Patient,yeah it's like there's the quality of life that sad.
120.0,Provider,it's freaky but it's a real thing so. yeah I want to do a different is is smart.
18370.0,Patient,yeah one day I don't want to go down that path yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So what do you think would be and we've talked a little bit about. that the role of. kind of the relaxation at the end of the day and and then a couple of different ideas of how to begin kind of chipping away at that a little bit and little little pieces instead of changing it all at once, you know and. or any of those any any ideas we talked about something that feels like manageable."
18370.0,Patient,"I like changing the routine in small ways like and that's something that might, there is also before also talked about she was like what if you still eat at night, but you try like. mixing up the cereal or you don't do popcorn zero anymore you just try eating other things for a while. And I think that that's like the best thing that I do, because every time that i've tried to like cold Turkey, I always go back, I always like i'm really just I crave it I want it and I can't do it even like even. Like i'm only going to do it twice a week it's still like oh i'm just focusing on that, and when I finally get it it's like works i'm leaving like. More than one box of cereal because I just craved it, so I like that idea to like mix just mix up the routine make it different and and putting things in bowls and pulling things like making it more concrete have a limit."
120.0,Provider,"yeah say put it in a bowl and it can be like a big serving bowl you know, like you, don't have to put. A teaspoon or whatever, but. hey but it didn't like a bowl and then put the box, you know close the box backup. yeah you do and put it back in the cupboard so it gives you a beginning, and then an end, you know what goes back and then that way you know kind of like when you brush your teeth, at the end of the day, if you're good at that if you're not then you know i'm not always good but."
18370.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
120.0,Provider,"But it's kind of it's a marker. Of this, or. You know. Like. You know other other things that kind of symbol, like, for me, I am a little farm and so like when I go to feed the in the evening that's kind of a marker of the end of that day we're going to start that evening routine or. You know what because we're all we're all kind of creatures of habit. yeah to think about little kids if they don't have naptime they don't have dinner time they get crabby they get honoree they get hyper."
18370.0,Patient,Like the.
120.0,Provider,team they bed.
18370.0,Patient,"And I love having her teen I feel so bad I knew my parents helped me so bad i'm a mom keeps like she keeps sending me podcasts about like. Creating habits and i'm like yeah like i'm trying to create habits that are good and not like toxic for me, but I yeah i'm definitely like a creature of habit, and this is my habit so it's like working on breaking that I guess what."
120.0,Provider,"You might consider my know you're going to be going back to school, so you won't be living with your parents. Right you're going back. yeah yeah. Okay yeah next week, I mean one thing you might consider doing is getting into a new series, and like a netflix series. and watching it with. A roommate or a friend or your parents like."
18370.0,Patient,"Oh, my room and I do, that I just usually eat wow be do I."
120.0,Provider,"Doing okay well being one thought is. That like like you had said that you do better, when you eat with somebody else so like if you said okay i'm gonna have my bowl of popcorn. yeah in my bowl of cereal and then let and then eat that with your roommate while you're watching something, and maybe try to do that every other day, or something so that and it for like an hour, if you watch the new episode or something. yeah like binge watch it where it's like like you're zoning out for."
18370.0,Patient,me yeah. yeah.
120.0,Provider,create a certain pattern and it's not going to be easy because it's a new it's always hard anything new was kind of hard.
18370.0,Patient,yeah no but I like that better than what i've been doing.
120.0,Provider,"Because it's kind of like people who are addicted to exercise is their way of calming down they go to the gym forever We often talk about Okay, how do we we don't take this away from you, because it's something that you value but."
18370.0,Patient,Can we add.
120.0,Provider,else so that you're not doing it alone.
18370.0,Patient,I know I should be addicted to that too huh.
120.0,Provider,"yep yep well. In a way, that is, like i'm going to go do one exercise class and then i'm going to be done."
18370.0,Patient,And so yeah.

18370.0,Patient,"know I don't know I don't know how like. If if I will eat popcorn Israel today because i'm going out with my friends, but if I do, I definitely, at least at the bare minimum, want to eat it somewhere else and watch something else, but I think I want to try, putting your level. And then yeah."
120.0,Provider,You can go get more if you want to it just requires you to get up walk the kitchen and pour it.
18370.0,Patient,yeah and like make that conscious effort.
120.0,Provider,"yeah it makes it because it is, it is put a little bit of a speed bump in there."
18370.0,Patient,"mm hmm I like that I like pausing throughout it. To kind of, say, like, I agree, but I think that's better like having a bowl."
120.0,Provider,"yeah and also it gives you a visual limit of because you know that's one of the things I always talk about with you know you know people who are struggling with compulsive overeating is is the value of putting it on a plate or putting it on it in a container. Is it a specific and it also tells your brain, this is what we're having. And it does it's not like an endless you know."
18370.0,Patient,yeah and I don't like waking up really full and then it makes it harder to follow my meal plan and it just creates that cycle again.
120.0,Provider,i'd be interested to know what it does to your sleep too.

120.0,Provider,When you eat at night. You right to your stuff is that what it feels like.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah it's like it's like i'm eating and then I feel like okay like I could probably stop now, and sometimes i'm like okay i'm going to bed, and then it depends because. Sunday is, I feel like okay i'm done, and then I go to bed and i'm like oh i'm hungry I should have been more than other days i'm like I should be going to bed, but i'm going to eat until i'm really, really full and then I go to bed and i'm like oh that was close."
120.0,Provider,to feel kind of yucky right if you're in that because I know like for me if I eat too much. Like like like a fruit loops.

120.0,Provider,When it shifts before it goes into that kind of like uncomfortable spot.
18370.0,Patient,"yeah and that's why I like having more foods with protein, because I feel like when I have a higher protein yeah."
