14841.0,Patient,Now it works.
298.0,Provider,Now it works I. It makes no sense at all.
14841.0,Patient,"Why, no. yeah."
298.0,Provider,And and i'm not like the super guru when it comes to zoom so I don't even understand it.
14841.0,Patient,yeah I know it took me a minute to be able to adjust to zoom.
298.0,Provider,So how is your medicine working for you.
14841.0,Patient,"Today it has been helpful it's been a good day I started both new doses, and I have been more motivated today I haven't been so depressed I haven't been distracted by everything and. When I when I say distracted I mean like little things will distract me to the point of making me feel a certain way, like a negative way. And it's kind of hard for me to deal with that, but today I feel like things have been good."
298.0,Provider,"uh huh okay well let's enjoy this while we've got it. So, are you having any cravings."
14841.0,Patient,"No, not at all."
298.0,Provider,Okay um and no relapses. nope okay and House how are you doing in our Program.
14841.0,Patient,"I honestly I love the group that i'm in I love the. He I think he is awesome and he's I love that he's honest because, like he'll ask a question at the beginning of every group and last week, he asked. What basically what I what we do to to I guess not relapsed or how we how we deal with cravings basically and I said I tried to distract myself like change my thoughts and. He is very honest and he basically said, and he didn't single me out because a lot of people had that answer, but he basically said that. distracting and avoiding basically are one in the same when it comes to addiction and as long as i'm still distracting myself i'm not dealing with it and. I don't know I just like that he said that, because a lot of times in the past counselors will just agree with you just to agree with you. That he is honest, because in the long run it's going to help me."
298.0,Provider,Good i'm glad that that works for you.
14841.0,Patient,"yeah there are some who will get offended. I know it, and I, I felt so bad, because at the end of group on Monday he was like not calling anyone out individually, but he was just saying like. Look, if you're if you're only here to get your meds just let me know i'll have more respect for you than if you just continue to come to group and not pay attention, I felt so bad, because I do pay attention in group, but I just felt bad because I know a lot of people don't."
298.0,Provider,So so. I felt embarrassed. That. I was like don't run off my patient.
14841.0,Patient,I know because a lot of people really personal.
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah I was looking at it from and then i'm like I work with so many different therapists and they all have different styles and I and they're not me and I need to appreciate the value in each one of those.
14841.0,Patient,"I think he's really great and i've seen i've seen hundreds of different counselors and been in hundreds of different groups, and I really I respect him a lot and i've only been to two groups, but I do like him a lot oh. That is."
298.0,Provider,Good that's good to hear I how's your sleep.
14841.0,Patient,"um it's my sleep is so weird and it always has been kind of weird like when I had when I was in a healthy sleep routine I would be going to bed early and I do now, I get out of workout like seven or eight now. And I get all my take a shower and I go to bed, but I wake up a lot and I don't I hate it because it takes me a minute to fall back asleep. And then I feel like that's why i'm kind of tired, the next day."
298.0,Provider,"That makes sense. Okay um i've got to go. Is there anything else that I can do for you. Know hold on nope alright, it was nice seeing you take care."
