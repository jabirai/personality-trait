760.0,Provider,You feel that's no longer the case.
16776.0,Patient,"yeah I you know, because when I take my meds and i'm happy, you know it works, you know, and then, when I take my meds. And i'm when I don't take my meds and i'm upset you know. I can feel that i'm being triggered i'm getting worse, so I still take them regardless okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so do you think that you need to. Do you think you need to talk to the prescriber and perhaps change some of your medication."

760.0,Provider,You don't think you're getting sympathy.
16776.0,Patient,"Now I don't nobody like I don't get hugs no nothing like that don't have family here, you know, and you know I feel like my wife kind of brainwashed my son. Because it's only Okay, when she takes them out and so he's always going with her so when we get in a fight that she she manipulates the kid to go with her and I confront her about that, and she does not believe it, you know. And we've tried couples therapy and we almost ended up. We screamed at each other's lungs out at each other and I ended up walking home and I took the keys so she had to get a ride home, and it was nasty so. And then she dies. yeah and then I tried last year, you know, but it couldn't work because she was too busy being scared about the epidemic. She has every right to be, but you know we also got to live our lives. I didn't want to take the vaccine, but I took it for just so it can make her happy."
760.0,Provider,So is it fair to say Arthur that you're feeling pretty isolated.
16776.0,Patient,"yeah I feel isolated every time we fight like who do I talk to, I have my son talk to, but you know he's kind of more on his mom's side, so you know other you know that's why like we only played basketball, and we throw the football around I tried to talk to him, but. I did we play video games together."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16776.0,Patient,"But um other than that you know. mom's the big hero, you know because she manipulated."
760.0,Provider,"All right, um. So talk to me about your self esteem."
16776.0,Patient,"yeah I don't have a really good self, esteem, especially living with her."
760.0,Provider,Has it has that been the case for a while.
16776.0,Patient,Arthur yeah because when we fight we don't talk to each other for weeks and. You know.
760.0,Provider,Why my friend's house.
16776.0,Patient,"yeah i'll i'll sneak off to my friend's house, because I can't I can't keep doing this, you know there's not healthy for me, being in the House all day long. I get stuff done, I do chores and, but you can only do so much you know I, I have a right to hang out with my friends only have two friends to friends. it's not like, I have a whole gang of friends. And then I do so much for my sister in law, I every single day I pick up her oldest son from high school I drive him to her work I pick up her youngest kid and I take them home so so that you know. That doesn't so they don't have to worry about you know. worry about more things and then then because they work, you know. mm hmm like. and"
760.0,Provider,"So you think you're the one that's always doing for others, and nobody gives anything to you."
16776.0,Patient,"know they do you know. they'll invite me or they invite me but. I don't don't have any connection with them, because no. they're just so. fed up with the coven thing you know we go out to eat the only place we go to is a one restaurant because it's outside. And i'm sick and tired of that place you know, but if I say anything i'm the bad person and. I don't like to go out with them, because when we go out on TRIPS, you know she ends up fighting with their sister and. I don't even want to be in the middle of that stuff and it's just very depressing. You know she doesn't even get along with their husband when her husband her husband and her fight like we went on a recent vacation in June. To la and you know we rented a airbnb by the beach and stuff and they got in a fight, you know we wasted two days, because they wouldn't talk to each other. You know ever ever since there. My mother in law passed away, you know, everybody split up. And my. oldest brother in law, my youngest brother in law do not like my wife and her sister that tells. us something."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so perhaps your mother in law was kind of the glue that held your mother or your your wife's family together is that. fair to say, like. Everything kind of calm and so now that. The split there's all this family fighting and toxicity."
16776.0,Patient,"very toxic like they my old my youngest brother in law's wife doesn't like them. And you know. I understand where she's coming from. But she's not also innocent, either because she has never took time to hang out with the family, and now that she just had her kid she literally just had her kid like four days ago. She does not let anybody see the kid. my brother in law's is like he's scared to talk to a sister's. me because she'll threatened to leave him and get him for child support, so he has in his and his perspective, he has no choice but to. You know. Be with her. Because she's afraid that you know she's going to use the end i've heard her on the phone you know we've heard her on the phone. Because he was she kicked him out and he was staying with us and you can hear her screaming on the phone and i'm going to make your life miserable and it's just so he's going crazy and. You know he's not stable, you know it's just."
760.0,Provider,"So sounds like you're dealing with a lot of issues with your within your in laws family, and it may be feeling overwhelmed and isolated and and your own family is all in Mexico yo do you have any family."
16776.0,Patient,"I have family ancillary which is maybe. 30 minutes from here 3045 minutes from here, but."
760.0,Provider,and

And I had to stay with my cousin. Most with my dad and my cousin for like a week. And I stayed with them. came back from Mexico didn't have Kobe i'm not saying i'm. coven you know prove i'm just saying you know, like I don't know, maybe I did have Kobe earlier and maybe I didn't show symptoms and now you know. i'm good, and now that i'm triple vaccine like I don't know what more I feel like this stupid thing ruin my life. Like I don't really talk to anybody like. Sometimes you know my friends have a life to me have family."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16776.0,Patient,"So you know other than my son. You know you're like the only person I just talked to you today, because my wife don't talk when we get in fine."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're in the home, all day you don't you don't go out you don't work you are maybe you."
16776.0,Patient,"can't work. I can't work, you know, the last time I I I tried to get a job, like I flipped out mentally and. I drove straight to Mexico, you know, like and I was just crying I get like anxiety it's embarrassing like I. can't. be like that, at work, and most of this happened when I worked at Clovis Community hospital like them, trying to fire me, you know them like just picking on me and then and."
760.0,Provider,"What did you do, what did you what did you do the hospital and what happened."
16776.0,Patient,"I worked there for 14 years as a security officer. Okay 14 years you know. And when new management comes in, and they don't like you and they try to like single me out, so I got the state. And you know the state was kind of like neutral, but also reprimanded the supervisors and said that they had to. finish this and do that, so they can be fair and they still you know they I felt like I was a whistleblower. You know, and you know this was causing my me to take more medication because everywhere, I kept going, I felt like there are watching me in the cameras and they were. They were because you know my boss would call me in and be like well, what are you doing here what were you doing here and I had every reason to be there because I was writing tickets, I was doing as much as I can, so they don't try to fire me and. When they fired me, you know I got a lawyer and I didn't get as much as I wanted, but you know they did come to a settlement, which tells you that you know i'm not gonna win a within a corporation, you know."
760.0,Provider,"You kind of leaves you home and isolated. Right so is that's, the main problem that you're having right now that and wanting a family life."
16776.0,Patient,"Right, but you know, I have the right to go visit my friends and family. And I confronted her about that you know you don't tell me all the you leave and that's only hurts her number one thing that she goes to me. i'm going to take the kid away from you she's she's I think she's a bitch i'm being honest with you, I ain't gonna sugarcoat anything i'm not gonna lie. You know i'm telling you how I feel you know if I didn't say that, then I would be being fake."
760.0,Provider,"Is this a marriage, that you want to make work. I wish your thought about that."
16776.0,Patient,"I did when the Kovac thing came in and. it's just all going down Hill and. You know my mom she wants me to, of course, like all moms want you to go live with them, but you know in Mexico, but there's nothing for me there, I want to be a part of my kid's life i'm a father, first I can't be not one day without my kids sorry if I want to be a father, you know. And my dad treated me like shit so that traumatized me to not be a jerk to my son."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so Arthur can you can you talk to me about the is that abuse in childhood from your father, it could be just emotional it doesn't necessarily have to be physical or maybe it could be physical so."
16776.0,Patient,"Oh, he would beat my mom long time ago, when I was younger like my son's age. You know. I remember her having a broken nose and. I tried to defend my mom and then he beats me up. They finally got a divorce and when they got a divorce, she threatened to kill her and. Then she got a boyfriend and the boyfriend was like an old high school sweetheart and you know, he was nice to me just to get you know to my mom and. And I originally lived in San Diego but sometimes you know my dad would do drugs and. Like sell caught his sell his car to get drugs and we didn't even have rent money, so we every. Every other month or every two months, I would have to live with my grandpa and Mexico, because you know San diego's right by the border. I remember being my son's age 910 years old crossing the border by myself back and forth, because you know back then there wasn't really wasn't a big deal. I just say American citizen. Because I do have dual citizenship."
760.0,Provider,"So Okay, so your father had a substance abuse problem."
16776.0,Patient,"Oh, he did. He tried to hide it for me, but. You know. I could I I found out. can keep it from everyone that long."
760.0,Provider,and
16776.0,Patient,"Pretty shitty childhood man and. I don't want to pass that cycle to my son that's why I never yell at him. You know, when he does something wrong, you know. I tell him, you know i'm not going to get mad at you, but you know you need to learn this and that i'm just trying to break the cycle, so my my son is a very happy kid and. You know I don't we me and my wife stop yelling at each other, so instead of yelling we just don't talk period. We don't want my son to get traumatized. But i'm trying to figure out what I did wrong, all I would do is just go visit my friend, because if I stay in this House i'm going to go crazy. And she should know better, you know. Oh colby test and colby. I don't I don't know how many times i've took covert tests, you know."

760.0,Provider,"Well, the health records are electronic now so. that's probably why."
16776.0,Patient,"Right, no, I never remember my face, you know, especially the nurses, so you know when I went into the the behavioral care unit at the hospital. They recognized me and they suggested, you know we don't want to put you on hold, or a 5150 and then that they're the they're like social worker came in and she was shocked that I explained her. You know the process down to a TEE. And she she just she knew I you know. She knows why i'm here, you know. there's some people that abuse the system, just because they need a place to stay or he. You know i'm not that you know actually need help, so, but the nurses told me, you know they put a farm on hold or. Then it's going to hurt my record and stuff so. They just you know. I guess sign me out, and you know, they also offered you know, do you want to go through with the process and I started thinking about it and.

16776.0,Patient,"Sometimes I have to go away and see which one is least. damaging right. that's why I always play sports with my kid you know. isn't basketball, and you know when my wife's not around I let him, you know run around with the other kids because that's what kids are supposed to do. You know they go out and my sister in law's kids never ever have played outside before I. know that sounds kind of crazy but it's true and she's a principal at i'm LM elementary school, you know you would think that you know but she's so cycle over this covert thing that."
760.0,Provider,"people get in such a fear response about it there, it hits people in different ways, you know, based on individual personalities."
16776.0,Patient,"You know I you're so depressed or kids are so would they love hanging out with me like when the youngest kid he's. A year younger than my son like he goes oh we're going to your House, and I was like yeah you know and. I watched him, you know I watch him play bass i'm always supervising them because I don't trust anybody, you know they go play football at the park and I see him he's like running around and like God I don't do this at my mom's house and like I that's what they're supposed to do. So no I just tell them, you know don't say nothing I mean if if you say something you never going to be able to play outside and have a normal life. And this, this only happens like maybe. once a week or when they want to drop off the kids here, you know that's fine by me the kid the kid goes crazy when you know she says he's hard to control and stuff no he's not when you treat them like a kid and let them go out and run and stuff he's happy. You know, you would think that a principal would know that by now, you know. I don't know, maybe the fear is blocking or judging."
760.0,Provider,"People like I said, people. fall into that I mean I to me it was it was for me personally, it was a hard thing because I could have gone the fear route, I felt myself going there, but I figured Okay, there has to be balanced, I have to find a way to live I can't just close myself in in a in a in a house. brand so. I coped with it, by doing what I was supposed to do you know distancing mask wearing I got fascinated as soon as I could about boosted as soon as I could. And i'm I tried to be I just like I said I tried to be balanced, but I do notice with a lot of people when they when they isolate it kind of builds a fear. You know, so that. You know I don't know how that's going to help you much because it's. Because you're not the one that's paralyzed with fear you're just kind of living with the effects of that. So if you just. go somewhere, what about if you tried to go somewhere with your wife, could you approach her and. make a plan to go to a bar."
16776.0,Patient,I know she won't go to a park definitely not apart.
760.0,Provider,"Well, where does she go to she just got back from somewhere just now right."
16776.0,Patient,"Oh yeah she'll come here and then go straight to her sisters. they're like. inseparable and. there's nothing wrong with that, but but. Be fair. And she'll take the kid. You know, sometimes the kid doesn't want to go he wants to stay with me but she'll like force them to go. because she thinks, you know. he'll be playing with with this cousin which today, he was playing with this cousin anyway for like two hours you know running around playing basketball but playing football with the other kids. You know, when I want to. know when I was like sometimes like this whole penn democrat, you know, especially with the news like altering it and just making it more scary and stuff you know when I want to laugh i'll just go to CNN see all the. cuckoo's you know just making it worse and. This media thing to you know. I don't take anything seriously, you know this made me. really start paying attention to what I watch because you know when I watched the news you think like the news is going to tell the truth, but. Usually usually the bias, you know, usually they're left or right, so I tend to. You know, pick. Like a news station that's pretty neutral and the only way, you can do that is go on YouTube because YouTube has different types of news, you know. see what all. You know I just. I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"What kind of takes me back to my other question I asked if you wanted to. Go someplace with your wife. Even, how do you do your supermarket shopping, how do you do your necessities. You get a delivered you. Do you go to the store."
16776.0,Patient,"yeah we'll go to the store late at night, you know. But you know."
760.0,Provider,That that's that's very limited.
16776.0,Patient,"very limited yeah. it's kind of sad because i'm like you sustain at home now. I don't even get mad because when I get mad and something else happens, and all this stuff. I think of the consequences, so I just say effort images."
760.0,Provider,But it sounds like you're going along with everything she wants.
16776.0,Patient,"Well yeah because, if I don't then. it's going to cause problems because she's going to keep what she likes to do is nag and nag and nag so I lock myself in a room. she'll like kick it and threaten you know if I don't come out how much it's going to take the kid in that come back and he's he's like that so it's hard to live with a person like that. She doesn't want to do couples counseling you know she thinks that nothing's wrong with her, just like her sister. No."
760.0,Provider,I kind of takes me back to the question that I asked you earlier.
16776.0,Patient,"I know, are you want to be."
760.0,Provider,"No, no, this is a process Arthur. And it's."
16776.0,Patient,"I still want to I feel like i'm frustrating because you're trying to get me to answer question I know i'm going off subject it's because my mind's all whacked out, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Well, you kind of telling me what's going on with you, so I you know i've asked the questions that I needed to ask. But at the end it's you know i'm not you're not here for me i'm here for you that's number one. Number two i'm just questioning because I hear something conflicting things I hear you telling me that you want to be. very unhappy you seem very unhappy in your home very unhappy with your with your your spouse. And then, when I asked, then I asked you do you want to be in the marriage and you said that you're hoping that get better so. I kind of go back to the question, are you sure you want to be in this relationship with this person. Putting your son putting putting your son to the side completely just just thinking about the relationship between only you and her and not taking into account him at all, do you want to be in this relationship."
16776.0,Patient,"I don't know. that's my honest question I don't know. I don't know right now. If I were to say yes, I would be lying to you, if I were to say no, I would be lying to so okay I just don't know that's my honest answer."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, when I appreciate the honest answer I don't expect you to necessarily know. You know. It seems like as far as therapy of things that you can do, and some of the obvious things getting getting out and getting some exercise, would you be free to go out your front door and go on a job or a walk or something, are you going to get tagged for that, too, I."
16776.0,Patient,"Know i've done that, but you know when you do it every day. You know kinda miss hanging out with your friends, you know."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16776.0,Patient,So you know I kind of stopped doing that.
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16776.0,Patient,"Because I got tired I would walk every day like for miles. You know, even when I was in Mexico, I was in a bad part of town, because for my it was called udd guanajuato Mexico, it was like a cartel infested place. I didn't care I didn't care my uncle would be like don't go out for a walk what's wrong with you, I told him like honestly don't care what happens to me, and I would go for long walks and i'll come back and by the grace of God, you know nothing ever happened to me. But you know I feel good when I go for walks and i'm not going to be scared of. Something that you know I know it's Mexico i'm not stupid i'm not going to like go yell at cartel P for look for trouble. I just want to go out for a walk."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so. A lot of the things like. If you went were able to get out with your friends more if you were able to get out an exercise, do you think that would do a lot to help you manage the symptoms of. anxiety and depression."
16776.0,Patient,"It does, because when I go to my friends, and you know we're joking around with each other and i'm helping them with cars, because he has a mobile business, you know and. You know I just hanging out with them and helping them and laughing because we're talking about you know jokes and stuff it, it makes me feel. More and more again okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right, well, I guess, it would be something for that I would want you to come and think about maybe even Journal on. Like, what are the, what are the reasons, what are the reasons that you want to stay in it, when I do, that I would include my son and then, what are the reasons that I don't want to stay and kind of see where you're at with that you know we can't control Colvin I don't know. You know. I don't know if it's going to. I don't think it's going to go away, I don't know for sure, but I don't think it's going to go away so we're gonna have to learn how to deal with it. we're going to have her on how to live with it. And seems like you're vaccinated and boosted."
16776.0,Patient,i've got vaccinated. And for the older people did.
760.0,Provider,"yeah then you've done what you can do. And you know, and you can go out and you can put a mask on your face that's The other thing. and beyond that i've just kind of made peace personally that's how i've dealt I get it, I get it i'm going to do the best I can not do I get it, I get it. that's kind of about for me that was the best balance I could find in my own life but for you, this is not your issue this is this is your wife or your partner's issue. and So. What is it that you want, do you want to continue this relationship or not."
16776.0,Patient,I don't know.
760.0,Provider,"I think you could journal about it but. The reasons why you would want to say, maybe take two pages. These are the reasons I want to be here. These are the reasons I don't want to be here, but it down on paper. Start processing they're. feeling and you don't have to walk for miles and miles are there, but it's really important that you do everything you can and getting out and walking, at least for 30 minutes. would be very useful for you."
16776.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,You think you would be willing to do that too. How you feeling now still depressed.
16776.0,Patient,i'm always gonna be depressed but you know I feel better than I did before.

760.0,Provider,"give it a give it a little bit give it a little bit. We make change sometimes change happens slowly sometimes there's a side to us that resists or blocks or. So give it a little bit, and if we can revisit that again. Next time, you and I thought I want to start focusing in on a treatment plan with you. A little bit more I can I can start teaching you some coping skills, but I just on this conversation that we've had so far it's real important. for you to decide what it is you want, in your life. When it comes to this relationship, because it seems like. Perhaps part of the pressure might be that you're just not living true to. what's important to to you, is it and it's to the extreme you keep saying that she's not fair, like everything is the way she's dictating it and nothing is the way you would like it to be, for your own state of mind your own mental health and emotional health does that sound. Right."
16776.0,Patient,yeah.
