207.0,Provider,"hold on you, you sound oh. yeah."
3263.0,Patient,"Okay, so uh. So what was that. Monday to like okay so actually started moving on Monday. and Sunday but. I suppose Sunday. or Monday or Tuesday. And kind of end up, it was just me. My wife and, like the baby was like late in the like the liver on were like fusion police to clean the floor, it was just sad situation man and then whenever I was doing whatever I was doing it was easy finding people to help you move. It was like oh you got to buy them a little bit of this that and the more. But. I don't know I seem like when you doing good stuff is difficult."
207.0,Provider,What do you mean so you have you needed to move from where you are.
3263.0,Patient,"I did move any was hard so hard. my sister and my wife. got into it over some so okay. my sister he jokes and stuff. comes down to is causing problems and stuff. On the wonderful drunk in terms of on covert and she her my wife went out and what doesn't drink and she my sister grabbed the baby in. Without my wife's knowledge she's like Oh, let me see the baby what my stores talk and my wife's talking to one of our friends and stuff and she hasn't seen the years. She grabs the baby so i'm just gonna walk around with her and she walks around with it and I guess the next morning my wife footsteps and sees. that she doesn't put my daughter on social media all shows comes to face, and she does so she sees her on social media on somebody else snapchat like it was like a grand opening on. Some places and somebody decided to record the baby, but you can tell i've seen the new that the personal record and I don't see drunk or she made in production, but she did that, to my wife got upset I was like you know, like to. Be around my daughter normal because you're irresponsible. And I guess they got into it over that but, so I asked my brother likes to help me move, and when he moved our last year me my wife and my sister obviously all of us, helped him move. And what was it like a month pregnant or something two months pregnant. She wasn't listening to herself, she was little small stuff and I don't know I don't even know. But. So we have them moving, and so my sister was like my brother in law said he would help me Saturday I. ended up getting a u haul I was back to go pick up the whole Sunday good thing I call them and I was literally heading there, and he was a man he's like our is our got bad news like bro your sister doesn't want me. What."
207.0,Provider,sister's husband.
3263.0,Patient,"yeah my husband tells me that my sister does no one has been helping us because of what because of what my what my sister she can see the kid normal or whatever, because. Like. She. She comes around like you know your mother baby. Baby she don't like a lot of retro stuff but, and I feel like my wife was wrong for saying saying you know, like to see her like you know, like to be around her, she she should be handled the look different but. I didn't understand why my sister would tell her husband, not to help us move when she knew that was the only person I had helping me I just I mean I didn't see that coming. So that threw me off, and then one of my other friends, I was supposed to help me he made up of bullshit excuse. I helped him move so just made me realize like okay that's, the only thing that I thought I had left. But you know how to see catch the President, when he was like only one left and. Hello yeah."
207.0,Provider,i'm here.
3263.0,Patient,Can you see me.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, you had a video call."
3263.0,Patient,"So that's when I realized, I guess, I don't got many friends in there, then I got this problem my sister is just. bad news all around but but I ended up moving, but it was really hard really hard I did it by myself, I took a Dolly and I was literally putting stuff on dollies and put it on even a Washington dry and all of that TV couches output on medallia doing Obama stuff. Until until my art, my friends, my my wife's. And friends boyfriend. came and helped us, and he doesn't even know me man and he doesn't like he the guy he wants to be friends and he's a man, I just want to be friendly to other he's he's a little bit different you know. i'm not sure like you don't I don't I think he drinks, but he seemed pretty cool, though I don't know he just he after he helped. Halfway through he got tired he gave up it's kind of like a bigger do. You can really stand on its feet too long, I thought. He helped me a load and after a while you get tired, but it was the gesture offer to give them some money I forced you to want to take up our first I force it on them because. Because I don't want that because I felt like he went out of his way to do that, you know."
207.0,Provider,That and then.
3263.0,Patient,And then I dropped my phone in the toilet.
207.0,Provider,"giving you a wonderful time they're just being. So what was your. Okay, so let's go back to your sister was your sister intoxicated."
3263.0,Patient,When when when she took the baby.
207.0,Provider,yeah she was intoxicated.
3263.0,Patient,"Like she said she wasn't like all the way I think she was like tipsy or she wants us all to be gone, but. I don't think she did it like on purpose not thinking or nothing like that think she did it without thinking and it's a lot of behavior like that you know if she comes in the House, and she just. Without washing our hands wash total for sort of wash your hands like she gets offended we tell her wash your hands on like, why are you going to find it so fucking baby. it's cold going on you'd be hanging out with a bunch of people like David can die from there, like you know understand how serious, that is. And then she would get mad at me or whatever, and then feel like unless you think stuff personal that she shouldn't take personally, you know. If somebody tells me to do something right i'm not going to take a personal, but if I feel like nitpicking I am going to take it personal. But it wasn't like it was nitpicking and stuff and I never really seen up until my wife be like why you don't take sides because i'm not going to take sides, because one of y'all gonna be mad. If I feel like it's not big enough for me to get in between them know about like you may be that big situation I should have got in between that but I didn't. Because I felt like. I."
207.0,Provider,"felt like my wife, are you all right. So why you felt like you should have gotten so there's a difference between there's a there's a distinctive difference between taking sides. or identifying because I think naturally one always believes that. That we should take sides okay i'm your wife, you should be on my side but i'm your sister, you should be on my side i'm your friend, you should be on my side and that's a stranger, why are you taking their side, and I think, naturally, we all believe so. We always think we're right in our own eyes right, we always think that what we're saying what we're doing is right, but then it takes a neutral party that takes that is. tries to stay objective takes a very unbiased approach and it looks at both sides and calls are both persons on where they're wrong so two rooms as a maker right and so therefore each person has to take the responsibility of how the breakdown in communication happened and so. In the case of your sister and your in your wife. Where do you think that the breakdown or the Miss misunderstanding in their communication happen. going away."
3263.0,Patient,So. I guess after the big thing happen. They are Kim.
207.0,Provider,"yeah no i'm saying wait okay so let's start from the baby thing because you said that maybe with the baby thing you should have gotten involved, why do you feel like you should have gotten involved were in all of that you think the breakdown in communication was."
3263.0,Patient,"Okay, so after the baby thing happened, they want to hook a spot that night was smokes and Booker and. yeah so my stuff and then my sister brought one of her friends, she brought one of her friends with her and she was also intoxicated and my sister and her friends were fighting. And, and like arguing and stuff like that, like being very drunk and belligerent and then they get out the car on the freeway a whole bunch of stuff happened. My sister's intoxicated all of a little feelings coming back if she doing all this unnecessary stuff. And then her and my wife get into it over the word stuff that she did like she was trying to force my wife to leave the girl on the freeway. And wife wasn't willing to do that, and she wasn't drinking, I told her why don't you go out to people that are drinking and that happened, and the next morning. She sees that video on snaps and I think that's just threw her over you know and then and and that's what I think I think that's what that's the. I don't think it was like miscommunication was like you say that's what threw her over and she just felt like she was justified in in. and telling her the baby stuff like she was wrong like she's all the stuff that she did that night that she wakes up the next morning, but the biggest thing was already happened, prior to them going out so i'm like if you were mad about something like you found out about it but. The next day she found out about it, but it already happened before y'all went out so she she took that, in consideration and then. I think the hardest that's a little bit wrong you can't tell somebody like you can't tell my sister unless she's like. I will she do was like careless and reckless but she didn't like I don't think she would intention to ever put on her Nice in danger not like that. So I don't think like it was her place to say she can see her, she should have just told me, you know, like a. i'll tell you like this can be around and whatever, but even if she come around I thought I like even if she can run your supervisor don't color texture and. A boss and stuff like that, like don't wake up somebody who had a horrible night to to to something like that you know, like telling them."
207.0,Provider,"No, are they. Are they pretty good friends or something."
3263.0,Patient,"They got they got really, really close. And then they fight over some dumb stuff and they get really causing the fight over some dumb stuff and it's."
207.0,Provider,Like it's more emotional. It sounds to me like they're both in their feelings.
3263.0,Patient,"Big time and then just my sister just I think if she doesn't drink, everything is called a great if she drinks there every night she drinks and they end up. hanging out or whatever sit always goes to the left. And then the next day or next couple days later, whatever they make up and it back together or sometimes it's and and then they slowly start hanging out again and everything smooth. Because my sister she I think she got up she I know she got a call problem but. But uh but sometimes. I don't know man Sometimes I feel like she's wrong Sometimes I feel like my wife is taking stuff overboard a little bit. So, and I just don't want to get in between because i'm like Okay, so if I get in between do I want to find all my wife at home or do I want to just stay out of it and just try to mediate things whenever I can sometimes I tried."
207.0,Provider,It does your sister does your wife not feel like you're taking your being. So she feel that you're not necessarily being fair.
3263.0,Patient,"And I don't like I don't even have a problem, my wife, I have a problem, my sister because I didn't I technically I didn't but I didn't tell him like. My my sister text me like Oh, why would your wife say that to me, whatever stuff like that I look he didn't even really respond well as for like listen i'm like a match let's blow over whatever and she's she felt like."
207.0,Provider,"The me ask you this, do you have a hard time do you find that you have a hard time. Because again, it sounds like this is just girls fighting. Is it that you um. How can I say this now. Is it that you, you can't tell them because in a situation like this it really just sounds a lot like you just kind of saying hey listen. If you guys are fighting friends fight all the time right. Friends sisters whatever however they see themselves. Were friends were sisters, whatever it is that you guys are just arguing with each other and we both know y'all got its own blow over. Then, keep it in between y'all why bring me into it like that's not fair for you to breed now all of a sudden it's my wife now all of a sudden it's this now all of a sudden. You know, tell your sister that she can't be around her nice well this that that also doesn't sound like. it's a if you're using the relationship or the connection to your advantage right now in comparison to just saying hey listen y'all are friends and y'all getting into squabbles Why am I, why are you bringing me into this. yeah that's what it really sounds like it just sounds like two sisters fighting and now they're trying to get you involved because. you're not coming in ground."
3263.0,Patient,And in the mood thing just the move thing just thrown overboard because it was it was like.
207.0,Provider,Like your community and your background looks. You bought a house.
3263.0,Patient,"know this one i'm working at and we're just all i'm not electrician so what we're doing right now so i'm just working on building out Sana. My lunch break to set like 12. minutes only meeting that was available sats ticket, so I had to really walk away so I don't get in trouble. you're."
207.0,Provider,A new Community that you're building.
3263.0,Patient,"Yes, condominiums slash apartments. And then we. Have over here and some guys over there are doing some other stuff."
207.0,Provider,So it's it's. It sounds to me Abdi that in order for you to take a neutral stance it's it's addressing both your sister and your wife and just like putting things into perspective and not use the the baby as a.
3263.0,Patient,Whole yeah that was. That was bad.
207.0,Provider,you're using the baby as a tool now from a general standpoint like. your wife ha.
3263.0,Patient,i'm sorry and then losing the movers the tool.
207.0,Provider,"you're using. yeah it was. Good. Yes, and I think it's addressing both of them about what they did. Is because, if it is naturally from from okay so like you said, if you both come to an agreement that you don't want the baby to be put on social media or to be put. Their face on social media that's making it that very clear to her that hey listen don't put her I don't want her face I don't want anything on social media I don't want my child on social media."
3263.0,Patient,"She already knew that and know what the other thing was it was like people were touching her. It was like two three different people were just touching on so really upset her because she's like she's like what if, most people got covert or whatever, and I thought wow even enough environment like that. To begin with, investments are afraid of, but then, when she was like outstanding toner by myself and then we were. We were keeping separation and stuff and then she told me that she was going to take the baby. Like for a second hidden can't tell what the reason was and then she felt like her intention was to go quarter and because because, like as soon as she took her, she was gone for like. She was gone for like like not even not even three minutes, and the next month or two exceptions, video so she felt like her intention was to put on the video, but she just forgot that she forgot that are. Like I don't know if she forgot her she's hipster whatever happened is she just got blown out of proportion and then. And then I did kind of agree with her on the on the because there was there was like three four people like touching her cheek and stuff like that. And we don't let people come around her like that people, especially people that they're like men involved in our life and stuff like strangers and stuff like that. We keep them this way now people always tell the Cuban whatever when you guys walk right away, I walk away from the model walk towards them Thank you nice move it if people want to stop and stuff like. That tiger comes. Time so. And I also think it was that the fight the fight they have is what made it even worse, I mean when he went out that night stuff that happens, a lot of stuff that I don't have enough time. telling me there's a lot of stuff that happening in this you write the big thing was like you tell her that using the baby as a tool was."
207.0,Provider,If you guys were out smoking and you're drinking or whatever and and it was. It was a thing that you guys were doing together now because an argument came up.
3263.0,Patient,"My wife doesn't. Smoke tobacco did was daytime it was the time and it went to a grand opening and my sister decided to drink. Like like she stopped somewhere and she grabbed something, and she drinking, you know, like you drink a really fast when she got her seemed like it seemed like. Every time they go somewhere, she has to drink and and that's what I was that's what I listen man if its amino every time she drinks you guys have a problem, why you. Why, you can enable her know you can't like Whenever she put in she asked me. Because like sometimes she will ask for some money so for husband noticed drinking or whatever he doesn't know that account cheeky, but I want to do a $30 for dollar because he knows, she just something he doesn't want to drink me. So so i'm still call now."
207.0,Provider,"I mean again again, you know it sounds like Okay, they got it they had a squabbling whatever that squabble is. But then to include the baby and to include you and and everything has to be to remain in perspective, you understand and ella was given the example of. Even if I mean okay yeah, you said that she doesn't drink she doesn't smoke, or whatever your wife. But then it's one of those things where Okay, if your sister in law does it's not something that's new to you it's not that you've said, if you verbalize to her and say hey listen. i'm I know that you're drinking you smoke, but when i'm going out with you, I will I will prefer that you not engage in it, or if she says hey come with me so you can be the designated driver home. It means that you're completely aware. Of when he gets intoxicated this is how she conducts or so until you're completely aware of that, so now saying okay you're not allowed to be around the baby that that is an unfair. statement because you were well aware of what she's capable of when she's intoxicated. You all went out to have fun and now that you both got into a squabble and why she was intoxicated she acts, the way she normally acts when she gets intoxicated you're well aware of that so keep it within."
3263.0,Patient,"that's exactly what I told her about you know you know what happened, she loved her excuses like I thought she changed about things were different, it was daytime you know, like, I can understand if it was like later that day, shoes, we fucked up, but she like. I don't like it just felt like the fight and that night was the reason why she told her. The baby thing like like. I think it was that in Alaska and it will show up the next morning she seemed that last run she does that, like if he gets upset children some rational shit you know what to cut off time you. know and and I seen her do that. possible. Hello."
207.0,Provider,"yeah I mean again, you know. You taking the. A more objective approach in all of it and you just be upfront and just saying you know, at the end of the day, you're my wife or the mother of my children my child. She is my sister, and while I want peace to rain amongst all of us, and I want us to continue to have a relationship that we do. But both of and it's sitting down and talking to both of them and saying you both have to be fair in your in your argument, and when I get involved in when I don't because. i'm certain you're not going to sit back and allow your wife to be outright disrespectful to your sister likewise you're not going to sit back and allow your sister to be outright disrespectful. to your wife, because then, if such as the case and it becomes a toxic relationship, then you just have to say hey listen. you're my sister and your my wife and if we if if it's a situation where we just have to find that the different ways to communicate and interact that's what we'll have to do, but as it stands right now. it's just one of those situations where hey you know if this is what it's going to have to be, but before you get to that extreme given the situation and have at hand, given the interaction between both of."
3263.0,Patient,"You know what I told you don't you don't think we're there I look you feel like we're really there because, at first, the big thing happened. And then the move thing and one person is highly upset about the baby thing, and the other one is highly upset by the move and cheaper like if you do care about the baby, why would you why would you stop."
207.0,Provider,"women get very emotional, this is going to say to you, women get very emotional they're they're in their emotions a lot, and then they can stick it in they can carry on a crush. For a little long for a very long time, where men is just like a whatever move on. And this is my question to you what you know about your sister and what you know about your wife, do you think that this could carry very long, or do you think that they will eventually. kissing makeup let's use that term let's see."
3263.0,Patient,"I think it's possible. it's possible, but I just feel like. I feel like, even if they do kiss on makeup except the horse is gonna happen so. Is it where you have to this is where you're going to mention I see."
207.0,Provider,"This is where the intervention comes in you, because this is the truth, you have to know both of them, and you have to know what they're both capable of. And yes, it is upsetting because here, it is that you guys are we're moving and you really needed the assistance. um and So yes, your wife, you and your wife could be upset about the whole thing and your wife can be justified when he says she's upset about because, then this is. i'm you know going into protective mode and your sister violating that, to some degree, while it may not have been intentional. Because Maybe she had been intoxicated at the time, but like you said to for her for her to feel as if she would intentionally put her Nice in harm's way, you know that that's not the truth. So there was something that there was like you said. hmm."
3263.0,Patient,So.
207.0,Provider,"it's so right now, your emotions and and you, but you got to call them both out on it right now y'all are allowing your emotions to dictate everything. And so, while they're both allowing their emotions to dictate everything it's coming it comes to that place where you have to call both of them. they're allowing your emotions, because I can understand how your sister may feel for you to think that I would put my niece in harm's way. for you to think that I will do anything back to to my niece that's hurtful. While your your your wife is saying we've always been there for you we've helped you, and here it is that we really needed the assistance and because you were being spiteful. You turn around and we had to do it all ourselves and so again it's coming to that place that both of them have to see where they both were wrong in their actions. And in their thought process so to rights don't make a wrong, I mean to me two wrongs don't make a right two wrongs don't make a right. So it's making both of them see hey both of you are wrong, and how you're handling the situation both of you are very wrong and how you're granted in their eyes they're justified in their feelings, but at the same time. me trying to get back at you and you're trying to get back at me it's not what is it going how's it going to be helpful how's it going to allow us to move on in peace and harmony."
3263.0,Patient,"yeah I just think they need to make up that they don't need to be no more, because I feel like this, or something worse so or something worse is going to happen, especially when I call us involved."
207.0,Provider,"But then that's the intro This is where so having that conversation in saying hey I think you guys need to to address the issue, because both of your feelings are justified i'm not going to minimize both of your feelings. You both are taking are going over the top, with how you're handling it, you have to also think suggesting that none of that they're no longer friends, you have to think about the concert the backlash that will have on you and the overall. Family guys are very close and you guys do things together it's going to it was it's going to eventually put a strain on the overall. atmosphere and this form of Community that you're creating because at the end of the day, this is not just a friend it's your sister your understand and so when it comes on to family gatherings and different things um. So you have to you have to you have to look at it from that aspect, the other piece of it is um you know when it comes on to. You know, like you said you guys just don't need to be. Friends anymore, or what have you if they just really need to keep things in perspective, keep everything in for keep it for what it is and don't make it more than it is. It really truly is keeping it for what it is and not go all over the place. For what it's it's not and it just really sounds like two friends gotten the argument and they're both being spiteful to each other that it simply sounds like that. yellow just okay y'all have friends and y'all are being spiteful let's see each other and i'm not minimizing how each of you feel you're being spiteful to each other and that's not cool at all. And so, and I think that's just kind of moving forward, I, this is what I would encourage it is having that conversation with both your wife and your sister. And just say you know over everything they have formulated a friendship. And whether it was, through you, and her getting together or it was a friendship that pre existed before you and her got together, whatever the went wherever and whenever the friendship started. is like is, this is it something petty as this worth losing for it's worth you guys losing this friendship in this relationship that you guys have, is it really worth it. And, and I, and I encourage you to proceed in caution and how you address the matter, because at the end of the day, this is not just a random friend, this is actually family you understand. And you don't you don't want it to you, you don't want to create to continue to create this division, because at the end of the day, family is family and you're always going to need them."
3263.0,Patient,yeah. And so you have to say.
207.0,Provider,"To say y'all don't need to be friends, I wouldn't be so rushed to say that I would say hey listen. You know, we need to work through this and it's just keep it everything in perspective for what it is and the other piece of it, what I would suggest to you, aside from all of that is for you, having your own. struggles and and and and deficiencies and what you're working on, is telling your sister hey you know, like listen when you drink it's not good for you or for anybody else around you. And so you need to work on. hmm."
3263.0,Patient,yeah for sure definitely.
207.0,Provider,And I think that that is a is this an older or younger sister.
3263.0,Patient,he's. Four years older.
207.0,Provider,So.
3263.0,Patient,"Okay, almost four years."
207.0,Provider,"So we need to, we need to pull out the big brother."
3263.0,Patient,"seemed like. She. She sees me like, no, no. Time just emotional senior like that no longer know."
207.0,Provider,"You are who you are and you're always be just because it listen as his she's getting older, like you said we're living in crazy times right now. And so, people are just you know siblings are turning against each other, like everybody's turning against each other for what reason only got one can say. And so you know it just comes to this place right now, where. You know, you know what you know whether all you can do is give out the information if she refuses to listen or she refuses to add here, you know you've done your part. And if the relationship between her and your wife or between you and her goes awry simply because she wants to continue on the path that she's been on. Then that's something that that's a decision that she's made, but you can sit, you can go down saying hey at least I tried at least are trying to make amends, at least, are trying. continue on this path of drinking and and not recognizing what is doing to you listen it's it's not gonna it's not going to end well. So. Let me, I have my other client. Look at your chart for a second. Happy I you know what i'm just gonna say what did you remember our appointment today Abdi. What made you remember our appointment that day."
3263.0,Patient,"I set a reminder, I sent a calendar. So. going off."
207.0,Provider,Okay i'm glad. All right.

207.0,Provider,"Listen you gotta do your drug screen. Oh, you gotta do your drugs."
3263.0,Patient,"Okay, so wonder if any come yet."
207.0,Provider,"You listen it, saying that the last time you did a drug test was back in July."
3263.0,Patient,"August I did an August, he said he updated it what's wrong with this guy's name is mark. He said it was all good."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I sent a message, but you didn't even if you didn't an August, you didn't do one in September."
3263.0,Patient,"yeah because of what he said was they never opted in the system, so they never sent in the mail. I don't know like I don't know what's going to keep in."
207.0,Provider,touch her and i'm going to send a message to him i'll send a message to him to find out what's going on.
3263.0,Patient,"He updated the August one so, can you update down one."
207.0,Provider,yeah i'll send i'll send them a message I send them a message.
3263.0,Patient,"And, and he said he said he updated mature and he said he was going to send out a new. One so I can do something I don't have you know. And I was wondering why never came.
