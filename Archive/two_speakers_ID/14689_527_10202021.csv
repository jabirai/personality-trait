527.0,Provider,yeah did you guys eat at a restaurant or did you guys eat at home. home okay. yeah is that easier for you than a restaurant like not having to feel like there's lots of eyes on you in the restaurant.

527.0,Provider,How are you doing with meals since you're by yourself.
14689.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,Is this was a this was a change in your meal plan week when mm hmm.
14689.0,Patient,"it's been all right, I guess. i've been able to explore the kitchen a little bit more without my parents being there and. worrying about. them like watching me and. So i've been able to kind of. come up with more ideas for those three shirts, rather than two but."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14689.0,Patient,"So, been a little bit difficult during the three. No more. comfortable with the two. Right, I mean. it's been all right."
527.0,Provider,what's what's been helpful as far as just being able to explore in the kitchen like just being able to process through that for yourself. what's what kind of thoughts or feelings have been coming up without.
14689.0,Patient,All the overwhelming. I haven't thought too much about it. And i've been. Trying to come up with something for things that are easy. I don't think too much rather.
527.0,Provider,"I know, last week we talked about just how intense the eating disorder thoughts have been. what's like this week, been like since there's been some adjustments and challenges like would you say Z you know zero none at all 10 like 100% of the time of the day. What do you think they're at this week."
14689.0,Patient,like an A.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so they're still pretty high."
14689.0,Patient,"mm hmm. I mean my parents, not being here that's the big distraction that they don't have. Right now they're telling our today. But. I mean i've been coping know i've been keeping myself busy with the like house. chores and stuff like that. More obviously. Normal."
527.0,Provider,"So how are we doing on our homework from last week, as far as. starting to delve into some emotional recognition."
14689.0,Patient,"Well, I was hard to do because my parents were."
527.0,Provider,OK.
14689.0,Patient,OK okay they're. able to. But um. I don't know I guess I just been. still struggling with.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14689.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't have that many. emotion hey guys. I don't know, maybe. I guess what Carson. I feel. Like. Like excitable like I guess. I feel like my. i'm like automatically happier when i'm with them. Okay, so I think I. Like can recognize that sure and it's almost it's kind of hard to this almost like an. unfamiliar it's almost uncomfortable because. Like I only really feel that when i'm with him so it's kind of like I don't really know how do I deal with it. Okay, so someone's like out of body like fake feeling, but I know I get on but."
527.0,Provider,"I like that description in a. yeah okay. So if. So it's kind of like your do you I mean do you feel like you're present with Carson or do you feel like you're kind of like. kind of like with him, but kind of observing."
14689.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"from outside yourself. yeah okay. Okay. So what's that like then like. To like know that you're not fully with yourself and with him. Like you want to be, but. You know it's unfamiliar so let's talk a little bit more about that, like what that's like. Because you said something to me or not quite sure how to."
14689.0,Patient,"Well, I think a lot of it is like the. ne ne even though we've been together for so long, I feel like. And I know it's not true, I feel like he expects me. To like. be some kind of way I guess. And because of the eating disorder i'm always like very tired and I have like a very low like extra hey. I was kind of like exhausted and. Not. And then I start off with like the eating. Just like the normal relationship stuff I struggle with a lot, so I get really paranoid, and in my head about it, while we're together. They don't want to like. say anything. or anything. it's just like."
527.0,Provider,"what's the paranoid about is that, like just if i'm not measuring up to expectations, you know he's going to leave or."
14689.0,Patient,yeah go.
527.0,Provider,"So, how would you like to maybe challenge that piece Anna because I know. You know it definitely sounds like he's a very important person to you and you guys like you said, have been together for some time."
14689.0,Patient,"And I have been I just kind of push away. Those thoughts than. Just like remember that. he's like been with me through like the worst of the worst so like if he was gonna leave, he would have done it by now i'm just kind of standing up for myself and knowing that. Like. It i'm not like thinking totally clearly. and it's like a two way street kind of thing and. Just. don't know. And I I do really well like pushing myself a little bit of putting myself in like uncomfortable situations, but not like bad or anything just. kind of. Pushing my energy a little bit and. Killing normal relationship thing. Because I know it'll pay off."
527.0,Provider,"I guess one of my thoughts, is, I mean, are you feeling, or do you think like Carson and your parents have just kind of thrown the towel in and they're just kind of letting you do your thing because. they're tired of challenging it."
14689.0,Patient,yeah. So they don't blame them.
527.0,Provider,So they're just kind of given into the eating disorder to. wow. yeah what's what's that like then Anna to know that for yourself like thank.
14689.0,Patient,You now my parents were worried and they can still try to. help. here and there. Carson is just kind of like. I think he's more like annoyed with it. I mean. i'm an adult so I can't like rely on them or anything.
527.0,Provider,"Do you do, you need them to put their foot down more for you like. Like you, Anna not the eating disorder, but do you Anna need them to put the foot down and say you know this this behavior is not okay like we're not allowing the eating disorder to be in the House we're not allowing the eating disorder to be in our relationship. Because i'm wondering if. Your strength is so weak. That. You need that support to help fight together."
14689.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,Because. Oh go ahead i'm sorry.
14689.0,Patient,I just. wanted to all my on. No one's under. Somebody else's I guess.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, because why you try and do it so so much on your own."
14689.0,Patient,I don't want to burden them okay.
527.0,Provider,What would you be burdened with.
14689.0,Patient,Like they're stressed and. Like. emotion and. They have their own stuff to do so.
527.0,Provider,"I mean you're the one obviously doing the work, but how can they be sharing that support with you and the end the fight with you. Like, how can you let them in to do that."
14689.0,Patient,and talk to them or I guess.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I think it still goes back to you, letting yourself be vulnerable with your emotions to like recognizing that. You know you've got them so tucked in your little compartment here that you know anytime they start to kind of come out they seem really out of control, because they're probably a lot more. aggressively coming out versus more assertively in an identifiable like because because you're still confused like how what what is this, you know, is this finger is this frustration is it your stability is it sadness, is it anxiety like you're still trying to sort that out, and so. letting that box kind of open, you know gradually. and letting letting them experience some of those emotions with you, with you as well as you experiencing those so that feels more safe to you."
14689.0,Patient,yeah that'll take a lot of practice.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And maybe it's just practicing you. Being okay with your emotions first. Like just letting yourself feel things and not just kind of checking out hovering over yourself. mm hmm. Yes, because we have to build the strength backup in you, to be able to you know, use the tools that help regulate that for you. Look here. We got some it looks like on. The 11th so that would have been. Last Monday, right now. yeah. Last Monday, so those were from me see the date. or sideways look at them sideways. Okay, so these would have been from Friday the eighth. Those are the last ones that we have looks like. Do you have some since then."
14689.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. I haven't seen him yet so usually amanda lets us know when those come in and send it and sends a copy of them to us but. yeah I haven't seen him from last week, then. Are you thinking about. yeah. So what are we going to challenge ourself on as far as the homework assignment."
14689.0,Patient,Like wait what.
527.0,Provider,we're still working on the emotion.
14689.0,Patient,"Well, since my parents will be back."
527.0,Provider,Are you going to see Carson this weekend.
14689.0,Patient,yeah well yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,Are you up for a challenge with him to kind of challenge that trying to try and get yourself kind of more present with him. Does he does he understand or recognize that that happens when you guys are together. So what does what does he do when he kind of notice you checking out or not being present.
14689.0,Patient,Be more affectionate and positive and. positive experiences and. My. exclamation. Like asking.
527.0,Provider,What should he be asking instead of what's wrong.
14689.0,Patient,"Because I think you can, I think you can beat around the bush on that one."
527.0,Provider,"I think I think you know what to think you know what to say to kind of appease your family and and Carson so. I want to push I want to push that with you. And is really, really saying you know what's going on, like."
14689.0,Patient,I guess what are you thinking. feeling.
527.0,Provider,"Because I know because I know those are going to be things that push your buttons because you're trying to figure out what you're feeling, but I think we need to keep challenging you on that to like. You know what what am I feeling like what is my thought and if I had to put a feeling to that what would the feeling be you know, for example. i'm feeling fat fat it's not a feeling but i'm feeling fat So what is the feeling that i'm having that attaches to fat. Like my feeling uncomfortable and my feeling vulnerable and I feeling overwhelmed like what like, if I had to attach a feeling to that word what would that be or words, it could be, it could be several to."
14689.0,Patient,Probably all of them.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. And so what do I want to do with those feelings, you know how did those feelings impact and. You know, not just stuff them away and avoid them, but what do I want to do with those feelings. and not use behaviors to cope with them."
14689.0,Patient,"I mean a lot of times if i'm feeling that way i'll like Benjamin Carson and i'll be like. Like kind of just like you're crazy not like saying it like that, but just like. reminding me how likely it is. That i'm not. i'm not thinking rationally."
527.0,Provider,"Can you hear that from him like D, do you and I hear that, or does the eating disorder get in and deflect all of that. Is there something better, he could say, because I know that I know that responses like oh you're not fat now come on you know responses like that aren't as effective because. That genuinely maybe how you're feeling and seeing yourself too. I mean that's through the eating disorder eyes so it's very distorted."
14689.0,Patient,"Yes, he can be a little more comforting that I know that he's just kind of like."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, my mom. Okay, so this is this is going to be your opportunity to start using your voice then Anna so what I want you to maybe challenge yourself on is maybe having a conversation with him saying. And maybe just given give a couple examples you know kind of start small. I mean you can add more if you want, but maybe it is starting with. You know I want I want us to work on, I mean do you feel like he's the safest person to to. To push some of these challenges of emotions."
14689.0,Patient,mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,"Because I was gonna say, if not, then we need to like find someone that you know whether that's your mom your dad or a friend or somebody else just to kind of practice but. You know, but if you feel like you want to you know he's the person that you want to try to work on that to really push some of this like not just be kind of complacent with letting the eating disorder, be the bully in the relationship. And bully over both of you, so you know, maybe it would be like. Because you brought up some good examples. You know what about saying. I want us to start having some I want i'm going to start challenging myself on identifying emotions and I need your help to do that and here's what I want us to work on what would be some some. Maybe a couple things that conversations you guys could start with that you feel like would be. Like that tends to kind of come up or you know that that you that you just said, you know he's just sick of hearing this So what are some what are, maybe a couple of those conversations that that we could maybe challenge on."
14689.0,Patient,"Well, if I. Like maybe challenge myself, all the way with them afterwards is i'm feeling vulnerable i'll ask him to do like did I eat too much. And that's kind of my way of saying like i'm uncomfortable. And then that plan is not going to be like. No, I didn't play. Video and. Okay night. And then he'll be like I more than you."
527.0,Provider,"Okay. So, probably it didn't really go in the direction you want it to go in it kind of."
14689.0,Patient,me kind of.
527.0,Provider,"kind of gets dismissed it sounds like a really what's what you're looking for so for you it's going to be really being direct like I I need you to ask me. You know what i'm feeling, or if you recognize, you know you look uncomfortable and or you look like something's on your mind, or you know. You know what are you feeling right now, like are those kind of maybe some probing questions he can, and maybe it's maybe a. You know, writing them out for him to so that he can you know just kind of remind himself and and just review those for himself, so that you know you guys can practice that at times. And not and not giving in, like not letting not being okay with i'm fine i'm fine you know, like that's kind of your COP out with your eating disorders, so you know, maybe it's not being you know him him or your parents saying okay that's not that's not an answer, like what are you feeling."
14689.0,Patient,i'll just be on.
527.0,Provider,"It is going to be hard Anna but, but I also know that that you can do it, I mean I have confidence and that you can do it, but it is going to be hard because it's different. But your voice matters too, and I want you to see that it matters. Because again we have to build that that strength up for you. Thank you you're eating disorders just warn you know its way weighing you down. And I can tell there's a lot of things going on in that head of yours, that you want to talk about that. you're having you're not quite sure how do I, how do I open my mouth and let somebody really hear and see what's going on."
14689.0,Patient,I mean like I said it's just like exhausting so it's easier to just. face them I guess. But at the same time I don't even know at or what. And feeling yeah.
527.0,Provider,"But I also want to remind you of your you know first year of recovery one word that you described was being free, and so I kind of want to bring that back to. You know, if you allow yourself to kind of let go of some things like you can be free, like you can really live up to that word for yourself."
14689.0,Patient,yeah just gonna say.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I think I think you're just going to have to keep reminding yourself I you know. it's it may not work, the first time may not work, the second time but i'm going to keep doing it until I really hear my voice like and really. allow myself to connect with some emotions because. It may stir up some emotions as you're doing this, too, because you're not doing you know not doing behaviors. To cope. Like you're using your voice to say what you feel."
14689.0,Patient,yeah. I guess i'm just kind of done a certain way for so long that. Breaking that cycle.
527.0,Provider,"I mean you can always go back to it like I said I mean you can always go back to you know closing yourself off and shutting down and staying with your eating disorder. I mean that's always an option but you're here, and you know so. Maybe give yourself, an opportunity to see something different, and try something different, even though it's a little uncomfortable. Maybe try being more present with Carson and see what that experience how that experience is different. than just kind of trying to fake it. That makes me sad for you. And for him, you know he's not getting to have all of you. i'm guessing That would be a pretty amazing feeling to have."
14689.0,Patient,me my mom is one man. was like. A like that she misses her Anna. Like the more. outgoing not isolating session.
527.0,Provider,"I mean is that, who you feel like you really are or are you. trying to figure out who you are without your eating disorder."
14689.0,Patient,"No, I mean I know what she means by. me like before. All that. again. Trying to like get her back."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean it's do you feel like that was that was more of who you were."
14689.0,Patient,you're eating disorder.
527.0,Provider,What do you miss most about yourself.
14689.0,Patient,My energy I would. Like. To use my family and. enjoy the holidays and.
527.0,Provider,"So is it worth trying to fight for those parts of you to come back. Okay. What questions do you have, as far as like challenges, or anything else, we need to put together as far as you know, things you want to you know kind of guide and direct person in. or things that might get in the way that we need to put a plan in place."
14689.0,Patient,"I mean, I think I know how to and. it's like. it's like I. want to know how to."
527.0,Provider,So where's the follow through yeah okay okay.
14689.0,Patient,"Just pushing myself. I know, like come up with like i'm fine and. But not knowing the outcome of digging deeper and like explaining moore's. A little bit more intimidating because they don't know that."
527.0,Provider,"And maybe that's maybe that's the way to approach the conversation with Carson and maybe it maybe it's saying you know i'm. i'm i'm going to do this challenge with you and i'm not sure what's going to happen, but I know I need to do it, to be able to connect more with myself to be able to connect more with you and be more honest with how i'm feeling and how i'm doing. Because that's going to give me strength to fight the eating disorder. And not just. You know, let let it be okay in our relationship. And if it's you know if it's as simple as you know, I just I may just need you to give me a hug or hold my hand or just listen and not necessarily say anything you know those those may be some things that you need to maybe think about to like what you might need in those moments."
14689.0,Patient,"Now, I think I do that with him sometime. you read about and."
527.0,Provider,"Because it's not about him fixing anything for you or you know doing this for you, I mean you're you're like I said you're doing the work, but you know he can walk beside you in this too and and be a support and."
14689.0,Patient,yeah and he has been.
527.0,Provider,"In you know and letting him know like. I need you to not let the eating disorder be okay in our relationship. Like I you know, maybe you need him to be more open and honest and direct with you like to push that you know, so that you can. You know, keep staying present in the relationship. Okay, so the challenge is. to at least. Do it three or four times before our next session, if we do every day yeah that would be great but. Trying trying different little scenarios to like some things that are a little bit easier to talk about and some things that may be a little bit more challenging to talk about to. Like so you can practice and because I want you to see some successes in it and kind of journal about what those experiences were like for you. Like you know, maybe what you said what how he responded how you felt afterwards, like what your coping strategies were. And you know and what feelings, I was able to identify for myself."
14689.0,Patient,As.
527.0,Provider,"Well, you got your cheat sheets so user teach sheets. that's what those are for. Okay. yeah you can use cheat sheets I don't care. Okay. All right, Lady I was looking at your schedule, because I think we need to put some I think we've only got one more appointment scheduled. Next week gosh we're at the end of October, already yes, because we moved your session because i've got a doctor's appointment so next week, we have it at 10 at one o'clock. yeah Okay, and then.

What does your Monday I know you've got group Monday, but. or Tuesday I guess what's what."
14689.0,Patient,would be better.
527.0,Provider,"Tuesday the second. Okay does morning morning work better, for you, that day or."
14689.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Like do you want to do the same time, like nine o'clock. Okay. Did you say Monday or Tuesday. Tuesday Okay. I thought I clicked on Tuesday. Okay. All right, then, do you want to go back to Wednesday mornings, then Anna. at nine for November."
14689.0,Patient,yeah.
