So it'll be three times a week for group and then twice a month for individual therapy, and that is. That I don't know how long that's been active like that, for, and then they have you set for monthly drug screening now. That is what is being recommended, and that is due to the excessive know shows it does notate here that, if there are more no shows that occur, then you're already must be seen three times a week. or we're going to end up having to recommend discharge for higher level of care which I don't want to do, because I love."
