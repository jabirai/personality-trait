14549.0,Patient,"I felt great like I was really happy. I was very productive. But like today i'm kind of tired my breathing a little heavier I can kind of fill it a little more right here. But other than that, like just the breathing itself up kind of I think what making my situation, a lot worse."
298.0,Provider,"Are you taking the zoloft. yeah Okay, what is the dose at."
14549.0,Patient,"It my doctor just asked it to 100. Before I was right before I got with you guys, so I was only taking like 50. Okay, so he's like we need to have. And then he gave me goose perowne I haven't taken that, though I I kind of want to wanted to because i've been known to have like a lot of side effects of medication. So I wanted to like kind of get past this breathing thing a little more before I started taking it, I mean in my own mind that I was thinking, but I haven't started taking that I haven't taken a lorazepam and it's been over a week. I have yeah and when I do take them, I honestly i'm super weird about any medication I literally I either take half or half of a half I don't want like something controlling I hate that feeling so."
298.0,Provider,"Well, but here's the deal with so loft you've got to build up your levels in order for it to be. Effective in your brain. And with boost part it's the same situation it's not an as needed medicine, and so you would need to be. You would need to take it regularly in order to get the effect you wouldn't even really know what you're doing until two weeks into it. Complete. yeah."
14549.0,Patient,"You got told me that he was like you know it's not. it's not something that's going to be instant but he said once he he was very trying trying to convince me to take it and i'm like look. I have more of like but where I can't focus and the were like my mind races, that I do really depression or anxiety, I think, once I get to that point where i'm like i'm not doing the stuff I need to do. i'm freaking out because, like my life is chaos like it's just all over the place, I don't know if that makes sense, and it really it starts depressing me it starts giving me anxiety because I get behind on things like. Our first appointment, I was remembering that remembering remembering it and I was like Okay, you know, like for real like it seriously that's just how i've lived. That makes me, I mean if it makes any sense at all like it's I am just all over the place, like, I know, when I mean I look like a madwoman i'm like. I go from the bathroom to the kitchen and the living room to the office to the like I don't stay in one spot. drives me insane like what i'm doing it's like Okay, but other people are starting to notice it and they're like what the heck is wrong with you you're crazy like not crazy, you know, but can you. write like stay on task, and my. i've been with my therapist, which I find your guys's things I don't know if you've got any information but i've been with her i've been seeing her pretty consistently weekly for four years um and she keeps begging me to do something about she says that I have. 88."
