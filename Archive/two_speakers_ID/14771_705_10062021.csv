705.0,Provider,"Alright, my apologies, I know the time was a ticket i'm like I gotta be ready to transfer did you hear what the recording where it was all messed up."
14771.0,Patient,"or no I didn't but it's Okay, I totally understand, no."
705.0,Provider,"I got I got it right now i'm like deep breathing for a moment. yeah zoom to just in case if we become disconnected just go ahead and re enter and i'll let you back in it's happened a couple of times today, but even with our groups, as you know, if that happens to you just sign back in will read a minute and go from there."
14771.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"So Louis so thank you too for filling out I have your history questionnaire, so that is great, I will try to reference where i'm not asking you all the same, repeated questions. What I like to share to is this today is a little bit different it's called like a bps it's a bio psychosocial assessment i'm so used to doing the acronym. In group, as you know, we kind of talked about what may come up in individual sessions it's more of talking about feelings coping skills we explore stuff. Today is different we're it's more of a question kind of answering we get to know more of your history of and what's currently going on okay. Have you ever had anything like this before."
14771.0,Patient,"We don't think I have um I think the most that i've gotten out of. therapy, like the closest i've come was barely into transitioning into the therapist getting to know me, but that was like one session so I mean I can kind of understand and see where this is going to go, but at the same time I don't think i've ever really wanted processes going doing."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I am glad that you are here and that you're getting this going that's good for you, I enjoyed having you in group, you were really spot on and the things that you were had the courage and that was on your day one, I believe."
14771.0,Patient,"I felt like it was good to share just because of the fact that you know I think it's good to speak up and contribute and I felt even if I do feel anxiety and anxious about sharing Sometimes I feel like. what's the worst that could happen, the worst that can happen is somebody understanding or somebody relating you know, and I think sometimes it's just breaking out of my Shell that I put myself in sometimes."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and and you did that, and you had the courage to just say it, and then, as you could see everybody light bulbs went off and they're like totally relate, I know what you're talking about. You know and you're already doing cognitive behavior therapy, how you just replaced how you would fill in US what's The worst thing that can happen. that's a hot tub behavior therapy. Already."
14771.0,Patient,"i'm pretty proud of myself and thank you for the support I really appreciate it it's a lot of I like. i'm aware of a lot of things it's just having to remind myself sometimes when I want to go back to the old habits or just old coping skills that i've just been so comfortable and being in. That I realized that. In order to grow and change that I need to kind of look at everything for what it is and slowly go through the motions of practicing it and some days i'll get it another days I like I will but it's just having that patients, I feel like for myself it's just most important right now. It has a little bit more empathy and self compassion."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, oh, my goodness that self compassion if if that is at the end of the day, if you can just draw on that it's like yes i'm so. know well, great I, I am glad to hear how you're already embracing you know this process because you're right two things change and we involve we evolve, you know we're like learning new coping mechanisms and exploring more and."
14771.0,Patient,"Total good, healthy stuff yeah it is I honest, I have two books that i've been reading so far, but um it's just kind of been helping me, you know kind of do a little bit of introspection but kind of seeing it from an outside view too. And it's just been a whole process but i'm happy to be here and i'm happy to be starting the process and going and doing group sessions and also having therapy sessions and working on my mental health, and you know sharing my story."
705.0,Provider,that's awesome if you don't mind which two books are you reading.
14771.0,Patient,"um I actually have them. That was given to me it didn't start with you how inherited family trauma shapes who we are, how to end the cycle. and family ties that bind a self help guide to change their family of origin therapy that was given to me by the last therapist that I was seeing but um it's kind of been helping me somewhat. In terms of understanding, just a little bit and more of my situation and, like how it kind of ties into everything."
705.0,Provider,"Right oh my gosh that's awesome, the more you are like educating yourself, the more that you're like putting these pieces together why we're in group probably more and more in the book you're going to start to go back to me like that's what they were talking. about it today."
14771.0,Patient,"Exactly that's that's that's what I felt like a little bit in the beginning, I was like I might need to catch up. I was like I kind of understand I was like where everybody's at or what they're talking about so it was like I I feel like I can. relate, so I want to share and it's good like these books and i've been reading a tons of other articles and just. And just talking with family members and just opening up a little bit more so it's just been really been helping me like. So i'm just very hopeful, you know, and I think this is really good for me and I look forward to going to more coop sessions like I said, like. Just interacting and hearing stories just something that moves me and just because I feel like i'm very empathic like I love to hear where people come from. And how it ties in with me and how much I used to think that I was alone, and a lot of situations, but not really."
705.0,Provider,"And that is healing within itself, where you don't feel alone, and you feel like that this is part of the healing process is not only getting to know you. But to open that door to know others, even though, if there's been trauma and other types of things of distrust that you're learning to rebuild that trust with even yourself within the group yeah yeah. Well i'm excited to have you in our friday's group and so i'm hoping i'll see you this Friday again."
14771.0,Patient,"Yes, yes i'm. Exactly again for. Not showing up last week I just had an emergency, with my mom she was sick. So I really had to be there for she got coven and then got pneumonia so I really had to be the primary one in this household because we live together. To really watch over her, and I was just really worried and I didn't think that I could show up to group that day and be wholeheartedly fully there so but I am going this week, now that I have. Most of my ducks in a row, and I feel a little bit more grounded from last week's shakiness in terms of going and just a lot of the worrying and anxiousness about and on in her health."
705.0,Provider,"yeah totally understandable a family emergency is as a reason to cancel group I mean i'm sorry, but if you need to something like that absolutely um you know is your mom is she feeling better now."
14771.0,Patient,"she's feeling a lot better she still has pneumonia, but I am still you know a little worried, but it's getting a little bit better i'm just hoping that over these few days you'll get a little bit more, better. So i'm just here, supporting whatever she needs like i've just been helping a lot around the House and just what. help her feel better in any way that I can."
705.0,Provider,yeah well i'm glad that you were there for her and i'm sure that was a really traumatic and scary situation of having your mom have both the. same setting healthy vibe so i'm hoping.
14771.0,Patient,"I appreciate it, but I will be a group this Friday. I do I. do want to get back into getting that ball rolling, and I think it's healthy like I said I want to be in that setting where I can share and hear stories and I think it's very helpful not yeah just to my growth."
705.0,Provider,"Phase yeah. yeah and again, though frana is understandable though, why you needed to cancel and so no worries you took care of what you need it now you're refocusing on yourself and you're like okay mom is getting better. Now I can be this other end, and you know today to I always share with confidentiality, that if someone calls me tomorrow and they say you know oh so you had the bps last night, what was the outcome. If it's outside of bright heart health I can't confirm or deny that I even know you, it would just that's what I say is I can't confirm or deny. Until you would release information, you would sign a consent form so just to give you, you know of how this works. outside of that confidentiality is kept, with the exception of a mandated reporter for chocolate protective services or adult protective services. So, in the event that somebody has been abuse that's something that I do report, and you, and I would talk about it, the other than that if you say that you're going to hurt somebody else we're going to get them help and get you help if you. Say you're going to harm yourself we're going to get you help and the support that you need. Other than that, you know everything is confidential with it we work as a team, as you know. Anything questions before we get going."
14771.0,Patient,"None that you've actually been very helpful and just just guiding me through the process of you know what's going to happen, so I feel very comfortable to start."
705.0,Provider,anytime I get excited about asking questions in this process and so anytime you just be like I know Valerie. What did you say. yeah absolutely so what I always like to ask the first reason is like or the first question is what was your reason for signing up for Brian heart health.
14771.0,Patient,"I think I just was tired of feeling like stuck in cycles that I wanted to break like I wanted to grow and expand but. I didn't think I had the tools necessary, although, like I said I was aware, I wanted to feel more support and feel like i'm not crazy like these are things that happened and to feel validated. So basically the number one reason, just to improve my mental health and grow and give myself the chance to go like I deserve to like I want to."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly wow what you just said again i'm i'm hearing so much like that affirmation that you just like write that stuff down. you're having a down day, just like reference that real quick."
14771.0,Patient,"You do journal, so I do try to go back and I reread my journal posts and I tried to remind myself, you know. Just as much as bad days that i'm having I have good days, where I wake up and i'm like I have this like. I can do this, you know, even if it is a little shaky I am unsure like I don't know what would happen, I want to build that confidence and that self esteem, to know that, even if it isn't an unknown for me that it doesn't hurt to have faith and to have hope and myself."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah yeah, and that is definitely you know speaks to your level of self confidence that it may not look all Nice and pretty and packaged up but i'm going to deal with it the best I. know and i'm going to be okay i'm gonna be more than okay with it. Self acceptance, yes, absolutely right now what's the current city and state that you live in."
14771.0,Patient,"I live in California and the city, I live in San Diego."
705.0,Provider,"i'm originally from Texas just a small little. Originally from Texas 219 people and I moved to San Diego after I turned 22 I think. Really, now I live in orange county but I love San Diego."
14771.0,Patient,"Honestly it's my hometown and it's where I grew up and although I kind of find myself thinking, like, I want to move, you know I have family in Texas as well, it is a beautiful as well. I want to move away but i'm like 57 Diego like this is just my home like this is where I grew up, and it is beautiful, I agree."
705.0,Provider,"Well, you know you always have the choice to move about the cabin. And then you don't like it you move back or you know what I mean so yeah."
14771.0,Patient,"that's what I also tell myself, I want to explore, you know San Diego will be here, but yes, where I was born and raised San Diego."
705.0,Provider,"I mean it's just like San Diego puts a smile on my face just to say it. Again, now it is you're raised and born there, so I could see where you want to venture out explore some other knows. Okay. Well, good good good who do you live with right now and sweet San Diego."
14771.0,Patient,I live with my mother and her husband my setup okay.
705.0,Provider,"And are you married single divorce. Okay, and any children yeah. Right and, as far as legal troubles to I think no legal troubles know duis or anything like that. Okay, and hobbies What do you do for fun."
14771.0,Patient,"I do like to write when the time or when I end, you know. I listened to a lot of music, so it kind of gives me inspiration to kind of look within my emotions and kind of poured into paper it do like to go swimming I had his schedule to where I would wake up and my would go swimming because I love the water ocean wherever I love to be in. photography is something that i'm trying to get back into because it was something that, as a kid I really loved and I really enjoyed growing up doing. And I have cameras it's just finding the motivation to get out again and take pictures of things which I have slowly. i've slowly been trying to push myself to kind of just take a day out in the Nice sun and just take a drive somewhere to take photos. i'm not reading what you wanted them to I find pleasure in reading and kind of unwinding just because my mind's always active so it's just nice to have a change of pace to relax. or other than that, I would say yeah Those are just the main things that I really enjoy I really like to do that, as my hobbies."
705.0,Provider,Those are good ones and I like that you have several level where you're like okay if i'm not motivated for this i'm going to try these others it's good yeah I saw two on the sheet that you filled out previously to that there's some some college um did you take psychology by chance.
14771.0,Patient,"I did I did take psychology for quite a while, but I stopped just because of the fact that I had changed my interest oh cooking is also one of them I love to cook. But i'm currently in the process is just saving enough money to be able to enter culinary arts school, but on the side I just look up recipes when I can, and I just go ahead and just go to cook for the dish and I. Like it, it turns out, pretty well for my taste so yeah there's there's some that's one thing i'm also passionate about cooking as well."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, good good good that's nice to with psychology that you already have the basics, where the different theories and now. let's see your race to i'm seeing by your bunch of biological mother and father. Yes, would you say today your relationship is close strained relationship. In the middle."
14771.0,Patient,"individually with my mom I would say it was changed in the past, before, but we are working, I feel like we're working towards you know, having like a more solid relationship, a mother daughter relationship to where I can be more open with her, I can feel more safe. I would say the relationship. With my dad is strained I don't speak with my father, just because I did come from an abusive past with him and I just don't feel because I just don't want to put myself in a position to be hurt again emotionally or physically."
705.0,Provider,And I.
14771.0,Patient,"feel like his behavior hasn't changed, although he's tried to reach out to me on several occasions. And through my uncles and switch i've repeatedly and respectfully have told them that i'm not ready, you know or don't know when i'll be ready. On, I just wanted to give myself a chance to just heal first, before I really think about being strong enough for my dad and for myself just to have a functioning relationship."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely. Fine, and i'm glad that you're like you know what No, this is about me, I want to do my healing first, you know as a kid you don't have a choice things happen and you're there, and you do the best that you can to survive it. you're an adult now you have the right to say no, you can verbalize it."
14771.0,Patient,"Thank you. Just that validation is just so nice just because of the fact that i've been told the opposite finding his side of the family and I love them and I miss them, and I would love to have a close relationship with his side, but unfortunately they took his side over my word. So i'm kind of in the position to where I feel like the black sheep just because I don't want to accept a certain behavior that doesn't help me."
705.0,Provider,"Especially to when it comes to us as the family has their own reasons to to want to keep it quiet and not to believe in the have denial. But again, it comes back to you and your journey and where you are and that, today, you can be like you know what no I don't want to do this today, and you know what more than okay with it."
14771.0,Patient,"Thank you that's that's how i've been feeling and trying to remind myself when I get into that self doubt period of just thinking like am I, making the right decision like should I have a bigger person, but. I think i've given a lot of chances to where I was a bigger person, even as a child, so I think I deserve to give myself a chance to just be in peace and just kind of give myself a chance to just. rest and not feel on edge all the time or feel like I have to constantly walk on eggshells yeah."
705.0,Provider,"All that is you were talking to about that promoting self growth, these things are going to promote yourself growth and having the view situ endured as a child, you know, again we take those imprints when we're a child into our adulthood, you can. There comes a point where you decide that you know what I can I can change this up. To. And so, all of what you're doing and being able to speak up and set your boundaries, you get to pick and choose and what the family till you know. i'll come around one has time I say i'm sorry, this is about you i'm so glad that you're just here and you're like i'm moving forward."
14771.0,Patient,"Thank you, I yeah I i've had to battle with that quite a lot for the past few years, but I think it got to a point where like like you said, like I just put my foot down like I was just like. No like how many times have I pushed myself aside and the feelings that i've had. Just make someone else comfortable or feel like they can have access to me and my emotions my time my love my care when it's not being reciprocated and i'm not being cared for in a way that's fulfilling to me and my needs. One are they going to be important, so yeah it's just it's been a long journey but i've come a long way. And I can say I am proud of myself just because. I finally had the power to say no, and not feel guilty about it just feel good about setting a boundary of where I don't want to cross it and I don't want people to cross that with me."
705.0,Provider,"good for you absolutely on all of it, and I hope with your Journal and i'm sure you already are of jotting these like daily things of like Yes, this is my boundaries here I didn't get as a child that appreciation of my boundaries, so today. I said it and guess what when you cross it i'm going to pull it back and say i'm not today. Again, and it is, is it's it can be challenging with family members and especially if they're projecting things on to you that has nothing to do with with you. And i'm not trying to discount how you feel and how you know doubting yourself about should I should I not but understanding that that's the projection of them where they are, and if they're going to live in denial, then Okay, but you refuse to and you're going to take your time."
14771.0,Patient,"that's exactly how i've been feeling you basically summed it up in the best statement i've ever Thank you yes um yeah um. it's just about the guilt tripping then i've had a lot of trouble on just because when i've tried to distance myself and I made it very clear it's just. them not are adamantly and being fully aware of not respecting that and I just think, in a sense, like there's times, where I would feel like Am I ever gonna. get out of this like Am I ever gonna have them realize like and I don't think I can make somebody, but I can express myself to the point where I can make myself very clear in a respectful way and I just feel like as of lately. And they haven't and i've been received some. i'm not aggressive messages, but I would say messages to where accountability wasn't being taken as seriously as i'd like it to be. And just reading it sometimes kind of puts me in like a downer just because I wish I didn't see the message like I wish I didn't give it myself time to read it, but sometimes like when they find me on my social media, which is something that. I understand that with social media, you can only do so much private as you'd like to be, but they always end up finding my account somehow or like. One of them like it's just very hard to build trust with them and through my cousins that have their fathers and mothers that are related to my father. it's just so hard to build trust with them, just because of the fact that if I say one thing to one cousin somehow it ends up being related to the whole family and somehow my dad ends up finding out like. what's been going on in my life and things that i'm not okay with like things that I. can't fully control, but I fully remind them that I don't want any part of them being in my life right now and i'm not ready, but yet somehow they find out. The 411 of how i've been or what I look like, as of right now, or just like my well being and it just feels so invasive sometimes."
705.0,Provider,"And that being mindful with social media to have how how much time do you want to invest in it like curiosity wise and just being able to check on On your other family and friends, but also to like anything else is a balance of if it gets to be too much you can adjust."
14771.0,Patient,"yeah that's something that i'm trying to remind myself when I just I can pull it back that when I want to, I have a choice it's the free will part that gets me so."
705.0,Provider,Times just because.
14771.0,Patient,"Of the fact that i'm like wow I do have free will, like, I have the choice to decide to change things that i'm able to control and it's just coming back to that idea of like Oh, I actually do have the power, like, I have to say, it is my life."
705.0,Provider,yeah but.
14771.0,Patient,"hello, he is my father that doesn't necessarily you know i'm should be controlled, you know I am my own person I just are to be able to express what I feel, and what I think you know and not feel so stifled or feel boxed in because. me is not able to accept it or is just not in a place to you know meet me where i'm at."
705.0,Provider,"And that's the highlight right there as to meet you are, you are because, with trauma it takes time to process and to heal from it. And so having where you already know this about yourself and who you allow to invite in that you know it's like hey I get it, people are wanting to be around me but guess what i'm going through it and i'm going to do it my pace there's not a timeline. and remind me, and you know, not a timeline here. I am again so happy to hear where that's healthy it's just like yeah i'm going to take my time i'm going to do what I need to do. I guess what you don't really have to explain anything if you don't want to."
14771.0,Patient,Stay true nature.
705.0,Provider,yeah work in progress. work in progress i'll get back to you.
14771.0,Patient,"won't agree, yes, yes, exactly where I am and you know, and I am very hopeful it's just never it never, although I have my moments I do have doubts it's still just that feeling of hope of giving myself a chance. That the daily I was waiting for others to give to me, but then I realized no one's going to give me that I have to give that to myself, like, I have to learn how to give that to myself and just taking back that power. doing that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and recreating to your sense of self and your trust within yourself and then putting that out to people that you want, in your circle. yeah you know to friend in a way we're talking about this too, I know, one of the things here that's the question if you see me looking down it's just the guidelines here, you know if within your family on either side that's there's either mental health disorders or substance use disorders."
14771.0,Patient,"On my dad said, I would say there isn't something that was talked about so much or really it was kind of just shoved under the rug but. Through the grapevine i've heard that my aunt a struggles with bipolar i'm not sure what type. But that also my dad had struggled with schizophrenia, although i'm not too sure if he was diagnosed or not, or that was just a self diagnosis by his own family um yes, there has been a lot of substance abuse within. That side as well with my uncles and aunts mainly with my uncles and drinking and drugs, a few of them have been in and out of jail. So there's history within that side and which is somewhat of what I can understand, as I got older like. Of the mental illness that was never really talked about or brought up or issues that they knew that they were struggling with but chose to kind of just. overlook because again mental health wasn't something that was important on their side it wasn't something that they were taught and it wasn't something along the lines that when they grew up and they got older as an adult that they found to be valuable. In understanding until later, I believe, with one of my aunts but even then that and i'm not very close to just because again. i'm they're kind of all they kind of all kind of watch each other's backs and kind of justifying. Certain behaviors again that i'm just not okay with so."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you for sharing that, and you know part of the the question and getting to understand more because where you were talking about the boundary crossing and things like that that it. makes a little bit more sense to have they're coming from a place, especially if it's an entry to that they're not. Regulating they're not knowing how to put a boundary there are what it's like to. Respect the boundary."
14771.0,Patient,"Right right and that is something that I came to understand is that. They couldn't know or even if they did know as they got older when they realize that. You know a lot of the things that they weren't taught or a lot of the things that were overlooked is now catching back up to them, but they don't know how to deal with as an adult so it just kind of floods out and. Like it's a generational thing like generation after generation and I looked at it as like. loving my family but also realizing I don't want to be a part of that you know I don't want to live my life, you know not taking care of myself the way that I should and then hurting others because of that. Because that was something that I saw a lot on that side of the family, in particular, is that they would hurt each other, but then they would. Wake each other's wounds in a census, and like it's Okay, you know you're my brother you're my sister and I love you so it's fine, but it wasn't fine you know there's a lot of things that went on that weren't okay."
705.0,Provider,"And you're breaking the cycle, by going okay i'm not falling in that cycle i'm going to break the cycle, and you know working it out, doing the counseling and. You can have as much understanding, you know, like okay so undiagnosed mental health disorders substance use Okay, I understand, still doesn't give them the right to do what they you know, especially with your father of what he did. And if he chooses not to get the help for himself, where do you then set those boundaries, as you navigate through life. And as you start to heal. And that only for you to establish or not establish those boundaries."
14771.0,Patient,"Right, and I think that's um i'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt I think that's where why I said earlier, I felt like the black sheep just because they see it as like if you distance yourself then you're judging them or you're you're. You know, aside from being judgmental you're you think you're better than everybody else that's what they'll guilt trip you into thinking and they have said it to me and. But i've had to be strong enough to kind of just. take a deep breath and realize that that's not the truth, like, although that is somebody's perception that is not the truth of the matter. I don't want to be swayed or guilt trip into thinking that i'm a certain somebody to someone when I know who I am and I know why i'm doing the things that i'm doing for myself."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. All also important and again it's just like you have done already so much like soul searching and getting in there and just being like Okay, you know I don't deserve this, I am going to start to heal from this. And guess what you know what's beyond your circle of control, you still have the power within do you want to invite that in your life or not and it's like it goes back to. In the event like you said you take a deep breath to interject that thought that you're not going to take responsibility for that."
14771.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"It is, and I know you know it's it's tough it's tough when you come from family members, and I think one of our groups, we were even talking about with the holidays are coming up and how I handle that."
14771.0,Patient,"that's also one thing that you know growing up it's like wanting to be around family or something that I really wanted as a kid and. You know I didn't really understand why I didn't get to see his side of the family so much until I got older and I realized, when I was around them more as an adult that you know. All the things that I would wish for you know, being able to spend Christmas with them or thanksgiving you know. It may not always be that way and that's Okay, and you know in those moments that I would rather be in peace in solitude than to be in company, where I feel uncomfortable. and understanding that I can love somebody but I don't have to accept certain things and I think. Having to wrap my mind around like I won't have a Christmas like I used to have or like a thanksgiving or easter's at my grandpa's ranch like I used to have every year with my family. You know that we're special and that's still our special it's just different now because i'm in a different period of my life, where. Although I would like those things it's not something that I want to force and I don't want to force myself. Just based off memories, I want to be comfortable and again understand that maybe this year might not be the most ideal like I said in terms of holidays or birthdays or, for that matter, but. If it's something that I need to do for my own growth and to understand, myself and live my life, a little bit better and where I want to take it then. I guess that's just what you know, sometimes i'm to do put my big girl pants on."
705.0,Provider,"This would be to I know and one of the groups we've already talked about it, but if you feel comfortable bring it into group, too, because these are things that sometimes people are already having to deal with. But they haven't maybe put like how you're describing it or they haven't had you know the courage to say something, because because they've been told, for many years that's not the way you think about your family we're family, this is this is how you have to be but it's like, no, no, no."
14771.0,Patient,"No, the idea is is flood a lot and I understand because of loyalty because of a sense of belonging to. A basically a tribe your family people that are supposed to protect you and love you, but at the same time understanding that sometimes those people that you would think that would have your best interests in mind. are not always the best people to really do that for you and that happens, a lot within a family dynamic what within my family dynamics that's something that i've come to understand that. As much as I would want them to be the adults and to think that, because they are the adult. When I was younger that they should know better, because that's what I was taught, you know i'm the adults, I know more than you you're just a child, but I was subjected to so many things, and I think to myself, like no. Just speak to them a child doesn't mean i'm not aware it's like I don't think that's right and it doesn't make me feel good, and I remember you know speaking up to my family about that and being shunned a lot because of that excuse of going back to. You don't know you're just a child, like that's not what family does you know that's not how family treats each other we're supposed to be here for one another we're blood and i'm like I understand. But at the same time i'm not going to sacrifice my own emotions and who, I am and who, I want to be, because you can accept that you want to change me or you want me to bend over backwards for things that as much as i'd love to do it's not okay with me. And i've had to come to understand that it starts with the knee first and to give my consent i'm allowed to say no."
705.0,Provider,"Right yeah and you're allowing that when they try to convince you that you're not that little girl anymore, and that you can use your voice to say not ready. he's not going to happen and so i'm glad that you're already thinking about the holiday season and what you feel is going to be the best for you and. You know it's just like sometimes it's like if it gets too overwhelming to even think about the holidays already just focus back on today and it's just like look for today i'm doing the best I can i'm learning and things about myself and keep moving forward."
14771.0,Patient,"that's what i've been trying to do is just in the present just focus on what i'm doing now, and you know when I find myself in those like. Times, where I have emotional turmoil over things like that in the past, I think back, and I think. So far, like i've done a good job, and you know what there's a lot of things that. I wish I could have handled better, but it was what I knew in the moment and i'm learning and i'm growing and it's not going to stop like i'm 25 i'm still learning i'm still doing a lot for myself and it's okay and i'm okay if it just remind yourself that I am okay. This is where I want to be in this is how i've gotten myself here."
705.0,Provider,"And I like to that you know, because the next piece of this is talking more about like our safety protocol and it's more of the Columbia risk I don't know if you're familiar with it with a suicide. ideation I mean sometimes you you go there, because you don't know anything else, like you were saying, but now you know. So some of these questions, I know are sensitive and mentor but we're trying to see to where, in the event, if things do surface or just kind of what what it is. That you've had in the past, this is it within your lifetime, like in your lifetime, have you ever wished that you are dead or wish that you would go to sleep and not wake up."
14771.0,Patient,"Oh yes, yeah I would say so just because again dealing with abuse, and I would say it's. mainly been around it started with my father and then kind of grew into my relationships, as I got older with men and it became something to where I would. Face my self esteem and my worth of being loved videos and some one that wasn't being presented, or I wouldn't. necessarily get what I the affection or love that I would crave from somebody that I valued, it would instantly plummet me down into i'm nothing like I just don't want to do this."
705.0,Provider,"With with that and that's feelings, have you ever then started to plan how you might hurt yourself."
14771.0,Patient,"And there was a time I when I was nine yeah I was nine years and I was already planning on like how I wanted to, and there was another time when I was 16 I was already planning on like how I wanted to do it when I wanted to do it and. It was pretty intense just because of the fact that it was a moment where nobody in my family and not my mother, my brother knew. what was going on with me but yeah I would say in those moments I had twice in my life, how I wanted to do it, but other than that it's just mainly been like I don't want to wake up or I don't want to do this, like I don't want to be here okay."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you for clarifying because definitely then it sounds like when you were younger and you didn't have many outlets, you were just like Okay, this seems like my only answer. However, when would be like 30 days years since the last time that you did think about more than just like going to sleep and not waking up like more of I want to hurt myself in this is what what i'm thinking."
14771.0,Patient,"It was about two months ago I was admitted into the emergency room, because I was having suicide idealization and that was when I was with a partner at the time I was seeing somebody and. There was just a lot of issues going on in the relationship that kind of triggered me into remembering the things that I didn't want to remember so i'm I will admit it over the night and they watched me and I was released, but later on that week, I was already when I was. Because I had stayed with him for a little bit, but in that week that I had stayed on after the hospitalization. I had another time, where I was, I wanted to drown myself and the ocean views the situation that I was in with him was just too intense and I didn't know how to handle that at that moment, because I was, I felt alone. But and I didn't do it. And he stopped me but. Since then that's been the last time."
705.0,Provider,"So, about two two months ago and that you started to plan, did you said, like a specific date that you would carry it out. Two months ago."
14771.0,Patient,"I think it was just in that moment, I was just sure that. That, I just wanted to do it, like the closest thing that I could find. kind of being like a quick easy way to just go was because he live near the ocean, and I was just like it was like five minute walk so it's just like i'm just gonna walk there i'm just going to do it."
705.0,Provider,"So, two months ago that was how you were feeling and then you were hospitalized today any feelings of wanting to do self harm."
14771.0,Patient,"No as a known as of them now, just because i've looked back on it and. Luckily i've been reading a lot of posts lately, and you know as much as it seems easier to feel unwanted on this earth that sometimes to just give myself a chance to live."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and definitely Fernando we want you to be able to if any of these thoughts resurface to not sit on it, we want you to be able to reach out and get the help that you deserve. And that's why we're going to do a safety plan to and then you'll have this email, have you done a safety plan before."
14771.0,Patient,I don't think I haven't.
705.0,Provider,"Okay it's good just to have on hand i'll ask you some questions we'll talk about that and then i'll email it to you um any weapons in your House. No guns or okay. Have you ever collected pills or giveaway valuables or wrote a suicide note or anything like that, before."
14771.0,Patient,No i've never written anything given away valuables or anything like that.
705.0,Provider,"Would you say now that you have hope, or you feel hopeless."
14771.0,Patient,"We have hope and as much as i'd like to think it's dwindling I know that if I realistically look at it, that I have more hope than anything. Coming back to the idea of just giving myself a chance. i'm just wanting to live."
705.0,Provider,Can you tell me to a couple of reasons why you feel like life is worth living.
14771.0,Patient,"Just to see where I can go with my career and to explore different parts of the world where i've wanted to travel and you know meet new people. Great friends build better relationships with people around me like my family my mom my brother my step dad and. Just knowing that as bitter sweet as moments can be life is really beautiful and that i've had a lot of Nice encounters with individuals and strangers that have done a lot of kind of things that I didn't even think was possible because I was so focused on feeling like. You know there's not much left for me, but it's just in those moments right here is that. You know. it's beautiful. And i've gone through. i've just gone through a lot, but it shouldn't. take away from the fact that you know. As much as i'd like to think there's not reasons to live there is, and I just have to take a second to just breathe and look around me and see that. there's so much out there."
705.0,Provider,"It is it is front end, and you know, being able, you know some level two I hear you even saying that you feel like a sense of responsibility to still be here for your family and your friends and. That you have all this stuff that's like traveling and who you're going to get to meet and all those learning opportunities. And the career, you know I think part of it, too, is engaging more and work or in school, you know anything like that i'm part of this to have what we look. Like what we look for is like any of the pro. factors like protective factors, do you have any sense of belief i'm sorry i'm reading from this one that was kind of distorted, do you have any sense of belief that suicide is immoral."
14771.0,Patient,"and I feel like at that moment, I would think that you know it's not really up to me, in terms of feeling like if it's a moral or immoral, I really feel like. Everybody comes from different walks of life and everybody creating says different things that sometimes leads them to feel a certain way. And I don't necessarily want to feel like judging someone based off the fact that they want to take away their life but understanding as to maybe why and on my own level relating to that going through that. So I would like to think that i'm just neutral and feeling like. it's not my place to say you know it's not my. it's not like it's not a right, but coming from I come from, you know i'm just really understanding, like, I can understand why, but I wouldn't necessarily want to shame somebody from feeling like they don't want to be here, but just wanting to understand why."
705.0,Provider,"So, like any periods from childhood or into now, where you hear voices anything that tells you like to do things or."
14771.0,Patient,know.
705.0,Provider,"When you do have the thoughts like you were describing two months ago, do you think at that time does those thoughts in are like many times a day once a week once or twice a month daily."
14771.0,Patient,"I would say once or twice a month, I think, in that month, it was just a lot going and I felt like I wasn't really. Getting the support that I needed and that I kind of felt like I was stuck in a cycle of you know, being mistreated and being. You know not really appreciated and valued and not valuing myself or appreciating myself and knowing when to walk away from the situation that is just not serving the best good for me or my mental health."
705.0,Provider,"duration to was it fleeting, which is a few seconds or minutes, was it less than an hour, more than one or four hours 48 hours or more persistent like eight hours."
14771.0,Patient,"I would say it was more than an hour I think at that moment it lasted around like an hour and a half to two hours. I was like probably the most intense one that i've had that the one that was two months ago, just because it was very overwhelming and I felt very. Trapped like I felt like I needed to go like I just needed to get out but I didn't know how to do that in a healthy way or to speak on what I needed."
705.0,Provider,"So before before to it sounds like front end and that you are able to control it with with not as much difficulty, but two months ago it was more difficulty for you to control. yeah Okay, and were there any deterrence that stopped you, such as religion pain of death family that stopped you from acting on wanting to die."
14771.0,Patient,"I would say it was a person than it was without the time just because he was living with his family and I didn't want to cause a scene, or to traumatize anybody. But it just it was just a feeling that was just overwhelming like it was just like I wanted to do it like no one's gonna stop me, but he wouldn't let me leave, so I thank you for that."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely and i'm glad that he was there for you, you know part of when like. A lot of this will be on your safety plan and would then the person you're talking about Would he be one of the top three people that you could ask for help."
14771.0,Patient,"um no not anymore, just because it was a time where trust was being broken between us and I felt. As much as he. And much, and I thank him for being there. out somebody now that I would consider you know reaching out to or really being able to help me in a way that I would need just because he's going through his own journey and. yeah I wouldn't say."
705.0,Provider,"All right, well, thank you for clarifying so that time he was there, which is great, but for right now, can you name three people that you. That you do have in your life, who you could ask for ill."
14771.0,Patient,"Yes, I do um I have my mother she's been really good about understanding more about my emotions as of lately and being more supportive and that aspect and really checking in with me on the how i've been feeling um my brother, and I would say, his girlfriend."
705.0,Provider,And if you don't mind your mom's name.
14771.0,Patient,My mom's name is Laura.
705.0,Provider,Laura la you are a yes okay and you're just seeing me writing if you're wondering what i'm doing here your brother's name.
14771.0,Patient,His name is Damien D Ay Ay Ay.
705.0,Provider,Ay Ay. Am okay. Damien and then damon's damien's girlfriend.
14771.0,Patient,that's solid is going to be K E T is a la.
705.0,Provider,"Okay perfect and you have all three of their numbers, like in your contacts, for your phone. Yes, okay perfect when you're having a crisis, we talked about warning signs, it can be thoughts images mood situation behavior that a crisis may be developing can you give me three warning signs that you know that a crisis may be occurring."
14771.0,Patient,"I would say, when I get panic attack. I would say, when I have. I wouldn't call them anxious thoughts, but it's somewhere that's kind of in between anxiety and just thoughts of suicidal idealization of just kind of. triggering back to my past and things that i've been doing with people, and when I become like a hermit I would say is one I just. Be off the grid like I don't talk to anybody kind of just keep to myself, like I don't say anything i'm not as vocal and not as social. And i'm very withdrawn i'd say."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's run. I know the wording that you use to when I have anxious thought and then how you described it, I mean to me that that sounds like you know yourself and would know if that's on the warning signs okay. Well, what do you think there are three coping strategies, and these are internal relaxation physical activities things to take your mind off the problem, but not with contacting another person."
14771.0,Patient,"I would say i'm walking has been a great one for me there's been times, where I would take my journal with me to balboa park and which is like my favorite person to go to, and I would sit by the potential garden and just. Take a walk and like just listen to music and just sit down and write um I would also go swimming in the morning, like have a routine and like do physical exertion and. Or, I would just you know, listen to music and i'd like to sing along to music not particularly sad music, just like any type of music of any song let's just like what i'm feeling in the moment and just kind of. Remembering a time where you know I will be, you know that was a really good time. It can range like either when I was like a child or a teenager just even now, just like little things to be grateful for and ground myself. And i'm trying to learn breathing techniques that's something that i'm still trying to you know get a hold on and learn that just taking a second and just breathing would do so much help and sometimes I forget."
705.0,Provider,"It happens, but you know what again that's why we, we come up with the plan says it gives you at least now something that you have and you're. Like okay. Now i'm going to look at here's my distractions here's where I can go, I mean we already know with going to the park or walking or drilling or singing or listening to music. And in that crisis that's going to make a difference where it's just like Okay, I know I don't need to you know, think about oh I should do this, this is this is like it's part of the plan. yeah yeah and if you can put it on your eat you know i'll email it to you sometimes people will leave it in their email or they will print a coffee whatever works for you just where you can reference it. And then, what I always asked to there's a couple of numbers to that I give. The 988 is the suicide hotline you don't need to call the one 800 number anymore, you can call just 988 or go to the nearest you know hospital if you needed or er another good one, if you haven't already utilize the 741741, which is the text crisis lines. Have utilized them before."
14771.0,Patient,"and utilize the before I didn't know that I could only dial nine eight, but I have called the one 800 number, I remember calling that that night that I wasn't feeling okay. I did speak with somebody over the phone and they stayed on the phone with me, and so I was just able to really just kind of get a grounding. To have this feeling. But I didn't know that there was a texting one I didn't know that one haven't tried that one, but I was aware of the other one."
705.0,Provider,"And you used it and so that is even better, because now, you know that self confidence in yourself that if I do get in crisis, I know how to manage my crisis. So the 988 great that one specifically for Suicide Prevention, the 741741 where you text back and forth is a crisis counselor. So if you're like two o'clock in the morning you're like I can't get this thought on my head i'm feeling sad you text them they text you back and it's just a nice to have a different outlet. Also."
14771.0,Patient,Just one second.
705.0,Provider,"No, I think it's an important part in 1741741 and it will also be in your plan."
14771.0,Patient,"Thank you, I appreciate it."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and then bright heart health, you can always call Brian heart health and you can just share. i'm in crisis, or you can just usually they're so great on the line they're going to ask you how are you today or what's going on today. and to be able, just to be honest and be like look I either I am feeling suicidal or I feel like i'm getting to that point, whatever it may be, or I just need someone to talk to. You absolutely, what do you think are two things that you can do to make your environment safe. Like your environment that you live in."
14771.0,Patient,When I asked for an example.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely this usually throws people off, and I know the wording is funny no worries um it's more like not having like if you used to did you ever do any self harm with razors or anything like that. or cigarettes or burning yourself. If someone did behavior like that, before would be not to have razor blades in the House, or if they tried to commit suicide before by you know, maybe getting a gun you wouldn't have weapons in the House. Having to i've had response to this, which makes perfect sense to keep a safe environment is to keep their environment, their immediate immediate environment clean. And organized where there's a sense of control, so I mean we can any anything that you can key in on i've had someone say that I painted my colors a bright color."
14771.0,Patient,"I honestly I keep my please save by one of them would be actually really being tidy that was one of them that I was like yes, that is me, I am the type of person that likes to feel like, if I have my sacred space clean, then I can feel a little bit more at ease. Yes, and one thing I would also say, is my artwork like I collect like. Little like figurines and stuffed animals and stuff and like just my interest to like remind me that, like i'm safe and that there's little things that I can focus on and things that I can keep my mind on as my interests or just to look at and laugh at."
705.0,Provider,"Good good. And let's see on here too, so basically we got Allah already asked you just looking to make sure that I got all. As far as to, and I know some of the social settings you've already shared like at the park. Is there any other place that's a social setting, but you can also go to that we've provided destruction."
14771.0,Patient,"I do, I have a few bow bow have happens to be the closest, but I have another place, that I like to go to it's also by the water it's a place called seaport village and it's just like. A little place with little shops, but as well, like they have a huge walkway that's like by the ships in the water, so like what I would do is just like. put on like my favorite song and, like, I would just look out the water, as I was walking and like it was like a good way to kind of distract myself but kind of give myself a sense of ease and. Ease my. Business and to just breathe fresh air."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that's a nice area to your highlights I know where that one is to seaport village. Good so you have some really good coping strategies and so you know again it's just sometimes needing that reminder that side like okay I built this up, this is what I have, so I will email you that, and then you can always add to it. change it up, if you need to. Is there any question I haven't asked you that you feel like braveheart health needs to know in order to work with you, better."
14771.0,Patient,"um. I would just say just highlighting on my history with men I. i've had I was sexually assaulted at 15. it's gonna step into a Funk, because, again in that situation where I felt like I was should have been protected I wasn't. And that kind of put me like in a downward spiral, I just have I would say just to make it more aware like I have. Not an irrational fear, but I do get a sense of anxiousness whenever i'm around like men in like physical like just anywhere like if i'm at a shop or grocery store or like out of like if I go to social setting like restaurant or just even out. I just have my reservations, sometimes, because I think back to a lot of the relationships that were abusive emotionally and. That really hurt me, so I would just want to make it a little bit more evident as to like how it started with my history with my father and then it kind of escalated to relationships and from the sexual assault that I had when I was 15 how it's kind of all like. i'm as one."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you, thank you for sharing that and also in group if anything is said that's triggering. You can say that in group because i've been in group before where somebody said something like maybe even in a joking manner, but it was in a. program where someone's like that triggered me and we were able to talk it out, where it was a learning experience for everyone i'm not saying that will happen, but just to know that if you are triggered because it's maybe not even something. That was intended that way but that's how you're taking it to be able to share that and to work through it."
14771.0,Patient,Okay being.
705.0,Provider,"Asked absolutely I wanted to see to why you and I are talking here because. We can go ahead and set up, if you like, the first individual session was. Great tuesday's work best."
14771.0,Patient,"Tuesdays are. Perfect with me, yes."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I was there, another day."
14771.0,Patient,"Oh i'm i'm pretty much flexible, I would say i'm at a point now where I can make time for the things that I feel like are necessary, and I think that. therapy is definitely one of my priorities, so I i'm very flexible, and I think if you're free tuesday's I can make time to save on twilio okay."
705.0,Provider,"cool. Let me then. See cuz. sewer right here. and i'm just looking to what they do with the care intensities is it looks like twice a month for individual therapy and then weekly with your group counseling. And then, if ever, you know you feel you need more support just let us know, and then we can we can do that, and then sometimes you know, sometimes people are with us like. A year and they're like you know I got this down, but I do just need less maybe attendance in group, but I want to know that I have the Foundation still there and then we can lower it so just communicate with us, let us know. And I am looking at, then so not next week, if we're going every. Two weeks, I was going to say the 19th. As to what I have on the 19th so the 19th this a Tuesday. It looks like on that day. there's a five o'clock, but let me look real quick into a Wednesday, you were saying you may have more on Wednesday i'm seeing Wednesday the 20th there slake. A one o'clock three o'clock four o'clock or five o'clock if any of those work for you, I."
14771.0,Patient,didn't Wednesday at one that's okay.
705.0,Provider,"You got it so, Wednesday, at one and that's October the 20th. At one o'clock and while we're talking i'm going to go ahead and schedule that where I can save it no one else takes that day."
14771.0,Patient,"Thank you, thank you again really appreciate it."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely so let's get into the color takes it one minute. warm up. Okay, so we said then that was going to be on the 20th which falls on a Wednesday and that's the 1pm which is Pacific standard time. And i'm going to put that for 16 minutes I usually put it for 60 minutes in the event, you need to sometimes people will check in and then be like you know what Valerie that's all I got for today and. If you, you know 60 minutes is at least gives you time. What i'm saying, where, if you feel like, though, that you only need 45 minutes and you've ran out man hey whatever you let me know. That encounter was safe, so we have that book any questions for me."
14771.0,Patient,"So I think I think we pretty much covered everything I think i'm ready for this Friday and i'm looking forward to group and i'm looking forward to our next session, so I think."
705.0,Provider,"Well, good good good, well, thank you again for being here and answering you know, honestly, all these questions and allowing us to get to know you a little bit better and i'm looking forward to hopefully having you back. Friday and sending good you know recovery vibes and energy to to your mom that's that's."
14771.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,that's it that's a double whammy. yeah no.
14771.0,Patient,"It was it was definitely something that left me over my side, and I was to get cool How did this happen, but I guess it's just things again just dealing with it as gracefully as I can, and just being there for my mom."
705.0,Provider,"hi and now you know that you've dealt through such a tough difficult time, but you did it and you can always draw back on that that no matter what I will manage it. And that is that it's like doesn't even have to be anything outside of that on your terms."
14771.0,Patient,"Thank you, I really appreciate that I appreciate your warm wishes and your. lives for. My mom I really do Thank you again."
705.0,Provider,you're more than welcome and I will see you then on Friday.
14771.0,Patient,"Okay, good evening."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you again, thank you, I sure will take care of an agenda. Alright, so with the assessment, it would still be moderate on the assessment, because two months ago she was wanting to act on it, she had a plan. But she was stopped she saying currently she's not suicidal she has no plan no intent a safety plan was made, we will get that to the patient. Before right now, because it was within three months it's still at that moderate risk for suicide so maybe it will change, but for right now is moderate for suicide risk.
