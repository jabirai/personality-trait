759.0,Provider,"Mind Christmas actually really good just spent it with two of my family members, we have fun, you know stuff it yeah. How like."
16129.0,Patient,"i'm. Surprisingly, it turned out better than we expected. We made usually I make you know pretty much thanksgiving dinner on Christmas also. So we have it twice. and actually my fiance decided to help me out and help make dinner. And my my mom she came over with her husband, because she had some gifts for my son and for Richard and she gave me a couple little things to. It was, I mean. Obviously, it was slightly uncomfortable for me, but because everybody was there, you know I wasn't too bothered by it, so it ended up turning out, you know all right, and my son was with me and he was happy and you know."
759.0,Provider,"that's what. Most important thing, can you know that he was happy yeah."
16129.0,Patient,"Oh yeah oh yeah he was just like i'm so happy i'm at home and I don't have to go with my dad and. He got kind of scared because his dad showed up on Sunday. And when his dad got here, I said okay your dad's her God side and he's like what do I do I don't know what to do, i'm like well you're not going with him he's like. he's like took a deep breath and he's like okay good. He got like a. Something for his Nintendo switch or something from his dad and I went out there, and he was like thank you so much for coming out there, because I was very scared and i'm like you don't need to be scared. yeah you're not going with him it's not his weekend, you know it's like it's not you're not gonna you're not gonna go."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16129.0,Patient,"yeah but it's. In now we're getting ready for new year's Eve and stuff and that's you know we're all just hoping that next year is somewhat better because. We weren't really in the holiday spirit, you know we didn't set up for the holidays like we usually do it just was really kind of blahs a, I guess, just like last year, you know just this doesn't really feel like. there's a need to be. festive, I guess, but hopefully next year it'll be better."
759.0,Provider,yeah So hopefully next year will be better i'd be a little bit more festive.
16129.0,Patient,home hopefully.
759.0,Provider,"You know and it's hard to get into the Christmas spirit, in terms of how you feeling what's going on, you know it's hard to sometimes adjust to that yeah."
16129.0,Patient,"yeah it really, really is."
759.0,Provider,yeah but you do what you can it sounds like he did you can you know could do you know for Christmas.
16129.0,Patient,"yeah just you know I wanted my son to be happy and not stressed out and even though he was just a little bit on edge because Christmas happened to fall on the Saturday that he was supposed to go with his dad as a well it's my year. To have you for Christmas, so I don't care, you know it's. you're going to be with me. that's what the order says that's what you're gonna do you know and surprisingly enough wasn't really surprising, but his dad ended up not even. showing up or contacting us or anything you know he didn't. even bother to say Merry Christmas or anything it wasn't necessarily surprising, it was just like my son was on edge and very anxious because he couldn't. Like he couldn't relax you know, and it seems like that's happened to him, often this year and it's just like I hope that next year we can just not have that happen, and he can just relax you know and he's gonna be 16 next year and I can't believe it is growing up too fast."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"But yeah and Oh, I did my homework, I found I found an APP not really sure how much I really like."
759.0,Provider,us out.
16129.0,Patient,"I don't really it's like. It doesn't really feel like it does anything for me, other than just it asks me how i'm feeling at that moment for the day. Like if i'm happy or sad or whatever. And then, like that's it it's. It doesn't really it'll ask you to like write a note, if I want to. And that's like and I don't know like I tried several different ones, and I didn't like them, some of them I had to pay for, and I was just like no not gonna do that."
759.0,Provider,don't pay for it. don't pay for it yeah.
16129.0,Patient,"nope i'm not going to do that, so I I found one i'm trying it. Okay it's just kind of weird it's i've never done anything like that so it's just a little it's a little different for me, I guess."
759.0,Provider,"yeah to try to move in that way yeah. yeah do you think that's going to be something helpful, you know, like order, other than you telling me, you know, specifically what how you move this from day to day it says something going to be helpful for you keep track of."
16129.0,Patient,"I mean i've in all honesty i've never really done that, before i've never kept track of my my moods or even know that mood trackers exist. yeah. Let me, let me track my mood you know it's weird but i'm willing, you know just keep trying and and see if I can you know get myself to like it, because I know that you wanted me to try so."
759.0,Provider,"i've only been doing it first yeah let's yeah let's do for warmer week. as it goes. And it doesn't have to be Brent if you just paint today. i'm down because. of whatever it is write a little note to yourself are i'm happy today because such and such happened today. Are i'm feeling a little in between happiness and sadness, you know so just you know, being able to do that."
16129.0,Patient,"Okay okay i'll i'll keep trying, I know you like i'm giving you homework so i'm going to keep trying."
759.0,Provider,I don't.
16129.0,Patient,"Like to give up so i'll keep you know, keep at it and hopefully it. It sparked something you know, in my mind."
759.0,Provider,keep going because.
16129.0,Patient,i'm just not used to stuff like that.
759.0,Provider,Like.
16129.0,Patient,I used to journal a lot. But I. don't know if it's just because. I did it too much or i'm getting older it's just like I don't find myself doing it.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"Like as much as I used to, or even if at all. So. You know I did try to journal like you had me doing the beginning, but then it was just like I kind of just did it for a couple days, and then I was like. that's not really doing anything."
759.0,Provider,it's not really doing things.
16129.0,Patient,"Right yeah it wasn't so i'll give you know give this a shot and see how that works, and then I know you said that you were still trying to find."
759.0,Provider,"A book and I found the book press. OK email that to just give me one moment just email it to you real quick okay. Let me put back on my glasses, I can see the computer. Let me see if I can find it the listing actually on Amazon."
16129.0,Patient,Okay. Joseph.
759.0,Provider,Well i'm doing this tell me what you're gonna do for. New years.
16129.0,Patient,"um you know we we haven't really figured that out, yet I know that. My fiance should be off of work that day, because I know they had a three day weekend last weekend, so they should have another one, this weekend. And we're still kind of trying to figure out. You know what we're gonna do. We have kind of open the door for like some of our friends to come over, and you know just kind of hang out until the ball drops or whatever, but i'm not yeah i'm not really sure what we're what we're gonna do yet i'm. Just kind of. up in the air, at the moment, I mean we would obviously like to have company, but at the same time, you know, we want to. Be careful too, because it seems like a lot of people just you know up today, I was informed that two of my close friends got coven over Christmas and it's just you know I don't really want to. Risk getting sick so."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah you don't want to risk getting sick yeah, especially with your health insurance."
16129.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's i'm i'm at risk because of my asthma, but my son is is high high risk. Because of his immune issues and and has asthma as well, so you know we're all vaccinated here, and I know that you get still get it, even if you're vaccinated it's just not as lethal but still I you know I don't want to get sick at all."
759.0,Provider,Right I.
16129.0,Patient,"want to avoid it at all costs, but I mean. If we can you know, have a couple of people over and just kind of try to. You know just hang out and. bring in the New Year and enjoy time together or whatever, then. yeah that's fine and, if not we'll just do it just you know me and my fiance and my kid that's fine too, you know it's not really a necessity to. Have a gathering or. yeah you know just. yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah well whenever you do or Prince come over if you spend just time for fiance your son I hope it's a good ring in for the New Year okay thank.
16129.0,Patient,"You. No, I hope you have a good one too i'm sure you will."
759.0,Provider,Thank you tried to.
16129.0,Patient,"hey, you know as long as. We give it our best that's all we can we."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
16129.0,Patient,"yeah that's all we could do like I said, hopefully it just next year is. A lot better. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Whether I think just the fatigue of just being in a pandemic and not being able to navigate the world like we want could do yeah he's a different, even though we're trying to just adjust the best way that we can we fed to still kind of hard."
16129.0,Patient,"Oh yeah It really is, I mean it's you're at risk, no matter where you go in and i'm very thankful that. we've gone to you know when we have to go grocery shopping or doctor's appointments or whatever, and even my fiance going to work all the time i'm just like so grateful that none of us have gotten sick and we're okay. mm hmm because it's just scary and I don't it's it's horrible what. We hear about on the news and things like that and."
759.0,Provider,Right.
16129.0,Patient,"I mean it's it's sad that so many people are getting sick and they're just you know and a lot of them are unvaccinated so in all honesty it's kind of their own fault but same time you know it's men that I don't necessarily believe in vaccinations but. I wasn't gonna put. My life on the line, because I have a kid so he and I got vaccinated at the same time. And my my fiance he doesn't believe in vaccinations either, and he put it off for the longest time it's like i'm not gonna get i'm not going to get it, I don't need it, I don't want it it's a bunch of crap you know I don't believe in it. But then it was just like getting so much worse before this new variant on a cron came around, and it was just like you know I would feel better, and I think you would feel better if you just got it and you know. swallow your pride for a minute like I did, and just do it for you know. My son and me, you know you love us go ahead and you know show it and do it and even my mom she was just like you know you really need to get the vaccine, because you know she's worried about my son and everything. You know. He did he did so, you know that says a lot about the kind of person that he is, and I know he loves us genuinely so. yeah it helped him a lot at ease his. Because he has anxiety to not as bad as I have it, but you know. mellowed him out and he was able to get a job and go to work and not have any issues last week he started his new job so he's been he's been doing good and it's kind of taken a lot of. Stress off of me, because I know that he's feeling better and he's going to be able to not just help us but help himself, too, so you know I think I think a lot of that stress that I had it was just because I. i'm I was concerned with richards health and I just wanted him to be able to take care of himself. You know, not just us, because I know that taking care of yourself, is extremely important in order to care for other people, and sometimes we kind of. lag a little bit, and I know that I had oh gosh last year was worse than this year but. Man, I mean I think being put on lockdown was probably one of the hardest things anybody had to do and just not be able to go anywhere but."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,And so unfortunate that people were doing it anyway. Being dumb but then again it was a lot of younger people so. I guess that's what they're there for to rebel and be dumb and then face the consequences again.
759.0,Provider,"So yeah face the consequences, my second thicker thing."
16129.0,Patient,"Again they're wondering why but I heard that. There was something that just happened recently were like over almost 90 people got sick and and it was with the new the new variant and you know they're planning to. They might be planning to shut things down again because I know a lot of things here in California and my town where we live in modesto they've lot of stores and and places of employment they've. required that you know you wear a mask even if you're vaccinated like right now, they just they don't care they want you to be safe, you know and i'm like. that's good, but at the same time, it makes me really not want to go anywhere, so when i'm able to you know I try to get some of my groceries from like Amazon or whatever I need from Amazon, because I really don't want to leave my house, you know but. it's just like there's only so much we can do from home, sometimes we actually have to leave. yeah, especially if it's like the doctor that's why I was grateful when they said Oh, you know there's an option to do your your therapy at home and i'm like oh that's great that'll work for me because it's."
759.0,Provider,hard for me right.
16129.0,Patient,"it's uncomfortable you know, for me, because I have my chronic pain and everything but that you know, the only person that I have to take to therapy is my son, he has to go every Wednesday."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, he has in person Derby."
16129.0,Patient,"yeah his his was the only one that. required him to go in person, but it's not a problem it's not that far it's about maybe a little over 10 minute drive it's really not that far."
759.0,Provider,so good.
16129.0,Patient,"Just I don't like driving in the rain so i'm like Okay, I hope you know because it's been really rainy over here for a week or so and i'm like I don't feel like driving in the rain."
759.0,Provider,"Rain is like our snow like the east coast good snow, we got rain is kind of. Because they're not used to it, you know. Like almost every week but. we're not. we're not used to the rain over here."
16129.0,Patient,Where Where are you located.
759.0,Provider,i'm located near la in burbank. Oh yeah.
16129.0,Patient,"Okay yeah you guys don't get as much crappy. Now leave all that crappy weather does cuz oh man, I was like they're they're actually saying that we're supposed to get snow this year and modesto wow. They we never get snow over here never, ever, and I think it only snowed here like once maybe. love it maybe like 11 or 12 years ago I was a kid and it was like. it's snowing it's not supposed to snow here, it only snowed for like a little bit it didn't get all snowy on the ground or anything and I love the snow, but you know just like. I heard and then my my fiance Richard told me he was just like yeah it's supposed to rain or snow and rain and i'm like okay i'm down with that I like. to travel anywhere to go see snow, you can just see outside, but it hasn't snowed yet so i'm just like Oh well, you know it's better snow than hail, I do not like hail. That SAS oh. yeah horrible. Especially getting hit in the head with it, and then I get why we're glasses, so I gotta worry about it all the time."
759.0,Provider,"Yes, good yeah ahead of time yeah."
16129.0,Patient,"More like the cars, you know with the windshield and everything oh that's. Bad but yeah it's. over here is a cold it's been very, very cold, we had a freeze warning. For for last night, and it was freezing and it's still freezing today too."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"it's just like it's so cold, like all bundled up and we have all blankets and heater heating blankets and heating pads and everything everywhere it's cold. In your background today i'm like I wish I was."
759.0,Provider,"I was, I was there too."
16129.0,Patient,yeah. Not in the cold. Oh man.
759.0,Provider,"Hopefully won't be too much longer that we have the rain, you know only happens to us every so often So hopefully not too bad."
16129.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah with it this week.
16129.0,Patient,yeah. that's good at least it's not that bad where you're at and wish it wasn't that bad over here but. But that's okay i've lived here for oh my gosh i've lived here for a long time i'm here knows 10 so i've been.
759.0,Provider,i've been here for been there for.
16129.0,Patient,"26 years when Jesus Christ 26 years i've lived here, my goodness i've lived in my house or. Going on going on 14 years so."
759.0,Provider,i'll play lived in your House for about 14 years now.
16129.0,Patient,yeah we moved here when my son was too.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"he's gonna be 16 next year oh my God, I cannot believe it would been hit like this the longest i've lived anywhere."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"My own House because normally when I was you know young and I moved out, and I was living in different places, I was like kind of like a gypsy, I guess, and I didn't live anywhere, for too long, and I moved around all the time. And then I got pregnant, I was like oh I. can't do that anymore. So. Right and I was always careful I was always on birth control that I tried, a new birth control, and it said nope not gonna work for you, so I don't I have an iud now, which is like Fort Knox because when I got pregnant, I had a. New version."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"All those things suck because I got pregnant like I had a baby and that and I don't recommend that birth control that anybody. But I ED works. And that's nice too, because I don't have to I still have like the period symptoms, except. I don't lead every month, so that's Nice. saves me money. To do all that sanitary napkins stuff oh."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
16129.0,Patient,"Those little you know it is nice but not my mood swings and Richard is always like are you on your period and i'm like I think I don't know I guess i'm really mean. I could be really mean. I don't mean to but. i'm in pain all the time and then. it's just extra pain that women have to go through this. And that, and my cramps are a lot worse to because I had a C section. So it's a lot. more painful and I did ask the doctor about that because i'm like you know is that normal because it kind of feels like i'm going to rip open and."
759.0,Provider,And I don't know if that's not normal thing.
16129.0,Patient,yeah no it's it's normal but. What probably happened is when they when they closed me up they didn't close me properly. So i'm like great I got to live like this for the. rest of my life but it's fine like I just i'm used to it. But it's.
759.0,Provider,"Work is. That you have to go through right, we all have to go drink."
16129.0,Patient,"Everybody has to go through something. And yes, no I try to just fight the bit and make the most of it but. Right now it's not always easy, I think that's why i've always sought out any kind of medical help that I can get because you know, I just want to stick around and be a mom as long as I can, and he. He my son always worried he's just like if you watch us something sad on TV, or if we watch a movie or something it happens to be like a. Mother son scene, or something and it's sad, you know, like or the mom dies or something he gets so emotional he'll like just fall in my lap is going to die, and like I don't want to either i'm very afraid of it, but you know it's just it's inevitable it's something that we all do. yeah every every living creature on this planet does you know we all live we all die it just it's it sucks but. And I don't like constantly being reminded you know about it, but it. Just because it freaks me out and. I don't know. Like certain times are worse than others, and I think it's because my anxiety to it kind of makes me freak out more when i'm reminded you know that. At a certain point in my life I won't be breathing anymore it scares me."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,And I don't know it's just it always some. It a recurring thing so.
759.0,Provider,"As a recurring thing, have you always felt like that."
16129.0,Patient,"um when growing up, I didn't i'm unlike as a teenager obviously I wasn't really focused on that, so I didn't really start thinking about it until I think it was probably. um. I think it was my. My second. relationship of being in a second domestic violent relationship, I was in I think i'm at a certain point. You know, I was hurt very bad and. He actually choked me. And I. Could not breathe nice I like there was no catching my breath or anything I just couldn't breathe at all. And it scared me, I mean I know they show in movies, you know people are getting choked and they can fight back at that point, I was frozen, as he was choking me I couldn't move, I wanted to. Like my brain I was like I wanted to fight back, but I froze because I didn't realize what was happening, and then, when I did. I just you know it scared me, and I think that might have been what made it worse."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,But I really i'm not really sure what made it turn into a phobia I don't know um.
759.0,Provider,"Well, definitely being towed being you know, like. yeah he could have. done, you know he came into your life, and that is sent. in and out of the. game and. yeah and I have to go through something like that I young gave you know, like would traumatize anyone, you know the scared of the fact that you might not be able to believe you know in that moment, you can improve."
16129.0,Patient,"yeah that was it was scary it really was I just I didn't know what what to do, and it was just. it's definitely depicted differently, and anything that has to do with. TV or movies, or anything like that you know they're not they're not really doing it, they just look like they're doing it. And the person will function. yeah I was just like I wanted to my brain was telling my body hey fight back you know your something is going wrong, but I couldn't move it was weird I don't know if it was like my my ptsd or what it was that I already had."
759.0,Provider,been.
16129.0,Patient,"Like. yeah I couldn't and I wanted to. uh huh because I am a fighter, and I put up a pretty big fight and normally. But in that time it just was really bad."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16129.0,Patient,So it definitely made her.
759.0,Provider,"Name right at that moment you didn't know what to do so, your body to. shut down on you."
16129.0,Patient,"It did yeah. It was it was scary. I know when Richard and I first started hanging out, and you know we we ended up both kind of telling our stories. You know, as we ended up becoming a couple, and we were getting closer and things like that you know, and I told him more and more, and he was just getting more and more upset is like, if I ever see any of them, you know. i'm gonna beat their ass and i'm like well it's not there's really no reason to do that. Because it was a long time ago and I would rather just avoid the drama altogether I don't want you know to be around them, and there is only. One that I know of that is still in my town and is not very far from me, and it does scare me to think that one one of these days, we can run into each other, you know because I don't want to run into him. Right cuz he was also someone that that did that to me as well, he choked me also but I ended up. A lot worse. Right, he did want to end my life, so it was very scary."
759.0,Provider,yeah face scary.
16129.0,Patient,"No, no, and it didn't do anything but just add on to my already traumatic. You know."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. So while you're in a good position now like, I hope you feel safe now with. yeah."
16129.0,Patient,"You feel safe I do feel safe, with him, I know that, because of my past i'm not the easiest person to be with and i'm not. i'm not the most lovable person because there's a lot of times, he tells me, you know, and he has been telling me a lot lately, you know he wants me to cuddle with him and he wants, you know more affection and attention and it's just like like I told you a couple weeks ago, you know I. try my best to cuddle with him for as long as I possibly can. But after a while. I just start to feel trapped like I can't get out."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,And I really feel like that has a lot to do with. The trauma that I experienced with being in those relationships that I.
759.0,Provider,could not get out of pressure.
16129.0,Patient,"And a lot of the time you know they would hold me down and do things to me so. it's like I know he's not going to do that, and he says that a lot he's like i'm not gonna do that to you, though, and I said I know that."
759.0,Provider,"But know your body still reacting that way. yeah body's telling you like your mind your body like you know, like, I might be in danger, so that danger signal you know that flight signal comes out and you want to flee."
16129.0,Patient,"yeah it does and that's another reason why I was you know. They diagnosed me with ptsd because it's. Just a. it's a trigger and. I don't I don't mean to be that way, because I do love Richard very much obviously we've been together for over five years. You know I wouldn't. keep investing in so much time with him if I wasn't happy and I didn't feel safe it's just and I, and I do. apologize to him a lot, you know for for not for feeling like i'm not a good enough partner, he says, I am."
759.0,Provider,But.
16129.0,Patient,"You know, then when he says things like he needs more attention and more cuddling and stuff I feel bad because. I want to do those things for him, but I can't give him as much that you know as much as he wants. And it's because of my issues. I want him to understand that I am fully aware that he would never hurt me and he's not gonna do to me what they did. Right, but I want them to understand that that's it's trauma."
759.0,Provider,"Yes, trauma right."
16129.0,Patient,I just feel bad.
759.0,Provider,Because you want to give him why he wants and seeing you want to do you want to be quote unquote a normal person and run comes to intimacy. But you realize that because of your past and your past trauma that it's hard for you to be intimate in those moments.
16129.0,Patient,yeah it is.
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And sounds like he's understanding, you know, like very understanding."
16129.0,Patient,"For the most part yeah I mean he does get really irritated sometimes because, like i'm either Moody or mean or I just give him a little bit you know, and I know it's not as much as he would want."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,And I feel bad. Because I want him to know you know I love him I do I very deeply but. it's like. i'm not giving him enough of what he wants and I. am afraid that i'll push him away.
759.0,Provider,yeah you're afraid that you might push him away.
16129.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Because i've done it before um. and It was. It was pretty you know tough, for me, because I knew that it was my fault. But at the same time, that person didn't understand. My mental health issues and my traumatic. experiences and past so. You know yeah it was bad, but at the same time, it was like and it really care because they didn't understand or sympathize at all. Right, he does. But I just. wish that I could be a better partner and do more for for him, because I, I am very scared that I will you know push him away to the point where he isn't going to want to deal with it anymore. Because I mean I already you know can't have kids and that's something that he wanted."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"But he chose to stay with me, knowing that it can't."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16129.0,Patient,So yeah.
759.0,Provider,Are you worried about him possibly leaving because of those issues.
16129.0,Patient,uh huh. yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Well, sounds like you guys have good communication, which is nice year, but the talk with each other and think just communicating you know, while that in to the point of on the same page of what you want. to your life look like together in the future, you know, being able to kind of put in perspective, you know what you guys intentions are what his intentions are in a relationship and just making sure you guys share the same values and the same wants and desires. You know, like in terms of how you want your relationship to look like in the future that's all we can do you know he seems as though, like he loves you a lot, and he has put in five years of work into the relationship and he seems like someone that wants to stick it out with him."
16129.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I know i'm not the easiest person to be with, but he sure does. put up with my shit he really does. I mean, and I, and I know that that's you know that's a good thing, because I feel like a lot of people that I know. Whether it be friends or family that have been in relationships, for many, many years you know they. If they can tolerate each other's bullshit, then you know. So me. And it's. You know now it's just I want to. be better for him because I don't want him to run off like you know the other one did, and for me it's. i'm i'm doing the best that I can, little by little. Like the other, the other morning, I think it was Monday actually think it was yesterday morning. I happen to wake up before my alarm and I went into the bedroom because. I can't sleep next to him, because he moves around and kicks too much, and he snores really loud. I went into the bedroom and he was still asleep. Somehow I didn't wake him up normally I wake him up as soon as I opened the door, but went in there and I laid next to him and I just you know I kind of held on to him. He was still sleeping and I held on to him for probably about 10 minutes and then he woke up. And he didn't realize that I had been in there and he's like what are you doing in here and then he was happy, you know because I was with them and then. I did I laid with him for a little while and and then I kept looking at the time i'm like okay it's time you got to get up you got to get ready for work, so I could take you to work. And he was like no, we have a couple more minutes and I was just like no you got to get up you know it's just an easy way for me to. kind of get out of it. um um. I just and it's so strange because. I don't understand why mean I do understand, but I don't at the same time, you know why I feel like I need to. get away."
759.0,Provider,get away from him yeah.
16129.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to be awake you know I don't I don't know why I feel like i'm. Trapped or can't escape you know just from cuddling."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"And it's it's very odd because I want it, but at the same time, when I do. interact that way with him and cuddle him, I can only do it for so long before i'm like okay that's enough, but he he's not ready to stop, and I am. and on Monday morning it was just an easier way for me to get out because he knew he had to get up and get ready for work so it's just an easier way for me to take advantage and say okay it's time to get up and get ready. mm hmm so. that's what happened, and you know yeah he was disappointed. And it did make me feel bad I did cry about it on the way home after dropping him off because I did feel bad. yeah um it's. that's not a very good thing to feel like you know i'm not a good enough partner, even though he tells me that I am. mm hmm it's I know that i'm not doing. I feel like i'm not doing enough, even though he says, I am i'm not doing enough of what he needs."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"And i'm not used to being that kind of partner i'm used to be the kind of person who's always you know affectionate and wanting love and wanting to be with my partner, all the time. But. You know, and I know it comes from all of my. My Travel and in my past and it's i'm a lot better than they used to be, because. I am in a relationship. I mean, now that is huge. Because that is a lot for me as. A little after me I. I had a hard time even trying to have relationships after. My last violent relationship, it was hard. I didn't want you know to be with anybody, and then, if I. found myself with someone it was just you know. Not that long maybe like a week or a couple weeks, and it was just. kind of like. Sometimes your goal, you know i'm not going to do this, but with Richard it's been a lot different. And so. I. feel like you know I will, I know I could do better, but i'm just thankful that he is so. Understanding, I mean he doesn't understand all the time, but there are times, where he, like really gets it he's like no i'm good, because he has his own traumas. But for me it's just. And i'm always attracted to you know the big strong men. He is a big tall strong man, and you know, sometimes it's intimidating to me because the men that i've been with in the past they hurt me. And they were big and tall, and it was just like okay. But that's what i'm attracted to."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16129.0,Patient,"with him, I know he isn't going to hurt me. mm hmm I sat in the back of my head like."
759.0,Provider,He could.
16129.0,Patient,"He could he could. He could snap and get mad, and you know he could hurt me without realizing what he's doing you know it happens for humans, sometimes we do things like that I know that you know I have i've snapped and gotten mad. and acted in a way that I normally wouldn't. But you know not hurting anybody physically because I just wouldn't I can't do that. But. I just. And I do communicate with him, I know you said, we have good communication, sometimes we do sometimes we don't. Sometimes i'll do my best to communicate with him and he just doesn't want to hear it. Okay um. He is open with me, but sometimes you know it's like i'm supposed to be a ninth grader and know what's going on with him. And i'm like I don't know what's wrong with you, I don't know why you're in a mood or what's going on with you, you know and then he'll tell me and i'm like Okay, you know that's all i'm asking for is just for you to be able to talk to me. so that I can understand the situation and what's going on. Because i'm not. going to know without it. So. Any lately that's just kind of what has been happening is just he's been meeting more attention and i'm not you know, giving him enough of it."
759.0,Provider,"yeah well you do what you can and what you physically feel like you can do you know you don't want to. Over burdening yourself with too much you know, like in terms of your past and to now and the way that is effective to this present day you don't want to overly do it, too, when you start to feel unsafe or fill my you know that you're in danger, put it that way."
16129.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"With the feelings of feeling like you're going to be trapped, you know you do what you can and just communicate what you can and can't not do, and hopefully with understanding hard to be willing to listen to and to give you some you know some compassion. In terms of how you're feeling. Now yeah."
16129.0,Patient,Okay well definitely do that that's good advice.
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah um but really you know, like you're holding your own you know, in terms of you know cuz it can be a lot more worse, you know you can be shutting down completely. So it just shows that you're a strong person that you haven't shut down completely like you're still going to try things you're still willing to push yourself and to keep on going that says a lot."
16129.0,Patient,"About. Thanks, sometimes I don't always feel that way but it's Nice, you know to be told that, especially from someone that i'm you know, depending on for help, so thank you Nadia I appreciate."
