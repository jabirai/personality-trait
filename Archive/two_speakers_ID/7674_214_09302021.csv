214.0,Provider,"What about relationship for you, where were you I would."
7674.0,Patient,"I tried it and I just. I just clear clearly still have time for it to have a candy here. um I just don't have the time so I tried something out with. My friend Damien but during the weekend I just don't have the time to even focus on that and it's so frustrating because I don't want to be mean like i'm not trying to. ignore the person, but, honestly they're just not my priority right now and I seem like an asshole, but I just don't have the time for it."
214.0,Provider,"So let me ask you a question how, on one hand it's great to hear, but nobody how How does that make you feel like you like you know what I just don't got time for things I got a wave amanda the wave of my daughter I got over my."
7674.0,Patient,"it's super frustrating because I want to get married. arbitron sure. And what is like I don't know I just think once everything like with core and DIY and I just don't have a lot on my plate, then I can focus on. A little bit older maybe she's only for so she still needs a lot of attention, a lot of caring for but yeah right now it's just not my I tried it but."
214.0,Provider,"yeah, but I just want to give you credit and validation like you know you I don't want to show you this to sound like a real. mean, but like it's about being an adult we got to make adult decisions we don't have to like them, but we got to make adult decisions and. If we can't you know we can't manage it all, do we have to make decisions on, we have to manage what's most important and then we'll figure out things from there, so that's kind of what you just said. Yes, okay. yeah i'm how well let's take a look at this fall we're here. To."
7674.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"So your surveys with Depression and anxiety, this one is five you think that's a good reflection of where you are with your anxiety and depression."

214.0,Provider,"Was funny because in July, you was 00."
7674.0,Patient,"Really, I just honestly think it's whenever my court dates are. Absolutely, because I feel like. Once it's done i'm fine, I have no anxiety, so it has to be done it's annoying as hell. But well that'll be interesting for me to remember."
