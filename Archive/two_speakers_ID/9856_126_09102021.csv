126.0,Provider,Oh wow.
9856.0,Patient,"I didn't go last week or this or this this week so far yeah so yeah I haven't been in for a while, so it's kind of kind of good. it's kind of expect to. kind of get suspense it all the time, like $15 $16."
126.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah. yeah I always try to use coupons I pull your logo they always have combined.
9856.0,Patient,yeah yeah So if you pretty expensive for.
126.0,Provider,Eating out has gotten very expensive yeah.
9856.0,Patient,yeah even if you go to McDonalds you right here like $100 you get a combo it'll run you at least.
126.0,Provider,"10 bucks I know which is ridiculous, because I remember when mcdonald's first came out the hamburgers were 19 cents. wow 19 cents, the Fries were 1515."
9856.0,Patient,That is that.
126.0,Provider,mcdonald's is so.
9856.0,Patient,"it's pretty. varies like. depends, where you're at I feel like I feel like it's better like Las Vegas. And the prices up there is like ridiculous. Like when. When was a while back when like 2007 yeah when in 2017 and I remember, I went and the combo was around like 12 bucks. 12 bucks for a combo. Regular make this the regular big MAC the Fries and a coke. Was $12."
126.0,Provider,"that's ridiculous. You can buy a philemon jaan for that. You know everything's getting expensive via just the groceries in the. door are getting expensive, you know they're talking to all the truck drivers that there's less and less truck drivers on the road so even though there's lots of things to deliver there's not enough people driving trucks. So right now we're having a short. of everything."
9856.0,Patient,connects. So connect showing off sorry.
126.0,Provider,yeah I know for a second.
9856.0,Patient,I heard I seen something on that on it on social media about the truck driver they're short yeah that really young short on drivers or something like that.
126.0,Provider,"yeah so whereas you might have 10. or now there's only five truck. Drivers delivering to a store. So they're not getting all their merchandise and now they're charging more for it. But, and that all goes to. You know people calling out sick from. And so many people do not want to go back to work they'd rather just you know collecting unemployment."
9856.0,Patient,"yeah I was gonna say something about didn't just stop recently I heard, I see something on tetsuo something about like everybody's got the unemployment benefits cuts are there there's no more or something like that."
126.0,Provider,"I think, at the end of September, either, that or September 13 one of those one of those dates. But yeah but people can still keep you know they haven't been on unemployment, all this time, they can still you know file so like every day, more and more people are filing for unemployment rate than working. Where. We were there, you know we're hiring science."
9856.0,Patient,"Actually that's funny because I have a friend is like that he collected unemployment and I tell him, you know I totally do like we do all day. yeah he likes he likes his children like it's hardly like he seems like he's like i'm gonna lie to you, I do I didn't get my ass i'm good at our ad like there's only a blemish It is like it's not even cutting my nails either like."
126.0,Provider,"it's like half of what you would normally get plus you know I. mean you got to feel like you have a purpose, you know, to get up in the morning to get your motivated if you're just sitting home playing video games every day what motivation do now. I can understand you."
9856.0,Patient,know.
126.0,Provider,Is this a bad connection for you to.
9856.0,Patient,"It there's a lot of people that actually do that sure well I just got a new phone that's why. yeah, so I think that's probably why."

9856.0,Patient,yeah you know that I liked. I shouldn't. I just when I when I see something and I like it. Like. You become obsessed with it. So I.
126.0,Provider,"asked myself like Do I really need these do I have some shoes that look. Just like these, and then I try to figure out well I don't have any more room in my closet So if I put one more pair of shoes in I have to give away a pair if I one more T shirt in my closet i'm not going to buy more hangers i've got a giveaway T shirt. And that's what I do I figure out what happened, I warned, for a long time because i'm not going to keep adding more and more hangers every time I get a T shirt I have. An old T shirt out and give it away before I put a new T shirt on my anger. Is same with shoes same with pants I only have. Limited fingers."
9856.0,Patient,or no.
126.0,Provider,"yeah so I end up with bags I take. To the women's battered shelter, which I love taking bags of clothes over there, I love it. But yeah so buying the shoes, I see so many shoes that I would want. And I really try to analyze it now don't don't have a pair of shoes like that. Because I that's what i'm mostly interested in shoes more than close the pants and. He sure, does the shoes."
9856.0,Patient,Oh yeah you're totally right about that I see i'm not I don't know why I like that one I did something I tried it I don't know like I have T shirt right here for like three or four years ago we some of them still with the tag on. yeah it's funny I don't know why I like I haven't been hanging right here and it's still at the tag on and i've been warning them yeah yeah.
126.0,Provider,"So what does that what does that tell you, you have it, you have it hanging there with the tags on you still have a warning."
9856.0,Patient,It just tells me. Oh.
126.0,Provider,That you don't need any more new clothes till you were the.
9856.0,Patient,Is. So much blow you don't need it. So yeah that's my short term the short term goal that I was just start saving enough money for my car.
126.0,Provider,Okay perfect all right.
9856.0,Patient,"My long term one is the main one for me is to stay sober most definitely that's, the main one, just as long as possible with. The pills, and the heroin and all that. I want to get away from. All that as much as possible, even with even denzel pills everything. So. pretty much the long term or."

When I took my life when I took a yeah I I found some pills, I was looking through my drawers and stuff and I found some pills like I don't even know where I had them I just I just had them right there and I. took them, you know I took them and I I was the last time I I didn't know. Three and a half, four months ago."
126.0,Provider,"Okay, I was just checking to see when you when did you join. ski."
9856.0,Patient,"yeah it was like in April, I believe. mistaken for March, because I haven't remember, I was supposed to start on March, but something happened with my insurance thing, so I didn't joined a group until like a couple weeks later, like three weeks or a month later."

126.0,Provider,"That yes. I wonder, like because you're going to be tested like that. I mean you're not in a bubble you don't live in a bubble you're going to be tested like that. Some days someone's just going to pull it right out, and you know, want to offer it to you or or you're there smoking it and you see them and you pass by them and. you're going to have to be able to you know what am I going to do it, you know, but since you've had this experience it seems like you've gotten to a point in your recovery where now you've passed that virgin that craving and no more into commitment to recovery."
