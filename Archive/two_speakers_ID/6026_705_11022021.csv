6026.0,Patient,The kids dressed up. My stuff she was Tina Turner she was dancing like Tina Turner.
705.0,Provider,"How fun. Yes, Okay, but you just weren't in the morning, the mood to dress up, but you have fun."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, I like to dress up for Halloween."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I had just like I handed out some candy and did some little glow bracelets, but I have just like a little cat mask off that on and that's about extent of it. Oh wasn't a good to see the kids out again and dressing up this year."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, but we didn't really get any many trick or treaters we got one giant group of trick or treaters i'm not sure how many there were."
705.0,Provider,Okay neat okay well good so that was probably something definitely a little bit out of the ordinary. What are some other things that have come up since last time we met.
6026.0,Patient,Nothing really the negative self talk has been better since last week so that's great.
705.0,Provider,"Okay kimmy can you give me an example like did were you aware of it, and you utilize it and it worked."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, so usually i'm having more self talk and i'm usually. You know. After I had the negative stuff I do the positive self talk to tanner after it was just a lot less negative self talk than usual so that's great."
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that is great that's exactly. What it's like designed to do is for you to become more aware and then, when you're aware to put that positive self statement. Right okay. Have you noticed more now that you've been become aware of, with it, is it a certain thing that you always tell yourself."
6026.0,Patient,"Oh. Well i'm telling myself i'm a terrible person I tell myself i'm a good person i'm telling myself. That i'm stupid and no say i'm smart i'm intelligent. But yeah it's usually the same thing some stupid on. and You know those type of things on terrible on this have access, have a lot of low self esteem insecurities lack of self where those type of things."
705.0,Provider,"Quiet is it been helpful than to dig in there and see the evidence against what you're saying that, oh no no Okay, yes yeah. And to keep adding to your list as you go along, like the list that's that's against you know and proving to you that you're very intellectual, you are not stupid yeah do you you help your nephew you figure out all kinds of things you're creative. You think outside the box and this skill this skill, not everybody grasp on to and you even did that."
6026.0,Patient,They know.
705.0,Provider,yeah. Absolutely what other times do you feel smart like you're putting your capabilities up there.
6026.0,Patient,But that's a bigger technology out there selling your something out on the phone the. The computer or the tablet or the TV.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. you're absolutely right and to add all that in your list of hang on a minute, you know. You figured out to how to work with bright heart health and to get into all the meetings and take all the surveys. that's not an easy task."
6026.0,Patient,No it's not.
705.0,Provider,"there's there's some to Asia that it just even with practice that they haven't quite been able to get that but your mind is more technology savvy where you get. What are some other things that you can put in the instead of the know you know, the low self worth that you are Where were they."
6026.0,Patient,Just that i'm. i'm a kind person.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6026.0,Patient,I like helping people i'm carrying.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. You have empathy to for others, is sometimes people have that."
6026.0,Patient,that's true once on people don't have sympathy but yes MP3 doesn't come as easy to some people.
705.0,Provider,"But time and time again, I hear you share that you should that you do have empathy. Not only caring, I would say to to your family your loyal your Daddy kane. trustworthy. You feel like you're an honest person."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, but I feel like I need to work on being more honest with myself sometimes i'm just. just say all these things that sometimes it's like. Counterfeit this ordinance and my mind, is telling me the wrong things sometimes just things i'm telling myself just to cope."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. If you were more honest with yourself what would that be like.
6026.0,Patient,I think it'd be more freeing. Because I wouldn't be living. With things that aren't true that are hindering me.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6026.0,Patient,"I will see things as they are, I see myself as I am."
705.0,Provider,"Sometimes part of that also is, as we began to discover who we are authentically is that it's like the mask exercise that we did and. where you can allow yourself to put down that mask and just be you. And even that takes some self discovery since you've been changing."
6026.0,Patient,and growing off oh. i'm just learning what works and what doesn't work and trial and error.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. and learning through that too is that you're resilient you're reliable, like you, can you can trust yourself your gut feeling tell you what to do."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, and not second guess myself or thinking. As Fuck. Talking myself out what I really feel."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. A lot of times that initial self talk is just out of enzymes it and what we used to be in the past, but it doesn't line up with who we are today. Walsall mm hmm. yeah. From the mask exercise was there anything you know that you were able to identify that maybe you put on the outside of your mask and then on the inside, you put something different."
6026.0,Patient,not really.
705.0,Provider,"If if that that Aisha in that example alone to me shows that you're more in balance, because when we can portray outside and we don't have as many mask and it aligns with who we truly are then we get to be us, you know. yeah. Anything that that you've realized, so far, through this like therapy process about what you can rely on for yourself."
6026.0,Patient,"I know prayer and God, I may feel like if I didn't have God and prayer. i'm not sure i'll be alive, I mean i've been through a lot of things that. could have ended horribly. And just how I feel emotionally and just could be. You know, with the mania getting out of control and. trying to get back even and so hard and being manic for months and or being so depressed that I can barely talk or move. So it's like. Without prayer and God and people caring for me I don't think I could have gotten through it and. Just friends and family being there for me and church family. And just trying to do what's best for myself yeah. Like sometimes I want a glass or two of wine and I don't have a problem with alcohol or anything but it's like it might feel good, then, but it could affect me negatively later."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. Is that something I should that's been on your your mind.
6026.0,Patient,"No, I don't really think about alcohol much because I was never a big drinker so no."
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah it just sometimes maybe if others are over, something that looks good for a moment and then you think through."
6026.0,Patient,"Well, not even have to think it through, because i'm just like no alcohol."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you say that with lake confidence. Because you've made your own decision. yeah i'm not part of discovering to who we are, as. Just do we need this outside stuff do we. You know."
6026.0,Patient,"emotional eater I struggle with that sometimes in. Trying like when i'm having anxiety, I might eat. then go to sleep, because I have the anxiety and i'm not really that hungry, but it's just more of the anxiety. Trying to like either talk myself until something healthy or not do it at all, maybe have like a boat, or we brand cereal instead of something sweet or fattening."
705.0,Provider,that's that's a healthy choice and it's good how you're like weighing it out. And is there room also for every now and then splurging rewarding yourself and not having to be as healthy.
6026.0,Patient,"Well done, that earlier in the day I tend to I like to eat more early in the day, but I want to splurge have it early in the day, just don't have it before I go to sleep."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's that's you should coming up with your own strategies of what's going to work for you then. Quite. It is a you know I heard earlier, you were talking about that you've made it through, because of prayer you made it through, because of family and friends. And all that nothing as an issue that without you."
6026.0,Patient,"That is true. Some people. They don't they'll believe in God, but they don't want to take the time to pray."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. you've taken the initiative, though, to bring that closer and have. Something that hey This is my belief and i'm going to lean on that. yeah. Has it been to where. Now, you should the because you you've learned more about yourself. And how even with anxiety. Are you like, at a point where you're like okay enough of this i'm going to take control to with anxiety anxiety isn't me it's a part of sometimes my challenges."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm starting to feel less anxious, in general, still i'm driving more often, but i'm still haven't been able to drive out of town and I figure, you know. The coven gets more I mean more under control, and I feel more comfortable I will eventually Drive Out of town. Just the next town over."
705.0,Provider,When you're ready to. write this to me already just for you to be able to get in the car and feeling less anxious is huge.
6026.0,Patient,"So sometimes I would drive somewhere and i'll be fine driving there, but on the way back i'm like i'm anxious about getting a crash or something bad happening i'll just have to talk myself like you can do this you'll get home safely."
705.0,Provider,"I remember when we first met that you said you knew that about yourself. it's more of a way back. Is is that, then any changes so when you go somewhere and you're coming back."
6026.0,Patient,"Well, one thing that helps if I have the hair conditioner on high makes me cold but. Have looks into it with the air condition. yeah this feeling, because i'm driving if you're feeling more comfortable."
705.0,Provider,yeah that confidence level going up each time that it's like I did it I did it I did it creating that new pathway.
6026.0,Patient,just trying to go in the mornings were not as many people on the road and as many people in the store.
705.0,Provider,"it's finding your way and that's what i'm hearing. Time time with you Asia is you're finding your way and what. Is your comfort zone. Can you add those to your list of things to when you're like that self esteem, to be like i'm figuring this out it's not only figuring it out you've done it. you're implementing things that you said you were going to do."
6026.0,Patient,"Not show following through. Everything every time I do something I check things off my lips, and that makes me feel better just trying like not trying to procrastinate and put things off that will make me more anxious just in the back of my mind, no one I need to do something and not doing it."
705.0,Provider,yeah. and anxiety with driving can really be debilitating and stop. PS driving again.
6026.0,Patient,"At one point, I was driving once a week or maybe less than that so i've come a long way."
705.0,Provider,"heck yeah. You have and to hear where today you're like hey when i'm ready i'll leave and drive over to the next town, if I see like something they're. worth my time and energy. yeah okay. All that again with anxiety, it can be like really stop you in your boots and learning to have more trust within yourself. Right mm hmm. In the book when we talked about like catastrophizing any catching yourself catastrophizing."
6026.0,Patient,"I do, that a lot."
705.0,Provider,hi.
6026.0,Patient,"I don't do it as much anymore, but it will be like the littlest thing like if I don't wash my hands properly i'm going to get sick it's gonna be really bad. My end up in the hospital I don't do that as much anymore for little things like washing my hands or washing my fruits and vegetables so actually I don't really think I do that at all anymore, but it looks like the littlest things i'm like. Well, if there's a disaster."
705.0,Provider,"that's another area to that you know you can check off he shows you that you used to have a lot of what ifs and what else would grow more what ifs and then feeling overwhelmed. Right you've learned how to manage and bring that back. decrease your worrying. You know that's another if we look at it, as it usually driving worrying, I mean you remember in the book Those are some of the two most common."
6026.0,Patient,Right.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm and that you've overcome it because you have tools now.
6026.0,Patient,What is.
705.0,Provider,Good. How has it been then for social support.
6026.0,Patient,"Oh. i'm not well one friend, I need to call her more often period other friend we're just like shoot I usually don't call her because she knows. She works from home and she goes to school from home and she has two kids young kids so usually she would call me but we're not talking as much as often because she's so busy so it's like but. One of my friend, she was having trouble with her phone so she can receive my text, and I can get her text so now that she can that's better morning communication and the other friend I just, even if I don't talk to her we communicate through tech so that's good just to keep in contact."
705.0,Provider,"was to issue a think it's been several weeks now that there was a friend and that there had been some grief, I wanted to check into where you are with grieving."
6026.0,Patient,I feel a lot better feeling more at peace.
705.0,Provider,Is that something to that you're able to share with some of your friends that knew the same person.
6026.0,Patient,"Well, they didn't know him okay."
705.0,Provider,This was somebody that you had like a personal relationship with. What are some of the things that you filled in that you're more at you said at peace and that's a good place to be right. uh huh what brought you to get to that point.
6026.0,Patient,"i'm just saying. To myself, he said peace now there's no more. medical tests there's no more surgeries no more wearing. Let me know what he needs me to let me know before he passed and just. glad that he's at rest and glad he will say something which he wanted me to know before he passed so that makes me feel better."
705.0,Provider,i'm sensing to that you understood and that empathy piece where for him not to be in pain anymore.
6026.0,Patient,"yeah but. No, just so young, to pass away, but he had a lot of health issues. hit me. yeah he knew the kidney transplant."
705.0,Provider,How does he.

6026.0,Patient,"Just being so young. You know. With think at 37 there's so much more life to live, but that's not always the case yeah."
705.0,Provider,"That is the piece where it's just like yeah it's not always the case, and having to just sit on that and be like gosh it's beyond my control."
6026.0,Patient,"But Mr felt he wasn't going to get the transplant, in time, but I didn't know how bad a shape, he was in."
705.0,Provider,yeah and he may also issue wanted to keep that more private to protect.
6026.0,Patient,You right.
705.0,Provider,"I know, sometimes it's too soon and that door is not open yet, is there a possibility, in the future that maybe the doors open to have a different relationship interest."
6026.0,Patient,"Well, we did it so long ago, so it really wasn't anything romantic between us. It was more of a friendship for many years. and I broke up with my last word friend over two years ago. Just what the cove it and the anxiety. just trying to work on my mental health i'm kind of interested in seeing what's out there, but. Not enough to really date."
705.0,Provider,"But you're considering it. And you deserve. to share, you know you and your thoughts and your love with someone when you're ready."
6026.0,Patient,i'll show.
705.0,Provider,"Today it looks I mean to connect with people in dating sometimes you don't even meet them in person, yet."

705.0,Provider,How that could be refreshing to actually like become friends with someone and then see. If anything to romantic relations definitely. Is there some things that usually for you that's really important that you look for.
6026.0,Patient,Honesty good sense of humor down to earth.
705.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay well you downloaded that the APP and that's an action step. So, so a part of like do you feel like maybe you might start exploring it or."
6026.0,Patient,"Well, because I just remembered I had the APP and. So i'll get around to it eventually."
705.0,Provider,"Okay it's not on the to do list. No okay what's more more. Presently, on the to do lists."

705.0,Provider,"I see a smile behind that I get it get it where it's been nice to share with family but you're ready to retreat and. All have your own space. yeah. If you know if we talk about depression, are you feeling like any signs of depression."
6026.0,Patient,"i'm feeling a lot better than I usually feel usually i'm at least a little depressed so i'm feeling more even. Okay, even though i'm bipolar I tend to be more depressed."
705.0,Provider,"Oh. Even I bet you would take any day over maybe what you used to do with with the depression. card. yeah if you're feeling even to. A Shin you're getting more you're more mindful of okay what's going on for me it's nice to know, you can count on your tolls, you know, in your resources. Because if you need like any medical our medicine, you know adjustments is talking to show and tell."
6026.0,Patient,"Oh, my medicine is fine right now."
705.0,Provider,it's like yes it's good when you. figure it out and it's like yes. This is where I need to be.
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, because I get nervous about adjusting my medication, because I don't want to be pushed into mania."
705.0,Provider,"Through. yeah and so being able to take it and be like okay. And the more that you know, and the more that you can communicate with chantel that she can help you to monitor and see if she feels like okay if you're starting to feel this way let's take a look at this. yeah well, I think you know, again, is you've done a lot of work where. how you feel about yourself your esteem starting to increase also to being able to have those like tools and resources, we talked about that make counter. Is all that satisfying for you."

6026.0,Patient,What is so.
705.0,Provider,"I think that again that you have and so many different areas really proven yourself, where you know that you are worthy that you are super intelligent and that when you're ready and you want to find you know if it's love out there again that you're ready for that."
6026.0,Patient,film.

6026.0,Patient,I don't think so quite.
705.0,Provider,"Well, we will meet again and I know you should they have the 30 minutes for the next time too, but if you want to start thinking about if you want more time we can we can do more time add to some of those when we can on the schedule so think about it and see. And then. If there's a certain direction you want to take. to learn about I mean sometimes people will be like Valerie want to learn more anger management, then we go down that route, so people are more communication we go down that route."
6026.0,Patient,I do need help with communication and we help with dealing with past trauma.
705.0,Provider,"Let me ask you this, too, I know we're getting to closing but would you be interested in seeing if maybe you're a candidate for. A more of the tap therapy for for the trauma."
6026.0,Patient,"Yes, I want to do that."
705.0,Provider,"Because I know we have someone on board, right now, let me see I know they have like a criteria, and so let me see if maybe we can at least have them meet with you and."
6026.0,Patient,i'll tell them.
705.0,Provider,My supervisor does that okay.
6026.0,Patient,sounds good that sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"yeah cuz i'll let her know that at this point that maybe you know starting to work you have all the coping skills and you're in a good place to now maybe start to address the trauma and then that would be I think Cindy Gonzales is her name that does that. On so that would you know we can talk about it more the next time, but I want to go ahead and put that out there if you're. you're willing to explore it."
6026.0,Patient,I do.
