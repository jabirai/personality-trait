The dentist did her exam she told me, I have a bunch of dental work that she needs to do, but she can't do anything until my doctor gives it a medical clearance, so they sent it to my primary care. But she wants the orthopedic doctor to sign off on it. So when I went last week, they were like we haven't got anything she's I can't really do much for you, she just kind of put a cap on it and it helps it does it doesn't hurt as much but. Actually. Yesterday I got up and. call the doctor got a fact for them, I gotta call the dentist back today cuz I did leave them a message for them, the facts, the paperwork over. yeah that was on Saturday, and then, what is this the 17th.
