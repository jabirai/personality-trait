5842.0,Patient,"Money my life, right now, but I had a question um I started a job Monday and then I was trying to make up a group and Isaiah had already left for his family emergency so kind of birth things off. That was an emotional wreck but I had them I missed my job on Tuesday, because I was withdrawing I was so sick, because I was my. It was my sick and day and someone told me there yesterday that I could contact someplace and they would give me a doctor's note, would you know, like which part of the company, I could ask for doctors know."
706.0,Provider,I did you took when you were in the vc and you did you're checking did you ask them at all.
5842.0,Patient,"No. I. know. I was worried about being late for this appointment chips I there's a guy and then it was distorted a little bit when it sound like a robot when he was talking to me, so I was, I was chatting saying my birthday, is this day, my name is this. And I really need to get into this. With my counselor but he just kicked me out like five times, no, it was like oh my God, I mean good. But um."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. What you want to do. Is when we're done here you'll want to talk to the vc don't want to explain to them that. You didn't get your medication and that you got sick. And the basically there's a doctors that are covering for Isaiah so there'll be able to get you here medication. Okay, but um and those would also be the doctors, that would be able to write kind of an excuse, saying that you were not able to make it to work if they think that it's valid."
5842.0,Patient,ducks are so within the group yesterday that I ended up being in.
706.0,Provider,yeah Dr South yeah so um what time did what did you do yesterday.
5842.0,Patient,than noon. My time Eastern.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so that would have been 12 o'clock your time Eastern time would have been 11 o'clock my time so that I don't do that group. So that's why okay so. I do, which in it doesn't matter. scripts. What was that i'm sorry."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay, I was gonna say. I Mondays are better oh I. I wasn't Thursday groups, for a long time, like 12 months, and I think or 11 months in the last three months. They switched me over to Monday. But in my chart it kept saying Wednesday so. they're saying you've been you've been absent for two months and i'm like no no somebody. Please, but i'm i'm helping that some, but the guy His name was mark. He said that he was going to send me all the surveys and and video, and I did all those things, so I should be in compliance and if i'm still not I need to find out why it needs to be fixed because they didn't ask for all that. I cry. Like five hours to listen in a breakout room on Tuesday and forgot about me. And then, they said Oh, if you can get you know to a wi fi was in the next few minutes. I told the therapist dying, he said, honey, if you don't get to a group you're not getting your medicine and I said, I have to go to work and asleep promise me, but then I found out two hours after that. The reason that they didn't let me in the group was because it was a Michigan group and the doctor kitten right medicine for me. So sorry. To talk to."
706.0,Provider,him but.
5842.0,Patient,"I did get I got I got one of my medicines, which is the suboxone but she forgot to send my gabapentin so I told kroger when I picked up this box and I asked what they send the you know the reach out to the doctor, but I don't know if it will go to the right place and size is not there."
706.0,Provider,"yeah I say a Scott as as as going to be out the rest of the month, at least. So, Dr style is one of the people, that is, covering for him so she would probably be the one."
5842.0,Patient,Because she's working.
706.0,Provider,"With that Eastern time zone group, are you in Ohio."
5842.0,Patient,yep yeah i'm in.
706.0,Provider,yep she's covering for the Ohio groups. So to kind of solved the group issue what day and time for group works for you.
5842.0,Patient,"Well i'm the Monday at 10 works for me really well but i'm that. Guy said that he put me in for Mondays at noon, so I need to what I need to find out is if that's just for this coming Monday, or if that's forever, so I don't. mess anything up you know what I mean. Just I just started that job and on Wednesdays I watched my grandson can we go to children's for occupational therapy, so I wednesday's are usually really busy i'm like later in the evening."
706.0,Provider,The Monday 12 Eastern group is my group.
5842.0,Patient,"Oh, it is OK, well, that would be good than."
706.0,Provider,"It is with Isaiah. Okay, we have that group it's 11 o'clock my time 12 o'clock your time. And like I said he's going to be out for the next several weeks, but stacked or sal is covering that group."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay, is he okay. Dr Cruz okay."
706.0,Provider,I don't know I don't know any details I just know he's on a family emergency.
5842.0,Patient,"Oh yeah that's what I sent him an email explaining about my job, like. I was personally proud of myself and then I ptsd So when I got this I got a thing right back immediately that says i'm out of the office family emergency and I was like Oh, my goodness, am I going to get my medicine. But um. I just. I don't want to mess up my my job when I. just got you know I mean. I. had the courage to work at a time and just got it and i'm. If I will consider like. be a manager. that's another thing. I need. A wonder so. I don't have to have it every day if they don't want me on it every day or. Whatever to. take these management placements because, like I have running thoughts i'm very nervous, you know. i'm full of too much energy, like, I guess, I talked too much, but I don't have anybody to talk to besides it's popular. But as far as my recovery, I have never been clean this long and I really do like your program and everybody there is really nice I just I wish the other day that things are new. i've been there 15 months. Okay, but before that I, I was at another place called pinnacle and I really liked it but they didn't have a counselor so they had to shut down because. Or else he didn't have a doctor one or the other, they were missing a vital link in the surface and I nobody knew none of that you know, none of us. know. To. The doctor. But you know just Doc thing was going wrong or what have you and she would text me right back, but um you know she would say I get at least 30 texts, a day and it's a lot, you know, so I didn't want to bug her, but I, as a as a little bit different he says that. She we're not supposed to I guess email him unless it's really important because he doesn't like to be bothered so I guess i'm a little bit intimidated by him but also you know changes kind of uncomfortable against that's it too so i'm just trying to work through that."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah they're very different I think in I think all of the the medical providers are very different, and the way that and the way that they do things. Is it the same way, I think it's an individual style and individual preference. If we had all of our patients emailing us. Even once a day we'd have you know 100 emails so that's The reason for that, because some people will email about every little thing. And so it kind of sounds hard I don't don't email unless it's an emergency, but basically it's like hey i'll See you in group once a week I don't want you to not come to group and then. email me, whatever your issue is, if you have an issue you need to be in growth, because then it can be addressed."
5842.0,Patient,"Go to oh that makes sense yeah well, I thought, maybe he was really overwhelmed or something, but what you're saying makes sense. yeah yeah that's a watch as well."
706.0,Provider,"yeah we just have so many patients, and then we have the groups, plus we do you know individual so he does individual medical appointments, just like I do the individual therapy appointments. You know, and when you have."
5842.0,Patient,As many patients as we.
706.0,Provider,Have it just.
5842.0,Patient,It just.
706.0,Provider,"It all adds up. And so to make time we will in an emergency, but if you're just not showing up to group and then being like Okay, I mean this or hey this isn't right, then what he's saying is you know that's not an emergency, you need to be in group unless it wasn't emergency that you weren't in group."
5842.0,Patient,You know right.
706.0,Provider,"don't have multiple emergencies typically in a month all on the same day, at the same time. Exactly no that's."
5842.0,Patient,What the line yeah.
706.0,Provider,"that's a compliance issue so anyways um no i'm glad you were able to make it today, and I think that. What you'll want to do was be come to group and talk to Dr sal."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay, I was gonna ask that because I don't think she has any one on ones, when I asked yesterday I don't think there were any available."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah so that's what we want to do is come to grips active actor so. When we're done here go back to the. vc tell them. ask them what group they put you in and tell them you want to be in the Monday group. That Monday Ohio group. that's the 12 o'clock group and, hopefully, they can get you on."
5842.0,Patient,That schedule. So you can see.
706.0,Provider,"So you can see, Dr sal."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay Okay, thank you."
706.0,Provider,"And then she'll be able to help you, with your. medication. And she'll be able to get you. scheduled with an opening with."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay okay well that'll work that'll work, then yes, she seemed very nice I actually was in a group with Dr so I want to say, the day after Labor day. Because. As. Well, maybe you didn't work either, but um they didn't work on tonight it know until it is not working, today, and it was like oh no. yeah but, in the past."
706.0,Provider,"Now, if we didn't work on Labor day we had announced that. A couple weeks prior and then I think we did reminders every week. Up to. up into the holiday so."
5842.0,Patient,"yeah we just we just didn't have group that day. yeah what. time when I know a holidays coming i'm just going to ask, like, I guess, be in. Sorry. Can you hear me Oh, I was gonna say i'm. Basically I I felt like I got dropped off the ball on but I didn't know. You were too busy to. It. Just says here your navigator."
706.0,Provider,yeah you're cutting in and out really. Just re.
5842.0,Patient,schedule so.
706.0,Provider,You.
5842.0,Patient,"closer to the building, it seems like. Cars go by."
706.0,Provider,yeah interesting you want it and I bought an appointment for another one on one therapy.
5842.0,Patient,"yeah for my compliance, I need to make another appointment, whether it's this month next month we just they're blaming me for it, so I just didn't know if I need to or could go directly for you or if I needed to go through BC."
706.0,Provider,"You would want to go through vc because then they're going to mark that for the compliance. The one thing they. tell you is I also do a Friday care group at 9am my time, so it would be. 10am your time. Okay it's."
5842.0,Patient,"In what I just checked in like I did today, or is there a special zoom number, I need."
706.0,Provider,"there's a special zoom number that you'll need so you'll need to go into the vc and you'll need to ask them to be put on for friday's group. friday's grip, is what we call the Friday care group it's. There for people that need extra extra support, as well as people that need to make up."
5842.0,Patient,group session okay. And do that okay.
706.0,Provider,"You know, since you've been missing group that might."
5842.0,Patient,yeah well that's the thing I i'm a bi weekly per person hold on.
706.0,Provider,tell you. So when we're done with our. Appointment here. I would just go back to the DC and.
5842.0,Patient,"I was just gonna say um I don't know if okay. Well, I just wanted to see if. You can see if it shows the algorithm is I guess compliant because i'm i'm a bi weekly person, but I wanted to go to your Friday groups, just because you know what I mean. That way, if they say that I need an extra group or even if they don't i'll have it there. But I don't want them to get it too. Because it seems like there's a lot of bad communication there, I guess, like I especially when you make up a group or you make up a date it always comes back to me when I thought that. If I made it up, then I was compliant but they like yesterday I had three people say oh you've been missing your class for since June and i'm like I would have never got my medicine, if I was missing since June. But they had me on a Wednesday. sitting on the Wednesday person and I haven't ever been a Wednesday person, so I hope that's fixed."
706.0,Provider,But um.
5842.0,Patient,"I hate to be so negative, the first time we meet them sorry."
706.0,Provider,Oh no you're fine go ahead.
5842.0,Patient,"Well, no that's just that's mainly it I just i've been doing everything that I know of to be compliant. But. The. surgery I guess. Because of our time frames, they were making your appointments. You weren't you. Were. Like they were making it, for me it was six or seven in the morning, so I thought that you're in California perfect. They."
706.0,Provider,"know they make the appointments typically and in our system they make the appointments Pacific time zone, which is three hours. behind. You so so it's five, so the appointment today was 545 Pacific time. It will yeah. And then, if."
5842.0,Patient,It was 545 Pacific time.
706.0,Provider,745 central time which is my time zone.
5842.0,Patient,And then.
706.0,Provider,The five your time zone.
5842.0,Patient,Oh i'm so sorry that got you up earlier than you were.
706.0,Provider,"Oh no, no, no, no, oh no that's not that's not an issue i'm not the Pacific time zones at 545. My time zone. Central time at 745."
5842.0,Patient,that's fine right right.
706.0,Provider,"yeah there's no issues with that, but that's just how the system works, because it's based out of California, so they do everything in Pacific time and on our schedule and then. And then I just know it's two hours later. or my time zone."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay, and then did they. Do they schedule our appointment for an hour a half hour, because when I was seeing phyllis they were scheduling me for 230 minute appointments. But I don't know if that's just how she did it or. that's a great heart health thing."
706.0,Provider,know if you were scheduled today for 30 minutes.
5842.0,Patient,"Or, however, taking too much time up i'm sorry."
706.0,Provider,"No you're fine. So I have to, I have to get off at 830, though, I do have another appointment, but I am i'm glad we did get to talk and like I said the vc is going to be the one that gets you back into compliance."
5842.0,Patient,The vcs.
706.0,Provider,"You exactly how to do it also on during Monday groups, we have a care navigator in our group. And you can talk directly with that care navigator. And figure out what's going on."
5842.0,Patient,OK OK okay.
706.0,Provider,So they're always in a. Group and people send them chats and then they send them chats back.
5842.0,Patient,You know just.
706.0,Provider,"No direct cats personal chats and and just try and figure it out, they can help you. make a bill payment, they can help you with compliance, they can help you with anything that you know is out of the realm of therapy where medication."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay okay well Thank you so much for inviting me to the Friday group to so you'll probably see me there as long as I it if it's raining real bad sometimes it takes me a little excited to walk like three miles to the windy city. But sometimes I have a friend that works over there and they give me a ride so just if it's raining here really terribly then. I might be a little, can you come in there, like five after 10 or yeah usually I try to go early."
706.0,Provider,So I I personally have a 15 minute window so. If you're there by 1015 I let you in if you're there after 1015 I don't. And I and that's simply because. You know I want everybody to kind of be held to the same kind of standard.
5842.0,Patient,"Right right yeah and I know in college, the first thing they taught us was if you're on time you're late."
706.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah so. You know I have that role for my groups, because you know, in all the groups but Friday group there's factor there's an actor with me. And they do their check in you know at the beginning of group and we usually start group, you know around five after we usually give people about five minutes to come in. So i'm about five after so by 15 after we're probably going to be done with that medical check in and so it's important that. If you're coming to group and you need to you know talk to the doctor that you're there before corner, after so you can have that conversation with the doctor, but your medication."
5842.0,Patient,So does the doctor change. Right Friday or.
706.0,Provider,No so.
5842.0,Patient,The will be just i'm asking this.
706.0,Provider,There is no doctor and Friday group.
5842.0,Patient,Group on Friday is just.
706.0,Provider,For extra therapy it's okay.
5842.0,Patient,Okay got be.
706.0,Provider,There is no doctor and Fridays group it's a care group.
5842.0,Patient,"Okay Okay, but you're talking about like your regular group, like Monday that's when the medical check. guys okay yeah okay got."
706.0,Provider,"Any sake, on Monday. The Monday at 12pm group that would be the first. The first thing that we do is kind of that medical check in. With doctors. likes to do, towards the end it kind of depends on. How many people, we have in grew up and how group is calling."
5842.0,Patient,"Okay okay yeah i've gone through different situations where they're either real quiet, or they talk too much and it takes way too long to get through checks, I understand okay so it's 927 um. Well, I guess, maybe i'll try vc and if they say that your book or something and I might check with you at the group and write you a chat they say that you're okay well, thank you very much."
706.0,Provider,you're welcome have.
5842.0,Patient,A great day.
706.0,Provider,You take care.
5842.0,Patient,Thank you you're welcome.
