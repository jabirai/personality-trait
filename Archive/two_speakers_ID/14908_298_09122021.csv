So it's just like a lot but, and it was triggering for me because i've been having like eating disorders on and off and my parents don't know so it was just like, for me it was just difficult and I started like. drinking a lot and like like eating edibles a lot like I was always like under the influence or something like on a depressant and. I started taking benadryl because I was just like wasn't getting any sleep, so I was at school and I felt like I felt like I was gonna like I just felt really metal like. physically and mentally bad, so I was afraid I was gonna make a really bad decision, so I decided to check myself in."

Unlike tired, but also like very anxious like we had auditions the other day, and I was just like non stop like shaking and like I thought it was going to have like a heart attack because of my heart, I was just like oh my gosh. So i'm like I think i'm just like at this like exhausted and just kind of like anytime that I can be in my room, I will be i'm just because i'm like kind of very like overstimulated I guess."
298.0,Provider,What would you like me to know about you.
14908.0,Patient,"Good question. I don't know, I think that um. I. Like to take a lot of things on just so I can be distracted but live and so it's it's only until recently, where I realized it's probably not the best idea. So I just I i'm not the best with like many people taking care of myself, so this is like kind of new for me so that's just kind of that's probably the best thing but i'm willing to pretty much do anything so I don't feel so bad all the time, pretty much."
298.0,Provider,"Would you like referrals for a psychiatrist in the therapist or would you like to join our mental health program and what our program is is, you see a therapist every other week on zoom. And, and you go to group therapy one hour once a week for the first month and then after one month, you can ask to go down to twice a month. But that's a decision that's made you know with you on a treatment team and then anytime that you want to meet with me for medication, you are welcome to do that. So you have I can send you referrals within your insurance, that you can go to or you can join our program do you have any thoughts."
14908.0,Patient,um I think i'm probably leaning towards referrals.
298.0,Provider,Okay happy to get that for you um So what is your living situation.
14908.0,Patient,"yeah so I live in i'm sharing a house with like. five other acting students so and like I purposely chose a bedroom that's on the first floor so I kind of have like my own, space um but yeah we're all we're all students."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and what are your stressors in life."
14908.0,Patient,"i'm probably money, the biggest one. Money family. And, and then school I just think it's cool to just trying to like do well."
298.0,Provider,Okay. um. Do you have any pending legal issues.
14908.0,Patient,"legal issues um I mean the only thing I can think of was, I was in a car accident like a month ago, so i'm getting some like physical reimbursement for that, but that's pretty much it."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Are you feeling suicidal right now."
14908.0,Patient,"Right now, no not."
298.0,Provider,When was the last time you had thoughts.
14908.0,Patient,um when I was admitted. So that was probably the. I think the 29th of the 30th of October October August.
298.0,Provider,Okay. How would you describe your moods.
14908.0,Patient,"My moods they are pretty much stagnant I don't really like when I do get energy I do get an injury is usually, when i'm stimulated like my my friends, but i'm pretty much just kind of always. Just kind of mellow I think I don't have a lot of energy and um yeah I don't really it takes me it takes me like a bit to get motivated and kind of get high energy so yeah."
298.0,Provider,Do you have any questions about your medication.
14908.0,Patient,"I do so, I and taking so I was prescribed abilify to take at night, like two milligrams like the smallest dosage and night, and they kept me on Prozac. 40 milligrams but my issue was like I felt like it's not really helping as much as maybe it should, I know I should probably also go to therapy to in conjunction with that so that's part of it, but um. But they just kept me on, and I was kind of at a point where I was like I just want to get out of here because, like I don't want to be here anymore. So I was like sure just keep me on the Prozac but i'm curious to see if there's any other antidepressants that might work or maybe something in like conjunction with it, or maybe it's just I need to go to therapy know probably work better so."
298.0,Provider,"So a couple of things. You need a psychiatrist to go over your meds and be if you make a dosage change, you need to do that when you know that you can get back in with them and so. don't change your medicine unless it's causing really bad side effects, but still contact someone to get to monitor you when you make a dosage change. I love that you are on abilify two milligrams that is for that breaks treatment resistant depression. And so that's what's really nice about abilify at that little tiny dose and you combine it with Prozac which helps with moons the thing about Prozac is it's. somewhere between 20 and 60 milligrams is where somebody gets relief and it's one of those minutes, you have to take for like four weeks before you even notice that it's fixing things. The problem is the side effects if you don't like the side effects. Of the medicine it's hard to keep people that take the medicine if they don't like the side effects. yeah. Are you having side effects."
14908.0,Patient,"i'm honestly, not even really aware of side effects, so that is so big honestly yeah I think i'm straight by being with side effects."
298.0,Provider,Okay. um who is your support system.
14908.0,Patient,"um so I have like to I mean, I have a lot of friends here at school, which is good but i'd like to really close friends. And then my little sister. I can't really talk to her now because she's also taken care of herself and she's she's now admitted at an eating disorder facility. So she's getting her health dishing needs but pretty much my little sister and, like my close out my to close friends in California and my best friend."
298.0,Provider,Okay. Any okay any other mental health meds you've been on in the past. No.
14908.0,Patient,Just the Prozac and abilify okay.
298.0,Provider,"Do you know your height and weight, I do. Okay, what is it."

14908.0,Patient,"And they didn't want to deal with me. And that's that and then I would say, finding my identical twin sister when we were 18. That was, like the most recent like traumatic. thing I think yeah."
