165.0,Provider,hey.
2538.0,Patient,hi.
165.0,Provider,"hey I just figured I would since I have it i've been having difficulty getting a hold of the pharmacist just. Like a directly I figured we could do a I could take a look at your pill bottle with you, and so I could get a little bit more information before. Before I talk to her, because this might come down to I sent you a message really late last night and it said on my end that it didn't get sent but they're just so you know where we're at it's basically a he said she said scenario just. A heads up and and the. The end all be all may or may not end up being you know, having the pharmacy literally review their security tapes to about when you picked up your medication, because they reported it incorrectly or maybe not I don't know. You know i'm i'm my hands are just getting put into this, as we speak. And so I don't know what I don't know yet, but what I do know is that we can get some accurate information from your pill bottle I think that my computer resolution might be a little bit better than mj we don't know. But I couldn't see really the bottle and the images that she took, and so I do want to take a look at the bottle you have, I understand that there's a refill listed on the bottle itself is that your understanding. Okay, so um. Okay, so let me just start here, how can I have you state your first and last name, date of birth, for me, for the recording."
2538.0,Patient,Just Adams three anyone okay.
165.0,Provider,"All right, and you still have the pill bottle with you there JESSICA. yep Okay, I would hope so. And then. i'm happy Friday and then. Do you have that near you I feel like I can hear you holding it or something. Okay, so let me, let me ask you this. Because the images are hard to see and we'll go we'll get some images in a minute, what is the date that the the prescription list is like the refill date or the dispense date if there's two dates i'd like to take both of them, and if you could just tell me what those."
2538.0,Patient,"Because it was filled on 11 1621 correct. Okay, and how many."
165.0,Provider,How many were dispensed how many that have.
2538.0,Patient,"30 of 60 tablets, and then it says refill one by five slash. Okay, I when I talked to Courtney the night that i'm Dr so caught in the 60 she says, you still have a refill remaining from last month of 30 I said Oh well, then maybe that's why she only caught in the 60."
165.0,Provider,"Days so let's let's slow down here, because this is this is super important I like where you're going. It says number 30 of 60. yep okay i'm going to look at the I want to look at the report as well, oh my gosh I don't want it."
2538.0,Patient,"and Dr Sally even seen last night, where it said that there was one refill remaining. On the right woman, it was filled."
165.0,Provider,"Right and I, and so I want to look at that too i'm just kind of i'm. I trust both mj and I trust both Dr sell like I trust my own self you know what I mean. like, if I were to die and leave that my whole patient. caseload i'd be like they're in good hands, but I just need to do all of my little like nitty gritty stuff from the beginning, so, then that way, I have a full grasp because i'm if I have to go to bat for you i'm gonna go to bat for you. And if I go to bat for somebody i'm going to win if it's legitimate either way you know what I mean so so I just want to make sure we leave no stone unturned so we can get this handled appropriately. And and legitimately you know what I mean so so I see the one on 1116 so it says that you picked up okay so there's two listings and you might already have and i'm kind of talking to myself kind of talking to you, but there's two dispensed on. On the on the reporting, it looks like they there's a dispense quantity of number 66 zero and a number 30 number three zero now. Is that in your mind correct did you get 90 tablets on the 16th of November or did you only receive the number 30 out of 60 that you're talking about and holding right now."
2538.0,Patient,"I only got 60 tablets, and if I take three a day, why would my insurance company say that they would cover on the 12 you see what i'm saying."
165.0,Provider,"On the 12th of December. yeah Okay, so this is new information that I haven't had yet so so who told you that the insurance would have told you that you could fill on the 12th."
2538.0,Patient,Care source in a CVs.
165.0,Provider,Because it was that when was that Courtney that told you that as well.
2538.0,Patient,yeah and that would put it correctly me being shorted on till last month.
165.0,Provider,"So um I want, if I want to do our best to and so usually, when you take a picture it's the easiest to see if you have the fate of the cat the light facing whatever the images, so I want you to turn in whatever order. turn your camera around, so we can use the rear facing camera and then and then. I want to you what."
2538.0,Patient,So let me face it towards Islam or.
165.0,Provider,Right exactly yep totally. you're you're smart lady.
2538.0,Patient,there's last night I don't know I because I keep them put up so like. Some of the stuff rubs off about you know what amy.
165.0,Provider,"Right and that's what I that's what I initially said I said em gee I can't because, on her that she goes, I can tell clearly it says one refill and i'm like well from my view it when I."
2538.0,Patient,tried to send you pictures last night.
165.0,Provider,"How about in the bathroom can you go into the bathroom maybe. yeah Okay, sometimes bathroom lights are a little bit more effective."
2538.0,Patient,"And originally supposed to be leaving on the 11th but we're leaving out of me it's filled tonight at midnight and i'm like great what am I gonna do because. You know, and I never picked up the 18 pills, I never picked them up."
165.0,Provider,Just what. What is the what is the 18th we're so you have to talk to me like I hadn't.
2538.0,Patient,"worked me um. OK so i'm going to back up a little bit the night that I had called it, to see a doctor so had. Fixed you know the script or caught into said it was okay for me to to fill it early. So I would have enough."
165.0,Provider,Early refill from. November is that what you're talking about is. Are we going.
2538.0,Patient,"i'm talking about just a couple days ago okay on the seven factor so had originally called me and my months worth and that's when I called CVs and they said that my insurance wouldn't cover it will talk. And i'm like they said, if I wanted an early fill that I would have to call the doctor the doctor and have them call in to get it, because the insurance won't cover it till 12. For the following day I call she says well they called in 60 she was like but you got a remaining here from last month that was never picked up, so I called the repo number of the bottle that night and it says, you have one repo remaining."
165.0,Provider,What do you know what day this occurred.
2538.0,Patient,It was the day before yesterday.
165.0,Provider,"Okay, so uh the eighth Wednesday the eighth."
2538.0,Patient,"yep and then, when I call back last night, to see if the refill still remaining it says it says when I caught on Wednesday, the eighth it says, you have one refill remaining quantity of 30. available for pickup until are available repo until five. When I called last night, it says there is no refill available or this rx number. So what that means to me that they probably cancelled it out to cover their own Apps excuse my language."
165.0,Provider,"I heard that word before. um okay so. So okay so let's just. So yeah and the lighting is awesome so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make my screen a little bit bigger here oh yeah I think that I think that it might just be. I think Andrew is gonna be mad at me if someone told her, she needs a new computer and I think I might be right. Because I can I mean it's not it's not like you know perfect, but can you so leave the model where it is, but if you could just like the whole camera shifted down just about an inch or so and then. If you can touch the screen to see if any of that will clear up, but I think what it what's happening is it's just really rubbed off. Oh, see I was able to see that picture that time okay."
2538.0,Patient,Sorry.
165.0,Provider,"No, no you're fine you're fine I was wondering, I was like okay she's. Okay um can I can I see that, like the bottom third section where it's like kind of Gray. It looks like it has Dr cells name on it and then maybe back up just about an inch or two, but I want to see that bottom section there. And then, if you touch the screen, sometimes it will focus. And I know it's not going to be perfect, but."
2538.0,Patient,that's about it.
165.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and I and it's and it's awesome if I could have you rotate the bottle to where you know about a third of the way to your left there you go perfect. Okay, and then, if we get it one more time. keep going keep going i'll tell you when to stop."
2538.0,Patient,Really.
165.0,Provider,"Look here okay. All right, keep going keep going keep going alright, it looks like that's kind of all we really got there Okay, so let me."
2538.0,Patient,"know after after this i'm either in Jay said I would probably have to use CDs, you know for the early bill, but after this is done was CVs like."
165.0,Provider,I don't blame you I mean especially.
2538.0,Patient,"They have given so many. People so many problems here lately and i'm not the only one, like, I mean like i've heard other people like their short people, so they have new people in there all the time. Like they don't keep one pharmacist like there's been pharmacist in there when I went to go pick up my son's medication and. they're like well. i'm. don't know she talked about we don't have any prescriptions here for there were some that were sent and i'm like hold on a minute. You know it's a with my sister, I mean Maybe my sister's on on regular suboxone and she went in there and they got real shitty with her and told her that she was going to even though that her bill date was. You know, do for that day and her doctor called event, they told her that it would be ready until tomorrow morning, and she was just gonna have to tough it out and come back like my uncle was there, the night that Courtney told me that I have a repo remaining. Of 30 realized what my uncle was there, my."
165.0,Provider,"model says. Okay, so here's the deal JESSICA, the one thing that i'm hanging my hat on right now in this moment is that a quantity doesn't ever say. 3560 unless there's some left there now it's different than being a refill and here's how it's. Remaining quantity hey I have a staff member just waiting in my waiting room I think mj can you hear me oh she's not even connected to audio, let me just admit them in so that he knows that I can't help him or whatever i'm just going to pause our recording. sounds good good okay so i'm going to try to call the fire i'm going to try to call again and get Ahold of Courtney again now okay i'm just going to disconnect from audio call over to the pharmacy and see. Sometimes. You know and i'll just leave I mean I don't know I guess there's not a whole lot of information that I can give you yet, but I will. i'm usually pretty good at stuff so let's see if we can't pull it Danielle. Which is like a miracle that's a good thing we'll see if we can pull it in yo."
2538.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, why would the bottles hey there's a repo and that that second you know."
165.0,Provider,"Well yeah I mean. I mean, so when you go in there, let me ask you this, how do you when you when you get the medication some pharmacies, have you like sign for it some pharmacies just you know."
2538.0,Patient,Nice I don't have any sign for nothing.
165.0,Provider,They okay just.
2538.0,Patient,"pull out a piece of paper, and then they end up throwing it away 90% of the time."
165.0,Provider,"Okay, because I have to initial something when I get my prescriptions. But I mean so and then like I was going to tell you this earlier, so I just want you to be aware that this I mean this is what I told Dr cell if it comes down to it, I think, actually, maybe I already mentioned this to you, it might come down to the security tapes. You know and and see and having them review like because it looks like they dispense the whole prescription to you on that day, but if that's the error, then there's a deficit of. You know 30 tablets that you didn't receive and that's in your mind the deficit, that is. And kind of everybody's mind, because the 12th the 12th is only two days from now, though."
2538.0,Patient,Right that's what i'm saying why is my insurance company going to take care for doesn't cover anything early maybe one day early.
165.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah I agree. Okay.
2538.0,Patient,"So, why would they tell me that. Here, why was CVs in here first tell me that it's old will pick up on the that the it'll cover it on the 11th or 12th. which would be six or seven days early as opposed to."
165.0,Provider,The I know you did have a dose change kind of recently to right like you stopped to. National to milligram tab like your dose ain't do.
2538.0,Patient,i'm not on the treadmill a room somewhere i'm only on the age.
165.0,Provider,"Right, but was your dose a little bit higher when you were taking the twos or is it wasn't like weren't you taken a two milligrams in addition to the eight milligrams or."
2538.0,Patient,I haven't been on those on the two milligrams since October.
165.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's not a super recent thing then okay all right fair enough, and this is the lexington avenue CBS right. Just for compassion okay. i'm going to go ahead and disconnect from audio and call the pharmacy you just take a deep breath drink some water whatever you got to do do your packing or something and and i'm going to see what I can't do it might take me a few minutes I guess is what i'm trying to let you know. Okay that's. All right, thank you. hey JESSICA, just so you know I did Courtney didn't answer the call she has three shots to give I told her, she has all my patients i'm going to chill out on hold with her. i'm going to pause our recording and and and put you into a breakout room, just so that sal can get whatever he needs addressed."
2538.0,Patient,"on her way over she was there, the night that I talked to Courtney, and I had it on speaker phone. And just to let you know."
165.0,Provider,So okay.
2538.0,Patient,"You know, because i'm like I said normally I account my meds my leave the pharmacy but last month, I did it because we were you know, in a hurry to leave for thanksgiving. Because normally they give me the punch out bottles, which is normally weird to you know what I mean. Because there's 30 in each bottle normally they give me three of those bottles. And they didn't give me those last month. And I. And I was like huh this looks weird I said but Oh well, you, am I, and I raise I just come on let's go, we don't have time, you know to for around, and so I never ended up counting them. And you know so now, here it is i've got two pills loved and 18 at the pharmacy that's not going to give me through you know January near at all."
165.0,Provider,yeah well i'm gonna go ahead and i'm going to pause the recording put you into a waiting room or the breakout room and then i'll bring you back in as soon as I have something for you okay.
2538.0,Patient,Okay.
165.0,Provider,"alrighty Thank you. hey. So it is 145 where you are at right now right. yeah okay so she is supposed to be done at 2pm today, but she is going to review security footage at 2pm i'm gonna call her at 215 she's gonna stay late to review the security footage if I were you if it were me. I might be there around 205 and make sure that the security footage because you're you're going to you're going to be your best advocate I just went to bat for you, because here here's why. she believes that she gave you two pill bottles on the 16th she believes that she gave you and and so and that's her standpoint and I can't defend or whatever I said it's going to come down to looking at that security footage because. i've had one pill bottle presented to me JESSICA i'm going to ask you one time because i've i've already went to bat for you just so you know. i've already couldn't how to present. Did you receive more than one pill bottle on the 16th of November."
2538.0,Patient,"yeah I did, but as you see it says 3060."
165.0,Provider,They gave you two pill bottles of buprenorphine on the 16th of.
2538.0,Patient,"November each bottle there wasn't 60 in 30 it was 30 and 30 and my sister is on her way over here she says she'll be here like seven minutes ago she said she'd be here in 10 minutes. She was here the night that I talked to Courtney, and she said that I had remainder remaining from last month. I had it on speakerphone."
165.0,Provider,"If, but if you received on the 1630 and 30 you should still have another."
2538.0,Patient,"30 and then, when I call. me from the 16th of last month. Right and then, when I called that night after the close it said, you still have a remainder of 30. Of what I did the reef phone number is and you still have one remaining refill a 30 the buprenorphine for. available for pickup it till 515 2022 now, this was on Wednesday, yes, last night, when I called yesterday, it says this Rico is no longer available for pickup which be somebody cancelled it out of the system."
165.0,Provider,"Well, there was a prescription sent in by Dr sell on the eighth and then that was canceled on the ninth because that's when Dr cell and Courtney spoke."
2538.0,Patient,"So this was from the the word, where it says record mean even the bottle that I showed you Okay, when I type the numbers at on Wednesday or or yeah Wednesday when I talked to Courtney after they closed. It says, you have one remaining refill would you like to go as a hit submit refill I just hung up because I didn't want to mess anything up with the 16th she called in when I called back yesterday, it says this refill is no longer available. Are there is no longer a refill refill available for this prescription."
165.0,Provider,i'm. So. So so her checking the footage isn't going to help because you did receive two bottles on that day.
2538.0,Patient,"3030 and. I mean. What a pot, so let me ask you this, this is the other thing that she that she brought up and I didn't defend this or go I didn't say anything about it either way because I thought you would only receive one bottle I thought you would have told me if you had received more than one."
165.0,Provider,"So let me ask you this, is there a is there any way that someone in your immediate circle could have. taken some of the medication without your knowledge is there any way that you could have lost some of the medication."
2538.0,Patient,"I mean not lose it, I mean. they're they're there, I mean."
165.0,Provider,"Think and think about it, like Jenny genuinely because it's a matter of you know anything because that's. I actually i'm actually I need to call her back and tell her that she doesn't need to sit there. And filter through footage OK so i'm going to hang up and call her back or i'm not going to hang up i'm going to disconnect from audio color right back. let her know she doesn't need to look through security footage that's going to give her peace of mind. But what I want you to do genuinely while I talked to her is think about any chance that medication, you know, on holidays, and you know. Out of towns and families, and this, not the other, and I understand families aren't always perfect so just think about it, and it genuinely and objectively identify. If that is possible, is it will you do that for me. yeah Okay, thank you i'll be right back."
2538.0,Patient,"Wait. Closing yes yeah I did get two bottles of The thing is, is there is the one bottle says 30 of 60. Right. Never not once said that I didn't get to go balls I just decided this is 30 or 60 so I offered you know. They would you know see that this is 30 or 60 and that they were putting two different pill bottles because they don't really do 16 one bottle 30 or they use the 30 3030 the punch out tabs. And that's why like that's about to push out tasks, because I know how many pills are in that bottle and I said, there are uncountable number would. The House I stay with you this weekend I can't deal with the word."
165.0,Provider,"Okay, so. How did your how did your thought process go."
2538.0,Patient,"You know. I don't know honestly I mean yeah my son he he's you know real bad on on drugs, right now, but if. He needed anything he won't take my meds Do you know what I mean he would come to me, and you say mom i'm saying, can you please you know, do something he wouldn't take my take my meds. You amy."
165.0,Provider,"Well yeah yes, I know because i've been that child before. Right, honestly, you know I mean if i'm going to be completely transparent with you, there was a time of."
2538.0,Patient,"Being an artist, you know."
165.0,Provider,yeah no totally and that's so that's why i'm leveling with you. To like.
2538.0,Patient,"yeah I know this is the first time since i've started with bright hurts, as you guys have started anything like this has ever happened, you know with me. And, and I just I don't understand you know, because my sister was there and she's here now. Was there than I that I called and it said, you have one refill of quality of 30 available for pickup until 515 2022 and then last night or yesterday when we call back it said. This this prescription."
165.0,Provider,has no results remaining.
2538.0,Patient,"Work right has a refills relating. So you know I don't I really don't know all's I know is is we're supposed to be leaving a little bit and I don't I. I I won't go if I don't have my meds because I mean my cells aren't going this time because you made an ugly ass off the last time you know, and I just I hear you know if."
165.0,Provider,"So um so I have so when I call I went to call the pharmacy back and I wasn't able to reach them because it's their lunch hour. And so I sent a fax over to Courtney to get totally get a message to her to have her call me back right away. I just don't want her to waste your time and first I don't want to get more frustrated, on top of all of this, when I know already that she was just meant to do bottles, so I what I did do. Who I did talk to you was Dr cell that's who I called in like while I you know what I mean, while I was giving you a couple minutes to just kind of move things over. So I talked to Dr cell and and the only way that will be able to get you medication, which we don't want you to go without medication because that's like a. mean honestly that's like a Christmas break waiting to turn into tragedy right, so the one thing that we can do is, and I, but I want to talk to Courtney first is have the if if there's no magical way that medication shows up here we just have to make you fill out a police report. about the missing medication and and then that way we can get you medication until your do again does that make sense yeah. Right Okay, I appreciate your understanding on that so i'm going to in about two well right now the pharmacy phone line should be opening back up so in about one minute i'm going to call Courtney again. And and try to get her off the hook here, but then I also spent. So just in your mind just know that I think that that's probably where we're going to have to go we're probably going to do to do a police report. But we don't like our patients do without MED, so all we need is the police report and the pharmacies willingness to dispense but they won't do that also without the police report, so let me go ahead and a breeze. Are you breathing. I haven't been breathing I don't think. It is kind of necessary it's like partially it's like partially it's pretty important it kind of helps sometimes so. I really want to help, I hope that you can. I hope that you know that that's my intention here that i'm."
2538.0,Patient,"That i'm I know. Okay, but you know it's just like you I you know I said, you know it i've been with you guys, since you guys started and darker jamison you know, it was my original doctor."
165.0,Provider,that's a long time.
2538.0,Patient,"Nothing like this has ever happened with me nothing you know it's always better to either the doctor call you in the wrong dosage. Or you know, maybe like it, I under I understand you guys have a lot lot of Asians you guys deal with a lot, but you know it's like on my Defense like you know yeah they did dispense two bottles, but clearly it says, all the second model 30 of 60 where's the other 30 freakin pills."
165.0,Provider,"Well, there was another bottle and that's where we're that's what I mean and so and."
2538.0,Patient,"That was the second model that that was the second bottle it normally. Okay, I do keep my models for the month like after their emptied it is weird because when when you asked for the other Obama was I hadn't nobody Nice did so over there."
165.0,Provider,Okay um.
2538.0,Patient,"I would say, like."
165.0,Provider,"Oh, you mean and then that makes me angry. yeah and."
2538.0,Patient,"then take it, you know."
165.0,Provider,"well. And you're in your son does your son have like open access to your House like that, I mean do you guys live together. With."
2538.0,Patient,That or he lives right next door to me.
165.0,Provider,"Okay um I would I mean I, and I and i'm not trying to I would never blame somebody else's child for anything i'm just saying, maybe this maybe that is kind of the missing link here, maybe, maybe it's time to you know if you're certain that you're. I just it's hard to blame our own children for stuff and like to know that, like our children may or may not have done something so. I want you to and i'm saying this with as much respect and love in the world, I am going through some stuff with my kid right now, like like she was like poisonous like crazy stuff, but I have i'm looking at her really objectively right now so as as a parent to parent."
2538.0,Patient,Child probably to say he said that some guy from Columbus boys and leave and that's how he got it oh VI and you know as a parent I I called the courthouse because they were going to give them a reckless off and i'm like you cannot just let him walk away with a reckless operation.
165.0,Provider,Right.
2538.0,Patient,"Let him keep his license you about blow up a Shell gas station for Christ sakes, you would have woken up a 10 block radius where we live at, and you know. He can be he would have been sent in person, you know but i'm trying to you know, to go to bat for my child and protect my child and he thinks that i'm trying to make him go to jail and get clean no that's not what i'm trying to i'm trying to save his life, you know. Right, I will be there to help save you know me before you know I got to my mid 30s before I decided to get clean."
165.0,Provider,"Now let me ask you this, where do you store your medication i'm. A lockbox."
2538.0,Patient,"I have a I. recently got a it's like a medication pouch with a padlock on it. Okay, so."
165.0,Provider,Does anybody else have that code.
2538.0,Patient,No nobody's got the code to it.
165.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
2538.0,Patient,recently got back so you know I just recently got it like.
165.0,Provider,"Okay, so within this last Okay, because that's what we that's what we suggest usually is that that that kind of thing occur. Now, and then, if the whole thing goes missing the whole thing goes missing, you know but um but it takes away from that little. When I personally was when I was in my early 20s you know 10 plus years ago that I would, I would just it would just be one or two of my dad's by the time you know one or two. At a time, or maybe three maybe I get ballsy and take for whatever. right but. that's."
2538.0,Patient,"that's how be in my sister, and while they didn't do it to my brother Bailey just need a sister, they would do a spike in it, because he get it, the va.
