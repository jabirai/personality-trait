Like i'm in the shower and like people that live in that store mess, with the faucet so that the heat, you know why would someone want to. I you know, and maybe I don't you know it's it's been going on for a long time for a couple weeks so it's like every time I get in the shower it goes from you know the temperature fluctuates. And up until today, I was like older they're doing that too. I don't know. My landlord that when, let me what one second. Alright hit the phone rang and. i'm still having a lot of difficulty. With all my friends are who got he's recovering he was hit by far, but he told me that my landlords daughter said that to hurt me well guess what she did it is screwed with my head. Like I don't understand how why she would say that if she does it does she intend to evict me or I mean her mom is that's really screwed with me that she said that that hate hate bothers me people that hate. That try to hurt me bother me it's really bothered me I got my haircut Saturday. um I went in there, I showed her pictures all she did I I showed her pictures I said, I would like to layered up in the back of my head thrown out. She could have done something with my hair that had worn out on see did was took the comb and the buzzer around my head up here so long, I can put in a ponytail and around the site is."
