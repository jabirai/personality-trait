383.0,Provider,morning. How are you today.
11445.0,Patient,i've heard it's like a day on i'm just woke up so all right now i'm been overwhelmed recently so.
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm. glad you were able to make it despite just waking up. It seems like one of those mornings, people are having a hard time getting started i've had a couple of people just not show up that are regular you know regularly attend so."
11445.0,Patient,"No, no."
383.0,Provider,"yeah it's just one of those mornings, I think. But you made it so as you always do you're very punctual and timely. So, how was school going for you."
11445.0,Patient,"um well, the last two weeks rough bad I have an assignment do yesterday and I spent almost all day doing it, and I still did not finish it in time for it to be due at midnight, so I was working on it up until midnight. Because I had other things going on the last couple weeks and it just made me really busy, so I just haven't had a little time to do things that I need to do, and it makes it's just been overwhelming."
383.0,Provider,"So you've been doing it there's been other things going on, besides the. school and what do you want to talk about those that they've been other demands on your time or."
11445.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. Sorry. These I told you probably so these moms coming she's she's coming today. at around I think like five at night or something like that. So i've had to I just it's very stressful when she comes and not in a mean way. But you know there's a lot of stuff that has to be done when she comes so i've been trying to clean and just get stuff together i'm not even finish cleaning. So, and to finish that today, unfortunately. For as much as."
383.0,Provider,I was like that might care.
11445.0,Patient,"mine. Oh, and on top of all of that. The last like four days. I just had a hard time eating because about three days ago. About three days ago I. had an incident, I had a hair in my food, so you know that was the first instance, so I was like Okay, you know. I had to stop eating so, then I didn't ask you later it was rough but I did eat later, but then the next couple days after that. happened again where i'd found a hair, for some reason in my food, but just very unlikely I don't I feel like it's the fact that I found it three days in a row, is actually kind of astronomical which doesn't usually happen to me but."
383.0,Provider,"No, no. This food that you prepared at home or."
11445.0,Patient,at home.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, I just want to get clarification on that and."
11445.0,Patient,"I know. This was food at home. So I felt like once I could pull myself out of that headspace you know what I mean like I was like Okay, I can probably I just have to be extra careful I just felt like I got right back into it, because you know. It just felt like I just couldn't get out of this like Funk, of the food and like I have such a bad like. When she says, even if I feel, even if there's nothing wrong with it, and I feel like as if it's contaminated I won't I can't eat it. And then I have to have like kind of it's not a full panic attack, but it's like I can't convince myself to you know what I mean, which is really struggling thing. What is frustrating so that's been going on the last like four days. On top of everything else so."
383.0,Provider,Do you want to talk about that a little bit more in depth. Sure you're terminated food.
11445.0,Patient,"Oh yeah definitely stems from my health cold. The last well, I mean most of my life my house hasn't really been the Kremlin plan list, but the last couple years were exceptionally awful. and never talked about it but. My mother adopted they found animals. That were sick from our backyard, they were kept. My little sister did technically, but so they ended up keeping them. But so they always had like stomach issues, basically, what would make them go to the bathroom on the floor. But then, no one would clean it up and then, but it was like multiple places, you know what I mean so it's like but for some reason it didn't bother anybody else I don't know if it was just like they were ignoring it I don't know it got like really bad, though. The point where I wasn't even home very often because I worked in I know that was I went to school and work. I basically was gone the almost all the time to get out of the House I didn't want to be home. When I did come home at night, you know. It was stressful, for I think the last like two years I just when I did eat at home, I just had to like. And it was a survival thing, where I just like I hate when I was there, but once I got out any food that just felt contaminated or for you when I think about it too long, like. I can't like sitting in my own thoughts, because if I sing too long about what i'm doing with food, I have my brain will go back to that place of like a contaminated. By just have to kind of. try and do other things, while i'm eating which isn't good to do. But it's going away, I can eat sometimes when it's not always too bad the last few years have just been exceptionally bad due to the the hair by sound for the last three days."
383.0,Provider,"Right right right well, the first thing i'd like to reflect back to you is that. You. You know, being exposed in your family's home, you know the place where you are dependent and someone else's in charge, and that and that. And, and the place that you live that's supposed to be your safe place with the people that are supposed to be in charge have. The places filthy with animal feces and you know around and that that is not that is like. Such a that's a trauma that's not that is not a. Normal I mean I don't really like the word normal but it's a very unhealthy environment, and so I just really want to validate what you had to cope with growing up, and in those years, when you said that things were really bad. You know there's a reason that we don't. You know bathrooms use in some cultures and not even in the House, because they consider that you know excrement to be so, you know something that should not be near. In where human beings are where food is prepared, so your thoughts and feelings about how gross it was and what was is totally. Normal and your revulsion at eating and in an environment where there's poop around is completely valid. So I want to just. You know just impress you with that validation because it's not was not healthy, it was extremely unhealthy and your people that were in charge we're not taking responsibility of just basic health. You know protocols that should be in place in a home where you're taking care of children and young people. So I think that in stepping into a healthy. relationship with your food. is going to be for you, a step into recognizing that in your home in the place where you live, where you're the adult. You keep things clean and you don't have cats running around throwing up a notch now, you do have a cat and then I just do you feel like you do keep your your own home clean, or do you do feel a little bit like I don't, let me tell me a little bit about how you keep your own. home."
11445.0,Patient,"I would say our home our own home is definitely not it's not like nasty it's like it's. I would say it's like. cluttered but like not on the nasty way you know we have a lot of fun. um but you know i'm not i'm not perfect, I have obviously of depression, so I rarely put this with moving out though i've never since moving out had like dirty dishes in my room and things like that i'm pretty good about not eating upstairs. But I felt like you don't have any semblance."
383.0,Provider,Of what it was that you grew up with like you don't have picked up cat stuff.
11445.0,Patient,Around okay.
383.0,Provider,"So, so you are not in so that's one thing to remind yourself just just regularly like when you step into your House. You don't have an picked up cat feces or you know, an all of those things, and I know I have a cat and a dog and sometimes they have accidents and sometimes there's disgusting stuff around. And if it's 2am and I hear my cat is throwing up I wake up turn the lights on clean it all up and I don't leave stuff lying around on the ground. If I can possibly help it I don't care what time of day or night, it is. But just that to say there's so there's these these different ways of. Keeping your House clean different standards. And you're telling me that when you step into your own home it's vastly different than what you grew up and."
11445.0,Patient,Now.
383.0,Provider,"i'm in. So that's something you want to remind yourself, so you can start to feel safe. And, like the your home is that, where you live now is a sanitary place. doesn't mean the 409 everything like 24 seven at all just you you you keep it relatively clean. And that's your current reality. So that's what you want to remind yourself that your current reality is. That you. You know what you are experiencing today is a cleanliness in your home."
11445.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,"So that when you take a piece of when you when you. When you start to eat something and then also you want to you know you want to remind yourself that as you're eating this food right now whether it's an apple a shake a prepared meal, that it has been prepared, and it is you are eating it in your home where your standards of cleanliness. exist and you're no longer in under you know in that past environment that was. Really completely. traumatizing. And and unsanitary and unhealthy and should not. I mean that's not a way to live, but people live in all kinds of ways. i'm and I know that I have, I have an aunt to us like a cat lady and she's up. Some really interesting individual and at the same time she has had a mental illness, for many, many years and her house was completely unlivable by most other people's standards but. terms of you know cat and. horrible yucky stuff and smelling terrible you know. kind of thing so. I don't know if that helps you to feel any those suggestions or how, what do you think about what I just had."
11445.0,Patient,"For the trying to like you know talk to like be like Okay, this is clean I know it's clean. that's usually who I can pull like when I can try and pull myself out of that headspace you know, and I mean I tried it in like Okay, you know there's my food I prepared it, you know, usually so let me know what you know I know what I did with it, you know I mean. But it doesn't always work, you know, obviously I have my days that are extremely bad. I think. I think the last few days it's been exceptionally bad, but. could just be the overwhelming amount of things that have been going on. um but yeah I think I definitely think the one where I can convince you know when I usually talk to myself, I usually can convince myself, but you know. Especially after like if i'm it means like pre packaged can you eat something in me like a granola bar kind of thing um I can usually get to that space where it's like Okay, this is pre packaged you know. nothing's touched it kind of thing."
383.0,Provider,"I think you want to really ask yourself to do a little more. All day long you know reminders that your home is clean when you're walking in your carpet, you know my carpet is clean I don't know. When you when you're doing other things, not just when okay now it's time to eat now i'm going to remind myself that I prepared this food it's something that needs to you know you need to re it's sort of like rewire your. deeply you know imprinted. nervous system from before of revulsion. And those are those are. childhood and young adult or young you know youth kind of memories are that those are the first Prince and so to get down to that deeper. level you've really got to be reminding yourself like as much as you can that you're in a safe place that you are in a clean place now you're the adult you're in charge there's no there's nobody, you know that is. you're you're empowered now you and you have been for a while you've been living out of your mom's House and you just want to keep reminding yourself i'm in charge i'm the adult. This space is safe, I am you know and then doing that you know quite often as often as you can think of it. To try to. turn your relationship to your food around. So it's just if you can do that, I mean that we can sort of put that as a homework assignment that you're going to really work on. As many times throughout the day as long as much as you can think of it just remind yourself that you have assured that your spaces safe from. Being unhealthy unclean. But i'm sorry, you had to go through that, as a young person that's really, really wrong."
11445.0,Patient,"Thank you. I think, also having Mrs frederickson come, it reminds not like she herself exactly, but our cleaning her like level of. expectations for cleanliness are very different, which is stressful so."
383.0,Provider,I obviously again she is your roommates.
11445.0,Patient,yeah my sister technically my sister's partners mother.
383.0,Provider,Okay got it.
11445.0,Patient,"What type of homemade I guess I live, you know but. So she owns the House. to pay for it. But she's coming for her other other kid birthday. doesn't actually live here live in the House, you live in petaluma no i'm not positive. Okay um but so she also grew up in a household but so her manifested in OCD tendencies. Okay, so she tends. To you know clean a lot, you know kind of a few very timely and. You know, and I have a certain way she does things, obviously, which is you know I understand. But my because I grew up. I you know my trauma medicine manifested a different way. I can go my cleaning it a little Askew so I can live in little like a little dirtier condition than she probably not like nasty. But so when she comes, I just have to be like I just overwhelms me like you know, knowing that i'm never gonna I feel like i'm never going to be up to standards of what you want, which I know might not be true like logically for her. But, like every time that, like the last few times she's come, you know where I do clean, you know, try to get things together, I feel like she always does, you know mentioned, to see that something's still out of place. So I just feel like i'll never be you know i'm never going to be in that spot that's good enough kind of thing. yeah so i've just been of interest about her you know. me trying her put things away she wants it, but I don't think i'll ever I don't think i'll ever be like that you know."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, sometimes you know. It is stressful to have people come and stay with you. you've got to put extra work and sounds like she's a little particular you know that. And it's a stressor that will sort of come and go, because she's going to come and then she'll leave and just kind of reminding yourself it's just it's a transient. situation. Why but uh yeah it is, it is stressful having company and trying to get everything ready for them and. Is there something you're looking forward to about seeing this person, do you do you like her, because you're."
11445.0,Patient,"Oh she's nice I don't I don't dislike her. You know she's she's always been really nice to me and my sister, and all that, so I don't want to have any like issues, you know how come that I can't say I enjoy when she comes either exactly you know. I mean definitely always every time she's like i'm kind of I dread it, you know both me and my sister like you know, not even a personal thing to her, but we will read it, you know. we're both you know pretty mentally ill and we're you know we're busy in a weird way of we're not like overly busy but we're busy for own you know our own self kind of thing. And it's just you know it's hard to you know be trying to recover and trying to do, I don't know if we're trying to recover, but also trying to do other things because outside stressors you know really affect my mental. illness so it's kind of like. it's a hard you know when trying to you know, a logically also get that life's going to be stressful there's going to be things in your life that are going to make you stressed, you know. But it's just hard when you're when you're already in a bad place and then you're trying to you know do other thing."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. Well, I think that um how long is she going to be there for."
11445.0,Patient,10 days.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, my that's a long time."
11445.0,Patient,"yeah she come today and then leave, I think, on the team. wow yeah whoa moment."
383.0,Provider,that's quite quite as day now why she's saying so long.
11445.0,Patient,"You know I think I she doesn't usually say don't watch you usually say you pretended like this long but partially it's been it's her her you know, one of our kids birthday Ben and the other reason I think she's been a doctor's appointment, or something. They have like she's going to look at like something going to start or something like that. So that might be, I mean you know, maybe it's pushed out further in the week you know kind of thing. So she's got to stay for that reason honestly i'm not completely sure of all the details, I feel a little bit out of the loop, you know we've tried to convince we try to get to know what's going on, but he wasn't really good about asking what's going on. We only found out a few days ago that you know what what time she was coming in and like you know what time she was flying in what she'll be in addition to the car and. You know she's staying committed to staying with us who's not even showing me that she's staying with us, you know because she. She almost you're going to save us in our House, the full time I think she plans on staying some part time here and then some part time in petaluma with with them."
383.0,Provider,"I say, well, maybe that will give you guys a break and it won't be a fall."
11445.0,Patient,"Right, I just wish I knew how long she was going to be, you know at this House kind of thing because I guess apparently she doesn't even know what this point. is fair, I mean. But it is a little stressful to not I don't like to not know those kinds of things you know it's just stressful."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11445.0,Patient,like to know.
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, I think that. You know you're just you're going with the flow you're doing the best that you can. Considering that she owns the home i'm sure you feel some obligation, you know to. Meeting her needs are accommodating her to some degree. So you know you're doing your duty and you're doing the right thing and sometimes that's stressful, but I think you know hope you feel good about you know just. Trying to do the right thing in hosting this person, while they're there and. And you know just proceeding as much as well as you can with just doing your own responsibilities related to school and things like that which really should be. As much of your priority I mean at this age, I really think you know you I would recommend you know that you keep yourself as a priority, you know your food your studies your mental health. You know just trying to get yourself, more stable and. address you know these these traumas and trying to overcome them and, and you know work on your education and then you know, do the right thing, as you're able. For these other responsibilities but. Think it's good you're you know how do you feel like you're. you're addressing your mental health in a way that is helpful to you and and just by being in bright heart health, how is that going for you."
11445.0,Patient,"Okay, I feel I feel like for not even you know, on bright heart, I just for a personal thing I just feel i'm not always. honest with both myself and with you, and not even in like a malicious way. I think I like to think in some ways, I like to. try and be more neutral than I really am. You know, but I think I think most of the time, I actually i'm not doing pretty i'm not doing very good, you know what I mean. And I feel like i'm not always honest about how about i'm doing. Which is my and you know again my. My own internal struggle to try and be honest with myself. You know so i've been trying to be more honest so, then you know, obviously helpful to be more on it."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11445.0,Patient,"But I still struggle with the. You know the communicating how I really am feeling. And sometimes i'm not even sure how i'm feeling, you know I do struggle with with being unsure how i'm really feel about something you know."
383.0,Provider,"well. let's just maybe talk about that a bit Thank you so much for bringing that forward. The first for the piece about not really being sure what you're feeling. that's. that's okay and and you know. You do want to initially kind of. Listen to yourself and see if you can understand what you're really feeling and you can also bring. You know, mixed feelings into an appointment or talk about well I don't really know but it's kinda like this, or maybe it's a little bit like that i'm not sure. As we talked about it sometimes you get clarity on it, you know, or if you get feedback, you can your therapist can give you some feedback on noticing like this that might bring more clarity to you. And in terms of honesty, you know, I think that you being honest with yourself that also is the very first cornerstone and then being in alignment with your honesty to another person that you trust. But a question might be to ask yourself, is what makes it hard for you to be honest, is it because you don't want to be seen in a certain light is it. because sometimes people you know one is be seen in a good, you know and whatever you know good light means to them, and so they don't want to you know there's could be different reasons why it's why you struggle with that."
11445.0,Patient,well.
383.0,Provider,But why do you think that you have this struggle with being honest with yourself and and.
11445.0,Patient,"I think partially it stems from you know a few reasons, but I think partially it stems from. You know, when I was you know younger. I don't feel like my mom. talked about mental health and a good way you know, like, I feel like. She always made it sound like to you know we said I don't want to be I don't want you to be on medication your whole life and that always made me feel like I shouldn't you know seek help. For that goes kind of just I always kid the fact that I wasn't doing good in order to just kind of you know, oh I you know I don't want to seek help because, then that will make me, you know X y&z. And I think one of the other reason is, I just. I don't think I want to be. not seen as like mental ill, but like I think mentally ill, I think it's just kind of one of those like easier to pretend that i'm fine then to. You know, speak out that i'm not kind of thing um you know which I did for a really long time in high school, you know I felt miserable but I didn't you know speak out, I just kind of dealt with it, you know and."
383.0,Provider,"And the suicidal thoughts at the time, and you know, whatever it was."
11445.0,Patient,"You know anything part of me at the time, at the time, thought it was normal, you know that everybody went through that you know that it was like a normal thing to feel you know constantly like you want to die, and you don't really want to be here and that you know. kind of thing and that you know. Your honesty, sometimes it feels like. guys on sometimes if you just feel like we're in a simulation and that i'm going to yield percentage of the game, the same, for you know you. You have what you basically own a family and you take care of that family, but if you leave them on how to explain it basically if you leave them through there you can control them. Or, yes, and let them do their own thing and so usually, when you let them do their own thing they don't do what they're they don't like take care of themselves kind of thing. Almost feels like that in a weird way. Where I feel like if I leave myself on like too long, I won't take care of myself, you know what I mean, which is kind of a weird statement but."
383.0,Provider,"help you sometime mm hmm well. We do need to take responsibility for taking care of ourselves. that's I think that's just part of life. There is a responsibility factor for taking care of ourselves. But to what you were saying before that, which was that when you were growing up you felt like it was kind of normal to feel like you wanted to die, and that, like. hit that you know net I hope you recognize that that is not normal again a word I don't favor, but it is not healthy let's put it that way to feel like you want to die, and that life is so terrible and you don't you know that's not it's not healthy and. I think that. You know it's sort of like, if you want to build a house, you make sure that the Foundation is strong, you know you make sure you've got really you know all the Foundation part of it, you don't put like decaying. pieces of wood on the Foundation, because it's you know it's not good it doesn't build a strong House so like, with your mental health, you know if your foundation if you're not feeling good if you're feeling. You know not well but you're not telling anyone about it but you're really not feeling well but you're going about your day to day. And the result is not going it can't be sustained over time because it doesn't have a solid good, healthy foundation that's why it's important that you are real about how you really feel so that so that you can fit you in you can heal those parts of you so that you're. On the Foundation not feeling terrible you know. I mean. Life is going to be a struggle and we're going to go through struggles, but. You know if you're, in essence, you know if you were true to yourself, and you actually having suicidal thoughts, then then that's you know that's what's that's not that's not sustainable in terms of having a healthy life over time."
11445.0,Patient,Right.
383.0,Provider,"So. I think you know, working with coping skills, can help to gradually. alter some of those negative feelings about life, you know i'm noticing your little Mickey Mouse there and. it's kind of like this images are so. Well they're kind of they're kind of old in a way from a different era, you know. But it's also a reminder that. Sometimes we need to cheer ourselves up with with cheerful exposure to cheerful experiences and fun things and Nice positive experiences and when you've had like predominantly negative experiences when you're a kid in your House, when you went home was really stressful. that's you know you want to alter that and give yourself as many positive experiences, as you can. You see. Try to infuse your. You know your consciousness with that life can be a nice thing than a fun thing and an interesting. thing and and and worthwhile, you know worth worth your being here. kind of thing. That makes sense."
11445.0,Patient,I think so yeah.
383.0,Provider,"So. So, are there any thoughts that you think you can take from this appointment today and. kind of integrate into your so that you feel a little bit less overwhelmed."
11445.0,Patient,"huh yeah I think the one where I can you know, try and talk to myself more about i'm in a clean environment will be helpful. No more I throughout the day i'm like Okay, this is my space, you know, and I have control over you know. You know that it's clean and that I know that I think. That will be good. i'm trying to think of what oh. Very. I have a bad memory so i'm trying to think of what else we suggested."
383.0,Provider,i'm giving yourself positive experiences.
11445.0,Patient,"yeah. I think that's you know I think I try to do that as much as I can, with anything else you know."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11445.0,Patient,"But yeah I think that will you know I can try and do more of those kind of thing, but I think you know I think I try to do that already, but you know."
383.0,Provider,Okay that's good that's good keep doing it if you're already doing it just keep doing it. Okay yeah Have you had any suicidal thoughts or are you having any suicidal thoughts.
11445.0,Patient,"Just the normal you know it's always just I don't want to you know I don't I don't want to be here, but not even the i'm going to go after we do it, I just wish I was dead kind of thing."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and what do those come up at night or in the morning or anytime in particular."
11445.0,Patient,"i'm just you know throughout the day, depending on what i'm doing or what's going on the nighttime typically is worse when i'm alone, you know what I mean like when i'm. You know just laying down in my own thoughts sometimes it's worse, but it's just depends on the day and throughout the day."
383.0,Provider,"How many times, do you think you think that thought throughout the day."
11445.0,Patient,"fair amount. Probably, at least at least three times a day, if not more, though."
383.0,Provider,Just the thoughts of I wish I were dead type of thought.
11445.0,Patient,"yeah yeah just passing like Okay, you know it'd be easier if I was dead."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
11445.0,Patient,let's have to deal with things.
383.0,Provider,And what protects you from acting on those thoughts.
11445.0,Patient,"feel guilt, you know guilt. i'm a coward I can't I don't know how is the wrong word I i'm not even scared for what's next you know, and I mean, some people have a whole thing where it's like. I think, also i'm not i'm not I don't really want the pain before death, you know because it's not going to be nice, you know well, I guess, to the extent that depend on how you die but yeah I just I don't know, I think, mostly it's just guilt. kind of thing."
383.0,Provider,guilt. yep delta toward toward yourself for guilt.
11445.0,Patient,"In general, geared towards the people around me. You know I want to have to deal with it, but they will."
383.0,Provider,Okay um. Are there times when you don't have so many spots.
11445.0,Patient,"Rarely, but when i'm doing usually, when i'm distracted. So that's my cat again when i'm distracted sometimes I don't have them, but I have to just be distracted it's not really a. You know. More of just and doing something that usually, when i'm like out in public, where you know you'd like when I go to. We went to the ren faire a couple weeks ago and usually I can you know when i'm distracted by doing something that's you know fun, you know I usually don't have them because it's been doing something that's nice, but then you come home and it's still kind of one of those things."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have. Do you i'm. Sorry. Douglas. Well, we created a safety plan for you back in May, and you have a copy of that safety plan."
11445.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
383.0,Provider,um. i'm not sure if your thoughts of wanting to die are related to you not feeling good in your own body and self or if you're feeling disillusioned by LIFE external to yourself.
11445.0,Patient,"i'm both. You know, I think. You know it's hard to want to live, when you know i've talked about it before and but you know capitalism and and I feel we're having to work to. Having to basically earn the right to live kind of thing, where, if I have to you know make money to even exist as a person, I feel like i'm just a product of. If i'm not productive you know, then why am I, you know you know doesn't feel like I you know if i'm not being productive than it's not like i'm really living because, like you know we have to pay for things i'm not earning money than you know I can't live. So you know there's that whole thing of your whole life to kind of kind of be having to try and find a way to make money. Right right, you know."
383.0,Provider,"And in terms of you know your mom and what you're exposed to, I think you you weren't exposed to somebody who had difficulty with that. right because she was on disability."
11445.0,Patient,"Right yeah yeah for most of my life yeah. But it's not even that I just don't I don't want to be a product of that I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't want to feel like I have to earn money to be to exist, you know why, can I just exist and not have to worry about necessities. You know, and then you've got the climate crisis so at some point, you know. that's that's it's already damaging you know it's just going to get worse and and I, as a person can even you know I can recycle and I can I can do those things you know take take shorter showers, but the real issue is corporations, you know they're the ones pumping all the. You know gas into our ozone and all that stuff and destroying it and you know, there was just that oil spill."
383.0,Provider,I know.
11445.0,Patient,down over in San Diego.
383.0,Provider,"gosh I know it's just just just and very, very devastating."
11445.0,Patient,"it's just disheartening you know what I mean to. to feel like you know and we're also on a time you know we're also just on a time you know crunch anyway kind of thing, where we only have a certain amount of time to live in, you know, in the long run, you know and that's that's. 50 years or 80 years or you know 20 years whatever you know, whatever comes up."
383.0,Provider,You mean as a human or as a.
11445.0,Patient,"Species as a human, you know as a human, we got you know we only get a certain amount of time to let. You know I feel like I don't want to be doing I don't want to be wasting like wasting is not the right word but I don't want to be doing something that I don't like. In order to to exist in order to have to make money to be able to survive basically. So you know that's partially a struggle right now i'm having a big one actually is trying to figure out how to you know make money but also not do something that I don't like and that will just make me more suicidal you know. which has been a struggle."
383.0,Provider,In terms of thinking about what are you what are you going to invest in as a career in a career as a career.
11445.0,Patient,"yeah both now in the moment like getting a job now and then, in the future, what you know what what that whole kind of thing."
383.0,Provider,"You know. me mo I really think these questions are important that you're asking, and I think that. firing up some. You know what I have to be part of the solution, rather than you know just. get swallowed up by the problems. We need young people that want to be part of the solution to these problems. There is a big problems out there for sure I mean absolutely and. I really do believe that. You feel better when you feel like you're part of fixing stuff or at least saying, I want to make a meaningful contribution, I want to do something to help fix these problems and i'm. i'm just gonna die trying, I mean if we're all going to die, why don't I want to die, you know why don't we die trying to make things better. and doing you know getting getting kind of fired up about that."
11445.0,Patient,"Right. I think it's one of those things where even I will you know, to the extent I agree, I you know I do want to be more you know I do like being involved and trying to change the way things are. But also, you know and. And and along scheme. I you know I think it's worth it, to try and change things. But I still have to exist and now and. You know I felt as it exists now. Where. I have to deal with still trying to do things like make money in order to survive. Right now right, even if I can. Even if I can you know, eventually, if we can eventually get to a place where we're not you know where we can where basic necessities are met, without having to work for them. I don't think also be around for it. But you know, I have to exist in the now."
383.0,Provider,"Right right, but what one one perspective that in terms of like working and to make money you know one time, I heard this I thought was really it was kind of insightful that. The thought that you know. You have you been given a life. Work is an essence, you know the rent that you pay to because you were given a life. You know so it's kind of like we do we kind of do our efforts to. To doing work, and you know, and this we're all going to work gets there's you know our work, our efforts are reimbursed, not all the efforts and work that we do is reimburse but a slice of it is reimbursed so it's it's kind of like you know. If we think of the back, and you know more agricultural type of societies that they really didn't really depend so much on money but they depended on if they were out, you know we're. hunting or gathering or creating or you know working the land to get the food, so that they could exist that work needs to be done in order to get the food to just just you know make people be able to survive, so there is just an inherent relationship between work and survival."
11445.0,Patient,"Think, so I just I didn't want it, I didn't ask to be born I didn't ask you exist, you know kind of thing I think I struggled that a lot I didn't want to be here, you know, and I didn't get that choice. And so I think was and I get you know, to the extent in order to you know to do things like get food, you know, because we have to someone doing the job to do it. But there are people who like to do those things, so you know, even if we were to even if we were to stop you know if some people didn't work because they just wanted to do other things. I know people in my life, but just like doing those things you know in retail I people, just like to do those things. And so I think it's just one of those things where i'm like, why does it only because, like. Why are necessities not included with me existing as a human being, just like i'm not saying I shouldn't have to pay for the you know for. I don't know my my books that I want you know anything that makes sense because, like that's something that you know that's something I want to enjoy. But why do my things that I need to survive require me to make money to survive because it's one thing if I want to almost farm them myself. Because, then you know trading of goods and services, almost feels almost feel better than it does to exchange money in that sense, you know what I mean."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. And, and you have you have a point with with those with that. But, but to satisfy I think. I mean, if you want to work toward a society and There probably are people there's a movement of. Like let's get rid of money let's just trade goods and services and have it be without money you know kind of thing like here's a bunch of blankets, you know and. You know, and a new system, if you want to be a part of that and be one of the you know, contributing to the that endeavor you can be and, like you said you live in the now and today. And you know it's the money thing, but that is tied into. I do some work if I were sitting in a in a you know, on a tribe, and I had I. You know everybody's got to go out and tell the land or kill a few rabbits and you got to go out there and you know to fill your belly and that's just part of the way things are. Set up. So that when you go to work it's not such a light cross that you're bearing you know such a heavy weight, because that heavy weight on you have like. That heavy weight on you, is. Bringing you down. You know."
11445.0,Patient,"I just think it sucks you know I don't know I don't know, whatever it is, to say to stop I think I think i'm stuck in not just it's hot. You know, even if I can understand something we have to do it just sucks."
383.0,Provider,"Right right The thing is, and that's where it will suck less it's when you. you're you get the education and you go to work in the morning and you go and do something that you feel is meaningful, but you can actually say I feel good about this job so when you get the paycheck. you're like you know what I went to work and I did something that I felt I felt good about. You know I feel good about you know there's not it's not 100% but it's it's good good enough type of thing. So I think that that's Why then, when you go to your other questions about what am I, what kind of job you know what kind of what is all this education where's it going to what kind of work do I want to have. Because you, you know you're smart person I mean you're very, very intelligent and you can you can do work that is meaningful in this world, and then, when you're done at the end of the day, you feel good about it and. You know you don't just feel like you. You know, put a one of those time cards in and and and your eight hours at this meaningless job. I. think that. I mean that's my hope for you and you're at that age where you know you're giving these things thought and you're. Trying to come up with a solution and I think that that's excellent you know I i'm just hoping that your suicidal thoughts get reduced. And that you invest in. In your life and your you know and. And we could have a debate about whether or not you chose to be here or not, because I think that that could be debated as well."
11445.0,Patient,"I mean. If we're going in the sense of that I chose to be here because I didn't die yeah but we're going in illegal. it's illegal to commit suicide. there's just a lot of reasons, but I know what you mean."
383.0,Provider,"Well, we don't know why I mean I was speaking more like you didn't bring yourself here, but sometimes some people think we we did bring ourselves here. We didn't choose. Some point you know to say, I want to be born and that's why you got born. With those are more you know this, those are those are out of the scope of. counseling."
11445.0,Patient,As it kind of means.
383.0,Provider,"But I think that if you do think of your life as a gift. And that you have some responsibility to your life into being born. And to doing you know, to do what you can to to make the world a better place, then you feel a little bit more purposeful when you wake up in the morning. So. Well, I will see you in group, and I think we hope if this has been helpful for you. and Please give us a call if or you know the Suicide Prevention hotline if you feel like your things are going in not good direction in that regard. Okay. All right, i'll See you in a couple of weeks. Again, or individually, do you know when your appointment is or would you like me to read."
11445.0,Patient,"To me, I haven't written down."
383.0,Provider,it's just the same.
11445.0,Patient,it's something.
383.0,Provider,yeah.
11445.0,Patient,"Oh, my."
383.0,Provider,you're doing good work.
11445.0,Patient,Thank you.
383.0,Provider,You are.
11445.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,Great see you on Monday.
11445.0,Patient,"All right, bye."
383.0,Provider,"bye bye. Okay suicide risk assessment for Hannah flashy mo Tracy I would say she is low, to moderate risk. She is reporting daily thoughts of passive thoughts of you know better off dead, but she has some pretty significant pro protective factors of being close with her family members who she resides with her sister and sister's boyfriend. a feeling of guilt of what other people would have to cope with if she did that to herself. But. we're still going to definitely need to keep. focused on. You know, doing the suicide risk assessment checking for suicidal thoughts at each encounter and helping her reduce depression and increase a sense of hope and life. So again, if if you could. articulate in the note that she is having some increase in suicidal ideation with no intent or plan. That would be a good thing, thank you."
