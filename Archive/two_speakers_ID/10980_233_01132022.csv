233.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. In the process, as we talked about in the last group we had been giving you the two milligrams but then there was maybe a confusion and they came back at one milligram so you've got both of them. My hope is that, through like therapy and activities will be able to get away from the results and maybe decrease it. Maybe that would be nice i'm not sold that we absolutely need to do that, right now. you've been taking the two milligram maybe keep taking the two milligrams would."
10980.0,Patient,Think yes. And that night.
233.0,Provider,"yeah and that's the only time to take it absolutely.

10980.0,Patient,"Well, I was taking the one, and it was still happening so that's when you prescribed me the two."
233.0,Provider,"Okay let's stick with the to them at some point, all right good good. Good at some of your goals that you've been listening in the survey has been weight loss and exercise. Tell me your thoughts around what."
10980.0,Patient,"I was doing really good I mean mean gwen had a plan, and I was sticking to it pretty much but holidays kicked in and I. Was."
233.0,Provider,"boy isn't that the truth holiday home can be difficult for a lot of those things, so I."
10980.0,Patient,gotta get back on it.
233.0,Provider,"Okay, what were you doing for exercise."
10980.0,Patient,walking straight just stretches and then walking.
233.0,Provider,"Okay, good, and those are great options right, so I know that your long term goal is to get away from the suboxone."
10980.0,Patient,and eventually yeah. Right we'd love to.
233.0,Provider,"Knowing about your arthritis we got to come up with some plans of dealing with the pain, then as that comes up to, because, as we get rid of the suboxone the pain is going to come back up right."
10980.0,Patient,"And it's still there, so that worries me."
233.0,Provider,remind me where you feel the pain from the arthritis.
10980.0,Patient,"it's my my back my lower back and then it comes to my hip because i've got precise and my hips have a really big huge ball and when I went to see the doctor about it, he said it was beside this from my back. So okay wanted to do was give me a shot and I didn't want it."
233.0,Provider,"Okay yeah fair enough, obviously I don't have those tests and I don't know what's happening there, but certainly the shots they're usually steroid shots into the stuff and that helps with the inflammation so that things can heal up and feel better. The. The physical activity that I think is going to be most helpful for you is if you're exactly saying stretching and walking great low impact things that aren't going to stress the back in the hip other things that can be very helpful are also water aerobics or water activity. Those help to support the body right you're not hitting in jarring like one would be if they're running or other. Rather situation, something that can be very helpful and if you're open to it is yoga yoga is essentially stretching. Right so having a set class to go to or a set group to go to that you know that you're you're going to and is scheduled can be very helpful with that consistency of getting in and and doing it."
10980.0,Patient,Okay.
233.0,Provider,What are your thoughts on on a class like that classes and yoga specifically.
10980.0,Patient,"i'm not opposed to it, I don't try it."
233.0,Provider,"Okay, do they offer classes in your neighborhood there in your town."
10980.0,Patient,I don't know i'd have to check into it.
233.0,Provider,have to check into it yeah.
10980.0,Patient,Because. I don't have a primary care doctor. I mean it's like pulling teeth. To get one.
233.0,Provider,"I was going to ask that was going to be a follow up question, because I know that's a difficult for you to all throughout the state, and I think. New Mexico hit 7000 cases of covidien yesterday yesterday so obviously cold, it is fighting and that's limiting the amount of access that's available for those primary care appointments also it's a reality. So that's still trying to push that and trying to get in will be important helping out with the the heartburn you've got that hiatal hernia you know, we want to make sure that you're you are getting taken care of that way. With the pain taking things gradually working on these stretches lowly things should improve slowly things can really get better I would expect with that arthritis though it's not going to cure the race."
10980.0,Patient,yeah.
233.0,Provider,and helping helping your range of motion will be good. The other part but.
10980.0,Patient,"Something happened to my shoulder like a couple of years ago. Well, I guess badly about four years ago and it's never been the same since. yeah I mean it's awful it hurts so bad at tingles all the way to my fingers. yeah like the same thing with my arm."
233.0,Provider,"yeah so there might be some room for physical therapy with the arm also I don't know if there's our traders in their next raise needed or whatnot, I think, looking at the long term, of coming off of the suboxone and managing the pain, knowing that pertain won't be gone. But, knowing that it can be managed. Still and tolerable, and you know just accepting that it's there, I think the stretching the yoga your general physical activity will be really important for that. Okay."
10980.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
233.0,Provider,"Excellent so yeah you think they're as we talked about you had mentioned that you were not a smoker I have that on your list. That you're not a smoker so i've taken that off your list that's good there may be thoughts of decreasing medication, like the lexapro the melatonin these other things as time goes along but we're not there at this point we'll just keep things going. Or are there other questions that you had around this stuff."
10980.0,Patient,not really.
233.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean."
10980.0,Patient,Just everything we've talked about where my questions.
233.0,Provider,"Yes, good good it's nice to be able to settle in and talk a little bit more about these and have a longer term plan, instead of the quickness with groups. When things happen when we can't do this stuff."
10980.0,Patient,So yeah good.
233.0,Provider,Good um well we'll work it from there i'm going to get that two milligrams of prison sentence for you it's not going to happen immediately probably more like towards one o'clock or so don't get that taken.
10980.0,Patient,"Okay, I think I have refills i'm not too sure."
233.0,Provider,"Okay, I think. Probably the refills on the one milligrams of my."
10980.0,Patient,Get okay okay.
