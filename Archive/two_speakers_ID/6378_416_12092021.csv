416.0,Provider,Hello.
6378.0,Patient,I was late first so you don't have to apologize.
416.0,Provider,we're both running a little late. How how has your week been.
6378.0,Patient,My week has been good i'm. Nothing exciting to report.
416.0,Provider,I mean some of. The lack of drama is exactly what we're going for sometimes right.
6378.0,Patient,"But yeah it's it's been pretty good that way I started working a couple weeks ago, maybe a month ago, and so just kind of like getting used to to things that work."
416.0,Provider,remind me again what you do.
6378.0,Patient,"So this is a startups i'm doing a lot of things outside of my role, but I originally interviewed for a sales role, and so I work at a company that helps babies go to sleep."
416.0,Provider,it's really you yeah.
6378.0,Patient,it's the most emotionally intelligent group of people i've ever been around and they are also loving yeah.
416.0,Provider,What um. what's it called can I am I allowed to ask.
6378.0,Patient,"yeah it's called battelle be way be a ti E ll E and the the original sleep consultant who started the company she's like. it's everything i've learned in the past year about trauma and emotional regulation and how it starts early except she's like doing it she's like doing the thing and teaching kids all of these emotional regulation skills and teaching parents, how to do that for their kids."
416.0,Provider,So it's an educational platform. That way to do.
6378.0,Patient,it's like parents will call sleep consultants for their babies. And so it's kind of like doing it at mass like over zoo like remote sleep school.
416.0,Provider,Fantastic my God everybody needs that.
6378.0,Patient,"yeah I cried when I first saw that website, I was like I feel so safe here."
416.0,Provider,that's lovely yeah and working in a place where you feel really connected to the mission and have a purpose that's priceless.
6378.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I took a huge pay cut to come here in terms of like what other people were offering me, but I was just like there's no price there's no price on how good I feel here. You know I could go to any software company and sell whatever. But like this is, you know I i'll never have this again. You know, so I feel really good here for the first time at a job. Land yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I wish I would have known about that, when I was first all."
6378.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,Would it be great.
6378.0,Patient,I would never want to be a parent now because there's so much information online. And you're constantly judged for how well you perform at parenting and there's just like no way to know what the right way is.
416.0,Provider,Because there is a. right way.
6378.0,Patient,"yeah but there's just so many so much pressure on you as a parent to like. Do it right, or else you're a poor mom or something you know and like. I don't like that. I don't know that but I love that the idea that you're talking about and there's there's some opportunities for repetitive work in there for you, I can hear."
416.0,Provider,"That the idea that you know I mean are the emotion regulation Center in kids brain doesn't really mature and tell their early teens like usually 12 or 13 if ever, sometimes those things get delayed for other reasons. But like just being able to emotionally regulate just expecting kids to do that on their own is not realistic, and there are scientific reasons for that so when we're punishing kids for having tantrums or we're punishing kids for having big emotions. they're reacting negatively to them, it is harmful so learning that you can tune into your children, you can see what's behind the behavior. and be present for them is really lovely and it's also easy to see how emotion regulation can get set wonky. Right, so when we aren't met with kindness when we aren't met with understanding. And our as adults, it takes us longer to figure out how to regulate our emotions and we become this regulator more easily and we don't have the skills to bring ourselves back down right because we never learned those because kids co regulate with their parents until about 12 or 13."
6378.0,Patient,"Until I started here and I was like oh my God, I feel so naked know you know everything about me because i'm unregulated i'm like constantly excited and like. You know it's. yeah it's amazing co regulation I didn't even know I never met anyone who regulates well except my partner, which is why it works right."
416.0,Provider,"But is my anger yeah so you found somebody to co regulate with. yeah and and then we learn these skills right, this is why, like there's method behind our madness in therapy right so so much about. About therapy with adults is about emotion regulation and a lot of those skills are connected to mindfulness and they're connected to knowledge and they're connected to your senses getting connected to your body. learning about wise mind stepping backwards all of that stuff isn't emotion regulation. That we didn't learn as kids because it. You know, depending on the generation also wasn't valued and it wasn't well understood."
6378.0,Patient,Right right yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So it's fantastic I love here it's like music to my ears i'm I love hearing that you work for a company that is doing that kind of work and starting so young and helping parents really understand that. And, and there are so many opportunities in there to kind of recognize your own needs and your own unmet needs and go like huh."
6378.0,Patient,"it's hold the person who develop these methods, I was like I just follow you around and write down everything you say."
416.0,Provider,Really background.
6378.0,Patient,I that's a great question she's like a baby whisperer.
416.0,Provider,But she she must know have some sort of therapeutic background or at least like intensive child development background.
6378.0,Patient,"Definitely child development, not a therapist though everything she's saying is like a therapy session every single thing she's saying um yeah just like everything she says about emotional regulation and co regulation, I mean just everything you said right um yeah. yeah she's amazing and i'm just like I will she's like okay well, if you want to follow me around you can come live here with me and Connecticut and like. Because the company needs it right and i'm like okay fine little does she notes for like me. But yeah I just feel like I have a big crush on this company and i'm like smiling when I talk about them. i'm just new for me."
416.0,Provider,I have a crush on your company to that so great.
6378.0,Patient,it's like amazing.
416.0,Provider,"I love it it's. kind of how valuable, that is, I mean I think about oh my God all the parents that I would love to refer to a company like that um. I have a lot of these conversations in therapy, with people and i'm always encouraging people, you may have heard me do this in group or like if you have kids. Do these activities with your kids they co regulate with you right teach them the skills now right, you can meditate with your kids you can do mindfulness with your kids."
6378.0,Patient,But if the parent around it.
416.0,Provider,"yeah you should talk with them about using their senses to calm talk with him about being in their wise mind demonstrate to them what that looks like and how you regulate right, like all of those things are so critical and. it's a bonding opportunity for you and your kids it's a Co regulation opportunity but it's also like you're both practicing critical life skills and it's so fun to do that work parents love it."
6378.0,Patient,Really they're into it they'll do it.
416.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah I mean. Patients that I have that are like in, especially in a really rural areas where they just like. Access to professionals and. A lot of them are in recovery and i'll say things like that to them like you know there'll be like I don't have time to do all of these things you're asking me to do and i'm like will do them with your children. don't do these away from your children. I do it with mine. And I can testify as to like how powerful of an experience it is to help them learn these things go there well equipped they're going to have high eq when they're older. and Confidence really cool yeah. So, speaking of emotion regulation."
6378.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,What are some things that you've learned.
6378.0,Patient,"A co regulation is a big thing I. Honestly, I learned that I don't know how to emotionally regulate like I thought I knew like a little bit no nothing, I think, because what is it like the skills that we're teaching babies like Can I take this class too because. yeah what is it like just I realized that even simple things like I had to learn. I had to learn the sensation of being cold like I didn't know that that was pain. And I didn't know that like if i'm called my body like i'm going into like a freezing mode because i'm literally cold but i'm so used to enduring discomfort physically that like I didn't know that I could. That it was it was painful and that it was like impeding my ability to do other things because a part of me is thinking like oh i'm uncomfortable i'm uncomfortable. Because I just got used to like muting that."
416.0,Provider,"So so much of it for you is learning how to just reconnect or not reconnect just connect for the first time really to physical sensations. And I know you mentioned. Last time, your experience of doctor's office. yeah and how vulnerable you feel around some of those physical sensations."
6378.0,Patient,use it this connecting.
416.0,Provider,"Well, and it makes sense right, and when you disconnect your safer right your brain it's your brains way of keeping you safe. So connecting in can be scary right it's helpful in so many ways, but it's also a vulnerable place to be when you don't trust the place you're in or the people around you to keep you safe."
6378.0,Patient,"Yes. The point where like I should move because my neighborhood so loud and that's kind of hard for me sensory wise, but then I can't imagine living with new people, and now that I finally feel safe. You know it's really hard for me to imagine living with other people who are who might not happen know these things right and or who move with other people and trauma informed away is like I can find those people, but you know it's it's hard right now in the Bay area."
416.0,Provider,With neighborhood even.
6378.0,Patient,i've been opened oakland by the lake. So I live right by James and. Maybe Steve yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I don't know where Steve was, but I know James is over there yeah."
6378.0,Patient,"yeah yeah see like even like when I first joined group and me and James are like oh my God you're in oakland let's hang out, and I was just like we're a boy. And i'm a nice person and boys get confused. i've never had a close guy friend who didn't want more. And so, at that point i'm just like it must be me that, and so I don't know what it is, and so I just stopped I. same thing with kyle like I was like oh let's just be friends i'm just like I don't think so I At first I told him like you know, like I can't do that with boys I can't be friends with boys, right now, and he got like upset and so I was just like okay. But anyways yeah boys are scary. To do friendship with."
416.0,Provider,"More of their um and there have been specific instances in your life, where it's been particularly bad."
6378.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I had a boyfriend who I dated for three years and I didn't know about this until recently, but he, like I didn't know it was abuse until recently. But he. The worst part I think was a gaslighting and. You know that kind of stuff every day, but that also led into like sexual assault every day. Until I didn't consider it assault right because he's my boyfriend and I love him and it's just kind of like that Gray area where you don't really want to do it, but like just get it over with. And I think until you know I would say no, each time and he would just like oh come on just a little bit blah blah blah, and eventually given just to get him to stop. And then there was one time, where I just was finally like no I don't want to do this and said no, like a dozen times and I think that was the time that like broke me I haven't saved since then, but. yeah and there are other times with other people, but I think. That one was the most confusing."
416.0,Provider,it's a lot of broken trust and mixed messages and yeah gaslighting.
6378.0,Patient,yeah um. yeah so now it's just. it's just been hard to trust.
416.0,Provider,"You mentioned some sensory sensory sensitivity as well. And with, can you tell me more about that."
6378.0,Patient,"Oh yeah so it's gotten worse and worse over the years as similar situations have happened. So things like oh my gosh it's so weird but like sounds I jump all the time now all the time I constantly not so much anymore actually. But for the first few years I lived here I would constantly check behind me because there's this window right here, and since we've been at home for the pandemic like I can hear some of the guys outside hulu my neighbors. and You know, they just scare me that they're just normal people they don't do anything wrong they're just normal people. are not even mean or anything. same thing with you know I constantly have to be facing the door every single time I sit down at a restaurant my back has to be to the back, I have to be facing the door, I have to have a wall behind me. When people are behind me like I I can't I can't deal with it like it's it's physically uncomfortable like i'm getting uncomfortable just thinking about it and. It took me so long to find a job because my last boss would jump at me constantly and so like I told him I had ptsd and I told him like not to do it, and he would constantly try to scare me anyway because it's funny to him, but yeah and that's me. yeah it's not and I didn't know that I could say anything like I didn't know I had rights around disability rights or it like I didn't know that it was illegal for him to do that. sensory what else touch."
416.0,Provider,What you're describing is a lot of hyper vigilance.
6378.0,Patient,super vigilant.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and then we were saying something about so that's with sound and like proximity to people."
6378.0,Patient,"Down proximity and then with touch like if i'm associating touch will help me come down, but there are times, where I don't want to be touched or like it hurts it hurts to be touched him of maybe that hyper vigilance again. But being held is difficult, sometimes my partner's the first person that I would let big spoon we because I couldn't have someone behind me for the longest time I always have to be big right. yeah thanks like that."
416.0,Provider,and When you were little when you were a kid Do you remember having some any sensory stuff back then like where you did the sound of wind or flags in the wind or. Where they're like certain textures of clothing that you couldn't wear.
6378.0,Patient,"This was after Enrique and after. i've had other partners after Enrique who are also. abusive. Emotionally abusive and and a little a little bit sexually abusive and so all of this ptsd i've noticed the past five years, just so much worse so."
416.0,Provider,So what i'm hearing inside the sensory stuff in the hypervigilance is so much about the ptsd and probably isn't as much of like actually a sensory processing issue and your brain that's that's something you were born with.
6378.0,Patient,I think so because I this didn't happen when I was a teenager you know definitely as I grew into adulthood.
416.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean it makes sense, it certainly can happen as a result of trauma I was just trying to figure out if there was like an inherent sensory processing disorder."
6378.0,Patient,never considered it.
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you're not describing anything that I would think of is a sensory processing issue sometimes and kids you see it in kids they seek sensory input, you probably see this at work right there kids were if the room is not completely black and devoid of all input. They cannot sleep. Right, because that sensory input is too overwhelming for their brains and there are some kids who didn't sleep anywhere. And they don't give a crap right. So there aren't like we are born with different like sensitivities to that to sensory input and there are sensory seekers and also sensory avoiders. And sensory avoiders you know, are the ones who you might like find in a dark room like constantly sort of you know shielding themselves and like little cubby and just. use it a lot with autism it's not necessarily the same thing, but a lot of times those two things are connected. And then their sensory seekers and they're the ones that look very ADHD they can't stand sit still. And they're the ones that like if you're going to walk. They can like, if I were going to walk through that door and have to touch 50 things on the way there, it would never be just like a straight line to open the door, it would be like oh what's this and what's this Oh, you know, like yeah. that's that's a sensory seeker they want that sensory input or they're constantly moving."
6378.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,So it doesn't sound as describing you necessarily.
6378.0,Patient,"When i'm outside I like to touch things like the texture of plants and stuff but I plants have different textures. yeah I don't know that's that's funny, though, that you bring that up. I do, I just like textures."
416.0,Provider,"Well it's great to know what's what's sort of organic to you, and like what's Hugh."
6378.0,Patient,And what is trauma.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, a little bit so that we can. Because if this was organically you I don't know that we would change much about it right. Right."
6378.0,Patient,"That, if this is."
416.0,Provider,Because you want to work on yeah.
6378.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah I know we're reaching the end of our time, even though we were late, so I don't want you to have to rush. It."
416.0,Provider,"For now. we're already scheduled for next week right, so we don't have to waste our."
6378.0,Patient,Okay yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And do you need to go, or do you have a few more minutes."
6378.0,Patient,I have a few more minutes okay.
416.0,Provider,In terms of the complex ptsd that you have. How is it for you to go outside and interact with the world and be around people.
6378.0,Patient,"interesting question because, like. it's I love going outside and while I used to. I used to love going outside and my favorite thing to do is walk around the lake and compliment anyone, because that moment that smile that like oh my God, thank you, like I love love watching people light up because it makes me feel good. i'm like yeah and. I used to love that well now it's scary I think because of pandemic, but in same thing, like i'm the person who would bring all my friends together and have them over and cook for them, and like just entertain and. Parties if I, I would say, I would have to be familiar with the space. Like the physical location like i'll if I know i'm going to a party at a particular bar or something and have time i'll go to the bar before the party, just to be familiar with the surroundings like people in strangers we're fine."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
6378.0,Patient,Now it's a germ issue.
416.0,Provider,"Okay well yeah so you tolerate that stuff pretty well, it sounds like. I mean, there was a German issue and that's like. that's not a mental health issue that's real right. we're worried about. um okay so and when you go outside more frequently and you interact with the people behind you and around you and they're strangers like whatever you know you're hanging out for a day on the lake everybody always like gathers there or whatever and. Are you able to like do you find that the more you do that, the easier it is and and the less hypervigilant you get or do you find that that doesn't affect it."
6378.0,Patient,"Never did it as like I never did it actively kind of like taking note of that that's a good question, though. I think so because, like maybe it's like the first I can feel it sensation like when I go outside like of course hypervigilant but the more i'm out there kind of gets smaller."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
6378.0,Patient,yeah it's definitely an anxiety in my my head.
416.0,Provider,"So i'm gonna give you a little challenge, can I do that. And this week, if you have time as much as you have time I would love for you to get out and like you know, take a walk outside go around the lake you know, have a picnic with your partner out there, whatever. And, knowing that you're going to feel uncomfortable. As much as you can, and I want, if you can to. check in with yourself before and after not even necessarily during, but I want to see. You know how do you how do you feel before and after and then, if you can even like I don't if you want to read it on a scale of one to 10 or something right like one being the least anxious and 10 being like the worst. And if you can just keep track of it, and then we can look at the end of the week, and when we meet next week and just see like does exposure to this reduce your anxiety over time. That sounds it yeah with the look on your face."
6378.0,Patient,"it's uncomfortable but I know you're right, and I know it will decrease."
416.0,Provider,Is there a message that you can give yourself. To kind of get you a little more enthused about this idea.
6378.0,Patient,I just worry about covert I live in a neighborhood where nobody where it's Nice and people are like coughing around and like I know if I wake up earlier there's less people if I go out at night there's less people. yeah it's definitely covert anxiety that I do want to get over it.
416.0,Provider,"So you out, you know take all the precautions where you're on mask stay outside i'm not asking you to go to any restaurants or anything."
6378.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"stay outside. maintain your social distance right so i'm definitely not saying, like a crowded place or anything."
6378.0,Patient,Just yeah.
416.0,Provider,"You know around the lake or you know finding a spot that's in the middle of the grass and not like super proud, you know take."
6378.0,Patient,"I missed the outside, I really messed up."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah so knowing that you're controlling what you can control around germs right and taking all the precautions and. see what you're able to do. And then chart it for me if you can okay.
6378.0,Patient,"i'll try my best OK OK. I will be praised, thank you, I appreciate, I appreciate the encouragement to do this, I would not have done it on like oh."
416.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean. let's just see it as some scientific data right. it's a little experiment. And if and if it doesn't help if it doesn't work if there's something that needs to be adjusted we're going to meet in a week and we'll adjust it."
6378.0,Patient,I know it over I just gotta do this thing.
416.0,Provider,Right.
6378.0,Patient,yeah we shoot it.
416.0,Provider,"You can do like a start with maybe a short walk away from people, and then you know branch out a little bit more into longer stuff and."
6378.0,Patient,So scared. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"you're scared of cokehead i'm scared of coconut yeah yeah. um now, this is not my area of expertise, but my understanding is that. You with your mask on being vaccinated and outside and socially distanced that the risk of transmission is very, very extremely low to the zero."
6378.0,Patient,"Like i've heard it's just that that one friend, you know who did all the right things and got sick anyway, and now they can't taste things and I know that's supposed to be like this, the most minimum of side effects, but if I can't taste things like food is everything. Everything everything. yeah so that's honestly that's the biggest side effect on whiskey i'm afraid of, I know there are worse ones, but that's the one where i'm like I did all this work to feel happy and now you're gonna tell me I can't taste. um. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah that one's getting through that in 95 there's no you're good. Okay, all right."
6378.0,Patient,Thank you Julie.
416.0,Provider,"rejoin the world a little bit, and I will see you in group next week."
6378.0,Patient,"And okay go to group I was one minute late, not even one minute like 30 seconds. yeah anyways."
416.0,Provider,i'll see I by here.
