79.0,Provider,True you're so lucky she.
18180.0,Patient,she's fantastic.
79.0,Provider,"Yes, awesome so good so with this session i'll kind of do a little bit of different you know just ask them kind of questions. That can be taken to the next RD she can kind of work off that. To work on a little bit different but before we do that and you're like hey that's really good that's really hard to check in you."
18180.0,Patient,um I think the arby's went really well on the way home last week i'm.
79.0,Provider,cool my. blanket goodbye window and I get.
18180.0,Patient,"It i'm really proud of, like the the arby's cuz I was like kind of nervous about it when I got home when I was driving home, but I was really proud that it was like. Everything went well."
79.0,Provider,"Sony good job, what did you end up gay."
18180.0,Patient,I got a. The classic beef and cheddar listen mozzarella sticks and some water. Nice.
79.0,Provider,yeah really good stuff to. Go and how did you eat it.
18180.0,Patient,"I don't I just. Like pulled into a spot. And just ate it in my car, because a lot a mm hmm yeah."
79.0,Provider,that's awesome okay that was her plan nice job that's really cool anything hard.
18180.0,Patient,"And I had some spaghetti last night, and I was a little bit difficult."
79.0,Provider,What about it.
18180.0,Patient,Just like. Because we also have garlic bread with it so i'm like oh that's a lot of carbs like that's. Like I just ate until like I felt full and like guys still have something like my bowl but that's okay.
79.0,Provider,"Okay cool yeah and i'll plant, the little image of you know, the folks that Italy that eat they they do a ton of cards and there's that lovely little blue zone where people live, you know extraordinarily amount of people live to 100 and they eat like 90% carbs. Is a lot. So, and it just you know it's it's really more about quantity of carbs right. know many other factors. cool nice job anything else any questions you have or I don't know kind of find breaks up my. put my phone if I don't really need it, but."
18180.0,Patient,and I don't think there's any questions or anything.
79.0,Provider,"go ahead and do the questions, then just kind of the final you know. One of the things I always like to ask versus you know what do you feel like is the most been the most helpful, you have made a ton of progress in a short time, like you've just shifted. You know, most of the time you know this short of a time that's usually like taking we needed to go longer, but really i'm like I think it was worth it for you, even to do this short amount of time which is. incredible to me. But, so what has helped you know shift, especially with the food and eating."
18180.0,Patient,"And I think like having accountability like writing it down in my journal was like helpful on and like not really. I think I think that was like the biggest help was like making myself accountable to it i'm like I know I still need to like work on that and, like work to get into like the full like three meals and three snacks and. But like I feel like I felt like I was like letting myself down if I didn't fill out like at least all three meals so like that was kind of like using like myself Guild has a motivator be like you need to eat this. i'm like fill out that spot. And I just got a new planner and it has like a little meal section in it, too, so like that'll help keep me accountable like during the school day. And I think also just like. be more honest like, especially with Scott you'd like hey like this is like I really don't want to eat, but can you help me like you make me meet. yeah and like just letting him know like when things are actually happening so like not reaching out like when i'm already. too far in."
79.0,Provider,"That, I think that's so beautiful and I just want to emphasize the importance of that connection. Really really cool I just I always I always marvel at that how amazing it is that when you bring somebody else any honest with them and there's a positive relationship there you know, and both wants to help each other and leaving the good it does the healing."
18180.0,Patient,"Like I know, like in the past i've definitely lied to him about like using behaviors and stuff i'm like that's been a little rocky for us and at some times. Where like. it's definitely a lot better when like i'm honest with him for like multiple reasons, because when i'm being honest and to like i'm not like trying to go behind his back or anything like that and also like he knows when to help me and like when I need help yeah."
79.0,Provider,"Really really cool hey tell me about the urge to diet, where you out with that in the merge purge to lose weight and have any of that lesson or rainy mouth it."
18180.0,Patient,"And I feel like i'm kind of like a little bit better than one like a few weeks ago, but like it's still there. I don't like with all this like wedding talk for my sister like that's been like indicting spent like a big thing to like talk about. Right, when I was home for beers like that was a thing that was constantly brought up like. I said, like oh like we have a wedding to worry about now let's, we have to lose weight my mom was saying that she has to lose way. My mom was like making comments about my sister's wait, so I know that probably mentioned making comments about mine. And like that's just was kind of like stressful and I know this, not this weekend, but like next weekend so like the 16th we're going wedding dress shopping for my sister, and I can only imagine it's going to be worse, then. So, like i'm just trying to push those thoughts away and being like i'm fine the way I am I don't need to you know, like if anyone's going to say that, like I need to lose weight for the wedding i'm just gonna be like sorry that's that's a me thing that's not a new thing to comment."
79.0,Provider,"Agreed, and it is where we live in a distorted society like like sometimes I really think about pain, this is weird. You know the whole changing your body shape anyway, they were okay that's cool. If it does come in, where you start to want to pursue that and to want to lose weight, and I mean I I don't recommend it right we've talked about why. The 95% chance that either worse than eating disorder or makes you can future you know it's a huge thing. When when that if that does come, how are you going to approach that how are you going to deal with that what I mean, because as. I am only saying this because i've seen it before I think it's probably going to come to you that's going to be a time where you're like it almost sounds exciting or. Somebody convinced with you or I don't know something will happen here like like you try that but i'll do it the smart way, this time, you know. And you know, but what what kind of a plan to have for that."
18180.0,Patient,"I think, Chris telling Scott. and be honest with him about it because. Like we've been going to the gym together and that's been helpful."
79.0,Provider,And cool.
18180.0,Patient,"Because, like, I know that, like. I won't push myself when he's there are like if he notices, I will feel it kind of stopped me. And so I think like just making sure that, like I. just go to the gym with him and. And like make him like if he doesn't go to the gym I don't go to the gym type thing like if I really want to do some bail take latte for a walk but that's not going to be. Like a super. big thing, especially now it's cold out."
79.0,Provider,Let you hurt her.
18180.0,Patient,"she'll. she'll look at me, maybe i'm sitting right here."
79.0,Provider,You can carry such a good lesson there right.
18180.0,Patient,"Like yeah. yeah I can always tell when she's getting tired, but she walks like a normal dog then. She doesn't like bounce all over the place. And I think like having a latte like kind of be that person for me when i'm feeling like that, when we go on walks and also like. Telling myself like i'm not going to the gym unless scott's going to the gym because, like he has a pretty good balance right now, like because he works late, sometimes it just works, a lot of hours. So, like being kind of using him as like my guide almost and. We also don't have the scale in the House, so I think that'll. help with that. Okay it's in his trunk right now."
79.0,Provider,"cool Nice. yeah tell me more about your commitment to just take care of yourself, you know now here in this."
18180.0,Patient,"and Right now. I really want to take care of myself, so I can get a job and stay in my job. Because like i'm not going to finish school if I keep letting myself do this. Especially like this close to graduation."
79.0,Provider,So.
18180.0,Patient,"i'm counting down the days already. And like i'm not going to be able to like if I get a job I don't want to. pull myself out of it because, like or like have to leave as soon as I get it because I can't keep that can't take care of myself. And I also just like i'm really ready to move on with my life like Scott and I are talking about like getting engaged later this year, and that means like. I don't know like one of the biggest things is like i'm like I want to be able to have kids and I know if I keep like doing this like there's a potential that I won't be able to. And like that's a big thing like that was kind of like a big like oh no factor and because I grew up, I never wanted kids and then, as I was like. getting older, maybe I do, and like I don't want to. Like my stupid decisions get in the way of that. Like for me myself, like me and my future like."
79.0,Provider,"A life, you want to live. yeah good. mm hmm that's really cool you don't appear for you and your future. Okay, and so the questions i'm going to ask you some specific and go through some questions, and I think the best thing to do is kind of share screen with it and let me get that pulled up."
18180.0,Patient,"Also, the thing that we did the last time about like the bad thought, like the middle thought and then like the counter and thought that really helped to like. That helped a lot this. These past couple of days, when I was like Do I really want to do this, like Is this really something I want to eat and then like kind of like doing it that way."
79.0,Provider,That was that was a.
18180.0,Patient,good way to help like reframe it.
79.0,Provider,"I just opened the wrong thing i'm like that's not the one I want the other. Okay yeah, this is the one alright. So this is Ian competence and it's just kind of a good, as you can be passed on to somebody else and kind of shift over it, and and just for you to kind of know that this is, you know we talked about intuitive eating and eating competence is is within that. And it's I think it's a good survey to kind of just go and we'll take it now and then I would suggest you know you assessing it, you know a few months down the road. So basically i'll just ask the question and you say either always often sometimes rarely or never so i'm relaxed about eating. I am comfortable about eating enough. Regular meals. Often, I feel it is folks that I like."
18180.0,Patient,somewhere between often and sometimes.
79.0,Provider,Fair yeah I experiment with new food and learn to like it.
18180.0,Patient,"Also, between often and sometimes."
79.0,Provider,"If the situation demands, I can make do by eating food I don't much care for whether it's leftovers."
18180.0,Patient,Sometimes.
79.0,Provider,I eat a wide variety of foods.
18180.0,Patient,I say often.
79.0,Provider,I am comfortable with my enjoyment of food and.
18180.0,Patient,Sometimes.
79.0,Provider,I trust people to eat or not people I trust myself deep enough for me.
18180.0,Patient,Often.
79.0,Provider,eat as much as I am hungry for.
18180.0,Patient,Often.
79.0,Provider,I tune into food pay attention to.
18180.0,Patient,I don't say that the rarely.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and that and why just because we positive just a minute what what's there that makes it difficult."
18180.0,Patient,"I just don't think like I always use distractions when I eat, so I like I don't really pay much attention like I always drink yeah so that's something like I have been wanting to try to do a little bit more. Like. Even this morning at breakfast I was on. Like I was on my phone. So I think that's something that like. I need to do more, of sorry to me no."
79.0,Provider,"No, no, no you're totally good yeah and I think that is such a great goal and to taper that and yeah and it's surprising like super like well what would I do that let's just try it and see you know. Maybe not the whole you know if you're trying to make sure you're eating taking 20 minutes to eat a meal, maybe not the whole time you're just sitting eating maybe the first. Half and. You know. Maybe take a little break here there or. Something like that and let's see Oh, I make time to eat."
18180.0,Patient,Sometimes.
79.0,Provider,I eat until I feel satisfied. I enjoy food and eating. I consider what is good for me when I eat.
18180.0,Patient,Always.
79.0,Provider,I plan for feeding myself.
18180.0,Patient,i'm a little confused about that.
79.0,Provider,Like grocery lists and creating somewhat of a menu or.
18180.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
79.0,Provider,"Always studying it. And even in your schedule of your day not being like scheduling things back to back so, then you don't have to be. yeah I think the 15 answer I find interesting right to consider with all all the time, you know. Which. can be over right, sometimes we say an eating disorder nutrition fault, but we don't want to care about nutrition until we don't check. And, once we have taken some emphasis off of it, then we can go oh OK let's look at this and what the potential nutrition like maybe I do need a little more fiber in the diet, or maybe I could use a little bit more water. More calcium, because gosh I. know I avoided calcium or dairy foods for so long that Okay, I need to drink a little more calcium."
18180.0,Patient,"I just find myself like reading food labels a lot. i've been like really trying to get away from doing that. Now I still catch myself. Doing yeah and. I don't like in the grocery store like I don't pick them up, when I look at them. Like I don't like a look at the back, I just."
79.0,Provider,"Did you, you know I need this. yeah yeah Okay, so you have made us make progress."
18180.0,Patient,"Additional times i'll look at it like once I get it in the apartment and I was like oh. But then I was like well I needed to make this so. And there was a time I was like measuring out my food. Like I went and actually bought like a second thing of like measuring cups so I could like. But like I kind of like put those away and like I started using them for other things like one of them's in like in our dog food thing, and I was like i'm not going to. use it after I put it in our dog food. yeah I like one of them like Oh, this one, specifically for coffee now."
79.0,Provider,"yeah so like just cool. that's cool okay let's just you know pretend let's say you do have a child he's six years old. And he you know started going to school and he comes home one day. And he just learning three things like Tommy what's this word and he reached calories on the little cereal box or something right and he's like joey said to me how bad, how are you going to explain to him about calories."
18180.0,Patient,Tell me tell him like calories or what we need to fuel our bodies.
79.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah and be like yeah it's a good thing, it has calories because that's what we love. And just can you don't have to go into full discussion with a little kid but yeah and just continuing to kind of do, that is, it as you look at those labels. kind of elite and a lot of ways, when we're trying to learn something new it's okay to kind of make it simple for ourselves and say. good thing it's got to finish up that they need that. there's such a thing as fatty acid deficiency. You know other problems we get. dang if I didn't get enough calories I will stop. You need to just kind of speak that basic like I will tell people that sometimes. Like when i'm talking about colors and stuff and i'm like wait. Our calories that and they'll like go on and start say that but i'm like no really our calories bad for humans and finally they're able to say no they're not but they still feel wrong insane and i'm like. i'll be dead."
18180.0,Patient,"One of the things about like that's. That like is really stuck with me from the last year I was in treatment and like when you eat a salad with no dressing like you're not absorbing the. Vitamins and I was like. What. I always heard the salad. So, like that was like."
79.0,Provider,They meet each other it's kind of like they pick each other up.
18180.0,Patient,Like that's like keep with me. Like That is something I like never been it like I have not been able to forget yet. yeah like when people eat. salad dressings i'm like. that's. that's zero. you're getting nothing out of that you're just being a rabid at that point.
79.0,Provider,yeah and you're not a rabbit.
18180.0,Patient,Like I love salads they're great but i'm like.
79.0,Provider,hey are great.
18180.0,Patient,For the different.
79.0,Provider,You know i've been loving the. And if you guys have kosta vetoes or but it's that cilantro lime dressing.
18180.0,Patient,Oh. had been lovely good.
79.0,Provider,"Lately it's so good, like tomatoes cucumbers are like on a pita as a sandwich end anyway."
18180.0,Patient,That sounds good.
79.0,Provider,"Okay well it's like an ex going to ask you, oh red flags so just so we have these down for the next dietitian what are some red flags that okay yeah i'm i'm buying into more diet mentality, or even just sort of mentality that I am recovery, how would you know."
18180.0,Patient,"And I think if, like I start measuring my food again that's a problem and. Honestly, if I purge again I think that's a problem, like at least like multiple times in one week. and or even like. three instances of it happening, I think that's a problem. Because i'm not going to like sit here and pretend that would be perfect about it. But I think like knowing when the boundary is i'm like i'm doing it again. and I think, also when I start like I take too long at the grocery store because i'm like. surveying everything. and Probably when I start like restricting to like less than i'm gonna say, less than two meals, a day with like no snacks."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so they're all great. Anything that you're you know. that the goal this next week or a couple weeks kind of your goals that you're like i'm gonna keep doing this, these are the things i'm going to be working on."
18180.0,Patient,um I really want to see like I usually pack scott's for the night before. So I want to get into the habit of also packing my lunch because lunches one of those meals that i'm like. I like I always purposely push off lunch because i'm busy or I don't have time or things like that. So I want to like make it a point to make lunch. The night before so it's even if i'm like home that day I can just go and grab it. And i'm worried about that. I want to keep tracking everything. like just to make sure that I can keep myself accountable.
79.0,Provider,uh huh.
18180.0,Patient,"And i've been noticed like I really like that the water bottle I got fantastic and i've been noticing like even when I drink one of them, and I don't like I don't drink as much the next day i'm like really thirsty. So, like, I think, like just kind of paying attention and, like my thirst cues and be like. You need more. it's kind of like. Keeping that up and like listening to that in. And just drinking, at least, at least at the minimum of one of those a day."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, those are really, really grateful, I was really good self, care tell me a little bit about the self care that you're like you've started doing you want to continue to do and things that maybe in the future as a future self care goal."
18180.0,Patient,"um. I really want to like keep taking at least 30 minutes to myself, every day, or like doing an activity, I want to do, even if that means, just like sitting on the couch and watching like a movie with Scott, quite honestly, i've been obsessed with animal crossing because um."
79.0,Provider,yeah.
18180.0,Patient,One of our friends got me animal fantasy for Christmas so i've been playing that. whole lot but i'm okay with that because. it's actually it's like a mindless.
79.0,Provider,"Anyone a break, I mean yeah."
18180.0,Patient,and
79.0,Provider,"If you weren't doing that, instead of sending your tests."
18180.0,Patient,"That would be a problem. And, and also cross stitching because I just finished the one out. And then i'm going to start making one for our friend's wedding and then i'm making one for my sister for her wedding so i'm giving myself plenty of time like during the school year to get those done."
79.0,Provider,"yeah that's awesome I love those and i'll throw in again i'm going to bring in the whole weight loss thing because you're going to get hit with it, I just know you are too many of my clients that just get hit with the weight loss thing coming in, as I call it a siren call. That the siren starts to call and it just you just convince yourself it's going to be okay, this time. You know, to pursue it and self care can be the way you kind of go, you know you start to have that weight loss desire come in, or somebody telling you something or or whatever, and your self care can come and go no we're doing self care. You know, and you can do the whole I like I see you wanting the weight loss, and you can kind of. You know, not be beat yourself up about it, like our culture, so obsessed with it, of course, those thoughts can write our society kind of has an eating disorder. And, but your determination to stay, true to yourself care can be the thing that helps you go no we're not going to focus on that you're going to take care of ourselves that's number one. So keep doing the self care. So good so important, so yeah I hate it I hate. fascination and the way our society and it's hitting our kids and I think that's why I hate it the most is i'm seeing younger and younger kids and it's really heartbreaking. What we're doing to our kids. And I honestly just."
18180.0,Patient,it's horrible like I deleted social media off my phone's feeling my I think that's all i'm seeing on social media at the moment i'm like I can't do that.
79.0,Provider,"Good job see self care man, you know and you're like."
18180.0,Patient,i'm. gonna go down a bad road if I keep it on.
79.0,Provider,"yeah we're only human like being reminded things over and over again, like the whole marketing things is it seven times and then you start to soften the person toward anything."
18180.0,Patient,like that.
79.0,Provider,"Something like that, like we have to recognize, we are humans and we're just vulnerable and sometimes we just have to draw a line."
18180.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,I have to do the same thing I yeah. it's just yeah and i'm I try and teach my kids to you know just make sure that you're aware that you're vulnerable. Okay anything else that you feel like we should be on here to help the next I should know how to help you or. anything like that.
18180.0,Patient,"think so. and What I was going to ask if. There was any way that I could like have the list of the assignments for the week, like all the weekly assignments. I can keep doing them."
79.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
18180.0,Patient,"Thank you yeah. Because I was listening to zoe's like a letter to a good food bad food. Yesterday, and I was like that's probably something I should do eventually."
79.0,Provider,"I would, I would like to read her letter mail after to send it to me."
18180.0,Patient,They were really good yeah.
79.0,Provider,"Are you and are you only going to keep in contact, or are you gonna keep in contact with anybody else."
18180.0,Patient,I know for sure i'm going to keep in contact with Mina because people go to penn state. For an upstanding each other. And I think probably olivia or katie for sure.
79.0,Provider,"Call. Nice good deal, and you know about the outpatient group right."
18180.0,Patient,I did not know.
79.0,Provider,"That so it meets on sat every other Saturday. Okay, I believe, and it's this Saturday, they are meeting and it say what time is it it's 730 Pacific time. So that's 10:30pm and on Saturday. Okay 1030 to 12 your time."
18180.0,Patient,Okay. that's yeah I was like 730 7:30am on a Saturday mornings little rough to.
79.0,Provider,"know those specific times out. i'd have a hard time with that and i'm at 830 oh yeah i'm. going to ask you one that I think what was it. can always email, you know I guess. I can't remember what it was now. Oh no I know what it was, it was just with the when I email that to you I wasn't going to ask a question I was just going to say you know, show that to the dietitian. and share those with you know the responses, I think that could be. Late to a really good conversation. Okay it's I didn't get to work with you very long, but you know just the way that you're open, and you know willing to bring in hope and all of those things like so awesome just keep going be fully recovered go for that you can do it and."
18180.0,Patient,If you the.
79.0,Provider,"Freedom is worth it, the way you'll teach your future kids if you do end up having kids is amazing, we need that. We really do it just makes sense we don't need to I tell people all the time, are we in an advanced society or not, because sometimes the things that people say in the way they think and the way they eat them like. That is not the way I would picture and advanced society."
18180.0,Patient,Like we're going backwards for a lot of backwards.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and. we're taught to distrust ourselves and all of the thing and i'm like no we actually need to learn to trust ourselves and to accept it by testing ourselves that's, the only way to best care for us and to know what's even going on. So keep keep growing that trust you're growing with yourself cool."
18180.0,Patient,"Thank you. Thank you for all your help, over the past couple of weeks."
79.0,Provider,"yeah it's been short but you've been awesome so thank you for joining and sharing it's been good. All right, take care of. YouTube okay see you."
18180.0,Patient,guys bye.
