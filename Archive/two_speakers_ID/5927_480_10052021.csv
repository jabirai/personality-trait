480.0,Provider,"hello, I apologize for being late, my group ran over."
5927.0,Patient,"Oh it's Okay, how are you doing."
480.0,Provider,"i'm doing well, how are you doing."
5927.0,Patient,i'm not so well.
480.0,Provider,"All right, well tell me about that."
5927.0,Patient,um. I guess. I mean i'm kind of feeling manic. I was doing really bad two days ago. I started cutting again and I was feeling really terrible. and Yesterday I wasn't doing too bad. i've been kind of stressed out though because. i'm watching the House for my grandpa somebody i'm alone all week and I always get really bad when i'm alone so sure sorry about that.
480.0,Provider,um so you started cutting what was the motivation for cutting.
5927.0,Patient,Release I guess just.
480.0,Provider,"A release of the negative energy that you were feeling. yeah Okay, so what was going on at that time that was making you feel overwhelmed like you had to release."
5927.0,Patient,"um I don't know I just felt. overwhelmed I guess I just felt over for it, I was. Nothing that really triggered it. It just kind of I guess you're just building up. Because I mean i've been going downhill for a really, really long time so i'm just thinking about that and. You know where I am it just. was feeling really."
480.0,Provider,"So. refresh my memory, are you taking medication for your mental health."
5927.0,Patient,"I haven't really been taking my meds for the past few weeks okay I. was just never really feel any change and I always forget to take them and it just. It never feels like they're enough anyway, I don't feel like i'm taking the meds for everything that I should be taking meds, for I just take I just have two things, but so I have all this other stuff that I still need to get covered or need help with but i'm only taking. Two minutes it's just never really did enough for me, so it was forgot to take it."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Just a couple of questions."
5927.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,"You said the last few weeks, you have not been taking your meds."
5927.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,When you were taking your. meds. How long were you.
5927.0,Patient,consistently taking your.
480.0,Provider,meds before you wouldn't miss meds.
5927.0,Patient,"Probably a week and I missed a day or so and then maybe I would start again after, so I think I probably like two weeks. And then I just always forget enough to that nine of it so taking you again."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so the one thing that is true, with almost all psychiatric meds is that you need to take them consistently for at least a month, every day, like you're supposed to be for you're going to have enough of the MED built up in your system that it's going to make a difference. I think, maybe what you're experiencing is you want this kind of instant gratification like Oh, I took my meds for a week I should be feeling awesome but i'm not so they're not working so what's the point and taking them."
5927.0,Patient,mm hmm.
480.0,Provider,"Is that kind of the feeling that you get like you, are you're waiting for this like Aha moment but it's not coming."
5927.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's also more subconscious to where I just i've never taken meds in my life for and whenever i've been sick, I hardly ever taken medicine for headaches or anything so he is not in my. In my mind to start taking the medicine remember remember."
480.0,Provider,it's more of a mental thing a mental barrier. yeah so what meds are you taking right now.
5927.0,Patient,"um. I don't have them on me, I think, in the House actually."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so another thing with medication that's really important that you know is that a lot of meds that you take, depending on what it is you don't ever want to take them and then just stop taking them because it will send you into kind of a tailspin. It can make you know, but it can also make your moods very erratic."
5927.0,Patient,i've felt that when i'd stopped taking them definitely.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I think the first thing before you mean obviously you can talk to. The medical provider that prescribed your minds, but I think before you have that conversation of hey they're not working is you really need to give them a chance to work so maybe, so we need to come up with a plan. That you can follow, so you can be taking your meds every day consistently when you're supposed to take them and then reevaluate and like four weeks and say, are you feeling a difference, because if you take. distantly for four weeks, and you don't feel any changes, you still feel in that dark place that you've been feeling in that manic place then maybe a Meta adjustment might be something that would need to happen. But until you get a chance to work with your body and get your chemicals balanced out um you don't know for sure. Does that make. So a lot of times what I recommend and, for instance, my son he's 13 he takes months for ADHD. And he, like a lot of times we'll forget to take as much as know course he has myself to remind him, but the one thing that I really try and encourage is you know set alarms on your phone when your alarm goes off, you know it's time to take your meds. um and so maybe that's something that you can try is to set your alarm on your phone, so it goes off every time you need to take your meds. And then you take your meds and after so long it will just become a habit, right now, you don't have that habit because you've never consistently taken meds. And so you have to build that habit it's kind of like when you go to the gym people say you know after 21 days you don't even think about it anymore you just go it's part of your routine and so that's that way with anything you build that habit, but it just takes a while to get there."
5927.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"So it'll be difficult at first like when that alarm goes off take your meds and i'm gonna have to take your meds but, after a while. it'll become. Like a habit you won't even think about it you'll just know all right it's noon it's time to take my meds. And then your alarm will go off so you'll you'll know it's time to do it before your alarm even remind you, but that alarm is there kind of as a safety net. So if you do forget that alarm goes off and says, did you take your meds."
5927.0,Patient,Okay. So.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so maybe try that um you know and like I said, if you don't if you don't feel like your meds are working after that four week period of consistently taking them. Then it's time to reevaluate because you know, sometimes there needs to be made adjustments um, but you have to give them a chance. So um and that's probably why you feel. You felt really manic is because you stop taking your meds completely."
5927.0,Patient,it's actually a few weeks ago I stopped taking them I kind of after i'd went camping I never got back on them.
480.0,Provider,"So Tommy after you got back from camping you never started them again. yeah and then these last couple of weeks, you said you've been feeling really manic like extremely manic, to the point where you started cutting again is that right."
5927.0,Patient,"yeah i've also just I forgotten how long i've been here I. i've just been losing my grip on reality so much I i'm i'm just confused feeling so terrible it's just sometimes at night, it just builds up and i'm like. I can't do this anymore I don't want to be here anymore it's been going downhill, for years I don't want to keep doing this and I just get to a point where I can't really."
480.0,Provider,"So prior to. Your going camping. Will you taking your men's. And last time I talked to you, you felt like you were in a pretty good place."
5927.0,Patient,Like you.
480.0,Provider,"were pretty positive just came back from camping had a great time you know it everything seemed to be not great, but not bad, like you were just kind of in a content spot. So. Then you stopped taking your meds and then you fall into this really manic dark place. epic up until now, and now we're talking again and you're telling me things on wow. So is it possible that maybe your meds were making a little bit of a difference because when you stop taking them after you got back from your camping trip everything just took a turn for the worst."
5927.0,Patient,"yeah um I definitely remember feeling it because I i'd stopped taking them. During the camping trip so, then I couldn't really feel the effects, but I remember before when i've stopped taking them it's like for the next week afterwards I just feel really terrible uh huh. So i'm not sure if it's the magic this time because it's it's been so long after i've stopped taking them. it's been about three weeks. But I I I do think the meds were hoping a little bit when I was taking them because I could feel the effects and when I stopped taking."
480.0,Provider,"uh huh so and that was just that small build up in your system because, like I said, you have to take them consistently not miss any doses. To get that build up to see how they're going to work and if that's the right Douglas and if you never get to that that point where it's at the right level. Then you don't know if they're actually working because you're only getting like half of what you should be getting because you're missing doses. and medication also has what they call a half life so if you stop taking a medication today that you've been taking for let's say three months, and then today to reckon i'm gonna. i'm not i'm not going to take my medication you won't feel a full effect from that till probably a week or so later because your medication has like. an extended life so even if you stop taking it that build up in your system will keep your levels pretty good for a little bit and then they'll drop off if you're not putting that chemical back in does that make sense. So. My concern is when you're telling me at night that you're having thoughts of I can't do this anymore I don't want to be here. Do you have so those mean those are suicidal ideations have you have you had plans to do something, have you made any. Steps towards actually ending your life."
5927.0,Patient,"um, I guess, since they start cutting again um I have been getting more. i've been thinking that I could do that to end my life and also, I have the meds to that I was planning on taking before to just try and overdose on those but um. I yeah I do feel, sometimes like I might I was going I was planning on. suing myself for Inpatient because I was doing really bad. But I realized like I couldn't do that because of because I wouldn't have anyone to watch my cat my grandpa's leaving so I need to watch the House form, so I couldn't and that's I was getting really stressed out but i'm going to be alone here for the next week, and so I don't."
480.0,Provider,um. That is that's concerning so when you tell me that you're cutting is becoming more frequent and you're having thoughts of. I could just take a bunch of meds and then I could cut and that would just be done that's really concerning because you're going to be alone for the next week. And since you've had all of those thoughts very recently that really put you into our high suicide risk category um and so it's very. it's very risky to have you be by yourself at that makes sense yeah. So is there anybody that can come stay with you.
5927.0,Patient,"know, I was, I was would have asked someone if they could because i'm really concerned about being here by myself, too, because I just hate I don't hate being alone, it just makes me it's so bad so but there's no one who lives around here anything there's. Everyone all my friends are far away to college okay."
480.0,Provider,"So, have you been drinking at all lately."
5927.0,Patient,"No, I couldn't find any I was looking yesterday. But this is not in house, so I should be OK."
480.0,Provider,"OK, so you haven't been drinking, but you have had this association. Always. Yes, so you've had the dis association you've had the surge of anxiety. And the thoughts of not wanting to be here, those are all your warning signs that we identify the last time that we met. um. So, have you been used."
5927.0,Patient,"Sorry, it kind of curious. know you all right."
480.0,Provider,yeah I lost you for just a second so have you been using any of your coping strategies.
5927.0,Patient,"Oh, what are the coping strategies."
480.0,Provider,i'm one of them was to smoke marijuana and watch videos.
5927.0,Patient,"um yeah i'm. Not I don't. The party have left isn't really strong, so I mean i've been i've been trying to but I don't really have a lot to keep my mind off of stuff um uh huh. But i'm trying."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, and then. Talk yourself out of it redirect your negative emotions walk on the beach, have you done any of those things to try and get yourself through those negative times."
5927.0,Patient,"No um. it's hard for me to really get out and do anything. In general, like even just getting in the shower is like so hard to do, I think you know getting out of the houses. To go and get anything even is really hard to think about doing okay um."
480.0,Provider,What about meditation.
5927.0,Patient,um. I guess I could try to meditate again i've been doing i've been doing really bad spiritual spiritually for the past. few months okay be since i've gotten here I just been really in touch with it.
480.0,Provider,um so you had mentioned that you have Jordan and he's a close friend where's he located.
5927.0,Patient,Illinois.
480.0,Provider,So he's far. yeah What about Maxwell.
5927.0,Patient,he's up in Washington he's all the way up near the Canadian born border.
480.0,Provider,So he's far as well.
5927.0,Patient,yeah okay.
480.0,Provider,So um. Nobody that you can have. Come stay with you.
5927.0,Patient,"I don't I don't even know anyone here that's another thing i've been doing, really, really bad it's been getting worse because i've just had no human connection. at all and it's just stressing me out so much because I never taught I just never get to talk to someone never get to communicate with some another human being, it just. For months i've been stuck here with no friends and no not able to talk to anyone, and all my friends are busy with everything because they're out in college now so i'm just. I flew I just don't know what to do, anymore."
480.0,Provider,"Have you ever thought about doing like an online like support group for people that have mental illness, so that there's other people like you, that you could talk to."
5927.0,Patient,"um I do the group with bright home um. But i've never done anything, besides that."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's support groups out there for so many different things um site, you can find online so maybe you can't talk to people actually physically in person, but maybe you could find. Something that would work for you that you might be able to find online the of people that also have like anxiety major depressive disorder. You know, some psychosis things like that. um you know that also have the same have the same feelings that you have. Does that make sense. yeah okay so. um let's see. So let's just Google. yeah so there's like online depression support groups um. So yeah there's all there's all kinds of them and, basically, you know you just go on. And you click. And then usually it'll tell you here's virtual meetings, and so you can say i'm virtual meeting yes. So you can do anxiety disorders panic disorder and agoraphobia support page so um. there's just there's different ones, and you know you just look them up and then typically you know their virtual and so you can join them from anywhere. But I think that the big thing with you is you feel alone."
5927.0,Patient,you're.
480.0,Provider,"alone in your home you feel alone in your life, besides like your grandfather so when he's gone you'll feel even more alone. And just alone in your head is a you feel like you're your mind races all the time and it's so intense and you feel like you're just there alone there's just nobody to understand you nobody that can can help you to get through that. And that's why I thought, maybe a support group, you know, would do would be really great for you i'm. Your. The group that you do with bright heart. Do you participate in that group do you talk to people."
5927.0,Patient,"I don't really let I miss group a lot, because I either forget to go or I just really don't like going to it um because it's just like every group is the same thing, where we show up to do roll call for 15 minutes and then. He and then he we get told to read a certain part in some passage, or we. Or we all say like what we think our biggest flies out of these five things so we all, we all, then we go around for 30 minutes and we say. We say. Family and religion, and then we go to the next person and another not see any group so, then I never liked going because that's all we ever do is we just talk for. A minute each other and sometimes someone goes on for a really long time about what's going on in their life and it just I don't like going to it tougher because that's all we really do."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so one of the things with bright heart is obviously you know the requirement is that you go to group and you go to therapy sounds like maybe you're not connecting with the group that you're in maybe the the format of the group isn't something that works for you. Whatever it may be um you know you're always allowed to. speak during group so if you're really struggling with something that's a really good time to put it out there and really get people's feedback. Because, maybe some people have been where you've been and and they've tried something that's works that maybe you could try and that's what those groups are for is to provide support to each other, I don't know you know what group that you're in. But if you don't feel like you're getting what you need from Group then maybe talk to the group facilitator and explain that to them, and maybe they can help you to get more from group or maybe they can adjust that. The style of the group or something like that, so it works, a little bit better for you you'll get more out of it i'm just not going defeats the whole purpose, because then you, you know, even if you were to get something out of a group you're not there, so you wouldn't you wouldn't know. You know what I mean it's kind of like your meds you have to give it. Oh. You have to. You have to give it a chance and work with it. But my not going you're working against it by not taking your manager working. against them."
5927.0,Patient,it's contagious.
480.0,Provider,"So I mean does that make sense that if you if you don't actually put the effort forth to go to group you're working against the group, even if they. Even could help you if you're not taking your meds are working against them because you're not even giving them a chance, does that make sense. yeah, so I think a lot of where you're at right now in this dark place is just changing your patterns of thinking right now. You have these patterns of thinking that are really negative so changing that into i'm going to give my mother a chance to work here's my plan on how i'm going to do that i'm going to give my group a chance to work here's my plan on how i'm going to do that. You know, and with group they're consistent every week so let's say you have groups Tuesdays at 5pm, for instance. Central time for every Tuesday at 5pm So it goes off, you know 10 minutes before group and then remind you hey I have group and make a commitment to yourself in your health and your recovery. To be at that group. And if you don't like the way that the group is going changing so I mean I facilitate groups, and I have people that jump in all the time and they'll say. I really need to share this you know, like i'm really struggling with us, can I share absolutely that's what we're here for. So if you really are having a bad day bad week, whatever it may be that is where you share that mean you share it in therapy, but you also share it and group has those individuals sitting in that group with you, they can relate. they've been there and so they're going to be the best support to you. In any area, you know therapy is more of a. Of course we you know we listen and we provide support, but it's also. We want you to. be able to make positive changes so Then we come up with plans on how to do things and looking at processing through certain feelings to get to the other side. You know so like when you're in the dark places at night you're like I don't really want to be here anymore I don't you know those kinds of things. What is what is making those feelings occur, you know what is it about you and those and how you're feeling that you think that you would be better off dead. than alive."
5927.0,Patient,"um it's just. I just really never happy I guess i'm I can't remember the last time I was truly happy it's been years I. think like four years ago, I used to like video games a lot I played with my friends. And, four years ago. um I couldn't do it anymore I couldn't touch it I couldn't look at a video game I just I had no interest in playing them and then, as time went on. I i've never I still haven't picked it back up, I still can't bring myself to to look at one eye. And then, over time, you know I didn't watch movies anymore that just couldn't watch him there's never interested me and everything, I was interested in just went away. So, for the past four to five years, I have not been able to enjoy a single thing, and I have moments of happiness when I go out and I hang with friends. And then I get back and i'm not hanging out with friends anymore I just feel horrible and awful and the way that i've been living. And the way my mental health has been going it's been going downhill, for years, where I went from living with my parents and it was a horrible situation there, and then I ran away, and then I mean now i'm now i'm in the back of a trailer 500 miles away from my friends. With no interest in doing anything and no memory of how long i've been here, it just. I i'm just wasting away and I can't I can never find anything that makes me happy anymore so just. Why should I keep going if it just can see keep going I can't see any way to pull myself out of this, I mean i've. My whole life i've been living for if I just get to this then it'll all be happy, but just get to this, then I can do this and it'll be okay, but it's never came it's never once come so. I don't have any more hope anymore i'm not gonna I can't hope to if I can just next year, I can go live with my friends will probably not. I mean I don't have any source of income my mental health has not been getting better there's no way i'm gonna be able to do that I don't really want to try anymore I don't know I don't have anything that's gonna make me happy, in the meantime I don't want to keep doing this."
480.0,Provider,"Okay. So let's look at it, piece by piece so. nothing's getting better. So. you're saying nothing's getting better, but for a short time, like when you're camping things were better, but then you came home and things were okay until they hit that steep decline so, is it possible that things could be better if you took your medication."
5927.0,Patient,um I think. I think i've more things that need to diagnose and get more meds for i'm definitely shy of ADHD. But I don't have any. medication for that and I need to talk to him to my psychologists do about it. Isaiah.
480.0,Provider,"Isaiah okay. So you'll definitely want to mention that to him, the one thing with adult ADHD if you've never been diagnosed as a child is there's a tool that has that you take. On basically it's a test where they they test to see if you have ADHD and then, if you do have that diagnosis, then they look at medications to help with that. So I mean that's definitely something to look at and life can feel very chaotic when you have ADHD and your unmedicated absolutely very chaotic, because your brain spider webs in several different directions and you see you don't have focus on one thing. um."
5927.0,Patient,"So and it's hard to do with. OCD because then i'm I can't focus on anything, and then I also have all of these intrusive thoughts and stuff that is blocking up more spaces. So I just whenever I want to do something I will either get distracted from it, or you know well i'll just be thinking hundred more different things. than I, so I can just. Please my mind instantly uh huh."
480.0,Provider,"um The other thing is losing interest in things is a sign of depression, I mean that's that's just the. You know the base is you, you. When you're depressed you lose interest in doing things you normally would as one of the major science. um so obviously depressions an issue but you're not taking the medication you're supposed to be taking to help with your depression so that's not going to get better. The medication as prescribed he was to have to balance out those chemicals, so you do feel better so remember, we talked about let's give them a chance it's come up with a plan. So I think that's going to help the other thing that I really encourage you to do even the things that you have lost interest in. You liked them you love them at one point in time, if that was something that you really like to do when you are happy, so I want you to be able to connect those things like. When I was happy, I was doing these things i'm not doing those things anymore i'm not happy, so do you see how taking things out of your life that used to make you happy isn't going to make you happy."
5927.0,Patient,"I tried, I tried to do them all the time um but like playing video games always tell myself that i'm going to i'm going to do what i'm going to play something today i'm going to. try something i'm going to do something with a friend, but. I either when i'm when i'm doing it i'm just like I really wish I wasn't doing this right now, this is not fun at all, or I just don't even get to in the first place, because I get on my laptop and i'm like I that doesn't sound fun pedal I don't want to do that, so I. Just every time I try to even just."
480.0,Provider,"Say you're talking yourself out of it basically before you even get there um. But at one point in time, those things made you happy. yeah."
5927.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,"I think that the next thing is to figure out what makes you happy now. And the only way to do that is to try things, and so you know, maybe I hate to say forcing yourself, but you know, making a commitment to yourself. That every day you're going to do something for 20 minutes you know, like every day you're going to maybe like today for 20 minutes play your video games, even if it's if it's horrible and miserable and you don't want to. Just do it. Because, maybe. You are the one that's talking yourself out of liking it because you feel so bad about your situation and about yourself that you can't find enjoyment in it, but maybe if you. Do it a little bit every day you'll get that enjoyment back, especially. In addition to taking your meds regularly and getting back on a medication regimen that can help to balance those chemicals uplift your mood help you to not feel so chaotic and manic. Does that make sense yeah."
5927.0,Patient,"um I also, I think that the ADHD is also i'm borrowing me from doing stuff like that, like because I love to draw to and i'll i'll try to draw all the time and I just I just don't have the focus for it. And it just hard to like start in the first place, so I mean like I start I love to do art and when I start to do it, it just like I would rather be doing something else at this point like the same thing with the video games it's. So I feel like if I if I gotten if I started taking medication for ADHD, then I would be able to focus more and just do stuff like i'm like i'm supposed to like everyone else does. I can just do something and get it over with and. Without you know going to do something else or forgetting to do it, are. progressing regretting doing immediate we're uh huh look like that."
480.0,Provider,"yeah no absolutely um. So. I definitely can see, you know that connection, as well, that would be difficult to to focus and that's why I said, like short increments so. You know, picking today i'm going to draw for 15 minutes and then it's just 15 minutes set your timer on your phone do it for 15 minutes, and then, if you want to stop at that 15 minute point then stop. If you want to keep going keep going because there's nothing wrong with that, but if it was really, really difficult for you to do that task for 15 minutes, then after 15 minutes just stop and go do something else. But I really want you every day to do something like that. Because it's going to kind of expose you to the things you used to enjoy and it might spark something in your brain that says hey I enjoy doing this. Especially if you're taking your meds the way that you should because your chemicals in your brain are going to start balancing out and you're not going to be so manic on one day and then so depressed on another day. Can you hear me."
5927.0,Patient,I can hear you okay.
480.0,Provider,"So once some of those negative feelings start to subside it's going to open you up to be able to enjoy other things. Does that make sense. yeah Okay, so do you have a normal schedule every day that you that you follow they do you kind of get up at the same time, but about the same time, do you have any consistency in your schedule."
5927.0,Patient,"I can wake up and go to sleep at the same time I don't bother with direct time that I do those things but it's pretty much the same time, every sometimes every day that I wake up and fall asleep I usually wake up at about 1030 and go to bed at like 1130 at night."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so what I want you to do um do you have. Do you have a notebook handy already can you grab, one that has something to write with yeah. Okay, so you wake up at 10:30am 30 wake up. So, once you wake up in the morning is that when you said take your meds how many times a day or so so take your meds."
5927.0,Patient,Know once a day.
480.0,Provider,Once a day.
5927.0,Patient,Is that you take.
480.0,Provider,In the morning are you taking my bedtime.
5927.0,Patient,In the morning okay.
480.0,Provider,"So you wake up at 1030 so um. 1045. men's That gives you some time to wake up brush your teeth, maybe have breakfast whatever it may be, so I would say 1045 months um. And then, following that what do you usually do."
5927.0,Patient,um. I don't really I just kind of wing it for the rest of the day and that time I don't there's nothing that I really do.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's let's put a what this what i'm doing is i'm putting a schedule in place for you, because consistency. And structure are going to help you tremendously because you're going to know every day what to expect and you're not going to have to figure out what to put in your day to make it full and feel. satisfied to feel the satisfaction of life because you're already going to have a kind of planned out does that make sense yeah so you got up you took your meds. Do you make your bed in them in the morning, do you clean up your living space, do you do any of those things."
5927.0,Patient,Can you do those things as I go i'm.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
5927.0,Patient,"As they need done, then I usually do them."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's say 11 o'clock make your bed from like 11 to 1130 make your bed and clean up your living space. And it can be longer than that so let's say you start cleaning your living space and it's 1130 and you don't want to stop you want to keep going and keep going that's okay. It just gives you some structure to follow yeah so and then, after that, whenever you're done cleaning up your living space. that's when you're going to try your activity for the day so i'm, whether it be 20 minutes of video games or 20 minutes of drawing or. going for a 20 minute walk if you can go outside or sitting down and watching you know, a part of a TV show or maybe like a half hour sitcom you know something like that. i'm just 20 minutes is all your grand all you're going to focus on is that 20 minutes, but if you get to that 20 minute point and you're like Oh well, i'm really enjoying this then keep doing it. Does that make sense. Otherwise, after that 20 minutes, then you're done with that activity, and you can move on to something else. So you know, then you have some free time in the afternoon to do what you want um so typically in the afternoon when you have you know nothing going on what What do you do."
5927.0,Patient,"um. Are you side. By either i'm. try and find something to do like. Maybe. Look, for something to watch like a video or something or browse social media or. Go see what my grandpa is up to where. My cats up to or. I guess just that yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so during that kind of free space in the afternoon because we're probably around me, obviously, you have to have lunch, so what time do you typically have lunch."
5927.0,Patient,I usually don't eat lunch actually.
480.0,Provider,"You don't eat lunch. mm hmm Okay, do you eat a big breakfast."
5927.0,Patient,not really I usually don't eat breakfast either.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's one thing that we that you need to adjust to because your physical health is also going to affect your mental health, so I think when you get up before you take your meds. You know eat breakfast, whether it be a banana a piece of toast something to nourish your body."
5927.0,Patient,Before you take your meds.
480.0,Provider,"It also helps your meds work better, if you eat prior to taking your meds and you take your meds with a full glass of water. It."
5927.0,Patient,"Was that. Sorry, keep filling out might be me. Oh Okay, you know."
480.0,Provider,"All right, so so first off going to start having some breakfast whether it just be a piece of toast or banana have that prior to taking your meds take your meds with a full glass of water, it helps them absorb into your body better. um. And then have a small lunch so maybe around like one o'clock between you know, because you get up kind of late, maybe like one o'clock 130. You know, make something for lunch what is something that you like to eat."
5927.0,Patient,um these usually different stuff in the House.
480.0,Provider,"So you know something and it doesn't have to be a big lunch, but just you know something to to nourish you because your brain and your body needs nourishment in order to regenerate themselves repair themselves um. And if you don't eat Have you ever heard of that the phrase somebody's angry so they're like they're hungry, but they don't realize that it's hunger so then it comes out and like anger and frustration. because their bodies saying feed me so your body probably is saying feed me. Because it's hungry, but you don't realize that it's saying that to you because you're in this low state of depression and when people are depressed either they don't eat at all, or they overeat there's usually not a too much of an in between. So when people don't eat it all. You have to basically kind of force yourself to eat and that's where this structure comes in, so figuring out every day around between one into as lunchtime, and what are you going to have so that you can fuel your body to get through the rest of your day."
5927.0,Patient,um I guess like we have Sam I can make like a sandwich or something we usually have sandwich stuff.
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's perfect that's the perfect lunches just you know, make a sandwich just something, because your body is not used to eating right now, and it really needs to. get used to eating. that's going to help with your mood and it's also going to help with the way that you feel. Because you probably feel super tired and sluggish all day long but that's probably due to the fact that you're not eating anything your body doesn't have any fuel it's like trying to drive a car, without gas and are going to get very far. um. And then pick another activity that you can try different than the one that you tried in the morning, so basically you're just trying out things that you used to like so. um you know, whatever that may be, and I don't know if you like, to read or you know people like to do different things meditation look up. You know, different you can go on like YouTube and you can do like a meditation like video or something like that, like self care. Where it kind of walks you through step by step."
5927.0,Patient,I could draw 20 minutes.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so you could do that too, you know, whatever it is that you can use to kind of. Give yourself that focus time that's what you're trying to do, because you're just trying to figure out now Do I really not like doing those things or do I just really. not want to do those things because i'm not wow. Does that make sense yeah okay. And so I think that even if it's really difficult and it's not something that you want to do, forcing yourself to do some of those things might trigger your brain, you know give that spark of oh yeah this used to be fun. huh but you haven't been able to get there, because you talk yourself out of it before like I don't really want to do this, this doesn't sound fun. So you talk yourself out of it before you even get to that activity this way you do the activity for a select amount of time and then, if it's not what you want to do you want to do something else. So, but you're structuring your day, so you know what to expect you know you know what to expect throughout the day. Until you go to bed at night. And that's going to help you to a remember to take your meds because it's going to be that same time every day, be to remember to eat a meal, you know whether or not it's bag doesn't matter, but at least you're eating because eating is important. And then also trying to. find things that used to give you pleasure in life. and see if you can you know figure out Maybe those don't work anymore, maybe you find something else, but at least giving yourself that ability to explore. um and then what time do you usually eat dinner at night."
5927.0,Patient,Around 530 to six.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so have you can have your dinner at the same time, and make sure you have your dinner. And you only take your meds once a day right. yeah Okay, so the other thing you said that you're struggling with is just your ad hours like taking a shower just those normal everyday things like you just don't want to do them. So maybe you know you schedule yourself at like eight o'clock at night or whatever to take your shower brush your teeth, you know all of those things to wind down before you get ready to go to bed. And then pick another activity, a relaxing activity, because right at that point you're trying to shut everything down you want your brain to slow down, you want you to slow down, you want to be in a peaceful place so you can go to bed. So, the one thing that I like people to do before they go to bed, and that kind of wind down time. is to journal something so if you're having a bunch of racing thoughts and you're feeling manic I want you to journal them. And even if they don't make sense, like maybe you've got 10 different thoughts, none of which connect together and they're just all over the place just write them down on a piece of paper write them in a journal, because once you write them down they come out of your head. I know it sounds weird, but they do once you put them on paper, they come out of your head and it has been a Min it doesn't matter if they make sense they they're just they're gone they're out there on paper."
5927.0,Patient,"they're not emotionally doing that, with this. journal that i'm using right now I charted them doing that work."
480.0,Provider,Is it working for you.
5927.0,Patient,"I forget all the time, Sir, I used to try and make for I did it for like a few days, every day, where I tried to do it multiple times a day, whereas using the journal, and then it went kind of to once a day, and then I went to like once every few days. And now I haven't. really done it in a while, but um. But i'll start doing it again yep."
480.0,Provider,"And you don't need to do it several times a day unless it's something that you want to do so if you are if you're feeling like overwhelmed I was enjoying. yeah So if you if you wait to do that, then that's something that you can do during those kind of set times that you're doing something during the day. But I definitely feel it would be beneficial if you did it before bed, because it just allows you to get all those thoughts out of your head, so that you can slow down and go to bed. Are you able to sleep at night."
5927.0,Patient,"um sometimes. Most of the time, usually yeah I usually can. fall asleep at like. 1230 or whatever and i'll go to sleep. I actually I usually sleep for a really long time okay. um sometimes it's really, really hard to fall asleep um there's some nights where it did I either don't sleep at all, or it takes me to like 3am to fall asleep but usually I can fall asleep really well."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, and that can have something to do with also that imbalance of chemicals in your brain like your serotonin being off those kinds of things so."
5927.0,Patient,Usually sleep late 10 plus hours.
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5927.0,Patient,And I like a hard for me to get up in the morning yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and you also have you know you're also in a state of depression, which is going to make you sleep more or not sleep at all it's going to be two different sides of it."
5927.0,Patient,Especially when you have this is.
480.0,Provider,"A mania so going to bed and getting all your thoughts out it's going to help to hopefully relax you so you can go to sleep and stay asleep throughout the night. But I definitely want you to bring those things up in your next medical appointment, you know that you're having trouble at times sleeping at all, sometimes you don't sleep all night long and then other times you can go to sleep fine, but then you sleep an extended amount of time. You know, because those are all definite signs that you know things aren't local um. And we want to see if those things improve with that consistency and medication. If you have that consistency and medication and things are improving, then you know you know you're going in the right direction, but if you're being consistent with your medication. And things aren't moving in a more positive direction, then you might you know we might need to reassess kind of what that regimen is and that's where. Isaiah comes on because he can really look at that and kind of tweak things to try and get you to you know, being more to be more stable to being more level. So you just have it, so you kind of see how you can just structure your day, and if you consistently follow that structure, you know what to expect, and so does your body. And it's going to feel very robotic at first is you're just going to get up to the same thing over and over, but what you're going to find is that that's going to allow you to feel more at ease because you know what your day looks like, and you know. You know. How life looks and right now, you have this kind of uneasy. in limbo feeling like you just don't know what's going to happen every day, or you know from hour to hour, so now you have more consistency. As far as your your cutting. The next time you want to cut. I want you to either take an ice cube. or. or a rubber band, I want you to do that because it's going to refocus that energy but it's not it's going to cause you to not harm yourself so."
5927.0,Patient,we're basically we're doing.
480.0,Provider,Does that make sense yeah i'm so. Try those things have you tried those in the past i'm on don't know honestly I haven't tried this before.
5927.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,The really the one that I have found has worked really well for people is when they feel very intense emotions. And like they want to cut like you said I just felt so overwhelmed I just needed a cut myself to get that feeling out and go take an ice cube put it in your hand and squeeze it.
5927.0,Patient,And just.
480.0,Provider,"visit tape and it's it's going to be cold and it's going to burn because it's ice and focus on that feeling and you're going to feel the ice cube mouth in your hand. And I want you to use imagery and your brain that that ice cube that's melting, you can feel it dripping away that's all of that overwhelming mania racing thoughts it's all just dripping away as that ice cube is melting from your hand. Okay okay."
5927.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"And then, if you actually have to feel like pain like you need to have that feel of pain to get released that emotional complexities in your brain take a rubber band and snap yourself. Putting on your rest pull it. out and let go and the further you pull it out and let go the more it's going to it's going to have an effect okay okay um I also want you to keep this suicide hotline number with you. And it's 988 all you have to do do is dial 988."
5927.0,Patient,"I can't hear you I was reading your lips, so I got what you said about the Hoffman okay."
480.0,Provider,"So, yes it's. Okay it's nine eight so. I want you to use that because you're going to be alone for the next week, and that is concerning. So you have this hotline you also can call bright heart, if you are really in crisis and you need to request a crisis session, and they will send out a message to all the therapists to see who might be available to have a session with you. Okay. And then also if you are in a really, really terrible place where you are having a plan like an actual plan, this is what i'm going to do i'm going to kill myself tonight, and this is how i'm going to do it, I want you to call braveheart and they want you to tell them. Because we will call 911, we have to, we have to report that it's you know. it's a duty to warn you know that somebody needs to come and do a welfare check on you okay. um. So how are you feeling today are you feeling today like you want to hurt yourself."
5927.0,Patient,"I don't I don't really think so, I mean I kind of woke up and started that call hmm um I don't really have time to myself yeah but. Do you feel yesterday was okay."
480.0,Provider,"All right, do you feel like after having this session that you're in a positive place do you feel like you're still in a dark place or how do you feel."
5927.0,Patient,"yeah um I feel pretty neutral um I have, I have the schedule and stuff and some plans, so I feel good about that."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, good good, and you have the suicide hotline you know that you can get Ahold of them, you know that you can call bright heart. And then don't discount you know, the people in your life that are important that are in your safety plan make your two friends. Whether you just call them on the phone or maybe you can zoom with them. be willing to talk with you."
5927.0,Patient,"And another yeah they were hope um one of my friends Jordan. has had. used to sell farm a lot we sell farm so but um. He had really not wanted me to start doing that, so he for really, really long time i'd never started because of him, and then, when I did whenever I would I would always. Keep it really. I wouldn't go really that far and I, he would help me i'm talk me through it cleaned up and stuff and he would help me not to do it stuff like that."
480.0,Provider,"uh huh so definitely lean on your natural resources. yeah just to recap, right now, you don't have a plan you don't have any intentions you feel like you're in a good place you have all of the information that you need if you get yourself into a dark place of WHO to reach out to. Do you feel like you have a good enough."
5927.0,Patient,I feel okay.
480.0,Provider,I like your safety plan. Okay yeah.
5927.0,Patient,"yeah I feel pretty confident for like the rest of the day um it always just changes really fast like. The day that i'd cut I felt fine the whole day I was watching a movie with my grandpa. And then I came back to the trailer and I just snapped and went downhill instantly I was totally fine and then I got into the and I just snapped instantly I don't know what it was, but um. I just come. It shows just sometimes it happens, like that, so I feel pretty confident for the day today but i'm not sure what it's going to be like later."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so can you make kind of a verbal contract with me that if you get to that place and you feel like you have that instant change, where you feel like you want to cut yourself or hurt yourself that you will contact bret Hart and let them know. yeah Okay, so we have a verbal contract that you're going to do that, and then they will reach out to one of the therapists and it might even be me. To see what the next steps are because the thing that is most important is we want you to be safe, and so, if you if you hit that place, especially since you're going to be alone, the next week, I want you to reach out and that's going to be our verbal contract okay okay yeah."
5927.0,Patient,Right.
480.0,Provider,"Well, I have to let you go because i've got another i've got another client that I have to see, but I will. I will talk to you here in the next couple weeks and like I said reach out if you need to okay. Thank you. All right, take care of yourself."
5927.0,Patient,You to have a nice day.
480.0,Provider,"You too bye bye. As line Klein womack is a medium to high risk for suicide. factors include his racing that mania is also not taking his meds as prescribed we talked about being more consistent to that and structuring his day. So as protective factors include his grandfather and a couple of friends, as well as his cat. His grandfather will be leaving for the week, so he is at higher risk at this point in time, there is no plans were intent on hurting himself. or anybody else he was given the suicide hotline number, and he was also given a safety we went through his safety protocol, he also made a verbal agreement with me that if he had any thoughts of harming himself, he would contact bright heart immediately."
