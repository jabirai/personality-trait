ID,Role,Message
383.0,Provider,I find it find you in a different space. So so interesting and fun and.
6515.0,Patient,Interesting huh in my bedroom.
383.0,Provider,I see I think i've had I think you've been in this room once up. One other time.
6515.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's just because I just arrived from. My. Appointment many pair appointment you usually see you just after group supervision, but today because of it's the holiday."
383.0,Provider,Oh right.
6515.0,Patient,"We didn't have anything in the clinic so I lucked out, I was happy about that because I had class all weekend. So my, although I also short in my Sundays, but my my Saturday it's very heavy it's like. tan tonight. You know what I mean. But i'm not taking the two to five on Sunday classes just attention one but it's true, I had a presentation to like a consultation to do reference case, yesterday I had a homework to do Saturday, so it was just like too much. So this was perfect that today because usually I so busy doing Monday, have a nine to 1030 1030 to 1130 to 12 to one 130 to 330 and it's all related to the clinic you know. That was good. Nice yeah yeah I was thinking that last time I talked to you, I believe I had just come from I walk experience."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, you did describe that to me."
6515.0,Patient,"that's right, I had just come from that. um. yeah and, as I sat here, I was just what am I going to talk about. I did check in on my way. And I don't know what to talk about and that funny."
383.0,Provider,Do you want a little bit of kind of prompting.
6515.0,Patient,"yeah so what what's been on my mind, is just i'm being very in the present. But it's funny, as I said that that was something that came up, to my mind i'm going to share is that okay. Sure um by this exactly October 10 last year was when I got an email from my school for my from the program where I taught inviting me to teach again this brain. And I said yes to me, I think a day or two, but I said yes, but I still remember the feeling I was on the street, when I. Some in line waiting for something when I got that email and and It made me very happy because it was carrying a lot of shame for the what I thought was the work that I did the year prior or in the spring of 2020. And this year I have not been invited to teach, although I. Which is funny because. I don't teach anyway."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"For all sorts of reasons right like it's not financially, I think you probably saw me complaining a lot in the spring, in the spring, was absolutely insane that I did it with the styling practical with a study. and your contract, I was extremely overwhelmed and and with that my family situation is still very much fresh. um but. Thank God, I feel. i'm feeling much better. That little vacation break was perfect."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"um and I don't want to teach also be because you know it's not the. Community mental health is not something that I want to that I, I feel like an imposter teaching coming in a mental health when I have a lot of problems with the field and I haven't necessarily done. As a therapist Community mental health work also um it's not my passion and I feel I need to be talking about the things that I really care about it and passionate about. mm hmm and then on top of that it's very it was very it's very frustrating, and I think i'm complained a lot with you the political climate, that we are in right now."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"So, to have to be in that is very tough with the pronouns and we've all of those feelings so it's just. It was just difficult and. And I felt like I paid to teach and I put into into suffer, you know. But there is a middle very small part of me, that is feeling. The shame. for having. done a horrible job that I feel like was a bad job this past spring, you know, for having just a point in my students, you know my class was wait listed and I feel like I did not, I know, I was not doing a good job at all."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"yeah so that is that and that is something that I cannot really say out there because. You know my boyfriend was already like not understanding why I said yes last year compared considering. Why, he was my experience the year before."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm I don't think it's hard for him to.
6515.0,Patient,"Understand that I would feel. Any upset about being right or not, because it shouldn't even care, I guess. And ultimately, I would not want to do it anyway, but there was that little part of me, that is, like wow you know."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh. Well, the little part of us there that the ego that feels a little bit kind of wounded. That you don't get invited or included or asked, even though you don't want to yourself."
6515.0,Patient,"Right. yeah. it's exactly that. it's so funny you said, did included because I have this friends that I used to hang out hang out a lot in a period of time 2014 you know, a bunch of most of the Brazilians. But there's a you know I feel kind of just forest, but one, Brazilian went to move toward is on I had a baby got married get a baby monitors and the other one was to find that we have parents and either one moved to. la now apparently Austin this jewelry is on, and you know I don't talk much, but here in there, we would send a text on Facebook, or whatever. But, though there are other people in the group but anyway, they hang out, and I see them some data day I saw them two blocks from me. to celebrate a birthday off a guy that isn't the group with them, and I was exactly what I said, like that was just like wow they were so close nobody told me anything but i'm like but. I wouldn't want to ultimately I don't want to be friends with them like that anyway, you know what I mean."
383.0,Provider,You go. yeah.
6515.0,Patient,"And maybe if I had a birthday like I did, five years ago and I invited them, they all came. right but. Things are changed it for me, so much the last five years, that I feel. that's. I feel very much with this lack of Community San Francisco."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, you do. Okay."
6515.0,Patient,Absolutely.
383.0,Provider,"So, if this is in terms of just friendship connections that seems like you have a lot of. You know collegial connections there, or you know you're very involved in your educational courses and."
6515.0,Patient,"yeah. I think. Along the years in San Francisco this has always been a difficulty for the last 14 plus years that i've lived here. I mean a lot of people came and go in and came and left right like they laughed the first couple years when I met a lot of people at work. You know they went to a lot of weddings they got married had kids and moved either to another state, but a lot of out of the city and life is just different I guess."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"um and also, I believe that the bond was not that intense you know strong enough. well received, because so today, this morning I talked to a friend of mine from so cow. That I have kept all these years, and I mean pro-marriage for kids right she has two kids so my so called friends are. The bone get the attachment that we have is much stronger than the that I have ever made with people in San Francisco but he makes any sense, you know, so that our fate, so there were people that came with a laugh and then. I I can think of tribulation free relationships and, specifically, they weren't strong but then we he was there was a rupture. um and then other than that it's been I mean the closest person is this is this immigrant I mean, I do have others but it's not like my friends in southern California it's just hard to explain. You know I have my friend, that it kept with she has two babies, she was my. She was my roommate when I started my Red Square in 2012 um but it's never been we spontaneous like what are you doing let's go for a walk let's do this let's it's never been it's always so what I feel is that here it's always been like we have planned thing. planned to do a catch up and any need for lunch you meet for dinner, and there was a point in my life, I would say six years ago that I kind of got sick of it and I cut out a lot of people because I felt like. He became part of my calendar and then I would see these people ever fi for moms and then we just say like how things have been but I felt the shit hit the fan right like when i'm. struggling those are never the people that I called."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"You know, so I kind of cut a lot of that because it was a distraction from work from from actually studying and and deepening my own growth. So along the years that got better because I had a lot of that I think in my anxiety to create a Community here because feeling. That lack from the so called friends um I try that but it's never been like my friends and so cow. You know where i'm like. Okay, what are you doing no just come over you know i'm about to have dinner or Okay, what do you want to let's go walk and. You know it's never more spontaneity less barriers in spite of all less mental barriers oh my God it's so it's far oh my God it's, on the other side of that you know there's traffic like know people are more. I don't know it's just the friends that I kind of acquire and here it's been like that, so the only friend that it's model little like that is my friend from dela Cruz, who owns a yoga studio."
383.0,Provider,So.
6515.0,Patient,"The last six years she has been somebody who you know I traveled together, I kind of but also even hard, the last year and the last few years. I have put some distance towards it myself, but she came over yesterday with 20 boyfriend we had a good time to see the blue angels might have Barbecue. But my my boyfriend didn't really care if it came up was just for me when I in she tries, you know she had us over for dinner at his house before but that person Donna so i'm like and I try to keep up here and there."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"But it's not the same, you know what I mean."
383.0,Provider,Right right. do feel like you wanted to be different than it is.
6515.0,Patient,With this friend or with my.
383.0,Provider,"General in San Francisco like. because sometimes things are not really how we would it, it may not be your ideal in terms of how it is to communicate socially but it actually works for your life because you're so busy with so many. Things and you know it would be it you just wouldn't really even have the bandwidth to if someone was like hey let's go walking or let's. The more spontaneous you know might not even actually be appropriate to your life, the way it is now."
6515.0,Patient,"Probably probably. It just I feel like right now with the kids with my friends get going up so fast and me missing out on a lot of those things it's sad, you know it's the same difference of course in Brazil. But I think, particularly within ones, and so call it feel that there is more, I think, than the ones in Brazil, there was the we have a history connection and we kept in it's fun. But in everyday. Life, my friends, and still call are kind of more I feel like the attached."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"The point is true. At the same time as I want my life to be a little less. easy and have more time and how. spaciousness. I understand how short and pressures, it is, and I and and how am I living I don't want to be in this like this forever. But here's one thing that I decided today after talking to this friend, because when we went to La I think I told you for tonight's for my friends. My girlfriend's wipes 55th birthday went for two nights and he was so fun, we saw some people we course we couldn't see many people, especially because when I we were in pasadena just for the party. So I told, some of them that I didn't get to see that I was going to try to come for longer than August, because was my school break, but the school break came along, I had a school break for the first time in a year and a half. so busy and tired and there was no way I could plan anything or think of coming down, you know."
383.0,Provider,and
6515.0,Patient,"In we plan to go to sedona he actually even thought about let's go to La get a house and then you can see your friends, but he didn't feel like a real vacation. And even my girlfriend today she's like Oh, he doesn't understand it's a lot of people they needed to see what do you want to see so it's definitely not resting necessarily. By so after talking to her. I decided that I want to try to go there for for a few days in new year's Eve new year's Eve moment because I won't be able to go to Brazil. Because of the visa thing. And we were looking at a place that was warmer than here anyway in San. So we were thinking Miami. But i'm like After talking to her to fit know what maybe we should just we could just go to so Carl because it's going to be warmer than here anyway. And I get to be with my friends that's much more fun than the two of us on."
383.0,Provider,sounds sounds like a solution.
6515.0,Patient,"yeah so to a point yeah So if I could, I guess, if I could make that more happen more, I think that it was. Three years without going to so cow since October, since. Since 2013."
383.0,Provider,With.
6515.0,Patient,"My friends like I haven't been to Brazil, either, so I think going in June made me like oh my God I miss them so much and it's the weather, but if I could definitely spend more time there. You know before I go more often be. tired of the cold weather no we both are."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah.
6515.0,Patient,So we are also looking at that you know.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah San francisco's got a special thing happening, I mean I think it's gotten warmer as the years due to global climate change than it was you know years ago 1020 years ago, I think it was colder than it is now but. it's definitely you know, some people love that and then some people, a lot of people don't you know they don't like it."
6515.0,Patient,I know people love that. I love that and that's why they're here and.
383.0,Provider,yeah.
6515.0,Patient,"This year, specifically like we have not got any day above 72 well not this past weekend the weekend before was the only weekend I think we were like a 6868 I didn't know that it's been rural the whole year."
383.0,Provider,With the cold with kind of the fog and.
6515.0,Patient,"You know. yeah through through April May, June, July."
383.0,Provider,Right right. yeah that that saying you know the coldest winter I ever had was a summer in San Francisco or something like that.
6515.0,Patient,For real that's that's what's been so I felt like there was something in me is getting tired of that you know.
383.0,Provider,"yeah well or people sprinkle sprinkle their time there with visits to you know even going up to sonoma napa you know inland inland to toward. sacramento or you know, to get the warmer weather and the sunshine right or down to southern California. Right yeah. Did you have. Have you given any more thought or I don't know if you want to talk about your you know you're looking toward the future of exploring more. You know, drug therapy with psychedelics and that kind of thing is that something you've been thinking about. Or has that been on the back burner bit."
6515.0,Patient,"So interesting you bring that up. I it's on my list on my to do list for later this month to reach out to one professor, who is part of the sage Institute and they do the associates internship model so it's a Julia program with a curriculum with. requirements, you know we have to do to our I think of intake a week, you need to carry 12 clients, a week. But minimum I guess the top five minimum it's in Berkeley. And I was vv this is, I want to go there, I want me to try to apply to go there."
383.0,Provider,what's the name of the. Stage oh that's right yeah you mentioned that.
6515.0,Patient,"This past week was interesting, so I have a colleague that she's older, also because that's the other part of it, like in my clinic everybody is in their early 30s. I nice but she's in her I believe in the 50s mid 50s she has older kids anyway so she's already associate ship and she also went to this place called. psycho therapies Egypt in Berkeley."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
6515.0,Patient,"They also have they are two year training. Both, which is a lot but um that's all she does right it's just not trying to make my name any anywhere else."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"And so, she started at this fall and she told me, and we had a brief conversation last week we've been trying to talk and her over and over position she said that. The place is kind of a mass the whole diversity and inclusion is very strong she's Korean American but we both opted out, I think I told you back then of the. semester, it was not even I ship, it was something like a group diversity group in our in them in the Marina clinic where we, we are, we opted out, who had a problem with the person that was holding the place. And then we. We went We are doing our thing. So she was telling me that in the places she is the whole diversity thing is mandatory they are doing, like I like ship for white people do this do that and that kind of. cheating i'm going to like see what she says it's like the plate that's kind of a math but the training is good, I, like my supervisor. But she felt like she said well because I told her you know i'm kind of comfortable at the Marina right now. it's very nurturing and very comfortable and she agreed she's like maybe no you don't need to do so much outside we're always doing training this class of that, and what I. mean so maybe you don't need to be putting herself into this whole. whole thing, because it makes sense, the Marina is kind of very cozy very, very it's kind of chill you know what I mean."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"And I will be almost done now, in December, I will be closed the the year, my practical year, so I will not be graduated yet, which is a very strange situation for people there. But so until I get my associate ship number I don't jump into the advanced group, so there is an advanced regiments the group and the domestic group day pay 1200 dollars for the floor and then we take the rest. And I wouldn't be able to do it until probably the fall next year anyway right considering all the timelines but. I will be done with it takes I don't need to be takes anymore, to us, you know I will be kind of the training, although I like to go at 12 o'clock it's not going to be mandatory, but I do like my group supervisors I I love my I, like my interview the Supervisor. It just feels you know they're not upset people message I can you know it's just you kind of do what you want, I, like the freedom. to choose every support but it's there was a little sense of community there. Right like, which is good but that's not like on your face man like you know, things are very. fluid. And I like it. i'm liking it so i'm not i'm not sure if I if it's if I want to put myself through something like that you know i'm i'm considering how could I get the training. Because I know there are other opportunities to get a training it's just that i'm gonna have to pay together training right like. This agency to desert internship model so they're getting people they're offering it for lower income people, but then they are doing the whole internship association people that have to be trained right. So the last you know what I mean."
383.0,Provider,yeah I think i'm getting starting to get lost. In the details so.
6515.0,Patient,"Maybe doesn't matter so to misplace your question I don't know I don't know where I am at right now. i'm, in fact, this is a big. One of the intentions that I had for my I lost the ceremony was to. get clarity on my next steps to feel my next steps, but but i'm not intentional us to release the fear of. Speaking up of. Going back writing online going back up you know talking and I have not done this in years. Because i've been afraid."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"And, and I was you know healing. Focusing on that, but I feel that there is something that is kind of. Closing and opening up at the same time within myself. I really want to resume the book that i've started a book proposal and finish it, I want to you know resume that kind of work. And I feel good I have it. Be being able to so. that clarity is what i'm missing right now, because, as of now, when I get school out of my plate, which is now, I can see the light it's coming."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"um it will free up the space for me to be able to focus on something like getting my. Doing my own, please working on my on my writing working on my writing my own things, maybe do content marketing videos online that kind of thing do my launch my online course that I have created. And if I put myself through. Another training. It will kind of deviate from."
383.0,Provider,"Right so. I mean you can correct me if i'm wrong because I the details are you know hard ones for me to keep track of them all, but you've been through a pretty intensive training process and intermittently you've done some of your own teaching and it's coming to its concluding. The training that you've been at CIS is coming to a conclusion is that correct yeah there's certain things that are coming to conclusion, yes, your proctor come and your see is training."
6515.0,Patient,yeah yeah my practical into the summer mid. April.
383.0,Provider,Okay. and
6515.0,Patient,I graduate in this.
383.0,Provider,screen and you and you graduate. The end of when when is the actual date of the graduation day.
6515.0,Patient,It may it's the.
383.0,Provider,end of day okay.
6515.0,Patient,And I will be doing the whole application to get an associate ship number.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and that is, with an empty."
6515.0,Patient,Right oh it's for the eight empty.
383.0,Provider,um and then do still have many hours to to gather with an empty.
6515.0,Patient,"Well, as any to be out in FT license I need 3000 hours."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and those still need to be you still need to start, you need to start gathering those hours."
6515.0,Patient,So i'm 500 hours now.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Those can be applied to your okay so that's yeah, but you have more to do."
6515.0,Patient,"yeah I. Get 1000 hours, when I started as an emt I believe you know if I go if I want you to this. And then I have 2000 hours to go."
383.0,Provider,Okay um and so embarking on a nother training program you're you're just kind of not quite sure that's you've already been doing so much training. yeah. I could see how you might hesitate to do that.
6515.0,Patient,"Well, I mean why i'm very interested in the psychedelic assisted psychotherapy very, very. I am. Not as passionate about it, thank you because it's good for me to articulate that and I don't think I have said that out loud. I mean i'm a more passionate about women stuff. and I am always see myself frustrated in the spaces, and right now is an example like we have had this guy come for training at the Marina three times and he's amazing he's great and he's hoping is about the clinical relationship. And he's psychodynamic reoriented. So this past week we're talking about rage and rage coming up for the clients reach coming up for us with a client and in many moment that understood the. Gender piece, that is related to how wine expresses rage. Or we press this rage was spoken about that I said cultural piece, there is a gender piece and i'm always the one who has to point out to the nuances of things right, because people just want to go back to Freud and to go back to as it's all there is no difference between the way. both genders are socialized to. develop their relationship with anger."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"um so i'm always the one frustrated for the lack of that and pointing that out. um we just something that I wouldn't have done, had I not gone through what I did when going through the African women's program because he broke up open right so. In 2012 when I was going through the constant psychology program I would just take it all, then, and swallow everything and every looking to the political context of what's being taught and. For better or worse that was what happened with me. going through the women's program and now I can't see it, and I can go back to how it was before and I always frustrated because there was, I mean even yesterday I was looking to do a research for one of my papers and I can't find anything after the 90s. With anger and and feminine psychotherapy because everything is being taken over by when you put gender is gender dysphoria gender you know related to just for your other issues, but not feminist issues."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"i'm def that's definitely and even as i'm speaking here with you like. yeah I feel strongly about that. And, fortunately, the women setup sounds are closed because that definitely would have been a place, I would not think twice about going to."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,"Because of the relational cultural feminist psychotherapy training, well, here we are, and what i'm trying, in fact, so this friend of mine who isn't a cyclic data piece to God in Berkeley she mentioned. In this conversation that we had briefly this week, she also didn't know that and women's therapy Center was closed and she's like I know people went there for training oh my God I didn't know and she bought her. group supervisor had gone there, and she wanted to put me in contact with because i'm thinking that one thing that could support me to is would be to. Get consultation with people that went to to to set up a Center right like people that are familiar with the with the model."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6515.0,Patient,And I think as much as i'm extremely interested in this academic world that's not my work. it's not my soul contract.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, I think."
6515.0,Patient,"i'm i'm curious any trust ego you know i'm a very curious I have so many things that i'm interested in, but if you ask me like am I going to be. If it's about research like no it's definitely not the thing for me. Thank you."
383.0,Provider,"This was helpful, so I think yeah you've kind of gone around and wound around and you're kind of coming back to that you know your real passion is about women's issues, and you know that that's going to maybe be more of your emphasis, then the psychedelic assisted. psychotherapy. That you're it's not that you're not you know you might not go to workshops about psychedelic assisted therapy and or maybe even dive a little deeper, but your your want to go more into to open your voice to. Speaking about women's issues and supporting women and focusing on that, which I think is great, and I think there's so much room for it and space for that in this world. You know."
6515.0,Patient,yeah army. I feel there's a need.
383.0,Provider,There is a need.
6515.0,Patient,"In that is. yeah that is definitely what I want to be talking about that's definitely been less will be tried see. Everything and and in and on so many levels, that is what has liberated me. So I want to offer the same."
383.0,Provider,"yeah so you've you've already i'm sure. You put in so much work in that area, you know your. thought processes your you know just your attention and so that's kind of like a wellspring of that you have that's already there you know it's it's great to. being interested in many things, but if we have like a wellspring of already cultivated knowledge and. Engagement than. That it's good to tap into that because it's like it's your passion and if you've already spent a lot of you know, good amount of time in that area and and can articulate about it, you know. With with ease and so it's good to keep on keep on moving in that direction of something you've already developed and cultivated."
6515.0,Patient,"yeah. Exactly, and I find that the Marina is a place that can give me room. To do that, because it's really not too demanding. You know. And it's nurturing I feel nurtured and it's not too demanding and and i'm thinking you know I saw the curriculum for the psychedelic for the stage Institute and it does look good. And i'm. i'm interested in all those topics, but I also can already as i'm speaking to you will be it feels like will be a repetition of me they're feeling frustrated because gender is again invisible."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6515.0,Patient,"Young and archetypes and this and that right like okay all great on awesome but. Not for the women's lenses and which is what I want, so I would rather use that time to do my own research on them in psychotherapy stuff connect with people. In fact, as you're talking here there is this person this woman was from San Jose I don't know how to connect with her, but she's a teacher and she. She wrote an article recently, and I think it's titled there's something like the write up the article that I didn't want to have to write or the article that I didn't want to write she wrote this book here. That i'm got like a few months ago. And so, she is also second wave old school."
