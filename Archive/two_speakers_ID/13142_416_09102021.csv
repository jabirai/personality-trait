And then the owner, he was supposed to main guy who's doing the roof, with the expertise he's an alcoholic and he show up when he want to and he just didn't work the job at all, and that was getting on my nerves, because it was expensive route. And so, today, you know I had asked test, I was like you know he came over to get, as I said, yeah you're here you weren't here when the inspector was here, I was pissed at the inspector because he didn't get his ass up on the roof and check everything.

13142.0,Patient,"distraction like think about shit like this brings up a lot of things from my past, you know when you get angry like that. I don't know, sometimes I know what it's connected to Julia it's connected to billing. used all the time, my job by my family, you know because I I was the youngest kid out of four.

He committed suicide, the day my my youngest grandson was born that was September 5. Day, he was being born, I found out that he had murdered hung himself in the park. Today is his birthday. And so, and he screwed me over and i'm so angry with him. and You know i've been trying to learn to let go of all my anger toward my family. And it's been very. You know it's just hard."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13142.0,Patient,"They were really not nice to me. They used me to the point where. i'll be really honest I don't even think they really. They really even saw me is their sister, but more as their as like a slave to be honest yeah."
416.0,Provider,How are you what what kinds of things are you trying to be able to let go of that anger.
13142.0,Patient,To try to look and see what they were dealing last. Or how they were raised. You know.
416.0,Provider,So finding finding that empathy and understanding.
13142.0,Patient,"But it's really hard because they still Act, the way they act. Like my oldest brother is still an asshole and you know the the things he said about certain things that happened."
416.0,Provider,unforgivable.
13142.0,Patient,"yeah and then he sealed treats me like i'm a kid. Actually, like i'm 11 or 12 years old, he still talks to me that way when we're around. The like i'm done."
416.0,Provider,I thought you didn't have any contact with them.
13142.0,Patient,I don't when I have had contact.
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah okay.
13142.0,Patient,"i'm just like. You know you're an asshole your real asshole. You don't even fucking know me you didn't take care of me you abandoned me as a child never stood up as a Big Brother yeah you may have come find me when I was up in the streets and brought me home but that's about it, I wouldn't give Fuck up dinner did. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Well, you know, like letting working on letting go of some of that anger it. It isn't for them right it's for you. it's so you don't have to carry it around."
13142.0,Patient,"Right and but you know there's a party, where you want them to know what they did. And that's what what fucking is eating me up. Julie i'm sorry i'm custom so much."
416.0,Provider,hidden costs as much as you want I don't care. You and.
13142.0,Patient,"that's the bugs me is not as they come up to me, you know, on Facebook right they'll say something like our mom was so nice and Stephen. My mom was at I, and I like today, they put something on there, it says would use my sister in law put up this things that would you slap your mother for $10 million. And I said, paying me. Was not nice to me."
416.0,Provider,i'm pretty sure my mother would let me slap her for $10 million. she'd be like go ahead slap me let's split it.
13142.0,Patient,"You know I wrote that down there and I was like and she wrote something like me and I was like I ignored it I say don't even go there with me, you know."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13142.0,Patient,"My mom was she was she is a batch she looked so innocent and sweet because she was small and little people thought she was just you know people assume, by the way people look that there are certain way. But my mother diabolical mentally she could Fuck you're."
416.0,Provider,Going back to the your connection to the to your siblings though um it just strikes me that it's going to be pretty difficult for you to. to let go of that anger if you're still connected to them through social media and they're still saying things that make you angry.
13142.0,Patient,"I know that's why, but a big part of me is just wants to write a letter just letting it all out."
416.0,Provider,I got a great idea.
13142.0,Patient,"You know, and just telling them everything i'm letting it go for that way. You know just putting it all out i've one or two ways I could do it that way or or. When I. leave a video. You know, like me and my sister I let my sister see I forgive my sister. Because me and my sister realized something together, knowing thing my mother gave us is when she would die she was no more in our lives to tear us apart. You know she kept us not being able to be together, and then we were able to talk and see how she manipulated us and kept us apart. My mother when she died, we were able to really be sisters again and to forgive each other to understand why we did what we did she would put us together like dogs. You know, against each other. and We love each other, where our love is so strong now you know."
416.0,Provider,That pairing that. You take so maybe. Maybe there's an opportunity there with some of your other sibling.
13142.0,Patient,"know but see that's the problem my brother blessed that what we call. The Prince. hmm and my mother did everything for him, she go against my father. She would do. Go behind my dad back everything from my brother he could not all he thinks she regret is that she couldn't give them more. And so, he looks at my mother no you don't know what mom went doing needed that I said, can we all know what mom wants to, but you that doesn't give her right do what she did to us. You know, you can."
416.0,Provider,"he sees it really differently, because he was treated differently."
13142.0,Patient,"Why, he was treated he got everything we got nothing she told us things my mother told me. When I was young, I had my girlfriend."
416.0,Provider,I just lost you. you're muted.
13142.0,Patient,"I have my girlfriend come over. My mother she's Japanese and the time. And my mother looked at her and said. She came over and she says you're doing Nice and pretty girl, why are you with my daughter she's bad. i'm standing there. My girlfriend is looking at me he goes you don't need to be with around her you shouldn't shouldn't be your friend. she's not a good person she's not gonna go anywhere. You know I thought her. My girlfriend looked at me she was cheating I don't know what to say I said come on let's just go and I left off the door see The thing is, I never cussed my mother out, I never disrespected her, I never hit her. I would never say nothing back to her. Okay. and I did that so badly that when I was 17 I had severe bleeding ulcers. I have everything in. And then."
416.0,Provider,that's why john comes out right steps and because you're not you having trouble with it.
13142.0,Patient,"No, but it was weird like with my parents. I would take beatings from my father, my father would pick up anything and back then vacuum cleaner hoses weren't plastic they wouldn't matter. I mean irons and. shit like that you know. and never said a friggin word. and It was weird back then I just would never say anything to. My parents. always give them respect and. The only reason my father stop hitting me is because one day I just told him I said, you know what i'm tired of this go get your fucking rifle and blow my brains out because i'm not gonna let you do this, no more. So you have a choice you can either blow my fucking brains out or I can kill you."
416.0,Provider,So.
13142.0,Patient,You want to do. But you're not going to raise your hand to me one more time.
416.0,Provider,And was that. Was that 20 talking her was that john.
13142.0,Patient,I think that was kind of all of us. You know and.
416.0,Provider,You were just all done with it now.
13142.0,Patient,"yeah and he never raised his hand to me again. and, later on, he apologized. You know, see that's The thing is me and my father made up he sat down and he says, I did you wrong I abused you physically, you know."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13142.0,Patient,"i'm sorry I was an alcoholic I wasn't this and I will try to make up for what I did wrong, even though I will never make up to you. But I will always be there and be the respectful father, you know. From that moment on, he was. We were able to build a relationship."
416.0,Provider,yeah. So you're still working on that.
13142.0,Patient,"You know, he passed on, and it was sad because we were when I needed him most. He hand up dying and then my mom she was never my mother never said start for whatever she did she just always had excuses for what she did you know. And she always made me feel like you're kind of not worth it. She always said things in a way, like. you're never good enough for you're never worth anything you know. Like you have your mother child you, you know, are you can do is made for Kenny and make a little money you you don't have to be married you're just gonna live with me. You can live with me and arm you bring me your check i'll give you $20 a week for cigarettes and stuff. You know, you can live with me and your dad. and have a little job you know you'd be a housekeeper something. This one my mother, said to me."
416.0,Provider,offer.
13142.0,Patient,"You know she always ever since I was a child, kept me like I was stupid."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13142.0,Patient,You know because I was the real quiet one. And I never 70 and I always stay by myself. and
416.0,Provider,say you never got that nurture that love that you deserved.
13142.0,Patient,"Right my mother never nurtured me and then so. My father and my father said what the hell, are you telling her. You know they gotten a big fight, you know and that's the one time, my father said you're one mean stupid. He goes this girl has taken care of this family to take care of your children and you ain't get shipped for your kid. He goes I don't believe that came out of your mouth, he said, you know my dad's differences Kenny, if you want to fly to the goddamn and you can go to the moon, you can do anything you wanted to. Because you're smart you know the real deal, you know he looked at my mommy says, if it wasn't for her we wouldn't have this fucking house right now. she's cooking she's paid the mortgage on this batch. And you're telling her be a housekeeper. You don't even know how much your daughter makes. You know."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13142.0,Patient,"So you know I grew up, and it was really weird I fought so hard Julie, to have my mother's love."
416.0,Provider,I mean. He didn't have it to give she just didn't have it together.
13142.0,Patient,I really for years just wanted just to her for her to say you know when I graduated when I got my key did when I got this or that she. Not one did she come to any of my program in my poetry reading through my art art things nothing. Now I want. You know.
416.0,Provider,She just she just couldn't handle around stuff and didn't have anything to give you.
13142.0,Patient,"One day, I told her I said mom you really don't like me. And I said that's fine because you know what i've learned over the years I don't like and I don't want to be somebody like you. I really don't want you."
416.0,Provider,I want you to learn how to be. You learned how to be the mother that you want it to be.
13142.0,Patient,yeah and the thing is it's just like I end up mothering too much you know what I mean.
416.0,Provider,You kind of went a little fire in the other direction.
13142.0,Patient,"Why you go from one extreme to the next kind of taking care of everybody and it's just like you know. I think that's why I don't initiate friendships too much. You know, because you know how people you gotta make friendships grow."
416.0,Provider,yep. And that they take time and effort.
13142.0,Patient,"I have real close friends, but it's weird how relationships are. They know they don't have to talk to me. They don't have to talk to me for years. And they know they can call me and it's like right back the same and if they need anything i'm there."
416.0,Provider,I mean that's that's my friendships really about right.
13142.0,Patient,"yeah and, like, I have one really close girlfriend who's been with me throughout the years because she's my sister in law or not just kind of my sister in law, but she was married to my boyfriend's. brother. And we're really."
416.0,Provider,And you mentioned her before.
13142.0,Patient,"lean and we're so ty like when she had her heart attack and needed a triple bypass I was gone on the next plane headed to Pittsburgh. You know she means everything to me and she's older than me she's 72 she's like 12 years old, and they were like super tight and I love her to death and. she's put it this way she's kept my heart tender. You know or."
416.0,Provider,i'm glad to have her.
13142.0,Patient,yeah i'm so glad Julie she's the one that I have friends that I what I call my friends that keep keep me from going to the other side.
416.0,Provider,"Well, and a lot of ways, you know when we don't get the parenting that we need as a child, you know we end up with our chosen family right we end up with people like like her, who can. People like her, who can kind of not be our mother, but like provide us with that nurture that we never got and the kindness that we never got and sort of. That universal acceptance."
13142.0,Patient,"And thing is, they can show us how to be. kindness you do pay. To keep our kindness because pain sort of. being hurt or being abandoned yeah we see what people don't get is when you're a band and. You were told abandoned is like being a piece of garbage and thrown away. And that's what I kind of. abandoned doesn't work that word kinda. Because it doesn't say. It doesn't give the feeling of what it does abandonment is devastation. When you are banded you work, it means you are told you are not worth anything."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah I mean there's actual like there's changes that happen in your brain when that happens.
13142.0,Patient,yeah I have been abandoned so many times in my life.
416.0,Provider,"it's hard to make connections, but it's pretty amazing."
13142.0,Patient,You know.
416.0,Provider,"You actually have been able to make some really solid connections how. Solid connections, given that."
13142.0,Patient,"And then the thing is to. You know, like I tell anybody. into a kid. I said, if you do it, you could be the. one."
416.0,Provider,Can yeah.
13142.0,Patient,"You know and. Look at me and say. No, because as long as you may be being that child that child thinks Oh, you can change."
416.0,Provider,yeah that's right.
13142.0,Patient,they're not anything.
416.0,Provider,You are correct. and turning I am so sorry to cut this short I just realized that I actually have. Another I have a somebody buzzing me about an emergency.
