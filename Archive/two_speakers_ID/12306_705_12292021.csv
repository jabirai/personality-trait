Really really relax and I was like either one like I did something completely out of the ordinary to. go into like a crowd like 20,000 people by myself. And, just like you know what like I enjoyed myself, I had a good time happy."
705.0,Provider,"that's a big accomplishment and so you did it and what a healthy way, then, by getting excited being part of, and then you had a good night rest."

12306.0,Patient,yeah it really just threw myself into the fire that way.
705.0,Provider,"Right, but you did terrific and you know, having that belief in yourself."
12306.0,Patient,"yeah like I didn't really think about it, like I. was just taking the moment like I didn't realize like there's like a bunch of strangers around me just kind of like. I was there by myself, I don't have an issue with that. I think that's the first time and. age is probably error that like I did something this big by myself and easy on like like friends or sister like family, but like know what would treat myself today, nobody else wants to go, I still want to go, so I went."
705.0,Provider,"And not letting that stop you. wow I am just smiling because i'm thinking to that what growth, where you've become so comfortable within yourself. It doesn't matter if other people aren't available and that you don't know anybody else."
12306.0,Patient,it's crazy to think of like it just makes me smile like I I did something. But I thought I never would be we did add. know and they're like you know what I can do things on my own still have fun.
705.0,Provider,And that practicing self love that has so many different you know of how you practice self love.
12306.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. Just like. Well, you know somebody else, like me, I think I will probably bought like a little higher seats are like a little cheaper, but since I went by myself, I was like you know what can buy some tickets, a little bit closer to the floor because, why not, I can't."
705.0,Provider,"And that you, you made it into a great experience for yourself and that you took that healthy risk. To try something new."
12306.0,Patient,And yeah.
705.0,Provider,You liked it.
12306.0,Patient,Oh yeah it was great. Both we can't wait to do again.
705.0,Provider,"Again, I was saying that bring you joy you're tapping in on that now. Instead of focusing on before the Managing now you have the Managing now it's just like give me more. yeah yeah."
12306.0,Patient,"For me, like what's the like for a second half, and like. Like I get like anxious and i'm like yeah well like maybe i'll sit somewhere else, like we're a little bit where it's a little bit less crowded like I wouldn't leave but probably. move somewhere else, where it's like all right let's a little bit more pain down here, but I just stayed in my seat, I was a middle of like the section sounds like to my left there's 10 people to my right there's 10 people, as I was, like i'm smack DAB in the middle of this a. bunch of strangers. I stayed there the entire time."
705.0,Provider,What do you learn about yourself.
12306.0,Patient,"I mean just kind of that I can do this for myself and so like. Like I didn't have to like I pushed myself to get there, but at the same time, I was like I just find it enjoyable like I didn't freak out, I was like you know what. This feels okay this feels right. I don't feel like i'm out of place or anything like the House, I feel let them fit in right."
705.0,Provider,If you weren't a showman and you know people with anxiety that this was one of your you know that you had this as a goal and that to go out put yourself in the middle of the section and you set it up like that just how you experienced it a. lot of people wouldn't be able to do what you did.
12306.0,Patient,"I never thought I could do it either. They, after I can't believe I did it i'm happy I did. kind of incredible. Well, I really put into perspective."
705.0,Provider,"Very freaking incredible. it's harnessing to where it's like with anxiety with depression as you're being able to be like you know what now i'm not taking a backseat i'm the one driving and i'm making the changes and you do that. If this sets the stage. For okay Now you can do, where the Foundation is there you've already accomplished like 20,000 people in the middle of somewhere. All of these other things like what brings you joy, like some of even the smaller action steps is there anything that you're starting to be like you know what maybe I need a little bit more of this as a hobby or something of interest."
12306.0,Patient,"Really. Nothing really stands out the moment because they. Like to go watch myself I think walking by myself, was never like. A more express where he situation, just because I. keep my headphones on I just kind of keep walking probably probably just kind of like. going out for dinner just by myself, it was like when I think again it's like couples and things like that you know what. I don't feel like they needed somebody for dinner."
705.0,Provider,yeah and you know I think something like that that is need it takes you out of your House it again get you where you have opportunities to socialize.
12306.0,Patient,"yeah. So. back when I don't know that intimidates me just a little bit more honestly I don't know why. It is, I feel like it's more for like intimate like paying. Something like that it's going to be a little bit more, how would say hey. I think I can do it, but i'm going to take some baby steps to get there."
705.0,Provider,"i'm part of steps to is taking a look at like, especially for your first place that maybe you go where, would you be more comfortable then."
12306.0,Patient,"Probably someone like outdoor locations like near where I live, you. Probably like sometime in the afternoon and like nothing yet like not a nighttime yet. Right like we can our third location. For like two or three. would probably be like kind of starting point is like you know what they get outdoors a little bit more spacious it feels more spaces, at least, though right first off or something like that."
705.0,Provider,"that's a great great goal, and I think again it's putting to what your comfort zone is and that that time of day, sitting outside I mean just sitting out sound I outside sounds also just very you know getting in touch with nature and bringing that into the experience."
12306.0,Patient,yeah because there's like some places near my house like they have outdoor seating i'm like you know what I could start off there. Like nothing to be like still outdoors like eating establishment.
705.0,Provider,And when you walk by have you noticed that people are there by themselves.
12306.0,Patient,Now.
705.0,Provider,I really. want five people are always like having coffee or something especially outside.
12306.0,Patient,"knows a lot, a lot of like kind of like groups of people like rarely like do I see like individuals by themselves. yeah. i'm. Sorry."
705.0,Provider,"To say maybe break that. break that that cycle, where then someone sees you and they're like oh."
12306.0,Patient,"yeah, we have to do it first."
705.0,Provider,True true i'm sorry Martin what were you gonna say before.
12306.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I probably would do it right now, just because, like the weather's it's a little bit radio, so I probably won't want to sit outside in the rain right now."
705.0,Provider,You have your limits.
12306.0,Patient,"I don't like eating the rain that's probably my limit, I would say."
705.0,Provider,Like I know what I do and don't like and so yeah.
12306.0,Patient,"I love the rain, but I don't really want half a mule be wet. saturated exactly."
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah it is it's it's different that we you know because I live in southern California, I think you live more up north. And it's been raining out on and off."
12306.0,Patient,"It has been kind of weird because, like. Like it rains around this time, but that, like this level a little. bit different."
705.0,Provider,"i'm used to like maybe one time, a week at most in the winter and we've had two or three times this week already."
12306.0,Patient,saved here it's a strange time pretty.
705.0,Provider,"Ah, do you like i've been talking to different people, and some people love the way it smells afterwards, with a good rain any of your senses, like the ring."
12306.0,Patient,"Oh, I love the right yeah you kind of like it's relaxing honestly like like hearing it definitely like relaxes. Like I like the way it feels kind of like once falling down on me it's just kind of like. thing walking home from work, one day, and it goes like those party right now, I think you know i'm just gonna slay right on me and I enjoyed it."
705.0,Provider,yeah wow so you just let the rain come down in was just absorbed in that experience.
12306.0,Patient,"These that yeah pretty much. I like it, I, like the way it was like the way it felt."
705.0,Provider,Allowing yourself to to try something different.
12306.0,Patient,"yeah. Like. We just feel good, I have no other words, besides like it's a good feeling glad I like there's like no one's gonna enjoy the rain."
705.0,Provider,"i'm hearing a lot of to that you're being spontaneous where it's not you don't have to have everything pre planned out you're just being spontaneous and going with that too, if the if the mood issue."
12306.0,Patient,"yeah pretty much. bring it back just a little bit tired what the game, I went to last night for warriors game. I started to go like an hour and a half before the game started. was like kind of like I like I like that, because I guess, he says, their friends like beforehand, again, you would want to go and they're like no because that sounds like okay I won't go there by myself, then like an hour and a half before the game started like know what. gonna go."
705.0,Provider,we're in Houston was certainly pregame stuff going on.
12306.0,Patient,"I missed some of it yeah but like I got like Ryan time, like the game to start because I like 20 minutes away from the arena. was like you know i'm gonna take a shower they go."
705.0,Provider,"huh. It has the benefits of getting yourself out of the House, do you feel the anxiety has decreased."
12306.0,Patient,"How it's a yes, no so yeah. i'm not scared to. Say no alone. Maybe like where. it's like you know I think i'm going to work on myself that people see me alone, all the time, like it's not the same thing, but, though I like alone time when i'm like going out to work, so. The next I guess job was a big one, to go to the event that myself but. what's the difference between beer work alone on like directly with strangers to be like in a sporting event with like a bunch of strangers."
705.0,Provider,And having that mindset that it doesn't have to be different it's what you're making it and what you're experiencing.
12306.0,Patient,"yeah. it's a look like I would see like well think about it like this somewhat like connections between the two of them like I see there's like their differences only. To like the similar for each other, some. aspects are to say."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's at the game, too, is you put yourself out there, and you were able to get the response back. That others were you know it was inviting it was a good experience by by you had you not put yourself in that situation is what i'm saying you wouldn't have had that experience, but neither would the people that were sitting there they probably had a better experience to."
12306.0,Patient,"I will hope so, as well, I believe, like just being around them this kind of like it definitely felt like the work experience, I would say as well, like it was definitely chemo. I wasn't being looked at definitely know that i'm just like you. were watching the game you're watching the game we're all watching the game. Just have fun, you know it took a little bit for people to get like into it, but."
705.0,Provider,"As and it's it's learning what gives you like energy you're at something like that, and it sounds like you had a lot of energy from it it's balancing where you know, do you think if you did that every day, do you need as much energy, you know, do you need that every day."
12306.0,Patient,"Probably. I would probably be like it would be nice to have like somewhat less energy, but like a little bit little bit tired, he was just like constantly. way, a lot of exerting a lot of energy, it can be tiring like every other day would be nice for the carrier like it would just be nice to have like a snippet of that like feeling every day."
705.0,Provider,yeah I was just gonna say how would you get that feeling.
12306.0,Patient,"it's kind of like. Putting myself out there, a little bit more, because I good strangers, and just kind of like. kind of going about it every single day just kind of. enjoying it just kind of really. not be worried about like sorry around with vacations of like. Well, they don't want to talk that's fine i'm just gonna leave it alone like I think they don't want to talk, but things like that."
705.0,Provider,And it is creating that then each day telling the stranger hi if they if they don't respond back that's on them.
12306.0,Patient,"yeah. There are moments like what i'm like the way to work, our way back home like no i'm like oh like your shoes, or like your sweater stuff like that women. Sometimes, like I haven't had a great conversations like I have any opportunities to do like their momentum like I said it well, I got."
705.0,Provider,"nothing to lose and, on that day, maybe someone needed a pick me up are needed to engage with someone just to know someone else's paying attention."
12306.0,Patient,and help someone say out a little bit.
705.0,Provider,"The way that we engage with with one another and just being able to acknowledge, I feel, your presence, I see your presence, you are here. Oh. Now that getting used to to finding what that balances, as if he did the 20,000 people every day is that too much of the energy being expanded that way, do you need like some alone time to to balance it out."
12306.0,Patient,"I think so. Why it's great having all that energy like being there like I love it I love that yesterday was like holy moly this is if it wasn't easy. But the other way as a healer I need to take a nap. So, like you know. I can probably. Do like. Like pretty frequently like even though yesterday was the first time, like you know, like. Right now we are, but the same time, when you don't know which one is bigger than what. I just want to be alone I just like kind of just be mellow and. relax pretty much."
705.0,Provider,"recharges in a different way, when you relax what is that recharging yeah."
12306.0,Patient,"it's like. Like mental point kind of stability in a way, like you know, like I just like jarring like my head or replace can like which is like in my own space kind of like tell of rebooting everything like. Like emotionally things like that, because, like. I just kind of want to be alone and just. kind of. Be to myself and just think about what's going on. So relax."
705.0,Provider,"Ah, and finding that about yourself that self discovery and also some people need the 24 seven there on high alert they like the excitement and that recharges them that's the energy they need and others, it just depletes."
12306.0,Patient,yeah. yeah I feel like i'm one of those people who would like me like a day or two other week just kind of like. yeah so.
705.0,Provider,"enjoying like I know for myself, I need sometimes that solitude also I can go to what you're talking about where you go to something big but I don't want that all the time, I need to find my rest, up to and just some downtime."
12306.0,Patient,yeah definitely definitely well a little breaks in between.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Over the holidays, so do I have an opportunity to spend some time with family."
12306.0,Patient,"I did yeah pretty much Christmas and. New years prior to coming here and. This. just talking about right yes just be here with them it's kind of. Because enjoying their time with each other. Without much so, I would say so we're just all here together. Just enjoying it."
705.0,Provider,More of enjoying one another's company and know like family dynamics that. Are off.
12306.0,Patient,"Let me know which i'm happy about. yeah. well. I don't know it felt very mellow this year. Like for like my dad's passing like the 23rd of December, like we're all. fairly mellow about it, like, I have to work that day, so it could visit to the cemetery but my sister date and spend some time with her day. not too sure all my mom did but. And i'd rather brother. he's a girlfriend so I don't know. But so pretty good time."
705.0,Provider,With it on the anniversary to your dad's passing was work helpful for you to be engaged with work.
12306.0,Patient,"It was honestly kind of players those remember my dad but the same time, I was just like you know, like. I know you weren't want me to be sad like he would want me to be like you know, like you're living your life you continue to do what you need to do like. You okay okay."
705.0,Provider,And I. Think of to just living in those moments where your dad would be very happy for you to you know. seeing you in the crowd of people yelling and cheering them on.
12306.0,Patient,"yeah like. He was the biggest event person Tyler Thank you didn't like that he will get to take baseball games, because he uses baseball fans but Besides that, like us very big whole body so. him probably see me do that would be like whoa. there's a saying right there."
705.0,Provider,"And and dad gets it then dad would get it, that that that's a huge accomplishment for you and where you feel so comfortable within yourself that you could pull that off."
12306.0,Patient,"yeah mama surprise herself she say Oh, you know this is like we go with i'm like let's say okay. Because it's always like Oh, who are you going to go away that's always the thing. Nobody me he's like okay we'll just stay safe. yeah."

705.0,Provider,Is that two years than more like an externship or an intern site.
12306.0,Patient,"I guess the best I say I think it's just like an external Program. Because it's. Like its associated with like college or like a college, but they're more like just focused on like teaching you like every single detail, but like working with like the equipment and like medical terminology and things like that, like it's more just like focused on like radiology. But there's no like outside like. Other subjects like English because three states purely focused on. dni radiology."
705.0,Provider,Any requirements for like a certain amount of hours that you need under your belt like do you have to go before board and take a test or.
12306.0,Patient,"yeah pretty much at the end of like the program there's the exam is called, but you have to take like the exam to be certified. To be a radiologist that's like at the end of the Program. Looking forward to that."

12306.0,Patient,"Oh. Maybe out of those though you're on the fence about that. and I will be on the after our last session I did message for X ever have attorneys can remember, like a little after a session. I don't want to read into it too much, but we will like iPhone so you can turn on or turn off like like when you wrote a message always it was always off before, but she turned it on for the last message I said I like what. You should never apply a third method I sounds like being like hey how you doing, I think the only. sounds kind of like he door reading too much into that situation, basically just take a little bit ahead."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I know. That let's say if she's not in the place to keep continue, you know she doesn't have right now she's not in that space to open that door. Is it better for you, though, Martin, to know that and to be like okay Now I know that, but I can maybe open the door in the future, was was someone different."
12306.0,Patient,"I think yeah. I don't want to admit that English because, like it wouldn't be fair if I want to be another relationship with another personally to be like so clicking on. To have a. So. I want to say yes, but at the same time i'm just like I would feel terrible if I were to get something different, again, you really should because it's where be fair to the personal data."
705.0,Provider,So you consider that right now that you are dating or you're not dating with.

12306.0,Patient,"don't know what that will be hopefully it's sooner rather than later. hey. can control so many things like this one, but still tell us like. feels like it's out of my hand."
705.0,Provider,"At hard to it's hard you know with our minds, we can think a certain way, but the affairs of the heart is much more complicated and more complex that we give credit to."
12306.0,Patient,That yeah. mentally I can say when i'm done like moving on. A hard to say no to that.
705.0,Provider,What i'm hearing the lightness that you were vulnerable and that you took a healthy risk and and you reached out.
12306.0,Patient,well.
705.0,Provider,"You know you, you did that."
12306.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,And that's that vulnerability is sometimes it's reaching out and taking that risk and not knowing how it's going to turn out like we don't know the outcome of it and that's in an essence can be the vulnerability part.
12306.0,Patient,yeah it. wasn't The end result would avoid it but can't always get what you want.
705.0,Provider,"And couldn't even be something different, like you said, maybe you're reading it a certain way and she's reading in a certain way, or maybe there's other things that have come up."
12306.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"For yourself, though, you made the move and and you did it."
12306.0,Patient,"Do you. Have any regrets about it. put myself out there, like I. Essentially, put my hand out there yeah it's kind of like. I guess there's things a little bit definitely things but yeah."
705.0,Provider,"It can sting and that can that can last for a while and then you start to see once it dissipates and like today. When you talked about having no regrets, I saw smile that even though it's painful and you're going through it, that it's also a relief that you did put yourself out there and that you don't have regrets like I should have done this, I should have you know reached out you did."
12306.0,Patient,"yeah. they'll see the good like. i'm glad I. Did it. kind of really have any words, for you know, like we don't have those feelings of like shoot sure like I have messaged her like this and mailing them I did him. there's nothing to be ashamed about feeling that."
705.0,Provider,"You to control, you know when we talk about the things we have control and the things we don't have control over is you took control over what your ability was was to reach out. And, and you did it and that's part of the healing stages and who knows, Martin maybe this is something that it may may turn out a different way than maybe you anticipate it and it was. Maybe, even better, it was you know this, this whole plan someone shuffled the papers and all the papers got out of order."
12306.0,Patient,yeah. Different. Ways it can go and not just once that way.
705.0,Provider,social needs you're from what you're telling me is your social needs are still being met by going to these games interacting being around people and could it be right now that's what you need you're not wanting to be in a relationship and things like that. This other social aspect is is what what's for right now just enough for where you are.
12306.0,Patient,"Thank you might be right. I think so. yeah like. feels like it really shifts like you don't have to constantly be on a person like oh you do like that's the kind of relationships i'm like I don't want like I want to have a freedom. Like like playing vice versa, like i'm the person i'm with their own freedom so like you know, right now, just like. I can literally. Go out by myself talk to random people in that be like whoa like am I supposed to be doing something with this, I reverse and we're like no like. enjoying my wife is in showing what i'm doing. Like I guess fears I guess of like oh like is this very good megan i'm a. person with like upset because i'm not like swift or doing something i'm not supposed to or things like that. Like. If I want to go out. Fine, I don't have to like responses that."
705.0,Provider,"They took taken advantage, you know taken advantage of the opportunity, why you're why you're single you talk about regrets then there's you've you've done these kind of things that you want it, you know the self discoveries and putting yourself out there. And the event that maybe you settle down later on when you choose to be you've taken advantage of the opportunity to be yourself and to be out there, independent."
12306.0,Patient,"Welcome, let these moments slip away either."
705.0,Provider,Ah. That luxury to that you described like after the game it didn't matter what you did you just decided for yourself that and I think I want to go to the store now. to consult with anybody didn't have to you know reach out.

705.0,Provider,"So soak it all in you might be in a couple of years, also busy and working in your field and doing all this and that we're right now you're just taking any today."
12306.0,Patient,"yeah. never really looked at it from that perspective, like things can change. You know, not many people can do these things as well, like black people are like super hectic and busy like have a lot of things going on, you know, like like i'm fairly busy as well you're still able to have these moments in time so i'm just like you know what. enjoy it. and have fun. Taking advantage of those times."

And the energy you felt was because of what you put out there."
12306.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"it's that healthy risk sometimes the with your ex you you put yourself out there, you might have not gotten what you expected you wish for something different, but this other you still put yourself out there, and you had a different outcome because of it."
12306.0,Patient,"can win them all, you. Know like. I think I have a tendency of like dragging in the negative like things and like pushing away the positives but. like this time around like. Obviously, so sad little things like that can text back response, but I didn't let it. hit as hard as I thought it would have had before. Like really embracing yesterday love more than before."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, it is and it's taken a lot of hard work and dedication on your part, to make these significant changes that are you know again about yourself discoveries about being you are embracing it all."
