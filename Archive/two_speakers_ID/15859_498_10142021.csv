498.0,Provider,"Okay, I was about to ask you, are you just filling a trembling tremors here, or is it generalized or describe that and better detail."
15859.0,Patient,"So when I feel it on my left and if I get up and start walking around I feel like my whole body kind of starts doing that. Once i'm walking for a little while and or I sit down, it kind of like slows down or like gets better okay."

15859.0,Patient,um. So i've been putting like heating pads thinking you know it actually feels good when I put heating pads but. It has gotten a little bit better also when I lay on my left I kind of feel like. Like did tremor in as well.

498.0,Provider,you're done with accent is it um is it immediate release or is it extended release.
15859.0,Patient,um What do you mean.
498.0,Provider,"On the bottle does it say, then the facts and I are or er."
15859.0,Patient,i'm not sure. I have it in my kitchen.
498.0,Provider,Okay.
15859.0,Patient,See. They all say that because this one doesn't.
498.0,Provider,If it doesn't say your specifically then it's likely immediate relief.
15859.0,Patient,So do they put it like in big letters with the.
498.0,Provider,surname it'll just be at the end of the name on the bottle.
15859.0,Patient,let's see. let's see HC ll er.
498.0,Provider,"Okay it's extended release okay and you're taking the 75 milligram per. And what time and you take yet. 9am 9am. And i'm you're taking two pills that are 37 and 37.5 milligrams each at 90. there's just 100% okay it's just a 75 okay you're okay. I just wanted to. Make sure, because I want to make sure that. i'm keeping a close eye on your side effects, just to see how we could you know, maintain the relief that you feel and offset some of those. Some of those out effects so."
15859.0,Patient,"So let me ask you, because i'm so sometimes I also feel like tension, like in my forehead. But I feel like it was coming from the back of my neck. Like a Bob just from the back doors the front end like my nose like if I was congested."
498.0,Provider,"You reported some nasal congestion to me on our on our last visit I was just going to ask you about that, because the nasal congestion itself. isn't necessarily. associated with the SSI usage, but. When you say like your Nick in. Are you filling. discomfort from your neck, and then you feel like it's moving to your sinuses is that what what what i'm hearing you say."
15859.0,Patient,"So what I feel is the pressure so i'm thinking. it's kind of like strange to this guy so I feel like on my nose but it's so deep like I feel like to the back of my head, you know what I mean so it's just congested, it is the forehead but but i'm not I don't have stuffy nose I just feel the pressure. But sometimes one one or the other gets you know stuff that but. i've been using the sailing water. To just like flow and. Of course, you know i'm not congested so I just feel like he helps a little bit to release some of the pressure when when the sailing goes. I also mentioned, I have some neck problems so i'm trying to like make sure it's not just you know the medication or my neck."
498.0,Provider,"And, have you did mention that you are following up with a primary care provider for your neck. Is that you have that visit on last Thursday."
15859.0,Patient,"So I had the MRI done last Thursday and this morning, I have to follow up but. Dr and that's something I also wanted to ask because, so I have had Nick issues for some time and. So I do know that. And I also have migrants, so I know that they sometimes inject botox around the hairline or the back of the neck. So I wanted to ask if that's safe for me to do."
498.0,Provider,In combination with your. Your exercise.
15859.0,Patient,"or any type of injection so they might want to put to relax the muscle if that's what's causing me some. discomfort because I know they also you know, can do that. What they call him. epidurals for steroids, or I didn't know what they use but."
498.0,Provider,As your as your. As your primary care provider cleared you for botox i'm just curious because of the. Because of the neck problem. Have a clue almost as usage for the migraine.
15859.0,Patient,"They gave me the approval, but I didn't do it because I wanted to go see my doctor first. One thing to interfere with the other."
498.0,Provider,Sure i'm not aware of any. not aware of any interaction between your exercise and botox i'm double checking here against your medical record on file. Let me check it against the trash that's what I want to check. One second. yeah it looks like there are many interactions between it and tries it on either i'm i'm familiar with the lack of any. and lack of any interaction between it and the visual effects in so. Just based on your. i'm sorry.
15859.0,Patient,"Oh, what about steroids, I mean I know they use different things, but i'm just saying botox is something I was just approved for but I didn't do it in two days, depending on what the appointment, you know results are then. i'll know exactly if there's something different than."
498.0,Provider,"Are you aware of which specific type of fear would deal they'll be considering for. No big logo or quarter go. I don't, mind you, once you getting. get some options from them. If you could just call back into the clinic just like you did last week with regard to the vaccine. and hold it in the flu feel free to call back into the clinic and provide me with exactly. What they offer you, and now I can clear them individually Okay, because that hate to give you a generalization. Okay, you know I just prefer for something not to slip through can you know just considering that you already have such specific side effects that's all."
15859.0,Patient,or muscle relaxers are they consider.
498.0,Provider,"Right now, just fyi and because you're kind of dealing with some additional fatigue as well just be mindful about. You know, taking a muscle relaxer he could exacerbate that the to. inquire again I hate to be so specific but, again, because you have such specific side effects, and you know, possibly it's not something, let me, let me look up one must specific muscle relaxer."
15859.0,Patient,"I have, I have something they gave me. But I haven't taken it because of the scene i'm not you know I don't want to. Book listen."
498.0,Provider,Exactly well look up. and see Sharon any interactions between back within and your ssri.
15859.0,Patient,There are.
498.0,Provider,There are not. Are they 10 milligrams five milligrams 20 milligrams.
15859.0,Patient,1010 milligrams.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and there are also not against your own as well."
15859.0,Patient,"So if I was to take this midday, because I hate to take vacations together, I always try to avoid that, especially if they're strong medications. So if I take the the morning pill, and then like midday one of this and then later at night, you know trusted on, then I should be okay right."
498.0,Provider,yeah that's fine Bernini there any interactions between the baclofen. Be than one faxon in the trouser don't.
15859.0,Patient,Okay.
498.0,Provider,What how many milligrams is the maxalt that you have prn for migraines is it five is it 10.
15859.0,Patient,"I believe it's five, and I have it right here, but. it's not in the box. yeah I think it's five I haven't I haven't taken it because. it's the I hate to take strong medication and i'm taking this new medication, because I feel that I really need it, but. i've been trying to avoid taking too much strongly occasions. And yeah."
498.0,Provider,"it's kind of wanted to follow up with you to see if. You felt the need to take it over the last week or so. If you had ever if you weren't have faced you know, an instance where you felt like you needed it in the last weekend it it doesn't sound like you have, which is good for me, because that means that. You haven't you know, had a migraine that sustains or that you felt like worn it."
15859.0,Patient,"No, no, like what I had. Last week I can't remember today but though almost like yeah intense it was bad. I have been taken just ibuprofen every six hours."
498.0,Provider,How often are you are you taking it every six hours every day or.
15859.0,Patient,have taken it so far. Like. I will say about yeah I think since last week okay.
498.0,Provider,Is it is it every day.
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,Are you still feeling to me breakthrough pain with that have you tried not taking it to see if you're still suffering from headaches.
15859.0,Patient,"I have not I just feel like okay i'm gonna try to avoid it but to avoid it to prevent it, but. yeah I have not trying not to okay."
498.0,Provider,Okay um. How about your vision that's something else that you report it. issues with.
15859.0,Patient,"So that sometimes when I get the tremors is when I feel like if my left eye. Because that's where I feel that that type of sensation is like if my left, I was a little bit blurrier than might right. But like rainy oh i'm okay."
498.0,Provider,"i'm. dry mouth that's something else, it looks like that you report it to me how's that going."
15859.0,Patient,I don't feel my mouth being dry as much.
498.0,Provider,OK OK. let's see what else teach you and tell me about you tell me about you saw me that is sleep issues have improved. The dry mouth has improved the vision has improved tremors are slightly improved. know no migraine treatment of headache but you're taking the ibuprofen. In an effort to control the fatigue has improved a little bit is what i'm hearing from you is that.
15859.0,Patient,A fair assessment yeah.
498.0,Provider,Just a little bit and kills your poor it some shields to me on the last visit how's that going.
15859.0,Patient,So this morning I was kind of feeling a little bit like that we're not first word for QA but right now i'm okay.
498.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and did you decide to get your flu that senior cold with that same."
15859.0,Patient,"i'm not yet i'm taking my parents with me, probably next week."
498.0,Provider,Okay um and then. How you feeling generally throughout the day now. Just you know. Completing your tab about your day your mood.
15859.0,Patient,"I don't feel us anxious as before, although I still get sometimes you know but. it's not like I can't control it like I was so the medication does keep me calm. Throughout the day except like when I feel the tremors it's like. I have to like. relax and like start breathing and or more around okay."
498.0,Provider,"As it right now, it seems like for the most part, generally speaking, the side effects that you report it to me on last week have all moved. in a positive direction and some a little just a tad bit less than others, but still it's all moving in a direction that I, like everything from the tremors to the sleep issues, the vision, the dry mouth and again today makes about 15 days. Since you started the medication so two weeks with some resolve is good, do you feel comfortable with continuing the medication, as is for another two weeks and. We can you know revisit its efficacy again at that time and me associated sound effects at that time as well."
15859.0,Patient,"um I think I can um, I guess, I can reach out in case of any anything any type of changes."
498.0,Provider,Absolutely absolutely it's always always available to me.
15859.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I should probably just continue on so. At the beginning, he was giving me half the morning half of night."
498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15859.0,Patient,"But I. am concerned that he will not let me sleep, do you think that could be something that could happen like if I was to split."
498.0,Provider,"Well, when you one of the reasons I asked about what time that you were taking it is because, if you're if you're sad effects and had not you know cut collectively as a whole, resolve some I was going to suggest. Making it, you know morning and night and. You didn't mention filling tremors. More in the morning versus late at night. Which is one of the reasons why I feel like it'd be okay, if you just did have you know half in the morning and half at night. Again, that was why actually did you have the 75 milligram capsules other 37.5 tablets, because you could still maintain the same dosage and just take have early and half late with the treasure don't you should still be able to sleep. If you find in the next week, two weeks that. you're still feeling the traumas haven't resolved enough for you. That you're still kind of having to deal with it then it's something that we could revisit if it's something that you like to do today. I don't I wouldn't I don't have any issues with that it's just that. at two weeks, you you you've adjusted some to those side effects. Optimal optimal benefit in scientific resolution is four to six weeks. And we're about halfway through the four week mark. So I could give you the option, you know saying well you know we could split split the dosage into two. morning evening or you could give it another week another two weeks see if there's some improvement if there's no improvement, and we could split it. If you continue to see some gradual improvement like you've seen over the last seven days, then you could stances, but I think I think that the medication as a whole is is benefiting you and it's just figuring our way and navigating through the side effects, and I think slowly. you're doing so naturally."
15859.0,Patient,"Okay yeah i'll just state that way, I will hate to change something and then. get older side effects or different something that is going to confuse anything."
498.0,Provider,"And it nothing's nothing's permanent if we find if you find and you know in another seven days that Oh, I feel a little bit better i'm glad we didn't make any changes, then we can stay the same, if you feel like. You know I feel like maybe I want to try it the other way, we can, nothing is it's never ever completely off the table it's just it's just a matter of administering the dose in a way that. You know it's most comfortable to you."
15859.0,Patient,mm hmm OK. I will like. we'll see how it feels within the next week or so.
498.0,Provider,Any changes to your past medical history or. Previous surgical history family history that we've already discussed any changes in nicotine us since our last visit. Any changes in alcohol use or substance you.
15859.0,Patient,"know but. Before is to sometimes have like a glass of wine, before going to bed not always. I understand now probably I can't take the one in the trusted after, of course. that's not something that would do. But it occasional me, you know, to go out and have a glass of wine is that something that. could possibly be done or I am completely you know."
498.0,Provider,"No, do you have do you have a preference like red wine. white wine you mean like a glass of wine with dinner."
15859.0,Patient,Just like moscato I think it's like a sweet wine that I.
498.0,Provider,"am glad glass of wine, a glass of wine, and I stress that a glass of wine. Is not. Is not. forbidden. i'm always always discouraged and casual alcohol use, but a glass of wine with dinner one day. it's okay it's okay. And remember that a glass of wine is roughly about four ounces. Not a not a."
15859.0,Patient,"Great topic. yeah I don't drink, but you know. Though and my friends are like we gotta go, we gotta take you out, you need to start going out and."
498.0,Provider,You know.
