Well, I appreciate it, thank you. Okay Karen is weekly so you're doing that so congratulations, have you been seeing your therapist. Let me go back up here, yes, is Stacy. It just yeah you saw Stacy yesterday, right. Great so therapist Stacey yesterday had it go for you get to get a lot of good talking she seems really easy to talk to. yeah that was your first appointment, or you got keep your next appointment. love it love it. Right I don't see where you've made any more appointments she's gonna make you some more points. Twice a mom. yeah. So i'll put this here make make appointment make appointment. To appointments with Stacey for October so make two appointments with Stacey for October okay she's a she's a she's a fun person to talk I enjoy doing groups who her seems really easy to talk to. You do you you're very supportive of your peers. And they're supportive of you to do you feel like both ways. Yes, Sir how's your addiction going any relapses a slip ups. you're a different person. you're a different person. Okay. i'm so happy. i'm so happy Well, my concern is this, are you drinking alcohol. This was your lap this was your lab I wanted to lay up check so and that was August, the ninth do you do you know why I don't want to mix an alcohol we don't want to mix an alcohol with your buprenorphine alok song. How much are you drinking your alcohol often are you drinking alcohol. or twice. mm hmm. yeah we checked for yeah we check for, and so my my My concern is that if if you continue to use the. The. you're the alcohol, with the buprenorphine, we have to be very careful that it doesn't increase your risk of overdosing and dying because buprenorphine is a safe drug is a very safe drug even at high doses, but if you mixing it with alcohol significant amounts. or muscle relaxers or said is like xanax out of and klonopin a value then that increases your risk of overdose okay. Are you able to stop your alcohol intake. Positive what alcohol i'm gonna have to wing, I will, when you will when you're buprenorphine. And, and all the reason to do that is not to be mean or cruel that's not how we are but is to protect you. Okay. i'm gonna keep checking you, but I like let me ask you this, without alcohol, do you have any seizures. Any shakes or tremors. Okay, we got a document that without alcohol no seizures shakes tremors any sweating. Okay, something more cancer okay so sweat and not unique for not having to alcohol, do you have any cravings for alcohol feel like you have alcohol withdrawal. So you you drink a few beers just to cope, what do you have any cravings for alcohol, or is this just your release Is this how you celebrate, why do you. Okay. Yes, sir. let's put it like this. We always we always recommend at least I do know marijuana Okay, because it is a mind and mood altering drug and it can negative impact your lungs. So smoking in general we you know anytime was marijuana or tobacco definitely want to encourage cessation. The alcohol or sedatives are the main ones that we're looking at that could increase your risk of overdose and why you on the buprenorphine so which one that I think it's more dangerous, I think the alcohol is more dangerous Okay, I would never recommend the use of. marijuana if for any reason, act thankful so but I definitely think that the alcohol use, especially if you're doing a six pack and you're doing the with the buprenorphine data increases your risk of overdose do I want you doing alcohol. marijuana no okay. All right, thank you. You you will you will. always be encouraged and cessation so. upset with you. Right right. Right you. Know we're not doing it. Okay. They give you to get off heroin methadone. You get there right. Yes. Okay. Thank you. yeah. You oh you do you do yeah you do urine drug screens every month, so you've been doing that, so that should come to you definitely. Just wants a month you you just. yeah there's a reason I should have a refill on it and that's probably because you've made missing some appointments. Because you've been missing some appointments i'm not cool enough. Let me double check here, because if you haven't because I don't go through the whole appointment schedule, but I just get the report that you're missing some appointments and need to attend to therapy. Okay. yeah let me see here.
