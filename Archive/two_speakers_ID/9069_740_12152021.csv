9069.0,Patient,I don't even know I just get sick or things I don't.
740.0,Provider,Finish.
9069.0,Patient,Things I start not doing what I need to do. But i'm okay now i've been working on spending more time with my children.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. Oh, I remember the last time we spoke, we talked about that, but you get an offer work earlier and having what you have when you can, for your whole life and don't be anymore. So, has been."
9069.0,Patient,"The last night I did two hours of homework, with my daughter. Which is ridiculous that a fourth grader has two hours of homework, why we enjoyed the time together, so it was OK. OK, and then the day before that I did a lot of work with my oldest son and tonight i'm going to do more work with him. So, and I asked one of my sons if he thought I should come home earlier like no you're good."
740.0,Provider,But what about what your husband.
9069.0,Patient,"He is angry at me right now, because. He does not feel I am living up to my. expectations and responsibilities."
740.0,Provider,Providing what expectation and responsibilities on one.
9069.0,Patient,"taking care of my children doing the dishes doing the grocery shopping all sorts of things. But he doesn't understand that, like like Sunday. No Saturday I spent like half the day working with my son, for his science club i'm the coach and like that is so much time to add think that should count because i'm doing it for my son. it's not like it's my job or something like that, but anyway, he he will be okay."
740.0,Provider,hear me okay.
9069.0,Patient,She will have to deal with it.
740.0,Provider,he's gonna have to do it.
9069.0,Patient,"He was slamming things around the House last night and I just said just do me a favor if there's something you think i'm not doing that you really think I should be doing just text me. And I will get it done. But I said I don't have the energy to read your mind and figure out what you want me to do so just tell me, and we won't have a problem. So i'm trying to make him do that."
740.0,Provider,So what do you find you can do on your end.
9069.0,Patient,"as well, I did the dishes last night and I left the kitchen clean when I went to bed on. If I don't like me and him split the work and he definitely does more work than I do. But he works at home and his work is really. easy if you asked me so he is a lot of time um. But. I forget what I was gonna say. Oh, but if I don't do the dishes fast enough for him, he will just come and do them and then not be happy that he had to do the dishes i'm like I was gonna do the dishes you just beat me to it. Why so."
740.0,Provider,"Maybe that's maybe maybe maybe maybe there's a. there's a gap there, maybe y'all just need to have a date night."
9069.0,Patient,"Oh, he won't he won't he won't. We, we have not done anything to get we used to go out to breakfast and maybe grocery shopping or something like every weekend morning of the warranty like every day me and went out for coffee. Every day i'm off work we bought for coffee. Now, like, for the past four weeks he's like no I don't want to go okay i'll go by myself so then. You will never go to a movie with what to dinner he won't go anywhere i'm like and I told him that the other day I just texted I said, I would just like to go somewhere with you and do something. Your choice. I don't know it's like he he's kind of a manipulator in that he thinks if he, like is kind of mean to me that I will change my behavior. been leading us mean to me. And doesn't want to go out with me i'm just like i'll just go out with somebody else done fine I don't want to be with your Derby I mean anyway and. Then it just gets worse and worse until he has to be extra me to get my attention, I think that's the patterns."
740.0,Provider,Whatever on do which.
9069.0,Patient,"He won't go to therapy with me i've tried, we went once and he he he likes my son's therapist and."
740.0,Provider,We.
9069.0,Patient,"Like family stuff with her and he's really good at it he's good at listening and talking but for therapy between us he just is unwilling, and we did it once and he just hated the guy."
740.0,Provider,Oh. Okay. well.
9069.0,Patient,"My advice. Work on myself and. hmm do what I think I need to do, and hopefully that will make him. He can be happier because of that."
740.0,Provider,But what's gonna make you happy.
9069.0,Patient,"Oh i'm I am pretty happy, I would like to have a date night with me."
740.0,Provider,Like he.
9069.0,Patient,"wants me to like loving want to be intimate with him, then like if you're being an asshole and will go out with me why would I want to do anything with you, I just doesn't make less it doesn't it does not stand to reason to me."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So how, how do you think we can make this, how do you think you can make this better oh yeah can work together to try to resolve we do you feel like it can be without."
9069.0,Patient,"I do think it can be resolved and I have been trying to calmly asked him to just like tell me if something's bothering him so if he, like communicates more, I think that will help."
740.0,Provider,But maybe I just need a moment.
9069.0,Patient,we're going to be on vacation so that might.
740.0,Provider,"want to wait wait, I went on vacation."
9069.0,Patient,or staying home until the 24th at midnight on the 24th we are going to southern Mexico with my family my sister's family and my mom. going there for about two weeks. it's gonna be. it's gonna be a lot.
740.0,Provider,Why.
9069.0,Patient,cuz it's two weeks with my family that's a lot yeah.
740.0,Provider,y'all get alone.
9069.0,Patient,"We get along, but we get along and noisy sword away."
740.0,Provider,Or maybe doing a time you and your husband can kind of step away and use it as a as a as a means to converge and talk.
9069.0,Patient,yeah that's a good idea.
740.0,Provider,"I think that's one of the best things that I would say, you know with me with my husband and I. You know i'm saying, is where we get to have the baby washes the baby and then we kind of get away. And then we get to have those hard conversations you know we added to a sale, you know what's been going on with you and how's life been for you and then. You know same way, and then you know what ways, you know you can improve and vice versa, and how can we, how can we do life together better think there's one of the main things. Is that how can we do life together better and so maybe that's a conversation that you and your husband can have together and just be like hey you know how can we do life together better."
9069.0,Patient,"I think that's terrific. I am going to try that. But I anticipate he's doing give me all answers I don't like because for him he's gonna he always makes everything now about our children. he's like I think BA BA BA BA BA BA like you want my daughter to have other extracurricular activities, she has activities, four days a week."
740.0,Provider,I think that's.
9069.0,Patient,"Good and then he wanted to do martial arts i'm like martial arts is not once a week and I said to the girl is Dr Michael how many times you do it a week she's like three yeah that's a lot of times. Right he's wants me to be like a driver 24 hours a day. To my for my children. But anyway, I think. Your ideas good."
740.0,Provider,"Well, I mean that I mean yeah go yeah the crazy fan ya gotta live together see my wish to figure out how to get along."
9069.0,Patient,"Yes, right."
740.0,Provider,"I mean that I mean that's that's so I mean that's that's the that's, the main thing for me it just the face of. It we got to live together, we might have let's try to figure out how we gonna get alone because you've been having their kind attention under one roof that's not good for nobody."
9069.0,Patient,"I agree, and I say that a lot to a lot of different people that you know you got to be here, why not be happy right. hmm."
740.0,Provider,Why make you know.
9069.0,Patient,desirable for no reason. This is my classroom behind me.
740.0,Provider,I know I see your classes before.
9069.0,Patient,Oh yeah you did. yeah right now I told my class if they cleaned up super fast and super good they could get extra recess they cleaned up every.
740.0,Provider,Oh wow. Well that's really good. I love.
9069.0,Patient,My week is my work very smooth and easy for me. hmm it isn't always like that so that's Nice.
740.0,Provider,So how has your anxiety been.
9069.0,Patient,"um it's been good, except for I think it was yesterday morning I just felt like something was off and I just felt terrible, I could not figure out why, and I texted my husband commented, but I feel better now okay."
740.0,Provider,Any Father depression is in my bed for the holiday.
9069.0,Patient,"Although. I noticed that, on the weekends, I like try my best to do nothing, and just hide in my bed every second of it. And I hope I don't do that on the vacation because I would like to live my life so i'm going to try not to do that."
740.0,Provider,"And a lot of times I mean you're a schoolteacher and you undergo a lot of stress. you deal with kids day in and day out so you're exhausted, because then you got to go home and do with your own kids and so that's not you don't really have much time for yourself and so. I mean that's like that's like the greatest face for you on Saturdays to be able to say in the bed is ever been really given intimate a clint inclination of depression, because you're out you're acting like that you just hired and your body is just trying to play catch up to you, basically. obeyed certain your energy. Every day, you know edwards and then having to do it at home, and so you just your body playing catch up, but I mean sometimes i'm not gonna lie to you. You know, because of the fact that you are going to tell you don't have to be able to interact with children, maybe you should say about two or three days aside just to kind of read. Because, by the time you look up beginning we kind of go back to school and then you're gonna feel like oh my gosh like I vacation but I didn't get to read. yeah, so I would say I was."
9069.0,Patient,"A cation. i'm going to be very comfortable and i'm going to be very comfortable saying to my sister, you know what you could take all my kids out all day and I will just sit here by the pool."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9069.0,Patient,And she will probably go okay. So I will have a lot of opportunities to relax.
740.0,Provider,"yeah so. it's just one of those things. You should you need to take that opportunity because. When you are finished, you are. working day in and day out, and since you're doing so much. Then you shoot I would encourage you to take those moments for you to read, because you don't want to be overwhelmed because you're so tired. Because you, they would exhaustion it comes strain and then you give and then you start to strain the you start to get anxious, sometimes we get depressed and there are a lot of times you thought you feel like you're overwhelmed."
9069.0,Patient,Because you got to. find in.
740.0,Provider,"Every you get right exactly so now, I think you should take those moments and take those days, to be able to kind of say no to some of those excursions and will happen i'm just gonna sit here i'm just going to sit and rest today. justin says, you will be gone for two weeks, they mean by the time you come back that means you only got three days before you start school again."
9069.0,Patient,"Sorry, no, no i'm coming back because we're not going to the 24th back late and i'm missing three days of school. Okay, I haven't missed a day and years. yeah so. yeah I get a lot of sick days and I don't take them, because now there are no substitutes so when you miss like a principal has to take your room. So it's really a hardship. yeah and on Tuesday of my vacation this week, one of my students who. lived in a domestic violence, shelter, but now is living in an apartment the mom and three kids. mean they got some sort of like toys for tots Christmas thing that they don't have a car so asked me to drive them and take them to that so that it's, it is a lot of time on my vacation, but I think that's so awesome i'm really excited to help them participate in that."
740.0,Provider,I think I think that's a good thing as well. So what else you got going on.
9069.0,Patient,"Today, I have my work holiday party."
740.0,Provider,Okay. And me I don't like a white elephant.
9069.0,Patient,"We are, and after this after Ray and I have to run somewhere and get a white elephant present and all them and trying to think of a good one."
