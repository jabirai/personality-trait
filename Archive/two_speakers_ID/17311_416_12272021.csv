Why are we making this hard. I found you okay. I feel so successful right now that just made my day. I just reviewed. Last time."
17311.0,Patient,"I didn't understand well it's funny I mean I went to the air force base and there are you know checked in with them, and all of a sudden, I looked down at my name and i'm like. Oh, my God that was my maiden name i'm like that was interesting to like actually see it like that, again, but my husband was laughing he's like ooh you've been on a military base before with the last name I was like."
416.0,Provider,"Wait middle name or your Mary thing, no, no."
17311.0,Patient,"Miller is my married name, let me put this out so is where it actually see my baby no I wouldn't think medical stuff would be in my maiden name."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
17311.0,Patient,"band, do you cheat graves. Oh, you wish yeah I had a hyphenated last name because. When my mom was a dog. Her name was dude she."
416.0,Provider,Her adopted name was going to do.
17311.0,Patient,"He, but when she separated from my dad she wanted us to have the same last name is her since she never changed her name when she got married so she hyphenated it as band he hyphen graves so anytime I was in trouble, I was always graves not buying the record, it was quite interesting."
416.0,Provider,"yeah well and, like our system medical systems, just to also don't know what to do with like. Multiple last names."
17311.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
416.0,Provider,"it's just so for us that make sense, my my husband has a double last name and. Nobody could ever find him."
17311.0,Patient,"or they I know that, and there was never a woman's origin name, to begin with, so they're all male surnames. Think about it, not funny."
416.0,Provider,funny.
17311.0,Patient,So we can tell okay.
416.0,Provider,"What who, who is your medical provider I can't remember."
17311.0,Patient,"Whoever is usually in group with us, if not, it should have worked under my regular doctor and I don't know why it didn't."
416.0,Provider,will not let me see who you are but I. So wait we're not prescribing them for you or your i'm confused.
17311.0,Patient,"yeah you did prescribe it for me, but I had also talked to my other doctor, just in case because last time. When I was needing the refill with you guys ever like oh I needed to do this and do this and do this and I was like I already did all those things and I was running out of MED so it's like oh shit. Okay, now, what do I do. kind of thing, so I think the day I have what."
416.0,Provider,You have.
17311.0,Patient,Your own me wrong.
416.0,Provider,"tanya is your met provider. So, are you coming to group tomorrow."
17311.0,Patient,i'm going to try to I have to write.
416.0,Provider,yeah just had been not feeling good.
17311.0,Patient,"And I had not been feeling good and had been feeling sick and then we had to get my daughter from she came home from the military and then my son came home from the military, so I had like I was up and down feeling really sick and yucky. So it's just kind of oh shit i'm supposed to be doing group but oh shit I got this other stuff where. Well, definitely try so."
416.0,Provider,The group is where you get MED refills.
17311.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,So do you have enough to get you to through today.
17311.0,Patient,"i'm not really, but it would just be like my nighttime MED, but like I said i'll call back to the pharmacy and see if maybe it did get taken care of."
416.0,Provider,And then just be that rounded group tomorrow and that way time you can refill for you.
17311.0,Patient,Okay. i'm writing it down better by right haha.
416.0,Provider,"No, we talked about a lot of stuff last time. I talked to the guy got a lot of information on your history and that sort of thing i'm wondering where you want to start in our work together."
17311.0,Patient,"I think i'd like to today, possibly work on how I can let go of resentments of how I feel people should behave towards me. IE my in laws. With it being Christmas. You know my mom is still alive, but she's not doesn't want to have anything to do with me and when I went into the hospital, I called my mother in law and my father in law, you know feeling really low and. horrible and left like a voice message, and then I went out to lunch with them with my husband and my daughter. You know, after I had gotten out of the hospital and my mother in law was you know slightly polite but, like my father in law didn't say, like any word at all. And I feel like it's so fucking damaging like you can't even say hi to me, you know blah blah blah like and so when I called my mother in law was like you know after lunch and like you know. Did you ever get that message that I was in the hospital and so forth. And she took like a second she's like well yeah I got that message and i'm like well. You know how come you guys didn't say like i'm happy your home or you know it's good to see you or anything like that, and she just kind of was like well you know i've been in and out of the hospital so much that. You know Earl doesn't want to even deal with it, or you know, like he just doesn't want to have anything to do with it and it's so it's like I feel the. Low self esteem from it like if I was better or whatever, and then it's also like I don't understand if you're supposed to be my father in law than act like a fucking dad and like treat me. Better and everybody's like basically like I need to just accept that that's how he is, and I can accept him or expect them to be a different way. Okay, so it's like I feel like I have to stuff my feelings. Or that and so now it's like everybody is supposed to go over to their house. You know, because, like they have all their military uniform stuff so they wanted to take pictures in their military uniforms and I yeah I mean, of course, I feel left out, but it's like it's hard I miss my dad really miss my dad. So I don't know."
416.0,Provider,"there's a lot of like. feeling really hurt that you didn't feel cared for in a time where you were hurt and vulnerable. And that sort of highlights even more the the missing your dad right it's like well my dad would have done this, my you know."
17311.0,Patient,yeah I know my dad would have yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah. So it just pushes that into into the stratosphere right even more pain than.
17311.0,Patient,You would normally experienced at that.
416.0,Provider,Point so.
17311.0,Patient,"they're all, just like in my house they're just like well that's just the way he is like you can't expect him to be any different and. I think that that's the frustrating part is like I don't think that he, like he likes me as a human being, like what would make me think that he even likes me as a human being, and so I don't want to be fake about it, I mean there are some people I don't like you know just."
416.0,Provider,"General think he doesn't like you, as a human being, does he treat you differently than he treats other people."
17311.0,Patient,think like he's a very judgmental human being.
416.0,Provider,"But. Only with you, or is he judgmental everybody, like everybody even like."
17311.0,Patient,"If he goes to church because he's a eucharistic Minister right. If people are like late hope he has an issue with that well why didn't they come on time and why blood it's like you should be happy they're there in the first place, you don't know why they're late or you know what they had to do in order to get there. He was highly decorated during Vietnam so he's got like a purple heart and like a silver star, you know, for doing his job and so he's very military oriented you know. And like basically my. My like she didn't want to be married to my brother in law anymore so she moved out and so now it's like now URL is like Oh well, she did this, and did that that died she did that that that that the debt, so now i'm realizing like Oh well, obviously, then you have a list is too. long, and so, then when they took the family pictures of my sister in law down, then they pretty much took the pictures of me down as well, too, and I was like what the Fuck did I ever do to you guys and they're like Oh, there was just too much clutter. Okay, that you know, that was a picture of me like you know, like with my family or like a picture of me doing search and rescue and getting awards from the Sheriff. Mills really fucking best diet."
416.0,Provider,So.
17311.0,Patient,Have you ever not to me. my head.
416.0,Provider,"So i'm your internets cutting out a little bit, but. Have you."
17311.0,Patient,So it sounds like it's a while.
416.0,Provider,It sounds like it's not just about you like he's not targeting you. It sounds like he sort of is generally just a guy who doesn't know how. And who doesn't have a lot of skills around being compassionate and understanding. And tuning people's emotions.
17311.0,Patient,"yeah because my mother in law, no that's accurate, because my mother in law she's been in and out of the mental hospital since i've known her. And she says a lot of it is you know because of him, like they sleep in separate bedrooms it's just awkward it's weird and. So when it was like Christmas and they're like Oh, we want you to come over at this time and. We have this kind of food ready, and we were like we pretty much have the day already planned you know picking up my son and do it, like all this other stuff and then they were like. Okay, well then come over at this time, so you'd be will be ready at this time and we're like seriously, you can come over here and they were like no we can't do that."
416.0,Provider,"So there's a. i'm just curious if we know if you know that he is like this sort of across the board, even to his own wife. Why is this, why does it feel so personal to you. Because it sounds like you're you know you really are seeing that is very personal."
17311.0,Patient,"one. yeah. It does feel very personal that I is my Internet messing up smart. It does feel very. Personal because it's like again, you know again it's i'm. From owners. Turn contest a year and I."
416.0,Provider,just keep thinking if I.
17311.0,Patient,Just do something better or right or whatever. No. No let's see can I move around some. me is that better.
416.0,Provider,So far we can try it.
17311.0,Patient,Is that better.
416.0,Provider,I think so.
17311.0,Patient,"I don't think I think it's just because of the simple fact that he never had children have been to all fucking. Not, like the other."
416.0,Provider,So.
17311.0,Patient,Change the oil.
416.0,Provider,"Is personal to you, even though you know, like intellectually, you know that it's not personal. Right in your in your kind of rational mind. You understand that this is not about you at all that he treats everybody. This way. But it. But it hurts you. Right so there's a part of your brain, and this is where we get into some what I call cognitive distortions or what are called cognitive distortions right, these are thinking errors. Where. Where we switch things from oh that's. That is just who he is he treats everybody this way it's his shortcoming, not mine, too, this is about me. And I must be not doing things correctly. Right. So I call these cognitive distortions are thinking errors like I said. I call them brain weasels because they get in our head and they like weasel around in there and they're just really nasty actually got that from a patient they're hilarious. and It was like brain weasels it's so perfect right they get in there and they route around and these thoughts right they really make us miserable they just kind of circle around in our. So what you're describing is a cognitive distortion that I would call personalization and i'm going to hold on one second I won't be able to see you i'm going to read to you. What it is and. And you tell me if this happens to you and your life. boo boo boo let me find it on here. here's. A good explanation of it okay. So here's the i'm just gonna read this to you, we all place blame for things that go wrong in our lives. If the car had not cut you off, you would have been in a better mood if your son has not forgotten to load the dishwasher. You would have gotten to bed on time and woken up more refreshed right, etc, etc. However, many people who are struggling with anxiety or depression engage in a much more negative type of thinking called personalization in this situation they blame themselves or someone else but usually some themselves. for something that was actually caused by a complicated chain of events or that was otherwise completely outside of their control. So, for example, many survivors of childhood abuse blame themselves for the."
17311.0,Patient,abuse that.
416.0,Provider,"They endured so personalization is the belief that you are entirely to blame for something even though you had little or nothing to do with the outcome. In fact, the situation may not be connected to you in any way at all, it can also involve blaming someone else for which they have no responsibility, but I don't think that's the case in this one so. personalization and blame can vary from situation to situation, but it always involves negative thinking and often hinges on your negative self talk. So some examples of symptoms include feeling like you're to blame when someone else does not have a good time when they're with you are feeling like you're being intentionally excluded from a group when you see members interacting together, but without you. or feeling like. You did something wrong to have your pictures taken down in your in laws house. or feeling like. You know him not talking to you or checking in with you in in the hospital or afterwards means that he doesn't like you, or has done something wrong. Right. Does that sound."
17311.0,Patient,"Familiar yeah and it just it just it's it's. It hurt you. i'm staying here after all the divorce stuff and when I even talked to him about her being in the hospital is just like Oh, you know, like has this shit look on his face like we're just so. not good enough to be in his fucking presence that it's like. I just I hate it they hate that I wish that he was a little bit more of a decent person and what hurts the most is like you say you know, do I feel like I am. Now, not part of the group I don't because it's like my husband has a uniform my daughter has a uniform my son has a uniform and even though I did eight years of search and rescue like recovering bodies that are dead, I will still never live up to his. thought of what is acceptable, is a good woman. But yet we'll see a woman and like an airborne uniform, it is like like gaga overheard it's like big fucking deal she jumped out of a fucking plane so fucking what like I don't mean it mean. But I just would like. I would like the reciprocation of like yes i'm a good decent human being. And my husband and my daughter, just like that's just not his way like he's not ever going to say he's sorry sorry because he doesn't think he's sorry. he's not going to be like oh contest I love you like you're a good daughter in law because that's just not his personality, but I keep hanging on to if I would just do things better, then. So that it's like I feel like even with my good work buddy butting heads, because he wants me to just kind of get over it. And I feel like been the same cycle for like the last 24 years and I want to get off the fucking stupid merry go round about it, and I think that that's the hardest part."
416.0,Provider,Because what am I turning my husband coming over there and it's like. If we started to challenge the thinking that you are somehow responsible for how he feels or how he behaves.
17311.0,Patient,"not responsible for how he behaves, but I think that that's what the whole point is yeah that's the whole point, though, is is like. If, after 24 years i've never lived up to his expectations and then they'll say like stupid shit about like my tattoos and I hate that like we me the Fuck alone, I, like my tattoos I think they're beautiful they're art to be and it's just like oh that's not what I needed did you know."
416.0,Provider,"i've always had, why is it safe. For you, if you're not responsible for his feelings and if you don't require his approval to survive right, you can coexist with him, then what does his approval, why is."
17311.0,Patient,Why is that something that.
416.0,Provider,Jason tailing.
17311.0,Patient,"I think, because i've never experienced it and so it's so frustrating like you know he feels like he's the head of the family, even though my husband has. You know he's only like this step. dad he's not even my husband real bad. So. I don't know I Emily."
416.0,Provider,Even as the head of the family and as your husband step dad Why is his approval so important to you what does it mean to you.
17311.0,Patient,"I think it's because of you know my dad dying and it's like I think of heavens, like a dad and that I long to hear and be like you know I love you like. I appreciate you being in my life like i'm the only went all these fucking years that remembers his birthday that buys and Christmas gifts, for it, you know, like out of all of us, nobody else does that and so it's like oh. Because I was mentally good well you can't even talk to me like say hi like I just. heard he wants to hurt like he hurts me like feel that and I know he just doesn't have any feelings towards that it's like oh you and my wife and my niece now or granddaughter or just you guys are pathetically week because of your depression. and it's like i'm not gonna lie it fuckin it hurts like. So why is it so important to me because. Now, yes, because I just missed my dad so much that."
416.0,Provider,And he.
17311.0,Patient,My dad you yeah and I.
416.0,Provider,Just conditional acceptance and love.
17311.0,Patient,It. quiet. yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
17311.0,Patient,"it's like I bet right when. Right, when my dad got the diagnosis of alzheimer's and it's like right after that that my dad just completely stopped talking. And so RON Chris this like. alright. he's a human being to. Because even like somebody that you don't like he would like kind of acknowledge their presence when you're having a deal with them."
416.0,Provider,We ever said anything to him directly about it.
17311.0,Patient,"was going to but no I haven't you know, like usually what happens is it's usually this type here, then I go over there, like an act like nothing fucking happened that's always the way it goes, you know. I think if I were to directly like say something to him, he would just be like oh. No and not really I think he would dodge the conversation. You know, and I mean and everybody else, says the same. thing to like he's not going to. Like confronting him or whatnot is not something that."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
17311.0,Patient,What yeah.
416.0,Provider,"All right, i'm just jotting down a couple messages and listening to kind of. The stuff that's connected to this but um so. What i'm hearing is a lot of like feeling really powerless. Really seeking that sort of unconditional love and acceptance from a parent. Or the next best thing apparent figure and being really devastated because you're not getting it right you're looking for like kind of a replacement for what you've lost and the sad reality is that he's not that person. right and it isn't because there's anything wrong with you it's because he just simply does not have the capacity to do it it's like asking a. it's like asking a. One year old to do calculus they simply can't do it. right they don't have the mental capacity to do it. Not that he has like one year old but that's it, I mean that's what it is not everybody has the capacity to relate to. Other people. In healthy ways. So. it's. it's his shortcoming not. yours. And I can tell you that, until that you know the days dark and you're you're maybe right still going to be able to digest it, because your heart is still hurting so much from your dad's loss. And instead of looking for a replacement, it might be important to just let yourself."
17311.0,Patient,grieve.
416.0,Provider,What you don't have right. And that probably sounds intolerable team i'm guessing.
17311.0,Patient,"Just hard, because that it's like I know that my boss is alive she's not even that far, for me, but it's like she realistically doesn't even want to talk to be too, so it just it just does feel like. If I could you know if she wasn't alive, maybe I could grieve her, but instead it's like i'm grieving that. That both of my parents and it's just so hard to. Great yeah I agree that not have the reserve not be like no I. expect you to be a better fucking."
416.0,Provider,person.
17311.0,Patient,"Like it be like oh can just like you're okay it's supposed to be feeling like Oh, they realistically don't want be alive around that but that's what it feels like when he doesn't talk to be like I just. Just and then like every surgery or something he'll be like well I don't want to bother you guys, so I got the uber driver and you're like you're not even supposed to have a fucking uber driver you up like it's even in the anesthesia paperwork know uber or lyft driver. So it's like, why do you think you're bothering us so then that's you know what starts my head like you say doing the weevil saying or weasels."
416.0,Provider,"You know, like."
17311.0,Patient,"by you, so the selfish part of me that's like well, I mean it's not like he's leaving me anything in his will i'm just the wife i'm a nobody to this person, why do I have to be nice. I could not being mean but I mean if everything in his house goes to his brother what's the fucking point like i'm not and I don't mean that in a selfish way but. If if you don't think that we're your family capable of making sure that we close and finish everything out for you, then I don't understand that. Like I mean I know his brothers his brother, but his brother lives states away, and I mean i've probably seen his brother twice, maybe three times in 24 years. So. I don't know why I think that way."
416.0,Provider,"I think, maybe."
17311.0,Patient,If he is.
416.0,Provider,Thinking about so i'm going to share his Has anybody ever done work with you on like circles of control and influence.
17311.0,Patient,No.
416.0,Provider,"Let me write, as I said that that."
17311.0,Patient,"That made me think of my mom and like that's the whole point is like with my mom it's like when she passes on she wants everything for her. You know, common law husband and all that, and so it feels the same you know, like Oh well, you, you would leave your husband and move into my house, so I can't possibly leave you my house okay i'm glad you know that about me but that's exactly what my mom did so it's weird. What did you call it circles of what."
416.0,Provider,"circles of control and. influence so i'm gonna i'm gonna pull this up here. hold on, let me pull up an image. This isn't the best one, but this is and i'm going to share my screen with you, so you can see it on tech. Make sure that there's a. Eric. yeah there we go. Let me share my screen. Alright, so. We think of these three concentric circles right. The very Center one is us, and this is the stuff in any given situation that we can control that we have full control over, and not just full control over we have responsibility for these things right, we have responsibility for our actions in this, so we have responsibility for. You know. What we think we have responsible for. ability for our behavior around buying things around where we live around. You know our behavior in response to other people sorry. I should have turned that on silent sorry i'm already have hopes and now I switched off, why did it switch off hold on let's. switch to my my workout videos you don't want to see that."
17311.0,Patient,"Right, let me. Let me pull up. So wait, I took a screen no I took a screenshot of it, so the middle one is."
416.0,Provider,"What are the by. The Middle one is it's not just what you buy I mean these aren't the best this is your behavior in the middle, because at the end of the day, okay that's all we can control it's what's going on. With us right. Okay, now, this second circle is. Is. Our things that we have influence over, but other things influence them to right we don't have full control over these things. And this one doesn't say it, but one of my favorite things here is your children. Right and your children are grown. But like you know people are always like control your children well you know what. We can't control our children yeah. We can influence their behavior. And we can influence how they live, and we do most of us right, but we cannot. And the end of the day, they are, they are their own. person we can influence, whether or not we get the promotion at work by controlling our own behavior but we can't fully determine whether or not we get it we can't control that can influence our health, but we can't control it right."
17311.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"And then the outside, one is stuff that we might find concerning we might find ourselves thinking about it but it's not. stuff that we have any control at all over. and Other people and their emotions is at the top. Right, we have no control over how others perceive us and we have no control over their emotions, with regard to us, we have no control over other people's behaviors."
17311.0,Patient,and
416.0,Provider,"You have full control of ours, but what happens, a lot of times, especially with folks who struggle with anxiety and depression is, we find ourselves spending a lot of time and energy out here. Trying to. Trying to make people like us worrying about the news worrying about the government worrying about all this stuff. And then, our energy goes so much into this that we don't have energy for this middle part. And then we. feel like we can't control that middle stuff."
17311.0,Patient,"yeah and I ended up doing, where I had a friend, you know do an order for me, as this is, you know your business succeeding, and then it's like she was like Oh well. yeah i'll get back to you and then i'm like well when when do you want this order you know, and so I texted her hey i'm going to be around you nothing no reply, back then, a week or two later oh yeah I need to get my order and i'd be like Okay, when what would be a good time nothing. And then, all of a sudden, it was like oh. I can come by your House tonight, and we were getting ready to leave for the airport and I was like literally I don't even want to sell you this shit anymore like that pissed off of. And then, all of a sudden she's texting Oh, I just want to check in on you, how are you doing and I have no desire to invest any more time into that person. And, and I would was noticing, it was the mind loop of Oh well, my stuff wasn't good enough for her as opposed to whatever else she had going on."
416.0,Provider,"Right, this is her behavior it has nothing to do with you. Have you ever heard the expression and other people's opinions are none of your business."
17311.0,Patient,uh huh yes.
416.0,Provider,Like my mantra sometimes I just keep saying this to myself.
17311.0,Patient,"And I think that that's what's the frustrating aspect with me as because I I do care what a lot of people's opinion. of me is and then my husband will always be like well do they pay your bills like are they you know, supporting you, and if the case is no which is 99% no, then why are you so worried about them. And I. Think maybe That just goes back to my mom and not being. You know, like, no matter what I did in her eyes never good enough. Never. I mean, even when I would recover bodies, it was like you did it wrong it's like. How do you. How do you recover a fucking body of a person's family wrong. I got."
416.0,Provider,"It all it's just like triggering this really old. wound for you right which is so deeply held, which is that feeling that feeling that it kind of keeps coming up for you, you keep expressing it here and i'm hearing it loud and clear, just like this. Not being accepted this not being seen not being loved. Not feeling really heard and understood and appreciated that's a deep wound."
17311.0,Patient,"that's why my husband is like, how do you fill that whole that you have you know you keep trying to fill it with like shopping or you know this or that and he's like it's never going to be filled and i'm like well that doesn't help. You don't want to be that abyss that's like where where does it end, how do you fix that."
416.0,Provider,"It can be filled. And it will be and it's just not likely to be filled by outside sources and that's The thing is, like you know when we have a deep wound like that, and we look for something outside of us to fill it and replace it. that's when we start getting into some trouble right, because then we feel so desperate to us. To you know. To cover the auchi or to fill the wound that we end up reaching for things that aren't healthy for us like you know. shopping addiction, or whatever it is right people reach for drugs and alcohol people reach for. For people that aren't healthy for them. People do all kinds of stuff to try to fill that gap, and then it just makes things more complicated and it's and it it it ends up hurting more right because not only do you not have the gap filled, but now you have all kinds of other stuff going on."
17311.0,Patient,"yeah, and so it just it makes it like so much more. prevalent. than what I see my husband and my kids and their uniform and it's like I mean I have my I still have my uniform. And, like me and the kids and my husband was like well well let's take a picture with you in your uniform and us and our uniform and this is how our family looks now kind of thing and. it's like i'm nervous to even take the picture, because I feel like a fraud like. And I don't like that you know yeah it's not really the same as being in the military, like the. And I think that that's the hard part it's like, even though I went through all the wilderness programs, and all that surviving on my own, I still like I was it like a boot camp so. I think that that's something I have. No way to guess being happy for who I am and what i've gone through, as opposed to thinking that it just wasn't right and that I was some like troubled person okay."
416.0,Provider,"So we talked about this thing. i'm sorry i'm just writing myself a note about that and. We talked about this in therapy a lot among therapists and we talked about re parenting. And a lot of times when we have these old wounds that came from a long time ago that came from a hole that was never filled and. we're we we end up having to kind of become our own parents right to kind of. that's where that wound gets full filled. that's where it starts to heal. And this is something we can do to our little by little, but some of it starts with the messages that we are a lot of it starts with the messages that we give to ourselves right like that staying out away from the brain weasels or at least noticing the brain weasels when they come."
17311.0,Patient,up.
416.0,Provider,"When you find yourself in a position where you're like I need this man to love me I need him to appreciate me I need to. Your his opinions of you are in your business. But you are loved and appreciated and and his love or no love doesn't change the fact that you are worthy. of love that you are lovable that you are important that you are critical person in your family's life and in this world. Right. So starting to change the messaging that you give to yourself, is a first step. And even if you don't believe it right away, which you might not. It might not feel true when you first say to you to yourself. These messages that we say to ourselves start to become our thoughts and our thoughts become our beliefs so saying is just as important, even if you don't believe it right."
17311.0,Patient,That make sense yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Can we says, I mean."
17311.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I mean that's usually what happens when I start getting on the hamster wheel it's like oh my God, you know it's like I have all the evidence of how i'm unworthy and I did the but to like shift and see that, like I am worthy would be nice like. yeah yeah."
416.0,Provider,So that's gonna have to come from you. Right. This is where you come in. let's make sure it comes from you.
