120.0,Provider,"Alright, this is the bio psychosocial intake evaluation for Sarah color. Also in group yesterday I was having problems with my Internet, and so it kicked me off, which then defaulted. To give host. To a group member so when they clicked off at the end of the group it close the meeting and I wasn't able to. give any more information about the group I was going to give you some more information about the living skills group I did yesterday, basically, it was the bus activity one, but with a little bit of a different twist to it, where we were going to create an image of the parts of the self. Rather than just using the bus thing with a piece of paper that I traditionally have done so, if you want to just. alter the description. For that group and. Basically, using the ISS model for understanding the parts of ourselves and instead of putting a doing the bus activity doing a. An illustration of our different parts, I can also send an email about it, but I just want to tell you, since i'm waiting for the patient to show up here so. I will. put this on pause. Hello. hi Sir I apologize, I put their number and I slipped a number. wrong and I didn't it was just one digit off, I saw that yeah no no all right. Look i'm sorry I was trying to do it quickly and yeah that's what happened so anyway."
15076.0,Patient,burnout yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Yes, yes i'm glad we were able to make this work, though, so. i'm glad it's working for you so i'm sorry i'm Kelly i'm one of the therapists at bright heart. And, have you ever done this kind of an intake assessment before."
15076.0,Patient,No i've done a lot of therapy. done an intake assessment.
120.0,Provider,So okay alright so basically what this is is it's just kind of a chance for i'm going to ask you a bunch of questions. kind of about your history and what you've been struggling with and it's chance for you to ask questions to about us and what we have to offer to see if it will be helpful for you and just to kind of leave it's a good fit okay what we're looking for. and Do you have any questions before we get going.
15076.0,Patient,"um I kind of asked amanda Hurst a couple questions, but just so I understand so Basically, this is sort of is this sort of to assess whether or not I have an eating disorder or what kind of services would work best for me or."
120.0,Provider,"All yeah. kind of yeah yeah it's it's kind of a way of assessing yeah if it's like a diagnosable eating disorder that that piece, but then also if if we are the right level of care because, like we offer. In the eating disorder in the in the world of eating disorder treatment there's basically five levels of care. That are based on kind of. The severity of a symptom um and the lowest basic level of care is outpatient where you go and just go like once a week. Right and and the the suggestion is always to meet with an eating disorder therapist and an eating disorder dietitian. hey together, like, I mean two separate sessions, but that the you get both of those pieces because they're both really important when it comes to recovery. And then the step above that is the I O P program which stands for intensive outpatient and that and what we are we do that one is it's 11 hours a week of therapy so it's a combination of groups and individual. So. So anyway, I it's kind of identifying like what level of care would be most recommended for you are, you are you looking mainly for outpatient are you interested in the I O P Program."
15076.0,Patient,"outpatient I mean, I would just given, I mean i'm obviously not an expert at all and eating disorders, but, given what i've read and what I kind of. Understand about myself, I think I don't have like a textbook I don't I don't have interests, I mean i've definitely flirted with anorexia in the past. And i've never purged a definitely binged for like decades."
120.0,Provider,But I don't.
15076.0,Patient,"know if it's to the level of like an outpatient program I was sort of envisioning. and actually I told this to me as to what really triggered this is both my husband my husband grew up. In a morbidly obese family in a time when that was really unusual he's 44 now so that was in the 70s and 80s. his entire life his mom his dad has two siblings all five of them were were morbidly obese and we have two children who are in the obese category BMI wise. To me, they don't look over you know obese to the eye and there's they're both just really solidly built kids, but I feel both of us fear that we are passing on unhealthy food. Models unhealthy relationship with food to our kids and we want to like nip that in the bud. As. Much as we possibly can, and and sort of have an understanding on how since we don't have a good relationship with food understanding how to develop a good relationship for ourselves, and then also model that and talk to our kids about that, so that we. don't repeat the obesity."
120.0,Provider,"that's really cool actually that. Like that that is your you know, one of your big motivators is to you know, have a better something better, to offer to your kids to pass along to them, then what your husband had so."
15076.0,Patient,"We yeah and both of us have just like obsessive we have SAS over food and it's that I mean i'm sure. Most of your patients feel this way is that you just feel held hostage by these thoughts and just don't a don't want to live that way anymore, and we don't want to pass that on to your kids. Right right."
120.0,Provider,"yeah cool well that makes sense, you know and. You know there, I think that there's a large double number of people, especially in our society that has you know strongly disordered eating, even if they're, even if they don't fit every like box for eating disorder. um. You know, and I think that everybody message it has some it's hard not to with all the different messages because. I knew everything so."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah the number of people, I feel like I know who have what I would call a healthy relationship with food is I can probably count on one hand, I mean, I really do like most people. are so confused and don't know what to eat and don't know how to eat and yeah so i'm hoping that if I do something like this, you guys will say this is how you do it."
120.0,Provider,"yeah and I always think that one of the best examples of having a good relationship with the food is a little tiny baby is a little tiny kid because when therefore they stop eating. exactly like they know when they're and you can't force it and mix it up. yeah and then, when they are hungry, then they want to eat they don't. purposely restrict they're not worried about do I deserve it. they're not doing that, they just know how to listen to their body, because they haven't been told, otherwise yet. You know so anyway it's kind of an interesting thing about like that they just they don't Center their lives around it so."
15076.0,Patient,yeah no I love it. yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah then they kind of get. It gets confusing, as you get older for sure so. yeah OK so just to make sure i'm understanding you're right your your primary you're looking for like outpatient services you're already seeing a therapist you said or you've done therapy before."
15076.0,Patient,"You seeing a therapist off and on for years, my husband and I occasionally see one who we've also gosh we've been seeing her for 20 years I think our last session with her was earlier in 2021 so we sort of see her as needed. You like we need a little extra help."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, is it like a couple therapy or each of you guys see them individually."
15076.0,Patient,it's a couple stare.
120.0,Provider,"couples okay. So that's that's kind of just as needed but it's not something you're doing, like every week correct yeah okay. All right, and then you have Have you ever worked with a dietitian before."
15076.0,Patient,"No, I never have."
120.0,Provider,"Alright, so I would love for you to be able to work with a dietitian at some point, because I think it's going to be a whole nother world you haven't ever got to experience."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah you know, because there are certain there are some kind of. You know diet models out there that can really kind of confuse you and eating disorder dietitian is always focused on moderation and there's no good or bad food, food is just a thing. And it's just about kind of finding balance and variety that kind of thing so it's a lot they don't usually endorse any type of like restrictive type of approach. Because that tends to lead to bingeing."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah that's kind of I don't know if you can answer this question this might be a dietitian question but um. I keep reading conflicting information on because I feel like I am personally a sugar addict and I keep reading information conflicting information on whether that's a thing or that's not a thing, sometimes I read that. Eating disorder specialists say cut sugar out but that's it don't cut anything else out and sometimes I read eating disorder specialist say no don't cut anything out just practice everything in moderation and there's really no such thing as food addiction it's just sort of your own. You know session or."
120.0,Provider,"Right right. Well, and you know there's different schools of thought. The idea of it being an addiction is not really. The the chemical itself is not an addiction, you know it's like it's like saying you're addicted to air. Your body needs air it needs fuel. You know, but what you might be addicted to is the patterns associated with eating. because sometimes when you. are eating, something that you've kind of deemed is forbidden, you know as being bad with sugar in it. or whatever you that it's kind of like who i'm being naughty you know eating it and that's a little bit thrilling and a little bit shameful and a little bit exciting. it's like when you're a teenager and you sneak out or whatever you kind of do something that you're not supposed to be doing, but it feels kind of. Good but that originally was bad I got in trouble that you know or whatever it's sometimes it can be a little bit of an addictive process, especially if if you don't really know how to take good care of yourself. And and practice stress management outside of eating. You know, sometimes people who have eating problems or eating imbalances tend to have developed patterns in our life, where eating is there. One of their primary hobbies it's one of the things that they do with know when they're happy when they're sad when they're bored when they're you know we can it's kind of like they can escape into food and so that part can be kind of an addictive process. versus the sugar itself because, like in your you know your body doesn't it just kind of. it's it's like any particularly or addictive process like you know gambling or sex or different types of chemicals, you know you know it can kind of. It kind of creates a pattern that your body gets some some something you know some kind of satisfaction from. And so it's not necessarily the sugar specifically. And the general rule of thumb is that, as soon as you restrict it. Then it makes you think about it more it's the same ideas, the toilet paper thing last year. yeah as soon as we didn't think we'd have it, what did everyone do. yeah they hoarded it right so as soon as you don't think you're going to have it you're like well I got to get this now, and so it's kind of this idea of scarcity and our brain to that was sugar to or any other kind of food. So, so you tell yourself I can't have that that's bad. there's a PC that's like well, I have a one more time. or i'll have it. i'll have it one time and then i'll then i'll cut out tomorrow. Right or girl does or there's like shame associated with it, and then it kind of becomes a bit, but if you can have anytime you want to. Like I can relate I don't have to eat the whole bag of stickers Halloween candies right now, because I could have one now I want I can have one, you know tonight I could have one tomorrow yeah."
15076.0,Patient,I will always be there. yeah.
120.0,Provider,"And it's not so exciting, you know, like it is when. If it's forbidden so that's kind of the idea behind that but. In the way that it."
15076.0,Patient,works is the therapy sessions are to deal with them the mental part of the eating disorder and the dietitians are basically telling you the physical part more or less.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well and they kind of. part of their job is to help educate you on food because. there's so many so many ideas out there about what food does and there's so many fad diets out there, that people try and there's all these different kind of like you know do this do this do this and the vast majority of them are. You know, geared you know, making money, and so they do something that gives kind of quicker results and the people tend to want to do it, but then they almost always backfire something like 98% of diets fail."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know and and I saw this thing it was like if you if you went to buy a car and the car salesman says 98% of these cars are going to fail. You know, would you still buy the car, you know."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know thinking it's going to be right for it's gonna work for you, like you, wouldn't do that. Right you'd say I need something that has a little bit of a track record. Right um but we keep doing it because we have this kind of compulsion to yeah and so dietitians will kind of. Help educate you about the way that you process food, and you know these different ideas like what about this, what about this things that you hear online or whatever, and they kind of help set the record straight through some of that and then try to help you. To kind of. stop thinking and food in terms of good or bad."
15076.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Because it's not a moral decision. You know you're not a better person, if you eat an apple than a piece of cake. Right, you know your body will just feel differently, but it won't you know and your nutritional requirements are you know, like you'll feel better if you eat certain types of foods."
15076.0,Patient,That are.
120.0,Provider,"More balance, you know, but it doesn't make you a better or worse person."
15076.0,Patient,The rent what you just yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So, but yeah so dietitian kind of works on that stuff and then the therapist kind of works on let the beliefs about our lives and about ourselves, and about. How we approach things in our life that are adding to feelings of anxiety or depression that that are driving us to numb ourselves with food because food behaviors are typically like a way to manage emotional stuff. same as any other addictive process. And so, part of the therapy, you know process is to kind of understand yourself enough to know where your. Achilles tendon you know where your Achilles heels are like where you're the thing the patterns that you tend to fall into and to avoid. or to have knowledge of those so that you don't keep falling for the same little tricks that that you fought for before that your mind sets up for you."
15076.0,Patient,Right right so totally. If if we were to move forward with this would you would you be my therapist or do I get assigned to someone or How does that usually work.
120.0,Provider,Or what state are you in.
15076.0,Patient,i'm in California.
120.0,Provider,"Your California, I would not be because i'm not licensed in California okay i'm all of us have different States I have like 11 states but California, not one of them, so you would have one of the California once but we have a lot of them so. yeah so that that's how that works, and if you were in if you were an iot program it sounds like you're interested more just outpatient if you weren't I O P, I read some of the groups with that."
15076.0,Patient,Oh OK.
120.0,Provider,"I am involved with that, but your individual would be somebody that is licensed and dietitian or will have to be licensed whatever state you live in."
15076.0,Patient,got it okay.
120.0,Provider,So that's kind of how that works. and Can you tell me a little bit about how kind of your your eating disorder patterns like your ways of that you approach food how it interferes with your well being with like your life you already mentioned that I think about it all the time. yeah taking a big chunk of your.
15076.0,Patient,"consciousness yeah and you know I feel like. I I definitely use it as a coping mechanism. I definitely use it to cope with stress. I also know that. I know this consciously but I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it um when I feel like I need a break. I somehow feel like i'm not entitled to break So if I involve food that feels like Okay, then I know I have licensed for this break and it makes the. makes the right feel better because i'm having you know or whatever i'm having with it yeah I often pair it with activities, I enjoy and so becomes like. An integral part of the activity so like reading I love to read so i'll read with you know you while eating something or i'll watch V or a movie while eating something. I recently had put on a lot of weight, I put on. let's say I went I went for a physical like two weeks ago I put on 10 pounds in a year, but before that, I mean i've put on probably 30 pounds in the last three four years and five one and a half, so that's a lot for my frame. And so, then what i'll do is i'll say okay. i'm going to only eat clean, you know and i'll I mean I do the classic diet thing we're all say i'm going to only eat clean and I buy all these vegetables, and all this food and then. I become overwhelmed and exhausted at the thought of like when it comes down to actually cooking all of these meals. That my family won't half of them because they're they're picky eaters and then I just get resentful and I go, for you know, a bag of processed food or whatever I do tend to go. almost exclusively for sugar. Like. Chocolate and candy and. And all that I don't tend to bend i'm not like one of those salty crunchy people. So I just am in this pattern of tomorrow i'm going to start the diet and then i'll overload on food and, of course, gain weight and then i'll. be good for a couple days. or even weeks and i'll start to lose a couple pounds and then i'll say all right now i'm going to take a break, because this is a lot and it's moving too slowly, and then i'll immediately gain the weight back so. I have been in that stuck pattern, and then I do the thing, where I start reading about nutrition and listening to podcasts about nutrition and. Like as you were saying I mean there's all this conflicting information and so i'll try different things and see if that works, and if that I mean i've done a lot of fasting and I don't know if that's I would be curious to talk to you about fasting because I feel like it's like. This thing that's really taken off and the."
120.0,Provider,Whole intermittent fasting thing.
15076.0,Patient,"Like they're all these these studies that show how good it is for your body, but I also and i've tried it and I think there are a lot of obviously pitfalls, so that you know, like it makes me really hungry and then i've been hardcore after some fasting."
120.0,Provider,that's the biggest yeah side effect of it is that it adds. Up to binge.
15076.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
120.0,Provider,"The other thing that it does is. It messes up your your body's metabolism, a little bit to where your body doesn't know what to expect, and so it tends to be more conservative and how you and how it uses calories. and because all of your body's processes use energy all the cells are constantly dividing and all of your White blood cells are fighting infections. and your red blood cells are moving energy and ATP around your body and oxygen all these different things, your hair is growing, you know your skin's producing oils all your body is doing stuff all the time, you know and it's like a big factory. And if all of a sudden it doesn't. have enough fuel to you know, to pay it to workers, so to speak, where to start quitting their life. So, so, then you know your hair doesn't grow as well, your skin gets dryer and you know you your your body doesn't work as well, along with your energy level of skills rare. Because it those those pieces of your body that need that fuel are not getting fed and so your body directs the energy to the most essential pieces. That does your heart and your lungs things like that, and like because your body is like i'd rather you lay there and not move and stay alive and have energy to move around. Right, so it can you know kind of creates depression, plus it increases anxiety because your body when it feels like it's in danger. You know your we call the caveman brain your caveman brain kicks in and it's like I gotta survive, you know so as it approaches the world. Like you're being chased by a tiger, because the world is not safe right now, because my body doesn't it doesn't feel safe because it's not getting what it needs. And so it'll cause your anxiety in general to be increased and cause you to think about food even more, because your body's like I gotta be I got to have food. I mean it's funny that people who are most balanced eaters don't think about food that much wow like they don't talk about it that much they're not talking about their diets are not like. You know, like that, if you sit around on a group of women, especially it's so annoying because everyone's talking about their with their dieting and it's like really. there's other things, and they were older more important than that, but people focus on it, and a lot of times because they don't it's an insecure attachment with food. So they're constantly worried about it. yeah but the fasting thing I mean that's what whatever you know benefits it has on insulin levels i've heard things like that too. And a dietitian would be the one to really answer that as far as that that piece, but what it does to you mentally I think is probably like, especially if you're already prone to you know connecting your worse with what you're eating. I think it's more risky. Because it like if you're somebody that doesn't really have an emotional attachment to food that much you know you might be able to do that kind of thing more safely. As far as without triggering a binge or without triggering guilt. or without triggering shame. But if you feel like you're good or you're bad if you're eating or not eating, then that can become quite a whirlwind of emotional stuff."
15076.0,Patient,Right right.
120.0,Provider,"So. You know, one of the best ways of what we usually try to teach in our programs is. You know, is it we always search for we always shoot for intuitive eating. Which is when you honor your hunger and your fullness you when you're hungry you eat when you're full you stop. And then you try to eat from a variety of food groups and you try to avoid getting overly hungry or overly full. yeah you know that's kind of the basics of it and you tried it when you're having an emotion you try to deal with the emotion. Apart from food, you have to kind of figure out what's food and what's what's tiredness or what's boredom or what I love, how you said that you use it as a way of kind of taking a break. yeah I used to always think about that because, like in my old job. You know, they would have you could you could have a smoke break and I was like what if what if you're not a smoker ya know like because i'm like I want to smoke break for non smokers. I don't smoke, but I would like to be able to go outside for 15 minutes and just shoot the breeze or go for a walk or something. Right, you know, but the only time you really like you gotta break is at lunch yeah lunch break. And so, then you feel like you're supposed to be eating. In order to justify having a break. yeah no I get that you know I get that like it feels like I have to be eating when I take a break or and also our society where we celebrate with food and we punish with you people go to bed without dinner. You know that there's a lot of emotional. You know attachments with food. yeah, and so it makes sense that you know when food might be the only time you ever actually relax. and enjoy yourself, is when you're watching movie and eating food or reading a book eating food. And so you're into it's like you're paired with that. Right so yeah. So so like like that's an example of an addictive pattern of this is how I feel good is when I do this. yeah but it's not because you're actually addicted to food it's your ticket to the process of it."
15076.0,Patient,Right right yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So um. Do you have any like health problems related to this, that you've been able to identify."
15076.0,Patient,"um you know well, I do have I have PC ios I don't have familiar, you are but I. think the statistic is like 70% of women with PCs are insulin resistant. And i'm having blood work done this week because I had my checkup last week. And i'm wondering if, like my son, I mean i'm 46 now, so I think a lot of my weight gain also has to do with just perimenopause but."
120.0,Provider,Her yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"Very weight gain is also a big side effect of PCs so. i'm curious to see how my blood work comes out it sugar again is like a is a bad mix with PC or less, I guess, in terms of insulin and weight gain and all that."
120.0,Provider,"No, I just. went to I have it right here, I went to a CEO or a little webinar just last week that was all about understanding PCs and eating disorder risk. interesting and you can see it, you can access it it's on the viewer look, if you want to look at it. And it talks about like it's geared towards clinicians therapists and dietitians but it, you know it would be you know definitely helpful for you know, a client to. You, but if you're interested in it it's. it's from Center for change, which is a treatment Center where i'm at i'm in utah. Okay, and so the website is www dot Center for change calm and then, if you scroll to the very, very end. there's, a thing that says a webinars."
15076.0,Patient,Oh okay.
120.0,Provider,"And if you click on that, then list the webinars that they have and that like post previous ones."
15076.0,Patient,Oh great.
120.0,Provider,"As well as current ones, and you can look at that if you want to it's like it's an hour little webinar."
15076.0,Patient,will be interesting.
120.0,Provider,yeah cuz I didn't I watched it and I thought it was pretty interesting too.
15076.0,Patient,yeah I think there's a higher rate of eating disorders to in people with PCs just because I think we.
120.0,Provider,"Well yeah because people try to manage you know there they get afraid of waking and. Progress around gets you know start lowering and stuff and so. It can affect a lot of things, but I mean something that I don't know a whole lot about it, but the person who presented sure did. and her and her information is on there, so you can always text or. email her if you have questions."
15076.0,Patient,yeah i'll be curious to check that out.
120.0,Provider,Her okay um and have you ever had any eating disorder specific type of treatment or this is kind of the first.
15076.0,Patient,"This is in in my early 20s I was going to overeaters anonymous for a couple of years and really enjoyed that I really liked the 12 step. Okay um and I identified with I mean obviously they were people meetings, who had you know pretty severe eating disorders, and again I feel like my. Binge eating disorder is what I basically have and. I don't know if that counts as treatment, but it was definitely like."
120.0,Provider,"yeah trying to understand a way of managing it kind of thing. But you have never seen it like a dietitian about it. kind of thing okay. i'm. screwed. All right, and then so right now, can you tell me a little bit about what your what your own average a week might look like and like you said that you. Try to do some clean eating and then you try to kind of get annoyed with that because it's hard it takes a lot of work to eat fresh all the time and. yeah so, then you cut her like screw it and you too much candy. I were."
15076.0,Patient,You I kind of do that I tend to I almost never eat breakfast.
120.0,Provider,Which.
15076.0,Patient,"is probably not a good habit. I i'm a stay at home stay at home mom my husband works at home full time the kids are gone during the day and I tend to be too impatient to like prepare an actual meal for myself so i'll graze a lot of the time already, like. On sometimes things like NUTS or cheese or things like that, but a lot of times it'll be like a big bowl of kettle corn, or you know I lately what i've started doing is buying candy and hiding it from everyone and just. Say hey there's been a lot of that lately. Okay um."
120.0,Provider,The tons of shame around it sounds like. Literally tons of shaming and secret.
15076.0,Patient,"And both my husband and I are really good at hiding all this from the kids because we don't want our kids to read. pete our own unhealthy patterns with food, so I literally will have like stuff hidden in my drawers you know that i'll go when i'm folding laundry i'll sneak in like somehow yeah. Exactly exactly I usually eat a pretty balanced homemade dinner and but during the day it's a lot of grazing on a combination of snack foods and. Healthy healthy healthier foods."
120.0,Provider,"Healthy stuff okay. yeah okay. um do you. But you did you do some restricting, though, like trying to eat, something you kind of go back and forth like."
15076.0,Patient,"gets a frantic about it lately yeah. Okay, good. Probably four years ago, I had a lot of success in terms of weight loss with intermittent fasting with fasting two days a week. I thought that was really working well for me both mentally and physically for about a year and a half and then. It stopped you know it was one of those."
120.0,Provider,"People can do that, like, I have a boss that in my old job that used to do that, but. You know, but she didn't seem to have the emotional issues associated with it, and she wasn't like it wasn't like that what she said in her life around you know."
15076.0,Patient,"And I think they became what I centered my life around and the emotional issues or what did me, and you know I started feeling stress. I am a big stress eater I also, this is probably important. have been diagnosed with. On the bipolar spectrum so i'm on. track to antidepressants in a mood stabilizer."
120.0,Provider,"Which which ones, what meds."

120.0,Provider,Since it is such a college thing.
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"But no, like diet pills things like that. huh okay."
15076.0,Patient,"I would, if I could you know it was like one of those if I have ever seen anything that I thought would have worked that I can get over the counter I would have been now."
120.0,Provider,"Oh yeah they don't work um. Alright, and medical complications, you have PC ios do you have anything that's because of that you can do you have like. Well, high blood pressure is not necessarily food related but, as do you have like blood pressure, problems or cardiac problems or. know your. thyroid things like that."
15076.0,Patient,One of the things i've been tested for. hypothyroidism. I have had high cholesterol in the past but i've managed to pretty much control that. yeah no not I mean just weight gain basically.

120.0,Provider,"Okay, and one was the highest."
15076.0,Patient,The highest was just a couple months ago. Probably the beginning of the summer.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and then one was like the lower the lower weight and 125 ish."
15076.0,Patient,um when I was in college and then also after I had my second child she was about a year old so that would have been. 11 years ago and I was also due to depression. I was diagnosed right after that so okay. had something to do with my weight gain a little bit as any depressants.
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah okay yeah well it's interesting because wellbutrin is one that i'm frequently reduces appetite.
15076.0,Patient,yeah that's why that's one of the reasons he. gave me well abuser was to sort of offset the side effects of the lexapro. And I think it helps like in terms of like sexual side effects and appetite I think it helps. A lot of my appetite at this point.
120.0,Provider,you're like I don't even know what.
15076.0,Patient,"I mean, I know, when I ravenous hungry if i've been fasting but other than that yeah."
120.0,Provider,"um, how do you feel about weight in general, like you, obsess about numbers, or do you more obsessed about what you but it looks like like what our body looks like or what it feels like like you feel your your body things like that."
15076.0,Patient,"And both lately it's more about look and feel because I now have like a fold on my stomach that I never had before you know, like."
120.0,Provider,"Okay yeah you're like hello, I didn't know you were there."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah yeah like a shelf. Where like I was underneath it and I and that freaks me out because that. First time that's ever happened really I mean. Right right right after I gave birth, it was like that, for a little bit, but. I was able to bring it back in."
120.0,Provider,All right.
15076.0,Patient,Really freaks me out i've never really had like. A lot of weight around my midsection and now I do. yeah I always was would gain weight mostly my legs and my you know in my bite and my legs and.

120.0,Provider,worried about it.
15076.0,Patient,Might not comfortable and my clothes and.
120.0,Provider,"Some pretty pretty bad body image right now you're pretty unhappy with the way that your body looks and feels. Very good now okay. All right, um do you have any particular food rules like I mean it sounds like you already feel like sugar is bad because you've kind of. mentioned that so sugar is kind of bad and do you have so it's carbs kind of the bad guys in your mind, for the most part."
15076.0,Patient,"You know what's the bad guy my mind, is more processed food. Okay, feel like. i've been pretty adamant about organic since my kids since I was pregnant, so I do what's what's funny is i'll do the thing, where I go to whole foods, I mean we buy almost all organic food, but all by like organic peanut butter cups and organic and be like. yeah like that, like it really doesn't make a difference, I think that it's organic but for some reason in my mind i'm like well it's a little bit better than."
120.0,Provider,Somehow it makes you feel better like. yeah. yeah yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah, so I think it's more about hope I. One thing i'm pretty actually very consistent about is I don't eat fast food our family doesn't eat fast food. Okay, except for will do in and out burger sometimes but. yeah we just."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. So, like when you do when you do binge you tend to buy kind of stuff ahead of time and it's having a house and graze on it. yeah like you go out and buy a whole bunch of food from drive through and like that."
15076.0,Patient,Right it's usually like oh run to trader joe's and get a bunch of you know.
120.0,Provider,Organic peanut butter Cup.
15076.0,Patient,Organic teas over yeah.
120.0,Provider,Right right okay.

120.0,Provider,"Okay, and then, as far as like a psych history, you mentioned some depression and possibly bipolar. Spectrum a little bit you said Okay, and have you been diagnosed with major depression depression, then or the day give you a specific diagnosis."
15076.0,Patient,"I think in my chart the diagnosis is bipolar slash major depressive. My medication has been pretty successful I mean, I still have bouts of depression um but."
120.0,Provider,"Because you can have bipolar to which is where you. You get you know sad and then kind of like less sad and then you know, like kind of normal and sad kind of but it's not like eagle manic where you get really hyper and really impulsive and things like that."
15076.0,Patient,"Exactly, I think I think i'm more but definitely not bipolar one because i've never had. Like a true manic but I when I first started in a depressants ssri as I did start to go a bit manic."
120.0,Provider,sort of okay. I romantic romantic.
15076.0,Patient,"Which is one of the reasons that they put me on limit all. Right so. And, and you know I think I sometimes have bipolar manic episodes but with the medication it feels like it's pretty under control, but i've. Not lately about the. Self care mental health spiritual health i've not been good about that lately, so I."
120.0,Provider,Think time for yourself yeah.
15076.0,Patient,Exactly part of the food sharing yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, because it is easier to to eat an organic peanut butter Cup, and it is to you know take time to clear your mind and meditate or connect with the earth, or whatever you do to help Center yourself."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,For sure um do you have like do you have any anxiety or ptsd. or like that.
15076.0,Patient,No ptsd I actually didn't have a did not have what I would call it traumatic I had a nice home life growing up. um but definitely have anxiety for sure. So and and food again is something is a go to for me for.
120.0,Provider,them yeah yeah for sure okay um. alright. Have you ever been suicidal.
15076.0,Patient,And i've experienced suicidal excuse me ideation. Not to the point where I made a plan. And that was like right when I was first diagnosed.
120.0,Provider,And that could have been postpartum to.
15076.0,Patient,I think a lot of it was.
120.0,Provider,postpartum is pretty darn common.
15076.0,Patient,It is it isn't I feel like it takes a lot of different forms and it's hard to recognize sometimes.
120.0,Provider,"that's for sure that is for sure. Do you ever engage in like self harm behaviors like hurting yourself on purpose like cutting burning and things like that okay. What about substance abuse has that ever been a problem for you, with alcohol or drugs."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah i've gotten. That in 21 is mostly stops drinking and he. My husband actually has been sober for seven years. And I was getting into a pattern sort of similar and it can seem to go hand in hand with eating I would feel like it, I would drink too much have too much wine, and then I would get ravenous the hungry and just binge horrible pattern that I was in, and so I read a couple of books on. Going alcohol free and i've been mostly alcohol free and 2021 and, for me, I seem to be one of those people it's just better for me not to drink at all like. yeah having like one glass of wine, I want three or four glasses. Right right, I definitely saw that going in a bad direction. And I think in some ways the food is kind of replace a little bit."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it can do that he says, which we joke about playing whack a mole with addictive patterns, you know we kind of jumped around and what we're doing to what our current drug of choices."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah totally.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so so alcohol used to be a problem, but you feel like a 21 you've kind of tampered that down pretty well any other substances like marijuana any any history of any of that, I mean sometimes people. play around with it a little bit, but."
15076.0,Patient,"Okay, no, no, I mean i've you know i've done marijuana recreationally occasionally but it's not ever been."
120.0,Provider,Not not really a thing.
15076.0,Patient,And you know it actually wasn't a thing until the last like five years. So. paul's definitely a more recent.
120.0,Provider,"Recent yeah. It could be related yeah but the food thing it definitely could be in the same category as that sounds like to try to cope with feelings yeah. For sure um and then is there any mental health or addiction patterns in your family, I mean you mentioned your husband having some food problems too, but what about like your your parents or grandparents."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah there's alcoholism in the family, I think my mom is an alcoholic."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
15076.0,Patient,"I noticed but i'm pretty sure she is. Depression and bipolar on both sides of the family. Actually bipolar and one side and then depression on both sides, so. With grandparents aunts uncles okay all right."
120.0,Provider,So there's a pretty good collection of that going on to you and you're currently living with your husband and your two kids you mentioned having an 11 year old.
15076.0,Patient,"And know, I have a 12 year old and a 14 year old."
120.0,Provider,"yo to Okay, I heard you say 11 years ago yeah."
15076.0,Patient,One when I was. Okay yeah.
120.0,Provider,"that's why I love it in my head, rather than a 14 year olds are the girls boys."
15076.0,Patient,One boy.
120.0,Provider,One girl on because it was the 14 year old.
15076.0,Patient,"My son Sam. Can he actually this is tied into the eating in many ways, he was tight diagnosed, three years ago with type one diabetes."
120.0,Provider,Oh okay.
15076.0,Patient,"um he was it was really serious he was hospitalized for. Very is yeah and both my husband's in my eating got worse at that point, and then it makes because it's stressful um. yeah and it also makes food, a huge focal point in the family, because."
120.0,Provider,i'm gonna have to.
15076.0,Patient,"know you have to anytime you need anything with carbohydrates, you have to dose with insulin so food now is even more of a like Okay, how many carbohydrates, are in that. yeah we work really hard not to restrict his diet, because we were told, he can eat whenever he wants, as long as we dose properly for it, but the reality is is blood sugar is much more stable when he's not eating sweets."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15076.0,Patient,But it is another you know reason. Food yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Sure, and that's a tough one, because you do have to make it a centerpiece of your life because you have to meet you know he's got to manage that his whole life. yeah you know so it's hard to figure out how do you manage it, without making it become like a religion, so to speak, you know where it's like a super centered down that that. Center for change website that I just told you about what that webinar there's a gallon Quinn nystrom, I think, and she does a lot of presentations about diabetes and eating disorders."
15076.0,Patient,Oh OK.
120.0,Provider,"OK she's diabetic and her brother is too, and so, and I think she has a presentation on there if she doesn't have the one from last time she recorded on there, I know she's doing one soon, because I saw an email come out about it so."
15076.0,Patient,"Well, that sounds like a great website really."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah and Quinn i'll I know it's Quinn nystrom, I think, let me just."
15076.0,Patient,yeah eating disorders and diabetes are very common together. Right play for girls.
120.0,Provider,"let's see if I can find this. yeah. It says it has her as a politician, I guess that's what she has to. Like I didn't I didn't know that she was that did that but. Diabetes advocate. Anyway, she's you can kind of look up look her up if you want, but."
15076.0,Patient,Look her up yeah.
120.0,Provider,But I got to hear her speak at a. An eating disorder conference and she's pretty good speaker and. Like the book she wrote if I kiss you will I get diabetes. that's the name of the book that you.
15076.0,Patient,write that down okay.
120.0,Provider,"Anyway, that's a good one, to look at. Okay um yeah and um so a little bit more about your your childhood where your parents together. growing up. And pretty pretty decent childhood, even though your mom has an alcohol problems."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah and I feel like that's really materialized until she was older. Okay josh probably in her 40s. Okay, and yeah it was a really my my family life was great we did have. economic insecurity. You were on food stamps when I was little and that probably helped. With my eating fixation on eat like I remember going to the grocery store and you know, to ask for like fruit roll ups and my mom would say we can't afford that no."
120.0,Provider,Right yeah. there's some scarcity stuff.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah so and then her definitely associated you know, like going out to a restaurant, is a very special thing that you know was."
120.0,Provider,very exciting for the family.
15076.0,Patient,"You know, having treats was was an exciting thing, so I think I equate food with."
120.0,Provider,Like celebration and. yeah yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah we. moved a lot, and that was really hard on me psychologically, I think, with anxiety and worry I switched schools, a lot. So that and then eating also became like a comfort at that point."
120.0,Provider,"Right yep because that was a secure thing that was a constant thing. Right make sense, do you. have a good relationship with your family your parents and stuff."
15076.0,Patient,"I have a good really good relationship with my mom i've been Okay, they divorced after. I finished college um. So I haven't okay relationship with my dad I have a really good relationship with my mom."
120.0,Provider,"All right, just at length."
15076.0,Patient,I have a younger brother who. i'm not super close with but it's not we don't you know we're not strange. We just started right really close yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Okay. All right. Did you go to you went What did you study in college. Do you do you work in that now, or that oh you're set your your mom."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah and after college, I worked. In entertain I worked at Warner brothers, I did not work in English. But i'm still have to read."
120.0,Provider,"All right, i'm just looking to see the things I still need to know Oh, what about like your your supports like do you have very many friends are like girlfriends you hang out with people you talk to you."
15076.0,Patient,yeah I do have a nice girlfriends yeah.
120.0,Provider,Do they tend to do any of them know that you shall with food stuff.
15076.0,Patient,We talked about that that's a common common topic. Right yeah.
120.0,Provider,yeah okay. And you said that you didn't really experience any abuse or neglect.
15076.0,Patient,know.
120.0,Provider,per se or in in college about your pretty any significant traumatic events from your past that you think influenced any of your ways of doing stuff.
15076.0,Patient,"No, I actually like really like i've never had any like sexual assault or."
120.0,Provider,"Good good it might be when you mentioned the kind of the some of the you know not having food not having a lot of security, I think that that definitely can add to kind of our beliefs about food and how food and food becomes kind of the calming presence or the. yeah you've kind of turned towards money you know for emotional regulation, so it might not definitely could be affecting it. yeah but i'm. Financially currently do you have what you need like food guys."
15076.0,Patient,"You okay you're comfortable financially. yeah we when we first got married me we're not so we're really at a point where, where we are."
120.0,Provider,yeah that's.
15076.0,Patient,Good yeah.
120.0,Provider,And do you have any hobbies anything fun that you do that for yourself.
15076.0,Patient,"I it's funny I mean this is part of my issue and that I need to work on therapies I don't give myself a lot of permission I. You know movies and reading have always been big things that I love to do, I do love spending time with friends. But I haven't. taken time to really. spend time on what I enjoy doing or even being in touch with what I enjoy doing."
120.0,Provider,yeah and that and that could be a big focus of therapy to for you is engaging and things that bring joy into the just using food as a numbing kind of. halfway and now is creating a life for yourself that you don't need to know from maybe. other ways of. kind of relaxing so.
15076.0,Patient,Right right.
120.0,Provider,"Okay well that's kind of all the the. questions that I had for you so basically um it sounds like what you're saying is, is why I think he definitely you know could qualify for budgeting diagnosis. has been going on for a while and there's been weight changes and you feel like it takes up a big part of your mental bandwidth in a day to day basis. And I think though that your your sounds like you said you haven't really done any kind of treatment for this as far as specifically for this problem, you know outpatient probably would be you know would be. It would make sense to do and expected, so I think what we'll do is. If you say, well, you are I don't know your therapist now that you work with off and on and they I don't know if they know anything about eating disorders have i'm know some, but we could always have you meet with one of ours and a dietitian. kind of get those pieces setup and that probably be your best that's what I would recommend that you do."
15076.0,Patient,yeah that's what I was kind of envisioning yeah.
120.0,Provider,And a dietitian and the therapist actually could even do some family stuff to with your whole family about ways of approaching food and it's like that too.
15076.0,Patient,"We definitely would be interested in that as well, so they only sessions or oh great."
120.0,Provider,"Great yeah the therapist for sure, well, but we can always do you know they can do it like a dietitian can do that to you know work with like. You know, educate the whole family, I mean it's some of its going to have to be you know, obviously age appropriate because you don't want to, because the kids aren't going to know the same things that you don't you're gonna know. Because they're not gonna they're gonna be like well you know good just developmentally they won't be as interested in that usually. But they definitely can do that for you, too, so."
15076.0,Patient,awesome yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,And we. We do have a free support group every other every other Saturday if you're at all interested.
15076.0,Patient,Oh okay.
120.0,Provider,i'm I i'm involved in I run it every other time and the dietitian runs it every other time so.
15076.0,Patient,How many people are at the group usually is it.
120.0,Provider,About yeah you just about five or six that are that are consistently there.
15076.0,Patient,is pretty small.
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah but it's an hour and a half it's it starts its early California at 730 California time.
15076.0,Patient,"Okay, on Saturdays."
120.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah and you would just come to the virtual clinic which is like where you came in today to get the room number that I gave you wrong and. And then, and then you just it's free everything like that so. Okay, and I will actually be doing it, this weekend so. Okay, if that's something that you are."
15076.0,Patient,yeah I think I would be interested I don't think my husband would but yeah.
120.0,Provider,yeah well it's interesting to meet other people and to learn about other people's stories and.
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,How you're not the only one.
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah okay.
120.0,Provider,All right.
15076.0,Patient,So what's The next step will just wait to hear.
120.0,Provider,"So yeah i'll just get back to amanda and let her know that I think you'd be great I think we could help you and that you're kind of you know that you're open to therapist and dietitian and that support group. yeah and that you don't really need I op. Right now. yeah but and I don't know if you have you because it's it's from. three to six California time Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. So I don't even know if you."
15076.0,Patient,I O p.
120.0,Provider,yeah si O p.
15076.0,Patient,"Okay, and then. In terms of time for treatment like is it a set for the. Like for the outpatient that I would be doing. Instead of the intensive outpatient um is that over a span of just until you feel like you're ready to be."
120.0,Provider,"done yeah usually kind of what we usually do is kind of shoot for like every other week for a bit. I mean sorry sorry every week for a bit. Okay, and did you see both of them every week for a little bit and then as you're feeling like yeah I got this i'm understanding some of this i'm practicing some of these new behaviors. then go to every other week and then maybe like once a month, and then you know kind of whatever is comfortable for you. there's no like hard and fast rule. Okay, about how it works."
15076.0,Patient,"And, in the meantime, do you recommend because, like I said i'm a reader do you recommend intuitive eating. Yes, Okay, because I wanted to read that never happen yeah okay."
120.0,Provider,"So yeah that's a really good one and then that there's a book called sick enough, which is a really good one, too, and that one's particularly about eating disorders, for people in normal size bodies. Because frequent people who have a larger size body say well i'm not that sick I don't i'm not underweight. But you know I just need to lose weight, but they don't understand the same behaviors that you're doing. If somebody in a lower size body was doing that they would say oh they're anorexic or whatever, or they like it's just an interesting you know, like bias against larger size body so anyway it's a that's a good one, too. Another good one is life without ED and and as well yeah we the eating disorder. And without one she she started before restriction and binge purging. But it's the same idea of you know your mind saying that you're bad or you're good if you eat something it helps you understand, like the mental process of it, so those three books, I think, are both are all pretty good okay great. So okay all right."
15076.0,Patient,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate your time."
120.0,Provider,you're welcome i'm glad we can make it work today so.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah all right. All right, see you later."
120.0,Provider,"Okay bye bye. Alright, so for diagnosis, will do bipolar to. generalized anxiety disorder and binge eating disorder and that we recommend. outpatient. therapy and outpatient dietitian sessions and yeah I think that's it."
