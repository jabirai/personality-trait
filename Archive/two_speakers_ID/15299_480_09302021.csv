480.0,Provider,Christine it's nice to meet you.
15299.0,Patient,We talked a little bit. Last Tuesday.
480.0,Provider,yeah in group right. Oh you're muted. There you go. Last Tuesday.
15299.0,Patient,yeah it was my first group.
480.0,Provider,"Have you been doing since then, is the medication working okay."
15299.0,Patient,"yeah was until I got my prescription I tried to get my prescription filled yesterday and I need a prior authorization yep prior authorization and the pharmacy department is telling me, it could take up to five day."
480.0,Provider,Oh no so you don't have any at all. Oh that's not good. yeah. The pharmacy department through bright heart or your actual pharmacist to saying that.
15299.0,Patient,The third bright heart.
480.0,Provider,And I know that I was pregnant.
15299.0,Patient,But. I don't know they said that the turnaround can be five days.
480.0,Provider,"i'll see if I can sometimes speed that up i'm going to put an increase in your chart So how have you been dealing with the pregnancy, did you ever follow up with. An. appointment."
15299.0,Patient,"I had an appointment last Thursday, for an ultrasound I found out that I was 15 weeks and three days. I have an appointment scheduled Saturday to talk about an abortion, I believe it's. $840 but I qualify for a little bit of financial assistance. i'm just unsure what i'm going to do right now."
480.0,Provider,It kind of leaning more towards the abortion you don't think it's a good idea to have a baby right now.
15299.0,Patient,"Oh well, with me i'm a three year old and a seven month old not particularly. i'm just scared nervous, you know i've never been through that before. don't really know what to think. That really know what to think about myself. But."
480.0,Provider,"Well okay so let's process that a little bit because most of the time when people feel guilt and shame about the decision it's not coming from inside it's coming from outside messages like society religion parents fears all of that so as long as. You haven't told her. yeah. that's understandable, I feel like the best thing that you can do is make a decision that you feel like is healthy for you. Because that's, the only way you're going to not regret whatever decision to."
15299.0,Patient,Right. So.
480.0,Provider,"I mean it's a big decision, but also, you have to remember that if you decide to go through with it it's because you're putting. Your well being your needs your other kids needs first."
15299.0,Patient,"It is a big decision, like my first appointment there there's protesters. Outside I can hear them the whole time I was in such and. Such awful yeah. They have another location that doesn't have protesters and stuff. is pretty much like that everywhere nowadays."
480.0,Provider,"it's so sad, I was surprised I went to two different planned parenthood's when I lived in Florida, and neither of them. Had protesters, they were all like in a medical complex, and I was hoping Maybe it was like that everywhere now but I guess not."
15299.0,Patient,Not around.
480.0,Provider,So babies dad is here boyfriend. Has man.
15299.0,Patient,Well yeah legends of isn't. The greatest.
480.0,Provider,explain why like what's going on with the relationship.
15299.0,Patient,is just. abusive. physically. physically mentally burly.
480.0,Provider,No.
15299.0,Patient,"I don't want to be in the situation that i'm in but i'm kind of stuck right now, as far as not having anywhere else to go."
480.0,Provider,Is he the dad of your other kids. Okay.
15299.0,Patient,"But he doesn't see them my mom has custody of my first kid and then I have the seven month old but he's good with her, you know he's just. What he wants to be with her when he wants to be with her and that's it yeah."
480.0,Provider,everything's on his time and his convenience. right which is probably also how the relationship is right. everything's about him and his needs and his convenience.
15299.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly."
480.0,Provider,How long have you been with him.
15299.0,Patient,i'm about five years. Every time i've left this one. Is.
480.0,Provider,"easy to do, though, the problem is to get comfortable in that situation and then it's easy to go back to it. it's your relationship like, with your mom he said she has your oldest."
15299.0,Patient,it's good when i'm not with him. yeah she doesn't like him because of the physical abuse which. I completely understand. That when he is not in the picture this good. really good I mean she's never tried to keep me away from my daughter or anything like that. mean he is the reason that I don't have custody of her which is. awful but.
480.0,Provider,He literally not have custody.
15299.0,Patient,"yeah it it all happened kind of crazy okay um you know DSS got involved because there was drugs in my system when I was pregnant with her and, but when she was born, you know she was clean and her umbilical cord was clean, so I had like a. Like a supervised custody. And then that turned into me and him having her. And then me and him got in a fight and he put his hands on me my mom picked me up and rushed me to our lawyers office and everything happened so fast I didn't realize that she was taking custody away from me."
480.0,Provider,that's.
15299.0,Patient,that's yeah that's where that and.
480.0,Provider,So how often is he physical with you.
15299.0,Patient,"is to not be too much, but like I don't know lately it's kind of gotten worse, I would say."
480.0,Provider,Do you. feel safe around him like do you ever feel like you're scared for your life.
15299.0,Patient,"For my life just. scared for myself in general, you know. he's never. Like."
480.0,Provider,Really.
15299.0,Patient,"need this amount of me, but you know and enough is enough choking me and slapping me around is. The severe really changed things for me yeah."
480.0,Provider,And you currently live with him. What do you think you said. That you don't really have anywhere else to go if you were to leave him do you think your mom would.
15299.0,Patient,Let you.
480.0,Provider,stay with her with the baby.
15299.0,Patient,"yeah she was just there's her my dad. I thought that was. The goal it's her and my dad and my daughter, and then they have custody of two of my nephews those all have. been trying to find for me to yeah. it's doable it's just really stressful and they're both alcoholics really bad. yeah. It doesn't help my recovery that much which outdoors never really been an issue for me, but you know. Sometimes we're not doing started drinking one thing leads to another and. Other things are involved."
480.0,Provider,So what was your main drug of choice was the opiates or math.
15299.0,Patient,"It was opiates at first, you know heroin and then, when I started getting off that and being consistent with my subjects it went to cocaine and then it went Smith. I just kind of replaced one or another. yeah without even realizing it, and when I did realize it is."
480.0,Provider,"easy to do because that's The thing is, people don't realize that the reason we become addicts is because it's meeting a need, we have you know whether it's like. taking care of pain or emotional pain, most of the time anxiety depression, so when you put one down unless you have something to replace it like therapy support system network all of that. it's really easy. To just find another way to self medicate."
15299.0,Patient,"Right. Honestly, I think my. mirror the level it is if I work with if I wasn't with him."
480.0,Provider,yeah is that. A man. bring it home. He.
15299.0,Patient,He is always doing it and it's always there he doesn't force it on me or anything it's just you know i'm an addict and being around it is not easy. Especially being being stuck in the House is him and.
480.0,Provider,That would be hard to do not blame my.
15299.0,Patient,"addiction him by any means, but."
480.0,Provider,Oh no. But I get it it's really hard. In recovery to and until I literally got rid of.
15299.0,Patient,All of the old people in my life I couldn't stay sober.
480.0,Provider,Because it's too hard to be around. Like what's your daily life look like.
15299.0,Patient,Except for when I go to my mom my daughter. I can't even go to the store. yeah he's in court right now it's just pretty much the only reason i'm able to talk the way that I am. Just driving with license revoked. Serious but. yeah.
480.0,Provider,be supportive of you making whatever decision is best for you.
15299.0,Patient,"His first words were abortion, which you know I understand because that's what i'm leaning towards to. But. If I were to have a baby he wouldn't. Like. Shame me for it, I guess you know, he would be there to a degree. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and who knows if you're even going to be with him by the time the baby's born."
15299.0,Patient,yeah that.
480.0,Provider,sounds like you know he's probably not super healthy for you it's just trying to figure out a way to get out of it.
15299.0,Patient,"yeah Oh, I definitely know that he's not just like you said, if I feel stuck. And then, when i'm not stuck and i'm not with them it's like i'm trying to find a way back back there. And not not realizing and not remembering how bad things were yeah."
480.0,Provider,that's the unfortunate part of having an addict is it's really easy to forget the pain and focus on like a couple of good times. yeah drugs with man with everything.
15299.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so, since this is our first therapy session. I do have to ask you charge for suicide risk, do you. Think about."
15299.0,Patient,No. I don't think i've ever really been suicidal depressed yeah but never to the point of one to take my life.
480.0,Provider,Sometimes it gets marked whenever there's. Like Have you ever had an accidental overdose.
15299.0,Patient,No God never had an overdose or an accidental one.
480.0,Provider,"Because usually if people are struggling with suicidal ideation We just have to make a safety plan, but if that's not an issue for you and."
15299.0,Patient,When wouldn't even know where to begin take him home life i'd be too scared.
480.0,Provider,"yeah. So safety, though, as far as with your boyfriend do you have a safety plan of stuff starts to escalate really bad like is it easy for you to get the baby out of the House."
15299.0,Patient,"yeah and I actually have a car key hidden. Good Okay, I can get. off of that I have to think like that, but."
480.0,Provider,"it's not awful that's the thing so part of the work I do with you is trying to. Get you to stop judging how you feel thinking act right because shame and guilt or the core of any addiction any mental illness, so the more we can have compassion and grace towards ourselves instead of judging our feelings our thoughts all of that, the easier. It is to work towards healing so you don't have to feel bad for being in the situation you're in it's practical in your situation to have a hidden key you know what I mean so. let's look at it like that, instead of feeling bad for even having to do that think about Oh, thank God, I have enough knowledge to know to have an exit plan. Because that really is key, with any recovery it's just changing your inner dialogue, so the way that we talk to ourselves is typically the most toxic relationship we have. Because we're mean are to ourselves than anybody else so part of recovery is trying to talk to ourselves, like like i'm my own best friend right So when I start having. These thoughts I try to counter the thoughts with things I would say to my best friend would say to me. Half the stuff I tell myself."
15299.0,Patient,yeah. Sorry. We.
480.0,Provider,"didn't they stay, they were going to follow up with you when they figured out the pharmacy issue because i'm looking in. Your chart. replan about it, yes."
15299.0,Patient,"yeah they said to follow. All of them. said, they say, when it was. done, they said that I could call them back at the rx department. But all they really said was the turnaround would be five days."
480.0,Provider,You have enough money to pay out of pocket within two. Days. Like using a good. thing.
15299.0,Patient,"Just to get through, so you said. yeah I can do that if I had."
