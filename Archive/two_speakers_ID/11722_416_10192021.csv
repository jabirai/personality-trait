416.0,Provider,Good my headsets not connected hold on one SEC. know how.
11722.0,Patient,you're done.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, there we go."
11722.0,Patient,it's like so smooching with my dog so.
416.0,Provider,that's a legitimate excuse. yeah they're good meters so kyle we had. We had the way we laughed it off before was that you were going to contact your insurance to do that level of care assessment.
11722.0,Patient,"Yes, they took some time to get back to me um took the assessment. and Really didn't. feel like I needed to go. do anything after that so."
416.0,Provider,"Now i'm confused, but he may need to really didn't feel like he needed to go do anything after that."
11722.0,Patient,"Actually that's that's that's a lie i'm sorry i'm like halfway, can I just just tried to lie to you, they took some time to get back to me. And at that point, I am just kind of was lost interest in doing the whole thing altogether and i've been feeling pretty good since then, nonetheless, and. yeah so at this point I just didn't do it so don't really think I need to go to some impatient thing so."
416.0,Provider,"Well, it wasn't necessarily Inpatient it could have been intensive outpatient. or partial hospitalization all right, I mean there's lots of different that's why they were going to do the level of care assessment so you didn't follow up on it is, but it comes down to you hmm."
11722.0,Patient,"Not after that, no, no, no, and yeah. So."
416.0,Provider,Are you so are you still seeing your individual therapist.
11722.0,Patient,"Yes, I am still seeing the individual therapist."
416.0,Provider,How often are you seeing happen.
11722.0,Patient,"yeah he's a great guy he's nice he's just considered a talk therapist that makes that's different or anything I don't know but i'm not like him i've been doing good actually in pretty high spirits lately i'm just sound a little down out of it now, because I just woke up. and yeah I. Applied to recruiting agencies, I did an interview with the. recruiter i've been applying to jobs. You know my unemployment send it I could have tried to go on disability. You know, whatever you'd call it, you know, and I just feel like that's kind of copying out. So. yeah I haven't really been feeling too hopeless or or anything like that lately, it was area that the as unemployment was getting closer and closer to ending it was getting more. Heavy on my you know, on my mind, you know, like what's going to happen, what am I going to do it kind of felt like the the. If I can come up with a quick. What do you call it like metaphor something was kind of like it, the life but life raft I was floating on this losing air if that makes sense and it's like okay what am I going to do you know, like I don't know so it was pretty. distressing but. I was only thinking that because they've just was being you know it was being lazy and I didn't want to go try to get a job and whatnot um. But for the most part, things have been good enough lately that i've been you know feeling very well I haven't had any real episodes as far as I know. You have any questions."
416.0,Provider,"know so but let's talk about how to move forward. So. um I mean based on what you're saying and sounds like you've experienced some improvement you haven't been seeing me because we were going to refer you out. And, before I was seeing you once every week and we weren't seeing any improvement during that time so. Which is why we had decided to so it sounds like since then you've got some improvement. And you're still seeing your individual therapist so what that's going to look like from our end, then, since you already have a therapist is that all see you once every three months every quarter for a check in. And i'll See you in group. But then, all see you every quarter and that's assuming you want to continue with bright heart."
11722.0,Patient,"yeah thing is I I like I like meeting with you, so I like meeting with every I like meeting with the with Philip I, like my group sessions um if anything I liked them so much that I I. would miss them, you know what I you know what I mean. yeah so that was the real thing about doing the Inpatient and whatnot was that these these things, these thesis. Times, I was having were. ones I enjoyed that, if anything, when I was losing, but I could sit here for so many reasons say I don't have desire for this don't have desire for that these are things I desire to do. And they made me happy to attend and to do so, you know not having appointments you know with us, often or whatnot was upsetting because it was like Okay, I really liked these really felt nice to talk, you know and. it's you know just taps have human engagement so. that's something that I, that I. Really liked, and it was done in a in a way that was convenient and, if anything, that the focus was on things that were important to me and whatnot that I could. In a sense, relate to you know and and feel free you'll feel open discussing which is really nice. You know, then of course these and it's like Okay, who do you wants to listen to me talk about this stuff you know but. that's not always it's not always necessary it's not like I need to spend every day talking about it but um i've also built relationships with people you know, like you, and and others in group and whatnot which is extended to a an extracurricular thing that I can you know. engage with and interact with them, you know so there's been moments, where I felt very good, you know, like I mentioned in our. chat on discord that I created I mentioned to everyone that I finally been awarded rent relief through the state. And the lady that the REP that that helped me of our case where she was incredible and in the end we got like $16,000 to help with the back rent and everything no it's not additional money is money I technically old. She was trying to give me like $30,000 based on what I put down, but I stayed actually written in the information correctly, but she gave us 8000 for a rears the past to rent and then another 8000 so towards future rent up through December. and help with utilities and whatnot and it was very it was awesome so that's one thing that was very daunting for me that I accomplished. And I did all the work with that since since May or March is when I started working with that. Anyway, I had. I had shared that information on on discord and. You know, James said had reached out to me, you know right away he's like man, I need to do this, you know I need to do this right away, this is a. Something that's been bothering me, you know, and so I said hey contact, and so we spoke sat in my living room I spoke on the phone with them, you know for about an hour and a half, two hours you know, and I. got to do that to be the type of person I like, which is a similar position to you how you and I engage or got to sit there and tell you man you bought this you know, like let's here's what you need to do like. Like it was daunting to me too I didn't know what. Where to start but it's not that hard you know so what's your situation blah blah blah Oh, this is perfect, this is perfect, this is great duty just. Unfortunately, just have to do it, you know and fill it out, you know and it's okay that takes this long and. You know, we chatted for well well over well over an hour. And it wasn't just about that it was about a lot of you know, personal stuff too like he happens to be very into computers and i'm very into computers and music and we started changing music back and forth, and you know really established a cool a. what's the word i'm looking for. more depth more depth. To work. Our friendship, you know. You know, a couple days later he he was so excited that he actually completed it and he writes me and he's like I could have done it without you. You know, and then you know. Speaking with Leonard you know gabby you know and things like that the people on there are happy and establishing you know friendship and whatnot so that's a helps i'm. Being a Moderator of the discourse helps. help me feel like i'm doing my old type of stuff again, you know, I was the one who, who I felt like was the first one to reach out to these you know to people outside and say like hey if you want someone. You know chatter talk to hit me up, and the reason for that was is that is that you know, speaking with another counselor I had always hoped. That, if I was in a group situation, especially one in person like we talked about you know more like a like an in person, one that I would. meet people that would help lift me up when i'm down that would meet other men or even women that would say hey man, what are you doing you can't I can't let you stay inside all day you know i'm going to come pick you up let's go do something type of that type of thing you know and. So I wanted to extend that virtually and I was one who. had thought about the whole idea of you know chat on let's create like a chat room or place to go and I talked to him about it and. Immediately you know he went in took it upon himself herself hit their themself to create a discord and is messaging me what's which. We name it what should be what should you know what should this be what should that be, what should this should happy. And I was very kind and helpful in helping them but inside I was going man i'm kind of bummed because this is my idea. This is something I wanted to do, and this is an opportunity for me to a learn how to do some stuff with this program that I haven't done before. And I was the one who really initiated all this, I kind of want ownership of it, I was, I was upset you know, I was like this is this was really my thing my idea my baby, you know and. I know you liked it so much you just jumped on to you know to doing it, but he was a wonderful person and actually messaged him and at one point said hey. This is how I feel down and."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
11722.0,Patient,"They felt so bad, they put you know and ended up immediately like making me a moderator and I was like, no, no, you didn't have to do that. I just wanted to share with you how I felt if I was you know, so I wanted to get it off my chest, and I feel like it's um it's not a good feeling way to think I actually think I should be thankful that you did this, I should be thankful that that blah blah blah just feel a little. Like like i'm missing out on on the experience of setting everything up and learning the full moderation part of it that I wanted to have. And I said well both both both moderated it, and so, then I hopped on there and I got to do a lot of stuff that I really like to do, which was like setting up rules for everybody, and you know and just all these little things you get to do in the program That was really nice. Okay, you know and that book good so i'm just trying to catch you up real quick and. yeah things things are pretty good so you know I would be upset to lose to lose up that time with you, I feel like it's still very helpful. meeting you mean and."
416.0,Provider,"Well, so well."
11722.0,Patient,person I started with one off tangent but I kind of just.
416.0,Provider,So I won't be seeing you every week or even every month i'll be seeing you every three months.
11722.0,Patient,Why is that.
416.0,Provider,"Because if you, though, the way that we would view this is because you have an outside their best if it temporarily when you were in crisis, both of us could see you, but if you need so much therapy that you're needing to see both of us, then you need a higher level of care. So if you're saying that you're feeling pretty good and you don't need a higher level of care, then you should be fine with once weekly therapy. With your therapist. Does that make sense. And then you're getting group, in addition to that."
11722.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So so we'll make sure that we schedule out each quarter, so that we have something on the books and then i'll just check in with you, and if at some point you don't see your if, like if you. Your therapist moves away or something, and you weren't seeing him anymore, and then i'll be kind of waiting in the wings but um but yeah that's not so."
11722.0,Patient,"That is just. As a personal question, though I mean like no I have insurance is covering this but. You see, on TV, the person sitting on the on the little flat couch with their hands folded on their chest they're talking to the that you know the therapist and know the cliche cliche chat with their count like you know their therapy following me. Along you see that people pay for that can be paid for as much as they want it's a service they're paying for, and I mean if I if I want it can't I get it or is it because i'm kind of going through insurance needs to be. not specified type thing."
416.0,Provider,"And well there is such a thing as medical necessity for sure. All our insurance and and then it's a private pay might be different, but medical necessity but also part of our program is that we just aren't like a. You know easygoing we're we're like a treatment program right we're trying to get you to meet your therapeutic goals and like kind of get there. And so we develop individual strategies with people around that but because we are a program and not just individual therapy it's not there's a, there is the medical necessity. Competitive program as well."
11722.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah I would I would assume so, especially since it's been paid through you know medical or whatnot I mean if I was. just thinking of that from outside standing outside the box I go well, they don't want to pay for people that just. have somebody to talk to, but that's really you know that the chatting with people's making me feel better so there's a chance that not meeting with you as much I would be. impacted by that I will tell you i'm impacted by by the times i've missed. missed my sessions, you know i've been very upset at myself and whatnot for not having those meetings um you know but."
416.0,Provider,"Obviously, but again kyle if you're at the point where you need. It I mean in in a very temporary sense to get you kind of stabilized that's one thing, and you know we can increase the frequency, but once you're stabilized but you're saying that you are. there's you know if you need more than once weekly that you're getting from your outside provider therapy plus once weekly group that's twice a week you're being seen and then you need a higher level of care. So um, so we will schedule out for quarterly check in so we'll do that I should we do that, right now, if you want um. And then the The other thing is kyle we're not getting. Surveys from you so i'm not able. to monitor."
11722.0,Patient,Every single week every every single Monday I do my surveys every single Monday i've never missed a survey ever.
416.0,Provider,No i'm not kidding i'm from you.
11722.0,Patient,that's that's absolutely correct I do my students.
416.0,Provider,Are you doing. So I see some of them I see some of them in here. Not. i'm not seeing your dad seven in your pH Q. nine are you.
11722.0,Patient,"Doing only have one minute hold you have one survey in that case I only do va is at seven, the one that that sounds like a month that asking you a drug addiction it's like help you know how how many times this week, did you do crap how many times a week, did you do."
416.0,Provider,This aren't the ones I want you to do. I want you to do. I want you to do the anxiety and. Depression scores the gad seven mph united So if you don't if you don't have access to those contact the virtual clinic can get access to. The ones that are most important.
11722.0,Patient,"Okay let's. Is the, this is the first time you're bringing that up to the home how was I supposed to be doing these weekly. uh huh, how can this is the first time you brought it up i've never done those but maybe you don't even know what those are and if. I didn't even what."
416.0,Provider,"you've done. you've done them twice, you did them in May and you did them in June, and then it just stops. So if you can just go back to the virtual clinic sometime soon and make sure that you have access to that and the anxiety and depression."
11722.0,Patient,"survey my gosh you know what I just said it's it's so exciting because I don't know if that might have been necessarily helped me in any way, but when I."
416.0,Provider,help you it's for us to observe your progress or lack thereof over.
11722.0,Patient,"There you go so there's there's there's. In some ways, it could have could have. positively impacted my care, but when I go and search for group. In my emails i've constantly look at an email that says, please make sure you have completed your surveys before your group starts here are the links to your surveys so link this is weekly survey, be a m seven that's the only survey on this thing. Okay i'm looking at is, after months and months of meeting needing to do this, a week I haven't gotten the message back all right, like or any follow me anyone saying that that I haven't been doing these these very important surveys that could have benefited my mental health. You know."
416.0,Provider,they're not directly treating your mental health there for us to monitor you.
11722.0,Patient,"If I hadn't been doing them for the last three months you haven't no one's brought it up i'm trying not to use you personally that they haven't been important enough to bring up in the last. X amount of months, why are they going to be important enough to bring up now. i'm very disappointed with bright heart and in so many ways, sometimes like when I. miss a meeting you know when i'm not arriving at a certain time, how come i'm getting a text message the moment my i'm that it's officially i've missed my meeting, but I can't get a message from you by email or text message saying hey. i'm waiting for you it's five minutes in I mean, are you sitting there for 30 minutes and."
416.0,Provider,Just because it's your responsibility to maintain.
11722.0,Patient,"The appointment we're talking about mental health and we're talking about needing you know. faculty participant in in incense you know. You know, a responsibility, or maybe missing a. reminder or whatnot all right, is it still seems like just a common courtesy, just to message me and be like hey i'm waiting for you, you know."
416.0,Provider,To highlight will not be doing that already.
11722.0,Patient,I know it's obvious you're not Julie it's obvious.
416.0,Provider,"And it's not our policy to do that, and there is a reason for that. We are not in the in the business of managing your calendar for you. You need to manage your calendar, I will help you in slow."
11722.0,Patient,"Motion strategize around stop talking over me please i'm in this meeting. If you're going to talk back to me in a mental health thing and to talk down to me like that, like parent child that's unacceptable and the human being, I don't want i'm the one that's the patient here Julie. that's ironic."
416.0,Provider,kyle.
11722.0,Patient,"All right, it is."
416.0,Provider,And I have a we're not talking. i'm not talking down to you kyle and tried to explain things.
11722.0,Patient,"To people think you know anger management issues, all of these distressing things and that's where you're going to respond, that is not right, this entire program sometimes very disappointing."
416.0,Provider,"You know, but so instead of taking responsibility for managing your calendar you're blaming me. For it."
11722.0,Patient,"Is what i'm hearing asking why. You couldn't extend the text message, when the other counselor has is that a really a big thing to ask thinking that you're sitting there for what 30 minutes going up hasn't come yet i'm just going to wait and oh no."
416.0,Provider,he's not going to pay you for 30 minutes.
11722.0,Patient,"You know what I mean and and and to co from okay weekly weekly weekly to suddenly now it's 30 days to suddenly it's it's you know this in this I just think that it's on a level very wrong. very wrong, and I think you know what i'm asking about i'm not asking you to parent me mess me to establish a common courtesy just a common courtesy which seems kind of totally legitimate thing to ask."
416.0,Provider,kyle there's a pattern here that I need to plan out to you have you blaming me for things that you were supposed to take responsibility for. And that was we I had left you with.
11722.0,Patient,"A job when you, excuse me i've asked why you couldn't in this program you the proverbial you the Royal you could not extend the courtesy text message to me it's a it's a to me it isn't, it is an impression about bright hearth health that I find to be quite."
416.0,Provider,"Well, you don't have."
11722.0,Patient,"You know no I don't have to stay I don't but then again after months and months of missing these surveys Julie, why, could you not notice, you could have seen it three weeks ago and every one of my previous sessions with you. Every single one, you could have taken a moment to look at these very important surveys to then go cry why didn't you do your survey, and this is the time you bring it up after this many months. How am I never said that they were very important. Okay, you know what I meant you could why haven't you been doing your weekly surveys weekly break you take three months, four months, five months to finally bring up that I haven't been doing them. that's what i'm saying so, am I wrong, am I wrong, am I wrong or they not do something, or something you just look at every four or five months. While this conversation with him anymore, and I think i'm going to end."
416.0,Provider,This session because i'm done with this. we're talking about this when it's.
11722.0,Patient,Productive when is it going to be productive for you. You and we can actually have a conversation.
416.0,Provider,Instead of you blaming everything.
11722.0,Patient,um who am I blaming and how.
416.0,Provider,"explain how i'm good right kyle I will talk. About this, one work. On it by an end of the session"
