6762.0,Patient,"Right now, yes um I have a big family, I have a big family even my church to it's a psalm one church. But in my Community or we are we're at a stage it's mostly like my family like a lot of my family live around the area, so we do everything together if we go out we go out together. We talk about it, you know we talk like as a family, because we all came from the one village in some way so it's my family. Members so it's amazing like I said before, it's really nice and my church to. it's mostly every week. We have practice for church for youth performance. And we have, like every week every week and then we have church on Sunday, we spend our whole day I feel like i'm working on that Sunday like so who the Church, so if that helps my anxiety to I always you know the for the. survey for the survey that I feel about there's some questions right there about you know your church Members if, but I feel like extremely they help us a lot. You know, especially myself. It helps me with that point like if i'm feeling down, sometimes, but you know not as much, but I go and talk to my pastor or the wife, so they encouraged me and. Like advice. It really helps like I said it wasn't this time of the year, last year, it was really bad for me, but now. it's better getting better and better every day with the medicine, who i'm telling you i'm not hundred percent but I will say 90% perfect there's sometimes like not very much there sometimes i'm feeling down about worried about something happened. But it's not. Like I want to like go to the emergency or no I managed to to calm myself down. What I need to do, like a breathing and the medicine cuz my doctor before my medicine doctor before she told me if I have that panic attack just drink, one of the bedtime medicine medication to to calm me down make me sleep, so it helps. So yeah my Community really helps a lot for me. And my family."
705.0,Provider,"And having that like a lot of people don't have spirituality to draw on and that's Nice that you do and it like you said. With the medication to it just brings you to a place of comfort, knowing that you can be sad but it's not where the worry and it just keeps coming and just you can't get that thought out of your head and then it affects your mood and then it affects how. You interact with others."
6762.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, like a really helps a lot, it helps or not."
705.0,Provider,"And what you're doing on Sunday to is really providing, especially for you know the younger generation is a foundation. Yes, where they can draw on yeah."
6762.0,Patient,So Nice.
705.0,Provider,"It is and it's nice to that you're giving tools that you know, anyone can, like us, no matter what, no matter what age, they are as it's like Okay, you know, having that belief and having that sense of community and the support."
6762.0,Patient,"This my church Member my Community my family. Really, they really support me especially my kids to I used to be before I usually get mad like really bad and and you know I guess my kids know like. Not to make me angry, but not, I mean my kids they are the kind of like I can always talk to you talk to them like I only came up they already know. You know, or some one way, our culture, we can only talk to you on time if I tell you what to do, then, so you know, sometimes they're not in a good mood of you know, every day, they and then they. When I say something they enjoy me backers and then I will you know tell them so they already know, not to make me angry and frustrated about something that is not like, but because that's me, you know his time like my anger. When like going really high and get mad about something that I know it's not going to be a good decision, or you know, and then, but my kids already know how to control. That to make me angry and all that. But i'm telling you the medication. helps me. perfectly."
705.0,Provider,"I think that the benefit of that is your right before, especially with anger is when you're feeling anxious that feeds into that because you're like literally shaking inside. Yes, yeah."
6762.0,Patient,In my hands is like. glam metal shaking and. really bad.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's just your body in that fight or flight and it's, just like the button stuck, and so the medication removes the button, where you. can continue on yeah. Oh, I am happy that you are able to reflect and see how far you've come, that is just you know, and that the medication is working for you."
6762.0,Patient,"Oh yes. medication and helps me a lot a lot but that's why I never missed my my medication drinking in the morning. Just to control me the whole day, even at work there's some times like i'm feeling, you know how it works, how it works is there's sometimes you frustrated about something, but you know. The medication it's really, really helped me as I drink it in the morning before I go home or your good work and then. When I come home I drink bedtime medication. So make me fall asleep because something when I come home I I don't want to go to sleep."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm but that's helping where you can still get your sleep and have like a proper cycle, which then does it. You know, interfere yeah that's good. yeah. I feel a sense of like things are falling back into place for you."
6762.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. i'm happy for that, too, you know. summary of everything from last year. it's really, really good."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's a lot that everybody has endured and. You know, to have your sense of community your spirituality to draw from. keeps you moving forward."
6762.0,Patient,"And I hope he keeps. Going like that, like. Not. Making me. Stop this stuff like the medication and it really am i'm sure it's really because i'm covered by. The welfare so now i'm working i'm good Kaiser so i'm not sure if. You can cover I mean cover my medication, but i'm still under the welfare medical."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6762.0,Patient,"So i'm sure. you're going to be okay, with the movie kill."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and if you if there's any changes, you need like Kaiser probably has the same medication. yeah. And also, through this process you've already had the experience, where you know you've had to dig yourself out when it got pretty bad for yourself you've been through that, and you know yourself so drawing on that in the future, even if you had even if stuff happens. You know how to handle it. You know how to you know."
6762.0,Patient,yeah I know amanda and control.
705.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely and you also know where to go for help if you need it like you know more resources to if needed. Even earlier when you said that if your pastor if you haven't issued can go to your pasture and if he's not available, that you can even I think he said talk to his wife and it's just like. You already have a B and C plan."
6762.0,Patient,"yep advice and. it's really, really helped me Leo. deserves in my Community a helps a lot like for myself and my family. But before I before I go back to work. I was kind of having that anxiety because you know the income it's it's not. good enough to cover whatever I need and but as well, so like. In my mind like nope I need to go find a job I need to go find a job, right now, so now i'm if I was in a good place like right now, like, I have a job now now my bills are you know all my behind payments are in fact on that track. A. Great update on my my payment so. i'm. i'm really happy for that you know."
705.0,Provider,"And the self esteem, to know that your self resilient that you've bounced back from it, and that you know you're able to manage when you need to if things shift if life shifts gears knowing yourself that you know what you might not like 100% go Oh, this is great it's enjoyable.

6762.0,Patient,"For you, and I."
705.0,Provider,"Right and so, if we look at everything you and I will meet twice a month, and then I had a change to monthly you can come to two more meetings as my understanding, but at least this gives you. A minimum because of work and, if you want to just check in one time, a month and that's Okay, too."
6762.0,Patient,"OK, so the coop session what they should I join any any fighting."
705.0,Provider,"A month yeah once a month any of the Fridays, and what people usually do his parents were where, if you needed a refill like you're ahead of it."
