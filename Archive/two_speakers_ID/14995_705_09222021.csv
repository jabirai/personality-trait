705.0,Provider,"patient is sharing he had tried suicide in 1992 1993 it's been many years ago. So patient and many years has not had any type of suicide ideation no plan no intent patient is currently not suicidal no plan no intent. So on the suicidal risk there's no need for a safety plan because he's not at risk, and so the assessment which show right now, no risk for suicide ideation as far as patient self reporting."
