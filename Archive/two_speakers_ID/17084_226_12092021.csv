I all I did was lay in bed and drink for so long that it's kind of like that was my routine so i'm so used to getting up rolling over and looking for like my alcohol. yeah and so like sometimes i'm just like well, what do I do now so like sometimes it's just familiarity and boredom."
226.0,Provider,Any cravings still.
17084.0,Patient,"And I wouldn't necessarily say craving I have thoughts. About drinking like when i'm at work i'll be like, I want to drink, but I think it's not necessarily craving I think it's mostly just. To embedded in my brain that that's going to be, what I do when I get off of work, so I kind of have to rewrite my brain to think like i'm going to do something else, when I get off work."
226.0,Provider,yeah exactly it's kind of like retraining your thought process around like.
17084.0,Patient,"yeah but as far as cravings go I don't really ever get to the point where and when I needed I needed I needed because. I have my car I have money, so I could go to the store get anytime I want the stores around the corner from my house so at this point it's literally like I don't crave it enough that i'm going to go get it."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, have you ever been in therapy before work with a therapist."
17084.0,Patient,"Around when I was a teenager I did, and I didn't like therapy it just didn't it just wasn't something I liked, and I was totally against anybody told me what to do, back then, so I just said, go. And then, about a year, yet in September of 2020 I tried, through another health care system to get a therapist and a psychologist but I didn't really like the therapist and he was kind of mean. And he just wasn't really he didn't listen very well, he was just kind of more, this is what you have to do, and you have to do this and you have to do that and. yeah so I just didn't have very great experiences."
226.0,Provider,"So when you're a teenager anywhere in therapy, what will you go into therapy for."
17084.0,Patient,"I was bullied a lot, because I was really overweight, by the time I was 18 I was 377 pounds, so I had a lot of just issues from being overweight I didn't have a dad and then I was being bullied so it's just kind of. A lot of stuff."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. All right. So I want to. just go over some treatment plan goals that we can focus on. Okay, so as we work together, like as you're in the program can you think of any short term goals, do you want to work on."
17084.0,Patient,"I want to stay sober. I, in general, want to be more healthier. kind of start exercising a little bit eat healthier. and eat in general, because a lot of times, I just want to eat I drive garden weeks without eating before."
226.0,Provider,Why serious. Are you eating now.
17084.0,Patient,"Oh yeah right now, for the most part, since i'm not drinking pretty much just all I do is eat and work."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so are staying sober. yeah one of the things like a great a great coping skill, is to exercise definitely eating healthier is definitely a coping skill and. attending groups. attending individual counseling like when we meet. So no. Staying sober is about replacing old habits good habits and. Completely staying away from situations or people that create a relapse possible relapse. So yeah you know retraining, we think like okay i'm getting off work that doesn't mean to go get a drink it's like go home and I take a shower I go home and I eat something really healthy or. I go home and I make myself a cup of tea, you know that kind of stuff. So Has anybody ever talked to you about coping skills and and what those are."
17084.0,Patient,"yeah i've been rehab twice, I know about coping skills just it's really hard for me to figure out what minor."
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So one of them, you know, crafts, you like crops. Do you like, to work out."
17084.0,Patient,um no but. Once I start doing something if I have a goal I don't stop doing it. I don't take no for an answer ever.
226.0,Provider,"So let's do like maybe a short term goal would be to exercise like what do you think is reasonable, like two or three times a week. And would that be like walking like what would that exercise look like."
17084.0,Patient,i'm probably walking because Dr pachter has told me he wants me to get out and start taking marks he thinks that will help my mood a little bit.
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely because you want to be out in the fresh air. and your son has you know that's where you get natural vitamin D. Okay, so we'll do so for short term goal for staying sober exercising at least two to three times a week by walking getting outside and then also. attending group one time per per week. And then. attending individual counseling two times per month. Okay cool all right, what about long term."
17084.0,Patient,"Long term goal um right now my only long term goal is to figure out what I want to do and get an actual career. Okay, because I just turned 26 and kind of tired of fast food and. minimum wage."
226.0,Provider,"yeah okay that's a good one, like like maybe research, think about what you'd like to do."
17084.0,Patient,yeah okay.
226.0,Provider,that's good anything else any other long term goals you could think of.
17084.0,Patient,A different one I have is eventually I want to save enough money next year to buy a new car because i've never been able to buy a brand new car and mine right now is just horrible.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, good one. Alright cool and any questions."
17084.0,Patient,Really.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know go to group one time one time, a week on Fridays right. So, Dr proctor and I lead that group. And then you'll meet with me twice a month, just to do individual therapy. Okay, so like when we meet it's just a good time to talk about things that might have come up for you anything that you might be struggling with something that might be bothering you anything that you want to focus on that would really enhance your sobriety. Okay, so are there, certain days and times that work better, for you."
17084.0,Patient,um my work schedule is kind of ever changing right now. I have. Every Monday off so far this month. And Fridays off so far.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, why don't we plan on Monday December 27. Okay, what morning or afternoon."
