214.0,Provider,Oh. So look at this I love when I see this okay. So. Everything here is marvelous looks wonderful world compliant all the surveys are done but big better than that. Is what this chart is telling us. So this child is saying to us hey. she's making progress let's make let's let her do less.
14334.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"So I don't know if you see it making progress. so that you know the surveys your attend your your your attendance, the discussions that we have that the system filters all that information and makes recommendations, so you seeing."
14334.0,Patient,Maybe you.
214.0,Provider,"feel it but you're seeing results of what we do. Oh, what do you think about the wellbutrin."
14334.0,Patient,"i've only had it today, it was the first day I got it. Okay, because it came the prescription was filled the day before I left, so I grabbed it and then I kind of way to do it to that i'll still have some when I get back. Right I didn't feel any I don't feel any different today so."
214.0,Provider,we'll see why you're.
14334.0,Patient,"Well, I know the pharmacist said that it could take a couple of weeks, but I mean with the adderall I felt a difference that I did not like it, the same day, I took it."
214.0,Provider,Right so Seattle is. A stimulant. yeah it's an immediate bang to the system. This is more of a bind to receptors so. This could take anywhere between seven to 21 days. yeah good okay.
14334.0,Patient,So.
214.0,Provider,"All right, so this is your interpretations, for your pH Q nine he mostly this and it's six six reflects mild depression, what do you think."
14334.0,Patient,"Oh, I think that's where i'm usually Am I mean, I just have a lot in my life and i'm not. there's still other stuff where i'm not being fulfilled, but this i'm not getting anywhere with other things too so. that's I know that's what i'm dealing with. My. Within my my realm of capability."
214.0,Provider,But but but we're going to see how well you've done or you've done very well and you're not seeing that. So we'll see that in the minimum we trend. So anxieties forwards his model I. think that that's an accurate statement.
14334.0,Patient,"Overall inside, yes, I know I have days, where situations, make it worse, I mean flying the other day, getting ready and out the door until I was checked through security things it was through the roof, but it's it oh yeah. I didn't have a travel letter for my son's dad to make sure, but sometime i've never needed it but i've always traveled one oh like this is the one time they're going to ask for it, and all that stuff but in that meeting it and then making. sure that my coven tests were in in time and all that stuff just adds to the things that I need. To do when it's outside of my control, but I still worry about it."
214.0,Provider,"Right right, so this one's an interesting one. So if i'm not mistaken, this one is. This one. So, this one is early October you're at an eight."
14334.0,Patient,uh huh.
214.0,Provider,"you're on a five a five. October we now in the summer. Depression is lower. It may not feel that way too, but the testing tells us. Some things become more manageable. it's not really. into you do two points over. So that would be to be six weeks in no time with depression will be almost zero every year doing. It seems like your anxiety is always between four and five, which is very low."
14334.0,Patient,mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,You are making improvements I just don't know if you feel that that's true.
14334.0,Patient,"I still don't I still feel like i'm in the same place, that I have been for the last six months or so. Because nothing I guess has really changed in that time. I don't know."
214.0,Provider,"interesting how you see that. But, to a certain extent, everything has changed. Your situation with your husband remains. murky I say, not because of him up because of the quiet and all this other stuff but you've become a self sustaining sufficient superpower."
14334.0,Patient,or.
214.0,Provider,"Six months that makes you double superpower, so I, I see this big change in a very positive way it's falling not. Reflecting it our way in turn a little. Something here. question. So when are you going back home again."
14334.0,Patient,The 29th I leave here.
214.0,Provider,Drug screens before.
14334.0,Patient,i've never done one except for my initial intake.
214.0,Provider,"yeah you wouldn't okay so to me and. So when we look at this now. it's. Right. So. Do access to CC shuttle twice a month, which is a group so shanteau twice twice me once. So that's good how how is your son making out."
14334.0,Patient,"He has some behavioral issues, right now, which is stressful good not sure whether. I kind of know what's coming from, but I don't know why he's reacting that way, the way he was cheating and he's starting to show that he has a temper whereas he's never done that, before."
214.0,Provider,Can you build though or or it's just.
14334.0,Patient,"It just happens it kind of just happens like I was last night, I know I know he was tired I knew that but there's sometimes. he's been having an issue or he's been calling he's willing to miss some of his neighbors where he calls them stupid. Like we don't call people names, or whatever, so I removed him from the situation i'm like I gave him a warranty and I removed him. And then I put him in his room for some quiet time because he was Oh, I need to calm down a little bit, but then he starts throwing things at the door, and all this stuff and I want to break the door down i'm like you're for why are you behaving this way. So i'm. Just like I wanted your attention i'm like well being quiet and to get mommy's attention to come in quicker than you throwing stuff at the door right but I had to go in to make sure he wasn't hurting himself or hurting the apartments."
214.0,Provider,Well it's just. there's a lot going on for the little guy to do.
14334.0,Patient,"It is and that's you know, so I started to make sure we get good connection time several times a day throughout the day, especially since we've had a lot of us time between us being sick. or him having to isolate because he had exposure at school and then towards the last week and a half i've just kept him away from everybody, so that he wouldn't get sick before trip. kind of thing and so it's been a lot of just him and I so maybe that's also some of the behavioral issues."
214.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14334.0,Patient,"Right now, so right now he's loving playing with his cousin SIS and is now non Papa he's like mom I don't need you. i'm okay with that nobody."

So I will definitely come to group because you've already made your to but chanterelles gotta be the prescribers that she needs to know what's going on, so just because we're reducing it, because you're doing so well, she still has to keep up with the medication when she doesn't see."
14334.0,Patient,It yeah.
214.0,Provider,"that's the trickier so you attending and saying hey, by the way, and i'll tell it to hey I only have to come twice so she should be giving you. A refill to the next, right to the next jump there should be a 14 day 15 day."

214.0,Provider,"You know the requirements for two groups, this would be coming to just tell the provider hey we just all need to be synced up now because i'm only common every other or just too, so you got to keep those prescriptions Bible. Some people come the first month in the last month, some people don't come every other week or they'll come the first and the second and the third, and the fourth provider the prescriber has to be aware. Like oh that's right she doesn't have to attend. So let me write a longer school so she may. Just try to a month script it may be easier for you to."
