298.0,Provider,"Sir, anything that i've not asked you. That would be really good to know."
17821.0,Patient,"um I have a family history of OCD depression, anxiety panic attacks and tourette's. That runs and."
298.0,Provider,"So when it comes to how to treat those things, let me tell you, it has to be treated in layers and klonopin can definitely be one of the layers that you treat one you look at doing. Something like serotonin what serotonin does on the brain, is it puts a thin little film over the serotonin neuron so you're not completely exposed so that would be one thing, the next thing you would look at would be doing anti anxiety medication strictly anti anxiety like boost par. And then you would have a breakthrough klonopin for your for what doesn't what those things don't catch and you have a panic attack that's what the klonopin would be for. Are you willing to go under my recommendations for that."
17821.0,Patient,Whatever you think I just know what has helped me in the past.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so as those other medications are starting to get will will do klonopin more now. As those medications are getting built up in your bloodstream and then we will pull back. people get so attached to their benzodiazepines that they have freak out me thinking of me taking it away from them, they have their freakout moments, but there's danger in having long term klonopin use or any benzodiazepine yes, and that it kind of messes with the brain as far as. It can cause dementia long term it just has a lot of icky side effects to it. So I will um let's talk about mood swings do you have mood swings."
17821.0,Patient,yeah I do.
298.0,Provider,Do you think it's extreme.
17821.0,Patient,"No. When i'm in high anxiety, I feel, and more irritable and more edgy."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
17821.0,Patient,versus when i'm calm. i'm i'm fine. it's it's. it's at its peak I guess you can say when i'm irritable and i'm full of anxiety that's that's when it. So yeah i'm really.
298.0,Provider,"So my recommendation is let's start out a small dose of serotonin like XO loft and, as you don't have side effects, then we can increase it, and that would be one place to start. And then i'll write you a prescription for klonopin for you, for now. And till we get your mentor out of therapeutic dose so so loft Have you ever heard of boost part."
17821.0,Patient,Of yeah kind of I mean i'm not too sure what it is.
298.0,Provider,"Okay it's strictly anti anxiety, the top dose is 16 milligrams, but we have to climb our way there and. The other thing about boost part is it's awesome in the long term, they say that people report long term results as good as a benzodiazepine but it takes even two weeks for it to start working and then you've got to climb to get it to work so bear with me on that one and. How our program works is I see you in group once a week. And for an hour and then. You go to individual therapy i'm not there, an individual therapy i'm their group but i'm not an individual therapy. And so you have a, Chancellor, that you see that way. And you make NUTS done about every other. that's done about every other week the individual counseling it can be a lot to be in a mental health program but the benefits are amazing when you figure it all out it's the figuring it out the learning curve can be a little steep and i'm sorry about that."
17821.0,Patient,So I. Will I be taking the zoloft with my paxil as well.
298.0,Provider,Are you on paxil right now.
17821.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm on 60 milligrams of paxil."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, no Absolutely not. Okay, what I did not hear that you were currently taking I thought you. I thought you were on nothing."
17821.0,Patient,"No, no, no i'm on i'm on paxil I was taking 40 milligrams for the longest time and just about maybe. Six months ago. Before I got insurance, I was paying cash and and the doctor at the time. up the dose to 60."
298.0,Provider,"Okay well that's good enough for the serotonin. i'm canceling the order for the zoloft. Okay, and. So boost par i'm going to start at 10 milligrams twice a day if you feel like you get the flu like it, he brings on the flu it's possible that the serotonin is too strong and we won't be able to do that, because there is some serotonin in. boost par but stay in contact with me to let me know if it's you know how you're doing on that. How long have you been on the paxil."
17821.0,Patient,Since I was 13 I was klonopin and pack so those those two are what has worked for me.
298.0,Provider,"Right now i'm going to prescribe the klonopin next. um i'm not saying that i'll give you what you had in the past, but what was it I couldn't find a pharmacy. Road and you. Go ahead."
17821.0,Patient,one milligram.
298.0,Provider,And that's once a day.
17821.0,Patient,Once a day correct.
298.0,Provider,"hi i'm sending that over to the rite aid that you recommend in. When is a good time for you to come to group, like what works for your schedule."
17821.0,Patient,And what day would it be.
298.0,Provider,Monday through Friday I have groups.
17821.0,Patient,Probably I would say Tuesday or Wednesday.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, Tuesday, at 1pm or."
17821.0,Patient,2pm 1pm is perfect okay.
298.0,Provider,Okay there'll be somebody calling you on the phone to get you scheduled for your next appointment so okay.
17821.0,Patient,Okay Thank you so much.
298.0,Provider,"All right, and you can go to the pharmacy now and pick up your minutes."
17821.0,Patient,"Okay Thank you so much what when do we I guess rizal your way or is that, during the course of."
298.0,Provider,"Of that, at the end of group you let me know you can chat me, you can meet with me, and let me know where you're at if you want to individually, make an appointment with me, you can do that also. Okay okay. You you're welcome. bye bye."
17821.0,Patient,bye bye.
298.0,Provider,So she has the low suicide level risk I did a panic disorder she probably needs to rents added to that miss of the eye movement.
