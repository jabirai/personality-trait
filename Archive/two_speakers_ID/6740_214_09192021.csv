6740.0,Patient,could be better.
214.0,Provider,what's what's what's what's weighing heavy for you.
6740.0,Patient,"Well, it seems like it was kind of. All of a sudden. Like i've been going and get nikkei geez done, you know multiple in a year, and this is the first time they've even mentioned the blockage and they said that there's two arteries on the left side of my heart that one of them is 68% blocked and the other is 65. And then there's other blockages in my arteries around my junk. Like in between my legs, which I thought there was some weird bumps going on around there but it's like. I don't know how I haven't had. Knowledge from all the other Ek geez like I would think i've been doing this for years, I would think it would be like oh in the beginning, you know you're 35% blocked your 50 you know you would think there would be some gradual build up. But it's like all this time and they've never told me."
214.0,Provider,"Or is it possible that no one quarter like I don't I don't know if I can. preach the facts now, but what would it change that 30% What would you what would What would it make a difference between 40 and 60."
6740.0,Patient,I might have quit smoking sooner.
214.0,Provider,"Okay. We started eating healthy. Sooner okay. Okay, so let's just stop the tape for a minute and now let's go to today we know where we're at is that going to get you to stop smoking and eating healthier."
6740.0,Patient,"that's what i'm trying. But, like my wife basically told me that's a waste of time and I shouldn't even try to cut back on smoking right now. it's."
214.0,Provider,"me, I have to tell you I know for a fact that if you don't stop smoking it's going to create more problems or whatever they're going to block they won't be able to. Better cleaning off it because of the smoking, the tar and the toxicity from it really clogs the arteries the way i'm seeing it yes and it's not me it's OK, so now, this is determination, a couple of life life things that are going to change, but I look at this. I think this is a benefit. Right those things that nothing not too much. But i'm wondering if the energy clarity in the mind. lesson anxiety, this will really start to get into. Your second coming was the sobriety. Is that something that you've achieved well most haven't but think about this other calling now you've got sobriety and a clean bunch of avenues in your body what Joseph be them. Right, I think, I think, yes, I would agree that this is not happy news I would agree that maybe I would have thought, something, but I think we need to work on what are the, what are the remedies not which i'm assuming by they're going to go to unclog the arteries."
6740.0,Patient,"yeah he said that I had to have a lab work done, and neither ekg and I did that, before I left the hospital so i'm assuming he's going to call me when the labs are through."
214.0,Provider,So you'll get that call this week.
6740.0,Patient,that's what i'm expecting.
214.0,Provider,So do you know what the procedure is like.
6740.0,Patient,"not really he didn't like him. he's been all cool every time I talked to him and. Like even talking about the blockages he was all nonchalant about it, like. I said."
214.0,Provider,"But he also doesn't want to create more because you're the one that has to sit with it, so if he engages in. Oh, my goodness, you know, this is a really good, and if we don't hurry up like he doesn't want to engage in that, because that does nothing good for you so his. His nonchalant know, maybe like damn you like you're not finding this a priority is the way he's trying to address your calm. that's actually a good doctor he's de escalating before it escalates because it's going to escalate when you figure out you got to go on for me to procedure. Which i'm assuming is the catheter they've got to go into the vein in the lake and they've got to go all the way up with the balloon and clean out. Right it, I mean it's it's it's been a practice I don't know for 20 years like this isn't like open heart surgery, this is something that's very normal procedure least dangerous least invasive most frequent time, so I think that, although you know it's unsettling. it's still information you have to address it, you have a brand from anything since i've known you."
6740.0,Patient,it's just it's pretty discouraging. hard not to get worked up over it. And like yesterday.
214.0,Provider,"What would you do with the workup don't like just walk me through it not, that you don't need to be validated, not that you shouldn't be totally friggin person, what would you do with it."
6740.0,Patient,i'm not really sure.
214.0,Provider,"Right, like you, can't go to the doctor's office okay that's worth 250,000 and you did the same test, and I want to like you can even quantify forget about money. This is really like I guess where you're at is like I would have done this show right yeah I would have been would have been ahead of the eight ball, I would have been way ahead of the game, but the reality is you still are going to be ahead of the game, so you started saying yesterday."
6740.0,Patient,"yeah yesterday I I got really sick and It reminded me of cotton fever, but. I think it was something I ate i'm hoping, because I was throwing up, I was sweating but I was freezing and shaking trembling and I couldn't be upright without throwing up so laying down, I had to spend, to the point, I had to put a hand and foot on the floor and. It started at like two o'clock in the afternoon and it didn't end until seven this morning. But."
214.0,Provider,sounds like it's a lot of information.
6740.0,Patient,"yeah I was kind of hoping, I had coven. Oh, but. my brother had. Right now, so. Now he's out of jail now. Okay, but I saw him, less than a week ago and. Right after I saw him, he said that he was in quarantine because his wife, has it. So. He had a positive test like two days ago. So in the moment I was thinking to myself, I really hope that it's coven and it's not like my heart shut down."
214.0,Provider,"I get it, I that's that's fair but I mean we also have to acknowledge you just put your pants on one one parent one leg, at a time you don't have a big s on your chest, this is a lot of information you got two kids that you love unconditionally. Right, I know that you love your wife and I know at times their land mines, but like. Your whole life was being different than when you work at this This is like your legacy legacy to be so much different. And to prevent and have your children aware and tested to make sure that, if anything, we can get early detection, this is really what your whole life is and kind of did not the kind of that up with a nice shot. So I think you know. What happens. What happens."
6740.0,Patient,Right. Right.
214.0,Provider,"there's always a way to look at it i'm just trying to be like you know what better late than never. leave us to play and I think what has happened is you know I don't even know how you got this Doc I forget how you went to that whole. Reason get him, but he was the one that didn't think a couple of things and now he's found something that he believes is that 60 something percent but what happens if the other doctors that have been yet another guy because. Like I really think that I don't know you need to look up and say to somebody thanks thanks a million man."
6740.0,Patient,"conversation I had with him. Was i'm not gonna change anything. Your previous doctor probably knew what he was doing so we're going to leave it at that, but then it's it was probably a month and a half or two months ago I started having chest pain at night so. I went down to the local doctor and had an ekg done and she's like wow you know that's a really weird ekg they did it again she's like your left is blocked like you have to go to your heart doctor now. And they couldn't fit me in for probably about a month and a half now. And then, now I finally got in but i'm glad I did and. Now we can go from here."
214.0,Provider,"I think, as much as we're upset well, maybe we towards the real pissed off mode, you can do something with this information, this information isn't fine on you don't have a saying that your say in it for your kids your wife yourself. it's you know what I saw I saw one time to fix this I have more time than correction, but you need to chill out with the smoke and actually he's probably going to actually stop smoking before that procedure."
6740.0,Patient,"yeah he asked me to. When I left. And i'm down to I want to say 10 in the day, instead of 40."
214.0,Provider,that's that's. that's like doing none.
6740.0,Patient,"Now, and. I feel like chain smoking, right now, though."
214.0,Provider,"i'm sure you did well listen. At the end of the day, is it the worst thing that you change, though, because you can worse things right. right idea here is. you've been a thinker, especially with the projects for them all die with the with the same with this, so what am I going to get a change open, other than impeding maybe three more. Like. Right, maybe, maybe stay 10 and understanding that timeframe and, as you get closer to try to get either none, I mean. I don't think I could ask anyone to stop doing anything before any procedure with or with any news like who copes with that, like this ain't about let's meditate let's get on the floor and do yoga need that time that's not gonna work."
6740.0,Patient,she gave me permission to drink a six pack. I didn't but.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I was there. I think you need to stay with the strength that you got john i'm just not only as your friend Budget Office listen, you can dream, and you can do a dime bag, what can we get to the surgery first."
6740.0,Patient,that's i'm open.
214.0,Provider,"And I know you're going to get through it, I know you're going to get through it, I know the information isn't. Again i'm going to go with you know what something occurred because something had to change, whether we believe in a higher power, whether we. believe in a God or not. someone's like oh shipment Joe we're gonna have to help Joe we're gonna have to make some changes here we're gonna have to get them to go to the er and before you know it day you are. Right, so if, although not the blessing, you will look, for it is really ultimately the blessing for you, your children and your wife."
6740.0,Patient,And i'm hoping they'll have something to say this week.
214.0,Provider,"Oh i'm sure he will have 60% um I don't I don't think he's like i'll put that guy like put him on the 90 day calendar, we got that that's a cow he's got he's got he's got to get you out and the other thing too is i'm just. Like a major i'm wondering how much you really."
6740.0,Patient,couldn't get worse.
214.0,Provider,"No, no, we all know that you're ready with this information."
6740.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,I know. You just gotta just got to keep doing what you're doing reaching out to somebody you can always reach out to me if you want to reach out to me because you email me i'll. Get you on the countdown.
6740.0,Patient,still got john the 30th.
214.0,Provider,"But I mean between now and the third, you can go down."
6740.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,I I personally se you have an update before Friday of this week.
6740.0,Patient,i'm hoping.
214.0,Provider,i'm.
6740.0,Patient,Trying to be optimistic.
214.0,Provider,Stay optimistic not. telling you this. Back to he wants to see you again it's got to figure out to make adjustments in your diet which. I mean you're on psychotropic medications as well as opiates.
6740.0,Patient,I found out that i'm pre diabetic as well. On the same day.
214.0,Provider,They actually did. Well pre diabetic your. diet isn't the greatest you can change that you don't want to be taking insulin and psychotropic and. suboxone you can change that you had to cut the sugar that must be you still must have a high intake of sugar.
6740.0,Patient,yeah i'm trying to have more like read me. peppers and rice and like tonight was chicken and rice and peppers. But there was a lot of like snacks at bedtime because of that seroquel.
214.0,Provider,"I don't know I totally get it, I would try I don't know you all went nuts. You know, like a whole nother."
6740.0,Patient,"Well, I had that diverticulitis happened, so I stopped eating and after that."
214.0,Provider,"The one that should be fine, it should be like sunflower seeds cashews researchers."
6740.0,Patient,kicked my ass.
214.0,Provider,"I can't process those. at all. But the one that but, again, if it's going to buy. The summer listen I. Know you're going to have to chill out with those trees."
6740.0,Patient,All right.
214.0,Provider,"we'll have we'll have a tree in the afternoon, so you can burn it all store in a day, instead of. sitting in your body you become you know pre diabetic."
6740.0,Patient,it's hard not to eat him at bedtime.
214.0,Provider,"I know because that's the structure. Just think about it it's it's a process isn't we're not turning you into a monk, and one day like that's just not we all got to be realistic. Right. You did it with the cigarettes i'm sure you could do it with the sweets, but the last thing we want you to do is become diabetic with everything else it's a lot. it'll be a lot of."
6740.0,Patient,juggling the kids. Is. Fine.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I know I know, but I do think you'll be a burst. burst of energy, after this because you're only a 40% capacity basically."
6740.0,Patient,yeah it's. Like trying to do anything heavy lifting is impossible right now.
214.0,Provider,"mean that that will definitely change it stronger, but the idea here is. Any change you make as a fan of smoking, no all that i'm telling you is is a big benefit because they're going to want you to stop smoking before that I know he's going to tell you that. Now, if you can control it. Another three and then another three and another three you'll be down to one which is basically from one to 40 you've done an extraordinary job but that's how I would I would start to gauge it, I would say, between two to three weeks you're going to be in there for that surgery."
6740.0,Patient,yeah and there's a lot of downtime. or recovery.
214.0,Provider,yeah because it goes into the.
6740.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"It does is it seems like you're pretty much a bounce back type of fellow I don't see you being like ringing the bell and get me some tea and the thing, let me see Do I really don't I don't see you."
6740.0,Patient,"can't be allowed to do that that's the other part of it you're not going to be allowed to have a belt, but I just don't see you."
214.0,Provider,"being totally incapacitated won't be able to function, I think you're just geared to function so maybe the first two days will be. A little like getting over the pain, but by the third day i'm sure you'll be up around I really do because most people up in the third day somewhere up in the second date depends, you know tolerance of pain."
6740.0,Patient,Now I don't know how. All the different meds will work with something like that going on.
214.0,Provider,"Well, he knows you're on the opiate that's going to be the one they need to worry about because they're gonna have to give you some native. Man, you know and then what he may do is bounce it back to shauntel. To give you additional medications for the pain, instead of adding another pain pill. Right right they may go up, for they may go up six they may go a bit just to address pain and the other part, to be for the surprise."
6740.0,Patient,and make sense.
214.0,Provider,"that's usually how they they really try not to add like. Any Leo perks and they really try not to they'll have to do the sedation they can't get around that because you can't be up, but this other stuff they may give you some pain medicine, the beginning but they're going to want you totally going back to your prescriber so. um once your next appointment what I say it, you know."
6740.0,Patient,I don't have one with him right now.
214.0,Provider,"So he's out this week, I will definitely see if you can get him on already because you guys probably should be talking about what that looks like so you got information from this end. to figure out this doctors trying to give you, you know, an abundance of mana payments to see what I say good things about payments they. are very cautious with people on payments."
6740.0,Patient,i'm already on no heart medication. Only took it yesterday and today. But I need to let them know i'm on a new medication anyway.
214.0,Provider,"yeah, so I would I would think that. This would be a good time to call up and say hey, by the way, you know, this is what we're looking at and, in fact, by the time you get to have your meeting with him, you may know, actually when the surgery is. Right, the procedures so just procedure. and take it from now."
6740.0,Patient,I think that's the plan.
214.0,Provider,"Right that's the plan, and if you need me in the interim just do yesterday just have to be wise birthday, so I wasn't paying attention to the emails."
6740.0,Patient,yeah wasn't expecting you until Monday anyway.
214.0,Provider,"All right, well, no I I usually start picking them up again on Sunday, but if you need me during the week, for whatever reason doesn't have to be this information you just need to kick around and talk to somebody just give me an email i'll figure it out the day and i'll put you in."
6740.0,Patient,"All right, I appreciate it."
214.0,Provider,hey take care and i'll have a good one.
6740.0,Patient,Thank you you're.
214.0,Provider,Welcome bye.
