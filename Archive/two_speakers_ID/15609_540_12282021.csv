15609.0,Patient,yeah same old same old run out of money and broken vehicle. Okay.
540.0,Provider,So just stress galore.
15609.0,Patient,"yeah sorta. Just tired of being broke and. i'm sure, something I could do about and I can't even think of anything illegal to do. Legal that is."
540.0,Provider,Is there any way to get any type like increases or additional like finances to come your way.
15609.0,Patient,"I try, I tried that a couple of years ago, I was sure you're supposed to be able to make at least this amount of money, a year, or a month or whatever you know. They wouldn't even let me do it, I don't know what happened yeah it was. I guess they didn't feel like I could do it, or something. That really got much of a choice at this point. So."
540.0,Provider,"Right now, where you guys are living it's not like like social security living space it's like a apartment."
15609.0,Patient,me well it's like a trailer really yeah. yeah.
540.0,Provider,For the trailer.
15609.0,Patient,"Every month, I basically run out of money, about a couple weeks, you know before I get paid so it's more than I can make the you know. it's and I don't know it wasn't so bad at first, but It just seems like everything is getting more and more costly. And then, when something breaks down, you know. I have to pay to fix it my dogs kicking she's got an eight year. But and I got well my truck needs a heater core I tried to fix it they worked for a while my truck was being held together with gorilla glue. gorilla glue and it worked for a while, but it, you know broke loose and I did it again, but. It ain't gonna last you."
540.0,Provider,know.
15609.0,Patient,And then the car and your car breaks. Everything starting to. rain down. and
540.0,Provider,thought about just having one car to try to decrease that financial burden.
15609.0,Patient,"yeah but that's not a good idea. know that yeah well. You have to have, for all your i've basically to leave here during the winter, because if not you're I mean 664 it's a goes up and down, and you know it's a terrible war. And I live down like this and, in so yeah you'd never get out. Sometimes it's even hard with formal drugs. But you got kind of got to have that and having that it costs more to drive because of the you know the gas. So that's why the car comes in handy. When it's not snowing so cheaper. But. I was trying to. recruit this drummer so we can start playing on the weekend, so at least i'd make money that way that's a pretty good way to make money really plus it's fun, you know."
540.0,Provider,"I mean, do you have to wait for the drummer or can you."
15609.0,Patient,"well. that's what I don't understand like why won't our drummer do it, it doesn't make any sense I don't know what the hell was going on but. I don't know. All I know is the other guitar player said, if we find a drummer let's go play covers and make money."
540.0,Provider,Just kind of wearing what are you looking right now on it.
15609.0,Patient,"We got the guy a drummer he. came over before was playing with us for a little bit and he came back and we asked him if he wanted to. You know. play some songs on a weekend that makes them money he didn't really say anything about it, he just kind of I don't know he's strange for one like he. He talks a fast and it doesn't make much sense and he goes like off somewhere it's really weird but um I don't know I don't know what is the answer was basically so I was waiting for the Sunday but. This Sunday the guitar players wife is sick and. She don't want to get anybody sick, so you know. A rain me out of there real quick. yeah. and that's all I knew to do is play music cuz."
540.0,Provider,Go and does your girlfriend is she on disability yeah or.
15609.0,Patient,hasn't even started or nothing so. I don't know what's going on there. that's not helping either I don't know. But.
540.0,Provider,So what's not started on it has she not started the paperwork or.
15609.0,Patient,"Not nothing no nothing. But I got this little we built these little buildings out here for storage, you know and like store no tools on the mower and all that stuff and I turned one of them until like a little room, so I couldn't like play music and and stuff and. And there's like two little buildings together, so the one, there were like literally right next to each other, so I can actually you know cut a doorway out and turn them into one. which I haven't yet I haven't done that yet, but i'm still kind of in the process of setting the other one but it's pretty cool. Like a little hidey place you know. go out there and play music the dog won't cry if I play guitar. Or we frozen. Oh, there you go."
540.0,Provider,There you go i'm using. That you cut out when you said that you could make it into one room.
15609.0,Patient,"um yeah I haven't got that far yet, but. I almost did but it's kind of set up new I can get their. record and stuff like that plus I won't make such a mess in the House, trying to make it that other guitar it's made a mess, I was like. At least I get a break from this."
540.0,Provider,Size nice to get out of the House. To even if it's just going into a little different building. yeah yeah.
15609.0,Patient,"I was gonna put a little tiny window and. yeah make some curtains just joke. actually going to be kind of kind of neat you know you could see all the one day what. Would we like tiny House you know. I was going to look and see what all kind of because there's a whole bunch of different ways, you can save space. You know those people that do that tiny house living they get all these creative things that you can just like fold it against the wall here, I want to do that because I like making stuff you know. let's go and try and make like a little spot I can make guitar bodies or whatnot Sir."
540.0,Provider,"Well, that can be another like financial thing that you can be doing to."
15609.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I wanted to do. right before I got divorced, that was the plan, I was gonna get all the tools that I needed, and you know start making custom bodies like guitars and stuff but."
540.0,Provider,"Well, now there's I mean now there's a lot of sites that like help you out like with the business aspect of it like etsy like you can sell all your stuff on etsy do you know it is. yeah anyone that does like their own crafting or their own template work they sell it on like that site and like they help like with like the kind of like the financial part of it."
15609.0,Patient,So you don't.
540.0,Provider,have to worry about that.
15609.0,Patient,"Oh, I get and then they take their percentage and."
540.0,Provider,I think that I think they take it from like the taxing portion of it. yeah.
15609.0,Patient,"that's pretty cool there. I ever get. You can get that. that's not yes, not even anywhere near. yeah yeah. shoot I couldn't last one I was working on I. was trying to put in this there's like these two though they were like I don't know what you call them they're the silver like NUTS looking things and they go into the guitar body and they hold the bridge down there at the bottom, where the strings go in. Okay, so I went to tap on in, and I am and the whole thing she heard, I was like."
540.0,Provider,that's the one that you're just working on.
15609.0,Patient,"ended up breaking so I took. The real a glue, of course, which holds my life together basically. I took that and a bunch of solid dust and like stirred it up made moon would out of it put a bit your worked."
540.0,Provider,So some fans so it's back together.
15609.0,Patient,"And I rewired it again because it ended up ripping some mount you know but that's all ready to go just. isn't finished yet yeah. But now I have if I get this thing done, I have a space to do it now yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Do you have like a little like heater setup out there, or."
15609.0,Patient,"yeah i've got tons a little space heaters where. I bought a converter from my truck when the heater you know broken a thought i'd fix it, so I got all these electric heaters everywhere, I can use one of this. sucks too, because I want to have a third don't have a thermostat so you got to like turn it on and off."
540.0,Provider,When it's the right time.
15609.0,Patient,"yeah but you know. How you light a cigarette and that's enough heat in there it's that small. yeah it's a lot bigger than right here, but. yeah it's pretty cool I don't know why I didn't think of that we should have been here for a year, and you know we've talked about it before but."
540.0,Provider,yeah what made you actually go out and start using it.
15609.0,Patient,"i'd say the Miss I was leaving the House, yes, I was painting outside, but when you bring it in its he's still smell that man that painting. Is rough so I can be I didn't want to do that anymore. Plus waking up with you know splinters and wouldn't everywhere on you from you. know not not cool."
540.0,Provider,And how's you and your girlfriend.
15609.0,Patient,"All right, yeah yeah."
540.0,Provider,"how's it, how do you guys manage the stress together."
15609.0,Patient,"i'm not sure. I guess we just kind of do. But I don't know everything that's just seems like all sudden everything costs a lot more. Since all the prices are going up so it's kind of just started to happen so yeah. Like a few months ago, like you know, there was an extra couple green bank in its OK. And now it's like I have 94 cents so wait a minute yeah."
540.0,Provider,And when's the next time you get paid.
15609.0,Patient,"yeah third. The third, which I figured I get paid early from all holidays, but of course the third doesn't fall on a weekend, so I still had away. So that sucked plus we're sorry Burke, we can invite any presence or anything. All we did was we didn't do anything shoot. That sucks too damn couldn't even get none for anybody. That was kind of crappy."
540.0,Provider,"But it's also it's not always about presence, especially when you're at an age where you know, like that financial it's just it's sometimes that portion of holidays it's just not worth that just killing yourself over something that some presence that may linger in a closet or."
15609.0,Patient,Right and.
540.0,Provider,it's a lot more than just the presence.
15609.0,Patient,"So sexy can't even you know I didn't even have an option so like damn yeah or at least bought some shit you know, for some, you know something. Or can I get food yeah here's a can of soup right Christmas unit right."
540.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully, I maybe this can encourage your girlfriend to really get on the paperwork for the social security because i'm sure that that it's better than nothing."
15609.0,Patient,yeah sort of.
540.0,Provider,what's stopping her from getting started on.
15609.0,Patient,"i've no idea. I guess just. not paying enough attention, I guess."
540.0,Provider,or something that you could sit down with her and be like hey like why don't we do this. weekend or something and start the paperwork.
15609.0,Patient,yeah gonna have to. Because if nah man like we're around and now yours is I don't make enough money for even just for myself in it. So now there's me and Aaron and poor beggar you know accountant damn change to try to get her something he sucks I don't want to look like this man this sucks.
540.0,Provider,"And, have you. talked to your girlfriend about this. yeah what does she said."
15609.0,Patient,"That sucks you know. But. I gotta get something something. To give yeah. or get something going on, or something."
540.0,Provider,sooner that you get on the process of starting her paperwork it's also they'll they'll back pay certain things too so it's. it's getting getting going with the paperwork and a lot of its online nowadays.
15609.0,Patient,Oh yeah Mitch Mitch you look at.
540.0,Provider,"mean a lot they don't even allow a lot of paper applications anymore, they don't want mail."
15609.0,Patient,"yeah true. yeah there's a lot of wasted. Just a waste, you know all that papers like. Paper yeah I mean he wants to he wants all that crap I say every time I check the mail like look at all these trees are just wasting. for nothing. For an advertisement you. know. But once. I hopefully once the ball gets a role. But in the meantime, just like panic, no matter what, and I can't even really do anything about anything. Where do you start."
540.0,Provider,I mean cuz you can't work at all so that's.
15609.0,Patient,"yeah and even even the trying like that little part time thing. That you know i'm waiting I worked for like a couple of days a week or something at this one place for like a trial, but then they just never called me back I don't know, maybe I don't Yes, they didn't like me or I wouldn't work on out. Nothing ever came out of it."
540.0,Provider,"I mean, have you ever because I mean the gigs or someone can be under the table, have you thought about a different position that could be under the table."
15609.0,Patient,"i've been thinking about that I used to the other guitar player he used to hire me on and off. Working with him, but he's got three people are now so I can do that. Basically, the only thing I can do is play music everything else just kind of falls apart. i'm terrible at. repetition, I guess, even playing music turned into a you know, like basically a chore to get like a job and i'm like me lost all its glimmer I guess yeah. yeah I took a break from her for a long time, but now I just think of is like i'm gonna get practice in a bar and get paid to play they're getting paid to practice one yeah absolutely and if they don't like it too bad Who are they. can do better, you know. But. that's pretty much all it's left for me, other than something illegal and I don't even want to go there. yeah i'm too old for that kind of shit ain't gonna do that. None of that."
540.0,Provider,"But I do know it sucks right now. working through this part and knowing that though there aren't things that you can really change right now, but there are some things that you can do like like she can get in on her paperwork help out the situation it's not just all on you. And then, if you can get some gigs here and there, that could be extra but at paperwork probably going to be more of the at least you'd have that money, and you know that you'd have both yours and her money coming in. yeah if you had gigs that could be side money to do and get gifts and have that if you guys wanted to go out for something to eat but. To have like that constant money it's likely going to be on her end to."
15609.0,Patient,"You that's like that's I was kind of trying to push that Sir. make her more and more all peace. yeah yeah hell. Not I am not a good person to. put a lot of pressure stress, because I fall apart."
540.0,Provider,"Like once. I mean it's everybody it's I mean those are society it's not meant to be it used to be that one person could manage the household finances, but it's not."
15609.0,Patient,"A man, those are the work and the woman cooks here."
540.0,Provider,yeah but it's not that way. No.
15609.0,Patient,Even when it was I don't think it was either. yeah mostly.
540.0,Provider,"Mostly right. But being able to even if you sat with her and said, like hey like just write down the information and, like all put it in and you'll do like put the work in but. To have that paperwork in and squared away, just so that you can know that Okay, the ball is rolling something's happening on that and."
15609.0,Patient,yeah at least something yeah yeah yeah that probably today.
540.0,Provider,will make that one of our goals that will check in on so. Definitely yeah okay good all right.

I can't stand them things. there's a whole bunch of matter they're there they lay in the trees, like in the branches and just lay there, yes creepy. yeah like that.

540.0,Provider,Well subsidized housing.
15609.0,Patient,"I mean one thing I really pay is I go do some chores for the guy if he needs me to nail some you know so. But it's just all the other bills on top, I mean it would help. likes electric and things like them, but then it would I don't think it would equal out with rent so I can be like the same situation basically. yeah well i'm supposed to be. You know, helping the guy with his place and working on this place at the same time."
540.0,Provider,And what are you doing for his place.
15609.0,Patient,"Oh just whatever he needs like cut his grass or.
