Since mental health but alright so that's good but but to be honest with you, if they put you in a group of people were doing substance abuse, she would probably like that to. You know, most of these groups there's a lot of camaraderie people kind of reaching out to each other, and I think the group situation is really good. One of its unique group because, and particularly in the last year with Kobe and all that kind of stuff. There has been a lot of anxiety and now you have your specific situation because your parents and your your big move and everything but. In general there's been an increase in anxiety and the like, and and substance use because of all that. So did you meet with her once already."

Okay, and the funny thing is, is when I once I started doing it, I noticed it really helps with pain and I wasn't expecting that I wasn't doing it for pain, although I have chronic back pain. there's something about doing this guided body thing that I guess it just relaxed with each part of your body and the net effect is less pain, or something but. yeah it was one thing I noticed in part of the program was when I was learning to do it was journaling and I remember journaling it seems good book. So um but yeah those are those are great options so cognitive behavioral and in our personal Okay, and then there's one other one so well she's giving you some time to think."

Thursday I worked with a doctor, I was in California and because there's an urgent care out there, I still have a connection with, and he is moving to Kansas, with his kids he was his big thing was the schools in California. And he wants some somewhere different and I guess one of his he's got a kid third grade and what he was explaining name was all the kid was doing was addition, as far as math goes and he goes remember when you were an IRA at school, so we were doing multiplication tables and. yeah he said I send it to him, but what did the teacher say when she's going to move on, and she said something like after spring break they were going to learn multiplication well it's September spring breaks a bit of a way off."
14805.0,Patient,Right.
497.0,Provider,"You would think it's third grade and i'll fall you've got these kids doing is nine plus five and templates to that's their phone. yeah so he decided to take them out and and we're going with story is that the hospital is going to pay for his relocation and he found out that the moving company started $35,000."
14805.0,Patient,"Oh, my goodness."
497.0,Provider,"And he asked the moving company why in their comment was that they can't get truck truck. And then he's he's had incidents, the owner of this company is in incidents were on a day, they were supposed to move somebody the guided shock because he got a higher offer from somebody else so now he's resorted to outfitting everybody that's how it ended up being so expensive. yeah. yeah there's no shortage of truck drivers. Because I think. In long beach there's all these tankers out there and they can't even on mode because they don't have truckers to take."
