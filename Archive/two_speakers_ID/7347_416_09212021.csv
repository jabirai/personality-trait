7347.0,Patient,i'm doing okay just. put on our clothes in the dryer. Okay.
416.0,Provider,kids music and.
7347.0,Patient,"I had a pleasant thing on so they're able to charge you they both ate lunch just now, but they ain't really quickly, I am hoping, you would kind of stay distracted for a little bit, while I was on this call, but they finish quick what's going on for them to watch."
416.0,Provider,"And so what I what's new with I put in the inquiry, for your disability thing, did you get that."
7347.0,Patient,"I haven't called in, yet I just emailed. The like personal going back and forth with like the about it. I figure it with her she's calling the case managers, something I email just to make sure that it was sent over to my PCP and they just have I can't say that they that it was so I have to like call them and make sure that it's not sufficient, I haven't called my PCP yet."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. um yeah no problem, so I I i'm looking at your chart Melanie and you have so many no shows. Like. Most of your appointments or no shows, and the we're getting a lot of pressure to discharge you to maybe like an in person kind of situation since it seems like it's really hard for you to make it to appointments. what's what's interfering with you from you, being able to make it here and make it to group."
7347.0,Patient,"I was there yesterday and many kicked me out right, I move the camera away and he kicked me out, and I call back right away, and they said that, I told him I was nursing my baby and. So I just put the phone down and I like I told him usually truly or some tell him know that I do that on their phone with it, but maybe because it was my first time with him, he didn't know. They said they would let him know and let Toronto know. And then the time before that. I actually didn't realize, but I was at a waterpark I didn't realize that I had to guess for water park that day, and so I answered, and I just told him I know I am at a waterpark so I could I was sitting down I could have still did it, but he said it needed to be like a. Quiet place. yeah so I said Okay, well then, on he said just to see me next week, and so I was on this week and then he disconnected the call. So I called her back and spoke to compliant or yeah compliance and they said to just that they will let him know for future meetings so."
416.0,Provider,Okay i'm going to send him a message. and see what he has to say about that I. mean when you need to get this sorted. Okay hold on. How often are you nursing now.
7347.0,Patient,"every couple hours so. it's just like whenever he wants to now usually and then like. When he's going to sleep. More like just he's eating regular food, but he's still like is nursing right now."
416.0,Provider,I mean what's keeping you from keeping your camera on while you're nursing.
7347.0,Patient,"I had it on I just had it like facing up I just. I put it down, so it was basically like the ceiling."
416.0,Provider,So that okay.
7347.0,Patient,Not okay.
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So could you still keep the camera on your face, I mean it doesn't have to be on the rest of your body."
7347.0,Patient,"yeah it was just. Like. I put it. down because he was like getting on getting off like right now he's he'll nurse and then he'll sit up really quick. And like look at the TV can be restricted and i'll get back. down and he's going back and forth, so I. couldn't put it down because, like. I have to force anything on it, otherwise they start dripping everywhere so it's like not as you get a hold of phone and then like. pick him up from him walking away and like damn back on otherwise I just like legal. Because so nurse now for like. five seconds 10 seconds a minute and then stop whereas before like if i'm in my room. When it's quiet. nurse a nurse for like 10 minutes or something. And then he'll like empty, but if i'm looking for a minute, then. i'll just start leaking everywhere, he doesn't continue he's distracted. I have to be like the TV on."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay i'm emailing me right now, or messaging him. Okay, I just said i'm with Melanie to let me know that she put down the camera yesterday to nurse. During group, are you able to accommodate her occasionally nursing during the group i've clarified with her that she needs to camera on. During nursing, but it can obviously be just on her face and I just said she said she might struggle without a bit because her son is pretty wiggly but she will do our best. So we'll see what he has to say. Okay. All right, we'll see what manny's response. um okay So how are you doing with. The the assertiveness stuff that we've been talking about."
7347.0,Patient,"I think, better today, I had a chance to like kind of. use, it is a service, because one of my friends like I kind of not sure what to do now, because I want to go, but my my friend invited me to go eat with her like dinner, and I just told her like. she's inviting a friend of hers and I think she kind of like once to like. Set me up with this person. Okay, and I, I told her like i'm not ready for that and she's like well, we can just. Go have dinner, and I told her. i'm like not interested at all like I don't want to leave anyone okay being alone I just as long as like the kids are with me i'm fine you know, obviously, when i'm by myself completely, then I don't like it, but. I swear you know I also have to like do like. I have these like co parenting classes, I need to take for. For the custody stuff and I like to do that, and she kind of like made a comment, like my kids are going to see me alone and and not wanting love and I just was like. No it's because I like i'm okay being alone like I don't want to. If the alternative is just being like sad and crying all day long because someone's like not being nice to me then i'd rather like be alone. And so, and I feel like with the medication i'm just going to get to a point where like i'm not wanting to just be in bed or cry a lot so. I basically had a title like i'm not going to go, but I want to go but. I just told her like I. Maybe another time and then also like I just don't have the money for it like i'm wasting so much on attorneys that I just feel like. it's not smart for me to like be going out do you like a couple weeks ago we went and. She picture the seals and I was just like okay why don't know it's fine but i'm spending like 20 bucks on like. The smallest bit of food because I I basically ate a bunch of biscuits and got full and then didn't eat much else, and I was just like I just feel like it's not smart for me to like spend $20 every couple weeks. myself on my bread. So i'm gonna tell you that part but. I just told her like i'm i'll let you know, and that was it. But as far as like her kind of calling me on being like lonely or something I feel like I did a good job there. I didn't just I wish I could just say like. No, I don't want it, but then I feel like I like off the wrong way."
416.0,Provider,"I mean you have some really legitimate reason reasons to not want to go, so I mean that that makes sense and it sounds like you were able to express at least one of those reasons, like i'm just not ready, you know, thank you."
7347.0,Patient,"yeah I did tell her that, like I don't have the money for it right now, maybe if I do get disability in the future than I can you know, but I just I feel really guilty like. spending money when my kids aren't there, I guess, like spending so much i'm just myself when. I could spend $20 i'm like feed, all of us, if anything."
416.0,Provider,money's tight it's reality.
7347.0,Patient,Now.
416.0,Provider,What about with your axe how has happened going.
7347.0,Patient,"it's weird like some days when I dropped the kids off. he'll tell me or will tell the kids okay say bye bye to mommy and go over kisses and Stephen it's like okay that's nice know and then i'll do it. And then we'll go in and then, when he dropped some off it's like nothing like doesn't even and look at them in that I very rarely look into my eyes, I don't want to just like. seeing him just. I don't know like. He doesn't look with his eyes, sometimes he squinted like makes you like feel like you just like makes me feel bad like brings me back to these like. times when he was just so mean to me, and he, like squint and looked at me like what the look of disappointment or kind of were like discussed. So I don't look at them in the eyes, very much, but this one time I did, and he just like kind of rolled his eyes and looked away, and then I say one word to me just like any other kids and I went and I was it so it's just like very like. messes with my mind, because I wonder like, why are you like cordial at least sometimes as a manager, just like. No like I. didn't even say bye to the kids you just like get handed them over and like more toys. So I don't know it's like. And then I just overthink everything because i'm like are you and I sometimes worry not nice sometimes did I do something, or like."
416.0,Provider,Then you get on the. You go go straight for your. downward spiral.
7347.0,Patient,"yeah I just like like did he hear something does you think i'm doing something or something happened with the kids like. I don't know. When so. that's what happened on Thursday evening when they drop them off and then I was my weekend, so I didn't have to see him until today, this evening to see him so. I don't know."
416.0,Provider,you're doing an exchange tonight with the kids.
7347.0,Patient,I leave at five and drop them off at 530. And then. After five and then I get them back at 830. So it's just.
416.0,Provider,it's just for a few hours.
7347.0,Patient,"huh yeah on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he just hasn't for three hours and he's supposed to feed them and bathe them both. So, and then bring them back so it's kind of like easing them into to see. His first like. Nine months or so 10 months, he didn't like ever do anything to pay them anything really feed them at all, either so it's like the first step in our like custody agreement and. Mid October it's going to change them pretty sure he'll start getting overnights with Andrew then."
416.0,Provider,"And you're okay with that. I mean it's Okay, as you can be."
7347.0,Patient,"No, because he still nurses all night like it's he he nurses like to drink and then turns away in the States asleep, but he does it probably like two or three times a night still so i'm just. I just know he's going to wake up be crying and he's just gonna have to get rocked to sleep every time, like us, or I don't even know if he's taking a bottle and he's drinking regular milk with him or anything. So I asked him and he just will say like to eat sufficient amount a sufficient amount again doesn't tell me like a mistake in a bottle or anything so I don't know he's going to do anyway so trying."
416.0,Provider,To give him a bottle and get him back to sleep because he's the dad when he has to figure that out.
7347.0,Patient,"yeah so just feel bad for Andrew like. waking up and crying and i'm not there, he just wants to. nurse, sir. he's he's rubbing his eyes, I think he wants to. Take a. chicken out yeah I just put him. he'll have to. he's done again. here's the trash truck outside so he's like. I know he'll have to figure it out, I guess, I just realized that for. him like he's gonna hurt me in a month."
416.0,Provider,I mean it's it's that's the hardest part about being a mom right is letting go enough to trust somebody else with your kid.
7347.0,Patient,"And they're just so young, I just feel like. And Knowing his like temper and like how quickly things bother him I just like to like so small, like. How is he going to like when they both are crying or likely will need something at same time. I just temperature is going well."
416.0,Provider,What support does he have.
7347.0,Patient,"He has his parents, he can go to their like 30 minutes away so you can go there, but. He lives by himself, so he wanted to he could like. He could just go stay at his parents house and sleep over there, maybe. But I mean I kinda like in a way, I kind of hope that he will do that just to get the help, but I don't really want his parents raising the kids at all."
416.0,Provider,"They didn't do exactly a bang up job with him, did they."
7347.0,Patient,"died, and I just. That and I just feel like I mean seeing them every week like you know, once a week, even though it's not that bad, but I just feel like grandparents. shouldn't necessarily raise the kids at the other parents available and. And just I don't know I. mean if you find out who knows what's gonna happen right we don't know that that's what's going to happen."
416.0,Provider,"When if you find out your there's going to have to be a sense of one step at a time because there's, so much so much we don't know about how things are going to go. So thinking ahead and be like what if what if I don't want this, I do want this all of that is stuff you can't control, but it is there are things that you can respond to. When and if they come up right but sitting and worrying about them as difficult as it is to not do that is just increasing your anxiety and really taking you away from the moments of being with your kids right now."
7347.0,Patient,"that's very true yeah and I I. don't I do not so much like. And I caught myself sometimes kind of like realizing like i'm like thinking about this thing that like. Like, for example, school, the other day I was just like. Thinking for a long time to spend sitting and thinking like what's going to happen when I go to school, I know he's gonna fight me on it and it's not for like I guess, I was thinking about it, so I was thinking about like my oldest and she's gonna. be out of elementary in a couple years and she has a chance or alien phil have a chance to go to school together for like four months it's only time that they'll ever be like. The same able to go to school together so that would be when kaylee's right when katie drones five and February, she can go to school, until June with Bella. And, but then I started thinking okay well, what about when spoken about like is he going to fight me and want the kids to go to school, near him or you're going to us as parents address so they can go to school, but nice area. He doesn't live in here going down way down rabbit holes right now. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"it's I know it's hard not to have those thoughts pop into your head, but following down. Since my train of thought."
7347.0,Patient,"There, but the barn. The barn. Forget the secrets. Sorry."
416.0,Provider,"I was just saying that, following that train of thought down, you know down the rabbit hole is is really keeping you stuck so, can you think of some ways and skills that you might have to not start going down that rabbit hole."
7347.0,Patient,I don't have the skills to do that.
416.0,Provider,"I think you do. What could you consciously shift your mind to or what kind of counter statements, can you make in your own head to stop that train of thought."
7347.0,Patient,"I guess they're just like enjoying the time I have with the kids right now, like watching them play together that was doing today, they were like just playing together and laughing and stuff and it was like I wasn't thinking of anything else, it was just like their smile."
416.0,Provider,"So that's those are great counter statements, so it can be something like. i'm here with them right now. None of this has happened. it's not likely to happen. I will take things as they come out a lot get ahead of myself and let this take away from the. time I have. it's really about just staying focused staying present. Offering yourself those counter statements. it's hard because you're in a little bit of a rut right you're like you're in this rut that's keeping you in the cycle of thinking, all these negative thoughts. Challenging it's important."
7347.0,Patient,"This is hard, because every day, and I do it every single day and night it's always just comes down to like know in that one day they're going to be with him after me half the time i'm like so much in their lives they don't have to go through that with. CESAR few times a week like I just don't feel like i'm missing, so I look like i'm very involved with him. I just feel like I keep thinking i'm going to miss half of their life. involves this it at all."
416.0,Provider,"And the reality is that's not actually true. Even if they're with them with him that doesn't mean you don't get to go to their soccer practices or whatever it is they're doing while they're with him, I mean you'll still be going to the Games or somebody doing all of those things. But spending so much time worrying about all of that is keeping you from them right now yeah."
7347.0,Patient,"yeah. I thought about that too, like. I want to put it in something, because she watches this like. Cocoa melon thing, and she likes to like taekwondo thing I want to put her in it, and I think like you know I would definitely invite him to come watch her with whatever I put her in but I genuinely don't think he'll be the same, I don't."
416.0,Provider,have to invite you. To kids will tell you what they're involved in and you just go with mom.
7347.0,Patient,"I don't think he'll tell me, I think, like."
416.0,Provider,He doesn't have to you're entitled to know these things.
7347.0,Patient,I feel like if he ever enrolled right be like by his parents house far away and then he will he just won't tell me like he'll do it on time and then like I was never know about it.
416.0,Provider,"So once again you're way ahead of yourself, I feel like he might do this I feel like he might do that you don't know what your relationship is going to be with him when this happens. The world will be very different by that yeah. So you're just having these worst case scenario biggest fears realized keep coming into your head."
7347.0,Patient,Or you have to go.
416.0,Provider,"it's not fair mama. I hate it when you keep me safe mama. Time to like I feel you on that one. it's not fair. So Melanie I need to see my next patient, can we go ahead and schedule our next session Okay, and then we need to see you in group on a regular basis okay. Alright, so how about two weeks from now on October 5. um do you want to do like um. let's see how about. Will that work."
7347.0,Patient,My calendar.
416.0,Provider,"So on the fifth and also, we can do the 19th."
7347.0,Patient,Setting up my. reminders. Okay calendars. And then 19.
416.0,Provider,uh huh at 115.
7347.0,Patient,I put alarms on my phone. Okay.
416.0,Provider,"Good perfect great strategy. So your homework felony is stop following these negative thoughts down the rabbit hole. to shift. To find counter statements you do have these skills, but it's going to take a bit of practice. Okay. hang in there."
7347.0,Patient,"they're just it's like it's hard because. There were so small so it's like with bill it's like she was almost five you know, so I got to this. Special stuff. so tiny like."
416.0,Provider,"But nothing has happened yet they're still with you. Still there don't miss this time. Nothing has happened. you're worrying about the car crash before the car has even left the garage. Free fun. Big deep breath. ghosts gorgeous kids and I will. See you i'll See you in two weeks, and then i'll let manny know you'll be in group okay. All right, Melanie take care. Okay."
