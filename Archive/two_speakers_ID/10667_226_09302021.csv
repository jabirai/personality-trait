He was on me the entire night and the moment that I took my nipple away from his mouth, he would immediately start crying and like wake up and like desperately be like searching for my breasts and. It was like really, really like tiring for me, I was thinking, maybe like an hour an hour and half. Like the entire night. wow so.

Any like stories like played in screen. yeah."
226.0,Provider,Okay well how are you Mike How are things going.
10667.0,Patient,"So, like since we've talked. i'm feeling, really, really depressed and. I just felt like this overwhelming cloud of sadness over me for like no reason, and I would like cry constantly and I was like Oh, my goodness it's like a one time thing. I feel like I should be fine tomorrow or something, and it was like recurring so like for sure for sure five pastry Alice just like fried. And to have those times I just felt it really, really crippling and I was in bed, and I could not get up like Robert would like literally physically trying to get me out of bed and. He just said, why do you feel extremely heavy right now, like i'm not calling you're firing thing, but I just I cannot basically pick you up, I know that I don't know and like to sleep me here and who is like no like you cannot be crying and like this, like it's not good for you. And I was like I don't want to do anything else. And he was insistent on like me going to the gym or like me point out for a walk or me like. You know. going to grab a snack or something and I told him like I really didn't want to do anything I just wanted to lay there, and like be left alone, and he was like no I don't think that's a good idea. And i'm saying, please just like leave me I don't know why i'm sad I don't know why i'm crying. I just. Am and then he told me, you know I wish there was something I could do for you, and then I told him like I don't. I don't like understand why I continue to feel this way because I usually, when I would like, think of my ex husband or something or like. memory would trigger than that kind of side and sometimes I would like cry a little bit, but it was never like like that and I actually hadn't really been thinking about him until like the last two days, but I just kind of got sad but it didn't like make me cry or like you know. or anything like that, so I thought. You know before I was excited how sharp crying because I would like thinking about my husband or my ex husband or something but. I haven't thought of anything that makes me feel sad or anything like that, like, I cannot pinpoint like a memory, or like that song that has made me feel the way that i'm feeling and then. I did end up going to the gym and it was like it was only distracting during the time that I was there. Because, after I kind of felt like. Like I don't feel like this, or like even when I was at the gym I wasn't really feeling out is very, very forced to go. yeah so I didn't like I didn't put my all into like the workouts I just kind of like point and like this something, just like go and do something, not because I was like really looking forward to it, like others days. yeah and I can't like Barbara would tell me what you're going to see here and they cry why it will go to the gym and do something and i'll think and literally just like. Like 10 minutes away walking so I told him like what I don't want to go and then you tell people you're paying for it and, like it's good for you, the most I don't want to go anymore like I don't want to do anything and I stay here and then. After those like five days, where I felt, really, really feeling depressed. There it like this week, I felt moments Dorothy so like. Before like proper gets home from work, but I feel like think, all we can you get home already because he really wants to like you to hug me or something or like I just I don't know, like, I just want. Like someone else's presence. And then, and then I felt like yesterday um I gotta vote like I need to do something for me, so I went in like on my toes done and I like I went on a breakfast state with my fail and I like to be like to go service my car and stuff and. actually fall a lot better ustream. And then also. So I was like felt more depressed than usual, and I told tanya about it, and she actually prescribe me. Another medication i'm not sure how to pronounce it, but basically what he said she also told me that the abilify I was born good was like weight gain. And I told her that I was being way. And it was feared because i'm i've been consistently going gym like. Except for like those five days right just. To not. Fully like inky until like my workouts but I was still going, you know still doing some activity as opposed to going on and. and told her and i'm gaining weight, which is kind of weird because i'm not even like you know i'm i'm like being pretty accurate, I would take myself to the park and like just there, I would like to do activities with him. And I, but I did tell her like I am crazy like ice cream, like the first thing I wake up in the morning I don't eat it, but I just crave it or like ice cream you like. really like unhealthy food and if I don't eat it, but I just like crazy it really bad and i'm learning and gaining weight and then shows like on the video is some of the side effects. Of the medication so she still can me on the abilify she's going to go up on it to 10 milligrams but she kept us to sound like five and then she also told me to take another one i'm gonna take a look at bedtime because it does date me. so hard don't convert. lamb lamb lamb a tree. or. Our aurobindo i'm not sure. yeah I didn't have to take the. Last night before I went to sleep drink at that time and I had to like the boost boost bar and. abilify in the morning and yeah but. I mean. I don't know."
226.0,Provider,So um So where are you in your menstrual cycle.
10667.0,Patient,"and So i've always kind of been irregular. And I don't like always have a period and then every now I have an iud so. I was actually told that okay so there's like the hormonal and the non hormonal. So I have the hormonal one and I was told that this. kind of like makes you bleed every month, but I have it so i've had it for. About three months now, and I had to like a period yeah and I had that period. right before I started going to the gym so a month ago, because I was going to jump out there."
226.0,Provider,"So, even though you don't have like an actual period like actual menstrual flow your body is still cycling, as if you know, like."
10667.0,Patient,I was on my period.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so what I want you to keep track of is. Like. When the depression hits during the month, you know. Like maybe the medication will. Our hope right is that yeah that's going to help you where you, you know balance out your mood a little bit so you don't have those low low. Okay. and your low lows have been farther and farther and farther apart right. Here, which is really good. So, even on medication, you can still experience that, but obviously the goal is to try and find new medications for that doesn't happen so. where you have days, where you feel sad but then you can just push through you can go to the gym you can do a breakfast date with Mattel like you know you don't have to be in bed that's that's what we're not wanting. But you know just out of curiosity, you know, keep track of. What days. Your depression is hitting during the month and I would look at it, as like. Okay, so like you get your you know period every 28 days and kind of back it up from the last day of your period and see you know when the depression is hitting i'm just curious if it's. The hormonal as well, as you know, maybe just a chemical imbalance I think there's there definitely is a chemical imbalance. which creates that depression, for you. Also, you know you just stopped breastfeeding too so don't forget that your body's. Still adjusting okay. hormonally it's still adjusting. When women stop breastfeeding, even though you wanted to that's like a huge loss for some women. that's can be really hard. Like it just feels like oh no, you know cuz that's a way of bonding with the baby. and your time together, and you know. You know that's what you've been doing since he was born so maybe pay attention to some of that as well, but I it sounds like you're like you were ready to stop breastfeeding so. and Just things to be aware of you know, just like like tracking your you know tracking your moods like keeping kind of like a diary like. Sometimes, what I have clients do is create keep a depression diary. And then they just write down the dates the days, you know that their depression hit every single month and then you go back and you look. And then, sometimes you're able to make correlations but you know you did a really good job you're trying to think of like Okay, is that thought, creating this depression it didn't seem like there was nothing that you could identify right."
10667.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,still something to be mindful of okay.
10667.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"You know all of that stuff plays a part, you know I don't think that I don't think we talked a lot I don't think we talked enough about hormones and how it plays into women's depression. And I don't think there's enough of a discussion about that. Because we're expected just give her. be okay go back to work or stay at home, be a stay home mom that's still isolating you know they're still you know there's still. boredom that comes you know from being a stay home mom. there's boredom from having to go to work to."
10667.0,Patient,Get.
226.0,Provider,"So it's about keeping your life in balance as much as you possibly can. And if you're really aware of like how you're feeling and thinking and tracking all of this stuff it makes it a little bit easier, not something you have to do for the rest of your life but it's really great for kickstarting some awareness. And I love, how you just went to the gym even if you didn't do. The workout that you would normally do you're still moving your body you're still getting out of the House, that is what you need to do that perfect. profession has to be managed anxiety has to be managed, how you manage it is how it's about finding what works for you, you like going to the gym so you go to the gym go for a walk. You go for a drive whatever works for you that's managing or depression. That means you're taking it's not controlling you, to the point where you're just. You know, wiped out. about being able to control it. Though it doesn't have full control over you. So let's see how the medications do too i'm curious hopefully that will really make a difference. yeah so it's really hard to feel. depressed like that you know. You know, and just like so heavy in your body. And it's interesting, you know that Robert noticed that to. You know that heaviness, though. And that, having this isn't only. Physical having us but it's mental and emotional happiness too. So it's very symbolic. So it's about how do you lighten your load. You know how do you make things lighter, how do you make things easier, how do you make things flow easier in your life. Like, how do you create that for yourself like that's something you can focus on to like okay. Like what what's going to bring me happiness, right now, because you know. One thing can be a small thing, but what will work. Staying focused on that. puzzle so don't forget that depression makes you very fatigued."
10667.0,Patient,"These, I was just like really tired and tired be. yeah and my sleep was really heavy. marvel would tell me I don't know if it's because you're going to the gym or what is happening, but my alarm is like really loud and you don't wake up to it and I turn on the light and you don't even move. you're like. you're literally like looking at it or not looking at it, but like you're right underneath it so i'm like i'm not sure if you're like really, really exhausted from like working out or something but. Guy you're like don't even move, and then, I guess, he would tell me that you would like kind of wake me and tell me. That you know, he was leaving to work hard, and he told me, I would talk to him and tell him okay like you know, have a good day. You should take your lunch and take your water bottle and he would be like guide like I always do you know, and you said I told him i'm just making sure, and then. I would tell her all close the door and then she would say, oh no it's final thoughts no continue sleeping and in the mornings, I would be like why didn't you waking up when you left and he was like What do you mean I did. Like you're you're talking to me, you know say I don't remember like I don't know say I don't know if you're just really tired and then like during those days, also moto would like crawling to our read our tell him. How is it tomatoes coming to the room like I don't remember going to pick him up because they can you grab them. Well, I know, like what the heck like I don't remember that if you say why is your sleep so heavy I was sitting, I was like I don't know but I didn't notice that those were the days, where I felt really depressed. Because I didn't remember myself come into her bedroom or he would say oh my to come into the room and I put them on the bed for you, because you didn't even move on. and say wow like did you make a noise and he was like I was like. He wouldn't cry was kind of like whining because he couldn't get on the bed, and I could have opened or something I know. Pretty shocked that I wasn't able to remember or now my soup is really, really like heavy and because I am a very light sleeper. yeah but i'm not sure why. I would literally wake up in the sprinklers turn on outside. So I got it was really weird."
226.0,Provider,So what. Was that when you were just really depressed is that when that was happening.
10667.0,Patient,"yeah that's what that was like last week and the week before i'm just like a couple of days, because some days like yeah I would remember when I was looking for something or I would. I would like ask him, something and I could remember the next air his alarm went off or I would feel when he would get up from the bed and wake up. Like some days, I guess, he just said, I wasn't. I didn't even flinch when I would turn on the light or something and I thought that was really weird."
226.0,Provider,"tells you right how much yeah I mean that's that's that's kind of like an indication of like a chemically in the body and the brain. You know it's creating that I mean it's not bad, you know. it's just it's just kind of what it is."
10667.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"So just keep tracking you know, keep keep working out keep tracking your moods I keep tracking the days you know. Doing stuff that's really that you like self care good things for you it's really important this hugely important really, really important self care so important right now. Being a mom it's it's not easy. Okay."
10667.0,Patient,You know it's.
226.0,Provider,"It feels it's it's a lot got a lot of responsibility, even though you have a partner, and you guys live together, you know the days that was the tail and yeah it's exhausting so you need to be able to make sure that you're taking some time out for yourself."
10667.0,Patient,"yeah and I kind of so before it was really hard to kind of link proper understand. yeah like mental illness and stuff and, at times, it still is um and then, when. When he doesn't fully understand like. i'm not either like in the mood to explain it to him or I just don't know how to get across to him and that's when I kind of think back to my husband of how. We we have like a lot of issues but. Honestly, he was very, very. Aware of like mental health. yeah and he would. Like he, like he always treated to sponsor feels like a flu, or something you know, like you're here, you need to take care of me taking medication for something and who is very um. um I guess like understanding of my depression and he always tried to came to me and I didn't really have to say much for him to understand me i'm Robert I kind of have to like break everything down a little baby. yeah. And it's kind of like frustrating at times and. I mean it's still is, but it used to be a lot more and leave me. He tells me, you know what's the gym every time I have to go to a store to like coal fire like a shower curtain or so i'm just wondering like how are we going to share we're going to spill the water out. And you tell me okay go ahead Take your time to call the time that means walk around the whole store if you need to fire yourself or anything else they might need or anything else you want, and then he's like i'll take my card like coffee for anything. yeah and it didn't used to be like that. yeah I feel like. A lot more. That I guess."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and I think like we were talking last week I he realizes how much you do and how hard it is. yeah when you guys were sick. yeah I mean he got to actually like he visually saw it. And so My guess is that that was huge for him, like he was like that was eye opening. um and the good thing is that kids really wanting to understand it like he gets that it's like you're not just doing it to do it. You know yeah you're doing it because you're truly depressed. yeah so that's a positive right."
10667.0,Patient,"yeah and then like father's day. So, like, I have only fridge and it didn't it didn't break fully okay macphail hung like he was hanging from the door, so now, the door would and close so that meant like. The fridge started surfing, and then I think Robert was like why doesn't the fridge door closed. You can ask your son like he he hung himself on the door and I won't fully. And he said, well, what do we do and i'm. not sure how to fix it I think my dad said that, I have to like pick up the door and like alignment and then screw buck on. yeah I would have to like empty it out. And like put it on its side and then he goes and then he told me what i'm just building a new one knows like well because, if things are fixable wiring and you get a new one and he's he doesn't care like about spending money he just. wants something to work. So, then, I thought okay well if you're gonna buy it when i'm let's go get another one so and then. got the day before we went to go get fridge he had clean the apartment he's like. I mean family tidy up you like suck them up and to wash dishes or something. And then they be quite frank, I like on box and everything and I told him well i'm not sure if you're going to like it, because doesn't have like a light bulb inside and it's smaller than the old friend who used to have, and he was like well then let's return it and I was like. I just unbox it and also okay well, if you want to return to the back of the box, because I am boxing and if you don't like it well, then you box it up. And then he told me modesty when I get home so he's at home and his thing I guess it's already I guess we'll Keep it up, because I told him, you really, really do all that work for nothing, and then he was like this whole apartment was cream yesterday. And i'll say. yeah I know it is like I know it's a senior what it's like you know, like and I told him I am so tired and he was like what you know, and he was like like what is it that makes her like i'm. concerned, and I was like I can't cook that's why so I used to, because what they want something or do something on he's reading she's reading and dogs book right now."
226.0,Provider,Okay. yeah.
10667.0,Patient,"wow wow wow wow. So yeah I told him I know only i'm sorry I can't I can't do something without having to do like 60 million things at the same time. yeah and then I did laundry late that night who. yeah and he told me oh it's like almost midnight, and I have to get up at three to to work so. i'm going to go to sleep, is with us so she already knows like i'm just going to clean up a little bit and then i'll go. And I didn't clean up a little bit I cleaned everything like I moved the couches and I clean and I think I want to see where like 130 thousand two deep cleaning and i've found that it's a lot easier to do and we're closely. And, especially at night he's in a deeper sleep and if he just NAPs."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
10667.0,Patient,"So i'm i'm able to do more so when Robert got up to go to work out three. He said I saw everything is so clean and I thought to myself wow she really does like clean all day and all night. And then me and my token and make such a huge mess. feels like and I felt that I felt like oh my God I don't even want to like grab a dish to like eat breakfast because i'm going to dirty and he's like and then I don't watch them before I leave work I just leave every morning and he's like i'm sorry and. You know, but like the fact that he's actually take these things into the story. Here, a huge."
226.0,Provider,Absolutely.
10667.0,Patient,"You know, and then sometimes he'll come, you know just go to sleep with me because he knows I a cleaner night. So, yesterday I went to the gym. And i'm I know this because i've been feeling a little more sensitive lately, but if he says something that kind of upsets me I get really, really, really like irritated or frustrated or something and, like the other day I told him. Do you think you can take them offline go to the gym and here's a Gala. And then. crowd I did I do like. But actually go out and like bring up a chair, and so, then I came home and my thought was I thought his toys, he was making a mess everywhere and I thought to myself, like. I have to do all these areas, and they still have to deal with our sun all day I, I think, for the first booking type deal with the team."
226.0,Provider,Right.
10667.0,Patient,"Now so. And not just not just handle like the tours to. Right so. hey he is is because his mom and that's not really the issue reason like she taught them to do things but they never really had to do it themselves with the show instead of for them and. So. She doesn't like see this tours around the House or that he takes care of his son so like she was gone it Okay, with the fact that I was going to the gym and he was like going to visit by himself with my girl. because she said that not like we're kind of we're kind of a wife like this that and I guess it's like his. Father has a brother. Two years younger than him and he's been married for like 10 years to emerge, really, really young, but like his wife also had a really bad postpartum depression and she. She went to the gym also like that was her way to cope with it so she went to the gym and like that's where the mountain like in La for saw you know that the. girl was referring to like take care of herself is take her her family, but she did it, she has like three different views of like you know responsibilities himself so. They she started crying when Robert told her, I was going to the gym because she said that she didn't want the same can happen. To Robert that his other brother, but his other brother he doesn't like he never complains about like Oh, I have to cook and clean and they take care of my daughter because he's like he has a completely different mindset. And he's like yeah like my own, my wife works so and I work, so you know we have babies have it in front of responsibility, like it's my two and the houses, both of ours, so we both have to make sure that it's clean, like the mom doesn't like that feels like. it's the girls responsibility always and I was telling Robert like hey I kind of need you to separate the clothes, that I can likewise from barks and colors I can wash and then clean wash the dishes and like St my mom and she was like I don't like being left the list. And i'm like well, I mean if I don't tell you what to do, and I feel we can have them do it, and then he told me. If something needs to be done, then i'll do it, like the first dishes or 30 all washed him, I know that I nice weekend like you told me that earlier. And I volunteered to do it, but now you're like putting other things on my plate, and I told him was like I don't tell you to separate the clothes, I know you're not going to do it because you don't know that it needs to be done, I, but I do and. Like it's your clothes also like I need to watch student of your uniforms. or work and not because i'm running out of clothes, because I have plenty. For and he's told me like oh I don't like being told what to do, I thought okay that's fine so that I started washing dishes and I started like separating the clothes. And he was a college i'm already like i'll do it, and I was like no, because obviously you don't like being sold to so i'll go ahead and do it. Now, because I can't do it, but because I don't think it's fair that I get everything put on me, on top of everything already do. And I understand that you're working you're tired and everything, but you do have responsibilities at home, because you have a family and you're not single anymore and either way if you were single either your mom does or you do it, but there's no, you know. And then I thought was really mad, and I was like. I was so mad I was like on the verge of like crying but I did is just really, really mad that I just felt like. hey I was upset that little things like that gets me, but I was feeling like he wasn't understanding like says he does. But I mean that's just some days like I said the other day she was like and I realized that you keep them all the time and so just make a mess for you, but i'm like little things like that, like oh I don't like being told what to do, or like Why do I have to do it. Those kinds of things, make me upset obviously because I feel like I should I suppose a broken record."
226.0,Provider,telling them.
10667.0,Patient,"You know you have responsibilities at home with your son with me and I shouldn't have to clean all day you should help me and I shouldn't have to take care of all day all day, to use your son also if you want your stepson. You need to help the care of him either like healthy changes hyper or baby thing or putting him to sleep because. You know it's easier and it's more helpful if you help me paint to sleep, he says he's not he doesn't. want your breasts you know. Right so. Is that easier and. I get it takes her while but I mean he does. You know, get around to understanding, but then there's time charge to like everything and i've tried to make him understand who just does about the window and access something done."
226.0,Provider,"So sometimes This is like a work in progress so. I mean what you're describing is that he's come. A long way. From like where it was. So he actually is. He is involved. Like he knows what needs to. be done, I think he has a greater appreciation and understanding of what you do every day. that's huge. Okay, so some of the other stuff that gets frustrating it's just constantly like reminders letting them know that this this bothers you can we talk about this is really frustrating for me, trying to come to a compromise. around it and it will feel exhausting because you're just doing it over and over and over then sometimes sometimes you're picking your battles right there's some things that just. won't change.
