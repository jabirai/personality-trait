759.0,Provider,"All right, anything you want to talk about today."
14567.0,Patient,"gosh i'm well i'm. I don't know no, no, no, none of it seems super important um the other, the other day. I was really sleepy during the day and. Then, when i'm when I woke up like I wasn't a i'd forgotten a couple things, since when I lay down for my nap and so that, like me, you know my my husband and my friends. They know that I was sneaking around drinking, which I was, and so, when that happened, I was like Oh, I hope they don't think i'm drinking, but they said they don't."
759.0,Provider,So they said that they don't okay.
14567.0,Patient,They didn't think I was drinking.
759.0,Provider,It didn't think you were drinking okay.
14567.0,Patient,Right and I wasn't.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14567.0,Patient,i'm at like 81 days or something like that today.
759.0,Provider,"that's good that's really good celebrate each day given if I I used to work with this one clinician and you always tell them using the recovery himself give it just 24 hours you know for the next 24 hours i'm sober keep a day by day, you know."
14567.0,Patient,"You don't have definitely had those days, a while."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. So just be able to keep it, focusing in on 24 hours moment by moment you know. yeah. Okay anything else that's been on your mind lately."
14567.0,Patient,i've been pretty irritable.
759.0,Provider,irritable okay. And irritable can be a symptom of you know bipolar being really you know. Having irritation with people and different things of that nature so being able to just be aware of that you're all in what ways.
14567.0,Patient,"I don't think I really thought of being irritable as a symptom of bipolar but I suppose it would be. I just said things just seem to irritate me a little bit more than they normally would just the interaction, I had at work today with a Co worker who. You know, like i'm supposed to delegate responsibilities to her, and when I was talking about, you know needing her to do something she just kept laughing and talking about how much work she had to do and it's like well yeah but. I have my work that I can't do that you can't do so I you know. So there was that a patient's wife that call to yell at me about the ambulance delay, which was of course not my fault i'm. You know little things."
759.0,Provider,Just little things yeah yeah that sounds like pretty irritating you know.
14567.0,Patient,"Well, oh here's a really good example um so. My husband will put cat treats on the bed for the cats to eat, which is fine, but then they don't quite finish them all and they just sit there, and so I came in here today. And I saw the cat treats I scooped them all up into my hand and I was about to go out there and throw it throw them at him. And then I realized that was not a good idea, and so I didn't do that."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm so you having to manage kind of like your impulses too. yeah yeah well, it does sound like things are you know, even though we want even killed mood you know it just seems like there is some situations. That you're dealing with that are kind of like maybe annoying maybe frustrating. You know, but you can always choose not to react, you know react in a different way, instead of being irritated you know you can choose your reaction, you know wanna be level headed about it and not feel so irritated and let other people's moods are things that you're doing affect you."
14567.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"I have you ever heard that quote life is 90% or no life is 10% of what happens to us and 90% of what how we react to life so it's all like in your reaction, you know, like sometimes you know we can choose how we would react."
14567.0,Patient,"Well um. I probably heard, most of the sayings that you have, including that one but sayings or sayings for a reason so for sure."
759.0,Provider,"Okay okay yeah that's one of my favorite quotes because sometimes it's true. yeah it's mostly you know how we react to things you know, like and we can choose, you can choose how people might treat us, or what other people might do, but we can choose our reaction to how we want to react to the world."
14567.0,Patient,We have.
759.0,Provider,Our power and our reaction. and control over our reaction.
14567.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"So if you don't want to feel so irritated you know you can practice a coping skill, maybe you know, like drunk lean about it or experience. i'm talking about it with a friend been talking about it, talking about in therapy what you're doing right now. You know, ways to cope with it right. yeah yeah. yeah so any other incidents. you give me a look."
14567.0,Patient,"No i'm. i'm just trying to think, to be honest."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14567.0,Patient,that's really all that that that comes to mind right now.
759.0,Provider,"Okay. Would you say your mood has been stable since the last time we that we talked. Okay, good."
14567.0,Patient,yeah fairly.
759.0,Provider,"fairly okay good. And no kind of like high risk situations that she came across you know, like I think we're discussing we're going to be talking about your triggers. You know, like where your triggers you know either behavioral are they can be emotions aren't it can be something that you know you need to work on, so when you're hit with something that might be a lot to how though you don't go back to your to you know drinking. Which yeah you know so. What do you think is the number one trigger that leads you to relapse."
14567.0,Patient,"Oh gosh. Oh. I would probably have to give that one some thought that would be a tall order, because you know everything's a trigger you're happy you drink your said, your dream your board you drink."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so I want to have you learn what your trigger was last time you start using you know what happened. You know, was it kind of because I feel like with each relapse you can learn from the relapse in terms of you know not what to do next time to prevent relapse for from occurring does that make sense."
14567.0,Patient,"yeah it does um. I mean I you know, I was in that that forced forced sobriety program for nurses, which. Was ended in February of this year. And I relapsed about a month or so later and. The answer to why relapsed was because I could."
759.0,Provider,Because he could because he could drink.
14567.0,Patient,Because I wasn't getting I wasn't getting like random drug tested and they test for alcohol to yeah basically I wasn't going to get caught.
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you weren't when you say that you weren't ready to be sober at that point, you know you have been forced into going to rehab for the nurses broke down and then, once you get out you got out after a month, you know, like since no one's monitoring me, you know I can drink."
14567.0,Patient,yeah i'm.
759.0,Provider,gonna be accountability. You need accountability. That.
14567.0,Patient,"I mean, I guess, it would depend on what you mean by that someone to answer to."
759.0,Provider,"Know someone to, for it could be not answered to like someone to hold you accountable, you know, like your program here hold you accountable by. The uds you know, like the urine drug screens, you know by you participating in groups and dare P, you know some type of accountability for the program that you're working. You know, like a Members, you know hold each other and accountability, you know, for, for you know, by making it to meetings and doing things of that nature working the program you know so. Maybe it's a lack of you know, having something to answer not answer to but something to be there to say like okay i'm not going to drink, because I know like you know i'm. I have to do you know X y&z in my program and I can't do that you know, because if i'm not sober like I have to show up you know for myself in a way."
14567.0,Patient,"Well, external accountability is I don't think what I need. Like i'm already going to am already in therapy, I am honest with all of those people."
759.0,Provider,"are sure you're staying accountable to yourself, then."
14567.0,Patient,I mean that's ultimately what I am having to do.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
14567.0,Patient,"But just not God either that's a good way to put it to. yeah I mean it, it has it has to be for me ultimately that doesn't mean there's no rules and nobody cares. But this whole oh somebody is going to catch me and i'm going to get in trouble if I drink no I don't I don't need that right now."
759.0,Provider,"You know, like to say that you do need it or not, you know it's just that you know you having a program working your steps and stuff like that keeps you accountable to either yourself, or to the program itself, but you know, there is some accountability. And, but it's, not to say that that's what triggered you, you know, maybe just not having you know the right type of structure, you know when you got back home, and maybe you not buy into your recovery, you know, because you were forced to go into rehab at that time. here."
14567.0,Patient,yeah um. I mean yeah I was definitely not ready to quit and you have to understand i've I have been in overly overly overly strict environments for most of my life childhood and adulthood. mm hmm and and so it's. um. It you know I don't know if I was rebelling against that program it's it's. it's hard to say i'm. yeah i'm not even i'm not even sure I could. I could tell you the answer I just I had not decided to quit. It was decided for me.
759.0,Provider,Are you.
14567.0,Patient,"yeah I I tried, I really did like I wanted to be done i'm recognized how bad it was for me, but with all the restrictions lifted, it was like I had to go and be stupid and then remember that i'm stupid and you know well mission accomplished."
759.0,Provider,mission accomplished.
14567.0,Patient,yeah wow. That that idea.
759.0,Provider,yeah so what what's the takeaway from that.
14567.0,Patient,I mean. Make making someone do something is is not going to actually make them want to do it.
759.0,Provider,"Okay yeah when someone's not ready to change, you know and to change a behavior in this case, you know stop using substances."
14567.0,Patient,You know.
759.0,Provider,"it's hard to make someone do that. You know, you know, like the takeaway is is that I hadn't brought into my recovery at that point, you know, like because it was designed the recovery program was designed to make me feel you know, like are designed to make me do something I didn't want to do it that way."
14567.0,Patient,"yeah well, I mean it was I was not really asked it was like you do this or you find a new job and."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
14567.0,Patient,yeah so.
759.0,Provider,"Are the at the time, but now you're ready. Oh yeah yeah."
14567.0,Patient,"Yes, most definitely. I get. Like I look back and my thought was I trying to do just remind myself how terrible it is when I drink okay."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So that's remind yourself, you know how terrible it is when you drink."
14567.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"OK. So now, you know, like being sober and you see kind of like looking back you're able to you know put things into perspective that now I want my to be sober. down and have worked on maintaining my sobriety now i'm going to get the treatment, I want for myself, you know, in order to maintain my sobriety. Right good. Okay, carry anything else on your mind."
14567.0,Patient,I don't think so.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, are you offer Where are you located, by the way, are you in California or different States."
14567.0,Patient,yeah i'm in California. San Diego.
759.0,Provider,Oh you're in San Diego. Okay nice nice yeah i'm over here by la been burbank. Oh yeah yeah alright so rhonda did you just get home from work. yeah so you probably tired anyways okay.
