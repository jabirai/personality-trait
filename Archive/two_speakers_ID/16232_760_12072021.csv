760.0,Provider,Hello allison.
16232.0,Patient,"Oh, that was literally only a few seconds."
760.0,Provider,"yeah it was like two minutes I need to give a full two minutes. Just to be sure, because I don't want to mix your appointments. So it's at this point, I guess the windows past so i'd rather just kind of get started and kind of see how you are."
16232.0,Patient,"How have you been since the last. i'm going Okay, so it was it was good, I think, actually, I think that and. A little different."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so describe that from you what What about it was an eye for an eye opener I like that breeze."
16232.0,Patient,"um well I didn't realize, I still have certain feelings oh. There we go. I didn't realize. I didn't realize I had like like. Those feelings inside still I thought I was you know kind of over it already and it's."
760.0,Provider,Just.
16232.0,Patient,"Like i'm phase, but I realized it's. Really, not a phase. I think what happened was that. Like what you said, going through, I guess kind of a trauma like that, over time, it does become that and even though I can be forgiving or about certain people and things. it's still affected my self esteem and hence like as time went by a lot of my decisions and I probably had a lot to do with that and maybe I didn't see at first. Because you begin to normalize something after a long time if you're in that situation, even though it's not normal like you get so used to being there, it becomes like second hand you don't think twice about it, and I think that might have happened over time."
760.0,Provider,And yeah.
16232.0,Patient,"I guess that that's why I, I can be certain ways that are not so great, or I feel a certain way that's not good, and it starts to affect like my daily life. yeah yeah good man made the puzzle come together and i'm like oh great. So, now that I realized it, as is definitely a self esteem issue based on these things now next step, I guess what you said, would be to to like find coping mechanisms, so I don't like freak out or."
760.0,Provider,"Skills I like the word better skills, because there's there's like maladaptive coping mechanisms and that's those are things that could be destructive to be could be addicting kinds of things even something so simple as like eating the wrong food too much. Things like that and be maladaptive coping mechanisms so coping skills is you know something more balanced something more positive that kind of builds a balanced life that you kind of find yourself and and you cope with your day to day stress, there is, and your emotions that way. So so i'm glad that you got something out of that last session."
16232.0,Patient,"We like one, but like it really made me think oh."
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay okay so you're contemplate or me yeah. Yes, I think what I think what happens is like emotions are not. Really, sometimes they can be illogical. You know, and we can know with our head this person is not the same as she was when we were kids but the emotions believes or feels something different. You know, and then there's such a thing as like a trigger like you can get triggered old negative thought patterns can be triggered by by something that reminds you of. That bad experienced person or perhaps going to the same place. or some something that you associated The thing that you associate or or even just an emotion, so we can get triggered to go back to our past traumas and and the brain kind of. Sometimes people's brains get wired in such a way that they it's almost like they're literally are living back there in the past. You didn't know it."
16232.0,Patient,"Until it happens. Like okay like i'm fine, but no."
760.0,Provider,"Because it feels normal that's just what you're accustomed to. us too, and so. yeah yeah so that's that's part of it, and so that's the whole concept of mindfulness. Right, you know mindfulness is a concept, where. We try, we learned how to to use our senses and be in the present moment. You know, with the intention of of like learning how to cope with that because that's what when people suffer with and you don't have ptsd right."
16232.0,Patient,"I know you have Rama. And I was diagnosed with depression, but that was about it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, but you, you did have I remember the last conversation you've described in great detail about. The bad experiences, you had. And so that's a traumatic experience and so sometimes the brain. kind of takes us back there even to be around somebody who reminds us of that trauma can. trigger that memory can trigger the same stress hormones, that the fight or flight stuff and get triggered from just a memory it doesn't even have to be in the situation."
16232.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay hold on a second I heard a beat by need to make sure. Okay, all right now Okay, she didn't come in, I just wanted to make sure there isn't another person in okay um. So okay so that's some good insight on your part. Now, before we go on no I wanted to ask you, because I noticed, there was a. A. I think this was some sort of the week about a week or so, or maybe longer ago you had filled out a survey, where you weren't feeling satisfied with the services, I think that."
16232.0,Patient,Was not prior to our. session yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Well, I, I know, but I just want to make sure that you're getting all your needs met and all the different aspects, not just when you're meeting with me but. Is there anything that you think needed to be done, different or something you need to say about the services you receive prior or, at any time, really."
16232.0,Patient,"yeah there were a couple of things like I had one rude. What angellist or something. I think he was Jennifer I meant to contact them supervisor the ICC money, so I think. That it just I kind of just like whatever I just ended up not doing it i'm like Maybe she was having a bad day or whatever. And then another time on the cats oh I got an email for. More lab work and even though I had already submitted the lab work. I saw I was like i'm a little worried i'm like are they keeping track collecting. You know, I was the question it and. Like little things, maybe, things are not as organized or I remember getting disconnected a few times, it was just such a long process, just to talk to someone or just for someone to say."
760.0,Provider,Can idea. You know they.
16232.0,Patient,Common maybe I don't know.
760.0,Provider,"yeah I think there's an intake process. And I don't think you told me you didn't have a whole lot of experience with therapy wrecked my remember. Remembering that right. Okay, so there's a process and with bright heart health what we do, we we gather a lot of a lot of surveys. And the whole purpose of the surveys in it, I know it can feel like a lot but, but the purpose of those surveys, is to kind of pinpoint the direction of the treatment so there's there's a. there's there's a positive reason for. So you know, and I know something maybe sometimes people might feel overwhelmed by that. kind of with the surveys were not a problem, no, it was just."
16232.0,Patient,"Know they're fine. I think it was just more of a. They were a bit disorganized like i've even gotten i've sent responses back an email saying oh this link you sent me isn't completely can you read. This specific link and then it never got answer, but instead I got please fill out this link and i'm like."
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so what we're trying to go."
16232.0,Patient,"yeah that was there was a link that was broken because they kept going back to the first page and and never continued loading i'm like I did it four times like okay Now I know it is the link. And I just requested hey you guys want me to fill this out, can you guys, please send me a functioning link. And then, after a while it says, I got an email saying, please fill out this link kind of like saying like you forgot this but I didn't I just you know it's like things like that i'm like oh. I guess they don't really know, but at least they found it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so. You did eventually work okay well you know there's a virtual clinic and is that, where you've been reaching out to try to resolve."
16232.0,Patient,know the right heart email.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. I think, maybe trying to virtual clinic might be a little bit more immediate. Because they have like people who are working there like managing all the appointments right now. Things like that. And you know because maybe the people that you're working with more directly like your care navigator may not. Maybe that person is a non right now, and so, if you try to reach them right now, then they don't answer you because they're not working right now, but maybe somebody else is filling in for them when we tried to reach out. So that I know it can be you know the technology is it does a lot of things so. You know, and sometimes it gets confusing for us to kind of figure out what where to go and how to do it, so I would advise try next time, instead of just using email go to the virtual clinic to see if you can. Get in a more immediate and direct answer, but now if there's any kind of problem that you're having I want you to to invite you just to let me know and I confess, as much messages. Along eighth and because you know in in because we you know we don't have a physical office we have this virtual office. And so now, you know where we're going to be meeting so if there's anything that's not going quite right, you know the whole point of treatment is to help you not to add further stress, so if if there's some kind of a bumpy road. Just let me know so that we can get the bumps work worked out so fair. yeah okay. All right. All right, so um let me see wanted to see. Did we do mindfulness exercises last time we practicing. mindfulness know."
16232.0,Patient,Think last time was all like.
760.0,Provider,It was all questions. yeah I asked you a bunch of questions. yeah okay.
16232.0,Patient,You know they needed to be so it's okay.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're struggling with Depression and anxiety, can you describe, for me, how would you rank those symptoms, since our last session with Depression and anxiety."
16232.0,Patient,Like one one through 10.
760.0,Provider,"yeah sure, however, you want to either probably be easiest."
16232.0,Patient,For today or for the week.
760.0,Provider,"um let's say in how do we see each other, was it a week or two weeks ago."
16232.0,Patient,"meals, a week ago."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's let's go for the."
16232.0,Patient,"Resale week. It was. kind of makes I you know after our session I kind of like like quite a lot still. And then eventually after an hour, so I finally stopped, and then the next day. So you were kind of."
760.0,Provider,It stopped because the emotion started to get express.
16232.0,Patient,"I was just being emotional yeah after two days, the rest of the days following that week. I was. I felt blessed I mean, I still felt sad but less anxious. Because I had also talk to my partner about it, like, I told him kind of how it went. I know he was. Really understanding. And suddenly he was like nicer."
760.0,Provider,No. Okay yeah okay.
16232.0,Patient,What it was I would say anxiety definitely less depression slightly less but yeah.
760.0,Provider,Okay slightly less okay good.
16232.0,Patient,Good good things that is lower for sure.
760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah, I think, yes, sometimes having information, sometimes, knowing that these painful feelings. You know, sometimes I think people have a tendency when they've suffered through things like i'm crazy and they kind of mix what happened to them, and maybe take on some of the blame for what had happened to them. Instead of understanding that you know this was something that happened to you that wasn't fair wasn't right, but in no way identifies you as in kind of a at fault or me or whatever negative adjectives sometimes people put on themselves."
16232.0,Patient,yeah like I used to feel kind of like ashamed for a while and then after that I was like you know it does happen to lot of people and it kind of made me feel less crazy so that I like.
760.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and then yeah good good i'm glad that was helpful so i'd like to start, I know we were going to do, seeking safety, but I would like to start with, where did my mindfulness sheet go. With some mindfulness because I want to teach you mindfulness because it's a quick easy coping skill. That you could start applying now because you know healing and recovery are a process and it's kind of like putting pieces to the puzzle you kind of have to you know. lay everything out and sort everything and and so, sometimes it takes a little while for the picture to start to come together. So recovery and healing is a lot like that, because you know you really don't know what the picture is going to look like yet. So mindfulness is something that I can at least get you started with. So that you would be able to use it between now and our next session and and honestly I would encourage you to start using it daily even even three times a day and you told me, you were and you're employed or you're unemployed. can't remember replied you're unemployed okay so. You don't that's okay that you don't have to have any kind of shame about that. says, you seem a little bit. uneasy about that answer your face anyway. So maybe one maybe one way to look for it, at least at this point in time is that you know my my feeling is my job, right now, and once I get to the next level in my feelings then i'm going to be more able to go out and find work should should that be what your goal is is that circle."
16232.0,Patient,mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay. So does that make sense yeah because, because when we're carrying a lot of shame and anxiety and depression it's really hard to function it's really hard to get up it's really hard to put you know, make the applications get out there, find work, so to get to get started. To get going. and start the process so mindfulness. Okay okay. Oh yeah did I trigger something is something that did I say something that triggered you again. talk to me amber."
16232.0,Patient,allison.
760.0,Provider,allison oh. My bad right.
16232.0,Patient,Okay. No it's just yeah when you brought up the employment thing that's all.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so what's what's your feeling on that what's going on with that."
16232.0,Patient,"One I do feel kind of bad that. Because a lot of the financial pressure falls on to my fiance. And he hasn't complained about it at all he's really nice about it, but you know I still feel kind of like guilty, because I know his job is extremely stressful."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16232.0,Patient,"And it's like i'm not really doing anything to help. it's, not because I don't want to i'm just. Not I think we discussed it already. were really able to."
760.0,Provider,"yeah. So it's not a lack of desire. it's just that your other mental health concerns are getting in way. Is that fair yes. And so, if we go back to our earlier conversation how listen. Go back to our earlier. If we go back to our earlier conversation. This is something that happened to you. it's not your fault. The only thing is, is that it's affecting you. And so you're in process right now in this moment. Through this time you're in process of working on that to make that better so it's important to give yourself the time in the space to do that. Because you know, sometimes people they want to rush out, they want to, they want to you know, there is a need for for finding work and they want to rush out and they. They take on too much and and so then maybe they start to miss appointments or the appointments become less easy to do, because I have to get to work and life is starting to interfere."
16232.0,Patient,And we're.
760.0,Provider,Here and we're and then. crying and then the anxiety and all the Russian yeah and it'll get you.
16232.0,Patient,People are like what's wrong with you and it's like.
760.0,Provider,yeah we.
16232.0,Patient,"should all be standing there like that you know, like. yeah just the fact that I don't even want to be seen so that's not good."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16232.0,Patient,"Okay, so."
760.0,Provider,"You know you you're just now you're just barely started this is our first or the last appointment, we did was an assessment appointment, it was just a kind of. getting to know you kind of appointment, so this is the first time, when i'm meeting. With just the agenda of. Working on things. yeah so. You know, so if you take on too much and you rush in and get a job it's it's. oftentimes the case that you set people set themselves backwards, when they do that so there's there's there's a process for everything, and as you walk along this path of healing and recovery. You will become ready to go seek work and to work. Does that make sense, but the main thing right now is to get you well to get your symptoms, managed to teach you coping skills so that you can manage because again you're not at fault for the things that happened to you. Okay. So. it's a blessing it's a blessing, that your fiance is is. So understanding so."
16232.0,Patient,yeah that's a good.
760.0,Provider,"thing that's a positive thing that he's he's being understanding about that. yeah and. OK OK okay so let's let's talk a little. bit about mindfulness. mindfulness is a state of non judgmental awareness of what's happening in the present moment, including the awareness of one's own thoughts feelings and senses. And when I say senses, I mean the things we see. Here, perhaps the things we touch maybe smell those kinds of senses Okay, because when people experienced trauma or when they struggle with anxiety, the mind often ruminates and struggles and it. And people have a tendency to worry about perceived mistakes from the past, or they worried about what's coming in the future they're not in the present moment. And we can't really make choice on what we're going to do in the past or the future you can't you know I can make a decision okay tomorrow morning i'm going to get up at. You know, six o'clock in the morning, I guess, we can try to make that decision, but I can't take an action on anything unless it's right now. Does that make sense, yes, so there's that. And so, some of the key components for mindfulness is awareness present moment awareness, I would say. So you're going to notice thoughts you're going to be noticing, what are the thoughts that i'm thinking, what are the things that i'm feeling what are physical sensations that are happening to me right now. The goal isn't to stop your mind from thinking about anxious things or anything but it's just to be aware of the thoughts and feelings, rather than getting lost in them. And you know worried about worrying about the past or the future so that makes sense. He sort of you're confused a little no."
16232.0,Patient,"it's not that it's just I. feel like when you're once you're aware of it, you have to experience it again aren't we try not to have that experience. I wouldn't that be like, not a good thing."
760.0,Provider,"um. We have a better process are you. Okay know what it's it's not about forcing yourself to have thoughts you're not thinking. But if the thoughts are there if if the trauma is set up some thought habits, you know you have things that you can visually think about you know, and if it's in your mind it's in your mind. it's not like i'm going to choose to think about my past trauma right now that's not what i'm saying it's about. it's just noticing what am I think. Because a lot of times, our thoughts are kind of unconscious we don't we don't or or maybe we're trying to repress them. It doesn't work to repress those feelings and thoughts when when they're traumatic because they don't really go anywhere, we just kind of shove them down hold them inside and it creates physical problems or and or mental health concerns or issues by holding that stuff. So does that makes sense and and. Which kind of leads me to the other key component which is acceptance. I don't have to like feeling. upset or angry or fearful. But the goal is to work towards acceptance and there's different strategies for doing that one one strategy is to say to myself this i'm i'm having a thought that scares me this is this is going to pass. Those kinds of things."
16232.0,Patient,"Okay, maybe. tell myself like it's going to be okay and it's okay to."
760.0,Provider,"exist, so this will pass and and you know it and and because we're talking about past trauma that's another thing you can say I seem to be thinking about my past experience, I had with being bullied. that's in the past and it's worrying and it's where you i'm feeling worried right now. And I seem to be living in that again those kinds of thoughts and and it's. The other thing I need to say about mindfulness is that it's a it's a practice it's not something that you're gonna i'm going to teach you in this this short session and you're going to be a superstar doing it. next hour it's a practice so you know it's kind of a new way of thinking, because I think when we when we experienced traumatic things, or when we have unpleasant emotions we try to shove them out of our. minds and we try to push it out of our mind and that doesn't work that doesn't work which is you know."
16232.0,Patient,Like facing your fears pretty much.
760.0,Provider,"it's walking through it, but, but the good news is those experiences are behind you in those moments you survived those moments, the best you could you were a kid in those moments, so you didn't maybe you didn't have the awareness, or the ability or the knowledge, how to handle. You handled it the best you could back then, you know so yeah but being present with this is what i'm feeling rather than trying to shove, it under a rug just because my brain says it's over it is. And it is over but there's still some part of my emotional self that still feels wounded that still feels like i'm there. And so, if we don't acknowledge that. Then we. We don't. You know, we can't heal from it. Because i'm too busy and and and honestly, it becomes bigger honestly because it becomes more scary because the more I run from it, it keeps. I can't get away from it and, and we know we can't get away from those things, so the war, we run the bigger it becomes, the more scary and we fight against it and keep going with that."
16232.0,Patient,And the more like I like find the more if i'm in it like and i'm aware of it basically it's still scary because eventually you become immune right because you. You process it.
760.0,Provider,out there's there's a healing and and you want to do it in a safe place. You wouldn't want to do these kinds of things when when you when your cousin is around you.
16232.0,Patient,You know let's say she.
760.0,Provider,comes over you.
16232.0,Patient,Okay well.
760.0,Provider,"As an example, just as an example, you know you, you want to make sure you're in a safe place or if you're around people that you don't think. are really truly even though you love them, even though they you know they love you you don't really feel emotionally supported by them you're going to pick and choose the places that trip, and I do this. So you're going to do that in a safe place like here in these sessions in groups, maybe when your journaling things like that. But we can go through our life trying to shove, our trauma under the rug because that does not work, you know you'll you know people can get all kinds of diseases or or maybe even. neck pain is sometimes people carry emotions in their neck, and maybe their lower back, maybe in the gut area and people get physically sick and then people get mentally sick as well. In having you know, issues such as. You know, like I know you're struggling with the anxiety, the depression. makes sense yeah so so it's it's a balanced state, you know, and you kind of have to gently talk yourself through it a little bit and just say I you know i'm thinking about I seem to be remembering this experience and i'm feeling. fearful i'm feeling anxious, you lose. You become aware of that. And so the acceptance part is really important, you know you don't have to guard against it because the good thing is that it's over now. Some of the benefits of mindfulness is reduced symptoms of Depression and anxiety. greater satisfaction and your relationships improve memory focus and mental processing speed reduced rumination. ability to adapt to stressful situations and approved ability to manage your emotions. Okay. Okay, so those are the benefits those are the benefits and so. There is, and I can I can email you this after our session. At some time before the end of the day, there's four different ways to practice mindfulness. One is mindfulness meditation some people are good at meditation some people kind of struggle with it have, maybe their mind wanders."
16232.0,Patient,that's me.
760.0,Provider,"that's you okay nothing wrong with that there's other choices and and maybe that's one of the hardest ones, to start with, maybe that's one that you kind of work up to. In your practice of mindfulness there's also a body scan which involves paying close attention to. sensations in your body, starting with all the different body parts, starting with your feet and moving up your legs, you know your stomach your back. your shoulders, all the way about up and. Then there's a mindfulness walk. While while walking you make a point you try to be in the moment if you're walking people walk and work unconscious we we don't think about are walking we just walk you know. We haven't thought about are lacking, since we were learning to walk. So go on a walk and and you know if you're feeling particularly anxious that's you know your brain can really only foot focus on one maybe two things at a time. So if i'm going to go on a mindfulness walk in my neighborhood then i'm going to be paying attention to the way the my feet feel in my shoes my i'm going to feel hot my arms the way they move my legs, the way they need going to pay attention to the temperature. The the the sun if it sounds the what I see you know going to notice the trees, maybe dogs over there, running whatever it is, you see, and and you're going to choose your focus on what's happening right now around me which gives you less. Mind capacity to be ruminating about anxiety and depression okay that makes sense. Yes, but it also mindfulness walk does another thing too if you're anxious, you have those fighter flight hormone surging through your brain so when we when we move through that. and go walk or exercise in some way or any kind of physical a physical activity we're allowing the body to do what it naturally wants to do, which is to move fight or flight. Right, so you know so you're occupying your mind and you're occupying your body same kinds of mindfulness walk. And then the last one is probably the simplest, one which is the five senses is five things you see four things you here are the four things you feel and I don't mean emotions, I mean physical senses like you know I feel the paper fill a paper on my desk."
16232.0,Patient,And I feel I feel my sweater.
760.0,Provider,"I feel the. Final chair. yeah. And then, and then three things you hear one thing you taste one thing smell, and this is not something that's going to take your anxiety from an eight to zero, but it might take it from a six foot four."
16232.0,Patient,yeah it'll help.
760.0,Provider,"And so it's as in my analogy with the puzzle it's part of a set of skills to do and and recovery involves making conscious choices to. deal with things in different ways. Rather than the destructive ways, or just the avoidant pattern or the isolation pattern."
16232.0,Patient,think like to like when you think about the bad bad things that have happened in someone's life like mindfulness I was just thinking like I don't notice a lot of these things I don't hear I don't see I don't smell. Because you're not there you're in here. And i'm sure that's another.
760.0,Provider,reason.
16232.0,Patient,But I think it'll help a lot yeah it'll help. us to be present.
760.0,Provider,"The past yes. Because in that moment I didn't feel safe and because are we're kind of human beings we're kind of wired for self preservation and you know this, you know we've been wired throughout all time as far as I know, for self preservation. But the mind doesn't really distinguish between things like physical safety and emotional safety that the fear and the and the hormone you know the the stress hormones are going through the brain are kind of the same. And, and so we're we feel the need to be on guard and so we're constantly worried about what happened oh my gosh it's coming kind of goes back and forth. And that's that's the way we are so. mindfulness is. Is that. And you know we're it's really super easy to make a decision okay i'm going to practice mindfulness to the day and. you're going to find that you'll get busy doing whatever chores or activities that you need to do for the day and your mind will forget because that's just the way we are. And as soon as you remember, we don't judge we don't say up you know beat myself up I got I just hope i'm going to pick up i'm going to do i'm going to going to do it right now, and do it every time I remember and that's the practicing part. Okay, so it makes sense. yeah okay so would you like to have. This sheet it's this the sheet that I was just reading from. Oh yeah that was great. If these green squares, I know that you can barely see are these are the different mindfulness exercise, you could start with the with the. You don't have health problems right you don't have any physical reason can't walk."
16232.0,Patient,I could walk.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so start with those two. And, and maybe try to do try to do it. I mean the five senses one takes off takes less than five minutes."
16232.0,Patient,So.
760.0,Provider,"You know if you notice your anxiety start to build use it. So try it but, but you don't have to wait for your pain level to get high and. You can wait until you can just it's practice because a lot of times what happens when we get all anxious and upset all the things that we know we're supposed to do we just forget.
