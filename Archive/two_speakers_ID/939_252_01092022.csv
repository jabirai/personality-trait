ID,Role,Message
252.0,Provider,Can you hear me.
939.0,Patient,"Yes. Okay, there we go."
252.0,Provider,Mr yeah you look good.
939.0,Patient,"pretty good. You know, it was just really awkward today cuz. My grandson who's been having problems. stayed with my husband. This weekend and so called today, quite a few times my grandson and he kept wanting me to talk to Larry and I kept telling him no I don't want to talk to him i'm. You know, and he wanted me to come over I said there's no way i'm coming over there, but, and then I ended up saying Okay, you know so luckily it wasn't bad it just it's very awkward. For me, and because he text me all day all night I mean it's constant and it's always. Tell him me like stuck his counselor tells him, and then you can tell he's been drinking, because then they'll start getting angry and saying all kinds of stuff, and so I just don't answer much at all. And you know, he said something about it, and I said, you know I hear what you're saying I said direct you know it helps me some of the things you say I said I just don't have the time and I just can't answer you all the time, you know but. He seems to be a lot better about everything, but I don't want to take the chance. yeah because Danny."
252.0,Provider,he's still drinking.
939.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah. You know yep and I just that's one of the reasons I can't go there is because the all that alcohol oh my God. it's really, really hard in fact I like I told you, I had to leave that one day. Because I just knew I couldn't be around it."
252.0,Provider,"So, and this is your grandson that bullies you."
939.0,Patient,little bit yeah. He just presses and presses to get me to do what he wants and then I do and it's almost like my relationship with him is kinda like with Michael. I don't want him to turn out like Michael and that's what's going to happen if I don't get a backbone.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
939.0,Patient,"You know and it's like Why am I afraid to stand my ground I don't get it, I Why do I do with Michael I do it with case and I did it with Larry instead of just saying no. You know it's like I can't say no. And, and then I just I don't know I don't know why I backed off, and you know i'll say no, but then eventually they can get me to turn around most the time you know to do whatever they want."
252.0,Provider,And they know that. and That you know. They know that. What do you think would happen if one time. You just stuck to your know.
939.0,Patient,"me. i'm sure nothing bad would happen, you know. What am I afraid. that's what I always ask myself why am I afraid."
252.0,Provider,"I think it's it's you know these are the people that you love. And when codependency it's hard to say no, you don't want. them to be mad at you, you don't want them to turn away from you early view right. So it's easier to give in than it is to accept the fact that they're upset with you because you won't do what they want you to do. What I know is that if you don't start now with your grandson. It is going to get worse. And if you don't start with Michael it's just going to get worse. Right, no. No, this is about, you know empowering your voice empowering you and being codependent it doesn't feel good. i'm not gonna lie to you, it does not feel good when you have to say no. But you can look at the scenario. And way out the odds."
939.0,Patient,"that's what i'm going to do. and Like Danielle came in her last night because he was crying on the phone to me, which used to work about money and how he's getting sick and. He couldn't take it, and I want to go to rehab now, and I can all this stuff and so she came in the House, I said to have Danielle come in here. And I told her I said, I have a feeling that he thinks when I tell them know that I have all this money that I could give him and i'm just saying no. Right hmm. So anyway, I showed her I said here's my checking and here's my savings here's what let his left to borrow off the the personal loan that I took out for them and. So she did she was like yeah he thought you had money that you were just saying you didn't have so she told me, she said, I told him last night and he said all bullshit and she says no, I saw it she's she's not lying you know. And I told her make sure you let them know and i'll let him know, I cannot help him anymore I just don't have it he's squeeze me dry and I hate myself for it. You know."
252.0,Provider,When I think of.
939.0,Patient,"All the times i've had money, I could have bought a sewing machine I could have got stuff I wanted and I never did I have nothing to show for anything. Except my flowers. Buying and I need to quit buying but. You know it's just maddening it really upsets me, you know."
252.0,Provider,"What don't hate yourself, for it."
939.0,Patient,"yeah. i'm just fantastic you know. classic well that's true, too, when you think about that. You know this all be destroyed in the end, will you know. You can you can take with us to heaven so."
252.0,Provider,"No, but."
939.0,Patient,No.
252.0,Provider,"I think, setting boundaries, you know is definitely. it's one of the toughest things to do, because not only do you have to set boundaries with them, but you have to set boundaries with you."
939.0,Patient,hmm mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,"You know what I mean. yeah it's not just about telling them no but it's also about getting you to under getting you, to the point and understanding that. You have to say no."
939.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"If you have money in your bank that's your money that's not their money, he said, adult. Right."
939.0,Patient,"And he always says when I get paid i'm going to pay you back, no, you will know. Because you'll go through it before he can even give it to me. I just. I know i'm going to be able to be better about that, with him, I think you know I think the hard part on right now I worry about my grandson so much. What doesn't help is you know he's had a really rough at home his dad my son is super Nice and kind and. can be swayed sometimes he starting to get you know the good know in front of him, but his wife who's been with them for gosh six years or so, you know I I think I told you about how she treated and so he hates it at home. But. He is now on the brink of getting suspended from school totally completely. Because he keeps getting suspended expelled I guess is what it is, you know I mean the latest thing was they were playing basketball, and he missed a shot and these girls made fun of them one of them was in a wheelchair and, of course, he says well at least I can walk. yeah."
252.0,Provider,yeah suspended for that.
939.0,Patient,yep.
252.0,Provider,that's a little much.
939.0,Patient,"yeah that's yeah it's what it is, though, I think they've just had it with them, you know. He doesn't teaching moment and that. yeah. Just the fact that she was in a wheelchair, and he said that."
252.0,Provider,messing with him.
939.0,Patient,"yeah that's the thing. And I think because he's caused so much trouble they just don't believe anything he says, I don't know. But yeah it seemed to my mom. Worries so much about them and you it's like when he's here you can't hardly discipline them because she has his back you know because he hasn't so rapid home she doesn't want him to have it rough any other way."
252.0,Provider,"refresh my memory, why is it that he has a rough at home."
939.0,Patient,"The. My friend's wife. he's she's always be a little TIM compared them to her daughter would enforce discipline my son, would you know he didn't backup case and ever he just. Let her well now he's trying to backup in case the little too late, sometimes, but she screams a lot to everything's yelling and screaming even with her daughter. You know it's just and she says oh it's because i'm Italian I said no that's not an excuse you can't you know because she said what she says, you know I will not allow you to come between my your father in me. And I thought that that was kind of a nice thing to say, to a nine year old you know. And she'd make him take the door off the hinges and do all this extra stuff but wasn't just one thing, it was take the xbox the telephone everything away, you know. And for long times long periods. And she, of course, was hoping, they could put him in a home for wayward boys, but the counselor said no it's not time for something like that, yet you know."
252.0,Provider,him.
939.0,Patient,"yeah she helped create this. And you know. it's. it's hard you know, none of the family likes or. Nobody wanted them to get married you know, but because he was my son I stayed on his side and tried to make the family acceptor. And you know tried to include her in a holidays when nobody really wanted her here. You know just to try and make things better. Right, you know, but it I don't know it seemed like they were getting along better, but I think he's just had it at home, you know. He didn't he just can't stand it there, well, I think he has extra freedom over here, which you know we probably shouldn't give any extra freedom here. But you know I mean we're good to him, but my mom I mean he talks her out of giving him money, and I mean too much too much she does. You know she she got him a $200 skateboard and and the $40 gift certificate to target and gave him money, and then the other grandchildren she swapped it given them more than 20 bucks. You know it's the favoritism is awful. yeah you know, and then, when I told her, she should give him, she said well that's enough don't you think, and I said no, and then she got mad I suppose don't ask me I said, but no that's not enough, I said at least another 20. yeah make it 40. You there oh God it just kills me she was like that with my son, he was her favorite and she you can tell, and I always hated that I don't like the favoritism."
252.0,Provider,And are neither.
939.0,Patient,You know gosh. The kids know my kids think they're the favorite that's funny on my part.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
939.0,Patient,They all think they're the.
252.0,Provider,"Now, are the favorite. Right yeah. that's funny. that's really funny."
939.0,Patient,"I just. pray I just wish I knew what to do for caisson I don't know what I can do to help him. You know. Well, he told me he says, I I said why this this and he just says, I don't care I just don't care. You know they'll say things to the teacher disrespectful I don't care. I don't know how to turn that one around you don't care about anything you."
252.0,Provider,"Well, a lot of it probably has to do with him. living in a home that he doesn't feel like he's really care for. that's true should he care. Nobody, you know what I mean no one at home cares."
939.0,Patient,Oh yeah right. That makes sense.
252.0,Provider,Getting him to understand that what he does today doesn't affect anybody else but him later. And really taking on.
939.0,Patient,I gotta write that down oh my gosh right.
252.0,Provider,You know.
939.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"it's like this isn't about you know the House, he lives in this isn't about being accepted by anybody this isn't about. You know, having the wicked step mom and the passive dad, this is about him taking charge of him. And what do you want to be when you get older, you know. You got to start now changing those I don't care attitudes because somebody has to care. You have here, you know, this is about us isn't about anybody else you're not hurting anybody else with this bad behavior but you."
939.0,Patient,Well yeah.
252.0,Provider,you're better than that you know. You just.
939.0,Patient,build them up like that too.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, very much so. Very much so always give him compliments, you know when this is one thing that a lot of parents don't realize, but when you give a kid a negative, you have to give them two positives."
939.0,Patient,"Ah, OK."
252.0,Provider,"You give them all negative that's how they develop low self esteem low worth I don't care attitudes, you know. Good always has always overran bad."
939.0,Patient,Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,When our kids only hear what they're doing wrong and never what they're doing right.
939.0,Patient,hmm yeah.
252.0,Provider,They build that shield of. I don't care. You know. And that we could step nominees we put in her place. You know.
939.0,Patient,That one day. didn't last long.
252.0,Provider,"it's like what kind of kid are you trying to develop here and angry cut you know cut off kid that doesn't care about what anybody else does or things, or do you want to create a a well developed respectful hard working honest person. yeah way you're doing it obviously that's not what you're getting it's not working."
939.0,Patient,yeah exactly. wow that's good. should have them talk to you. tell you.
252.0,Provider,"In taking away, you know. One thing that I was taught recently. Taking away the kids is electronics and phones and everything. No matter how long you take it away from the effects still going to be the same So if you took it away from them for 15 or 20 minutes or you took it away from them for a day and got or a week and got him in a routine of doing tours and being respectful and let them earn it back."
939.0,Patient,huh.
252.0,Provider,"You let them earn it back. Okay, shows the kid I can do good too."
939.0,Patient,Sorry i'm writing this down. This is good. well.
252.0,Provider,"And you as as Nana is grandma got to set boundaries with them and say I love you I love you so much, but no means no. When I say no, I shouldn't have to tell you more than twice."
939.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"So don't push me because no will me know and I love you i'm willing to work with you i'm willing to compromise and come in the middle, with you. But please, please, when I say no let up you know. he's old enough that you can like and then, when he goes back to the old behaviors and be like at Member remember talk."
939.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,"No, no."
939.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know. kids are a lot easier with adults, they really are in that it takes a while to get them retrained. But it's just consistent."
939.0,Patient,"yeah. You know, constantly doing the same thing here."
252.0,Provider,"Only that then we have a talk remember. yeah no love you. They feel you know, then they get their built up they're not continually tore down, you know."
939.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Now, as far as like you said when there's a negative you're talking to like when they've done something wrong and you're. Part of. How I put it."
252.0,Provider,You talk about his stepmom belittle belittling him.
939.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So she's calling them names or telling him he's worthless he's no good as a you know. it's all in the way that she presented to them if she's telling him this behavior is is not good, I like it better, when you act in these good behaviors that when you act like that, and you are in that good of a mood. you're awesome. i'm down in this way. This is."
939.0,Patient,Change right. yeah there we go.
252.0,Provider,"But it's about how the information is presented, if he's been told that he's bad and that he's stupid and that he you know can't do anything right if those are the things that he's been told, no wonder why he doesn't care."
939.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
252.0,Provider,"doesn't matter, what I do it's not going to change your opinion of me."
939.0,Patient,huh you're right.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean.
939.0,Patient,yeah. they're just running them.
252.0,Provider,"And then, comparing him to somebody else."
939.0,Patient,"Oh, I know I hate."
252.0,Provider,"You know what you tell him. This is what I would tell him listen. I you know I hate when you're when you're step mom compares you to your step sister, but can I tell you a secret. No two people are alike in any way. At all you are uniquely special in your development and your build. there's nobody that has jeans like you. You are uniquely you. So when she says that stuff."
939.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Because that's the god's honest truth, you know that right."
939.0,Patient,there's yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You may build up on that part, so that he can build a little bit of a Defense off of. That type of negativity that he's hearing you know."
939.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
252.0,Provider,So that's how you can help him. Okay hold them up build.
939.0,Patient,i'm going to do that'll be good.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
939.0,Patient,yeah that's so good stuff.
252.0,Provider,"that's kind of. Their times you don't get me wrong, I don't do things perfectly with my grandkids either there are times when you know i'm like just go do it because I told you to do it."
939.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,or other times you know where I always say to my six year old granddaughter listen I don't want to fight with you today. i'm gonna need you to do this. So please just go do it for Nana K don't get mad don't throw a fit please just go get it done go pick up your toys. And then she'll go.
939.0,Patient,Through.
252.0,Provider,"Just how you. Really, how you talk to how you talk to them. And the boundaries, you know kids think that they don't want boundaries are need them, they need them. You know, structure and boundaries. Because they're being taught. How to live with through those."
939.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,Right.
939.0,Patient,"i've always thought that the kids really do need them. They liked them i've heard so many times that children like boundaries, you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah and they'll definitely push that so you got some real you know reprogramming to do with the little guy but it's not impossible.
939.0,Patient,He just turned 13.
252.0,Provider,Now he's still where you can you know uplift them and turn them around little bit.
939.0,Patient,But he's six feet tall. And 210 pounds.
252.0,Provider,holy cow.
939.0,Patient,he's a big boy.
252.0,Provider,he's a big boy.
939.0,Patient,My other grandson is six five.
252.0,Provider,holy cow. You got tall boys.
939.0,Patient,And Larry will use only six to that's not super tall but larry's mom though she was almost six foot herself.
252.0,Provider,Really tall.
939.0,Patient,yeah and then Jennifer it's husband was is really tall 264. But. yeah I think he'll outgrow his dad for sure.
252.0,Provider,that's funny.
939.0,Patient,yeah it's crazy on. They just don't look like their ages.
252.0,Provider,that's probably something that he needs to really understand to. You know us he's a lot bigger than. You know most kids his age he's probably a little bit more intimidating just by his size.
939.0,Patient,True yeah. No us.
252.0,Provider,"And so you know, making him aware of that part two."
939.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know it's not just about things we say to people words but because you are already you know this tall your your you know actually the size of a 16 year old and so. yeah you know.
939.0,Patient,it's trying to. treat them a little differently to they don't treat them like he's. 13 year old. Know premium like us. And then.
252.0,Provider,wonder why they get what they get.
939.0,Patient,yeah exactly. So really you've really helped me a lot.
252.0,Provider,"it's about it's just about boundaries, you know and with Michael it's about setting boundaries, even the tough ones. crying and private, because you will not picking up a bottle, no matter what. Because that never solves anything. No, but knowing that. These boundaries which i'm glad and I heard you set one of financial, even though the money is not there."
939.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,"Act is that you still said no, and stuff."
939.0,Patient,yeah yeah. Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,Even if you have money that's not his business. I know you can no longer. support them living in the car outside your House.
939.0,Patient,"yeah that's what cracks me up is like none of his business what I have, or what I do with my money."
252.0,Provider,"But you've given him that power for so long, he."
939.0,Patient,got that's right.
252.0,Provider,You got to take that power back.
939.0,Patient,yeah that's for sure. never thought about it in fact I gave them power over me like. That financially help.
252.0,Provider,minima know it. See that's a big piece of codependency that we don't know we will we will go without we will.
939.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,"But everything on the line, as long as they have what they need right and we can help our adult children right. But only if we have the means to do it, not to support their drug habit. Right, but to support them moving forward in their life. yeah now it's just about he needs either treatment or he's gonna. go to jail. yeah that's inevitable. yeah inhabitable. yeah option it's an option, right now, but when he goes to jail that option will be gone to."
939.0,Patient,"He just the problem is you can't get in for like a couple months, but like you said. I told him if you call every day, every day. My guys, you told me for his name would be in the years and so that's what I need him to do no."
252.0,Provider,"No, no, no that's what he needs to do for him."
939.0,Patient,that's true.
252.0,Provider,"We even have language that right. yeah have language that it's about us this he needs to do for him, he needs to stand up and take control of his adult life and do this for him."
939.0,Patient,yeah so irritating now i've been.
252.0,Provider,"Well, so don't beat yourself up you're talking to the biggest probably codependent there's in this world. We know. I get it, but I also understand and know I had to learn the hard way. i'm a boundaries and about PR protecting us and allowing them to go through their process. Right. Yes, their process it's not ours. That sucks that we have to sit back and watch it."
939.0,Patient,"Oh, and."
252.0,Provider,In the same sense How else are they going to get on the other side. And then allows you time to work on your own recovery and get more time under your belt right. yeah that coping skill of going to the bottle.
939.0,Patient,we're.
252.0,Provider,i'm going to pull some things out of. My codependency but for you. Next time we meet we'll go over them.
939.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good."
252.0,Provider,"And we'll just start doing some work in this area. Because. you've got to learn the behaviors that cause you to be in the scenario that you're in you. said, you know the wording like what we just talked about you've got to be able to set boundaries for the little things but also the big things."
939.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"No one's going to take care of you, but you."
939.0,Patient,gotta remember that. You know yeah. True right.
252.0,Provider,"So this isn't about beating ourselves up, this is about learning. healthier way to live."
939.0,Patient,"True. Okay, to think of it like that."
252.0,Provider,"yeah totally when I first got told that I was codependent. So sick or the oh my God and. Then, when I. really started reading about it and understanding it. No, no. We are natural born caretakers."
939.0,Patient,Right yeah that's true.
252.0,Provider,"We are taught when we're younger. That we take care of our children, no if ands or buts there they come first, you know our needs have to come second, and if that way, especially in a family unit that is poor, if you don't have enough food you don't need the kids right. yeah everybody else comes before you. But in reality, what happens is that creates. problems for later on in life. hmm so in those scenarios, yes, the kids would definitely come first, but when they're older and they're able to be self sufficient. They need to stand up and take control over their own life you no longer are responsible for you know whether or not they're eating, whether or not they're there you know sleeping What are they doing to help themselves."
939.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"Well, they don't have to help themselves. Because we do it all for them."
939.0,Patient,Oh yeah that's true.
252.0,Provider,"And so, not doing things for them teaches them how to stand on their own two feet."
939.0,Patient,"And then I think well i've always done this for him, so how is he ever going to learn it, so I just continue doing it like."
252.0,Provider,What is.
939.0,Patient,A doctor's appointment.
252.0,Provider,Then you walk in.
939.0,Patient,One for me okay. Oh.
252.0,Provider,"yeah you say no i'm not going to make it for you, but i'll certainly sit with you, the first time and walk you through how to do it, so that you can take care of that from now on."
939.0,Patient,that's what i'll do that.
252.0,Provider,"You know what I mean, and that is slowly but surely, giving him control over all the things that you have managed for him. allowing him to take control of his life. Because he needs to it's time."
939.0,Patient,just too bad that I didn't. Add things.
252.0,Provider,"No, no, we don't do that we have done the best that we have done. Based off of what we know to do. And that's what you have to remember now you're learning different ways to work with it now, you can start doing things a little bit differently that's more healthy for you and him."
939.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
252.0,Provider,So it's all in the way you perceive it. You can take it and use it as a. As a BAT and beat yourself up with it that's not going to get you anywhere. Or you can take it and empower yourself and say. i'm going to learn a different way to think and a different way to deal with my children with boundaries. I need to for me and my own recovery.
939.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,We for them and there's.
939.0,Patient,yeah exactly that's true.
252.0,Provider,that's what this is about progression. Not being so stressed out that. The coping skill that you know how to use.
939.0,Patient,You do.
252.0,Provider,Right.
939.0,Patient,"This is a no i'm happy to learn these things so that I can feel better. I can imagine you know I would probably be so much more relaxed if I just was able to do all these things, and you know make people do their own stuff and. I can just see how all feel better. yeah yeah. He will me."
252.0,Provider,you'll see. i'll show you.
939.0,Patient,Thank you so much. see each other again.
252.0,Provider,let's do it i'm a Sunday too long.
