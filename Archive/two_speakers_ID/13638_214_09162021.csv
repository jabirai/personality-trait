13638.0,Patient,hey.
214.0,Provider,"hey how you doing. Good Okay, so let me, let me just find out what is it do you think is not happening or what may I not be helping you with cuz. I don't care about the emails I love the communication, but what do you, is there a disconnect Am I. Like I want to make sure you feel you're being taken care of and that we validate and we hear what you're saying so, like you want to go over some things like you know i'm not sure why this is happening or why is this being done this way."
13638.0,Patient,"um I guess like I just can't get confused on. Like. Like the medication on. Why, I don't know like why it went from like four days or. So I guess I just kind of get confused."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so let me take a look and see if I can provide. Some factual information. Why. Okay, so let's."
13638.0,Patient,forgot to do one survey i'm not sure if I keep going I go back to the same email and then i'm not sure which one I hit.
214.0,Provider,So he gave you a week's prescription on the 19th.
13638.0,Patient,yeah less time.
214.0,Provider,"Did till was it the prior time that was an issue okay so probably what it looks like is I don't know why that's even on, but let me let's look at it."
13638.0,Patient,"I think gary's because you said I, Mr."
214.0,Provider,"Now, so what they did was and and I think he caught it going forward so your appointment actually that you showed up for and it got canceled because insurance. Is is is tagged as cancel but the system says there's a problem with that it doesn't know why it gets cancelled. And then we missed one cancels individual patient reports, just to pick up a daughter, and there was one in August. So let's just think about the August 19 and we're, not even in September 19 so the system is saying this is the same timeframe, so when Dr Malik last week, wrote the prescriptions there was probably a red flag. But there's no red flag on your system now, so you should never unless we go back to some missed appointments but going forward, you should always the minimum should be a week."
13638.0,Patient,"Okay, when I clawed for the. Insurance thing they said that they had to insurance and they're. Not they had care source and another one. And that's right it's doing."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, were you able to get that corrected, though with the virtual clinic."
13638.0,Patient,I think so she said that she will put that in there.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, because you wouldn't have been able to get on today, otherwise so that must have been."
13638.0,Patient,Man so confused cuz I was like whoa. I was able to get on any other time.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I these things happen like anomalies and no one has a great explanation I think that's the frustrating part like if we could have a clear answer would like oh. But like, why is there to now that wasn't Why would, I have to who and all of a sudden now it's gone, but it seems to have all cleared up."
13638.0,Patient,yeah like I didn't do something with them family services or something.
214.0,Provider,"No, no, no, I mean i'm looking at your surveys your surveys done, the only thing that's backlog now and it's not really backlog right but I pathetically it is is you did a August urine but you haven't done a September urine."
13638.0,Patient,"Okay. I did, one I don't know."
214.0,Provider,"You do one August. August 29. Right right so here it is. Right, everything is negative, except for the medication that you're receiving which is wonderful so. The question is. Why isn't another one on its way because that's what. Did he sent you all for labs or no."
13638.0,Patient,"No, I had that. We had talked about it, and then you said, like if I did it by. Sunday. or Saturday, one of them, and I did it, and that was. Only one."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so let me just see if there's anything about the check for future performance that's fine vc scheduling that's fine. I to the only thing i'm going to do here is. i'm i'm gonna make a note so we're covered. Okay, about the drug screen. We see this way if there's anything that's going to make the prescription of problem I already addressed it and Dr Malik can verify that we were already ahead of the curve not trying to do it today, the prescription, so this is good. I received a. truck screen, please and. This. A truck. For. Summer one. Be. What perfect awesome I just got figure out who's in charge of caseload."
13638.0,Patient,If I could get labs because my daughter.

13638.0,Patient,Why yeah like Why would I go sleep one night and my feet are finding that wake up the next day and that's you.
214.0,Provider,"know. Alright, so you submitted both survey, I mean the survey for pH Q nine is depression gad is anxiety in on the depression plot the squad tells us the zero depression, do you think that's a good reflection. yeah Okay, and on the anxiety part the gad part, do you think it says zero score do you think that's a good reflection of what's going on with you. yeah let's uh how are you think you're managing yourself how do you think your moods have been."
13638.0,Patient,"i'm good. My daughter's birthday is coming up, and she wants a puppy. So he's been dog sitting. And I think it's kind of a good just for both of us, it makes you know it's I don't know I don't know how to explain it, but like. dogs your best friend, you know."
214.0,Provider,"Oh, I just I I. i'm right there with you, I have. And I call on my daughter she's my everything so she makes me more responsible. it's unconditional you know, like. Right, though we don't verbally communicate this a lot of affection there's a lot of stimulation it's just a good feeling so yeah I think that that's a wonderful thing okay."
13638.0,Patient,make you happy right no they don't.
214.0,Provider,"They just when you think you know the world's caving in and they come over or whatever, whatever the entertainment on the new job they provide us feeling valued and validated, so I think that's. A good thing Okay, what do you think how do you think the medications gone, by the way. Any withdrawals. how's your sleep."
13638.0,Patient,"i'm like the medication it's good with my feet, they hurt."
214.0,Provider,Do you think there's any correlation between the medication and your feet.
13638.0,Patient,wow I don't know if it's just. Allow walking all the time.
214.0,Provider,"Do you do you have any pre existing conditions, diabetes, high blood pressure."
13638.0,Patient,"No, I have. irregular heart rate right."
214.0,Provider,"I mean that could be the cause of it right, because if you're if you're not circulating correctly, you wind up getting a DEMO or you get the swallowing. And it doesn't mean it's an emergency, but like if this is the first time it's happened, you need to like mock it on the calendar happens again, you probably should see a general practitioner, to make sure like what's going on. As eating habits. A mood overall how's your mood overall."
13638.0,Patient,Again it's. is better than. my daughter. has been home. So you know. Like when she used to come home from school I used to support sometimes you just come in. And like. Waiting for I get up. But now we're kind of on a better. plan.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good and and do you feel some changes positive changes during this period of time for yourself. Has anyone else noticed positive changes in you."
13638.0,Patient,"um. My mom like I talked to her phone, but I can't really be around her so."
214.0,Provider,"I get that I get them. So what what, what do you think your outlook is for the winter like you have any ideas any plans any goals."
13638.0,Patient,"I want to. I want to get a job, but I don't want to. Like mess up my metro and stuff so I want to get like a part time job. Because. With like my last show. um. yeah I couldn't make it on my own. Like not with a job without labels, I could make it. Like a part time job. No, I wouldn't make enough to. Like to lose it right."
214.0,Provider,"Well that's a good plan I think that's a very good plan and and have you thought about like what part time jobs, you want to do what you're interested in doing."
13638.0,Patient,"i'm the only jobs i've ever had were like a gas station job which i'm really good at, but. I don't know, I would like to try something else it's just you know I get nervous because i've never had experience in something."
214.0,Provider,"And, have you ever thought about going like on the Department of Labor. Jobs edge of further education, because that's all free. To see what classes are available, like for certificates. That you may be like hey that'd be a cool certificate to have because it's free."
13638.0,Patient,"Right, I wanted to do the medical billing coding. thing is is like. I don't have I didn't have a felony before, but I did my job. Whatever it's."
214.0,Provider,Okay.
13638.0,Patient,"I dread click that's what it is, and so it took it off my record, but I don't know where could still see it because."
214.0,Provider,"So upon completion i'm assuming I don't know if they use the word expunged, but if you completed, then that would be taken away right. It won't appear anywhere. it's a sealed file. I mean if you go work for law enforcement and you need certain levels of security they're going to be able to see that, but the average employer won't see that, because you had a requirement if you met the requirements, then they said Okay, then this goes away. You don't have to follow that you're a felon. there's nothing there."
13638.0,Patient,"Wait and that's when I had to do with my metro because she looked it up and it had a case on there, so they denied me well, I came back on an appeal and I was like no. This is what happened and I still have my papers stating, you know that it was dismissed so that was my I got my metro, but when she first looked at."
214.0,Provider,"It because she because she can see. Which, so this is how they look at it's like when you forget you get a misdemeanor as a kid. You like you do and then all of a sudden or. A disorderly conduct, which is not a misdemeanor or felony people forget those things may apply for jobs. And they come up they don't know they've been resolved paid expunge they just know, there was a case. Sometimes, when you say nothing is pending in they see that that they're figuring you're lying about something that's how they look at it. But I would say to you that, even if someone were to say hey tesla like you know we can't give you a job because this, you could say wait a minute it doesn't exist, you may have found the case, but I don't have any charges, and that would be a true statement. So they X, if you are Have you ever been convicted. The answer is you haven't been. Because it's a way I know there's some additional steps, just in case they go through it, but you are fine it's a little bit of pain, the ass but at least you have documentation that says that that's been dismissed. So you know court cases one thing and then the dismissal is definitely a plus, so I would definitely always keep on to that paperwork. it's something you're going to have to go through, but over time, you know, once you get 1015 years out. That thing gets really buried unless you're going for you know jobs that deal with security and things like that finances, they may dig a little deeper, but you still have a resolution to it so don't let that deter you."
13638.0,Patient,I wanted to do SDN as because they would pay for your classes and.
214.0,Provider,"What is that, by the way."
13638.0,Patient,"it's a State tested nurse or well like them like networking in nursing homes. So I wanted to do that, but. You gotta get over. over everything we're going through right now."
214.0,Provider,"I get it right well, listen to the idea is not to make you feel like you need to do something, the idea is to stimulate the conversation. Because we don't think about things, then. We don't think about them and they kind of go by the wayside, so at least a discussion keeps you present. And maybe after the phone call you'd be like maybe I can. Let me go research some that's all that about it's not about like you need to this is an immediate you've got to take a slow pace, but you still have to think about what's next year, going to be because next year is really around the corner. it's October November, December so. You know less than 100 days we're going to be in the next year, so it's just something good for you to look at you know, especially as you're you're doing so well with the Program. Like I would suggest that you know you continue to do that right so everything looks good I took care of. them being notified that you still haven't received the tumblers should I shouldn't be a problem i'll make sure and Dr mallika he's copied on that to host see that okay Monday i'm not gonna let that impact how I do my prescriptions and when's our next appointment."
13638.0,Patient,The 30th. It is the.
214.0,Provider,"30th yep what time is it 11 3011 1111 same time but this one was later, but that one's at 11am OK. OK alright awesome keep up the great work and i'll See you in group on Monday."
13638.0,Patient,I think ya.
214.0,Provider,bye bye.
