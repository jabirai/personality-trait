191.0,Provider,"yeah and you made a every other month yeah and my concern let's revisit this because we have to really think about your safety and think about definitely stepping up the support to make certain that we watch for the alcohol you so. buprenorphine, which is the active ingredients and suboxone is a very safe medicine, even at higher doses, but you can increase your risk of overdose and then that happens. More more likely with the alcohol or the sedative type metal incentive xanax klonopin value muscles relax or sleeping pills, and so we really want to make certain that you're not mixing it, so I want to just encourage you to stop the alcohol intake. Okay now wait, let me ask you this, when you can you go without alcohol."

191.0,Provider,"When you when you are without alcohol, do you have any seizures. Now he shakes. know any tremors."

To not do xanax or any said it is what the medicines not do any other opioids summer revisit your history, I have here that there is a history of crystal meth use in the past. So crystal meth ahead here that you use daily for four years viewer snorting was the last time you use crystal meth."
5896.0,Patient,"i'm. One of them, been fall of 2019."
191.0,Provider,fall 2019 okay all right.
5896.0,Patient,Our spring spring I think when I went to my ex boyfriend got arrested I don't know why.
191.0,Provider,"spring spring of 2019. yeah okay so since the crystal meth remains in remission I did a DSM five on you back then, when I asked you those 11 questions and based on the DSM five you had severe stimulant use disorder and then based on DSM five with the benzodiazepine use xanax. We you had a moderate sedative use disorder and that's in remission so stimulant use disorder severe remission and that's based on the prior DSM five and then. Saturday if use disorder. Okay use. disorder and that was in acts and based on a DSM five that was. Moderate i'm looking here i've got all my notes here you're still here. moderate and then I know we have the opioid use disorder and. opioid use disorder and that was back here severe and that's a remission so it looks like from going correctly. with both the sedative use disorder stimulant and with the so sedative stamina and opioid there's been no relapse and it looks like the the disorder is in remission Is that correct. Yes, sounds like for all of them from what you're sharing with me has been over a year since you last shoes. Okay, so lacks oxy cotton us was over a year 11 years ago less heroin use was over three years ago, less than X us was November of 2019 last crystal meth us with spring of 2019 is their history of huffing of using any cradle anything over the counter."
5896.0,Patient,I used to pray them to or withdrawals once.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, you only use it one time."
5896.0,Patient,yeah i'm.
191.0,Provider,Use credo and time.
5896.0,Patient,"I was on suboxone but not. Their prescription and I wanted to stop being on medicine period, so I just quit cold Turkey and I used the cradle from like my restless legs It made it go away."
191.0,Provider,How did it.
5896.0,Patient,It really didn't make me feel any different it just made my like lakes feel better.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so I do want you to to start to create them at one thing about the credo is that i've actually had patients get i've had a couple of people had to treat for cradle disorder."
5896.0,Patient,"That gotten, to the point where."
191.0,Provider,"They would dose in two to three hours yeah it could get really bad and then, of course, you know it's. dependent on each individual i've had people take the t's and they were taking large amounts of it every two to three hours people take the powder and. It can be i've had my people on create them be as bad as people on the heroin and fentanyl in terms of like having a dose and having a similar withdrawal and getting really super sick. yeah yeah."
5896.0,Patient,"I didn't like for like a week I needed it and then have my. Withdraw sitting there like suicide, a lot more, but I was taking quite a bit of it like three teaspoons full of it."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and it does it says a plant from Southeast Asia, and so it does have a lot of qualities, like the opioids and people do when they don't have a have someone's much like opiate withdrawal, you can get strongly hooked on it. And you know I still prefer you use the people morphine to deal with any type of opiate withdrawal, because of the buprenorphine you can post once a day or you can dose twice a day and we're not worried about your overdose and we're not worrying. You know, many people on the have never had anyone addicted create them say they actually felt normal felt like themselves. They felt like they were tracing that high all the time, with the other opiates like oxycodone and stuff like that you know. So it's it can be very devastating, even though you can find in a lot of you gas stations and supermarkets, it can be very devastating. So I definitely I want to just encourage you to not use it if you ever feel like you want to wean off of your credo, I mean that you create them you buprenorphine. i'll be happy to work with you and work you down to the lowest those two milligrams of one milligram a day and we. Have you come off of it it's just that what i've learned is that the buprenorphine is just a much safer option you don't care about people. overdose and then usually dine on a buprenorphine if they're just doing a buprenorphine you know what I mean so it's really so I want you to be really safe, so I want you to give me some teach back here what madison's do I want you to avoid and why so that you don't have overdose."
5896.0,Patient,um you will need to avoid like sedatives or the Benz those and xanax in liquor. And opioids.
191.0,Provider,"desk right definitely and so whenever you want to if you let's get you back and let's get you consistently stay with for well over a year, even. The research says, just two years at least a year and a half, and once you're getting stable stable home stable work. kids are doing fine you're safe know ups and downs with the relationship let's see about winning you down very slowly and let's get you on a low cost effective doll and let's talk about getting you off if that's your desire okay. yeah yeah."
5896.0,Patient,"yeah it was such a I didn't have a prescription and it was it was it felt like I was buying you know drugs anyway, so I just. I felt bad about doing it after a while so that's when I just quit cold Turkey, and it was it was awful."
191.0,Provider,"But I did know it's. Painful I want to read this to you under sobriety effort, because you shared something with me very personal and I want to share it with you. As a point of encouraging you to grow and you being able to know and feel complete as a single woman and at some point in time, should someone. come into your your your heart space and share your heart with you that there's somebody that will really appreciate you. For the person that you are you share it with this with me and i'm going to read it back to you patient has been recently on buprenorphine the locks on 16 milligrams per the oars last month this July of 2020.

5896.0,Patient,yeah what was that about savvy text.
191.0,Provider,"No, it was um you it looks like what you share with me was that you are currently on the subjects, but the thing.
