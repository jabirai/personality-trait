14350.0,Patient,"It got a little bit too hard to be honest with you. I think it's like you know, like. Having my sister to help me while the time that she was here, but as soon as like she left it was like. yeah it felt like you know, like you know that I was alone again. And then. What for like it's been a lot of like him, I, like the transition for disability and all the paperwork and going to doctors appointments and i'm calling here like you know in there. And then the bills they're still coming. So yeah it's going come on. A lot like you know very stressful."

14350.0,Patient,What do you mean.
214.0,Provider,"So I mean you're you're because the world's not going to change nothing, nothing in your world bills are not going to change getting the working like none of those things change or we can do is see what we can do to. accommodate it or manager right so we're finding it a little difficult to manage it right now."
14350.0,Patient,Yes. And i'm not even going back to work so. That kind of worries me.
214.0,Provider,"But, but is it is it that you have too much time by yourself and you think too much. Or you dwelling on the way you feel too much."
14350.0,Patient,"I. One of my friends she's opening a store and I even. volunteer to go and help her to organize it just to get myself BC I have to say that it was it was a challenge, because I don't mean that I can think of, is just like staying home in my bed all day. But I just like you know, like up in been over there it's just like you know it was. i'm not going to like it was hard like I felt that it was like dragging myself doing the things like you know, like helping her to organize even driving to her home like you know to. To meet her a beer, it was just. I don't I don't know it's just like a. I did it was. I was pushing myself like literally just to go out fine."
214.0,Provider,i'm sure. So i'm thinking off the top of my head that that medication isn't enough the dosage is too low.
14350.0,Patient,So I did talk to chantelle like yesterday in.

14350.0,Patient,"Well, he wasn't a one on one I I. In the Group in and it kinda like sent her a message in like a direct message, and she said that she wanted like you know, like to put me on the 20 milligrams. Because I feel like you know, like I needed."
214.0,Provider,"you're doing fine and it's okay. it's so it's what it's there for so let's let's take advantage of it, so you want me to message right now to throw in a new prescription."

14350.0,Patient,session.
214.0,Provider,"You address your medication, if you weren't getting better. You wouldn't even be attending you'd be like you know what i'll just stay in bed, so you are getting better it's very, very uncomfortable for you, I get it, I do.

In that in between mood I don't want to you found it difficult to be at the store was tough. Right um and then, when you're home alone, you probably overthinking it probably it's it's populating thoughts I know it's a rapid I get it, I get it, are you sleeping okay."
14350.0,Patient,No i'm waking up in the middle of the night.
214.0,Provider,Is a mass inno nightmares.
14350.0,Patient,"No nightmarish yeah I can recall it's just I wake up and it's hard for me to go to sleep again and then, when the five like I. I just leave like you know, like an episode, you know, like one hour two hours."
214.0,Provider,"Three hours, how long has that been going on."
14350.0,Patient,it's been since my sister in law.
214.0,Provider,Right so that's. I haven't seen you for almost two weeks. So I just want to go over some stuff if we have poor sleep it's going to impact the way you feel because your body is another rustling actually you're you're like on a continuum. You can't like you can't actually just can't stop what's going on that's why your body keeps waking up. Do you want something for the sleep.
14350.0,Patient,yeah sure.
214.0,Provider,"No, because it will help I promise you, if you can get your six seven hours sleep you won't feel like you're just constant like nothing stops it just is always on a continuum. I hold on. hold on. you're you're thinking about I guess you're in the process of disability right."
14350.0,Patient,yeah but i'm. Planning and thinking to go back to October 1 because I don't want to be my bed all day.
214.0,Provider,"I agree, I, but I think we have to think about that for a moment, are we going to be okay being overwhelmed. We know we're not okay staying in the battle of the time, we know that, but can we handle going back to work, dealing with the pressures and the phone calls, what do you think."
14350.0,Patient,"If you asked me like right now, like the way that i'm feeling I say no, but."
214.0,Provider,"Okay well little far away we're a little far away from October 1 relax take a breath will move forward, we can figure something out."
14350.0,Patient,"I hope so, because it's like. It like I don't want to lose my job."
214.0,Provider,"you're not gonna lose your job. so slow down a little bit let's not let's not always go to the the gloomy place let's let's think about what we can do now together as a team you in shanteau to figure out how to get you mostly so you get re energized, the problem is you're not running on anything has you eating."
14350.0,Patient,I either like. One once a day like.
214.0,Provider,"I know I know cuz it's an emotional roller coaster I understand. i'm just waiting for her to figure out when she can see you so she can give you the medication, because she has to sing in order to give that type of medication so we're going to figure that out in the interim. Are you thinking about what you. Instead of feeling guilty about it, or you think it should be shameful or you think about like hey this doesn't work for me, being in bed all day doesn't work for me i've got to think about how energized I am at work, how positive I am how good I am are you able to introduce those thoughts."
14350.0,Patient,"No i'm just. not really i'm just. i'm just trying to like you know, like to find things to do so, I guess."
214.0,Provider,"you're distracting, but the problem is this. You still have the emotion inside. Whatever you're feeling I know so let's just say you you're holding something even if you go distracted that's still inside like we and we got to figure that out, we need to figure that out. Let me just look at your survey. me mean your depression is is not that high your anxieties, not even that I, you may feel it's really high, but you're a mild in it, you both in mile but low miles. I mean. You can explain this better just to bring it to me and i'll explain you saw today. Yes, i'm about to finish. My role or. Now, or what time. trying to figure out how we can coordinate as soon as possible, and I think I think you feel the benefits the lexapro is going to take a minute because it's 10 milligrams. today's Wednesday, you should feel an improvement by Saturday, if we can get some sleep in there, too, you should feel overall improvement. And then October 1 should not be a problem. Have you used any of the things like the cold water, the watch any of the things that we talked about for destruction."
14350.0,Patient,"yeah well, it was just more the watch."
214.0,Provider,"In anything from it, nothing."
14350.0,Patient,It will relax me for a little bit like. It would take my mind off of always. thinking.
214.0,Provider,"Anything else you think that could be helpful, like three colors to sounds one smell see what when you're distracting you're doing a physical distraction like cooking I don't know, maybe cleaning. I, but the problem is you're holding it, but if you can do if you can do something where it incorporates all your senses like your site you're hearing your nose you'll find that this that you're holding. Will pretty much go away, but the way you're doing it, as you like Okay, if I just keep busy I won't feel this, but the problem is still there and it builds up, so we have to figure out the alternative. So there's a person called blaine blaine maxine corpus she's gonna call you to tell you, so when you see the number come through to set up this thing with chantel so if we can do this today, it would really be beneficial right. Are you finding it difficult to be like in a store."
14350.0,Patient,and Why haven't I haven't been it's.
214.0,Provider,"Like no cuz there's a lot of stimulus and I don't know if that's too much like i'm not thinking you need to shop but i'm thinking like. If you went to a walmart you went to a mall you just walked around and now your eyes, he seen things you're hearing things just smelling things like it those senses overtake. The things that you're holding it could be helpful, then, on the other end it could be more damaging, so I don't know."
14350.0,Patient,I can try.
214.0,Provider,"I think you should just try once and if you don't feel good when you're getting out of the car go back home, but I would try to do the audio visual smelling sensation to see if we can get that someone under control, you don't feel like hurting yourself now do you."
14350.0,Patient,Think.
214.0,Provider,"Vanessa it's Okay, you can look at me there's nothing. shameful it's okay it's okay i'm here for you. I am here for you. it's okay. it's totally okay. What you're going through it's totally. understandable. don't have to be ashamed of it, you don't. be scared of it. But it's good to talk about it so you're not the only one. Come on, let it go. I know I know but but we're working on it, I know I know. I know we're working on it. I know, see you're holding it. In here and it's tough. I know I know I know. Okay it's okay. it's not gonna be like this much longer we get the medications we introduce them you'll feel you'll feel the difference. So one thing you could do is get to the pharmacy and pick up the new script right that's at least going out right. I, you should really do that um.
