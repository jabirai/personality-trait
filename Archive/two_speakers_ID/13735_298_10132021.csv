298.0,Provider,Hello.
13735.0,Patient,Can I grab my.
298.0,Provider,Okay. So how is your medicine working for you.
13735.0,Patient,"it's. it's going. it's going. really well i'm the medication. is really working for me, I think the the delayed the 20 milligrams makes it really like stable. For me to just keep going on that. on that. latest stable courts for me i'm. able to focus and do everything handle everything and function, being a parent and doing everything else that I have not I haven't had any like impulsivity feelings of impulsivity feelings of. stuff like that the only thing is that my my mouth gets dry, and so I got really like capital so that's that's The worst thing. But. Because I the the time that I wasn't on the medication really took me down so right now i'm recovering from from those impulsivity things so. So."
298.0,Provider,"How many days, all that how many days if you've been out of minutes. Now you're not other meds right now. Okay, you were referring to before."
13735.0,Patient,"yeah before So when I when I go down when I don't take them that's when i'm like all over the place, so this last seven days supply it's worked it's been ongoing it's worked perfectly. But i'm just dealing with the repercussions of not taking it the week before so and I can see a drastic change like i'm just it's it's very. Very different and i'm wondering. What why it's only like a seven day supply is it because of like the addictive. A part of it or."
298.0,Provider,"Now, as I get to now you 20 milligrams is a really low dose and when I give more than that we usually end up going on a higher dose and then people are stuck on the lower dose and it's frustrating. So if I can start giving higher. Amounts when I see you, you know you're pretty much you're just having a lot of cancellations right now. But yes, as you get further into the program and I get more comfortable knowing you I go further out on my medication, but i'm not positive that this is the perfect dose for you, is it like it is."
13735.0,Patient,"um I don't know yet I don't know. I think, right now, right now, I feel good on it on the 20 milligrams um."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13735.0,Patient,"I feel really stable i'm also taking the flu oxetane with it so 40 milligrams i'm thinking of going up on the flocks of team to 60 milligrams. And then remaining 20 minutes on the on the call and then the arrow i'm going to take it, the day before yesterday because. Because I didn't have too many things to do, and I didn't want to, I just wanted to take a break from it that one day."
298.0,Provider,So that's perfectly i'm.
13735.0,Patient,That i'm.
298.0,Provider,yeah oh 100% 100% so I wrote.
13735.0,Patient,"a note on my calendar. i'm on my calendar like. i'm making a note on my calendar when I didn't take it, and why I didn't take it, and then on those days, if I see like like a symptom tracker if I see like if i'm doing these things, it means I need to check in with myself and make sure I take my medication so um. So I don't want to get what I don't want is I don't want to go through another crisis because that it it's bad you know and it gets me really. can get me in trouble and can I can't function when i'm not medicated and I it's my first time taking out also i've seen the like the the benefit of it so. I can, I can say that this is something that I. i'm. That i'm okay with I mean I don't know if I want to do this long term, but I do want to find a. more permanent. solution to this does that make sense."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. So what. I like exactly what you've said, am I, the one prescribing Prozac to you because i'll go up to six no it's somebody else and. If the lower dose of the 20 milligrams is holding you, I think that that we need to stay there, and then, when you'll notice that it's not holding you like you start getting irritable after it burns off or you're losing focus then it's time to go to the next level."
13735.0,Patient,that concerns me so. Like what's the highest dose are all goes to that you know.
298.0,Provider,"I think, is it 70 milligrams."
13735.0,Patient,yeah I don't want to ever.
298.0,Provider,yeah you know.
13735.0,Patient,"Just so you know my goal is not to get there, so I want not. How to increase if I do get irritable know and try to work backwards, like Okay, what can we do, or if there's another medication I know the much my triple metropolis not going to help with that because I can't function if i'm groggy with my kids. So I need I need to, and I have lower blood pressure, so I can't have that. So what are other options if if it got to the point where I needed to increase in because I know it's addictive and I don't want to go down that path."
298.0,Provider,If.
13735.0,Patient,you're to go to that way when does it become addictive like in in in case by case.
298.0,Provider,"If it if it became addictive it's not a physical addiction it's more of a mental addiction, so if we took it if we stopped it, you would just be gosh I wish I had it your body is not going to be craving it."
13735.0,Patient,But I will be well i'd be like irritable or like like.
298.0,Provider,"know what i've run into is some people go to they just get if they feel like they're doing well and then, when it burns off they feel irritable. And those are the things I want to know is, if that happens to you, and you know, maybe we need to switch to instead of adderall xr by Vance so i'm just watching your symptoms, to see if anything suggests that a different medication, or like that."
13735.0,Patient,What is what is by Vance.
298.0,Provider,"what's finances is another it's like adderall because it's the same kind of composition, but you and it's long acting like adderall. And it's just a different ADHD meds but along the same lines of adderall So if you do well on adderall but you're not getting the focus that extended release that you like, we can petition your company for more expensive medication called by advance. We don't need to if adderall xr is doing just fine, we can stay right where we're at."
13735.0,Patient,"I think, for now, and it's pretty good so all Cuba, I know that when I when I asked you to increase. or for more delayed, I was feeling a little irritable as soon as we're off so i'll keep i'll still keep an eye out for that I have so far I haven't had that. I actually felt. Like. Okay i'm I know i'm wearing off now i'm just tired, because I have been like handling everything that I have to handle so i'm just like okay now it's time to sleep."
298.0,Provider,"cuz I want to happen, yes. You sleep."
13735.0,Patient,"yeah so now that my. Like my kids have. I think I need to get back on my scheduled things I had I. I took on a job. I took on a job on Mondays and Wednesdays, and under impulse. And then I just now that i'm educated on like you know what. Why did I do that, so I just quit my job after two weeks because I I tend to make those drastic I can handle it all. Under impulse and then i'm like no like No, this is not realistic, this is not healthy that you're doing too much and so now that i'm medicated i'm like you know what you didn't have to take that job you acted on impulse sit down and and quit so I quit so I should have. I will be available for my. Appointment appointments."
298.0,Provider,I am glad that you saw that that's what you needed to do.
13735.0,Patient,Things. so hard to do. two more things my. So i'm trying to get the the okay so did you diagnosed me with.
298.0,Provider,"Did I diagnose you let me look at the diagnosing and see. What I did. Yes, I did I diagnose to, and I put it on your chart now diagnosis is can change, but from my assessment, I diagnosed you with a combined type of ADHD that's a little bit of high furnace with a little bit of attentiveness. I do, that it's a combination kind of."
13735.0,Patient,Like I I diagnosed SS do I know that. Okay.
298.0,Provider,Good that on August 8.
13735.0,Patient,"Okay, which with That being said, because I met with them, I met with a rock like a wraparound. family support person that I that I have for my kids and for myself. And she suggested that I get a comprehensive evaluation. To just to read my last comprehensive evaluation was when I was a teen and I had so manic depressive and ptsd and and then I had. I don't know if that was a comprehensive assessment later. But it was there thinking, I was showing symptoms of bipolar and just just associative depression."
298.0,Provider,heard that one. I know. Just.
13735.0,Patient,So no you're shut. This timing.
298.0,Provider,"i'll just think that now that I know, despite MIA uh huh."
13735.0,Patient,"Oh um but I wasn't able to clarify I didn't like that that was scary that diagnosis, so I just stopped calling them, I never went."
298.0,Provider,"So the way that diagnosis is. word is that they they kind of ebb and flow with you and so some some are very strict you know it's always going to be, but there are people who grow out of diagnosis is. Which i'm sorry if that's not what you wanted to hear and welcome ticket and get a second opinion."
13735.0,Patient,"No that's fine, so I just want to know. If how did you assess also for bipolar or. Do you see any of those. Any of those just dynamic depression."
298.0,Provider,"I diagnosed moderate depressive major depressive disorder moderate when I assess you I did not see. I did not see bipolar when I assess you back. And I diagnosed you with anxiety, but you know that. generalized anxiety disorder. Things that I may add down the road is ptsd as I get to know you and stuff I may add that to your problems list um. It does show how you're responding to treatment with the Prozac a good thing, I think that the adderall is going to work on the depression and you start should start seeing depression lighten and we may start to scale that depression down. I I need to get going, is there anything else, I can do to help you."
13735.0,Patient,"um, how can I get a copy of my diagnosis."
298.0,Provider,"asked for it at the front desk you know the virtual clinic. You can ask for. My notes on you anything you want, you can ask for."
13735.0,Patient,"Okay, and then for know what so every seven days i'm just request to refill."
298.0,Provider,"So I have you I gave you 14 days, because you sound pretty stable right now on the adderall so I gave you a 14 I don't think i'm going to be switching it in seven days, and you can request refills when I see you in. Okay."
13735.0,Patient,Just chat Thank you so much.
298.0,Provider,Thank you take care bye bye.
