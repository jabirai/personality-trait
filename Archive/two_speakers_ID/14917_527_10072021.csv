527.0,Provider,Okay.
14917.0,Patient,"I mean i've held, I have a rifle by gave it back to my my dad because i'm one incident where I was just super drunk and I was crying like non stop.

Know it's it's kind of like I had it like in my mouth, when I was just kind of like ready to do it, but. Okay, something just kept stopping something to tell me not to do it. But then the other side could tell me to do it."
527.0,Provider,As soon.
14917.0,Patient,"After that incident I just said, I can't do this. I can't I can't and I gave it. To my dad I told him hey just you know take care of your having I told him i'm an excuse i'm like oh i'll have any room for my room. Okay, the key just you know hold on to it for me."

14917.0,Patient,No.
527.0,Provider,Any wishes to be dead.
14917.0,Patient,couple times gone by.
527.0,Provider,"So what we'll do. Jorge is go through a safety plan will put it together the two of us, and then I email you a copy of it that way you have it, if we need to make changes to it as we progress through treatment, we can certainly do that, but will at least get an initial one in place for you. Any history of self harm behaviors."
14917.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, not really no."
527.0,Provider,Any history of homicidal thoughts or attempts to harm anybody else.
14917.0,Patient,No never.
527.0,Provider,"So, as far as like the safety fan, and if we i'm going to go ahead and do it with you that way. Can I get. This. While we're while we're on on it, and I can keep my thoughts straight here if you had to pick or identify like the top three triggers for your suicidal thoughts, what would those be for you."
14917.0,Patient,"um. The top three triggers for probably like there's times, where I feel like. I get this burst of energy like. excite me I guess i'm not really sure like I hang out my friends, sometimes I work where I worked not copying very like happy about like oh yeah i'm falling hanging out with friends and like I said I can turn on turn out to be like not just. Like a little. Good too little too exciting I with them and, like, I feel like i'm embarrassed embarrassed myself like I just feel like oh man like they probably think i'm. Like stupid or something they probably think i'm just like annoying or i'm embarrassing or something like that I just that really triggers it really hard like. Okay support like I don't want to be at the event anymore I just wanna go home drink and just like. kill myself, you know it's like i'm like worthless and stuff like that."
527.0,Provider,So a lot of negative negative self talk it sounds like that you have. Your okay. Jim to other triggers.
14917.0,Patient,"um. I guess, just like i'm. Like why mess up or something they got work or something like that. Okay, well done while do my job right. Okay, I do something wrong and just like. That triggers a bit. um. well. i'll say just like there's times, where it just comes randomly like go pop in my head like okay i'll just be like doing something normal like Ryan paperwork at work and it just comes up like hey you can't kill yourself OK."
527.0,Provider,"And then, if you had to identify we usually try to do these in groups of three and three like coping strategies that you use like just kind of internal ones that help you work through those thoughts when they when they come."
14917.0,Patient,"Oh no honestly you just. guess i'm just too damn stops me the most like i'm too scared to do it, I guess. You know there's not really anything I do I just kind of like I guess I just didn't do tons I know now i'm not going to do it."
527.0,Provider,Is there anything particular that you like say to yourself or kind of reassure yourself or talk through.
14917.0,Patient,"Oh i'll just keep excuse my language, but just keep. More merciful pussy like you're not going to do."
527.0,Provider,"And anything else that you do, do you ever like just like listen to music or take Walker."
14917.0,Patient,"are used to like are you something music I love playing video games and stuff like. That I just haven't been like. i've lost interest on my favorite things Okay, you know it's just like I try playing games i'm just like I hate it like I won't do it anymore listen to music on the side calluses the same songs anymore, because it just reminds me of those bad times. Okay, I don't want to go back to that. So this is this whole thing ruined everything I love you know."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay yeah. Anything else that you do or do you talk to anybody or.
14917.0,Patient,"No, I don't talk to nobody, I know I should it's just I can't I can't come on man so i'm not supposed to talk to people about this stuff yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Alright, so we may have to come up with another another coping mechanisms so that kind of leads us into the next section here, so if we look at. Like outside like social settings are distractions that you can use, you know when you're having those thoughts and then you mentioned that video games and music aren't working anymore, but is there, other things that you do like do you just. own throw yourself into work, or you know."
14917.0,Patient,"yeah I talked to some of my co workers on. This one co worker that I really get along with the most on. me her are like into like the same music. We love heavy metal love rock music and. We try going to concerts together, you know. her and her husband and me my girlfriend he tried going together, and all I talked to her the most about this stuff and. she's going to so much to mentally and she's getting help to them. we're trying to talk to each other about it, you know so it's probably not a good thing, but we like to make jokes about. Killing ourselves I guess you know, like I know it's probably not investing you know it's just it's cold, we understand each other, you know. So and it's just like a we'd say any jokes or dark humor like that to someone else will target buyer but I mean her we're just like we get our dark humor. And also like there's another co worker, I have to that I like I, like all my coworkers but. She brings her son into work and I just love spending time with her son. Like I wish I could be an uncle. or. You know, but no, no, my siblings have any relationship stuff. And then every time whenever he comes over always play with him always. Give by him like toys and stuff like that, and I wish I wish I was an uncle."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah do you do, you get to spend much time with them."
14917.0,Patient,"Oh, not as much. But we tried to on the weekend, you know or she brings them. into work and we try to always make plans, like last weekend, we had. A little dinner for all have sinned on. She brought her son and. My co workers who they are, my friends, like all the friends are there and stuff like. It was fun, you know we all play games and. you'll make s'mores for the kids and stuff like that."
527.0,Provider,"Oh good good. Anything else there's two I got two of them, you got one more thing that you do that helps to give you a distraction."
14917.0,Patient,"I used to like to own. Like workout and kickboxing like. Work on. And stuff because I feel like I felt like if I was too tired to exhausted like I won't have time to think about all these bad thought to like i'm to. sleep like you know something that. or i'm focusing like on the soreness of my muscles like from the day. Okay, like mentally like I couldn't care less about killing myself."

To address it, will you know, will certainly. get to the point of hopefully being able to work on it together and process through it. But yeah it's just going to take some time you know there's definitely a lot of feelings attached to when there is abuse and trauma. And and it's not uncommon to you know have kind of stuffed that memory away, and then it POPs back up later that's that's not uncommon with with trauma experiences. You know, some people can kind of push it aside and and you know really hold it down in their memories, for a long time, and then it can resurface. You know when stresses and triggers come about again and so sometimes it's like whoa wait a minute How did this come back to me but that's usually kind of how it presents itself there's been like some services."
14917.0,Patient,"mean it makes it worse, because I got here every day, you know. he's always at the House who my brother's my uncle and he always there.

But if you've got enough to get you through till group on Tuesday, then you can she'll get you another refill for that. Okay, and i'm not sure how she does her refills. So I can't really answer that question for you. that's that's her job is all the medication so but but yeah just make sure you come on Tuesday for groups so and then, as far as our appointments.

I will certainly work with her as far as you know, because you're not the only one that has. You know, concerns with fees and things for group so i'm going to definitely let me see what it looks like, if I can see, on your groups here. Okay, so it looks like it's $17 and 50 cents for group therapy."

527.0,Provider,"You have a $35 copay as well. And I don't know where you're at as far as yes, because what's going to happen Just to give you a heads up, but if you have any questions you can always check with the financial department at bright heart. But it looks like if you don't show for an appointment you're in you get billed $50. You go, so you don't want to get that bill stuck on yeah. So yeah. yeah if so that is so you can avoid that so. Yes, so and I don't know what your deductible is to to meet that like for co pays and things to go away. But yeah it looks like you'll have our sessions are going to be it looks like $35 and $35. For if you meet with chantel individually for an appointment and then your group is 1750 with your copay it looks like."
