405.0,Provider,"Likewise, I know Julie been in contact with me and I looked at your record jimbo just start by asking what is it that you're passionate about in money."
9051.0,Patient,That i'm passionate about in life. helping others. and using technology to do it is the simplest way to explain it.
405.0,Provider,"Okay, how do you like to help others and how to use technology to achieve that end."
9051.0,Patient,"Oh wow. i'd say. Well, I mean. Technology itself has been so helpful to you know humanity with all we've achieved and continue to achieve and. The potential of it. And all the various ways um. I don't know there's there's a lot that sparks my. passion for it, I you know. fascinated with so many different disciplines and and. sections of technology, mostly being computers, but everything is a computer now in our watches our phones all full fledged incredibly powerful computer so that's my my background. i'm as a system administrator technician. For the last 20 years i'm trying to change. Excuse me i'm trying to change over into software engineer and that's i've tried to do many times throughout the years. I. was a lyft driver from full time from February 2017 to August 2019 and i've met so many prominent people at the various companies throughout the bay area and. left a good enough impression for them to leave their info and you know reach out for any you know if I can help you in any way and I bought courses books trying to learn software engineering and like fill in that skill gap to to get there. switch over and and, finally, like make a much better income, then I was getting a lyft driver, which was exhausting 10 hours you know days six days a week 12 hour days. And it was just so frustrating. So that. That bothered me that I was doing lift driving away longer than I planned, especially with all the maple with all the people. That a friend of mine said i'd likely encounter because he did left driving but was not have a technical background it's like oh you you meet so many amazing people I met the CEO of Twitter, you know my car it's crazy like i'm sure your encounter people and he was right, but. Not knowing. What was really the core of my problem in focusing on studying just it never happened, you know, during that time, it still has yet to happen. But um yeah I came across a. Sorry, I tend to ramble all that, let me, let me know if you have additional questions."
405.0,Provider,"Thank you, James i'm just trying to get to know you, so this is helpful, thank you."
9051.0,Patient,"yeah I came across a thread on Twitter or actually before that I came across a tweet by a guy I was following and he says shout out to the people who thought they were losers, but didn't know they had ADHD this was. September 2019 just mere days after I stopped being a driver I just happened to come across this tweet and i'm like. Like interesting for him the phrase that an interesting for someone to say that about ADHD which I really don't know much about at that time. And then, just a few days later um, I guess, because I like that or interact with that another. thread made its way onto my timeline and the thread was what was your oh my God I didn't know that was ADHD moment so curious again I click on this thread. and start reading through it and people are saying various things and and I read like 10 different tweets didn't relate to him. On the 11th tweet and for the next 30 tweets I could not help but relate tool and, as I got near like the end of scroll of that I literally tear it up, I had tears in my eyes, because. To some eyes, because it's like it's like in that moment coming across that information for the first time in my life. there's an answer for why I am the way I am and things that I thought were unique were about me or my way of thinking, our approach and stuff or my hangups. It was just thing that I knew nothing about that no one had ever mentioned to me before that I had never come across that until you know now or back then. and It was eye opening and i'm like well I don't have an official diagnosis, but I am more than positive like this is describing me on such a scale that's that's. Just haunting you know the the the the details and what these other people who have this thing called ADHD are going through it, you know i'm not one of those people that. Like attention or oh yeah yeah I I probably have that thing around this or that you know i'm not quick to jump to. Trends or or you know i'm not impulsive in that way. But yeah it was undeniable and I have built up such a wonderful a connection and Group of Friends and i've learned so much about it and continue to there's there's some things I come across and i'm like Okay, what a part of me isn't ADHD related like you know things that again. More things about thought were just unique to me or you know behavior patterns personality and i'm reading tweets of five other people and they're saying things that I do in such detail it's like I have a camera hidden in my room. But it's been great I I can't. say enough how wonderful that the Twitter ADHD and and you know neuro neuro divergent another term I learned community is you know so many people that have ADHD as well as autism or just autism or just ADHD um so yeah I it was it was a very. Interesting journey. What brought me to bright heart was at the end of 2020. I was two days after Christmas, I was in an extremely dark place, I felt like. There was no hope, you know as much as I was learning about ADHD I didn't have control of it, you know I didn't have. meant, you know, like people would say, have helped them so much you know, like a kind of you know, brings about clarity and allows your you know you to get things done for X amount of hours each day. And you know difficulty studying and now they're able to study and you know that's that's been my thing for years, the inability to. to study to actually you know set a time get rid of distractions and try to do a course or e book that i've purchased and. Reading and rereading the same paragraph over and over and over and my mind just wondering, you know I read one little thing, and my thought process to shoots off until another you know whole thing. Or, I read a word and oh yeah and and I open up a search tab and i'm googling something and it's just it's just such a frustrating thing and to have. People on the outside looking in and just say oh you just you don't just don't want it bad enough you're just lazy you're just not driven and that hurts so much when they can't they can't come inside of my mind. and see just how hard i'm trying and have tried so many times throughout the years you know way before learning about ADHD what you know ADHD. is and how it affects a person just you know my my. Looking back my past it's so evident that this has been my struggle, you know all the all the signs are there. So. yeah i'm bright heart end of December 2020. I was out of hope and, like most people who feel they have no hope no. Future left that you know there it's it's not worth life isn't worth living, I was in that dark place I I went communications black turned off my phone my messaging Apps no one could reach me. And i've been watching videos of methods that people have tried in things that work things that were 50 you know, I was weighing all the I was approaching I like it wasn't project what's the likelihood that this particular route is going to succeed."
405.0,Provider,returns enjoying yourself.
9051.0,Patient,"Correct and the one thing. On my important to do list before I would carry out such thing was finding a place for my dogs to go, and you know, have a nice place to be. And I couldn't I had a block, I could not figure out. Who I could leave them with without tipping off what I was actually up to. And because of that I didn't go through it, so you know they saved my life, you know. So I said, you know what. screw it, I want to give this one last shot full effort and I reached back out to. The mental health liaison and that's when she put me in touch with the intake person at bright heart and then weeks later, I had my official diagnosis by Mary kastner and you know met Julie. i've attended 95% of the weekly group group meetings, without fail. And then, and had a number of one on one sessions i've you know i've messed up in this stills but i've gotten better at changing the settings in my. In my outlook calendar and to actually pop up with reminder if it doesn't pop up I won't I won't catch it and remember you know that I have an appointment today. So anyway um. yeah I feel I should pause and give you a chance."
405.0,Provider,"Thank you. Know you've covered a lot of ground, which is supposed to give me a sense of some of your your work, history and then some of the struggles that you. You were you ended up identifying just fortuitously it sounds like but that's Twitter feed and the ADHD and. You described significant difficulty with concentrating and sustaining their attention, or if you start reading something, then a word you start to think about something else was hard to get through a paragraph and you want to. Train yourself in terms of the software programming the readings, to become the develop the skill set to become a software engineer. And yet it's extremely challenging for you to be able to follow through with the task that you set for yourself and that's frustrating defeating I imagined demoralizing and. Then you were able to happen to. read these Twitter feeds and then you became more familiar with the Community the neuro diverging ADHD community that. That helps to alleviate that sense of loneliness I imagine them feeling like there was something wrong with you that you didn't identify could name and so that measure that was very relieving. So I appreciate you sharing with me what you have, and you said that, as you look back at these are struggle that. You you, you can remember struggling with now that you have the words to describe them James can you describe what it was like for me, as you grew up, who was in the whole what were your relationships like how our emotions express."
9051.0,Patient,"So. My biological father was around for the first. five to seven years. I didn't see him on a regular basis, like every weekend, it was kind of like every like once a year, every other year type thing for those first seven years and then after age seven. I you know never saw him again we. ended up moving from I was born in Los Angeles, where they're moving from Los Angeles out to riverside. And you know, being the 80s, you know if you want to find someone one you kind of gotta go look for them, you know if you can certainly call and and locate them so. That was what my mom told me she went to the address she laughs knew of him and he had no longer live there, so no I fell out of touch with my father and then."
405.0,Provider,We got like region.
9051.0,Patient,"Well, my mom was my world, so you know my father, he was a nice guy was a cool guy you know he's a captain of a motorcycle club. And in a in a martial artists as well, so he was great you know and do it the interactions all it's great, but then all the gaps from disappearing and I was just was really attached to my mom so. I mean, maybe on a on a. subconscious level it bothered me but just on a conscious level, you know as long as I had her you know, like, I was fine. And then three years later. um what would become my stepfather for 15 years he entered the picture, so there was a father figure around, and you know, he was into computers and electronics auto moto and all that stuff. So yeah. One interesting memory, looking back. And this really bothers me. Because. It was a chance to get help, then you know and the memory is. H seven I was a attending this very nice school out in the Pacific palisades and I had this really nice teacher and. At the end of the school day she came out to my mom and was talking to her, this is a story my mom told me I barely remember it. But she was talking to my mom and she said. i'd like to have James to do some tests, because I think he may have you know trouble. Learning and and and and you know progressing in class. So my mom being the proud woman, she is, and you know very intelligent. You know overachiever type personality, you know she had a. invested in encyclopedia set which is you know for 500 $600 back then to have in the House, so that we have you know resources to learn and and better ourselves and all that. So she said to me if you get an A on the next spelling test i'll give you 20 bucks and that's all she said she didn't help me she didn't she just set that reward goal, and of course that made me very excited you know $20 to a seven year old in the in the 80s that's that's significant. And sure enough that i'm. excitement that I could give that just by remembering how to spell words. I I did it and she said, my teacher came out to me just completely uh you know taken aback and I don't know what happened, he got. You know, not only did you get, although the record words right he even got some of our heart, you know he got all the bonus words. are right that, even though the smartest people in the class struggled with a math test, and you know that was a proud moment for her like told you, nothing wrong with my son. But I don't know you know I can't go and contact that teacher, but whatever she saw she saw there was something there and. You know my my own analysis of it is the reward the doping reward of the $20 whatever my normal flow was of being in class and going about interacting with class and doing assignments of. Whatever those blocks were or whatever the teacher observed. Because I was so focused on that $20 I you know. I got past whatever things that I normally struggle with all because of the dope Amina rush of wanting that reward so I don't know I don't know if that seems logical."
405.0,Provider,"can make sense that, if you think James from what you remember, maybe not as young as seven. Do you remember when you were in class as far back as you can remember it was hard to pay attention to the. The teacher where you're forgetful of homework or your book bag or placing a lot of your schoolwork alive were you getting in trouble for talking a lot or getting up and down we're going around a lot."
9051.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm getting up and down and moving around not really I could stay, you know in my chair and I didn't you know I really liked whatever school supplies that were purchased that year, so I wasn't in the habit of losing books or supplies or my backpack. But my mind wandering and talking and not focusing on the work that has been evident throughout my entire. You know, school history, if you will, and a high school high school I did better because I have certain teachers that were always engaging you know they they were fun and they held my attention and it wasn't you know the you know old man or old lady with the. You know. boring tone voice, like the guy from the clear eyes commercial. So you know it wasn't a personality that put you to sleep for the teachers that were lively and like. fun and they they really captured my interest on the course I did well in most classes for the classes, where the teacher was just you know priced himself on being the tough teacher, you know what the tough class that's hard to pass, and you know we're kind of just. I don't know um. You know, whatever their deal was, I did not do that well um. college college was interesting in college kind of boosted my. Confidence because here it is i'm in college, you know. and Community college and college, nonetheless, and I am doing pretty decent and various classes um but or, at least in the first part of the year. um but yeah to get an A on a college, you know assignment it kind of said to me like oh man my teacher sucked I did so my teacher sucked because here I am at the College level doing well doing better than I was at the high school level. So yeah. yeah but you know that was the early years i've. taken a break away from going to college and i've gone back to it and i've always struggled with. Just. being consistent, you know. Completing the assignment. There was a. Accounting class that the job I was working back in 2008 that they wanted me to take. to become an accountant, because you know that's the kind of the role I slipped into temporarily work in there. That the CFO actually wanted me to know accounting versus what I picked up on a job and taking that night class after being at work for eight hours a day in like focusing on that. Accounting in general, I found fascinating you know that it truly is the lifeblood of any company and essential to know but. absorbing that information in the form of that class, you know, a night class of you know, getting off work driving you know 45 minutes to an hour from you know my job to the College and like yeah. So. The trying to think of any more notable moments regarding school and education."
405.0,Provider,"What made you to stop the Trinity College, initially, let me just stop attending classes finished."
9051.0,Patient,"So, this would like I i'll be 40 this year I graduated in high school in 2000 so the. The. The original plan actually was graduate high school. And either it's in San Jose state for mechanical engineering or attended the Academy of art for a degree in computer animation. And that didn't happen. I didn't have any scholarships financial aid when I apply for financial aid, I didn't qualify for it because of they said on paper, it looks like my parents make enough to afford to send me there. Which. In retrospect, if i'm remembering the details right doesn't make sense, because you're an adult at that point you're you're kind of like disconnected and independent of any one, so your parents income shouldn't matter at age 18 pursuing I don't know but. So that didn't happen and that that heard and that's when I went to the Community college route instead instead of the you know straight shot to a four year. The. reason I guess I fell off back then or didn't complete you know my my two year degree I I was excited at the beginning of the year excited to you know. I love learning. You know that's that's been a constant I love learning i've learned so many little things over the years. across a insane amount of different subjects, but I guess. college. You know the excitement at the beginning of the year and then halfway through the year the the same excitement not being present. The same drive not being. present. And that was that was always my my mom's thing was, you know that she i'm the youngest of three kids have a brother has nine years older and I sister is four years older than me or thing was you graduate high school, you have two options. Go work full time and help with your it. or. You can go to school, full time and focus on school. or part time or part time school. So. Initially it was. You know, go to school for time, but I wasn't I just I just didn't have the the the the same enthusiasm and drive a focus at the beginning of the year. To actually finished a courses, you know and it sucked because you know, these were being paid out of pocket it wasn't financial aid left luckily. Courses back then were not insanely expensive it's like $11 in unit and that course you know the catalogs of various colleges today and i'm like. it's not $11 a unit. You know, books have always been expensive, but at least the the the cost per unit was. Was decent beyond reason it was it was affordable and wow what has changed in two decades. Well yeah that that's that's a what I can recall from school."
405.0,Provider,"Thank you for elaborating James as you were growing up, did you ever experienced any unwanted physical or sexual contact."
9051.0,Patient,"um, no, no, the household was pretty. Pretty uh. You know I felt so safe and and whatnot other than the things that kids normally go through with the arguing with older siblings and that. pranks and teasing and all that stuff."
405.0,Provider,Were you bullied at all at school.
9051.0,Patient,"Thankfully, no or not not. Not for long you know i'm you know, President day i'm six foot four and, unfortunately, like 440 pounds, but I was always big you know for each. era or age of growing up, you know always does a taller bigger one and. You know I loved I loved making friends, you know another quality my mom said about me was. She never had to worry about me getting mixed up with the wrong crowd I was already selective of what what friends, I chose to get close to like you know, have a have a friendship with. yeah I had a had a boolean in ninth grade but luckily. That night three fourth grade when I was nine and i'm fortunately you know it probably halfway through the school year I. It ended up. I wouldn't say I befriended him but it became I became less of his focus, you know. um so yeah that's that's the only bullying. That I could recall directly high school, there were tensions. With some of you know, the other students but all out bullying like I just i've always hated bullies so I never was one to. tolerate much and luckily I didn't get into to really any fights in high school."
405.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you i'm just getting a sense of what your experiences have been like and you think back to childhood and teenage years, did you notice any. Even that the beginning of struggles with feeling depressed struggling with yourself worth anxiety excessive worry."
9051.0,Patient,"Oh yes, Oh yes, I had a you know my stepfather. was very frustrating during my teenage years. You know, we got alone, for the most part, but he was a very opinionated and proud. Guy you know, one of the things he said. You know, he always he always assume the worst you know he always kind of lumped me in what the general teenager which made me mad because I knew I thought and felt differently than the average teenager. And you know saying things. With a. One of the one of the things that are actually have any personal with that personality is given out your opinions as though they're facts, you know, like oh I. i'll tell you what you're thinking you were thinking that you know and, like any conversation that starts with outside with you were thinking versus asked me what I was thinking how I felt, you know, like man so much rage and anger with that. And then, when I moved out our relationship got way better and there was more respect like instantly in 2004 when they moved back down to southern California. And then he was no longer in my life after 2007 they got divorced so. yeah it was it was. It was very upsetting you know there's so many times as a teenager where I would be depressed and feel hopeless phil misunderstood. You know, suicidal. ideation you know thinking about visualizing the impact of me me no longer being around and what it would be like an impact and and if i'm honest almost like a like a revenge thing like. Know you've you've made my life so hard i'll show you you're going to be so. Sad i'm gone, you know. yeah lots lots of that. So yeah. it's just been it's just been a struggle like you know, unless something you know I I went to I told you about the end of 2020 but just several weeks ago or. Two weeks yeah two weeks ago, so 10th. I was also in a dark place at the end of 2021 and. It was a similar thing, but the main the main theme of it and thought process was. I am so tired of of failure, being the norm for me, you know. talk with the friend a couple of days ago and i'm like Have you had any thoughts about time being that it's 2022 like. Have you compared this point to another point oh it's been 15 years since i've been married or it's been such and such and such. And he's like no I really haven't and then later in the conversation he started bringing up things that depresses both about how old, we are now and i'm like now you're doing it. But um no I was, I was doing that I was, I was looking back. On just all the other things i've i've tried to become and just fill that you know, for every goal I set in and it got to me that. To be optimistic and after failure after failure after failure and say. Okay, that didn't work, let me try this and it reminds me of the story of the cleaning product formula for all night, you know the the chemist tried 408 times to get the formula right and on the next attempt the 499 cent. You got the right name the product after that and. I I feel like that's been me except I haven't hit success, I haven't achieved anything and all the while everyone around me people that i've taught computers and how to you know that i've helped give careers to literally. um. You know, like they took what I taught them and ran with it, and like it's embarrassing that you know i'm the guy that everybody says, has so much potential, you know the guy that everybody's expecting so much of. It to still to to turn 40 in August of this year. And i'm not i'm not trying to negatively foreshadow what August is going to look like, but i'm saying like approaching 40 and and nothing. Notable to speak of you know I I dream big and and I see the path to make those dreams come I just can't execute the plan. that's another thing i'm i've had many conversations and i've said countless friends throughout the years. i'm great at making plans my plans are sound, if I run a plan by somebody they're like yeah that's a great plan that could work that's a great that's a great solution to that problem terrible at executing the plan carrying it out from from agency."
405.0,Provider,What do you think makes it challenging through the execution.
9051.0,Patient,"Just just the same determination and consistency and drive, day in and day out. I had a simple goal at the beginning of December, it was a course on Python programming. That are bought off of a website called you demi calm and i've bought many courses over there. it's a 30 hour course, and you know it's it's video driven and you follow along you see the instructors screen, you have access to the same website or free software that he's using. And you follow along and take you know, like that's that's the basis of all their you know video tutorial courses and. I got about four hours into it and. I ran out of steam, as my mom would say you know I didn't have. The drive the motivation to the the. clear thinking to to resume the next day with the same enthusiasm as the day before and. You know. If I if I was tired take a nap okay wake up. Through some coffee and sit down open the course and i'm staring you know at the course of two displays i'm staring at the. course on on one screen and my you know editor, on the other, and. i'm just like my brain my brain is is not going to allow me to do this right now I don't want to do it it's something i'd like to do. But I can't get myself to do it, and this is something I see people tweet and struggle with a lot, you know, like. You know, only only having so many. I believe that analogy was spoons a select number stones in a day like Oh, you have today you have three spoons so of the 10 things you want to do you have to choose three of those that you'll actually do um and I relate to that, I mean i've try. I try and have tried so many things to just get through a typical week, and what I mean by that is you know, I have two dogs and. i'm grateful to them, because of the natural need of them needing to be walk you know I live in. By downtown over lake merritt so I don't have a backyard, you know, I have to walk them twice a day at least. So needing to do that and get out the House i've learned to piggyback on top of a running task sorry I attended. Switching like i'm talking about a computer program or something but i'm. piggyback on top of a running task, meaning okay I didn't feel like leaving the House but I had to walk my dogs, I have my shoes on I just got done walking them Okay, I already have my shoes on, let me just go ahead and take the trash out. So I take the trash out and i'm like you know it's a you know to ground level parking lot, then the first floor, then the second floor I am and then the third so like i'm down in the parking lot and i'm like Okay, I took the trash out. Really don't feel like going to the grocery store, but if I go to the grocery store to pull these right next door, and you know I can you know, so I literally got a sweet talk myself. Alright, that like i'm negotiating with my own. Brain like. hey if we go to safeway we can get remotely and also more you know pumpkin pie or. German chocolate cake like I got to excite myself. But those are physical things I can have success with physical things. You know I haven't been working for two years, my last job was. After I stopped lift driving a few months later, I got a job work going on Amazon prime delivery. hardest job of my life. Just wow amazon's something else. But. I was willing to stay with the job, but they ended the Program. You know, everybody got laid off a genius January 2 so it's been two years of employment, another thing that has eaten that me because. I had all this free time I if if I was able to focus from the beginning of this pandemic. I probably be making like 300 K right now with all this stuff I would have been able to learn just having so much free time and access to all the content, you know that's what first reach me, I have a. Decent computer a very decent computer I have all the software have decent Internet I have everything I need except. The the focus and and and. You know these various mental blocks of speed bumps and objects that get in the way of me wanting to achieve you know, whatever goal."
405.0,Provider,whirling.
9051.0,Patient,"looks are. demoralizing yeah so it's extremely demoralizing it's in you know, and I felt that. With. You know meeting people oh hey do you do do, are you a lyft driver. part time oh actually my my backgrounds in tech i'm just lift driving right now I learned software engineering, I have said that line you know the beginning of a ride. So many times, I draw so much. At the when I when I the last day that I drove you know you do on the APP or should you have any ride you've done. I did 12,112 rides and those two and a half years of lift driving and i've met. You know, because each ride is just a single person, it could be harmful of people or three people two people. um so I estimate i've met at least 20,000 people so i've had so many conversations, how was joking, with a friend of mine, who was a driver at the time. And I was like yeah man i'm so tired of telling people that like there are days, this week, or like, how do you do lift driving our full time yep that's it that's that's all I do i'm a driver like my father his father before you know, like just just kind of a. what's the expression. Is self self deprecating you know, like comedians do they make fun of themselves. Right yeah but it's a. it's just it just got to me, and you know, like like you said excellent you know attitude it's it's it's demoralizing and. To to you know my close friend, he says he doesn't believe in luck, he believes in preparation meets opportunity. And there were so many opportunities to get into a job that oh wow you're learning software engineering. Here, to take take my car we're looking for our software engineers, but what what exactly what you're studying and i'm like oh no, no, you know I don't I don't have. The skills, yet i'm still like you know, a month into this course that's Okay, you know reach out when you're done, and done never came done never happened. And, and then again meeting someone else or i'm i'm actually on site at Facebook or i'm at Google or i'm at industrial light and magic and i'm picking up people. And you know we we start talking tech or you know how do you like working here and Oh, you know a lot of you know a lot about. Such a such a year in tech yeah my backgrounds as a SIS admin but in honest like it just so much of that just played back i'm in my head it just. i'm trying to see something new one i'm trying to have a different outcome than what i've been used to that that's why I felt low two weeks ago. that's why I felt. Out of hope because, excuse me. Because you know, things were in motion i'm officially diagnosed with ADHD I i've learned a lot about it, you know from the Community as as well, as you know, Julie and therapy sessions and i've taken wellbutrin Ritalin at all, and now recently concert a 54 milligram. and none of them have had an effect adderall had an effect of making me feel panicked it was a feeling of. something's gonna happen, I don't know what it is, but I have to be prepared for it like it's if I were to translate it in the words that's fulfilling that are all gave me and I told me everybody shut up stop taking it, so I said okay um. So i'm just i'm just looking i'm still i'm still optimistic i'm looking for that that euphoric moment that so many people have spoken of oh I finally you know I switched to medicine X and wow what a difference, like. This is what a normal brain functions, like, I was able to get five hours of studying and I, and I smile and i'm so happy for them. And i'm like what is my moment company, you know, like it's so. that's that's a. I don't know it's i'm pretty sure I could I could go another couple hours just. Talking about various stages feelings. That I feel like i've conveyed the majority of of past, present and what I would like to see."
405.0,Provider,"Right sure jungle, I definitely hear the desperation you want so desperately to to achieve your goals and you're clear about what those goals are the frustrating. Experience time and again, is that the execution like you described in that I appreciate your cognizant of the time i'm able to go past the scheduled end of the hour, if you're able to so we can continue to come. On the station, I know that."
9051.0,Patient,have some. notes it's more important okay.
405.0,Provider,"All right, appreciate Julie plan to connect you with another of our prescribers, but I think, at least for us to continue to speak for me to better get a sense, I think that could only be helpful if you're willing to appreciate it. Absolutely James what is anybody in your family related by blood it's diagnosed with any kind of psychiatric illness or substance use disorder that you're aware of ADHD depression bipolar anxiety panic."
9051.0,Patient,"Officially, know and I laugh when I say that because once I saw the the traits and characteristics of myself, I immediately identify people in my life, especially family that behave the way I do down to um you know the every last detail, you know my my aunt. The oldest of four sisters my mom's the the third oldest or second youngest. And my aunt she she lives here in the Bay area in San Jose she's lived up here way before we moved up. And Whenever she would come around like the two of us, we would just talk and and like always enjoy talking to each other, you know um and. You know, so I I see clearly like oh yeah yeah she definitely fits the the ADHD mold. And then my mom as well, like there are things I had no idea or connected, you know, like such as like the the the wiggling of your foot or leg, you know when you're when you're sitting idle and. you're bored or not bored like you know my mom and I both did that and we didn't know we did that, like she she lived with me from 2014 to 2017. Regarding my mom Sadly, I have not been able to have the conversation and the Epiphany of home, while have ADHD and so much make sense. She had a event happen in June of 27 team where i'm so she had a. She got diagnosed with carpal tunnel back in 1996 by 2000 it had progressed to a second stage, known as rst or reflex sympathetic dystrophy and she also has a herniated disc as well, so she has a chronic pain condition. And with that came the need for a wheelchair a specialized van and very, very heavy pain meds slash narcotics um and then what changes with the the the law and the way you know medicine is authorized um I think in. it's become a real struggle for people who are in need of that and. To get that approved so it's always a battle for her to get her medicine approved and review panel, and this, and this and that Madam i'm pretty sure you know about that or less. So anyway, it was June 2017 they had denied her medication refills. And she started having withdrawals was feeling terrible and I proposed well I have friends who you know I don't smoke, but I have friends who do you know the. marijuana as a way to you know deal with physical pain and you know it, you know works well for them, do you want to try that so she was let me think about it and. So finally she's like yeah let's give it a try, so you know anything's better than you know what i've been having to endure it. So I, and I know nothing about this world, so I reached out to a friend like hey what what's good he's like well there's this type that type, this is good for this that's good for that sounds like here here's 200 bucks just bring back a. mixed bag of you know, whatever. So you brought back some edible chocolate bars a pen and everything and she tried it and there was pretty much an overnight change in her pain level and it helped along with that came very disturbing a. Psychological changes as well um things that she started to do, she never did before things she hadn't done in 20 years you know one thing about her was her pain. Only allowed her to sit for about 15 minutes, once you started doing the the marijuana she would be sitting out on the balcony I kid you not for eight hours straight, it was it was it was. It was supernatural in a sense, um but also notice like random laughing random crying behavior she did not exhibit before so anyway, some research showed they're so small population of people that marijuana actually has a bad effect on and. it's got it's been such a struggle, because she's kind of been like a loose cannon she ended up moving back down to so cow, but then like what the personality changes, she didn't. But overnight wanted nothing to do with her sisters, it was almost like she reverted back to who she was in the early 90s. um the way she talked wearing jewelry showing it's going to sound strange but chewing bubble gum um These are all things that we vividly remember my siblings remember from from then and i'm so. We haven't been able, because she has this completely different personality and it's and it's remained. We haven't been able to like formally find out what's going on with her. My uneducated non psychiatry's qualified analysis, the marijuana trigger some type of schizophrenia um because I say schizophrenia because that's what. Read him about schizophrenia her behaviors consistent with that and. I just talked to a friend, two weeks ago and she's like oh so you know it's your mom still in your life and I explained and she's like oh my God the same exact thing happened to my cousin the marijuana calls verbatim what you said happened to your mom so. anyway."
405.0,Provider,So heartbreaking. To where your mom's deterioration.
9051.0,Patient,"Yes to go from this highly intelligent loving warm person that everyone in the family loved to this vulgar. Better. it's just someone I don't recognize. And, and you know for the longest time you know my brother and I. Would you know, be the the one says she'd be always willing to talk to, but she hasn't taken my call since I don't know summer 2020. By she just stopped you know so. yeah things went from bad to worse and that was God and I felt such guilt, because I was the one who proposed. hey oh you got painting let's try. And it causes this this irreversible. Just. whirlwind of an experience that's you know still present on. Today, so my my oldest brother. still goes out and checks on her shoes she's living down in victorville she settled with the. Workers COMP insurance company and had a big payout and bought a house and everything so and that that sounds great, but it also kind of like made it worse that she's she's this unpredictable personality, with all this money. For um you know strangers taken advantage and her her. You know, being generous and. it's just it's just a mess well yeah 2017 2018 I was heavily depressed and and also lot of suicidal ideation um you know the. that's another thing that's been hard is. it's hard to go through that and I go through it a lot. i'm suicidal and are classified as suicidal ideation you know the thought of any my life, the effect on people um the pros and the cons type thing, but the planning. The planning has only ever happened one time, and that was the end of 2020. You know."
405.0,Provider,I should try to kill yourself. Or is it just the planning with the closest you got.
9051.0,Patient,"The planning of. Where I cut out all communication right, you know, a month before I got too bright heart. That was the only time I got to the planning stage where it's like. I knew this was going to happen, I wanted it to happen, I looked forward to it like. There was a there was a calmness of it like, finally, the show's over like I don't have to do all the stuff that has me worried all the anxiety. I don't have to deal with it anymore almost like almost like the news or somebody went in a lottery like oh my God money stresses me out finally a million bucks is on the way it arrives Monday that's what the suicide felt like it felt. A upcoming. Release and solution to all the problems I was dealing with wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore um you know that was back then. But the suicidal. ideation the just a suicidal thoughts like that stuff comes. it's almost like a weekly thing it pops up for just a little bit every like any type of frustrating trigger setbacks like man shit you know, like. And, like the times and then like it a go but. Like I said to Julie, because you know julie's been very worried and write yourself as both as a professional and as a as a person, and about my. interest and a willingness to go through with that and I was saying, you know I haven't planned it, since you know. The end of 2020 you know i'm not i'm not they're planning, but you know does just a thought. come across my mind and it's like yeah and and outside looking in I think the the suicidal ideation as bizarre as it may sound, is kind of like a. A commune escape you know almost like someone sitting around and fantasizing about like like the winning the lottery thing you know oh. yeah it'd be so nice if I could do this thing that would be the you know definitely relief from all the stress on feeling and I think that's why I. Have the habit of that being a part of my like weekly cycle of emotions and and. Things that come across my son my mind in a given week."
405.0,Provider,"James. i'm glad to hear that other to reflect on on your mind and your reflect on what like what's the function of those thoughts and like you're saying, then in those moments when those emotions are very tense that. fleetingly thinking Oh, I could kill myself that there's a sense of choice and like you said it could be a relief and you don't necessarily have intention to follow through is just. That That gives you that sense of relief in those moments, and then do you do anything else, like is there is there some kind of either something you can do or other types of activities, you can do that could change your mind from both if you needed to."
9051.0,Patient,"yeah so. So one thing that. I rely heavily on to. pull me into a mood or pull me out of a mood music I am. Probably one of the most diverse appreciators of music you'll ever come across. I mean from pink floyd to nirvana to. Barry white to Jose Jose I mean. My my my appreciation of. my appreciation of music is probably the one thing, in my life that I could talk about non stop like there is no end to talking about how great music is and how great an artist is and it's their impact. In their genre and other genres like it's music is such a fascinating. Faster fascinating thing. um you know, one of one of the joys of life itself is just the ability to enjoy so much music and then. me taking the the dive into spotify six years ago, and having access to all the music in existence essentially. has been a real joy so. music is something. Where I could you know be feeling low and i'm like. i'm sitting in too much silence that's another thing i've noticed about myself and i've heard other neuro divergent for information is like. You know there's there's two modes like I want absolute silence and then I want no silence, you know, like the. I need something playing in the background, I need the white noise of a movie playing that i'm not paying attention, but I appreciate it being on and me, being able to hear it, while i'm actually focused on another thing it's it sounds so bizarre but it sounds so i'm. A valid, at the same time, you know when I when I have these interactions and because i'm like oh my God, I do that too, like, I never noticed I needed. background noise to. You know. To to focus it would it would you would logically speaking, you would want no distractions while you're trying to focus on the thing, but then having. A movie playing that you're not paying attention to actually helps you focus on, you know, the thing you're trying to read or study or whatever. So yeah music is a great escape I have many video games, but surprisingly I don't turn on my playstation that often asked one apologize about the message my room I. there's there's so many things that annoy me about my brain and that I can't do see before I do A and B. For example, oh I have all these boxes well. Like on the left here in the frame um you know they're just empty boxes from stuff i've ordered from Amazon, all I have to do is take a razor to them flatten them and take him downstairs and they're done it's like Oh well, yeah i'll do that but. When I you know focus on this other thing for store, you know, like I. there's so many things that that hang me up and it builds up and builds up you know, like a. starts to snowball, as the saying goes, um so yeah i'm trying to. be aware of that and get out of that process of. Wanting everything to flow in a perfect workflow to achieve it. So yeah."
405.0,Provider,This is helpful for me to know James in your awareness of. Your experience and awareness of how you're presenting yourself now in terms of your frame. So it and i'm sure that you've heard about suicide safety plans before identifying triggers sounds like when you might get pretty significant anxiety or worry that might bring on the suicidal thoughts and then. Are there other triggers that might bring those thoughts up for you.
9051.0,Patient,"loneliness. You know. I walked away from my. almost nine year relationship January 5 2016 and I ended the relationship was she was still living with me all the way until October of 2016 and. I loved her I loved her, but we weren't right for each other, you know the analogy, I use is you know she was very much. An apple and I was orange and you know, while we. While I remained optimistic like that there was just no growth, you know she never would admit she had stuff she needed to work on she also and in retrospect of me, looking at her really our relationship at her personality ADHD as well 100%. But I, like my mom I never got to tell her that because we're no longer. In touch but. yeah and that's that's such a frustrating thing with me. Something i've tried to understand about myself and it it Evidence seems to point back to it's part of my neuro divergent trait. or set of traits in that. I sabotage a relationship in my head in advance, in other words, you know, during the time I was a lyft driver. I got to know the bay area extremely well, I thought I knew the barrier, no, no, you you drive around the bay area full time as a driver you end up coming across towns you've never heard of. Or you or you know you've heard of a town, but there's a town next to you never heard of. So I bring it up to say i've met so many you know cute faces, you know at at various peet's coffee starbucks throughout the bay area and. and especially like. In a given week or month I frequent the same spots again and again like oh i'm back out in a render let me go to that starbucks or teach you know that i've been to before all i'm up in Marin. You know, let me go to the peet's coffee and green bright Green Berets a city i've never heard of it 20 years prior to lift driving and all of a sudden, not only have I heard of it i've been there, you know 17 times. um. So yeah. I would see all the obvious signs of and I don't I don't want to portray some weird ego thing of everywhere, I want every woman wasn't level me know, but there were a number of women in a given week that would show. The blushing the flirting the the interest you know all the sides all the. All of the you know body language and nonverbal expressions that they were interested and i've had so many that and i'm not i'm a people person I love talking to people, especially. You know, women. But I will say to myself, you know coming out of the coffee shops in my car like wow there goes, you know Ashley or whatever and. And like she lights up whenever I come in, like I I observe her with the five customers are front of me and and when i'm present share her whole demeanor lights up. changes and lights up so Ashley likes me. which you know what i'm driving full time and I can't it wouldn't be fair to her for me to it started really in a so these I go through this every time. I talked myself, out of a relationship oh yeah she likes me, but my finances aren't where they should be. i'm also trying to become a software engineer, you know when I become a software engineer i'll be making you know, a six figure income and I have to take care of my debt and then it'd be the right time, you know, like so this the cycle. Just just kept repeating itself um. And then before. Excuse me, before lift driving you know most before was my my ex still been in my life I haven't heard from her since new year's eve of 2016 so the end of 2016. and Then all of a sudden, you know months later i'm a lyft driver and i'm seeing all these these wonderful places and faces. and So you know I stopped lift drive and i'm sad i'm sad because. One i'm no longer mobile I was relying on the on a rental car program to do the lift driving and. Like I regret not taking the the leap of faith and taking a chance to actually see what would happen if I got her number or got her number and actually set up a first date um you know any of the various woman. So. yeah triggers. To after. Six years of having I deleted my instagram a few weeks ago, you know it was during my feeling low nothing's working out screw the world screw my life phase, but even now, even now, with me film are optimistic. I still. I don't want it, because you know scrolling instagram you see all these these these beautiful women, and I know they they go through much preparation to portray a certain lifestyle and a. projection of happiness and and and whatnot but. You know even even just the the couples that you know I followed like fitness couples by just seeing that i'm like damn it, you know i'm overweight i'm unemployed on this on that. And then like to see a happy couple it just like i'm happy for them, but then it reminds me of how unhappy I am how lonely I am how long i've been single. And then, how many times, I had the chance to not be single or at least pursue not being single and totally botched you know that that opportunity. So yeah though that's that's another trigger that that gets me down. As well as our you know i've told you all about physical encounters local encounters there's also been a number of attempts to have and maintain a long distance relationship, you know women that i've met on Twitter. And those all just ended in in in tragedy of of not becoming real due to well. coven. But, as well as you know, lack of income to be able to travel and actually go. visit you know them in person and see if how we feel. Across digital interactions matches what it's like actually in person. Right oh yeah that i'm."
405.0,Provider,"Always on you, James what, what is your source of income, since you haven't been working out."
9051.0,Patient,"So I had unemployment. With. coming in, you know, through the state, but that ended in September. and I still have abt support for for groceries. And i've had a few jobs come in each month that. allowed me to get by so i've done. Like field technician work, you know. hey James we have a law firm in San Francisco their wife is not working, can you go check that out. And you know pays 45 an hour with to our minimum guarantee So if I fixed issue 15 minute I still get $45 times to. So i've had jobs, like that that have allowed me to hang on as well as borrowing lots and lots of money from from a close friend. A very patient close friend. But uh yeah that's that's what allowed me to get by but. You know, I have a I have two roommates one is my childhood best friend and his wife, who live in the second bedroom and then my nephew he lives out in the living room of space. So the two of them cover you know pretty much 80% of the rent. And you know, one of them is moving out in two weeks, and so i'm looking at February with grades, you know. eyebrows raised, and you know. little bit wary of what's going to happen. And again, it leads back to like. damn it I have i've got people i've got you know Twitter Twitter COM contacts, you know, beyond the ADHD and beverage community. On my. Twitter account, I have people who work at Microsoft and dropbox airbnb Facebook Google whatever. That are hiring managers and that do put out, you know hey you know we're hiring you know, do you know anybody look before a remote role in so bad, just like with encountering various individuals, while lift driving. I want to reach out and say yeah. I am, you know, obviously I want to apply it to these jobs but I don't have the skills. Because I don't have the focus to complete the courses that will provide those skills. So yeah."
405.0,Provider,James What if you apply to jobs for which you already have the skill.
9051.0,Patient,"The jobs actually very good question and i'm sorry and i've asked myself this many times um. there's so many jobs where I have. 70% of the qualifications and I get so much anxiety of the 30% that I don't know. um and it removes. Whatever confidence that I had away from even trying to pursue. applying for a job. You know there's. Just so many things. I keep getting stuck in the cycle like I look at a job and say oh Okay, I know 70% of that 30% um you know what I can learn that, in a weekend and I technically could, if I could focus, because the courses are there, I have the ability to. set up a virtual environment emulate you know the type of setup that they're that they're asking for you know you can virtualize all that stuff and. and learn all that stuff if you could focus, you know for the eight hours on Saturday eight hours on Sunday yeah you can be brought up to speed and show competence during an interview. And I get caught in that every time every time I see a job interview or job. listing. i'm like. You know it's it's it's become 5050 there's there's like 50% optimism and 50% oh no let me just let me just not apply at all. yeah I mean the this coming across this uh this field technician work back in June is when it started has been great because it's boosted my confidence that. That quote unquote I still got it. But it's also the type of work i've been doing, you know troubleshooting wi fi installing up. Sorry dogs have a tendency to like lay as close as they can to me and I have like a girl. So yeah it's. it's you know, setting up. installing a new router or switch like that stuff is great, but a full time job doing that, at a company it's it's not. um. it's not the pay that i'm assuming if i'm honest it's not the paid that i'm looking for it's not the pay that is going to allow me to. Be on my own and pay all of the rain and catch up on my bills and negotiate with the franchise tax board and irs about all the unpaid taxes doing my lift years because. I wasn't thinking about taxes back then and now it's all kind of slowly trickling in as as something I need to focus on in 2022. So, like yeah that's that's another trigger you know financial obligations. And worries and what will the future bring And what if I fail and oh no What if I don't succeed at all well then, if I don't see it succeed. Then, that means i'm going to lose my apartment, then that means i'm going to be homeless and and and becoming. homeless and having know where to go after surviving this law is like the ultimate failure point for me it's the ultimate anxiety anything regarding the inability to pay rent and eviction and it's it's a it's a it's a shame and and fate too severe for me to to to to endorse, you know. That that's how I feel about it at least."
405.0,Provider,Now I can't imagine how overwhelming and unbearable that would be sure.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah and and I think about I see people all the time that oh yeah I lost my place had to you know move in or you know move out in a slight for me i'm i'm fortunate in the fact that are in the in the way that you know i've been in this apartment this year to be 12 years. And the end of the year to be 12 years 11 years i've been in this apartment. And you know this apart my rent is less than 1600 dollars a month, if I were a new tenant living in this two bedroom i'd be paying over 3000 easily easily. You know, with modern day a rental rates so and that's another thing like. Oh damn like I had an apartment I had an affordable apartment and it's beautiful neighborhood i'm a block away from the water and I failed I lost it I couldn't keep up you know with her, and so this Dessau keeps time back to I must succeed, I must succeed, I."
405.0,Provider,must get control of.
9051.0,Patient,My my you know neurological ports that are getting in the way of me having success.
405.0,Provider,i'm understand.
9051.0,Patient,So so yeah it's that's.
405.0,Provider,"All right, appreciate your candor James and I can I can sense the suffering and I know you desperately want better for yourself and you're trying to figure out how to how to take those steps to get there, so I applaud you advocate yourself."
9051.0,Patient,Thank you.
405.0,Provider,"i'll ask a few questions, just to make sure i'm not missing anything and in terms of the suicide risk assessment you identified a few triggers. And the music might be something that helps you to take your your yourself, out of a particular mindset. With even either petting your dogs and are taking the dog for a walk be something else I can help you even go down walk down to the water different ways to be able to just take yourself out of the situation that mindset."
9051.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it it. It. Sorry i'm Choosing the right way to to to say what i'm thinking and feeling um. It doesn't. I feel like it's it's perfectly balanced meaning it doesn't take much to put me in to that bad place and it doesn't take much to bring me out. Of that bad place um you know. You know, playing something on spotify or bringing up a YouTube video. That you know or somebody sends me a link and it's something you know funny or or I receive a message for somebody I haven't talked to and then they're asking about something and it's and it's starting to ignite positive. thought processes are you know they asked for my help with something that's another behavior about me is i'm always I give 100% to help someone else like a such a great feeling to be reliable and come through for someone you know. You know hey Can you help me, I mean i'll pre pandemic he helped me move in I was always the person people Paul to be a driver because I had a job, where I drove big trucks, so I was always like the better person I had maneuvering the big U haul vehicles. or. Someone calls me up hey my computer is having issues um Can you help me and it's like sure, and you know, look at their computer like Okay, this is hard drives failing will need to pick up a new one. You know, we can go to central computer so San Francisco to get a same day, or we can order on Amazon and it'd be here, you know next day or the day after. And they make their choice, and you know computers fixed and are so happy and you know, like that feeling of like Oh, why I was the hero i'm i'm i'm i'm good at something i'm worthy i'm a. I made a positive impact in somebody's life and these These are all things that helped me. To kind of to kind of restore me into a more optimistic positive. look towards the future, even if it's a repeat like. Fixing people's computers i've been doing this crap for since I was a teenager like it's it's what people know me for and part of me. kind of hate to like I don't want to be the go to guy anymore um but also you know, like when someone really needs it, and you know able to come through for them like I can't deny like. i'm appreciative that I actually could be there for them that they didn't have to go spend 500 bucks at a best buy you know, to have a bunch of extra services and things added you know, taking advantage."
405.0,Provider,"Right sure that's fair James area again give me a sense of the kind of person, you are, and I did that it helped me to better understand up. In a few minutes we'll play some ideas about my understanding of you, and then how that could relate to treatment like you said, there are a few different kind of. strategies that can be helpful to kind of get you back out of the mind that when the thoughts about suicide come into your mind like you said it. can be easy to get that thoughts were easy to come out of it anyway, but then you've probably been explained one 800 273 talk at the national crisis line should you need it. or virtual clinically of crisis team that's available, should you need done and then there's the different circumstances where you might have those thoughts that you like you said might come. up every week into your mind quickly out of your mind quickly I described it as a chronic pattern of suicidal ideation when emotionally distressed. And that could be different than maybe when, but what you felt two weeks ago, and definitely what you felt a year ago. When you shut off or communication and you're actively planning where if you're not you starting to think you can intend to act on those thoughts are starting to plan that would be a different level of risk. And that would be maybe when you'd have to reach out to somebody and if you don't trust yourself, maybe go to an emergency room for a mental health assessment. So I say that because it's just like risk stratification so it's a different types of interventions, depending on the risks that are President. That makes them. Good luck, a few more questions. something you struggle with definitely periods of severe depression that emit may have you had the opposite manic symptoms feeling unusually. Energetic for days, weeks in a row, people were clearly noticing, this is different than your usual you're talking faster than normal you were more impulsive more sexual than usual. Drinking or drugging and you usually not are your mood is unusually happy for no reason to do have you experienced discrete periods like that are different than your usual sentence so."
9051.0,Patient,"Now that that sounds intriguing and scary. all at once, like um I mean it would be a change like to have to have you know back to back. Endless energy for days and days. No and i've heard people talk about you know manic manic episodes or whatnot um. No, I I. You know when when the closest I get to that as when i'm having a week where everything is just going well you know, good news, followed by good news, you know i'm in a happy mood and it's like. You know I noticed when I was working and had regular income, you know even even when Amazon, and I said, like that, because, like. It was terrible you know, like the the the physical. demand of that job it's it's unlike anything i've ever done, you know and i've worked at fedex before Amazon is just you know, a whole nother level but. At the end of that struggle being paid every week every Friday i'm that feeling was great that feeling was you know employment has always provided a. A good. Infrastructure, if you will, for for for stable mental health. is the best way to say it. Thank you, and you know for for me. And I noticed, you know some of my lowest times, or when I am unemployed non filling. Less worth you know I like in and something i've said many times to friends like this pandemic, would be completely different if January 2 came and i'm unemployed. But there's you know $260,000 in my bank account and i'm just looking for things to do, every day to stay bored but zero worry about income and money that will be a completely different last you know 24 months of this. But you know worrying about ran and you know the you know the eviction notices and 2020 and and and just. You know the whole like. yeah yeah that that to see a letter hard to see a letter about background, you know throughout the years incredible. anxiety incredible worry and. The fact that i'm still in this apartment is such a blessing. You know I am I do pray and I very thankful, you know God has gotten me this far. yeah um. yeah so income, you know it circles back to my core goal of. Of. Getting a hold of my mental health getting a hold of my inability to complete a goal or a task, especially surrounding that which leads to a job, it seems. To me, to me it seems like the only path forward, meaning the proper solution to so much of what is stressing me out his. um his income, you know income doesn't doesn't solve the loneliness of not having a companion in my life which I so desperately you know what um. But it's a starting point, you know because, like Okay, I have, I have income Okay, let me order the shelves and stuff that are sitting on my Amazon cart and start to organize my room, you know. I have income, so I can. You know, for everything that I look around and say you know what Ikea dresser would be nice well great I have income now I can I can make those things. happen so it's it's all very. A lot logical to me of. That being something that's so. that's a. You know Swiss army knife for taking care of so much of what bothers me right now."
405.0,Provider,"I understand yeah I think you're what you're saying things make sense, there are. There are certain basic needs and basic needs, like need the income to make sure that you have a roof over your head food and then that helps you to be able to build towards. Maybe you're more comfortable with relationships and then potentially setting yourself up for more future stability in terms of financial related housing and so. So I certainly understand what you're saying that does make sense and and just make sure i'm not missing anything I know you described with your mother, with the thinking that she developed with schizophrenia, have you ever experienced hallucinations and delusions yourself at any point."
9051.0,Patient,"No i'm, the only thing that i've experienced that I found this are. Are and it's maybe happen that i'm aware of probably three times in the last 20 years where i've had dreams that we're so. immersed immersive so real that they kind of emerged into my. Conscious memories as actual memory versus a dream. Like I remember. 20 years ago I there's just this time period where I had a bunch of dreams and then I would ask. I would you know be talking to a friend of mine, and I will say something like hey What about the. End he's like wait, what are you talking about I was like oh nothing but, in my head i'm like oh crap that did happen, I was actually in the dream so luckily, that was not a lasting thing, but I thought it was so bizarre. That that you know, because my I have such a. vivid imagination and my dreams oh my God my dreams are. I am in all and and also terrified of them have my subconscious. Mind like you wake up you're like Why did I dreamed that like. Probably make a hell of a movie script but. wow like why. Why, why did you present that to me brain like I don't understand it and i'm glad that that was not a reality and, I dare not other back what happened in a dream to anybody. Just because it's so weird that I that I, you know experienced it. and industries where it's like oh wow that was pretty cool or. i'm i'm impressed by all the way this you know the dream and went. almost as if i'm hiring somebody else's creative in your work and I, and I have to step back, like wow no that was actually need you know not not not the me that's you know i'm used to during the day and those regular flow of thoughts, but."
405.0,Provider,The.
9051.0,Patient,You know dream dream machine version of me. i'm.
405.0,Provider,Very well during sound like.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so uh. yeah it was there was a very trippy thing to. To have my dreams. kind of leave their container and then. You know form and memory and my my regular set of memories. Leaving leaving me to believe that was actually a reality, when in fact it was you know just some isolated thing inside my head during my sleep. So yeah I luckily have not. Had have that that happened. You know the The thing that that trips me out as far as things I was not aware of i'm. less so, you know. Psychological neurologically speaking, but the the sleep apnea I had no idea that I was showing that behavior until my. Ex girlfriend. mentioned it like oh you stop breathing you're sleeping you scared me and like I mentioned it to the nurse and the nurse said, you should mention it to the doctor. And I mentioned it to the doctor and she was like yeah let's let's go ahead and get to sleep test, this is like 2015 2016 and. You know I brought the little kit home with the wristwatch thing and the. sensor for your fingertip that you put on and. I initially fell asleep without it on, and then I woke up and use the bathroom and then remember, to put it on so I only had it on for another three and a half hours. Before I started my day and But even with that the data, you know showed that in those three and a half hours of me wearing a device my brain had to reset my breathing 51 times you know so yeah I absolutely. Had have sleep apnea but my insurance didn't pay for the machine at the time, so what's in motion as of last week, in addition to the success of. You and I have in this meeting and and and and which I was very much looking forward to you know optimism that you know you wouldn't be able to provide inside and help me. was also tackling getting the sleep apnea under control so February 1 i'll be able to have a use my new provider to schedule, you know some sort of a sleep test and hopefully my insurance covers it this time around. I can, I can I pause for about two minutes just gonna run to the restaurant. you're right back."
405.0,Provider,15 minutes.
9051.0,Patient,Okay cool.
405.0,Provider,"Jews, you have any other medical problems that you've been diagnosed under you're currently receiving treatment."
9051.0,Patient,"I have a hydrogen titus sephora tivo, which is a skin condition, where I basically get chronic abscesses started happening, when I was 15 and, unfortunately. still happens with my new provider i'm hoping to see a dermatologist I can help me. Take that in a different direction. The provider, that I was at in. Oh, it was it June, so you know going to the er, for you know leg pain or. needing help you know with an abscess. What test all the blood tests. That i've ever had done since forever, you know for years and years and years i've always come back with flying colors and in June of. The blood tests that uh I had. came back with just a minimum qualifications or qualifiers. For pre diabetes so. yeah I. Have that to worry about I mean you know it's it's fixable reversible something that can be improved, but yeah first time that's ever popped up on the radar."
405.0,Provider,"James, what do you how do you feel about your body your shape your way."
9051.0,Patient,"I take pride in the fact that. i'm or rather i'm appreciative of the fact that i'm tall, because no one ever believes on 424 to 40 pounds I think i'm like 300 just because I guess my height, you know, I quote, unquote wear it well um. But yeah that that that's The thing that that that heavily bothers me, you know, no matter how many attractive woman show interest like you know I need to see. that's probably another thing baked into the talking myself out of stuff is actually not probably I know it is it's a reason of you know, oh my money's not right i'm not in shape i'm not this i'm not there's some this. But yeah like I need to see myself. i'm attractive, you know physically and I I knew I could get there, you know with exercise and change in diet, but. it's so hard to change your diet, when you know. A proper diet is it. I don't I don't want to sound like i'm you know just pulling from a list of excuses, but you know it costs money to eat well and it costs a little money to eat terrible. So yeah it's that's another thing of if I can just get income, if I can just get if I can just get you know if I could just get my money right, I could you know, be at a gym you know i'm really hoping my first job I land is a remote, one which gives me the flexibility to. You know, be home exercise go for walks not worry about commuting just commuting takes up so much time out of your day to get to work, get back home from work."
405.0,Provider,very disappointing. Do you ever. eat where you reach the point where it's a large volume you wind up feeling physically sick or feel the shame for how much you ate it after the experience so Benjamin.
9051.0,Patient,"Standard operating procedure for me I. know I always over eat it is rare. Where. I have to be distracted where i'm eating slow right don't normally finish you know the massive super burrito that i've you know bought at one of the various places like it brill's from. You know i'm known for eating double the amount of anybody else of my friends friend orders wonderful regular size varietal I order to you know, because that gives me the feeling of being full and and and. Satisfying you know my hunger. In the rare situations where. I. consciously try not to overeat so you know, a drink a ton of water before the mill to prevent myself from being able to take in so much food. um you know tho those are rare, but you know it's it's a good, you know filling that okay I didn't you know. eat as much lately I can't eat as much for the last week, you know i've been feeling pretty crappy without coffee and whatnot and i've had a loss of a of appetite. In with that um. I have what I refer to as a sneaky mood changes, where i'm feeling terrible and I look back at my log I keep a text log of key activities, such as when I woke up when I last walk the dogs. When I when I last brewed a cup of tea, because you know time blindness, you know I. Will you know brew coffee or make a cup of tea. This 27 ounce bag and. it'd be sitting here and then all of a sudden it's cold and I, and I looked at the the my log and i'm like oh crap that was two hours ago I made that like I totally got lost in whatever was I was doing. So i'm. Looking at the my my texts log and it's just a text file and you know I use a. I have a I have a configured to where I press the key and it automatically inserts to current date and time though I press the key type, whatever the notice and i'm done i'm. i'll look at that and say oh my God it's fits seven hours, since our last date it didn't feel like that, so that that helps me to keep track of like okay it's been seven hours you're spending nine hours, since I last date and I noticed i'm in a bad mood like oh i'm hungry, you know. I mean usually, when my on my. Whatever he tells me that you know what whatever aspect of my brain tells me that i'm hungry it's like Okay, I feel it my stomach hurts I need to eat something, but for the last week i've had this. This a loss of appetite or inability to know that I need to eat and I that log comes in handy with like Okay, you should I don't even feel hungry, but I know I haven't eaten in nine hours, so let me eat something and food, food is a. Such a great you know it's the gift in the curse food it food there's so much great tasting food in the Bay area I love food. But also. overdoing it with food and then also going without food for too long, greatly affects my mood. So yeah."
405.0,Provider,yeah those are various functions. And do the shipping topic left main area will cover you mentioned you dabble with marijuana typically do you drink alcohol to use anything else I cocaine and enemy harrowing pills off the streets anything like that.
9051.0,Patient,"No those things, honestly, they they scare me. The Ecstasy the cocaine I. i've never even outside of movies i've never even seen cocaine like I remember, I had. I had this lift passenger and she was talking about a wild weekend she had, and I was like. A i'd asked her like i've never even seen cocaine like what is it what is it, I know that looks like but does it have an older to whatever smell she's like. yeah it smells like dirty chalk and I was like wow what you know it was fascinating to me to to to get that perspective and and and whatnot I say all that to say no i'm i'm a i'm a plain Jane when it comes to that alcohol. Pre endemic pre coven. I would have you know, a beer every every month, you know meeting up or friends to go to a movie but i've never had a. Need for it, you know I got a bottle of vodka on open, you know kirkland brand that's been on my kitchen since December 2016 I bought a bunch of alcohol, you know, to celebrate new years alone, and all I got to was like a bottle of wine, so I had like this vodka that's untouched. I bought some jack Daniels two years ago, I was had a really terrible headache and like so I bought it with the with the intention of getting drunk to. You know. You know substitute you know medicine like Oh, I feel terrible, at least if i'm drunk I should you know feel better, but I hate whiskey so like that bottle is still 75% full after two years. I say all these things to let you know of my relationship with alcohol I love craft beer i'm when I have it, but I don't. I never have a need for alcohol i've never find myself yearning for if i'm out eating tacos at a place, and they have some you know good craft beer or corona or something yeah it's great it goes with the mood the vibe. i've never been drunk before i've been tipsy but i've never been drunk i've never. You know vomiting or blacked out like I don't like I don't like losing control of myself like that. makes no sense to me why people do."
405.0,Provider,"That helps me. Very appreciate your taking the time to take an additional almost hour, so that you can talk to me, I can better understand you and."
9051.0,Patient,Oh no I highly appreciate. You being the one to take the extra time.
405.0,Provider,"you're welcome Jim so i'll share my preliminary impressions and then we can talk about what that means, and so. Though you're thoughtful you're a caring person you curious, you have a strong imagination, these are all very profound strengths and then I think that's. One way to think about how to be helpful, is to think about the biological domain, the psychological the social the spiritual religious and. believe your belief in God is also important to you as well, and so to the extent that you can whether it's. In your own way or attending church or, however, that you can tap into that that's certainly important from the Biological and there's the research that you've done, I do agree that you meet criteria for ADHD you have been diagnosed with for. The one from the biological so ADHD, as you know, people are born with that and then, and so it is important to treat that what what I would say or. confounding variables is the actual to sleep apnea you i'm not sure, to the extent you read about the psychiatric effects of sleep apnea that untreated sleep apnea. But untreated sleep apnea makes depression much harder to treat and makes ADHD much harder to treat so I say that because it's been unfortunate that you're unsure wouldn't. cover it because it's so important, not just for your physical health, which is you know with the treatment of a sick napkins are important. For the sleep apnea as well as your cardiac risk factors your blood pressure is also actually essential for the depression, as well as the ADHD treatment so. i'm glad that ELISE every first you'll be able to see somebody else and could potentially set you up with that, so I say that that. is going to be so essential for you to be able to get the treatment, hopefully, your PCP will be a very strong advocate for you in order to to. Get that the actual appropriate treatment, so that the sleep apnea will be essential, the tree that's making your ADHD even with a wellbutrin Ritalin and adderall. concert out it's it's hard to know to what extent those would be helpful if I know the Admiral you experienced that kind of panicky experience. But, to the extent that the riddle in the concert of would those be helpful if the stick up he was treated I don't know. but either way that's that's a that's a factor, I would say, also the patterns of between not eating enough and then bit the eating too much that certainly impacts mood as you're aware and then that also impacts just. The general regulation of emotional experience anyway, you actually meet criteria for what called binge eating disorder, which is a recurring pattern of people who. Binge, to the point where they eat too much clearly more than other people that are around it's bothersome tried, I tried to do different strategies to mitigate the actual bingeing experience. And then oftentimes is people under eating at some point during the day, and you too much so it's not like regular structured. Periods of eating, so I think that that's also a factor and then again that that's from the biological it's also psychological as well just in terms of the biological so many impacts your mood. And then that will impact the management of depression, the sleep apnea impacting the depression untreated sleep apnea impacting the depression and the ADHD from the psychological there's there's a. lot of what you've described the struggles with your self worth I think you're a very caring guy I think you're also struggle with your self worth. And there's a self defeating like you use the word sabotaging that that is a self sacrificing pattern within you where you'll go 100% for your friends to help them. In your mind, though, that you can't channel that hundred percent energy for yourself like you said. Maybe there's a 70% chance you're confident in your competence in a particular job 30% you're not maybe with a woman you're not very confident in yourself, so you said you won't kind of that you won't take that. I think we were maybe like the risk, or at least I think you use the word leave you want to take that leap to take that chance to yourself at risk for yourself like. Now there's no certainty that job will work out the way you'd expect or the, however, that conversation goes with that woman. Nonetheless, though, that your your your your sacrifice your in the and not maybe take the chance for yourself work related relationship related whereas you'd be willing to go above and beyond, for your friends and I know that the huge source of. gratification when you do help someone out which makes them there's also an element where something hold you back from you. channeling that same energy for yourself, and I think that's the struggles, with the self worth within you and I. Imagine there's a factor with me, I know your father your biological Father left or so early and it was minimally involved in your life. And then, with your stepfather you use the word of the ceiling so misunderstood because that's exactly it over thinking that. someone like you said someone's telling you started off the thing this is how you feel course as a recipient you feel misunderstood in that and that impacts, where you feel you are who you think you are someone else's do it totally dismissing. Any inner experience of yours and so that's totally impact self worth I imagine there's also the relationship which i'll be probably in some of those interactions with people with ADHD described where. Even that first tweet that you read about the loser that's true you're in about the loser tweet in reference to the ADHD that. Without you knowing what's happening all the people identifying that you try your hardest and then you just can't see them you feel like I keep failing I keep failing. That impacts your sense of self worth so it's hard for you to it's hard from a like a brain based position of the execution the steps to execute it. I think, also for you, that the sleep apnea probably makes this motivation and energy that much harder as well, so I think that adds a layer to it. And then the self worth perspective is that showing with that shame that. i'm so worried that i'm going to fail or take a chance for a woman after that you need these sets of condition in order for you to feel confident in yourself like. Oh, I need this money in order to make sure that I can get this kind of jobs, so, then I can exercise this way like. it's kind of like you need to protect yourself, by creating the set the correct condition. In order for you to feel comfortable, whereas, as you know, you're gonna have to take a lot of risks on yourself that. You could start walking your dog down to the water a few times a day or two dogs to the water a few times a day I mean walking twice a day. Maybe start to do longer walks maybe regularly more frequently and i'm just saying when example it's just to challenge yourself that. there's a sense of festivity that a few things fall into place then then i'll feel better when it's the work of you taking the chance to yourself you'll end up feeling better it's hard or not i'm not dismissing how hard it is. Saying that it is hard and that's what makes it worth it for you and had, how do you find that within yourself to to find the motivation. And I understand that the challenge of how do you execute it, how do you organize yourself to do it, and then I think there's also these. These are the steps of you figure out a way to essentially push through it to the extent that you're able to. Some of the tasks that are more cognitively complex like running a software engineer program I think that'd be harder in terms of degree than, say walking the dog dogs more in order to feel like you're. Moving more in order to feel healthier, for example, so that's another element, and then I think the loneliness that you described and that that relates to the self worth and then related the the social element in terms of. You sounds like you enjoy friends, you have connected with people in terms of the person you're living with a childhood friend, so you have. Strong relationships and and you value relationships and then, at the same time that a lot of Canada, so the pandemic has made a lot of life disrupted in many ways, nonetheless, so that. I think that you, you have struggle with with being really able to feel like you can be yourself with people in different settings and so I say that because, in terms of what long before getting into treatments, what are your reactions to my impressions."
9051.0,Patient,"I think. I fully agree. With with everything that you said. very insightful, in particular where you said. If I remember right, you know, putting putting protections you know in place. And you know that that really speaks to me that's definitely something I could say i've done. Many times you know, to put to. put up some sort of a. A. wall or barrier that limits. How devastating. an outcome could be should it go in that direction, you know almost like someone wearing a. plane of Armor you know bullet is um it's like I don't want to get shot, but should I get shot at least I won't it's gonna hurt, but I will die. it's gonna it's going to absorb. Most of the damage that allow me to get through this. and i'm um you know I think I I I do that with. A lot of things, I mean for for me it's it's it's quite logical, I mean I, I want to survive um. Any situation that that doesn't go. The way I plan it to whether that's an emotional one a. Physical one you know i'm. Like i've never been out on the ocean before, but you know to wear life fest should I go overboard at least wearing this thing that will help me to survive. So yeah. yeah I. often feel. All, although I I feel alone i'm competent and forming the plans. One of the things that gets me and I, and I see many, many a. neuro divergent brain say the same thing is trying to find my start um it's like a wake up, have a plan for the day. The funny thing i've learned about ADHD is you know. You you only struggle with things that you're not interested in doing and funny enough I struggle with things I am interested in doing you know. waking up and saying okay I caught that that video game on sale for 10 bucks that i've been wanting to play i've bought it i've downloaded it it's ready to play, but I end up not getting to it because. I wouldn't allow myself to start it because of. Something sidetracked me or or guilt or. I realized that. I let something slipped in my hands how supposed to take care of and and so now starts the the the cycle of. dread I failed i've messed up um. yeah. man. Lawson yeah."
405.0,Provider,"That is. No longer so you're saying, because I appreciate you sharing that because it helps me to again better understand you and I think that's certainly relates to what what. What i'm saying in terms of my impressions and how that is just a reflection of your experience and that they can terms of the. The psychotherapy piece, I think you and Julie can certainly work on a lot of the. The guilt, the feeling like a failure, the hearing that if you were to really invest yourself try something that you could end up it'd be too devastating if you were to try hard and fail, so you protect yourself, because at least. That, even though it's it's not optimal its protective in the sense of you imagine it would be more devastating if you were to try and then sale so. I understand, so it needs to the extent that Julie can work with you on your self worth on your emotional regulation and I think that can certainly. Self compassion, I think, would be very important for you what I mean, I think, certainly trying by Vance which would be a next reasonable step, I can communicate that with plenty of coming soon. God might have mentioned, it is a person she's thinking about starting with next what I would recommend to. communicate that to tanya and Julie as well that the pharmacogenetics testing so that's the testing looking at the enzymes in your liver their steps between the enzymes that are that are in your liver and then how those those genes are expressed in the impact on the medication. To the extent that you tried various medications you haven't had much of a response, I think, in your case it's. Usually that's the indication for this test needed if someone's tried various medications multiple medication. You know didn't tolerate or to no avail it's worth seeking the genetic testing to see maybe based on your jeans and then the medication is there. Is there a medication that would just be a better fit for you it's not it's not a guarantee every helpful I think it's additional information that makes sense, I think vivek could certainly be started in the meantime. upon it could work with you on that this this. I think this pertains also to the antidepressants between Prozac and ssri wellbutrin and norepinephrine dopamine receptor taking ever you've taken both of those. You haven't found relief, so I think that's as pharmacogenetics testing could potentially aid with the identify potential identification having no. yeah that might be helpful as well."
9051.0,Patient,"And that's that's that's The funny thing about the. This is the Prozac the. fluoxetine Is that how you pronounce. Your crowd. So yeah with this. This was I hate to say like this, but this was my idea like i've voiced to Julie and the session before last, you know i've become frustrated with with the with kastner because. It just it just kind of felt like a. You know, minimum effort given minimum focus given. And the ssri the Prozac That was my idea like i'm feeling low all that sort of feeling like crap never taken out to the depressives in my life, I always thought they would you know, be more benefit than burden and. But, nonetheless, I was you know proposed it, you know, during our group meeting or, which is where we communicate in direct chat. You know medication needs like hey what should I should I be trying antidepressants sure we could try and do the precedence let's get you started on Prozac but, again, you know. First 10 milligrams 20 milligrams not 30 milligrams and I don't I don't see any any changes, am I still open to enter the person's absolutely. But it may need to be something else, and you know as Julie stated, you know there's a whole world of. variations and. options and stuff So yes, if there's if there's a new medication on that side of that thing on that side of things that you would like me to try i'm definitely open to it, you know I just I just want to find you know, one of the things people told me at the beginning of my. ADHD journey a realization is. You know there's there's so many different types of medications and you have to be patient and but, once you find your type once you find what actually pairs well works well with you it'd be life changing. So that's some that's a. that's advice that i've held on to end us optimism that i've held on to. So yeah five amps and whatever antidepressant that I should. Take next i'm all for it."
405.0,Provider,"yeah I appreciate your openness and you're right it's a frustrating process that. trial and error period and optimally, though, and preferably sooner rather than later, you find the medication that does work for you from the Ad side as well as from the mood. mood in a depressant something variety, as you know, so in terms of medicaid alternative ones, the Prozac is certainly a reasonable one wellbutrin. Reasonable reasonable together unfortunately hasn't been beneficial for you, particularly, and I think part of it is the untreated sleep apnea at the same time, I think, certainly coming off the Prozac. Just decreasing it. By 10 milligrams a day, so if you're going from the say 30 milligrams do that go to 20 milligrams a day should say for three days, and then you can. Then, if you have a silver maybe 10 milligram pills, you can do 10 milligrams a day for every three days, and then you can stop it, it has a very long half life so. you're showing notice. Maybe headache or knowledge or more worse things out of your sleep coming off it it, it should be okay coming off the Prozac. concerns. Are their options are medications like you might have read about effects or or cymbalta those modulates serotonin and norepinephrine those are reasonable next steps they could both elevate blood pressure, a little bit. They not like an emergency, but that blood pressure would need to be monitored. For those. The there's a depending on terms of the insurance there's some newer ones are not necessarily better that the trend Alex is a medication that might help some cognitive function, a little bit better than some of the other antidepressants. Above and beyond just helping to the depression. trend telex so that might be something to consider it's not going to help ADHD but it just the overall experience of your difficulty concentration that's contributed that is attributed to say depression or anxiety. You. Might alleviate some of that potentially better than some of the other end of depressing So these are these are reasonable ones i'll pass this information along to tanya well and then in terms of binge eating disorder. It for additional support just for for the eating patterns, as well as your mood, we do have an eating disorder iot intensive outpatient program it's virtual three days a week. Okay it's something to consider is it necessarily something you require right now. Not necessarily it's something where maybe you're trying some of these interventions and, if you would like additional support that might be something to consider again i'll pass this along to Julian. tanya to think about Okay, so it is a different options, just to offer you additional support and unfortunately I don't think that we have a dietician who could potentially meet with you outside of the program if if someone else pass it along i'll see if that can work out. Because that could be some just to meet with somebody who potentially can talk to you about your eating patterns and ways that you might adjust that could that could help. That it helps your mood your concentration anyway so again i'll pass that information along, but I think that there are certainly ways forward for you and in terms of pharmacogenetics testing. We are able to coordinate with one of the gene side, which is a company does that we were just know that we would essentially order it through them. They were mailed a kit to you, you would never get back to them, they were some the results to us. So relatively straightforward process and not cheek swab. is straightforward so and so again this this path forward for you, covering these different domain, I think you could certainly. receive the help it's just you know it's a to be patient with yourself during the process and I think reminding yourself I wish I could wave a magic wand and make you feel better. Now, unfortunately. There are there is it, it sounds reasonable James i'll pass this on to Julian and tanya as well."
