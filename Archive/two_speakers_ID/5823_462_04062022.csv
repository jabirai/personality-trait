462.0,Provider,"Thank you for using my mind, I always have to ask, and so I really appreciate it."
5823.0,Patient,No problem it's just my fiance's you're okay with that right.
462.0,Provider,"As long as you're okay with it yeah. Okay, all right well good so good memory, on the appointment, I know it's a while in between so nice job with that how has everything been going for you over the past few months."
5823.0,Patient,"i'm pretty good I guess um. My. daughter just moved home. On the first I just picked her up and. that's been kind of a whirlwind um. she's. She turned 18 on march 1 so since she's legally enter adult. She got a boyfriend that she met online. Through Facebook, one of the groups that she's on on Facebook. And he's 29. yeah and he lives in Colorado. And my daughter is very, very innocent like she's only had one other relationship. With a boy that was her age. right and it was a very innocent relationship. she's still a Virgin. she's never really experimented on that, and this boy or this guy is. bringing out all of those bad thing. She ended up. She had used my tablet one day because her phone broke. She logged in on our Facebook and other things, and she never logged out so when I noticed that she had never logged out I looked at it and I read it. I know I violated her privacy and her space. And I really didn't do it out of out of ignorance or hate or anything like that I did it because I was worried."
462.0,Provider,And absolutely.
5823.0,Patient,"The the school that she was in told me that I needed to tell her and to tell her how I felt mom so I did, and it was not good. For the next like 24 hours she was not herself, she was really depressed they also made me shut her phone off. And they told me to shut her phone off that they wanted to see how she would be. Without talking to the guy. She. Had accidentally. had to reset her phone, for some reason, so when she went to try to log back into everything she couldn't because she didn't have the wi fi password for the school and. The school wouldn't give it to her, because they wanted her not to talk to the guy so before I shut her phone off this happens and. When they wouldn't give it to her, she went to her therapists office, and she flipped out she broke the it's like a kitchen table that they had we had the meetings. And she literally the legs off of it took one of the legs and broke the two windows that were in the room. glass everywhere, and she took the door off the hinges I mean she was. So they. They got her away from there, and in a safe place. And she called me. They called me first explain what happened and then she called me and I was like honey, you know you don't really need a password you have Internet on your phone automatically because I paid for it. And she. Oh, she was really happy, she was fine. And the school called again mad."
462.0,Provider,Because.
5823.0,Patient,"I allowed her to talk to the guy again and I was like well, I never thought of it that way you guys didn't tell me not to you know not to help her. I thought I was just helping my child, you know she was kind of in crisis mode and she didn't know what to do with herself, so I helped."
462.0,Provider,um.
5823.0,Patient,"But they were mad and that's when they said I needed to tell her everything that I knew and how I felt about it, so I did, and it because she's F. Through interpreter. And then. Really, paying attention to me because she had her phone and she was texting the boyfriend at the same time. yeah and then there was a staff member, I get her pay attention to the interpreter, and it was horrible horrible situation, I told her i'm gonna shut your phone off for a couple days I just said, I just want you to think about what's important in your life. And what you want to do. And so I did I shot her phone off. And every day. yeah it was, and she understood after why I did it but not right and. The next morning they moved her back into the dorm because she was in a in a house with just a couple other kids and more independent living situation. And they didn't think she was doing right because she was missing classes and she was staying up all night and she was naked in her room and you know talking to the boyfriend sending a new headquarters and. In a school setting you can't do that it's illegal."
462.0,Provider,mom. This is pornography.
5823.0,Patient,"So I understood, but she didn't she's like i'm 18 I can do, what I want, and you can, but you can't they're still rules, but she ended up breaking a window another window."
462.0,Provider,trying to get.
5823.0,Patient,into the House where her property was. They called the COPs and they had her put into a hospital. Like a psychiatric old.
462.0,Provider,Oh that's so hard.
5823.0,Patient,"It was very hard, because she didn't have a phone and I said, well, I told her a couple days and I would try to phone back on so I did, and I told her therapist and her therapists like okay well i'll try to get her her phone tomorrow. That never happened, I heard from my daughter 12 days later. and it's illegal. I ended up talking to a lawyer well my daughter's lawyer and my old lawyer, that I had from when I was fighting with the cf to get my kid. and They told me that's illegal they have. Three days, where they have to decide if they're going to admit her or if they're going to send her back, but the school wouldn't take her back. um so it was really difficult and I I told them, I was like I talked to a lawyer, what you guys are doing you're violating her right she said she wants to leave and you won't let her leave she is 18 she's allowed to sign herself out even if it's AMA. And then they finally let her go. She finally listened. So she signed herself out of DC because she had signed in when she turned 18 so that they will continue paying for her school. She signed herself out and she quit school just 30 days left to graduate. Okay, so. yeah yeah they were willing to work with her. because she was from to from the town that the schools in. The town that she lived in before she. paid for her to actually go to school, there, but the staff paid for her to live there. So the town that she was from said, we will continue to pay for her schooling, if she wants to do it in maine. Where I live."
462.0,Provider,Right.
5823.0,Patient,"So I tried to convince her and she won't do it. But she does want to try to go to the school, the high school that I went to year. um do I have to call them and see if they'll accept her I don't she has a very extensive IP because of her site is. right here, right hearing so i'm not sure if they could actually do what she needs in 30 days, I have no idea. But I have to, I have to find out anyway, for her. He wants to move to Colorado and month and a half. and I know what to do with her. love for her to stay home and. If she wants. She would like to get a job, while she's here, but it only be a temporary job for like a little over a month and I don't really know anybody that's going to do that."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's tough to find.
5823.0,Patient,"yeah I just haven't I mean she's a great kid she's at home and she's fine she listens to me she's respectful. If I asked you to do something she'll do it she's a little lazy but she's a teenager so it's okay um. Yes, typical."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5823.0,Patient,"But she's great at home, I don't have any issues with her it's just this boyfriend thing that's a little too much it's too much for her it's too much for me. yeah and i'm trying i'm trying to respect her and respect what she wants. it's difficult."
462.0,Provider,"it's a hard balance between like you said, respecting her and respecting what she wants but also having a little bit more insight as someone who's gone. through life and kind of knows that will okay someone who's 29 dating an 18 year old is is. something wrong there and then they're in a different state you don't know then never been in a relationship, you know, are you really ready to go to a different state and. live with someone and be in a relationship that's a big deal yeah."
5823.0,Patient,"And he. said he doesn't have the states have them, and I believe they were adopted. Okay, he blames it on the mother, which I don't know because I don't know him. I don't know the mother of the children, so I don't know what to believe. In my daughter is very vulnerable and she believes everything out of this guy's mouth."
462.0,Provider,Right.
5823.0,Patient,"So that makes it even more hard because she's. she's. Not thinking with her brain in my, in my opinion."
462.0,Provider,"Again with our heart right and she's 18 and that's what happens, a lot of that age, but it's so you've got to kind of find that balance between. Knowing that you have the life experience to know what's right and what's wrong here and finding the balance of supporting her but also kind of asserting yourself as as a mother and that's a hard balance to find."
5823.0,Patient,"I think that was the problem before. I spoil her tremendously, I mean I went without so she could have everything that she wanted UCF paid for the school but tcf didn't pay for her clothes or. Food that she wanted in the House, they would they paid for school meals, they didn't pay for anything else, so I spent a lot of money, using like instacart. Buying her clothes, whatever she wanted, and I think my problem was I was trying too hard, and I was. Not just being her mom but I was being her friend, too, and I think that's where I was wrong. um. My dad warned me and my say warn you I didn't really listen because i'm like i'm the mom and. I know what i'm doing, but I really didn't. yeah I did something wrong and. I think now i'm paying for it in a way."
462.0,Provider,"yeah but and that's a hard thing to admit and say out loud, but you know you're reflecting and being open and honest So what do you think is the best path forward for you in finding that balance and also just taking care of yourself through this, because this is very stressful."
5823.0,Patient,"and it's I really don't know i'm. Like. Right now it's hard because it's also winter um. it's warm today it's like 55 so it's Nice, so I can actually get out of the House and do something, but before that day I couldn't. So it's kind of depressing, but now that it's getting a little bit better outside it's, making it a little bit easier to do that so hopefully."
462.0,Provider,"Oh, you went you went blank there you're frozen for me."
5823.0,Patient,"I kind of got in a rut. Especially with all this happening, I got an era and driving back and forth to mass where she was in school, and it was just hard, it was difficult and it took a lot out of me and financially. Oh, my gosh it's horrible. So now, I will be driving back and forth to. Mass but. So i'll be able to save a little bit there I just I don't know i'm trying. I mean my fiance's great so i'm so thankful for him, I mean he's very supportive."
462.0,Provider,"Using the Lord. is really important. And i'm just thinking about that right, you know i'm just kind of looking at the goal is that last time, one of the goals was to plan a camping trip with your fiance have you been able to think about that at all."
5823.0,Patient,"i'm actually my on my. On my dad's side my aunt she goes camping every year she's done it for like 40 years um She invited us to go with her so. cool i'm I can't remember where is it's a couple hours away. When she goes we're going to go with her we. Great last year we bought a lot of the camping equipment, we just never had the time to go, so we actually have everything we need to go it's just, we have to go."
462.0,Provider,So.
5823.0,Patient,"we're going to go with her we're not sure that date, yet I have to get back in touch with her and asked her what day um but yeah. I think it'll be really good and. We wanted to go once ourselves, and then we wanted to take my daughter so i'm hoping that i'll still be able to get that chance before she decides if she's going to leave or not."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5823.0,Patient,"um it's it's a lot because she's she's on SSI on. because she was part of def def did all that and the school did all the other work so now, I have to do that work again and it's fine it's just a lot. i'm calling everywhere talking to everybody getting all the information I need so i've been working on that yesterday, I spent all day in town trying to go everywhere, like da just and everywhere, I needed to go."
462.0,Provider,"For her you're working really hard to be the best possible mother, that you can be."
5823.0,Patient,"I have to be, I have no choice, she was at a point where. She was telling this guy I want to have a kid with you, and he said the same thing. she's. And i'm like well what what the problem is is. it's not only that she just turned 18 with what she has she has K post it's a very rare genetic disorder. and it's. she's had multiple seizures and been hospitalized for that and she's not. mentally an 18 year old girl or young woman she's more like a 15 or 16 year old. So she's not as mature as like you or I might have been. When we were her age. So she's got to take things a little bit differently, but she doesn't realize it yet um if she has a kid the child could have cables just like her. And then she would end up being in and out of the hospital this boyfriend does not drive."
462.0,Provider,"My dog, I mean ever so unrealistic right now to even think about having a kid."
5823.0,Patient,"I know, and I talked to the boyfriend and I got him to. Think about things and I. tried to tell him and. You know at least warn him things that could happen if she does have a kid. And he's like well you're probably right it's a good idea to way."
462.0,Provider,I don't know her healing.
5823.0,Patient,"To me, or being honest, but my daughter did agree to wait. At least until she gets married. Which is great, but hopefully. There are no. accidents. Because they happen."
462.0,Provider,They do.
5823.0,Patient,"I had I was on birth control, when I have my daughter, I was on the shot, so I know that. it's not 100%. So I worry about that yeah. it's a lot right now um but i'm going through it every day, and my dad's been a huge support to um. Because when I was when I wasn't myself when I was using my dad took custody of my children so he's been a big part of my daughter's life too so he's he's been really supportive of everything that i've been doing and have her and. i'm just i'm really lucky I know i'm really lucky, I have great people in my life that are there to help me if I need if I fall down."
462.0,Provider,So that is important and will that's been a goal to to just.
5823.0,Patient,maintain the family and support for recovery so we'll keep that going and.
462.0,Provider,"You know you're finding that balance again between asserting yourself as a mom and supporting her and the. goal, you know, maybe picking and choosing like you kind of have like Okay, the having a child is picking and choosing yeah i'm going to pick and choose that one because it could be. so severely difficult for everyone and involves you know, obviously, bringing a child into the world so maybe that's a good way to approach it to just kind of picking and choosing like okay so. You want to see him okay right you want to have a kid let's let let me, you know pick this battle, instead of another one, so that could. be a thing to kind of keep doing it sounds like you're successful in approaching that."
5823.0,Patient,"i'm trying I didn't really know what else to do, especially when she was in the hospital I couldn't even contact my daughter."
462.0,Provider,that's so.
5823.0,Patient,"So I asked my daughter's therapist I was like well what if I talked to the boyfriend and see if I can convince him to help us. know some on. Right and and she said yeah that's a good idea, so they did allow my daughter, to use a tablet one day she wouldn't talk to me, which I figured because she was mad at me for for violating her privacy in her space and I get."
462.0,Provider,It.
5823.0,Patient,"I totally get it, I knew I did, and I knew what I did was wrong. But I told her I did it out of love and she did forgive me so we're good now um. But the boyfriend did help. He did help calm her down reassure her because she was afraid he was going to leave her over there and. So I have cats things open with him. Because I don't want to lose my daughter in this."
462.0,Provider,"etc to to. yeah keep things open with him and. Right, if anything, again pick and choose what you want to. Cry you indicate about."
5823.0,Patient,"Right like I haven't. There was a minute or I wanted to flip and say. you're not calling. I want you to lose all contact with him, but I know better, I know that's not going to happen so."
462.0,Provider,"Right, I mean that's the rational choice, but again there's it's you kind of have to find a middle ground in order to appease her so that you can stay at least. In the in the communication in the relationship and then pick the things that you notice as like whoa like having a kid whoa no let's you know okay here and talk about this. yeah."
5823.0,Patient,"yeah she's. she's pretty receptive which is great, but she's very stubborn also um when she puts her mind to something she wants it she's gonna get it um so I yeah I figured I just better ease into things and. Working with her, and if we can compromise at all, I will. Good that."
462.0,Provider,"You want to protect her which is great, and you can protect her from some of those really big things, and it also might be a process of learning. What relationship yeah like what the reality of living with someone in a relationship is like this is a big big deal. Just we're in love you know it requires a lot more than that."
5823.0,Patient,"Right exactly. yeah it's a little more complicated, too, because this guy doesn't even have his own place he lives in a really crappy trailer park he. And he also lives with his best friend and his best friend's Father so he's in a trailer with two other men and he's gonna bring my daughter into that situation and he said it's not a good trailer park there's a lot of I think drugs and."
462.0,Provider,find that sounds. Pretty unsafe for 18 year old.
5823.0,Patient,"girl absolutely well, especially since i'm in recovery. You know in recovery. Realistically, I have to thank my daughter has a chance if she uses drugs. to become an adult herself. Definitely, so I did talk to the guy and I asked him, please promise me not to introduce her to drugs, please help keep her away from them, I said she is at risk of becoming a user herself if she tries them. i'm not saying that she would. But it's possible and he said. He wouldn't let her. i'm just hoping he'll keep his word."
462.0,Provider,"Right well that's good you know that's another thing to intervene on like the having a kid trying, you know and being aware of that and that that's why you're working so hard to keep relationship by not just going oh cold Turkey nothing right. So right it's a tough balance to have really delicate, but you can keep keep doing what you're doing picking and choosing where to communicate, you know, hopefully, he is being honest might be a matter of her kind of learning the reality of relationships and maybe having a heartbreak. Trying you know kind of maybe moving on."
5823.0,Patient,"Oh, I hope, it's that simple and I don't want her to have another heartbreak but if it's that. over some of the other possibilities that it could be then i'll be i'll gladly accept her coming home with a broken heart. Right last night just need to go and kind of learn and and."
462.0,Provider,"You can encourage her in any direction right maybe not to go, you can speak your piece, but again just remembering that you can't control other people, but you can pick and choose what you're going to advocate for and then remember that you also have to take care of."
5823.0,Patient,yourself right.
462.0,Provider,yeah I mean this is just a really tough situation teenagers are are hard it's a hard age.
5823.0,Patient,"Yes, very I agree, this is the toughest that it's been so far um I did see my son, though, on a good note um unfortunately it was the day that my daughter was in the hospital. So I couldn't bring her with me, which I normally do. But I had the best visit with my son that i've ever had because it was just me and him and we went to the movies, and we went out to eat and we talked. And we literally sat in the car and we talked for like two hours, it was amazing and he's he's amazing he's such a beautiful bright young man i'm so lucky both my kids are amazing. mm hmm yeah it was it was a very good day and it it like melted my heart, just the way he talked to me, and he kind of opened up about some of the issues he had with his father, and it was just Nice that he was able to talk more openly. and not have to worry, you know because, like when when his sisters with us, when my daughter is with us, she wants to know what we're talking about, so we have to sign to her and it just it just becomes more complicated, so it was just nice to have a great. Time yeah it was it was wonderful and then. I did. My my children's Father just got out of prison. And I i've always been opened with my children and I told my daughter, and she wanted to see him so she friended him on Facebook and started talking to him, and she asked if I could bring her to meet him because he's only a half hour away from here now. So I did I brought her to see him um they had. Their together um and then, when he's living in like a hotel efficiency place so they went back there and they talked for a little while, and I was right down the road I didn't leave. Just in case she needed me so. Right she did get to it, she didn't get to see her father, which was something good for her, she was nervous and uncomfortable like when he touched. Her things like that, but it was good, it was something that she needed to do. I think it was kind of a goal of hers."
462.0,Provider,So can be healing.
5823.0,Patient,"I think it was, I think it was it was something she definitely needed to do, and you know the The great thing was was. She was open to my suggestion she's like is it Okay, if I do this and I was like well, of course, i'm always going to support you. i'll never keep your dad from you, I would never try that. um I think every child deserves I both parents it's just unfortunate that not every kalkin. Right, so I I want them to have a relationship, and I hope it's always going to be a good one from here on out it's just. It hasn't always been so they did have a good visit, which was great. Okay, so some good things have happened, and you know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah okay that you know that there is good things happening like you said with your son so. It sounds like for your goals, we can keep some of them going and creasing your self care time for yourself using your family and friends, you know fiance for support, have you been maintaining the methadone treatment."
5823.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. um I have actually gone down I am at 120 milligrams. But i'm stopping here for a little bit to make sure that i'm okay. I did I promised the doctor there at the clinic that if I felt uncomfortable or if I felt I needed it I would stop tapering so I did so i'll stay at 124 little bit. Good."
462.0,Provider,"Good work that's great yeah. going down this is always good, and you can take. Take your time with it yeah get you know, to help with the rut that you talked about you know, following up about the camping trip. Right mentioned last time, finding some time to read you know just a little bit of relaxing time to is important, is there anything else that you think would be some good goals to work on over the next couple months."
5823.0,Patient,"um. I my biggest goal is to still work on my relationship with my daughter um. I definitely want to make sure that we are in a good place if she does decide to leave um and my son to both of them. My family's all I got so they're very important to me, I just want to keep working on my relationships with the. With the people I love."
462.0,Provider,"that's really good, what do you think. helps you. keep working on those relationships is it like spending quality time having conversations."
5823.0,Patient,"Both being able to talk to them is really important, and i've been learning a little bit more asl. So I can talk better with my daughter. And she's actually been teaching me and she loves teaching me so that's a really good thing that we kind of bond over. So that's That is another one of my goals is to learn more sign language, so I can communicate better with her."
462.0,Provider,"Okay perfect so learning sign language to communicate better spending quality time having commerce being open about your feelings, is it sounds like yes important part of it too."
5823.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely."
