298.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so how is your medicine working for you."
5056.0,Patient,"um so the results it I don't think it's managing my depression anymore. i'm having. I thought, so I had mono and so that's why i've been so tired. And I found that that was causing some of my depression, but I just having a really hard time doing my dishes and brush my hair and things like that are super simple that seemed like so exhausting for me."
298.0,Provider,"And, have you tried things to replace your dopa mean."
5056.0,Patient,Like what.
298.0,Provider,wellbutrin out all.
5056.0,Patient,"I have, I think I was on wellbutrin once, when I was pregnant with my second child and I didn't really do anything for me um but no I haven't other than that. I just feel like there's no. I just have all these things I want to do, but like getting there is just impossible I just I feel like getting out of bed is just a chore every day and it felt like we're guilty was kind of handling that for a while, but then it kind of stopped."
298.0,Provider,"Right so rick salty works on different receptors and my advice, my first advice would be to. If you need motivation figure out how to get dopamine and, if you want to do that, naturally, go, naturally, if not my next choice would be will be Richard and the next choice, if you failed will be a trend like it didn't work for you, then we would look at a stimulant. If you filled it. um but you know it was hard to get to wreck salty. yeah I don't want to give it up too easy."
5056.0,Patient,"Now, how is results with pregnancy, though."
298.0,Provider,"Like salty with pregnancy, did I miss something you're pregnant."
5056.0,Patient,yeah I mentioned during group last week that's why.
298.0,Provider,i'm so sorry yeah that's me dead.
5056.0,Patient,I yeah.
298.0,Provider,congrats um. let's look at. This for pregnancy.
5056.0,Patient,"I did some research and it said it's safe but the bb can have withdrawals after a third trimester so like I don't know. If that still I don't know i'm not an expert, so you went to to. write my mommy's on a meeting and then we'll talk after okay."
298.0,Provider,When do you have your first.
5056.0,Patient,webinar please um my first ultrasound is next week and then my they couldn't get me an important appointment until November 22 I think. On that point i'll be like three monster long three or four.
298.0,Provider,"I cannot find that it says it's anything bad about rick salty for pregnancy, but let me see. What the product, let me look in somewhere else and. That changes everything I won't be able to prescribe to you anything new. unreal it's a proved you know and you're. The Ob gyn they. They have to approve what I give you. Okay, like salty. salty and. Pregnancy category."
5056.0,Patient,hey. I got her.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so. pretty much i'm reading what yours is reading that um there's not enough information out there to show that it's bad during pregnancy, but there's not enough information to show that it's good um. it's the last. trimester that it gets really weird it says. yeah oh. that's where your other provider will recommend I don't want to go off of it if we can help it, but she needs to say get yay or nay."
5056.0,Patient,At least I got.
298.0,Provider,To take some time to. Look at it.
5056.0,Patient,Right.
298.0,Provider,"for making this appointment. yeah and, as far as your low energy you, you probably have to tough it out. Okay, sadly, but you can talk to her about what I said about wellbutrin giving you energy working on dope for me. and see if what her thoughts are with it. The right so maybe we're out anxiety."
5056.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm on lexapro two and it says my anxiety is really well managed by my depression and, like my moods are just so unstable."
298.0,Provider,um and.
5056.0,Patient,"I just feel on top of the low energy and stuff and not being able to get up and go just being done, I just feel so you're at all everything, like everything bothers me."
298.0,Provider,"Right and a mood stabilizers are what help with irritability lamictal being particularly but again that's something you have to go by, with your Ob gyn i'm happy to prescribe it I just need clearance to do it."
5056.0,Patient,"Okay, and yeah she asked if there was like a release I could sign so she could have contact with you, so we could kind of talk worth so I don't know where I do that dre go to like the care navigators and just tell them I. need to sign a release for my Ob."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
5056.0,Patient,"Because that would be something i'd be interested in trying to figure out because i'm just. I just I don't know, I think, for both to hang around probably close to three I hate, since I had mono I really I thought it was just because I had mono that I was just feeling like this, but it's been six months now, and i'm still not feeling great so."
298.0,Provider,"Oh yeah and then the the pregnancy, it just depletes you."
