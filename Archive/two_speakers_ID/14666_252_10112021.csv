252.0,Provider,um. I think that women admitted more than.
14666.0,Patient,Right it's a good point.
252.0,Provider,"I think that women are more apt to say hey i'm not feeling so great, you know. than what."
14666.0,Patient,need help.
252.0,Provider,"yeah I think a lot of it really has to do with the upbringing, you know what. type of parenting style was your parents, you know and taking a look at that was it, you know men are the strong ones and take care of the family, you know they don't have time for feelings, you know all of those men work and take care of things you know. Then, those are really in my opinion, the type of men that would struggle asking for how."
14666.0,Patient,can see that.
252.0,Provider,"So it just depends. I don't know i'm asking for help that's for sure right. So. All right, so you're going to get the book. Yes, you're going to get an appointment with Mary and. and talk to her about your medication. To i'm writing a note for myself.

14666.0,Patient,it'll be great.
252.0,Provider,"So you get the book i've added in kindle. And so, when I got it, it was instant. It was an instant transfer, but the only thing is, I can't write notes in it and I don't have that, and you know."
