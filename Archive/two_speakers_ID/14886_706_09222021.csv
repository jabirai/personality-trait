ID,Role,Message
14886.0,Patient,Oh.
706.0,Provider,hi kyle how are you.
14886.0,Patient,Better how are you.
706.0,Provider,"Not too bad. So the last time we met, we talked about you, we did your bps and just kind of went over your history. And it seems like you were really struggling with the fact that. That. You had several different splits that had happened just recently that accurate. So tell me about them, because we had talked about they were very different."
14886.0,Patient,"yeah so. For a long time we've been drawing. In this Community known as furries. People like to draw animal characters that represent themselves and we've gone through many different characters to do that for a while and then. right before our sister started messaging us which started the. The whole dis association coming back, we were. Using a character marv for that and. Then we after that happened. We were also trying having two characters at once, just as a fun little thing because we sometimes can't decide on what character DS but, but when that happened we had both of the characters in our head as a different. sections of personality. They swap out and they talk to each other more have been added, since then. we're up to six now. We swap it to each other to take care of certain things because others are better at dealing with stuff than others."
706.0,Provider,"OK, so the dis association that happened with them did that happen gradually or."
14886.0,Patient,"It was. The two different instances about a week after the. message from our sister. But the the splitting was pretty gradual. There were a couple instances where a new one came rather suddenly afterwards, but the transition was. it's hard to remember exactly how. The disassociation that we had. A few times, one of them was just they were both only a couple minutes long but. One of them our vision we saw ourselves in the ceiling, while we were laying in bed. As if there were two of us looking at each other. Like physical bodies, and then we both started drifting away. Through the floor and ceiling respectively. yeah and then. With with the splits. I think. Mark marvel and Nelly would you like pictures of them we've drawn them in the past, we can link pictures and."
706.0,Provider,You can zoom. They can send them through. email.
14886.0,Patient,Sure okay.
706.0,Provider,So have them send two. As.
14886.0,Patient,One second still have to make a new note takes a low SK.
706.0,Provider,SK are you g. At bright heart health.com.
14886.0,Patient,Okay. So I can start. writing that getting the pictures is there anything you'd like me to talk about while i'm doing that. yeah I forgot what we were talking about earlier.
706.0,Provider,um. So we were talking talking about them and kind of how they're very individual and kind of what they what they do in your life as far as when they represent when when they come out when they they come out it's for a particular reason.
14886.0,Patient,So yeah.
706.0,Provider,"When you said that one of them was above you and looking down, you can kind of see you know the two distinct."
14886.0,Patient,"Was yeah That was a physical form, I guess, I don't know what the word for that so that was slightly before the split. Because it was our first Association for me."
706.0,Provider,"So when so when that this association happened, and you said you that there was a drifting apart from one another um what was going on, during that time was was there, something that triggered that."
14886.0,Patient,"beforehand, it was simply trying to think about. All the stuff that. was coming back because of the remembering the dis association, like the. instance with our middle sister and the ambulance like we didn't think about that much before but thinking back on it now that there was this association that we remembered it was just hard to stop thinking about it and."
706.0,Provider,So it's thought that the first split was way back when. Their sister slit their slit her wrists and the ambulance came that the reason that there's not a memory of certain times is because that was that first association.
14886.0,Patient,"I don't think the split happened until the recent this association. Okay yeah. Okay me, it might have been in the past, but we didn't have any sort of knowledge of. It happening or any sort of connection of the personalities to a character, which is what's happening now."
706.0,Provider,Sometimes people disassociate in a very traumatic situation as a trauma response because it's too much to handle so your brain just kind of shuts down.
14886.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And then that can cause memory lapses and not to say that's when this that there was a split that happened, but just that your brain decided. to disassociate from that situation, because it was just too much like if it would have had to been completely process and absorbed it was too much to handle does that make sense. Okay, so. Then, more recently. um they said that there's six different splits."
14886.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And then they. It was just being talked about how they represent different things, and I know we talked about that a little bit last time. When did they come out."
14886.0,Patient,"there's certain things that trigger certain ones to come out. we've been trying to reduce some of that because it spin making this kind of avoid social situations, so we don't you know the angry one doesn't come out while we're around other people. Almost have all the pictures. So, like the angry one is. clearer. picture ever. The what's weird is that them these characters we designed and drew them in the past with lore and images so. Certain things have happened as a result of stuff we've already decided. lira is a character that we drew for a video game that we wanted to keep separate from the rest of our. So we. don't talk about her to most people. We had another character, who. Has sort of taken over, like the public like if someone asks what they are and they're from the periphery part of the art. We use that name instead but she's also become a part as well. Almost have a photo. Already sorry. The captain who is asleep every other month and we said that already. was kind of the. right hand. who's the one currently out. Lots of. anxiety and I think i'm. not looking at the right area to get these pictures sign. I think crashed."
706.0,Provider,Oh now.
14886.0,Patient,The thing I was looking at pictures on. Sorry. doorway.
706.0,Provider,"Alright, so let's talk about."
14886.0,Patient,So the first three are in the first picture that you. That are kind of all. group picture. marvis the the blue. light blue one. Was the purple what the yellow lie and then now he is the. cream colored water.
706.0,Provider,haven't received them yet.
14886.0,Patient,Oh oops.
706.0,Provider,"yeah I have them OK. OK, so now tell me again."
14886.0,Patient,"i'm also. The sort of like bluish green one is a morph. In the in the sort of three group picture the purple one is zero and the cream one is now it. and Then ozzy is the bird. lily is the one holding a chair and lira is the mouse. marv is the captain. Whenever when the short time he was out. You know awake. everything seemed to go great lots of confidence. When we went shopping we weren't tempted by any like. donuts or whatever stuff that we normally get tempted by as we shop. At morning exercise the most. But he's been asleep for all of September so was been kind of doing the important stuff. But she's very nervous about it all the doctors appointments and therapies and physical therapies. She she's the best for that, even if she sometimes doesn't know. words. To say next. Nelly is the. she's the most social one. But. Lately, she hasn't been out much because of. Lack of stuff like. She usually comes out when we're. Like doing the weed stuff and all that. The the next one, to talk about would be the mouse lira. She was the the fourth one to come out. and she's just super angry. She came out on a couple of people who we were close to said something about an artists that we respected. I think we talked about that already artist was stocked in closed one of their accounts. Because of the boundaries were broken, and then a bunch of friends. misread the situation saw him as a leech on the Community trying to come back. So we were angry about that. and The anger really didn't stop. We were coming home from physical therapy and it was probably about an hour and a half of waiting at the bus stop and the bus ride. And the anger was there, the entire time she. Just kept going. and eventually ozzy was the fifth she kind of came out as a way to sort of calm lira down. Whenever there was something to be angry about she would take over rather quickly, which was good for not being angry, but ozzy is. The quietest and the grumpiest. He can't really get anything out of her. So. We try not to. Get. You know angry and have where because. And then, when we mentioned earlier that liras from a video game that we wanted to have separate from our art career. But lily to the sort of. facade I don't know what the word is, but like. Like a liras the secret one lily is the one that if people asked about it, we would say but she's also like they're on their own now as well. She has actually helped a lot with getting back into exercising because she's all about exercise. which has helped because normally that's marvin he's asleep right now."
706.0,Provider,Why is marvin asleep.
14886.0,Patient,it's just something that we determined before all this happened is alien species is awake for 30 days straight and then asleep for 30 days straight because of the planetary rotation.
706.0,Provider,Okay. So lira she the angry one.
14886.0,Patient,So.
706.0,Provider,What does that look like when they're it gets angry.
14886.0,Patient,um. it's. it's not gradual it's very instant anger a. voice pattern changes. for holding something that usually gets thrown chloe try to aim it for something soft.
706.0,Provider,"Who helps with that, because if there is fury and she and she anger, then who is helping to make sure that the aim is that something fast, I mean I can't."
14886.0,Patient,"Do her it's just not wanting to break our phone. Only a somewhat recently have we noticed, some of them. I think the term that a lot of people use is fronting. fronting at the same time, like. spin Google and Nelly. And it's it's weird because it there's. They both have voices and they talk to each other, sometimes. And it can get. overwhelming, sometimes with all the thoughts."
706.0,Provider,So. Do they all speak at once.
14886.0,Patient,"Sometimes. Sometimes whoever's fronting can ask yeah there's a question and good answers. it's usually, when we're trying to relax or or sometimes fall asleep that the voices kind of just go on their own."
706.0,Provider,"So. What are they looking for what I mean by that is. There in therapy. What are their goals, what do they want to see happen."
14886.0,Patient,"To be honest, lately. This whole situation mentally seems to have. Problems we've come up with solutions as they come up like as he came up to help. You know, with lira, and all that. Most of our. It seems anxiety and depression lately has been a more of the physical and financial aspect of life. it's still sometimes hard to stop thinking about certain things. which causes. You know, we feel a little bit of anger, but. We haven't mentioned it, yet, but right now, our cats in the vet because last night, she started showing signs of a uti so that's going to be a couple hundred that we don't have and. We won't be able to get physical therapy for our hands, for I think nine months sorry nine weeks because of the way insurances working with this hand specialist so. yeah. worried about. rent and vet bills and being able to work. kind of has taken a bit more of a. Some more important right now, it seems."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. As far as they go when you when those things are happening as far as with the red things it that. Frustration like that that hand, especially as can't start right away. who usually comes out."
14886.0,Patient,Of.
706.0,Provider,"his mouth who. Which. I guess persona. Typically, the one. That is representative of what's going on."
14886.0,Patient,"We all sort of. have our own different ways of dealing with it. A lot of the time. let's see sometimes. It like when it's Nelly. she's pretty eager to get to work again, even if there's pain. ozzy is pretty despondent about the whole situation. doesn't really see a whole lot of. positivity in the future. was just nervous about everything. lily is also pretty good at getting to actually work on stuff. And lira wins when she's not angry she's usually not doing too much usually is resting."
706.0,Provider,"Is there any one of them, that is. helpful in relieving stress anxiety problem solving."
14886.0,Patient,"Last a month, it was marv yeah."
706.0,Provider,So marv and that's the Leader cracked.
14886.0,Patient,mm hmm okay yeah.
706.0,Provider,So. Is there communication with the captain.
14886.0,Patient,"Not right now, because he's asleep we've tried. Talking but there's no response."
706.0,Provider,When does he awaken.
14886.0,Patient,It would be a beginning of October okay.
706.0,Provider,When he awakens will will there be more peace.
14886.0,Patient,Hopefully. Go. boost the morale a bit. yeah there's not a whole lot of. That going on right now okay.
706.0,Provider,"So. kind of once again back to that original question, what do they want from therapy, how can I help them. Do they want to not be disassociated anymore, do they want to be one."
14886.0,Patient,"Not. Not being one, to be honest, this it's. it's nice having the stuff that we spent so long working on as an artist sort of almost real. I guess. it's hard to say. This association has kind of decreased since we stopped doing we'd."
706.0,Provider,Do they think. Oh.
14886.0,Patient,Oh.
706.0,Provider,Did you hear what I said.
14886.0,Patient,"No, sorry. For a second."
706.0,Provider,"um do they think that it's the marijuana that was causing that extreme this association and so that's right it's more mellow now, since you stopped using."
14886.0,Patient,"It it might have been that it might have been simply. i'm not being used to the I. mean the first time, it could have been helped and then. Something that's you know the memories and having experienced it again cost another one. It could have been. helped by the weed for sure."
706.0,Provider,"So. I think first and foremost, what we need to look at is. What. Is the benefit of each persona so. Can I tell can I can I tell them what I think happened. So what I think happened is. Over the course of time, there was a lot of stress, there was a lot of trauma and. Eventually. Their mind created the split because each persona can represent a different feeling. So as one. They could not express all of the feelings that they had. So they associated that with characters and became that character with that personality trait. Like the leader, the angry one the peacemaker. Because, as one they weren't able to accomplish those things. But with them being SEC six separate and focusing on one thing they're able to communicate those feelings. And not have them all bottled up and I feel that, until then, they had all of their feelings in meshed into one and they weren't able to express them now that they're. disassociated from each other and they're very separate they're able to do that, and when they're not needed they go dormant. Until they're needed again."
14886.0,Patient,Does that make sense that makes a lot of sense yeah actually.
706.0,Provider,So.
14886.0,Patient,We always told that we we bottled up and could never express our feelings and. that's pretty true we used to go to certain therapists as a kid and would just be unable to give any information at all.
706.0,Provider,"So. If, in fact, they want to. Stay disassociated from each other. Then. The question is, how does that work. out in like the real world when each persona comes out does that change, who is represented so. Do you know does each persona talk differently, do they act differently. Is it obvious to others from the outside, that there's another persona coming coming out of these one of these six Do you know what i'm saying."
14886.0,Patient,"When we're doing stuff outside like doing grocery shopping we. Usually try to stick to one. But we also tend to not talk too many people. Were out. So it doesn't tend to be an issue like like say if, like on the bus ride home from physical therapy, it was all lira but. We weren't like yelling at people are talking out loud, it was just pacing and mumbling behind the mask."
706.0,Provider,So they're present has come out more internally.
14886.0,Patient,yeah it's like a shift and personality.
706.0,Provider,"So it's more it's more of a thought process, though than an actual acting out changing voice changing reaction. acting differently, like a different person it's more of an internal change."
14886.0,Patient,"But there is a little bit of an invoice patterns and. Ways of speaking. Like. That a few times lyrics come out when you were home alone so she got a bit louder and. Voices extremely low and growing. yeah it was almost like we were trying to do a different voice, but it was just we weren't trying to is just coming out different and. same with Nelly. She actually has some speech patterns like certain letters sound different. Like that's how we've written her when we like. draw her and write. Like speech bubbles. Okay, and that."
706.0,Provider,is so. Can can they be called on.
14886.0,Patient,um. It sometimes it's hard with other people around. Because. It just when we're alone it's a lot easier to be open.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, for instance. um. Am I speaking with one of them now."
14886.0,Patient,whoo yes. A lot of like i'm. As an arms and. Long pauses trying to find a word. That that's pretty common with who will talk.
706.0,Provider,What does he bring.
14886.0,Patient,Those the kind of. takes the role that marv would have to for like like. Going outside doctors and therapists.
706.0,Provider,co-leader.
14886.0,Patient,yeah like a right hand man. Okay um. But yeah when when we're home over what tends to be resting on we're home right now but home and not doing something real tends to rest because it's very draining.
706.0,Provider,"So if I was to anger hulu. Then, when another person I come out."
14886.0,Patient,hey yeah not sure how. Easy we are to anger. But but. Certain things. If we weren't warned about could trigger lira coming out it's happened before watching a movie.
706.0,Provider,"Typically, triggered to come out to resolve a situation that is being it is angering."
14886.0,Patient,yeah although. She doesn't do much to resolve it's mostly just. Just. Loud anger. Okay outwards just unguided.
706.0,Provider,So where does the resolution come from to. make her more dorman.
14886.0,Patient,"It it ozzy comes along it's we've noticed the physical feeling when it happens, even. If she's the the bird with the big wins. Basically, it feels like a warmth, like a wings wrapping around and then. We come down almost immediately. yeah. And then. From basically in an instant it will be ozzy and. ozzy just doesn't. mean she's. The kind who just lays in bed, he asked her as she is she says bad, can you do anything now and then you just sort of leave cuz she's not. responsive or anything."
706.0,Provider,"So season, a forever mode of depression."
14886.0,Patient,Basically yeah.
706.0,Provider,And nothing and nothing can help her.
14886.0,Patient,"it's pretty rare. Sometimes hanging out with through and watching certain videos. can get her sort of laughing a little bit. Most of the time that just brings out Nelly and there's a very distinct change like. Especially with laughter like. ozzy. Sound as he. Barely laughs at all, but no he lasted basically anything."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
14886.0,Patient,laughs at the fact that she's laughing.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. They. They all seem very different. And what they represent. Is there any of them that could share roles."
14886.0,Patient,um.
706.0,Provider,Do they need six different entities or.
14886.0,Patient,Less or.
706.0,Provider,Or could they be three.
14886.0,Patient,"that's the thing recently when we've been sort of hanging around. With nothing to do with like had low and Nelly out at the same time, and just to listen to stuff and laying in bed. We haven't. done anything like that when people are around, though."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. They had they had mentioned in our previous session when we did the bps that they have a partner that they live with. So that partner. Has he."
14886.0,Patient,Think sorry.
706.0,Provider,"Sorry, has had they been around all the different personas or do they just associate with one of them."
14886.0,Patient,"I think the only one that they haven't met as lira because we try not. No, no, they were there for the movie. So yeah that they've they've seen them all."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so they've seen them all in there is an understanding."
14886.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,So do they know when they're talking to each persona.
14886.0,Patient,We haven't asked them. They might recognize certain changes. rude definitely has user boyfriend that we do a bunch of calls and. He lives in Florida.
706.0,Provider,So so room knows. Different persona is present.
14886.0,Patient,"yeah and he he can only hear us so there's definitely some vocal differences. Okay, at the very least it's easy to tell and ozzy's out because it's silence, except for. The occasional word okay."
706.0,Provider,"So. Does this work for them that this arrangement this situation, or is it very chaotic."
14886.0,Patient,"It so far everything seems to work. I haven't seen any sort of issues. The Community that we are in the free community is very positive towards that kind of stuff mental illnesses and. LGBT. Q plus sort of stuff. There there's a phrase that is used or tight title or word it's called plural like. someone asks you what your gender is, you could say plural because it's multiple."
706.0,Provider,"So instead of they are them, they say, for."
14886.0,Patient,"Any pronouns work for us honestly you don't even have to say, they could say you like you all you it anything works, because. The characters all covered the gamut of pronouns so okay."
706.0,Provider,"So. It is. Very intriguing very intriguing to listen to you know you all. Talk about. kind of each one and I guess, I wonder if I was speaking with a different persona if I would get a different. view of each one of the other personas Do you know what i'm saying so, like if I was into. lira would she see things differently, then anybody else."
14886.0,Patient,Probably yeah um we've had. Certain characters to argue.
706.0,Provider,Oh sorry that was my my.
14886.0,Patient,"Okay. Like right now, who is pretty young like neutral. and respectful but ozzy and now we have a bit of a."
706.0,Provider,rivalry okay.
14886.0,Patient,Because. Now he doesn't she she's the worst with self control. And since ozzy's kind of the protector. She kind of. tries to keep her in line.
706.0,Provider,Okay. um. I guess that would make sense um what. Do you all feel when there's a shift. That doesn't happen very suddenly.
14886.0,Patient,"It depends, like the lira one is always very sudden. But. Some of them are a lot more gradual. Usually after PT or a doctors or this therapy takes a while through to sort of. Calm down, I guess, or decompress."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14886.0,Patient,"Then there's like going from ozzy to Nelly like rule often watches video with videos with us so try to keep us cheerful and that can sometimes go from just being ozzy to Nelly in an instant. Because of some joke, and then it's just laughter from then on."
706.0,Provider,Have you all watch the movie inside out.
14886.0,Patient,inside out don't think so.
706.0,Provider,it's that it's an animation.
14886.0,Patient,"Oh, the pixar one no we haven't."
706.0,Provider,"um. It just reminds me of kind of what you all have. there's like a angry character there's the peacekeeper character that's kind of the LEADER there's the sad character that they try and keep in the circle, so that that sadness can't come out. All of these things happen in this little girls had it's really it's really it's a good movie but it just reminds me kind of of all the different personas that you all have each have a different role within you know. within your reality, you know one person does this one person does that sometimes they argue because they you know don't agree. And it's just it just kind of reminds me of that all this happens and this little girls had um you know she doesn't have a dis association, but it's just it just kind of. triggered that when you started, saying that they each had a different role. Like the manager, the person who like you know, make sure that kind of everything's done like bills are paid, you know those kinds of things. there's the goofy one who just wants to have fun all the time, and you know so um and it just it just feels kind of like that, like that this association is very much like those characters and you have, although different characters associated with each personality trait it's very similar. So i'm just reminded me of that so I didn't know if you've ever seen that."
14886.0,Patient,"No, but we would like to give it a try. I think it's pixar."
706.0,Provider,yep.
14886.0,Patient,It is always good.
706.0,Provider,Up inside out it's pretty good um. So. What are you all struggling with at this point.
14886.0,Patient,"The physical stuff financial stuff. syndrome we've been. hyper mobile joints. How are going to pay for stuff in the future, oh that's right we got a message yesterday from social security they denied disability stuff that we applied for a while ago but we're probably going to try again now that we have a diagnosis."
706.0,Provider,yeah so. You all should because. It typically will take at least two denials before even an approval.
14886.0,Patient,And we started early.
706.0,Provider,yeah so I mean sometimes there's several appeals before there's an approval the nice thing is that you get to go back to the day that you applied once you're awarded your social security it'll backdate and you get back pay.
14886.0,Patient,Oh that's great.
706.0,Provider,"So i'm even if 10 years from now, you finally get approved it goes back to that day that you first applied because. that's what you're entitled to."
14886.0,Patient,don't they also have a limit on how much you can have saved up on so.
706.0,Provider,"um yes so depending on what type of social security, you have yes there's a limit so once that money comes in, there needs to be a spin down but that's also why they don't do it all at once. Oh that's cool well, they will release X amount of the time. Okay, especially in large cases where they're they're needing to distribute a lot of funds."
14886.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"What I want you all to do before the next time we meet is write down your three biggest stressors. and possible solutions to those stressors so that we can discuss them and I don't know which one of you all is kind of the that manager that's gonna that can do that, but. That would probably be the best persona to to make that plan, because I think that. For the other ones that might be a little overwhelming."
14886.0,Patient,"yeah, in fact, we have a whiteboard on the wall now and wouldn't you know it there's a oh doodled on the bottom."
706.0,Provider,There we go.
14886.0,Patient,All the stuff about it yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So that is what I want you all to work on, and then we will check in again in a couple of weeks."
14886.0,Patient,"and see how that's going all right oh one last thing we wanted to ask. Was hrt if you knew the best way to get that started. We waited a long time. Yes, yes it started."
706.0,Provider,"So um. That would take a specialist. in that particular area I don't know that the doctors at bright heart can do that, although your medical provider through bright heart, you can have that conversation with them. You all can. get their feedback and maybe some information if if they can't maybe a referral to. Okay i'm a specialist that can. So I just I deal with a therapy part for you all but that's something that you are wanting to proceed with That would be my recommendation."
14886.0,Patient,"All right, thank you so much, absolutely."
706.0,Provider,"All right, kyle, we will see you in a couple weeks."
14886.0,Patient,"Thank you, Sir."
706.0,Provider,you're welcome bye bye.
