8210.0,Patient,"Go better. Well, I know. I know, last couple weeks, not been like i'm amazing but i'm not doing i'm not today i'm like feeling too bad i'm. doing all right, I guess. what's that."
207.0,Provider,didn't ensure move.
8210.0,Patient,"Well, so here's what actually happened we. I had to get out earlier than plan, because my mom and me, have been like just not getting along at all. And she I mean it's an incredible amount of stress on both of us and, but particularly really her I you know I get it, but she has gotten the last you know year or whatever the two years that's my dad left whatever span he she her out with she's been drinking more and she's been more. Meat she's been more aggressive and gain and. She it just is on it's just not it's not gonna it was not going good, so I had to I had to i'm found myself in this position again and sort of being like. homeless displaced wherever you want to call it so i've been working on trying to figure that out trying to get just get you know. Get trying i'm just trying to figure out what exactly i'm gonna you know what exactly i'm going to do where i'm gonna what kind of you know where what what kind of path i'm going to try and take to get to things you know settled and working out for me because I don't really have. a ton of like financial you know steadiness underneath my feet it's pretty rocky or at the moment, so i'm trying to trying to make it work. temporarily right now and stay in it, like the best Western here in harlan the town that we live in and but, of course, you know it's it's it's it's like you know. hundred dollars or 90 bucks a night or something like that, so you can't do that for very long, so I think I have one more night that I can manage here, and then I have to try and get Ahold of like. I have a representative at all sure, which is like a homeless services for the live for livingston county here in Michigan and see if I can can. Work something out I think they have like a. it's called like a rapid rehousing program where they will put you up in an apartment like a qualified apartment and they'll put you up for, and I think they pay, like the first six months. While you because i've been running around and trying to find some some work with really, really want to try and find like a job with dogs. Something that you know before I go and try and just like Okay, well, I have no other options, I got to get a job, like waiting tables, or you know. Cleaning dishes or something I mean i'll do it, if I have to, but I would really like to try and get a job with a groomer or humane society or shelter or something like that so."
207.0,Provider,"It might be um. You know, incredibly useful with. You have to seize the opportunities in some way. When when you can see an opportunity presents itself so okay follow me when i'm when i'm saying like here i'm working in tele health right. Tele health wasn't something that is even still to this day, a lot of people are not necessarily open a telehealth they prefer the face to face and i'm not gonna sit here and say that I, like the tangible I like the. Second, one, this one is blazing and my thing can cause. If. You sold Tele health was it it's pretty it's, not to say it's new it's just something that's up and coming, and you know, I think. With the pandemic ages boom that much more because hey you shut down. Just because we shut down and we locked up in the House, Mr guide to pay right we still got to eat, we still have to find some way to make some money. And so there were all these alternatives and tele health was one of those things that kind of took off and and certain things were you know certain standards are our. parameters, or, if you will we're kind of lower just accommodate Tele health, so you find a lot more people that work telehealth and are continuing to do that, so it makes people like me. who have who do does work that requires some physical interaction to say hey we could still do our work we'll just do it via. You know we're live web and so so that was something that boom it's funny because I, you know I don't know if you were in group on Monday and. But you know, I have to cancel group, because I have my own personal, family crisis, and you know, as I was sitting here, thinking that. You know, while you know, I have a family member that's in the hospital and having to receive like continuous for treatment, due to the coven. And so I thought to myself, you know i've worked in the hospital or you know I i've known someone that's a respiratory therapist and they talked about you know their role in the hospital and while that's true, but you think about. How respiratory if you're a respiratory therapist that's a good field to be in because one of the things is that with coven. A lot of it is respiratory right so it's requiring respiratory therapist to be available to be able to provide this service to these patients that in their. incompetent, I mean, and I, and I, and I thought of this not saying that I know the facts as. As related to the healthcare field in the hospital and the different roles and who works more they're always going to be nurses and you're going to always need doctors you're going to always meet. But certain professions within the hospital you're you're not going to see an abundance of right so like with social worker, you may have 124. or respiratory therapists once before, but now, with coven you probably need tend to the floor of respiratory therapist because, for every room, you need. So I thought wow that's something that's booming so as you think of different things you think about hey you know what this is my time for me to shine so i'm saying all of that to say, and I think we've had this conversation you love animals. And it is something that you just love rescuing animals people you're talking about with colon so many people are dying what's happening to these animals."
8210.0,Patient,"Great yeah wow I didn't even think about that, but yeah."
207.0,Provider,"What happens to the animals. You have all of these natural disasters that's running around us that's happening what's happening to these poor animals. yeah and so, if you watch the news. you're hearing how they're having animals being flown in for different shelters and so you're thinking about and then you have a work shortage now when you love something. you're not necessarily going to be like listen if I didn't get paid I remember doing this, no because hey when I love something i'm naturally I could do this for free, I could do this without you pain, because this is something that I love doing. You if you go out there and you look with everything that's going on in society today what is happening to these animals so i'm sure shelters are being bombarded with animals and do they have enough manpower."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I didn't think about that that's a yeah that's that's yeah and yeah you're right, you know i'm like I could I could do it, you know um you know, like I said. You know dishwashing what you're like average part time or like minimum wage job like I could manage it probably, but I think being able to work with dogs and it would be like it would make it that much easier, you know, to get up and go and do it. If you're yeah, if you like, you say if it's something you really love and you feel good about doing so."
207.0,Provider,"You won't do it, and the money will eventually come, but then you will be able to sustain yourself because you're doing absolutely what you love so when you think about it, because i've had other people. Who talks about like listen, I mean i'll see dog on animals and I grew up around animals, and I think, maybe what scarred me is when I see like dealing with no animals and my dad would be like you got to go do it so maybe that has scarred me a little. midget."
8210.0,Patient,"It like take care, taking care of just like you. On your like your pets or something you mean."
207.0,Provider,"My dad's like you the man was the only thing i've never seen the men rescued was a snake or lizard. Is everything else he would be he will be the one that's. Stopping traffic to go say so, we have had birds. birds birds that he done rescues. And we have, or whatever, and he always bringing on these other animals to the House and tell you to do with it i've had him Thursday. Night hamsters guinea pig somebody wanted to get their guinea pig get rid of their guinea pig because whatever the situation is and what does he say oh bring them all over. we've had that he's that's just him. And he's actually i've never seen him without a dog one dog passes away, for whatever reason, where we have them another. And so that's just how he is and so So for me, maybe that's part of the reason why i'm like i'm not big on animals, because you know when you push somebody to do something that they are not necessarily welcoming so. So you know but i'm just saying, like my son now he according to him when he gets older. he's going to have like $20 and have his sister come hell and i'm looking whatever money."
8210.0,Patient,yeah hold on.
207.0,Provider,he's.
8210.0,Patient,12 okay.
207.0,Provider,"yeah so you know and and I feel bad sometimes I see the little dogs and i'm like man I should get them back one, but then know and so, but i'm just saying you know you think about animals. and water, what is happening to all these animals with all these people dying, according to the media, with cool with what is happening to all these animals. they're left behind, animals are not like children okay they'll go to unpick husband or CPS comes in places that hey you know we got to find a place for this kid you know so. The thing is. If you think about right now I don't really have a job I need to be able to generate some income, what can I do I do love animals. find a shelter find a vet clinic or something i'm sure that you know a lot of places maybe because there's such a shortage they'll probably just say hey we'll give you on the job training will worried about the rest later I don't know, but if you don't explore it you'll never know. Out there you like you said. you've talked about a grooming service, remember, people are still a little bit, even though we see everybody out and about, but people are still a little bit leery the first time I when we had a dog, the first time I call the grooming service, I mean it was so the convenience of it. Somebody sitting in front of your House dealing with your animal and then bringing them back in and. You know, they just knock on the door. And said."
8210.0,Patient,It was a mobile like they do it in the van or something.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, it was a mobile, yes, it was something mobile and that's another thing that you know everything being mobile is another thing that's booming. Because you think about trying to go rent a space and doing all of that so everybody just buys a van old decrepit They fix it up. You remember you have everything that's being mobile so it's just a matter of you're in a situation where you're down. you're having to spend $100 a day living in a hotel I don't know that anybody really signs up to make that be their life, but I think looking at your current situation. And and and and becoming proactive in comparison to sitting in it, and ultimately wallowing in it, not to say that you are, but sometimes when you're in a bad situation, we tend to do that. But if you do that for a day or two there's nothing wrong with it, because this is where humans and that's reality and we oftentimes have to go through that but then picking yourself back up and saying. Listen to my advantage."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah and I do sometimes I get like gosh man, how did I get so like far behind on stuff I feel like i'm like man, I need a car, and then you got to finish school and i'm like I have. You know I had I sold some of my like really valuable like different sports cards and stuff like two years ago, or something and made like 5000 $6,000 and I was like okay i'm going to get a car and i'm going to do this and i'm gonna save this and. Over the last it was just all it just got sucked up so fast with the House and. dog stuff and dog medication and then I had to pay my mom back for some stuff and then before I knew it I had like less than $1,000 left i'm like. Oh man, I feel like it's a constantly like an upward climb, you know, and especially now trying to if I had even just like a dinky little car to get around and then make a huge difference, and this is really difficult. just trying to get around on foot, you know, I have to kind of stay close I either have to like stay in hartland here or have to be in how and have stuff within walking distance. And it's tough and I i'm trying to get a bike i'm trying to figure out some way to get a bike for, but then you know pretty soon it's going to be snowy and cold and so i'm not going to be able to do that either so. it's kind of wanting and it's kind of like oh man. boy I hope I can kind of climb out of this hole you know."
207.0,Provider,"For some time, sometimes when we're trying to climb out of a hole we think big sometimes it's starting small and starting small is the hard part starting small requires us to be humble. To be humble and patient and also let me tell you, those things are very hard i'm not gonna sit here and lie to you have to tell you that it's not hard, it is very hard. To be humble and to be patient and as you're talking like I know where I live here in Florida, you know it's it was in the Community, I live in, they have this nice neighborhood Facebook as well, just for the neighborhood. I just saw someone because, like i'm thinking like if I really. decided to get another animal my husband will say he double arrows to know. But even if I try to convince him just to give it back to my son, because my son finds every opportunity. To to point out that I I got rid of his dog, but the dog that I went and sought out for him, but hey this is neither here nor there but. You know, when I saw the email, because I, one of the things I felt like you know when we go on vacation or something like that I didn't I didn't necessarily like the idea of sending him sending the dog to. Oh God, what do you call those."
8210.0,Patient,Like a candle.
207.0,Provider,"You know I didn't like the idea because I mean like they probably they don't necessarily treat the dogs, you know the animals with care, the way you think that they would. And so, when I saw somebody in the Community put up a flyer and saying you know, like offering that service like if you wanted to go away on vacation they will. They will keep the you know they will sit the dog for a walk yes that's pretty cool and I saw another one who somebody was offering like a dog walking service like they will get the dogs and walking and I did see a young girl with quite a number of dog walking around in the Community. And what you think about little things like that, and so you think about how much money could you generate if you put. In this is flyers that they were putting on Facebook within the Community and so you're thinking, if you can generate. let's say $10 per dog to walk them whatever time and you have five dogs that's what $50 and you do that twice a day that's that's that's what $100 a day."
8210.0,Patient,"Yes, it's interesting, you say that because, when I was i'm in hartland now, which is like the town that's closest to my my home but. My you know my old home whenever I know in how will do, I was thinking about putting because, how will has like a huge downtown area that's really, really cool and has a lot of people in it every day and I was kind of thinking about putting up like. Some flyers and saying like hey doing like a temporary type of like babysitting service for people's because sometimes you know you might people might have something to do for an hour two hours three hours and they can't take their dog with them. And you know, like a you know walk them around and get them play with them and socialize them to take care of them, you know but. you're right in the aspect of like you have to have a lot of trust in somebody to leave your dog with them like that you know even a groomer and drop them off somewhere. But."
207.0,Provider,"But I would have I thought to myself, I would have rather I would have had if you said hey you know what I can keep your dog for a week, while you go on vacation and I think in my mind, it was. Because it's just it's your personal thing in comparison to sending the Doc somewhere, there was like you know and because, even when I asked them how they did it was looking like. won't be offended for a whole week and just sitting in a in a in a little cage which I never really cared for. And so you but you think about you know just kind of how creative people are getting with animals and the kind of stories that they're opening up. for animals, so you just it's just a matter of seeing what's out there, seeing where you are, and you know what. That is offered in I know that, even though I would groom the dog I didn't necessarily want to pay all this money to go take the order to get groomed and for me to do it, personally, I really care to do it. But you said hey you know what hey in my private home you're going to New York you're definitely going to charge less than if I took you, if I took it to a groomer because you know you're not necessarily paying for all the beats but. it's just a matter of being creative you're in a situation or in a place where creativity is all you have to sit and think about and figure out how can you do this if this is what you absolutely love to do, not to say that. Doing this or you know being you know, whatever it is, with animals it's going to necessarily pay the bills, but you can say hey during the day I could do this and at night, I can go work. As a server or as whatever you know just because right now, you just need to generate enough income to financially sustain yourself outside of the hotel."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no yeah and I honestly, one of my biggest motivations for the whole thing is to be able to have my dogs back because I can't. i've been i've you know, since I had to leave you know, two, three weeks or whatever it's been I haven't been able to see them and it's I mean I can't tell you every day I wake up and I have to. Like kind of shake loose just this like intense empty depression of not having my dogs with me it's been really, really hard so that's kind of like my main focus is to get to a point where I can have them back in and be able to you know take care of them properly and not have to. You know, because it's just you know you can't bouncing around from hotel to like practically being homeless and trying to find it just you can't doesn't work so but three of them, let alone one, so it. yeah it's it's it you're right it's daunting and I are pretty intimidated by the whole thing, but I also like well you know I do in the I think that I do, deep down, believe in myself in my ability to to. to pull out of it and MIT you know, hopefully before too long, find myself and stable spot yeah mm hmm."
207.0,Provider,"So it's just like pulling like you said, deep down it's just pulling up in reaching for that confidence and. Saying hey I don't um you know you want to do better, you can do better, but listen again you. Right now you're in a tough spot you like, you said you ask them question I can't believe I am where I am right now. And if you say today you've had that moment, and you say you know what i'm only going to allow this moment for half the day then have it. Have it you don't give it don't just just don't give it life for the whole day but a habit. You know, one of the things that I remember thinking, I was talking to a friend of mine, and one of the things I was thinking to myself, like even though. I have my space and and you know I my reality, it still doesn't take away from my reality of the thought of it going, you know out it doesn't she said it's Okay, and I said I recognize that i'm human i'm a human being. And while i'm a human being i'm having this I allow myself to go through it. But then I also allow myself to not stay in it and come out of it, but I did allow myself to go through those emotions."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah it's tough it's easy to not let it overwhelm you know for sure it can be pretty it can be difficult. And so i've i've met a few people in the last couple weeks, where i'm like I kind of see like people and even more desperate situations where it's like. If you let it get to to you and and you let it you allow it to overwhelm you and allow it to kinda like paralyze you it only gets worse, you know so. It gets worse, you know if you don't try it actively fix your situation it's not going to get better by its own you know by chance of luck yeah so."
207.0,Provider,yeah exactly so I you know it's you know. outside of your mom do you have other family members.
8210.0,Patient,"So the only family member right now and that that's close and in and still in the state is my brother, and he has been he's done the best you can and he's helped me in a few situations and. But he nowadays has like this insane work schedule, he works for some kind of security firm or something for. They do different types of security for all sorts of people and, like every other week he has to travel somewhere different like a different city in the United States, so go. And then he'll have a weekend week home at the office, but even when he's on the weeks that he's home, you know in Michigan he's still super busy going to the office and it's so it's been tough, you know not I know he's not doing it be you know. Because like Oh, he doesn't care like it's just he's fed up with it, or whatever, but he's just so insanely busy that he's not like you know what I mean he's not always. You know, sometimes i'll text him and he just. You either did you just I don't know so other than that, though my my uncle and cousins and stuff everybody else is out of the state or currently so. And i've been pretty pretty low on like all my friends from high school we kind of all drifted apart, maybe probably five years ago, or something we all kind of drifted apart and. I found it really difficult to like of course it's it's hard as an adult to make friends like that that closest friends, when you know in school, you see him every day you're able to. You know you develop those types of strong relationships and I found it pretty difficult just to try and like make new friends, you know. that's tough. But um but yeah I mean i'm glad I have my brother, but and even he I think him and my sister in law are going to be moving to like grand rapids or something within the next year. So it's kind of it's a little depressing it's like. You know. struggle with I like I like to be alone i'm more of a like an introverted type of person, where I don't I really don't mind to be alone, but sometimes it gets like. Like really like. it's just this like deep deep loneliness that's like up man, you know I don't know it's kind of depressing. I think a lot has changed, especially with my family in the last like two years, especially like since my dad left he kind of pulled the rip the you know the. Foundation was not stable, as is and then he kind of ripped the pulled the ripcord on everything and it just kind of crumbled you know so. it's difficult, but like I say I love my mom or anything, obviously, and she just. It was just so unhealthy for our relationship being around each other, like that and and, given the way she has been acting and and you know i'm not going to totally absolve myself either you know we both kind of reacted differently to this whole situation, but we just. It you get it, especially I think of somebody my age and being around your mom that much like you're not really supposed to you know, and I, and so you're you like kind of naturally develop this friction that's like. it's just uh yeah."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. It is um. and I guess, ultimately, you know, I think, being in this place where you are right now, it also speaks to. One in evaluating the their support system and the level of support that they have and sometimes once you start doing an inventory of your your support, like. You know, whether it be friends or family or what have you and was able to lend a helping hand granted sometimes our past interactions with them and decisions and choices, sometimes Barrett impact on how readily available one will be willing to to be, but at the same time. It does make you sit and reevaluate yourself and just saying hey you know what I do need to work hard to try to get myself back. table on my two feet, or what have you, but at the same time it's reestablishing healthy relationships, because life is one that when you are going through a crisis, and when you are going through, something it makes it easier to go through that crisis when you do have support."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah and it's actually interesting because, like I I have been. out in how old there's a Catholic Church that I started going to every once in a while. St St joe's Catholic Church and I I was always we were I was raised, like I wouldn't necessarily say raised Catholic because I wasn't baptized or anything and and my family wasn't like a really diligently. church going people, but we would go with our cousins you know fry are on Christmas and Easter and that type of thing but recently I started kind of feeling this like pole to kind of. Not only to kind of strengthen like I guess you know the type of spiritual like connection that I feel, but also to try and gain more support from a Community because you know. it's one great things about churches it's like everybody, even though they're not like related they treat each other, like family and they're. Really kind and caring and compassionate for the most part, you know."
207.0,Provider,"For the most part yeah. I mean that's that should be you know, the thing but it definitely is one where you know, yes it's her family or you know. For the most part, the more genuine one anyway, because you know, everybody that attended church eight yes, Sir, listen same reason, but. You know, naturally, you would you know they will offer some support or lend a hand and what have you but. Again, if it is something that is you know that's rested on your heart, it is reaching out in a. way i'm not going to sit here and say, sometimes when you really think about your situation once you put yourself out there you put yourself out there you're you're you're putting your vulnerability out there, and when you do that, you will sometimes will receive some of that back of. One you know someone being judged, but the truth of the matter is. You know what when we're in a place. of need, or what have you were always or when we're in a place where hey because i'm in this place, because the choices i've made the decisions that i've made. we're always wants to feel judged, but we have to push past that because at the end of the day, I still need help i'm in a place where I still need help. yeah so so it's not allowing that to deter you it's not allowing that to get the best of you. for being with open to receiving the help, because the truth of we're always going to be judged, whether or not we're doing good or whether we're always want to be judged like this is not without somebody casting some type of judgment without knowing the fact they have an opinion. Right and so. You know it's just really putting yourself out there, but again I think if you feel you know as you're reevaluating and you're assessing your situation it's putting yourself out there and just seeing you know. What is out there and building your support support system because. In the last week, I would say, of my life I have had. friends who. I have not spoken to so much in one, I have one friend i've spoken to every day, practically all day. And typically I will we will talk to each other every once in a while hey you know you read on my mind, and if you feel called and check in with each other, but when you are in a place that you are just crisis. And you will see how much people are just and you don't think in that moment you don't think hey where you know I didn't know that so much people will come and lift me up during this time of crisis, and it has been and so it's just the place like you know when you are in. a place of being alone and you're left with your thoughts negative thoughts will come in 100% they will but it's not allowing yourself to stay there."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah it's take control your brain not let your brain take control you type of thing and yeah I know i've always yeah I did that goes kind of back to a lot of my. The anxiety i've struggled with like, since I was a kid and it's been it's not been bad recently, but like yeah my brain, I have a runaway brain for sure, like it'll get get the best of me for sure."
207.0,Provider,"And it's a real thing, and it really It really is a real thing and and it's it's you know so like my personal thing is like my husband is currently in the hospital and he you know he's really fighting and so. is sitting in my thought. You can't I can't see him."
8210.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
207.0,Provider,yeah So what do you think is going through my head. The worst of the worst of the worst of the worst.
8210.0,Patient,yeah that's.
207.0,Provider,"And when you when you when your mind takes you down that path, what happened to your anxiety."
8210.0,Patient,shoots through the rails yeah.
207.0,Provider,"But, just like in group and everything that I, if I have to yank it back. But then I allow myself to go through it, because i'm human i'm still human and a half that allow myself to go through. But now I come to that place of recognizing just like you said you have bad anxiety, one of the things that i've learned. it's so cliche for the most part, oh don't don't stress yourself without anything don't do this naturally what we tell people when they're going through something right. I have learned in these last few days. That there is back to that statement."
8210.0,Patient,there's what.
207.0,Provider,"there's a lot of depth. To that statement. And how I learned that there's step to that too, because they when they tell him. The most important thing right now is for you not to structure. Because. If you do it affects your ability to breathe."
8210.0,Patient,yeah It stresses finally killer yeah i've heard that.
207.0,Provider,"And that's and that's what it's what that is it what that stress does to your body it's fight against your body's ability to try to repair itself, no matter how much medication and give you, no matter what we do if you trust yourself. it's fight against what we're doing."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and, yes, physically did for sure I mean you're I had actually like maybe two years ago, or something I had developed an ulcer. And the doctor said that he was pretty sure it was from just stress and anxiety and it wouldn't heal because I was just like in such a just not doing good so yeah it definitely is does a lot more damage than you anticipate."
207.0,Provider,"Because it's a it's a particular. Hormone that it releases and when it releases that hormone it becomes so toxic to your system that the body's natural ability to repair itself. Is on able because hey you have just released a chemical within your body that is caused by stress than you know the anxiety and everything, and so they see you and I was told hey listen, this is what you do. facetime call him and and you keep him so he doesn't get to that place of loneliness he doesn't get to this bad place and so it's keeping him out of that glass with all these are all of the things that you do and so here it is bad. To speak it and to experience it. Is two different things. Because now are you have such a clear understanding. Of hey you know what I could tell you not to stress yourself and but then to experience something to understand why. A person tells you not to stress, so you think about your situation right now you are quote unquote like you said, your homework and that is not even a coke on your reality is that you're homeless, because you're no longer in a home you're living out of a hotel. Once your anxiety starts increasing and your your stressors start increasing because of your current position. It limits your ability to really process and think about what am I going to do and how am I going to execute any point."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah yep yeah that's for sure that's for sure um it definitely brings in a lot of mental fog, you know, and yet like I said almost paralyzes you sometimes if you let it. So now. I was just curious, as did your husband get covert by chances that is yeah."
207.0,Provider,It is that that's the whole fight so.
8210.0,Patient,"I think it's. You know, one of the worst side effects of the whole pandemic, you know, aside from people getting sick and you know, whatever is the his family members not being able to see people like and that's almost does just as much damage as the actual illness, I think."
207.0,Provider,"I think that's I think that's the bigger damage. I think honestly that's the stress and and and being in communication with the health care providers that are you know working. You know, with these patients that's that's what they all say, and I have family members in you know, one of the things like. Knowing so many people that works in healthcare nurses practitioners and what have you know and so much of it, and a lot of them has helped me throughout the whole thing. Like you, and sometimes as much as as much knowledge, as you have when you're in a situation all that knowledge goes through the door you a complete idiot you know nothing. And so you know in them telling me ask this and ask them down and find out about this, you know, one of the things on. The number one thing consistently across the board with the people that I know personally and the people who are working with him, that is the biggest thing is when the loneliness second."
8210.0,Patient,Man yeah that's man's man.
207.0,Provider,"And now you're. it's because you're separated from your family you can't see them and and I have a cousin she said, the hardest thing is when. You know she was like the first day second day third day but she's like actually, that is just like the the clients are tackling because then. there's no real contact so she was like you know you got to do this, she was like you have to call him I call him all the time facetime, and this is all that you got to do, because if you don't once that starts setting in it makes it that much harder. And it affects your ability to breathe. And that's what you need you need to be able to, because if you have pneumonia and depending on how bad it is you have to your ability and they tell you that you know. If you can't talk they don't talk because it drops the oxygen the one nurse tells me because, when you talk you don't breathe. You only it's only when you stop talking you've taken a breath so when you're talking you don't, and so there were times, where he couldn't talk, he would just not attend. Because he couldn't talk so it's like you learn all of this stuff and you're like wow so you know you know you hear people say Kobe but if if. it's. Just one of those things where there's No two people can explain it the same way."
8210.0,Patient,"Right yeah that's man, I really say i'm sorry."
207.0,Provider,"yeah you know he's come around a lot of us coming around a lot so that's The good thing that's why I have my face, but you know it's just you know and, like, I said to you support is support is something that you need in life, if you don't have it."
8210.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"I wouldn't have been able to help. So support is definitely and it's it makes it it's very important to build up that support, and we have to be mindful. of how we deal with people in the moment when we have so you know if I have my emotions right now and I allow my emotions to dictate my action and I push everybody away from me when i'm in a state of crisis, how can I reach out to these people to be a support. Simply because there were moments, where I pushed people away so that's why I said support is very important. So I think. You know I would say, while you're in your you know the position that you are whatever cause. To be in the position that you're in whatever it is that. You know your limitations, I think, sitting in this time Wade and I speak it I tried to speak a lot from certain experiences that I had not from. just being a counselor but also, I think it speaks volume when you speak from certain experiences that one have outside of knowledge, I think, sitting in this place it's time to reevaluate. Your contribution to life circumstances, not everybody else's contribution, but your own personalized contribution to where you are today. Because if I don't look at my own contract like when I think about my husband, I often go through. Maybe I should have taken in a few days prior not just the one day I wanted to take an end, but if I had taken what, if I had taken him three or four days prior wouldn't have been this bad. And so, and when people would tell me things certain things I will fight again, and so, when I sit, and I take an inventory of my contributions to certain things. This is where I said Rochelle. You don't need to keep repeating these certain cycle. Because it's like i'm repeating the same thing, the same action and i'm expecting a different result. But if I want a different result, I have to tweak and change how i'm going about what i'm doing."
8210.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"But in order to do that, I have to look at my situation and circumstance and see how I contributed to it, what was my role in it. And therefore, then, except take accountability in stuff and say hey maybe I need to change certain things. yeah you understand it really truly comes down to that yes, every there's people who contribute to your downfall, yes, they do. But at what point do I take accountability for my role that I played in. And how I played it. And that's how once you once you come to that place this is where now you're able to make different decisions, this is how you're able to say okay well, let me try this and see if it works. It may seem small and minute, but let me try it and see if it works and once it work it becomes the catalyst to something new. That will meet to the success."
8210.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. Now you're right yeah.
207.0,Provider,calendar.
8210.0,Patient,I should be getting back on I should be close to be in total in you know good as far as compliance goes I haven't I. Not being home the there's an issue with getting my my drug test be because that's you know they send it.
207.0,Provider,to him.
8210.0,Patient,"But the what I was we were trying to figure out well anyways I got that I should have that panel pretty soon, and then the last thing I need to do is my blood work. So hopefully but they had their again is just I have to find a way I not having a car is like wow not having access to cars, like you never you don't realize how. How big a deal that can be you know. And like. yeah sounds like sounds nice living like a city New York or something where, if you want to walk you can walk pretty much anywhere, you want to go or."
207.0,Provider,Public drink.
8210.0,Patient,"And you know, not a lot of Asian admission."
207.0,Provider,"yeah so Okay, so I see your service today I sees that. The only thing is, your drug screen but okay so according to this your last trip was in May."
8210.0,Patient,sounds about right yeah they they said they were going to get one sent out but I haven't gotten any emails I know they normally will send an email saying hey we sent you a package and no.
207.0,Provider,"No, no, because they said they're sending it to the lab they want to go to the lab."
8210.0,Patient,To the hospital lab or.
207.0,Provider,"You Okay, so what I would do is call them to find out what lab."
8210.0,Patient,Okay.
207.0,Provider,"call them to sign up because Okay, so let me see if they said it to your mom would you your mom not hold it."
8210.0,Patient,"No, no i'd be able to be able to get it my brother would have to swing through and grab it sometime bring it out to me, but I, I think, then that's what I told him I think it was on the phone with them, two days ago, or something and. I did tell him that I had a pretty long I was, I was on the phone with them for a while and I think it sounded like we got everything worked out, so they might be doing that. And i'll just have to do it that way i'll just have to have my brother grabbing."
207.0,Provider,"I think, right now, just because it has it because, according to this, the last time that I see one being completed. The last time I see one being completed was. i'm looking in another chart. yeah they just sent it says. yeah the last, oh no, I guess, they didn't update it in the system. yeah it was in. Okay, the last time, an attempt was done was an all day. Oh. yeah yeah yeah. yeah it's um. It shows the last template me so it's saying that they sent it on September for. Not they didn't mail one out, I think this one is. they're requesting it, so I think you got to go to a lab for them."
8210.0,Patient,Okay well i'll call them and figure it out for sure.
207.0,Provider,"yeah it looks like they're fed they're sending you to a lab so so call them and ask them, and so you could tell them what lab is closest to you and make a fact that there. And you can do it that way, because you know, with all of the changes that they're what they're doing with bright heart, I think one of them. is going to be, you know holding I don't know if they are fully hold amounts, or what they're going to do, but especially when there hasn't been a drug screen that has been done in so long, was a requirement, the law requires it to be done every month."
8210.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, and actually so i'm I do take so i'm I have i'm on misdemeanor probation right now, and so I actually do truck out drug tests at. At a place and how will call DNA I do those like once every two weeks, and I think one of the things we're trying to work out was like to I signed an Roi forum. And they so they would be able to share the information, so instead of having it as through DNA and then having to also test for bright heart, they could just share the results. But then that. And that was fine, the first time I talked to them. I don't know if it was like Tuesday or of last week, or something, but then I talked to somebody not but two days ago and they. weren't quite that sounded the way they were saying talking to sounded like that wasn't quite."
207.0,Provider,"What I would say, comparable clinical asked to speak to Jamie see she's available. To speak to Jamie if she's available either Jamie or mark asked if either one of them are available and ask them them directly, because sometimes I do know with you know with new. Care now coming on sometimes I hear the mix the mix misinformation or mixed information so your video is awesome so um. But I would. I would say, ask for Jamie or mark and just tell speak to them directly about that, and they can guide you exactly what to do, I think that you know, maybe they're in whatever they tell you, maybe a little bit more credible, not to dismiss the other characters but. Jamie and I think she is if I want to ask if if I was going to ask something that's exactly what I did I would have sent me information to agenda, I would have heard it."
8210.0,Patient,said. she'd be our expert on oh that's Mary.
207.0,Provider,"Mary Jane oh no, no, yes that's that's our ranks. This is this is specifically for what you're asking for the drug screens, or what have you and if she can't give you that answer then she'll know exactly who to reach out to but. You can because I don't know if other people do the same thing, because I know we test for specific things I believe you know. yeah so um but yeah right now it's showing that it's a paper, one that was sent in this was the fourth, but then you know it allowed them to be sent to."
8210.0,Patient,"I wonder if I can do that, at the same because they did send my bait they sent my bloodwork over to the hospital so i'm wondering. yeah maybe maybe."
207.0,Provider,Maybe because right now that's what that's what it's showing out of compliance with is that. it's just your drug screen.
8210.0,Patient,"yeah i'll try and i'll try and get that done trying to see what I can get an address before Monday, so I don't have any problems with my."
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah I think if you get it and they get the results and put it in, then it can change your. perception that you have on here um let's see so let's look at the. Our next one, the 29th and we couldn't do the 29th at the same time."
8210.0,Patient,29th at 11 o'clock. yeah sounds good. But it in my phone 11 o'clock.
207.0,Provider,I will see you on Monday.
8210.0,Patient,"sounds good, I hope, everything."
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's looking at so that's a good thing, but thank you."
