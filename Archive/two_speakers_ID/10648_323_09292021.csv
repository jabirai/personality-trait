323.0,Provider,"Okay, all right that's good. Look at what adults feels like."
10648.0,Patient,yeah it feels it feels good honestly to be a. Like have a. Job where I can progress because. When I worked at a i've only worked it. to other places. And i've actually worked longer there and never got raises.
323.0,Provider,"Right, I mean that's the difference between like working for what you're gonna you know you maybe you won't have to learn, because you won't be bouncing around jobs but, like a good company that really respects and in values its employees."
10648.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,You know I mean if they're rewarding you because you're committed to them versus a company that just kind of takes advantage of employees and just. kind of goes through them like the mill. You know if it's not you will hire someone else kind of thing.
10648.0,Patient,yeah my dad's been there for 24 years this year and they've been great to him the entire time he's been there.
323.0,Provider,that's amazing. yeah it's a bright future for your buddy. So. how's everything else what's going on in personal life.
10648.0,Patient,"Not much, everything is going good."
323.0,Provider,"So hot, besides the couple times a week you sometimes see us, what do you do with your evenings or weekends, or how are you spending your free time."
10648.0,Patient,"i'm mostly. um. I spend my evenings with my girlfriend and then why Bob. And I see my dad. Every so often I seem to work but outside of work, I see him a. couple times a month."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm. Okay. what's it like when you guys see each other at work.
10648.0,Patient,"well. Usually i'll see him either in the lunchroom sometimes I haven't gone upstairs. In a couple weeks, but I used to go out there every day and seeing the lunch."
323.0,Provider,"Okay. And so, when you're on the floor and doing your thing, are you working in close proximity with others."
10648.0,Patient,yeah yeah there's there's people around.
323.0,Provider,And I you building relationships with some of those folks.
10648.0,Patient,"yeah actually i've actually known some of the people that work there for. quite a while, because my dad's work there. And I met him when I was younger. And then, some of the people i'm actually the guy who trained my dad on machine that I that I trained on I worked with him for a couple of days and I met a son. I talked to a son, a lot of lunch."
323.0,Provider,"So some of them, I mean people you're working around have been there, a long time too."
10648.0,Patient,"yeah yeah the yes, most people there have been there, quite a while."
323.0,Provider,sounds like it's a pretty good company.
10648.0,Patient,And they've only had I think they've only. have one layoffs the entire time they've been a company.
323.0,Provider,"that's pretty awesome. So you're going to be one of those guys that you know looks back and says yep 25 years one place, which is almost unheard of in our gen in your generation. That that like that happens, like errands and stuff like that, whereas now people move around, I think the average in career counseling like the research shows the average length of stay in a in a particular places like five years. yeah isn't that crazy and then people move that much throughout their adult life of of not necessarily like changing careers, but just moving companies and."
10648.0,Patient,Moving companies.
323.0,Provider,"And stuff, which is a lot of moving."
10648.0,Patient,yeah my parents have both been with their companies my dad's been with true fit for 24 years and my mom's been with her company 23 years.
323.0,Provider,Some good stability. awesome so that's that's really I mean they're they role model for you that you kind of when you find a good job you stay with the company. So that's pretty cool.
10648.0,Patient,"I guess, I really didn't think of that people my age. Do like i've seen. People that I graduated Louis. I have like three different jobs than a year."
323.0,Provider,"Part of it is, I think you know, in some ways there's a lot more companies like where your first job was where they didn't. really give raises they just crank people out if it's not you it's going to be someone else thinks it's kind of more like just get a body in here to do something. And so, if I think when young people just sort of feel that, then they just keep moving because they're always trying to advance and make more money learn something different. So it's kind of both ways people what people's mentality is as well as how the company treats them."
10648.0,Patient,yeah cuz I remember I quit. My first job. Because I had been there. Over a year. And I was doing I was doing. pretty much everything that. I was supposed to do and more and I hadn't gotten a raise. I was doing everything. My manager. yeah was supposed to be doing. Right so and.
323.0,Provider,And you're not wanting to manage your money.
10648.0,Patient,yeah and I wasn't even getting enough hours so. I moved on to something else.
323.0,Provider,How old were you when you like your first job when did you get your first job.
10648.0,Patient,I got my first job when I like two months after I turned 16.
323.0,Provider,"And that's kind of how you learn, I mean look at the difference between your the environments of your first job in the environment of this job. yeah i'm sure it's like night and day."
10648.0,Patient,"yeah and it was it was poor management, where I worked first time because. Like even not only was so I went to work there. It wasn't only the manager of all the stalkers and everything it was also also the manager the cashiers they were always getting complaints about how bad they were to the employees and everything, so I think they both ended up getting fired another under new management."
323.0,Provider,"And then, when you left there you went to did you feel like you went to a better place better job."
10648.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,"that's I mean, in some ways it's learning lessons you just kind of learn what's working for you what you environment you like, to be, and all that kind of stuff so. yeah yeah and then landed here."
10648.0,Patient,"yeah like where Am I now, though, because it's more comfortable I know a lot more people here my dad works there. If I really if I ever have any questions about anything that. i'm. Tom who trained me. doesn't know the answer to I could always ask my dad because he's he's already done everything that i'm doing."
323.0,Provider,"Which is nice, but even if your dad wasn't there, it sounds like it's a supportive enough environment you'd find plate, you know people that you could ask and. Help figure it out."
10648.0,Patient,And all that kind of stuff oh yeah I could I could ask a pretty much anybody around me if I ever needed help with anything and they helped me oh.
323.0,Provider,"that's awesome. Good so. Car college house get some saving to do. Obviously, if this is the job for you you'll stay in the area. yeah. terms of housing and stuff like that so. Is that your girlfriend's plan to just kind of stay in the area."
10648.0,Patient,"Oh yeah when, after she goes to college i'm not sure. If it was stay in Medina or not."
323.0,Provider,"uh huh. I guess there's time for those decisions. But the relationship continues to go well, you and her."
10648.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."

10648.0,Patient,yeah. My God. flowers.
323.0,Provider,"that's very nice. good habits, to learn early so you can keep up all that good stuff when you're you know 40 and been married for. 15 years and. thoughts to get old and boring don't let that happen."
10648.0,Patient,I never see my dad and my stepmom flowers.

10648.0,Patient,"You know, if you would have asked me a year ago. sort of thought that I would have. turned around and actually. thought about other people, besides myself I probably would have said now."
323.0,Provider,you're a living example that people can change.
10648.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,Sometimes those hard knocks of life really do teach you some valuable lessons.
10648.0,Patient,"That i've learned. i'd say I learned a lot from my parents, but as far as like a life lessons ago. I think some of the biggest ones came from this."
323.0,Provider,"yeah and some of those like standards of you know you don't want to drop down to. Some things that you experienced so. yeah better to learn that early you know if that's gonna be the teacher than, can you imagine like you know being 20 something and still out there, doing goofy stuff and worrying about laws, and that in police."
10648.0,Patient,"yeah and i've seen i've seen people that are like even older than that, like 30s 40s 50s."
323.0,Provider,"You know, doing stuff. yeah it can be hard to kind of see that and it's like When will you get out of that system and out of that rat race and stuff sometimes though it becomes a way of life for some folks."
10648.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah when I was. When I was in a county like people were talking about how they were getting out and they were just going to. Go get a higher go get drunk and I was just thinking to myself, I was like. This isn't enough it. do well yeah and I I just didn't understand because that's what like they were in there for that stuff and I was. I was thinking to myself, I was like well stop doing it. yeah you fine, but if you're going to go through the same thing you're just going there right back in here."
323.0,Provider,"I mean in addictions tricky like that, like it can really mess up your thinking, to the point that you, you know, whatever you spend some time in jail and all you can think about is getting back out there and doing the drunk."
10648.0,Patient,yeah like the one guy that I knew. That I. I kept in contact with him after he got out while I was in si si I was doing because he was a addicted to. opiates. And he got out and two weeks later he overdosed.

323.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And by us like the middle of day if the sun is out still gets pretty Nice, so I can wear a jacket or a sweater or something in the morning. And then you really don't need it in the middle of the day, but if you're working until like it starts to get dark it's cold it's pretty cool again. If you're out and about."

323.0,Provider,"mm hmm. just in time for you to get some driving privileges. So well I can't wait to I know you can't wait to hear, but I can't wait to hear for you, because i'm hopeful it's going to be a positive outcome."
10648.0,Patient,"yeah me too, and when I talked to my probation officer last week, he said uh if she asks asks for his own recommendations he's going to recommend that. She grant them because i've done everything he's asked and more."
323.0,Provider,Somebody. yeah it's always good to have them on your side. yeah putting in the good word for you.
10648.0,Patient,"yeah because, ultimately, if. say I wasn't doing what I was supposed to and cheat and he said no. That wouldn't look for the driving privileges or just probation in general."
323.0,Provider,"Right well and then that probably in most counties could call you back in the court to kind of see like what's going on, how are we going to get this right. And they actually add time on probation which would."
