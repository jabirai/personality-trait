298.0,Provider,Oregon Tina where brookings organise.
18614.0,Patient,Ah. amen Google map. I mean it definitely sounds familiar but let's say is the. East. South um yeah so it's close to like meant for and it's on it's a coastal town.
298.0,Provider,"yeah so we're three hours from medford but we're right on the border of California, and I am on the border of California and Oregon on the Oregon side, so I get so excited when when a patient comes from Oregon and. I have eight states that I practice in so I don't have a big group from Oregon i'm thinking why, because we need access, you know that's why I became a provider, so we could have access to mental health."
18614.0,Patient,"yeah. I can tell you my experience, and so I recently switched health insurance from Kaiser to health net and everyone who I called I use their provider search thing. Basically, everybody who had a you know, a physical location or was in portland proper none of them were taking new clients, even if it said they were taking new clients so. And i've had some other friends who had similar experiences with me, for me, I specifically was looking for a psychiatrist or someone with prescribing abilities, but I have friends who even just for standard counseling they've been having a hard time. So anyway i'm grateful that able to connect."
298.0,Provider,"So can I share with you about our program to make sure you feel like you're in the right place, yes okay so we're a program which means there's like some things to it's kind of big. Do you have a therapist on the outside. Yes, okay How often do you see that therapist weekly. Perfect okay so that's one part of our program which you've already met that part the other part of our program at first it's a lot, but it decreases. You go to group therapy one hour once a week, give me a month to get to know you then I will bump you to you can ask me, can I go to two times a month and then after like six months, asked me to go once a month at at those group meetings I will refill your medications. just get to know you be more confident in my diagnosis and at any time, if you want to make an appointment to see me you're welcome to do that also that's our program is that OK, with you."
18614.0,Patient,"I mean I am willing to give it a go my initial. Risk my initial thoughts about group therapy is that it doesn't resonate with me a lot. And most of my experiences with groups basically my well my experiences with group therapy were either when I was young and. My father who had ptsd from Vietnam, we would do that so there's like some loaded stuff there and then also some loaded stuff with when I had to get an ex into rehab. That there was also a group therapy there. That anyway, those are my experiences with it. and I don't know. But I mean i'm willing to give it a shot."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and at any time, you can just try it yourself, and you can ask for referrals okay so you're not signing and live your life away, I will give you prescriptions so. Okay i'm sticking with that what medications are you on."
18614.0,Patient,"So i'm right now I am on bupropion 450 milligrams tell me a certain, which is a antihypertensive and and are an NGO tense in receptor Blocker. that's 80 milligrams Guan foreseen two milligrams oh in the boot propre on in the corner senior both extended release um and. Oh in prep. True beta yeah."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so with the wellbutrin do you take it together a whole a 450 at one time, yes, how do you do you do okay with that."
18614.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so I take the well my. hundred. 350 at Kaiser I took. But I take them all at once in the morning, and it seems good or it's not not bad."
298.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. you're always welcome to space it out a little and do a 300 in the morning and then a 150 around lunch that's that's usually the preferred way, but if people tolerate it all in the morning and they don't have any type of crash in the evening and so be it. um. What are your stressors in life."
18614.0,Patient,"um yeah so. there's. been a few a one i'm in is my my job, which is in many ways, pretty cushy but not. Fulfilling and also demanding so that's been a little bit hard. I live with. and A 75 year old, who I moved out here i'm originally from the Boston area but came out here for school and stuck around."
298.0,Provider,taunton.
18614.0,Patient,"Oh well, family yeah."
298.0,Provider,So cool so.
18614.0,Patient,"yeah and so he was a the they actually a teacher in the academic decathlon coach at my high school my mom threw me my my dad died of a massive heart attack, when I was 12 and my mom threw me out of the House when I was 14, and so I got taken in by a couple different people. George person who had me through a sort of sophomores to lead software to senior year but. Anyway, a while a little bit ago I moved him out from Boston because I knew that he was single retired and just alone in the House, and whatever but. it's still a it's a little bit of a stressful thing in terms of i'm not doing a lot of active caregiving but it's starting to do that and it's a lot of like cleaning up after and. i'm like i'm vegetarian and very much about everything being ECO conscious he's like smokes tobacco in the House and eats red meat, and all this sort of stuff so. there's some issues, sometimes with just feeling like under assault from odors when I say it, it sounds pretty trivial, but when you can't find an escape or a safe place in your own home, it can be quite distressing so there's that i'm on."
298.0,Provider,"Please, please, I understand i'm a vegetarian, and there were having people visit us in the smell of their cooking is just like Oh, and I don't even live with them."
18614.0,Patient,"yeah no and he's got a I also think that he over cooks everything so he likes the meat really crispy or whatever and i'm like well that's extra like oil residue like all over everything and whatever so there's that. I a couple years ago the House across the street from mine came on the market, and so I bought that so I could try to cultivate a little bit of community. And it's still, I think, a good thing, but we started really in like. January before. The March that coven hit so it's. there's been a lot of different things going on there that have been stressful from various levels and. stressful being a landlord which I didn't necessarily fully you know think through because I was very much you know being you know idealistic and whatever um. And I had a neighbor i'm saying using past tense I think she might still be there, but luckily she's moving but who moved in slightly before the pandemic and then started to try to take a portion of my yard. And who put cameras on her roof into my backyard and it's been like a legal i'm working with attorneys and so that's been something that's been going on for like a good year but she's moving, thank God, and so that's a stressor that will be. will start to you know dissipate but. It was one of those things being like wow I can't yeah I was just one more thing that just sucked you know energy out of me. I guess, I guess, the last thing has been you know just relationship and stuff and you know, trying to. I was I broke up with a partner in February before cove it happened so, then I have basically been."
298.0,Provider,In charge happy just. Training here with our health status on all of a sudden this training got downloaded and started going on me so go on.
18614.0,Patient,"where's this stuff around you know finding love and all in dating in cove ID and and or forced celibacy during coven which I leaned more that way because living with an elder who's. obese smoker diabetic or whatever, I felt a lot of moral obligation to keep them safe but then it was definitely also at a you know, a detriment. In terms of my ability to try to connect with people so um yeah. And yeah and just the whole I don't know dating in the queer world in portland is is an interesting thing so there's that yeah."
298.0,Provider,i'm sure this. I don't I don't know about it but i'm sure it is. um what are your coping skills like what calms you down.
18614.0,Patient,"So um. that's Another thing I mean some of my. Some of the things that I had relied on I haven't as much recently, so you said, do yoga and I had just bought like a year long unlimited pass to the place, I had like was using. Like before coven hit but haven't gone to a lot of in person stuff like do some at home, but it's harder for me to go through a full like hour hour and a half. I it's hard for me to stay focused and actually do it for that long. and and always seems to be interruptions from. friends who live in my house or the other house or George or my small dog or whatever, and so there's that um. I think the big thing that I do, which I think is a double edged sword is for me. Learning, it is a way it's a safe place for me. And it's something that brings me a lot of comfort and makes me feel productive, even if i'm not doing a whole lot, so I you know consume lots of. Science news and documentaries and things like that, if that's entirely a coping skill, but if that um and I did get into a bad habit which is better now, but at the. The last year of trump's presidency and during the election, I would like have to drink a bottle of wine or half a bottle of wine, while I was watching the news to get into really be able to digest that i'm not doing that quite as much now so that's good but but yeah. and Other things that I would like to do but haven't been as much are. Running I unfortunately this past year I broke my left foot and then later I sprained my right ankle really badly so i've been kind of not super mobile but running and that type in hiking and getting out into the woods, is a it's a coping mechanism. So yeah."
298.0,Provider,we're to spirituality.
18614.0,Patient,"um I was raised Catholic, but I would say that my at this point i'm more. I don't know if I will call myself Buddhist at this point, I definitely was much more into Buddhism in late high school through. college it's still informs a lot of how I think about the world and how I think about personal psychology and emotions um but i'd say that i'm probably kind of like agnostic. Like and I most of my friends there's some you know pagan ish stuff about you know the solstice and that type of stuff so I have been more involved in that type of stuff than I have been in the past but yeah."
298.0,Provider,"What are your strengths, what do you like about yourself."
18614.0,Patient,"um I am. i'm smart I am why i'm generous I. Truly care about the well being and welfare. of others i'm. i'm. Generally, a good communicator. I am. handsome I don't know what else, I can say, I mean those are those are, I think some things oh."
298.0,Provider,yeah do you have any military history.

298.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have access to guns, no. Have you ever attempted suicide."

298.0,Provider,Interesting happening medical mental health or addiction problems.
18614.0,Patient,"um yeah I would say she does but and she is weird I mean a little while back it's like it was some big revelation where she said i'm that she said i'm I have anxiety and depression and it was like. First off more than that, secondly, no shit and then third off the way that she's dealing with it is going to a support group at the local Catholic Church, instead of you know, getting a professional help but um but yeah and. I guess, I was talking with my brother and sister a little bit ago and I guess my mom as she's getting older, is getting very hoarder like."
298.0,Provider,A lot of hoarder sees.
18614.0,Patient,"And that she is starting to forget. Things but things that she should know, like my brother asking her something in her she's she is saying that she would have to ask her parents with her parents being dead for many decades, so that type of thing."
298.0,Provider,What mental health diagnosis is do you have that you know um.
18614.0,Patient,yeah so um I have been diagnosed with depression. ptsd and ADHD.
298.0,Provider,And the ADHD is that the inattentive type the hyperactive type or combined type.
18614.0,Patient,"So this is the other I got that diagnosis, in November, and then wasn't able to see my Kaiser psychiatrist until December 31, and so I haven't I don't know, I think that it's the inattentive type I don't feel i'm not hyperactive that's for sure, so I would say."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and can you share with me the type and the age of any abuse or trauma in your life don't go into details just tell me the type."
18614.0,Patient,"um i've had a. Okay, I mean physical abuse and. neglect and. And stuff I mean from since I could really remember. My or and or living. Where. We would need to be walking on eggshells and ready for my father to explode at any point so whether that or. verbal. That would. That was a constant thing so i've from when I can remember so from six or seven onward um. My mom. So my yeah my father dying, when I was 12 this trauma my mom at that point. what's funny is that she are not funny but she had she was really a my sort of main protector a when I was younger, but then after my father died. She and my father my we're in a we're in the process of getting divorced when he died, and he kind of put a lot of unresolved stuff on to me as a 1413 1415 year old, so I got. yeah so thrown out of the House multiple times, she had me arrested for malicious destruction of property, when I broke a coffee pot in an argument I was in juvenile detention for two weeks because. It was $50 bond but payable by parent only. and So there's that um the other a more recent. trauma, which I guess is like 10 years ago now, one more, but my first job coming out of college was working for the city councilor in portland. And he got caught up in a sex scandal and there was a speculation that there was inappropriate stuff with me, because I was younger, but had moved up from intern to assistant policy director to like the main person which wasn't true but was really devastating to me at the time and. being unemployed and having no income for half of the year in 2009 was also super traumatic I was not sure where I was going to be able to live. and yeah i'd say that those are some of the more."
298.0,Provider,Are you in any type of physical pain.
18614.0,Patient,i'm. This yeah I have back and neck issues pretty regularly.

And then so then after that I ended up getting a tin pan of plastic on my right year. That was caused because of advanced Gerd that I had, and so, when I was sleeping and horizontal the acid was like going up into my sinuses and stuff and causing issues. So I had a surgery for my Gerd because my lower esophageal sphincter just wasn't working um and then I had surgery on my left foot in like about 20 years ago when I because I broke my foot snowboarding i'm not good."

298.0,Provider,um how was your ability to focus and your short term and long term memory.
18614.0,Patient,"not great, and that is a that's one of the reasons why I am stressed at work i'm a project manager. But i've been i've never been great at remembering people's names, but now, especially that. i've been out of the office it's like if I haven't talked with someone and I don't see their face, I have a hard time remembering names even have like colleagues and co workers, which is weird um I. find myself. overwhelmed constantly and procrastinating because of that overwhelmed. And my. In addition to names I also you know forget details about stuff that are important for my work or or even in Community things like conversations that we had be like I don't remember this element of the conversation but i'm going to believe you like and yeah."
298.0,Provider,it's or anything i'm not asked her That would be good to know about you.
18614.0,Patient,"um I realized one other thing that i'll say is a stressor is. Like exits existential dread about climate change and or. Like losing democracy, like a those are things that I feel overwhelmed by and somewhat powerless about. And this is another that's another thing that um."
298.0,Provider,Any hallucinations or delusions. Have you had in the past. Any phobias.
18614.0,Patient,"A fear of abandonment, but that might be more an attachment thing then a true phobia."
298.0,Provider,yeah um how is your evening well we've already gone on how's your appetite. For sure it's. or your sleep habits.
18614.0,Patient,"Right now they're getting to be a little bit better, but I was having a lot of just disrupted sleep. The past couple months. Like waking up at 3am and not being able to really fall back asleep or. yeah that that type of thing mainly um but it's been a little it's been better, the last couple weeks i'd say."
298.0,Provider,Do you use any substances right now.
18614.0,Patient,"um yeah so I. I like smoke some pot, most of it is more CBD oriented because the the pot nowadays is just so strong it's um so there's that um. yeah I drink wine. that's really it."
298.0,Provider,Would you be available for a group on Thursday at 6pm.
18614.0,Patient,This.

18614.0,Patient,Are you talking about tomorrow or just in general.
298.0,Provider,in general. in life.
18614.0,Patient,I should be able to do that um yeah.
298.0,Provider,"So i'm going to have somebody call you on the phone and finish orientation, do you need refills on the world good trend or the Guan pissy."
18614.0,Patient,"Not right now, but I will so part of the reason why i've been anxious to see you is that the plan with my Kaiser psychiatry. was to start off with one for scene and then add something that was a more traditional ADHD drug I did sort of say that I was kind of reluctant to do anything that was too. I don't know i've seen some people who get burnt out off of like adderall and stuff so I have a little bit of an aversion to that um, but I am sure that there's also like dosage stuff and other things that went on there, but um. But that's something that basically it's I am wanting to be able to continue a little bit with some of that. treat course of treatment that got. Cut off because of a change of health insurance and also they're very long vacation."
298.0,Provider,"understood. So there's. This is a little education about that world of ADHD medication there's two sides there's the adderall side and there's the riddle inside adults, usually sparks. Usually fare well with the adderall side if you don't if you tolerate adderall we can go to a more expensive, one which would be by Vance if you have side effects like racing heart or. A restlessness that you get on the adderall then we flip over to the riddle inside if you tolerate the riddle inside, we can then go to concert up if you choose to go down a stimulant route."
18614.0,Patient,i'm just looking I don't think i'd ever heard of violence before by Vance so i'm just looking at.
298.0,Provider,what that is.
18614.0,Patient,"Okay it's a pro drug of the the infamy and deck so next row okay. um. Well, so you're saying that okay Ritalin would not be the I don't I don't want my preconceived like I don't want my prejudices like get in the way of what makes sense, but I also do. A little bit wary of the adderall but."
298.0,Provider,"understood, because people do happen can can form an addiction and then they want more and more and more, one of the things about our program is, as I see you so often that i'm keeping it a pretty close tab on what's going on and your side effects and adjust the dosages as. As needed but traditionally Ritalin is for children adderall is for adults traditional yeah."
18614.0,Patient,"Well i'll defer to you on that, then I mean if that's. I definitely also would like to start off with like a very low. dose which i'm sure that's know it. starts, but I mean."
298.0,Provider,"yeah and. Also i'm just thinking i'd like to check with my psychiatrist to because I kind of like to know what your psychiatry was thinking at starting new at two milligrams, and so I wanted, I just wanted him."
18614.0,Patient,"Oh, so the psychiatrist started me at one milligram and then one of my primary care doctor. They moved me to two milligrams. milligrams yeah."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, my email address, we can continue to have a little bit more discussion on the. stimulant is T Escobar which is T for tanya which is my first name and then Escobar."
18614.0,Patient,At bright heart health.com right.
298.0,Provider,"Yes, please."
18614.0,Patient,i've already got you in there.
298.0,Provider,"Wonderful. So. I i'm just going to check in with him first make sure that we can you know I don't I don't know what to do, as far as the Guan pacino do I add to it or do I stop that and start the other, I just want to check with him first if that's okay. And then i'll let you know okay yeah."
18614.0,Patient,The the Kaiser psychiatrist was saying that it would be additive but yeah definitely.
298.0,Provider,To have those cards yeah.
18614.0,Patient,"um do you want me to just shoot you an email, so you have mine right now okay."
298.0,Provider,"That would be great if you run into any problems sometimes the fastest way is to email me, and I can shoot it to the right person pretty quickly. i'm going to have a request that they contact you and get you scheduled for the rest of our program and i'll let them know that you have an outside therapist I need to go right now, it was a pleasure to meet you Berlin, which pronouns do you like, to be addressed by."
18614.0,Patient,A he had a them.
298.0,Provider,"All right, very nice to take."
18614.0,Patient,Thanks.
298.0,Provider,"He has a moderate low suicide level rest just because he attempted when they were little, but nothing now and mtd ptsd ADHD and attempt to. Stop."
