105.0,Provider,"he's not law. Job level. off to the upper right just draw the blog. And what it has and what you're going to be doing, and just write it down don't say it soon as you start talking other things happen, so I want you to write down the name you give it I don't care what it is. But what it does here is interrupt me. It has all the answers it's not interested in hearing what you have to say it's on interested in relationships. By all it does is say why why why. Why why."
2724.0,Patient,"Sorry i'm laughing at the picture, but okay. it's not working today."
105.0,Provider,"Just look at it. Look at it and hear what i'm saying. It is not you. Not you. it's a part of you that every single day attempts to manage you to prevent something from happening it's there to protect you. give it a name. I call it something but it's not enough that I call it something what it does, that I can see, is it analyzes. and tries to force the question why why why why that's it."
2724.0,Patient,I would call it the over analyst asshole yeah. Let.
105.0,Provider,me write it down.
2724.0,Patient,"And a list is that, like a white yeah yeah."
105.0,Provider,"So we've got this blob and I want you to look at it and see if you are able to share your gratitude to it so look at it don't look away look at it, it is not you. It is a part of you that got developed some. quite some time ago, once you just share out loud, I want to thank you for this. Finish that sentence, thank you."
2724.0,Patient,"I want to thank you for protecting me in certain situations, but I don't need you to be. corrupting my life, right now, I can understand and I realize when i'm in a bad situation I don't need you, putting me down all the time because. I didn't allow myself to the best situations, but now i'm not so, can you. take it away."
105.0,Provider,Wait.
2724.0,Patient,"I know I know I already knew as soon as I kept going, but I just that's. How I felt like just get away for me like i've gotten over a. heroin I got through everything leave me alone."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so just just stay there it's okay. leave me alone."
2724.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"we're gonna go with that. I want you to I know you want to go all these other. But look at. The over analyzer look at the block on the page. leave me alone and don't take your eyes off of it. This is a relationship that you have. And you don't get to be here with this very often so just stay there longer you can do it. I want you to look at the reaction of the over analyst when you said to it, leave me alone, just a short response, what does it do when you say leave me alone."
2724.0,Patient,angry.
105.0,Provider,"Okay stay there, look at it again look at its anger. Ask it what. Does anger do for us."

2724.0,Patient,What does your anger do for me.
105.0,Provider,and know you there's no way to do it that fast you didn't wait wait.
2724.0,Patient,"Like what is the point of your anger like. Just me putting in my own words, and I put it in my own words, am I allowed to do that."
105.0,Provider,I.
2724.0,Patient,am sorry sorry i'm getting irritated and that's not your fault. But know what is the anger doing for you. it's allowing me to not have to feel what I actually want to feel.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so stay there, stay there what's it like to hear that that is protecting you from this big overwhelming feeling and there it is it's. That one what is that it's going to be one word it'll be sad it'll be scared it'll be lonely. Good scare."
2724.0,Patient,yeah normally.
105.0,Provider,"Okay scared and lonely all right. oftentimes lonely the core emotion is sad okay. yeah okay. I want you to ask that part go look at that that blob again. Would it be okay, for even two or three minutes. If, when and I spend some time healing. The part you're protecting repeat that question and i'm happy to repeat it a few times for you to call."
2724.0,Patient,"Was Okay, when I spend some time healing. Without you there are. Some time."
105.0,Provider,that's good enough just look at the.
2724.0,Patient,does not kill me.

2724.0,Patient,you're letting it happen.
105.0,Provider,"you're doing. just fine. everything's right on time just the way it needs to be. One more conversation. I think you can do it now, do you know that it is safe here that you get to be irritated that there is a real respect, at least for me and there is a little from you to that it's there to keep you from feeling this overwhelming sadness. it's there to serve you. I don't hate it i'm not mad at it and i'm not offended by it. So come back. Let me be this family therapist inside of your mind, let me do internal family systems work so that you have. choice."
2724.0,Patient,"Just like I learned all this from you, and then I tried to. Teach my family and they just don't. care to take it in and just like actually be better people."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
2724.0,Patient,"This might be. Our third we should be working class at tiff have to take in school, it should be a frickin class."
105.0,Provider,I wholeheartedly agree. And you get to change a. generation. You get to change it. If you learn how to navigate your own mind. That will parallel in your life when you can manage this you're going to be able to interact with people differently you've got to be able to manage. Okay we're.
2724.0,Patient,"Doing. Okay, right here, I can still hear you, no matter what I always have my headphones and. She me I was a dork I don't want her out here with me, so I have to let her out here with. Sorry, I guess i'm just trying to get anything inside my stomach right now."

105.0,Provider,"OK so. You have a choice. There we go nice let's just do one conversation, you can do it, you can do this. You can borrow my confidence. That I can hold the sadness. The disappointment. Of that childhood experience I can do it."
2724.0,Patient,I wish you could take that off.
105.0,Provider,"Sure sure we do, but we can have that a transformative experience inside of you, we can do that, and we can begin, but first you got to be able to look at her kind of be able to look at that little one. And when when the word why pops up asked him to step back."
2724.0,Patient,I don't like having to look at that part of myself I don't like having to look at myself period. she's going to learn.
105.0,Provider,"she's that's Okay, I get it, and so I can't force it, but I can tell you a little bit about it, and I can say she's going to continue to threaten to overwhelm you with sad. If you don't listen to her and help her heal she's going to she's not going anywhere and you're going to go to why and to substance use. As what everybody does where they go to cutting or they go to overeating or they go to romantic relationships in fantasy let's take care of her I know we can heal her I know we can."
2724.0,Patient,"I keep ignoring her and that's why she keeps so maybe it's not a guy that little blogger, is the little girl."
105.0,Provider,"So you. know, let me, let me know."
2724.0,Patient,"No, no i'm wrong."
105.0,Provider,"Look at the page. that's not the little girl, that is, the protective part that showed up to take care of her. The little girl. I want you to draw her in the lower left part of this page a little something, it can be just a flower can be anything you want."
2724.0,Patient,I don't even know what I would draw besides a girl crying.
105.0,Provider,Lower left side.
2724.0,Patient,"Oh, my God I didn't know it again hold on."

2724.0,Patient,"Oh, my God. It just. makes me laugh because I. Just."
105.0,Provider,want to know what what i'm what my clients going through when was the last time you adjusted thc.
2724.0,Patient,Like nine o'clock last night.
105.0,Provider,"So I want you to ask the part that wants to use the giggle or the judge, I would like you to be polite and say you're getting in the way of this work."
2724.0,Patient,"yeah I noticed it a million times already, I know I noticed."
105.0,Provider,that's okay.
2724.0,Patient,I just I just. Just I just woke up right before therapy to so like i'm. waking up I finally just woke up one. Good.
105.0,Provider,Do you remember what I asked.
2724.0,Patient,"Yes, I did. Okay, you can't hard."
105.0,Provider,picture it for.
2724.0,Patient,For any of this over analysts. Bull crap in my head to walk away any of it just won't leave you won't doesn't want to.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Then let's do it this way let's not fight it we can't keep fighting we've got to be able to say instead turn to one of those parts I don't care which one it is. Okay, can you hear my voice i'm gonna i'm gonna."
2724.0,Patient,"yeah i'm listening to you, I heard everything you said it blew me i'm listening to you. I just don't want to hear it."
105.0,Provider,"Well we're going to change the question it's going to be how did you help me to cope at the time. How did you help me to cope at the time that this sadness started just look at the blog on the page and ask it how. How did you in your questioning your analysis, how did it help. me cope during that time and let's do nothing else, but that. Just ask. How did analyses oh."
2724.0,Patient,I don't all right words. One good thing to do this is making me go.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, well then i'm not going to argue with."
2724.0,Patient,Maybe letting me see the light and getting away from somebody that I shouldn't. I guess maybe I don't know.
105.0,Provider,i'm going to take a breath you're.
2724.0,Patient,On your own.
105.0,Provider,"just put your hand over your mouth for a second, you need to hear this. Your inability to inhibit. Speaking is getting in the way of your healing. it's both okay and inconvenient but that's also OK, but it's just you're not able to metabolize the medicine medicine is what i'm trying to dose to you you're not able to take it, because you're moving. metaphorically like this if i'm trying to dose like this you're in motion that's all not good not bad just aren't able to take the dose, this is the medicine, this is what I offer. and It can work. It really can. But you're the part of you that goes to summarizing for me. It. says starts running and moving it gets your mouth moving in articulating words faster than I can say to you. Ask that part and blend again and ask that for to England again it moves faster than I do, and i'm pretty quick, but I can't do it if you are right here in front of me I might have a little signal, I could do. But there's a lot more time that happens, through telemedicine, I can't do the same things as I would do if we were here together okay. So we thought we often talk over each other. And i'm not able to quickly intervene okay I just can't do it."
2724.0,Patient,i've always been bad.
105.0,Provider,"So, so you, you have one of those diagnosis of ADHD you probably do but that's not going to help us right now it's not going to help. You have been able to inhibit speaking that's the part, we need to say wait guys, I want to give this a fair shot, I want to look at this this part and when you take over you don't get me. It looks like this, this is what's happening in this in this world if I unblemished from this this analyst I can actually talk to it and understand it, but what happens to you. Is it literally takes over the whole meeting there's no relationship between, it is a demon possession, if you will, it possesses you and takes over. But what I keep doing is trying to say you have what it takes to say hold on, I want to know more about you, but i've got I can't I can't see you I can't know you if you don't step back to get that. You don't."
2724.0,Patient,know because it isn't. And that's what I feel so.
105.0,Provider,"And I was hoping and it might this might be and that's why, having something in writing would be helpful, it might mean that I need a puppet for you, it might. I don't know what it's going to take I don't. yeah it's funny."
2724.0,Patient,"Right, I was just a bunny did that ever. um I know I don't know what it's going to take, either because I can't get out of my own stupid ass mine i'm getting so so frustrated I feel so trapped that's why i've been going crazy the past few days, I just felt like i'm like. Like in this case. And you're going to know."
105.0,Provider,What you're going to get. Where you're going to feel you're going to feel like that tomorrow.
2724.0,Patient,you're wrong.
105.0,Provider,"same things that you've been doing until you do things differently, what i'm telling you is the mind. If you can. unblock from these parts you're going to have choice and freedom. And they will come all right back together you're not you're not going to become crazy you're going to become saying. you're going to feel. yeah so right now i'm fairly certain it might be unproductive so let's put a pin in it, but I want you to talk a little bit about what got in the way of the work today, I was trying to get you to have this conversation with different parts, what do you think got in the way."
2724.0,Patient,I didn't want to talk about it.
105.0,Provider,I don't want.
2724.0,Patient,"I don't want to do. I don't want to deal with it, I don't want to face it. And i'm having a hard time facing it because it just means I have to deal with so much more emotions i've already been freaking brilliant what so i'm like. All i'm doing is working working working on myself all the time that i'm still I don't want to add another freakin thing to the list like."
105.0,Provider,yeah I bet.
2724.0,Patient,"I just want to give up so bad, I want to give up. so bad that I know it's not worth it. was so bad."
105.0,Provider,And maybe there's a part that's just going to put. it's exhausting a call that's right and i'm not i'm not daunted I recognize what you're doing I recognize it and there's a way out. Okay. that's a permanent solution for something I happen to know.
2724.0,Patient,"is temporary, I would never ever ever have the courage, believe me, I. would never have the courage to laugh but. I want to, but I want. I think about everyone else around me and how much one was people that love me, so I would never do that."
105.0,Provider,let's stick with this.
2724.0,Patient,which I did want to make sure you know that you don't have to worry about me i'm OK. See super you ask yourself around and I stuck. Oh. And I keep blushing now.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, put your hand over your."
2724.0,Patient,"mouth you listen to me, Nicole."
105.0,Provider,"just put your hand over your mouth, it is really hard. Keep filling and. sweet sweet sweetheart there's nothing wrong with you. You are not going to find out that you are a bad person. I am 110% sure you're going to end up finding out, you are more brilliant and beautiful, then you have any idea and that actually is even scarier."
2724.0,Patient,If.
105.0,Provider,"I know you can do it, it is not going to be this thing that you're bad. That the outside world that's not true that's the burden. that's the lie.
