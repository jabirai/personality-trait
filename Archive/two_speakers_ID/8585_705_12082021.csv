8585.0,Patient,I don't.
705.0,Provider,"I think so um I want to say Leslie you and I did your initial braveheart health, where I asked you like the different questions and then I believe there you were in need of like the eating disorder program and you were referred, and then I think you did the assessment."
8585.0,Patient,So.
705.0,Provider,Okay yeah so it's good to see you again. yeah and I think that was last that was like in September so what's been going on since then.

705.0,Provider,You know Leslie. where we left off. And my thought and i'm getting some clarification on that too is that you were going to join the eating disorder Program.
8585.0,Patient,and
705.0,Provider,And you were going that route.
8585.0,Patient,"My there was something wrong with my insurance, so I didn't end up doing here."
705.0,Provider,"Is that something that's going to be resolved, where you can get the help you need what that also."
8585.0,Patient,"I don't think so like baby had me calling a bunch of numbers, and it was was alive."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm okay. yeah you know with with that Leslie is to me where we left it office that was the route, you were going to go and then usually with insurance you can't do both. They usually either insurance, you can do both or you can't do both it's kind of all over that and so. For me it's just like I wouldn't expect you then Leslie to to know that you and I were supposed to meet, because we were going in a different direction so i'm glad you know that you're here, it sounds like, then, that you would marry or back to working together. Okay."
8585.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Mary casner like you and her have been pretty much working, I think the whole time together. Okay okay well good well again i'm glad that you're here today and we'll see what we can do to get you going on some new treatment plan goals and go from there. hi, how is it to like. As far as groups, how are your groups."

705.0,Provider,"Okay, honey, I think you're in one of one of the few all them in groups, we have, which is great. Okay, so the group, then, is all women comfort level is a little bit better with it, how about topics are the topics you relate to."
8585.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so not anymore."
705.0,Provider,"Was there topics before that you related to a little bit more, and you felt you could you know talk about it and relate to some of the others."
8585.0,Patient,not really.
705.0,Provider,Okay. Do you wish that there was a different topic that you were talking about in groups.
8585.0,Patient,I think so.
705.0,Provider,"Sometimes, with groups to it takes, you know getting used to it and group dynamics can even change as group members change. If ever you do feel you know in group, like someone you connect with or they say something that you're like Oh, you know I relate. A lot of times like I know in some of the groups, I do people will exchange emails or phone numbers if you're comfortable you know, in the chat where you can directly chat with someone. Now. So, as far as then, like you said you hadn't been feeling well I do you mean was there, medical things that are going on health wise."
8585.0,Patient,"yeah I have to stop working for like two months, like, and it was like one thing after the other. So."
705.0,Provider,Okay. Have the medical issues been resolved.
8585.0,Patient,yeah yeah I started it will resolve last week and I started working again.
705.0,Provider,Oh wow house it back the House in the back at work.
8585.0,Patient,it's not it's nice at least i'm not home every day.
705.0,Provider,Well that's that's good that you're not home every day and to get you back into routine of like getting up getting out there. Mental health wise was it challenging why you were having health issues going on did that affect your mental health.
8585.0,Patient,"I feel like it made it better. For instance, I had a really severe allergic reaction. And like before they knew it was an allergic reaction they thought it was something else that was like really bad and I thought I was gonna die, and I feel like that was when I realized like I don't really want to die or be miserable. And it changed my perspective of everything."
705.0,Provider,"wow. Sorry, you had to go through that and the other end it's like you took the opportunity to really reflect and be like you know what I don't want to die, I want to live. hi so so the suicidal like wanting to harm yourself hasn't come back into your mind. New okay. Ah i'll sometimes those trials and tribulations is where we learn the most about ourselves, and have new discoveries. What are some of the things then Leslie as you were thinking about that you wanna you want to live and you want to be here in order to go with that."
8585.0,Patient,"i'm starting toy again. In January, and like i'm excited but I haven't been in school, since. The. Last year, since before summer when Kobe started and that's when I dropped out of college, I was going to say i'm going to restart everything all over and my Community college and i'm excited but i'm scared."
705.0,Provider,what's the fear based on.
8585.0,Patient,"When while the reason I had to drop out was because I was horribly like when I was in college, I was really depressed I didn't have any help I didn't I didn't know as bipolar back then, or anything."
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
8585.0,Patient,"And my grades I didn't go to class I couldn't focus, I can do anything, and now that i've kind of break like I feel like i've definitely gotten better mental health wise. But like i'm scared that it's gonna like my focus i'm not going to be able to like sit down and do my work and do the best I could, because I know like. My first year I did really good I had straight a's any I was able to concentrate and do everything, but I don't know if i'm still at that level again, if I can work. The best I can do."
705.0,Provider,"Now well you know now you have maybe something you didn't have back then, where you went through that period of time, and that you learn more about yourself and that you probably have picked up even more coping skills than what you had before. Ah. yeah you know, sometimes it's with with college to sometimes it's good to take a pause and then come back to it and go okay now i'm going to go into this like time management strategies trying to figure out like what's what's going to be your system, then. For time management. Like, how do you how do you keep track then Leslie of. Different events like today's appointments and other appointments you have."
8585.0,Patient,I have a calendar and I write it down.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
8585.0,Patient,"But I can only do it like if it's something small. But, and it took me a while to. get used to it. Like I first when I first started this program I kept on forgetting or sleeping through it and now like i've been consistent for a while."
705.0,Provider,"Good. Are you keeping track a calendar on your phone or like a handwritten okay. i'm old school I do I have over by my desk of paper one, and then I also reminders in my phone. But yours is working, where you're able to set notifications okay. So yeah you know with with coping strategies to is developing the systems like you were saying. to break it into smaller pieces, because sometimes it gets so overwhelming like going to class and how am I going to go to all these classes and how am I going to study and juggling personal life and work life and school life they all collide together and how to keep that balance. Any any thoughts, then on how you can so putting reminders on your phone is that going to include also your classes to remind you. yeah I cry. How about study time or how are you with that. Studying yeah to study, like, for your your different assignments, how do you go about making time to do homework."
8585.0,Patient,"boy so don't start something. like this, I tried starting this semester, and I only had one class. dropped it because I couldn't handle it and it was like it was when I was sick. uh huh so I didn't have time and then, even if I did have time I kept putting it off, so I don't want the same thing again scared because this time i'm having like classes."
705.0,Provider,"Okay well i'm glad we're talking about it now where you can start to develop what your system is going to look like and prepare for it. I know a lot of times with preparing for it, you know that that fear of the unknown so what's this going to be like and i've had this experience before where I had to drop, because things seem so chaotic. is putting it back into a system that's going to work for you Leslie sometimes, though, like you, and I can talk and explore that but you might need to fine tune it, you might need to make some other adjustments and to make it yours. Because I can give you examples of things that may work, but until you feel like hey I make a connection here, I can make this work. Then, then that's going to be different for you. So, with the classes and dedicating time to study one do you like one do you feel like you work best to study."
8585.0,Patient,know it yeah.
705.0,Provider,"i'll put it another way, are you a morning person, where you have more energy in the morning. Or, more energy in the night."
8585.0,Patient,None.
705.0,Provider,"No, no, no energy none."
8585.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm really I sleep a lot like I take at least two NAPs a day and I wake up late and I sleep kind of early. So, like a problem."
705.0,Provider,And that's another factor of okay factor this in when we're talking time management is fight factor this into that i'm taking more NAPs. Are you working with with Mary to kastner to get your medication where if you're sleeping too much that's not good if you're not sleeping enough that's not good either.
8585.0,Patient,"Okay, she had given me something to get more energy."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8585.0,Patient,"But my mom wouldn't Let me take it, because she thinks she like she handles on my medications and i've taken that one before, and she didn't like my rabbit my symptoms so she's not allowing it so we're currently working through that."
705.0,Provider,i'll cry do know like which medication we're talking about.
8585.0,Patient,yeah it was. I think it was an Anti. I will finish well you know. I think it was that one.
705.0,Provider,"yeah there is on your list of mad, so it looks like well you tryin tries it own. And you think it was maybe the wellbutrin okay. So where it is right now, as you and your mom you're not taking it yet and then having like her, are you trying to have a conversation with like that's something that you would like to take to see if it helps with managing the sleep. yeah i'll cry."
8585.0,Patient,And I let me have an appointment with Mary that my mom's gonna be there and i'm going to be mom doesn't speak English but i'm going to translate for her so but that's been like three weeks.
705.0,Provider,"Okay. you're in the group with Rebecca at 6pm is that the group you're in Leslie. yeah okay. she's trying to think too, because you know in group, how you can directly chat with Mary just to see like i'm wondering you just send out a chat to her like hey checking i'm still taking NAPs and if wellbutrin is the medication she believes that would give you the more energy. You know just if there's any other pointers she can give you until that meeting in three weeks."
8585.0,Patient,pointers.
705.0,Provider,"pointers like like suggestions, maybe to like is there anything else that's not prescribed like let's say something more. Like a B 12."
8585.0,Patient,I used to take that.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and you don't anymore."
8585.0,Patient,"i'm vegan I used to take it, but. It didn't really help like I used to take the when I was in high school I."
705.0,Provider,"Asked asked Mary caster about that Leslie if you feel comfortable just to see because be 12 is one that I know that several people are on and that sometimes it can help it just depends what's going on, but it can help a little bit with with energy for some people. And then that's more of a vitamin and then some places like whole foods, maybe even trader joe's because I always think of whole foods with some sometimes people nickname it whole paycheck. Because they're so expensive we're trader joe's sometimes we'll have more of that than natural product and even their vitamins sometimes will say vegan. You know just to give it maybe a go. Have have you seen at trader joe's where they have the different vitamins. yeah next time you're in check to see what their be 12 they even have one that dissolves I don't know if that one's vegan or not. To see quiet. yeah mary's great and, as you probably already know she has a wealth of information she's very knowledgeable and the more that she knows Leslie what's going on with you, the more that she can help you. and preparing for school, you know, having if you're taking NAPs several times a day, then it just is one more thing to factor in with your time it's like factoring work what's your work, work schedule like. wow and is that five days a week."
8585.0,Patient,No just for.
705.0,Provider,"Okay. Oh i'm could it be, though, if if you're working and you're having to get up that that much are you taking NAPs because you're just exhausted because you're you're waking up early."
8585.0,Patient,"You know, because even when I wasn't working when I had like the three two month break, I would still just sleep throughout the day. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah well you know and that's where if you're working you already know, the four days that you're working and then trying to set up a system for yourself to study. You know, like what do you think like what would be the best. Like non work days are in the evening."
8585.0,Patient,"yeah the middle of the day, I guess."
705.0,Provider,"wow so start start thinking about what kind of schedule, you might want to develop for yourself, where, then you know getting a plan can be helpful it usually will reduce anxiety symptoms, a little bit. It will make it go away, but it usually even if it's like out of 10 instead of a 10 maybe it will be a 9.50 it's like still it's reducing it a little bit. yeah yeah when you find out, then a little bit more of what your schedule and you know when you start taking classes. To getting that system down, we can definitely do that is there, then, while you're waiting to start school, I know you just got back to work, any issues with with going back to work."
8585.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm willing restless when I then when i'm there and I end up like leaving early and my mom gets mad, but like they let me leave. Fine, but. Since i'm supposed to work, the whole shift I end up leaving sometimes at 12 right too because, like I just I don't know why, but I just can't be there until six."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So, instead, the anxiety, do you know and sometimes it takes like time to start to recognize, can you identify is the anxiety based on people. Is."
8585.0,Patient,feeling like it's my so.
705.0,Provider,"Like internal dialogue going on, are you telling yourself stuff."
8585.0,Patient,"yeah like i'm constantly i'm just there alone on day like it's just me and my little area and I end up just thinking about the whole day and at some point i'm just like I can't work anymore, and I leave."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. What do you say, but before what are some of the thoughts that come in your head before you go into I can't work anymore I gotta get out of here."
8585.0,Patient,"i'm just looking at the time the whole time and I read I like split my shift into four parts, like my first my. Two hours before my break and then after break. uh huh and then after lunch from after lunch, and then the final break and that's how I go and it goes like there's I just completed one fourth of them and to for like that's the way I usually do it like split it up, but sometimes I just and."
705.0,Provider,"that's a good strategy, though, so you break it up where it's like I only have to make it through this quarter of it, I only have to make it through this quarter of it is after lunch, the most problematic for you, where you really want to leave."
8585.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,How lunch can be hard to are you do you eat and then start to get like a little bit sleepy.
8585.0,Patient,I don't usually eat.
705.0,Provider,"You don't eat lunch at all. Are you able to do anything as a snack like some type of like nuts, or something like that. Okay, all right, what are you eating throughout the day Leslie because that to can play a part, and not having energy."
8585.0,Patient,"at work, I whenever I work I usually. drink coffee morning with fruit, with a piece of fruit. And then I don't eat until I get home, which is. Which is until six."
705.0,Provider,"yeah with with having to an everyone's different, but with the metabolism, and with blood sugar levels, especially if you haven't eaten since breakfast and then you're not eating again till evening. That the blood sugar once it drops that that can already make you shaky and fill on edge and irritable."
8585.0,Patient,"I feel like it wasn't always like that, like I used to eat during lunch for energy there. yeah make me worse, they can feel sluggish."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it can do that too absolutely that's why I was wondering if it was more problematic that you want to leave because you eaten something really good and, sometimes, then the blood sugar is still adjusting and it can make you feel a little bit like tired. Where sometimes people will put a snack until they have lunch, you know, like a snack of something that can give them an energy boost so just some types of nuts are you allergic to anything like almonds or cashews or. Do you like things like that. No. And another one is sometimes even string cheese, do you like cheese products."
8585.0,Patient,And vegan.
705.0,Provider,"Okay that's right, you said you're vegan so what for for a snack, then that would make you too tired, but it would get some type of food and yo to produce a little bit of energy."
8585.0,Patient,and A lot. Whenever I want energy and I don't want to eat I just drink a much a lot.
705.0,Provider,that's has caffeine in it. yeah where it's giving you that a little bit of boost for the energy.
8585.0,Patient,Where I always feel better after I take it.
705.0,Provider,"Green tea is is good it's better than maybe some of the other caffeine it usually has a short term life, though, as you know that i'll give you the energy boost, but then, after a little bit of time it usually starts to to slip away. Are you considering I know before you're saying i've eaten and then that hasn't helped me and looking for you know you do the green tea and that helps you a bit it's just having something in between. Like considering something that you could have that maybe just to see if that helps you. Not i'm not willing to consider anything like that."
8585.0,Patient,"I feel like if I do eat eating too much, so I have."
705.0,Provider,What type of Milton are you having for dinner.
8585.0,Patient,Whatever my mommy. Like sometimes she does she work so she brings burrito. or something i'm not saying. i'm sorry.
705.0,Provider,"you'll have that for dinner. Okay, are you able to eat a full burrito. And nothing like you're not trying to stop yourself from having the full burrito. No okay. Alright, so it's just the lunchtime. With anxiety then to that you're like Okay, I want to leave. Before you're thinking you know you want to leave can you identify any other triggering thoughts."
8585.0,Patient,I feel like I have more stuff to do like I start thinking about things like do instead of work. spend time like I always bring a book to work.
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
8585.0,Patient,"And i'm I always try to read it, but I never do. I feel like that's another thing like I try to do things that will be more productive, or something and I don't even and if I do leave I don't even end up doing them so."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. It just makes it and it's it's like it develops a routine for you, then you get in the habit or routine of leaving work we're checking see then comes to play each day, where you're like I don't want to leave work. With and you end up saying i'm going to go do this and then you don't end up doing it. But the ritual comes back the next day. And on the other hand, now you're taking a book and that's a good coping strategy is to try to interject with the book instead to keep you there and to work through it. So you have the bucket work right. that's part of the action steps so it's like big when you took it to work now is implementing sitting through it and be able to to read. Do you think you could give it five minutes."
8585.0,Patient,i've tried like.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, you did."
8585.0,Patient,"yeah like even at home, I try to read like I have a lot of books and I used to be able to read a lot."
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
8585.0,Patient,But like I try and I just can't get into it. Like I end up forgetting everything that I just read or sits always I get really distracted.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. Is there an alternative to reading that would help manage and keep you at work. You try an alternative like music.
8585.0,Patient,we're not allowed to listen to music.
705.0,Provider,What would then fit within the guidelines.
8585.0,Patient,I don't think anything does like i'm supposed to be working the whole time.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so this this is in even a case where they're located book. yeah got it on clay. You enjoy where you work."
8585.0,Patient,And only three hours.
705.0,Provider,It can you can you control in how many hours that you work.
8585.0,Patient,Sometimes.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it's that circle of control of what we you know there's outside influences that sometimes can influence our decision there's no control over things like the weather and things like that. But those things that you do have control, such as if you can and ask for reduced hours or work it out or they're able to say yes, then then that's good when you work the reduced hours, do you make it through the whole day. And quiet. So part of it is the the hours part of it is just wanting to leave and go do something else. like this weird sometimes where it's then we want to be somewhere else, and then we get to that somewhere else, like home where we think we want to be, and then we're like where else can it be. More that underlining dissatisfied not filling at ease. The amount of hours to are you are you working at a set amount of hours because of like a budget like you have to pay so many bills, and this is a budget they're trying to stay within."
8585.0,Patient,I didn't pay besides my phone bill which my money pays for like most of it.
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
8585.0,Patient,"Like if I did have to pay rent as last year I was, I was supposed to feel about college and I ended up placing an apartment and I never left and I paid a whole year, so I had to work, but now I don't have to work or paint anything. i'm just trying to get the 40 hours. But I can."
705.0,Provider,"Is there an aspect of work that does get you out of the House, which then helps with your emotional and mental state."
8585.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
705.0,Provider,"Is there a part of work, though, that does help you like, now that you don't have to work, but you choose to when you leave the House and you get to leave the House like sometimes it just helps with your emotional mental state or you feel better, more in balance."
8585.0,Patient,"I feel like it helped me because I like shopping long so. Like I guess that's how i'll pay it and that's what I I think about what i'll be able to buy. Now, but it doesn't really. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"It can't on some days, though, because i'm like I think you're on the right track, trying to find that reward and it's like. The book isn't really doing it, you have the book and then the guidelines for your work sounds like they really want you to just be at work, doing role work stuff. But, to put it as like a reward like Okay, you know how you already coordinated it up like from this quarter, what can I buy from. This quarter, why can I buy like think what you can buy in a full day. To tapping into two different motivators like we all want motivators we all have you know, like you work we work everybody shows up to work because usually there's a paycheck or something like that, at the end. yeah. Are you with the holiday to is there. Are you more inclined to spin because there's so much advertisements and good deals. What do you like to spend your your money on."
8585.0,Patient,skin tears. Things for my room.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. How, and especially skincare and makeup Oh, that the prices on that. It is it's it's a great market is, I know, as women, we like are usually our makeup and our lotions and stuff like that. Do you find a product to that. You know that has like. Sometimes, with vegan I think it's just like no animal cruelty and things like that Okay, so you like things that are more pure."
8585.0,Patient,"Well, I don't."
705.0,Provider,care.
8585.0,Patient,Good yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Okay let's see seeing where your guidelines are. Okay. So, no, no, but no boundaries there with the with the makeup you're like it's Okay, whatever product is in there. Right. What is something, then that you feel is important to set as your treatment goal."
8585.0,Patient,"Like I do have an idea, but like I don't know how to put it into words."
705.0,Provider,If you can just try not to edit just say what you're thinking about. Having more energy and then something happened there was a beep can.
8585.0,Patient,"To be able to do what I wanted to. Okay, and see i'll do something like oh no for sure i'm going to do it okay."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that can be a mixture of things like tamp time management, it can be a mixture of to finding out, you know how to follow through if you make a plan with someone, what are the steps that you can do where it will ensure that you follow through and like you said say what you want to. Do what you say you're going to do. And I i'm glad that you're putting this out there because that's the first start. Is a lot of times is there can be no improvement in an area life if there's no problem that you're aware of, or you're willing to admit anyway it's like if there's no problem there's no problem. But now i'm hearing that this is something you want to work on, is when you say you're going to do something, you want to follow through with it. Okay. Well, and this is where we get creative then. So if you're wanting to follow through with something and I always look for when we set a goal with the you might have heard the acronym smart goals, where it's something that we can gauge progress by like you know how, how will you know, and you obtained the goal. When you follow through maybe or could it be the steps that lead up to it, breaking it into small chunks like you did with your work schedule here's a quarter to get through here's a quarter to get through. So and thinking outside the box then Lastly, what do you think, then, so the goal following through when you say you're going to do something to follow through. What are some small steps, of how we can gauge progress."
8585.0,Patient,Moving.
705.0,Provider,"i'm like sometimes a person may say, like i'm going to pick like one day out of the week, maybe i'm going to do, physical exercise for 10 minutes. And if you do more than the 10 minutes, then that's great you know you did more, and if you did that just one time, a week, but you decided to two times a week that's great so making it where it's more measurable. To track your progress with it so so what you're sharing is a little bit I know difference so that's why I say thinking outside of the box of what would measure your progress with following through with stuff that you say you want to do. yeah. You go ahead."
8585.0,Patient,"I already do that. Like a try, I have a habit that tracks it. Most of the thing i'm able to do. And then there's like two or three like."
705.0,Provider,"that's good he has an APP and you're also writing it down. Okay does one thing, do you tend to follow through better if you write it down or do you tend to."
8585.0,Patient,I write it down on.
705.0,Provider,"Okay. No old school stickies. Okay. So you write it down on the APP and then do you get reminders. And then, what do you do once the reminder goes off. You."
8585.0,Patient,"Sometimes I try to do it. I just say i'll do it tomorrow, and they don't do it."
705.0,Provider,"Okay. So there seems to be then in the system as a potential place to make an adjustment. So now you have like you already have to develop the action step, which is to set your phone for things that you want to follow through on and then you have an APP I think two is cozy another APP that I think i've seen for time management. I think there's an APP called. what's your APP called."
8585.0,Patient,tick tick.
705.0,Provider,wonder if that's the same thing because co Z is a family organization is Apps for family and usually you can coordinate it with other people scheduled to not just your own. How do you how do you spell the one that you're on.
8585.0,Patient,I think it's T I C K T ic K.
705.0,Provider,"yeah to do list checklist and task manager that sounds pretty cool. They say here in their ads that they organize everything in life, do you feel they fulfill that promise. Look. So great talks about reminders. So now, you have already this the Foundation it's like okay here's the reminders this is going to go off it's more of now, when it goes off what are you going to do with it. What would get him not to put it off till tomorrow. thanking. Because we know that procrastination usually ends up where where you're not able to follow through tomorrow right. Are you are you willing to try. Instead of maybe putting it off till tomorrow. Could you set another alarm and only postpone it for an hour. it's almost like you get a double chance you're doubling your odds of maybe following through. So the the APP, then you have it you're wanting to follow through on it that's the main goal and how to measure it is to you know see if you can do. If you can do it immediately then great if you're feeling the need to postpone postpone it for an hour and then, if you do it for you know after the hour and you do it. put a check, you know that's a big one for the day you did even small stuff small stuff that you can get and develop into a habit of following through is going to big build up to two when you're doing bigger stuff that you want to follow through with you know what I mean. How about like household stuff do you need reminders to do household stuff. Anything that you don't really need a reminder it's just your habit your daily routine."
8585.0,Patient,next thing I know it's for everything.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah visual aids to I was working with someone that just not only having no energy to brush your teeth, because sometimes, especially with depression just getting out of bed is a big win. But they actually were setting like different places at their house reminders by visual aids, so their their bed, you know they would set a plant, the plant had to be watered after the plant was watered and that would get them out of bed. Then they would set like toothbrush and toothpaste on the counter to remind them it's time to brush the teeth and then doing cues like that. So not saying you need a reminder to brush teeth and do hygiene all stuff, but could you use visual cues like that to to follow through."
8585.0,Patient,"kind of do like I am on pinterest i'll do like mood boards. How I will be here if I did that, for instance, like if I work out. Oh, like. I don't know like a. New tracker for Nick so. I have this thing, where I entered like these phases, while be a certain way, for instance um if I get up at five in the morning and like do everything I wanted to do on my to do list I get there's this thing. called the it girl, or you have in your life in order and I kind of get myself into that mentality that I do have in in order. yeah and do most of the things, there are certain things like like don't do, obviously, but like I feel like that's What helps me."
705.0,Provider,"i've any time any type of tool is like bring it in it's like an order to find what's going to work for you it's sometimes bringing everything in and ruling out rolling out gets you closer to what may work. So you already have like you're doing your own coping skills, I mean all this will be a support where it's just like okay supporting you and. When we check in that you can let me know if you had to make adjustments if there's anything else you know so now i'm hearing that you have more of. On pinterest it's a mood board like I to me i've seen where with exercise you're feeling maybe sad and you exercise, and then the mood can change to maybe satisfied or content, maybe it doesn't go to happy and you're jumping up and down because you worked out, but you feel calm. Now those are good ways, those are exactly what i'm talking about with with knowing yourself to some people are more like you have to hear things to kill you in like a song I had someone else taking their medication to Duran Duran has a song called like rx or something. I thought it was clever it's up, they would put it on the track every morning in their play tape or the playlist and that would go on, and it would be a prompter same thing, for your visual if you're more visual is to be able to do that. quite so now it's like a system it's like Okay, if you delay it by an hour and if you could do it in that hour than then great If not, then engaging to and maybe some of your mood charts where you put that and how would your mood to see if that can motivate you. Is exercise, something that you're you want to. Like maybe try them one day one day week."
8585.0,Patient,"i'll try. Like my mom bought me some like workout plan last year, and even though she bought it I didn't do it. I bought a yoga. monthly subscription and I paid it and I still didn't go. that's the thing I don't know like even paying for things I still want it doesn't guarantee anything like and I had a gym subscription to and I wouldn't go to. yeah and then like the even the APP that I use a tick tick At first I used to pay like there's a $2 subscription every month, if you want like additional things. And I paid it for a year before I even started using it."
705.0,Provider,"You know i'm going to pass along to if you don't mind that tick tick because I think it's a great APP and for people that are looking for strategies for time management perfect. Having some times, where, especially with losing focus or At first it sounds exciting and it's like and one of those impulsive buys where a gym membership is sounds great you know you're going to feel good. You buy it and then now it's the follow through it's the going and getting there that's challenging. Ah, so I like to support you know more of what are some things like sometimes if you could do low fee or no fee to start off with that with exercise and finding out what are you more prone to do like. Maybe yoga then isn't your thing, maybe you're not one that's going to go and pump some iron and be like hey, this is what i'm going to do. Maybe zumba classes for you, maybe it isn't maybe you like to stretch and start off that way go for a walk there's there's so many different ways that you can choose Leslie and you. You have to like I said get out there and explore a little bit more to find what's going to speak to you what's going to be like you know what I don't hate this I don't love it, but I don't hate it and so maybe this is something I can tap into. And that's where you know exploring that and so setting up that smart goal were exploring and and if you're up for it one time this week is explore for 10 minutes any exercise that you choose is that something that you could do. There is to tick tock there is YouTube everything you can think of, for you know, a 10 minute meditation martial arts what's that one called where there's lots of movement. types TAI TAI Chi I think. I think it's TAI Chi and you do different movements, but it's actually really good and you're focusing and it helps concentration, it is an exercise, you know. anything like that to try for 10 minutes just one time this week, if you want to do it more go for it. And then, let me know what what you decided on. And then I love your treatment plan goal to have working on, when you say you're going to do something following steps that can get you to fulfill what you want, what you want to do. As you go along, make it your own if you need to do you know, a certain part you need to switch up switch it up. You know it's creative time. meditation wasn't working for someone and they had a very strong spiritual sense, so they found a meditation that spoke more about spirituality and that worked for them. But they didn't know that first and they tried all kinds of meditation we would meet and they're like oh no I did not work. You know. So I think that that that will be good, and then you know, being able to share with with Mary directly chatting with her just what's going on with if it's too much sleep and what you're going through. And then do you feel Leslie comfortable translating for your mom. yeah Okay, if you feel ever that you would prefer to be more like have someone else translate and they could see to have someone else on the team. Could could be there to translate just giving you another option in the future. yeah i've had where sometimes I work with people that are like No, I do not want to i'm the one with a problem I don't want to be able to translate and others are like no it doesn't bother me, I can still get my needs met and do this other extra. So you're fluent in Spanish. yeah very cool. wow that's brain exercise right there. wow. Oh, I love studying in the brain and when I saw with one of the top ways to keep your brain Active and Healthy is learning a new language and speaking a different language. Because you're switching it all the time and it shows highlight in your brain activity or more, you know advanced than other people that don't speak more than one language. you're you're already up there, doing some physical cognitive exercises when you don't even know when you're translating. What else is there that we haven't talked about that you were thinking that you wanted to bring into today's session."
8585.0,Patient,I think that's it.
705.0,Provider,"It looks like to they have you scheduled again on the 22nd, which is a Wednesday at 5pm.

To keep it up and stay stay open minded. Alright well it's been a pleasure Leslie and I will see you soon. Okay, take care of you. And by.
