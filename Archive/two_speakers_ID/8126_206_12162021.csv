8126.0,Patient,"yeah as well as well i'll tell you know that's what I tell her all it's something I mean there's no way i've done i've tried it all my life to you know, to get straight and do you know and i'd never been allowed to say you know see but. But you know she's you know she's claim, you know she's she's in recovery and stuff too, you know but uh you know it's just like we were you know, work together, you know she she helps me, you know because i'm not used to all the technology in the credit cards and the bills and this man. And she's you know she takes care all that takes care of the House and this and that and and you know, and I try, you know she you know she's disable she she bring is she gets SSI and then that helps out a lot. But uh you know I tried them on that you know, so I try to make sure, everything else is covered in. My seems like we're."
206.0,Provider,about which I son and he goes.
8126.0,Patient,"Well that's well man early just talking about closing the like, even though i've been paying you know I laid on shouts poor anything since i've been out that's one of the things you know you know i'll make sure to pay every month, and you know, and also, you know. You know, every time i've seen you know buying clothes and minus in a you know I always you know, giving money and and stuff On top of that, you know. Given his grandma child support, and you know but uh the bands I got that means I got this new job and there i'm already getting letters and stuff saying that you know. That they want to deduct it from you know from my you know from our paycheck and isn't that like yeah."
206.0,Provider,"So, how was the possible being paid before then."
8126.0,Patient,"Well i'll pay, you know pay, you know pay it every month, you know."
206.0,Provider,paid directly to. Have that although the States.
8126.0,Patient,He goes to the state but.
206.0,Provider,But you have painted. them taking it directly from your paycheck.
8126.0,Patient,Right yeah so.
206.0,Provider,Why would they want to initiate that if you're. Paying it.
8126.0,Patient,I don't know unless they just want to see is yeah unless they just want to see how much how much how.
206.0,Provider,"Much you're making. Oh well, but when that happens, normally there's somebody it's with question a change. So i'm not sure why they all of the sudden you would. be an issue. So I would check with you know with child support and see. Why, you know the. person, if you pay the extra continue the way that unless somebody asks why it's a change."
8126.0,Patient,"Well that's the thing you know i'll pay it all the time and the thing of it is is like you know her uh you know his mother don't even having. And you know, in the end, the thing of it is is like she don't pay child support her grand to her mom you know um and she's got two other kids and you know. But uh you know i'm the only one out all of them that's paying child support, and it is it's cool like it's court ordered you know and they end a day for say you know they make sure you know and. I kind of thing you know you know I, I want to pay, you know I know there ain't it ain't that I wouldn't you know that I wouldn't pay child support. But I just don't think it's fair that it's not that they're so long to me about you know, making sure i'll pay in and this and that whenever i'm not even late or anything whenever the mother don't even have to pay, you know so."
206.0,Provider,"My thing is, if you pan it and you've been you know your. Regular we making those payments, so why would be a reason to make any changes right now. and, especially, you know just a new job you just started so was. Coming from."
8126.0,Patient,I don't know you see the thing of it is I haven't even mentioned that he mentioned to the Graham all that I got a new job.
206.0,Provider,"So yeah that's all I was trying to figure out why it would be. The job will be involved already unless it's something that's because it's I don't know because i'm not familiar with the process of child support, but I thought. Maybe somebody would have to request a change for them to kind of get the job for for for the payment to come out from your paycheck because."
8126.0,Patient,"As gods I mean Arizona, you know I you know I don't mind paying child support you know if they want to force force me to you know, keep paying more and more. i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm definitely going to request you know custody, you know I wanna you know. what's interesting because i'm not going to keep you know it's a you know i'm not going to keep painting, especially if they want to you know if they're not content with what i've been paying if they want me to keep me to keep paying more and more."
206.0,Provider,So don't have access on the way you should then yeah our.
8126.0,Patient,"So if they want to, they want to keep but uh they want to keep pushing your luck, we want to get more and more money out of me. Then we'll we'll go through the courts and and i'll get custody, I mean i'll get some cost at least. keep paying one more more for my son and why nobody else is paying shit and then may not even have have the right to pick him up."
206.0,Provider,"When when are you ready right that agree, because if your pain and you want to be involved, they should allow you to do that, and if they like said, if they want more and you feel that. you're able to provide some physical custody and you, you have a now you have a stable home environment you're working any judge will grant you, you know at least some type of visitation will eventually custody. So get going with that. Then, if you do have some custody Daniel you won't have to be, you know as much if he's on a on a."
8126.0,Patient,"New Right well and another thing was like it like whenever first Whenever she got whenever the grandma got you know temporary just even whenever they did eight kids moved in with her. kids they had said that you know. If I would stay if I will, if I can, if I can. Stay clean and you know for a year, you know the the I could get ma ma ma. back. You know, so I mean now I mean, as far as that goes i'll bang."
206.0,Provider,done that yeah.
8126.0,Patient,"You know, for over a year, so if they really they really want to keep pushing the cords i'll get close to me. I mean the close of the I mean, but I don't want to do that because I don't want a terror terrorism from his brother and a sister and I don't want it, but if they want to keep me if they want to keep pushing the cord. You know because I do want to see I do want to get started, seeing you know, seeing more of him, and everything anyway, but if they want to issue about get more and more money, did I want to push the issue about getting custody."
206.0,Provider,"But, would you want to keep them I don't know if that comes through so the decision would you want to keep them on a full time basis."
8126.0,Patient,"Well, you know. I wouldn't want to tearing tearing them apart from his brother and a sister. And i'm not trying to really take them from you know their grandma you know yeah or anything like that, but the thing of it is is you know I mean I you know I can take care of him, and you know and and you know, the only reason you know. he's not don't try to get full cost these because I know the situation and I wouldn't want to do that hurt her hand or. anybody else, but if they want to keep if they want to keep you know push niche new and make me, you know make me pay pay, and not even have any rights to him whatsoever, you know, then then we'll then then we'll then i'll get it now get some then i'll get some at least. visitation you know you know for the weekends or every other weekend or something again that way you know I can at least have some time that's."
206.0,Provider,"Why, you have some time, then you probably wouldn't have to pay as much for spending some time in your House. You know, maybe that's something eventually you can explore but um again. We still not sure where's that coming from and you said you know she doesn't even though that you have a new job, so I don't know what I will be heard, so we question any type of change, with the support. But in any event, if you feel that you know that they asking for something that you already providing I would try to find out why they want so i'm. kind of garnish your paycheck because those that happen when people are not paying so that's why i'm not sure why they even want to send you that to save to get for them to get the payment directly from you on your paycheck."
8126.0,Patient,You know and that's that's. The only time they're like whenever I got out like the only time that I was so cold lake was because I was doing it doing a bother mail and then they had got. delayed and then whenever I so when i'll pay the next one. And you know the it went it went for the month ahead.
206.0,Provider,And it's not i'm not. so sure that one month to then pay.
8126.0,Patient,"Right so so those friend is having for a couple months and I didn't even realize what was going on and they said, you know I didn't pay this mom I work, but why do they you know. They do you want to pay, you know one at the end of the month, and then get another one, you know I mean they just they trap me in the you know, because the the mail was running that ran a little late at one time and and and so instead of me, instead of applying the money for that month. They all kind of."
206.0,Provider,previous month and then we'll show you that. you'll be in one month. Right exactly so was that ever.
8126.0,Patient,"rectified yeah I had to pay, I had to pay I end up having to pay that almost $300 because for back back child support you know where. Where."
206.0,Provider,Oh wow.
8126.0,Patient,But uh but yeah I said but I paid it straighten it up right soon.
206.0,Provider,As i've.
8126.0,Patient,"found it out yeah it was bullshit but you know and and I told him, it was because they knew that that was that was you know. Because the mail, it was a day you know, a day or two late it, you know and and. Then, and then they get it, and then they they applied it to the multiple before and then so when i'll pay, you know pay the next month, thank you, it was on time, it was the day or said that I missed that month to or sorry."
206.0,Provider,"So now, how do you pay them do is it electronically."
8126.0,Patient,"Now, and now yeah now i'll just do it on a call you know what the cord a checking account. And I got. I got wrecked."
206.0,Provider,"yeah well you know. So then, in terms of like goes when it comes to that is it's been able to spend more time with your son. You like to see me to quit."
8126.0,Patient,"I mean I. mean i'm so busy I mean really if I could, if I could seem a pocket even seeing my real the weekend that would be you know you know a lot more than what I have been you know."
206.0,Provider,"I mean, so it starts at least maybe once a once a month and then every other weekend eventually to build up that."
8126.0,Patient,"mean because I mean. i've been out i've been out for almost a year and a half and i've got me to stay the night with this one time, and that was it okay."
206.0,Provider,"And and and fun that that i'm. From that time how was there, how will you do have you been communicating with them, and whether there was any concern after you spend the night with them, what did you notice any difference in terms of his behavior or any concerns with that without spending the night."
8126.0,Patient,"No he he had a blast he was comfortable I mean, and I would be you know there's you know he just. You know, he. He has you know, yes, sometimes yes nice accidents at night, and you know, and he told me before before you stay, you know yeah yeah I could tell that kind of embarrassing but. yeah but he didn't mind the tell me, you know any and he's like in any asked me he's like does she know like oh yeah but I, you know I used to do the same thing when I was young, you know, do you know and then."
206.0,Provider,Take them a little bit longer. And I. think that might have been one of the reason he didn't want to spend the night because of the accident.
8126.0,Patient,"That was one of the reasons is Graham oh hey you know used, but you know. He know he he's not comfortable around me about it, you know and and he you know, I think that was just more of an excuse for his grandma like keeping you know, keeping from you know you know from coming and staying. But uh, but I think i've kind of think the reason you know another part of the reason is the reason why that she went ahead and allow him to go and come and stay with me is because. She split her and her. husband split up with the grandpa. icon so I can't really believe that the grandpa was the main reason that they didn't morning to come and stay with me."
206.0,Provider,"It was you know that van Patten, one that."
8126.0,Patient,"Right, you know I cozy he'd been more more of a dad time you know there's all wife and I had. And I can't see I can't think they kind of had. held a little grudge and just didn't you know wanting it, you know and then ben's you know ben's they split up those it, you know they."
