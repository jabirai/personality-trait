748.0,Provider,Hello.
15859.0,Patient,i'm sorry it interrupted.
748.0,Provider,"said. I was just gonna say I couldn't hear you, but now I can. How are you."
15859.0,Patient,i'm better.
748.0,Provider,yeah tell me.
15859.0,Patient,"i'm well i'm. Like managing I guess like my depression all better and i'm doing things that. are bringing me like. Immediate satisfaction so or not so immediate, but like I started watering or a rose Bush in the front and taking care of it, and now it's blooming roses. wow yeah."
748.0,Provider,That is really being able to see the fruits of your Labor and the payoff of. Small action.
15859.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,creates big results. good for you. And I can see the joy it brings you.
15859.0,Patient,"yeah like I every time I I drive up i'm like oh look there's more roses, I told my husband looked like it's blooming. And my husband made a joke and he's all like the reason why it brings you so much joy because that rose plant almost died, like you, and like you're putting all that hard can you're changing."
748.0,Provider,A joke. metaphor.
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,i'm so glad he's so supportive. So I would love to hear more.
15859.0,Patient,"um well, I know, last month, or you know your schedule was pretty much full and stuff but I started work last week. or last week last month and I was super high on my anxiety, it was like trickling into everything else. Because I was going back into the space where i'm I mean it's the same floor, but not the same side, where I work where I was hospitalized so I had a lot of anxiety and just like. yeah mixed feelings and stuff so. um so I felt like a lot of my habits and stuff were starting to backslide into what I was previously before I attempted. So I I was getting frustrated with myself i'm like I don't want to be that person anymore, and here I am with my anxiety and I can't manage it. And so. My husband started noticing like hey what's wrong with you like, why are you acting this way towards me and i'm like i'm like it's my anxiety like i'm sorry like I i'm just trying to figure out like how to. better manage it so i'm not taking it out on everybody."
748.0,Provider,"That is really powerful that you're owning it and stating it for what it is, and you know internally you're not taking it out on people externally that's the result. But, but your awareness is changing."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"So let's talk a little about how the MIT and how the anxiety manifests, what are the symptoms water, I mean I know what a anxiety. yeah feels like. But just in terms of how it shows up for you, and what that does. On a moment to moment in day to day basis so that we can look at some intervention."
15859.0,Patient,"Okay um well I had home, what I would I noticed, because I am okay at work, but at home it's more like I start nitpicking a lot. Oh, this needs this needs to get done that needs to get done why haven't you done this head and I tell you to do this, like two days ago, why is this still not done like I start like doing."
748.0,Provider,"So so essentially what happens is that that the anxiety voice start seeking control outside of you. And if you can own that in the moment i'm I am what i'm going to do is i'm going to make some notes in your chart so that it's. Really keyed in how much work you're doing and. And really clear, as they do as they assess you know your compliance and all those pieces i'm just learning some of this. The capacity of some of these systems to support you. In in the background, as well as in the foreground so I just I don't want you to think i'm not paying attention to that. Okay, so. Then what i've got to do online I see to go, and so I really have to say that as challenging as it is for. your husband, I think the fact that you're owning, it must be a real gift chicken."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah you know, like if I guess some. Like Sometimes it is because I go overboard sometimes and so um and it's hard."
748.0,Provider,"What does that mean, what do you mean you go overboard."
15859.0,Patient,"Oh, like I start like I nitpick way too much like all day sometimes two days in a row, or three and then so he gets overwhelmed and and so now, but I do try to verbalize like hey it's i'm having a lot of anxiety I don't know what to do right now."
748.0,Provider,And you.
15859.0,Patient,"And, and so, then that's where he's like well I don't know what to do either i'm like well, I mean just be me alone, I guess, for a little bit like I don't know what to tell. And don't make comments that will like push you over you know, like or just do one thing, and maybe i'll back off, you know, like it's I don't know. Like just helped me out, and I feel bad because I feel like i'm putting a lot on him to because he's already watching the kids all day when I work and then all my days off i'm still asking him to help me with the kids because he needs a break, too. But I were both parents, though a nice just see it that way and, and right now I just need an extra. set of hands well like. Bigger so some stuff out."
748.0,Provider,"Well, of course, and and you are both parents and I know that you're you're definitely contributing as much as you possibly can. Under the circumstances, i'm not finding what i'm looking for so i'm coming back and just all make notes later. At I just want I want the team to see the the amount of work you're doing and how you're you're moving it forward so. Can you. share with him. Well, it sounds like you already have, because what I was going to say is, can you share with him how hard you're working on noticing and changing noticing and changing noticing and changing. In addition to practicing behaviors that have been a way that you've managed the anxiety that isn't healthy. But it was unconscious. In the past, and how long you did that probably. So you deserve so much acknowledgement for any little change that you're making. And you know, the fact that you need to help when you get home well that's part of being in a relationship, you know that that parenting takes both parents, even when one of the parents has been on all day, while the other ones that work, do you not do the same thing for him."
15859.0,Patient,yeah right. yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Of course, when he's not there you're on full time. And so it it, it is a two way street and. You know the the. The place, I want to really focus, though, is how much you are becoming aware of the role that the anxiety has played in behavior for you. And, and the important piece of that is you're not a bad person you're not a you're not a complainer you are an anxious you experienced severe anxiety. And, and one of the ways that you unconsciously tried to manage that is by controlling the outside world."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And it doesn't work it doesn't change the anxiety, but we don't know that when when it's unconscious. yeah so it's a it's a definite process."
15859.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,"yeah so letting yourself off the hook in and really. getting his buy in to know how much you're working. Okay, to notice what's going on inside before you react to it outside. When that happens, are there tools that you employ for the anxiety when you do notice."
15859.0,Patient,"um well I haven't been consistent, but I really do try to do breathing exercises. Like that's the easiest one like I don't have to think i'll have to do is just like oh i'm starting to feel this way, let me breathe. And that that actually helped me out a lot in the beginning, is just like like I said, like i'm backsliding a little bit not being consistent so i'm trying to go back to the basics."
748.0,Provider,"Good and and your your criticism of yourself is really apparent i'm backsliding i'm not doing it as well that's because we have an expectation that it should already be done. We have the internal perfectionism. That says, I should already be healed I share, I already know how to do this, I should already be doing it like, and so I shouldn't need to be focusing on it or doing these tools and it's not it's that critical inner voice that's so good at its job that it's silent. Right. yeah now that it's in there shredding us into little pieces sometimes. yeah but that that those practices will be really helpful for you. So okay yeah the breathing the you know, and maybe having your husband. Maybe you could come up with a. What do I want to call it like a communication that isn't about him criticizing you even though he's going through feeling criticized right which is hard. But instead of getting angry at you repeat could say something like oh that hurts or. Oh. i'm really doing my best, you know, in other words make it about him, instead of about about what you're doing wrong. Okay, does that make sense."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I used to do that to him when. He would say things that weren't very nice. or things that I don't agree with him and and I would get upset and then I would I started using that to where it's like oh i'm just having some feelings about what you said, but i'm owning those feelings and i'm going to figure out what to do with them."
748.0,Provider,"wow that's powerful. seen you model that. yeah and so he could say something similar like Oh, that really that really hurt when. When you said that or i'm feeling attacked right now, rather than supported in how hard i'm trying to work. or. What are even checking in with you what's going on for you right. And that one's much harder, because when we're triggered because somebody criticize, so I don't expect them to be able to do them. When we're triggered because we feel criticized all you do is lash out we don't want to support the other person necessarily because it's that small part of US that's getting triggered not our oh so very loving compassionate parts."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah and and I think like because or there have been times, where like he's told me like you know I do a lot to like you know gotta just chill a little bit and then. And then I just go off and i'm just like I do like to come home from work i'm doing all this and that and and it's just like now we're just battle it's a battle of like who does more. yeah after that point and it's just like. I just need to stop."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and one of the things you could each do is start instead of saying I do this, and while I do so much to you could both start to say i'm really tired. And yeah the other one would say yeah i'm really tired too and it's not about a comparison about who's the most. yeah both doing some much I mean being a parent and working is very challenging, it is very challenging and being acknowledged for that if you can each start to acknowledge yourselves, for all that you're doing as well as each other. Okay really you saying wow JESSICA I you are doing a phenomenal job Look how hard you worked in the last three days going to work doing. caretaking for the kids taking care of the rosebush. cleaning the House making food. It The list is endless. The list is endless."
15859.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,"You know, really, giving yourself credit."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah, I think, because I know, like, for my husband like his I know the way he feels love is words of affirmation so for him when I started attacking him it's like you know verbally it's it's like like I don't love him anymore. yeah."
748.0,Provider,"So that's the other one is being able to say, I really liked your i'm sorry i'm so tired."
15859.0,Patient,yeah or angry.
748.0,Provider,"or angry. Exactly exactly. Well, tell me about work tell me about what's going on for you."
15859.0,Patient,"Okay, so um the first couple of weeks or ships, I was a little high anxiety at work. um. So I found out that a couple of my co workers already knew what happened, what happened with me. So I was like you know, like i'm just gonna leave it alone will not say anything you know just be like i'm fine i'm okay i'm getting the help that I need so like. As I just left it like that, and then um. So I told my manager like if there was any way I can go part time or you know just won't you know temporarily but um she was trying to figure that out, for me, and then I find out that i'm actually presenting a new Grad. So then i'm like you know, maybe i'll do that, because then that'll like. Keep me from. You know, like that it'll take some of the load of work off of me it'll be less stressful it's it's a different kind of stress, for me, though, I had to make sure like i'm teaching her the right. Things and, like the our proper protocols and procedures and stuff like that, but she's doing I feel like confident in her and she's pretty smart. So she's actually done a lot in one week with me and then the monitor it was even impressed like hey you're already making her call doctors like, why are you cracking the whip honor. jokingly you know, and so, so that kind of like made me feel better like okay so then i'm doing okay i'm doing the right thing with her. yeah."
748.0,Provider,you're able to give yourself some credit.
15859.0,Patient,that's fabulous yeah. So I can.
748.0,Provider,Go ahead.
15859.0,Patient,"I was gonna say so, like any little like. Tasks like that I know that she needs all of our practice on because it's hard to come by I have her do it like hey come on this change this dressing let's do the wound care for this person or because sometimes those are so hard to come by when you're new Grad. And there's so far in between that that was she won't be surprised once she has to do it on her own."
748.0,Provider,yeah that's great. So you're really seeing some possibilities for supporting her and learning things that she may not get enough practice in if you don't do that that's wonderful. And I hear you giving yourself some credit.
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,Really fabulous.
15859.0,Patient,"I think it's easier for me at work, I don't know like anything I don't know what it is like at work, I feel like I can I can do that more easily than I can, in my own personal life. So. True yeah."
748.0,Provider,Because it's for someone else.
15859.0,Patient,mm hmm. yeah that's true yeah.
748.0,Provider,"it's employer or it's for the person you're helping or yeah. No and doing it for ourselves, we put that on the back burner for two or two."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"So, good for you, for noticing that. really incredible accomplishments and again, you know I I really love the metaphor of the rosebush you're you probably don't see how big what you're doing is because you're just pouring a little bit of water on yourself each day."
15859.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Right you're growing as a result that's no big deal I just got a glass with a half a cup of water and dumped it on me, I mean that's kind of how we minimize what we've done. yeah five bear is the other reality, which is to remember that that half a cup of water reached days important like putting you last is not acceptable. Because you'll weather and disappear again and then it'll suddenly be if it isn't sudden, but it will suddenly feel as though you are in a place of being despondent again. Because there hasn't been the self care and self awareness that you deserve."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah and. Like I know, like the days that are really hard for me. Like I had like one really hard day before I started work and I just felt like everything was coming down on me again and I just. I just took the whole day i'll you know what I just can't deal with anything i'm just going to sleep i'm just gonna stay in bed like I couldn't I couldn't deal with anything."
748.0,Provider,wow how was that day.
15859.0,Patient,"And it turned out better. My husband was like Okay, you know, like I don't know I don't even remember what it what happened i'm pretty sure we were arguing about something and then so my husband was like well you know what let's go out and eat. So that's how he gets me with food."
748.0,Provider,"Well, if it helps it else right. And sometimes it's getting out of the environment and doing something different, you did it with him, and it was not work related like you didn't go run errands you. actually went out nate."
15859.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,Which is lovely. small steps.
15859.0,Patient,"And then i'm gonna say. I know, like yesterday we watched a video on. Oh, is it oh. On the anxiety and how it manifests like in our body and everything and what really like I don't know like it really resonated with me with it, like the flight fight and flight response. has been on for so long that we don't know like how to turn it off for maintenance because we're always like expecting the worst you know and i'm like that is exactly what's going on and then these I think gum. got the name and I think is now you Shia the other therapists that runs that group, she was saying that it could be anything like your parents always arguing. When you were little and you always heard that and i'm like well that's what I went through like that's true, and so, then now i'm kind of noticing like okay I don't want this for my kids. And I keep saying I like. I don't want to pass down that like I can't, this is why it's so much work for me right now, because, like that's all I know, like that's all I. Like. i've never known like how to manage it, or how to like. How to address it in a healthy way I should say. So that's why I am. I think that's why i'm so hard on myself to you because i'm trying to do it for my kids and they kind of want them to see me like break down or do the wrong thing or go back to my habits."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and what is that bringing up for you, I can tell it's bringing up."
15859.0,Patient,A little it's cuz. I wish I had known this sooner or I don't know like you know I maybe I would have gone through what I went through.
748.0,Provider,"We don't know what we don't know until we know it. Right, I know. That sounds ridiculous, but it is so so important you, through your family didn't teach you any of that. And one of the gifts that has always resonated with me, and I say this, often because it is so important, and when I say I say this often I it feels like I say this to almost every person. In indigenous cultures indigenous groups that have been very closely connected to the earth than to tradition and culture, far more than we are in this culture. There is the belief, and this is not just in one place, but in it's been documented that there are different indigenous cultures throughout the world that have this belief, when we heal ourselves. And you're the first person in your family system to have done this work right. Think about how important that is when we do this work we heal seven generations forward. that's your giving."
15859.0,Patient,Okay. that's good. Huge yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And you know. Even know your. Lack of having known that or known, there was a different way and tell it almost destroyed you. impacted other people. The bigger gift the bigger impact is that it happened that way and you're doing something about it. Do you know how many people continue to blame their circumstances and their environment and never make changes themselves. And therefore, continue to pass on a legacy of trauma. and violence and criticism and all of the things that you were given in your legacy. So when you look in the mirror later today, this is really. When you look in the mirror later today, I really want you to look in your own eyes and say. you're amazing for what you're giving your kids. As well as what you're giving yourself."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,So much courage to do the work you're doing.
15859.0,Patient,"Because it's not easy, like you know going digging and just like oh my gosh is like a cat."
748.0,Provider,yeah. i'd love to do you know the name of that video.
15859.0,Patient,"um I think it's on it's on YouTube and it's called therapy, in a nutshell it's like a three part series. Okay, and there are so many note taker so. Give us a. Little note um. yeah I didn't write the name of it, but I know the name of the person who did it, it was called therapy, in a nutshell. Okay, and it's like a three part video."
748.0,Provider,sounds like it's really good.
15859.0,Patient,"yeah that one really um. Because it it because, like i'm very. Like. Like I like to relate things to like how I do my things at work. Because are married like medical oriented and stuff like that so for them to explain it and how like the nervous system is affected, and how it affects like even your eating habits and stuff like that it. made everything click in I was like Oh, you know, like. I didn't think that was me but i'm seeing and it's been explained to me um so now it's like Okay, I get it so not only can I help myself like but i'm seeing it well, maybe I can help people around me to. You know, like at work or like my patients or like even my own family members that are kind of like not doing so well."
748.0,Provider,Absolutely. Absolutely. yeah out huge the gift healing is the gift of healing our own healing is to the world. Because you are passing it on in every moment of your life and and yet the expectation is that will do it perfectly.
15859.0,Patient,"yeah cuz, we have to set that we're seeing and tell us what you just said."
748.0,Provider,"Like Look how much you're it's like you just looked through the wind a different window, at the same room and went oh that's a different view of it. Like you're giving gifts to so many while also giving a gift to yourself in terms of peeling and committing to improving your. it's easy to say, improving your life but it's really improving your entire state of be. yeah and and healing that that. I don't know if this will make sense, but it sounds like it will sort of cemented pattern of anxiety like anxiety gets get so locked in ourselves as a way of being in the world and responding i'm not leaning away from you i'm leaning down to pet my dog social stuff whining. I promise i'm here 100% yeah. But but yeah I mean it's so habituated. And it's it's like walking right when you stand up in the morning to go walk into the kitchen or walk across the room to get your bathrobe or whatever it is that you do. You don't consciously think Okay, I need to move my left leg first and put it on the floor and then i'll move my right leg and i'll put both feet now it's completely unconscious and it's a it's muscle memory. And it's. Practice over and over and that's exactly what anxiety is anxiety was a survival strategy, when you want to say."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and i'm and i'm starting to realize that more now that i'm like doing the groups and i'm like I said, like that book that i'm reading in um it doesn't talk about you know anxiety or anything like that, but it's, just like the habit of. Like these things that i'm doing and how to break them and how am I to make me more aware of the thing that I want to break so now i'm. Like i'm trying to finish the book, so that I can really work on it in practice the things that i'm it's adjusting I just want to have, like all the information and tools, before I put it into practice."
748.0,Provider,"Again, because."
15859.0,Patient,Atomic habits.
748.0,Provider,games helmet cam.
15859.0,Patient,yeah James.
748.0,Provider,"gonna say, are you reading atomic habits. Yes, I read that. that's amazing. yeah yeah it is yeah it's quite a powerful and it is it's 1% a day. Now you're reading that book, you know that's true that real change doesn't happen with big huge change because we don't Keep it up. It happens 1% behavior change a day. And yet. You beat yourself up because you didn't do it perfectly with your husband. After how long has it been."
15859.0,Patient,I know you like my whole life. Like 35 so. Exactly yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And you know, and you were taught all these lies not because your parents are bad people or your family's bad, but because that's what they knew."
15859.0,Patient,that's all.
748.0,Provider,They were surviving.
15859.0,Patient,and
748.0,Provider,So you're unlearning as well as learning.
15859.0,Patient,"yeah and that's the we just said right now is also in the video that I watched the other day, and it, they were saying that you. You pass it's like you pass them their genes of trauma. So the way that you raise your kids you're passing it down because you're passing down. same trauma to them, even though they didn't go through it, but you're passing it down and it's just like Oh, my goodness, like no I don't want that, for my girls."
748.0,Provider,"No, no. you're. Awareness of fat is such a gift to them."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,Awareness is such a gift to them.
15859.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,"And they have no idea, right now, and they can't know you know."
15859.0,Patient,I mean.
748.0,Provider,"You can't say it in words, for two reasons, one is that puts it on them."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"The other is they wouldn't know what you were talking about. yeah but, but yet your actions speak volumes. It makes me curious a little bit about your husband is he seeing how this applies to him."
15859.0,Patient,"um I don't know honestly like because. I mean he's been there for me through like the past it's going to be 10 years now in June so he's been through a lot with me he's he's done a lot for me. So for him it's like he's tapped out with a lot of things like patience, or even i'm like trying to be. more supportive, because he has his own all things he's going through so because, even tells me like I have nobody to support me either like I can't go to my parents, because they're dealing with my. my brother that's what he says, my brother in law, so he is yeah um and so he's like I don't know who to go to like I don't even have like friends either so and I tell him will. Maybe you should see a therapist where you're comfortable with and I will make that effort to give you that time. So that you have somebody to talk to you because, like, I see how it benefits me, maybe it'll benefit you or if you don't want to do that why don't you do a workout like I know how much that helped him working out and so i'm like. will give each other, a time you do an hour and then later on all do an hour or whatever you works for you, because you could do that could be our thing to do together. And then. We help each other. But he's very he's a little stubborn."
748.0,Provider,"Well, so am I. yeah well yeah good for you, for acknowledging that and and you know he it sounds to me as though he has perceived himself as having the job of being the fixer and supporter, rather than a human being, who has their own issues. Exactly."
15859.0,Patient,"so nicely hit, and the more you."
748.0,Provider,"work you do, and the more responsibility you take, for your own experience them just so you know, the more his issues are going to come to the surface. yeah because there's going to be more space and. You know that the gift is that you can share with them that you'll be there. yeah you'll be there, while he does his work and, while that stuff starts to come up and. And you can share that journey begin."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah and and that's kind of like what I want for him to because, like, I see how much it hurts him to and like how the. I guess like his anxiety and everything that's coming it starts bubbling up and I I see how it manifests like tell him okay go take a timeout like all take over from here like I see you're not in the. Right headspace and I don't want you to explode so just go in the room chill out and i'll just take over from here that's beautiful, so I I try, you know, but there are times, where we're both in the same headspace or like oh."
748.0,Provider,"yeah I was, I was in speaker meeting many years ago, in a 12 step group, where the. speaker had been around it was such a good speaker and one of the things he said was my wife and I have been married, I think it was like 42 years, and the only reason we're still here is because our worst days haven't been on the same day. Well, we have our worst days on different days we have bad days together, but our worst days are on different days. And that's true, I mean we're all doing the very best we can, some of us have so little awareness and so little capacity for awareness. And that's an important distinction it isn't a choice to not be aware there's no capacity for it because of the mental health status or whatever the situation may be. But we're all doing the best I can."
15859.0,Patient,"yeah and and I think one of the things that he tells me is that sometimes i'm very selfish that i'm not i'm. Thinking about other people and how they might make them feel about like the things that I say, are the things that I do or the things that I want and I tell him. You know yeah that's true I might be a little selfish, but I have to be at this time, because if I don't take care of myself, who will. If I don't put the burden and the work on myself man, are you going to do it for me like how am I supposed to learn, if I don't. put myself first on certain things and i'm not it's like i'm not trying to neglect anybody it's just that i'm I need the time I need the help right now, because I can't do it by myself completely on certain things."
748.0,Provider,"You know and we're human we're not supposed to do a buyer so the nature of being human is that we are Community oriented beings, we need each other it's why we're very favorite quote from. I attributed it for years to this person that was a mentor in my life, but I found out it actually came from an organization he had worked with for years, but anyway, the saying is we alone can do it, but we can't do it alone. I think that is so powerful we've got to make the choice and it's courageous what you've done. To make the choice to heal and change, but you can't do it in a vacuum you've got to have the support of other people, and sometimes when we're first on that path, it is, it looks very selfish because there's not much room for anything else."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"But eventually it becomes the most giving. People who do their own work, become the most giving in the most service oriented so it's a contradiction in a way. But. What courage you just are really is moving today."
15859.0,Patient,and
748.0,Provider,"Just that the the courage, the commitment that that effort, like the daily attention you're putting on up."
15859.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Is it is it says so much about you and i'm sure some of it comes from having been scared enough to know that change was the only way out, but I i'm here to tell you, after a lot of years of doing this work, not everybody is able to make that shift."
15859.0,Patient,So okay. yeah.
748.0,Provider,"yeah. Yes, do you watch any youtube's of your own or healing sorts of things."
15859.0,Patient,"um I was starting to watch um Jay shetty for a while, but then I even got his book. um. yeah so um but then I kind of stopped, but i'm thinking about like now that I saw that therapy, in a nutshell, maybe i'll start looking through some of their videos that they've made and maybe I can start picking up some other stuff there on my own."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and I was thinking along the lines of. Things that you might do that involve other people tell me a little bit I know we're almost at it yeah we've only got about three minutes and tell me a little bit about your family of origin, what was present in the family, you grew up with."
15859.0,Patient,"um well my dad wasn't around too much. up in till he was like in and out of it was five and then or four remember now and. Sometimes, he would stay with those sometimes he wouldn't but he was mostly with my grandparents or his parents and so, then the days of he would be there, it would be nothing but arguing okay. there's been times, where COPs were called I remember one time I got was trying to get into the House, and he put a knife under the door. i'm one time he hit my mom so hard that like she fainted and he made me get the ice because I thought she was dead."
748.0,Provider,sweet.
15859.0,Patient,"And, and so he made me get the ice to wake her up and then. One time it was just like stuff like it was really bad and then, once. I guess my mom was trying to reconcile and trying to be like keep the family together so when I was 10 he he came back, but every weekend, it was an argument because of my grandparents, there were my grandmother on. His mom was like very manipulative. So that that was a lot of that and then my brother, just like. there's a lot going on with him too and. You know. He went through a lot, but I saw a lot more stuff than he did."
748.0,Provider,"So you carry the whole thing the reason i'm asking is, of course I care, and I want to know. The history was like but also you know I I love to look at what long term, you can do to continue to support yourself once you're not as involved with bright heart health whether that's a year from now, or whatever it might be. And one of the things that and I don't I didn't hear anything about addiction, yet, but that may have been present to you haha."
15859.0,Patient,My mother. Okay alcohol.
748.0,Provider,"All right, all right, so there i'm sure you've heard of a. There it's hard to be on the planet, not hear about a. And 12 step programs have grown as a result of a so so much there are hundreds of programs now, but one that I really thought I heard would be good for you is adult children of alcoholism another dysfunction."
15859.0,Patient,Oh.
748.0,Provider,"And it's called ACTA, and there are meetings all over the world and 90% of them are on zoom right now. Okay, so you can find a meeting almost any time of day, any day of the week, and yes it's based on the 12 steps, but the literature is phenomenal. And you can keep doing the work for years, I mean years and it's such a supportive environment and you're so open that I can really imagine you doing I I can imagine you thriving in that environment and I don't say that to everybody. Because so resistant. But, and next time we might even talk about how your husband might again may never be willing to do a group but. But anyway, that's something i'd love to talk about again and if I forget please feel free to remind me."
