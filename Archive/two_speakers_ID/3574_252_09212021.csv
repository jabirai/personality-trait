252.0,Provider,Are you.
3574.0,Patient,"Oh i'm doing good i'm. physically I just i'm kind of the because of. I think the methadone is finally like catching up with me like even though i'm doing blind dosing and I don't know when they take me down I think it's starting to kind of I don't know I haven't been feeling good lately, and it just kind of. I don't know how to explain it kind of just like flu like symptoms and I just feel kind of tired all the time and. it's not every day, though, so. yeah yeah and they said that's kind of to be expected, but. yeah so but it's nothing like terrible I don't i'm not like throwing up or anything like that so. Okay, and I don't have cravings it's just kind of. yeah I don't know it might be in my head, but I don't know when they take me down, so I think that's the point of that. yeah but um yeah. yeah and i'm going down pretty slow but I told them I didn't want to go down like super super slow so. yeah i'm not sure how much they're taking me down since they're not allowed to like tell me anything about. That, I think it's not more than five milligrams like at a time per. A week or two weeks or something to that effect not sure. But yeah other than that, though. My dad came into town yesterday and got to spend time with him. And so that was good. He was only here for a couple hours, though, so he had to go into San Jose to go work on Friday at the apple place. though he had been in town or been somewhat near me. But um yeah other than that i've been good."
252.0,Provider,Good.
3574.0,Patient,yeah better than the times before. yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,So it's good how's your job going.
3574.0,Patient,"um it's you know I only work three days a week, and. It was it for a while there, it was getting pretty stressful just because of the. A lot of people left for school, and so we had a shortage, but we just hired a whole bunch of people so it's kind of you know. Not as crazy anymore so yeah it's getting better. yeah but."
252.0,Provider,how's your recovery.
3574.0,Patient,My recovery oh good I mean i'm. Clean I haven't had any cravings or anything like that. My counselor at the new clinic is really nice. I see her every Wednesday when I go there and yeah. that's good can't say yeah yeah pretty much the same that it's been yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Have you engaged in any other. Groups, or in other meetings or anything."
3574.0,Patient,"um no they don't have and where I live, they don't have a whole bunch of those I think they have like one, a meeting but. i've never really liked the 12 step kind of. thing so that's why I wanted to see the counselor that I see because I could choose to just see her for once a month, but I kind of told her that i'd like to see here once a week instead because I thought they might have group stuff there because that the. One of the methadone clinics that I went to they had groups there for people that kind of didn't. gel with the 12 step program and that's kind of the group that I liked because yeah but they don't have anything like that invoice hell, unfortunately, so and it's an hour away so that would be. yeah hard to go to you. But um yeah. I wish they had other stuff here but it's such a small town that I was surprised, they had, I mean they don't have any na meetings that I mean yeah so."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you can do any of that any one that you want that you want to engage in online, you know."
3574.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,So don't forget that have you met any friends have you.
3574.0,Patient,"i'm. not really know um. I guess people out there's someone out work that i've been getting along with, and she invited me to hang out with her for Halloween and stuff like that so yeah we have a lot of the same interest and she lives in ukiah, though, which is about 45 minute drive. that's where original stories and she used to be the manager at that. coffee shop, but she or could this one now so. yeah it's just kind of a long way, but I mean it's something."

3574.0,Patient,"i'm not very long, we got to go out to. breakfast and then we went to the record store and then we went to the apple store. And unfortunately he had to drive back to temecula which was eight hours away so I only saw him for about four or five hours, but he's coming up next month, so we can spend like the weekend together so."
252.0,Provider,Oh good good good.
3574.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. that's and he said, we talked about you know Christmas and thanksgiving. Well, was that."
252.0,Provider,I was to say how are things going with him and his girlfriend and they moved in together.
3574.0,Patient,"yeah they did um he said that she's mostly focused on her mom because, like her mom's pretty much dying I guess i'm not really clear on. Why they think that I mean she's old she's really old but um she was in the hospital for a bit, and they were just. You know, he he keeps telling me like Oh, it could be any day now and then like you know oh she's doing better and i'm just like I don't know what's going on with that so but um. He was telling me that you know she's finally gotten her pension and you know is paying her own bills i'm like well that's good guess but. yeah whatever. yeah so I haven't really talked to her and I don't really I don't know I didn't know how to broach the subject because sometimes you know he's not always faithful to her so sometimes I wonder if, like maybe. I don't know he has a lot of contacts in San Jose where his apple like was so. I don't know, but he didn't say too much about it so that's where I was kind of like. I didn't want to push it so. not my business."
252.0,Provider,You know. Is he's is he been sober.
3574.0,Patient,"No, no yeah That was something we talked about I was like so how's the drinking and. He said he was drinking just enough and. I don't even know what to make about that. yeah so yeah and I was like is soo drinking and he was like yeah I was just like a."
252.0,Provider,He won't stop you know.
3574.0,Patient,"yeah me too, but he said he was like oh i'm thinking about cutting back, and I was like yeah i've heard that one before but. You know okay yeah I was like well i'm not hung over like that's okay."
252.0,Provider,yeah okay.
3574.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know yeah so I don't know how much he's drinking just because you know. But he has to for his autoimmune disease, he has to be giving infusions and so i'm just wondering like. What his doctors say about that or if he even tells them that you know he's drinking that much because I can't be good for that, but."
252.0,Provider,Not at all well. you're not worried about him too much at this point.
3574.0,Patient,"I mean yeah I am but i'm. i'm. Just. I don't see him as much, so I don't know exactly what's going on, so I guess. Whenever I was there, like, I saw how much juice drinking so. I don't know I would think that not knowing would make me more. scared but yeah I mean he seems to be doing OK so. My arm."
252.0,Provider,"You know how. yeah how are you handling it, you know."
3574.0,Patient,"yeah no I I think he's doing okay I just again I don't really know the situation, so I. I hope he's you know, taking it down a notch. cuz yeah but. He said that you know he wants to see me more and he's. I mean he's been calling me more often than he was because for a while there, I was just kind of like I didn't hear from him at all so. yeah it's gotten better with the Community communication because yeah I think his girlfriend was kind of I don't know she's very controlling and just like I think she almost gets jealous if he pays too much attention to me. You know, which is a whole different thing in itself that went on the entire time I was there, but. yeah she's focusing on her her mom so. yeah she wasn't calling a million times or doing anything of that annoying stuff so that was good it."
252.0,Provider,was good good.
3574.0,Patient,"yeah, not that I want grandma to be sick or anything you know, because that sucks but you know they're finally because the last time I saw them they weren't letting her take tylenol or ibuprofen I was like. she's in pain and they were like yeah but we're giving her week dummies I was like. What and they're like yeah because I mean they. They found out that she had taken like a whole bottle of tylenol over like four days, but it was because they let her having she was having memory problems, but you know that doesn't mean completely cut her off that just means like give it to her every. Six date hour when she you know, is in pain, not just like cut her off and think that lead dummies is going to do it like. yeah because the doctor Finally, my dad. I asked him about it because, like that really irked me whenever I was still living with them, because you could tell she was in pain, I was like what the Fuck is going on, you know, like. I was just because you know we'd go me speaking only go so far, like this poor woman is like sick and old.
