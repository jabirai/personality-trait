11621.0,Patient,"What do you mean. Where you're right yeah like. i'm waking up at like three o'clock in the morning, my bones are just to the bone and i've lost a lot of weight, which me that's good i'm drinking a lot of water, but I am. I just wanted to ask you as possible, if I could up my milligrams from I used to be on 12 and then I went down to eight, but that was when I was a couch potato 50 pounds heavier not doing anything just stay on the SOFA not leaving my house at all."
298.0,Provider,Would you like to go to 12 milligrams.
11621.0,Patient,"I would. And that it would really help me, and I know that we don't have a lot of time and I know that group is like the same, and I know I can't talk about medicine at anyway, because I heard. Say do listen, I heard you say that, like two weeks ago, so I worked really hard and did everything I was supposed to to get back in green because I really It makes me uncomfortable like if there's a problem I like to make sure that things that I need to do, I do you know so."
298.0,Provider,"I know you do. I know I do I have learned that about you, you are, you want to do the right thing."
11621.0,Patient,"too, I really do and. I just feel like, if I could. I know it would help, I know that it was because. I don't usually let my mind wander think about like heavier things are like possibilities or trouble or that kind of thing, but like when i'm. In pain at 3am you know your mind wanders and it's like, no, no, I really want to stay my mom is so proud of me and i'm helping my sister but it's just like. it's really wiping the out, and I was talking to my husband and I was just like crying and he's like well you don't want to. lose this opportunity and he's working on selling house and joining me so it's not like a thing that I can wherever I am i'm going to have this condition i'm I accept it, you know and i'm just really glad that there's something that I can use that will help you know. And there is a. vitamin nutrition like office in our area that my sister and I were thinking about after Christmas like when we get our bonuses like checking it out and and and getting some like really medical grade vitamins. Vitamins units, you know, like be 12 shot or. Those kinds of things so. i'm it's just. I have to wait till I can pay for it, because it's not like you can use your insurance for something like that it's like something that you'd like a spa day."
298.0,Provider,"You know, half yeah."
11621.0,Patient,"I think that I would I enjoy that I just. Like everything else is good i've cut down on the gap in which my husband is glad that I did that so that part is good and numb. And I haven't had coffee, maybe like one or two cups like for tree like some Saturday morning when we were going to go like for shop look be looking for shops, or something like that, but. For the most part i'm just like herbal tea and really good water that they get from this like water company that makes really healthy water so i'm trying to. Make the right changes and Quito that I don't know where you went chantelle hold on my phone is acting up on me and I don't know why. Why is it doing that don't hang up on me, are you there."

11621.0,Patient,"I dropped it like when I was on the plane coming out here the stewardess of front of me stood in front of me when I was holding my phone. Because I was in the lane right next to the exit door and she dropped the buckle that she was doing the demonstration right on my phone. It didn't crack it right, then, but then the second that I did drop it like even a little bit on the carpet shattered my phone I need to get that fixed too so. And my husband's working on getting me a vehicle, so you know it's all in the works it's just waiting, you know hurry up and wait to get there, other than that and. And I just know that we have to have a one on one appointment in order to talk about medication you and other than that I just. Did really."
