13799.0,Patient,"Okay, I want to make sure that, and you guys are saying something about less surveys, starting in January."
724.0,Provider,"yeah there's a. yeah they're going to revamp the the process. To potentially like surveys, need to be completed twice a month or once a month, depending on like what you're standing is in the program of. Whether or not, that means that you're going to have to do. Like a bunch of those days. Where you know you're just making up for the ones that you. That we would have had to do a weekly i'm not entirely sure I haven't got through the rest of that training. seminar thing yet, but."
13799.0,Patient,Can we do as many inches.
724.0,Provider,"Not about yeah yeah i'm not sure I just know the days off about 10 minutes into like a half hour lecture about it. So what I got from it so far is that. You know if you're seeing weekly you'll have surveys do by the first and the 15th and if you're bi weekly as far as like like groups go where you show up every other week like twice a month, it was a set that your surveys done by the first. far as volume goes i've got it i'm not totally sure, yet I haven't gotten that far in the lecture so."
13799.0,Patient,"And i've been been keeping up on all of those and I did the drug screening. send me a boxing and i'm going to elaborate thing. You know where i'm at with all of that. Anyway, you can check."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean half the time the system doesn't update for like seven days, and I mean it's all based on. ones and zeros."
13799.0,Patient,"Because I know I fell behind their first, second, when I was all messed up with. providers and stuff like came over here."
724.0,Provider,kind of. Out of the green.
13799.0,Patient,"i'm, at least in the yellow."
724.0,Provider,"Well, it shows red, because your surveys are outdated, but if you just did surveys."
13799.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,The most recent ones that I got is from 12 nine.
13799.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah I just didn't know her.
13799.0,Patient,name but I. Think I did a Monday.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it could be. could be a little bit before they have to. Okay that's typically the way that goes, which you like, the biggest things really the key people like like in the green of their compliance is making sure that the surveys are done on time. which, for some people like like the used to be like. Do it before group, but then. That can be a pitfall to for sometimes because people are busy you know before the group, so I used to tell them to do it on Sunday night like pick a night before the upcoming week to get it all done all. The other thing is it and it's going to make sure you show for your appointments. And then the toxicology screen every month."
13799.0,Patient,"Those, like the the big three sticking point so to keep you like in compliance."
724.0,Provider,yeah so yeah technically in the yellow.
13799.0,Patient,"um and then also I don't know if I talk to you or shontelle I tried talking shauntel once and she said to go through the virtual clinic there but. Like i've been without my staffers for like two months now, and I keep calling are going on here to the. Virtual clinic and they keep putting notes in there, I need an authorization from the clinic in order for the pharmacy to actually build my login anxiety medication and it's been like two months.

And all they need is someone to send authorization to fill it. i've been contacting the clinic like every fucking week over it. And the first one was the same issue, and then schonfeld had to fill began in the pharmacy school and fill it until they get that and then starting it really fun annoying.
