You kind of go what could I have done differently, I don't know there's anything you could do different and but I don't dwell on it. So I mean the dwelling park was brief. A year maybe I don't know. How long you grieve over something like that, but. yeah from time to time it hits the nerves sometimes you know. never gets touched with the thinking about it yeah."
498.0,Provider,and Have you ever experienced any panic attacks.
17721.0,Patient,"Suppose what that they didn't last very long and. I had taken I don't know is. Is it was the drug is a lorazepam. So. I. was prescribed like six of those pills, and when I. felt well the last couple times that those three years ago, I had I had I take it up one of those pills when I felt really the anxiety and helps but I haven't had anything like that happen in a long time. Well, you know. Being like a year. A year ago, maybe it was well. I don't know it's been a while, since that has happened."
498.0,Provider,You can you wear any glasses for any contacts.
17721.0,Patient,"I do wear glasses that's a funny you say that. i've had 2020 vision perfect vision, all my life. And, about a year ago. I noticed that in about a month or two my eyesight was. Going terribly. I mean really terrible so I want to have my eyes checked and. They prescribed me glasses I couldn't see far away, I could see up close but I couldn't see far away. and So that was like six months ago, well, I just went back to the doctor last month, because I think I thought my eyes my eyes were getting worse, I couldn't see things that I should be seeing out of my devices that I just got six months ago. And yes, they were getting they have gotten worse, like, I guess, I have a couple cataracts. In my eyes. And they've been progressing so I got a new prescription and the doctor said that's not normal for cataracts to activate that fast, you know progress that fast, so I do have a new prescription lead got a month ago and i'm i'm seeing just fine you know. But I can sense that there. I have, I think I have good days and bad days, maybe. I don't know that's. But I definitely I definitely can tell it some stuff is getting blurrier again. And so that's you know well, so when I stopped. So my heart was in recently in a fib for over a year and. I didn't really I didn't know that because. Until I went to the doctor, you know. And they noticed that I was while I was in the hospital for a broken foot and that's when they realized, I was an atheist. And I didn't really do much about it, and until my regular doctor said, you know you gotta go see the cardiologist and while you're at it, why don't you go see the kidney doctor as well. So yes, my heart was in a fib they wanted to do a Cardio Graham what's you know, use the paddles to jumpstart your heart to get back into rhythm. You know what i'm talking about. Okay, so and I was just I was afraid of that scared me to death, and so I kept putting that appointment off and putting it off as. Well, so this is after I quit drinking. And so, a few months ago I went back to the doctor. The cardiologist and he says out miraculously. your hearts back in rhythm. And he said, what do you been doing different, and I said, well, I don't know but I stopped drinking a nice little one maybe that's it, you know, whatever you're doing keep doing it. And I haven't gone back into a fib in the last four months, and then, when I saw the kidney doctor, he was said the same thing that your your kidneys are failing. A normal person your age should have at least 70% kidney function and yours are about 20%, this is about the same time, a heart went back into rhythm. And the kidney guy goes just a couple months ago, right after I saw the cardiologist he says hey your kidney functions back up nice I don't understand that, because. kidneys are kind of like when you lose the function it's kind of like brain cells you don't get them back and he said it was very unusual that my you know my kidneys were working as well as they seem to be. So I next month, I do have another appointment with them it's been four months. Okay they'll do would be four months and then he I have another you know, a couple of blood tests and then to find out if you know if in fact. My kidneys you're either working or you know failing or whatnot. So when I stopped this drinking thing all these things started to go at right my heart back in a my my heart back and rhythm my kidneys are functioning well i'm sleeping better. eating better. So. The I yeah all these. Good things are happening to me, since then."

498.0,Provider,Do you have any allergies.
17721.0,Patient,"I do not. So. What. What my goal is through this meeting thing is. So i'm on food stamps I get calfresh and I have medical. Because I disabled and I don't work anymore. And I have been trying to apply for social security disability. So, through the social services department. We used to before this covert crap happen. If you applied for GA. And were trying to apply for. Social security disability they would help you. More or less. You know, like face to face get you into an appointment helping you physically fill out the full application and or not forms to get on social security well i've applied twice, you know, years ago, and I was denied, and so I you know finally. got on the GA last year general assistance and they they were two forms for my doctor to fill out one for my primary physician and then because of. When I mentioned that I was taking wellbutrin they said, well, we need to have you psychologically. evaluated, so there was a blue form and the two papers that I needed to get filled out for the general assistance well. it's this covert thing happened. You can't get in there not accepting any new patients for to be psychiatrically evaluated, I have been for the last four months. back and forth by insurance company with social services they hooked me up with. How I got to you guys was through oh gosh what. It was a firm that was dealt with. I can't remember what it's called now. But it was a. This firm that helped you. To try to find somebody to get your paperwork filled out. From a qualified physicians well, so this is. The zoom thing was a part of it, they said. Well, the people that i've talked to up to this point, telling me that, yes, we can help you with that, so I tried to get on this your zoom deal I missed the first two appointments, which was a couple of months ago it's probably noted in your notes somewhere. But I wasn't. I wasn't educated enough how to actually get the zoom. You know. To get it done and this guy Lawrence a month ago stayed on the phone with me for oh I don't know the better part of probably two hours to get me all situated about getting this appointment with you. So. It is that. You know crazy by any means, this whole thing of i'm trying to get. Is all over getting this evaluation form filled out so that I can complete my application for general assistance, and then they can help me apply for SSI."
498.0,Provider,um okay. First question. what's your email address.
17721.0,Patient,My email addresses all i'll let me get something to wet my whistle. So it's Johnny lemons J O H and N y. l E m m. A n n. At icloud. So it should be. Two ends and Johnny two m's in one man and two ends at the end else.
498.0,Provider,got it.
17721.0,Patient,"Okay, great."
498.0,Provider,The reason I asked you for your email addresses because i'm going to ask our request that someone from case management reaches out to you in order to retrieve the evaluation form. My only concern is that i'm not sure that that's something that. We. could complete for you today because you're just presenting today and.
17721.0,Patient,I understand that. You know i'm sure it's a process.
498.0,Provider,Not only that. There may be. kind of have a follow up question to that because you're a real beaten you've been on wellbutrin for two years under the guidance of your primary care provider was your primary care provider not able to complete that form for you as well.
17721.0,Patient,"Well, she did her part and in the form that she made you filled out which basically was telling the department that I am physically disabled you know not able to work anymore."
498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17721.0,Patient,"And so the other form and i'm gonna i'm gonna pull it out, right now, and tell you what it what it actually says at. The top of this, page so it's. It is called. it's called a mental health. Oh, let me see. it's called a mental health confidential report. And this is through Social Services Agency. So, my primary care doctor couldn't fill this part out because she's not a psychiatrist. or psychologist. So. You know and it's just has a few questions on both sides of this paper. But in order for me to continue with this GA and or. Help getting the SSI I need this this form filled out. So, like I said, these this group that I will got the number I got this number from I don't just calling. The places that I was referred to this agency I can't remember what they're called at the moment, but they helped me get you know get in touch with you guys."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so. i'm actually in the process right now of. reaching out to case management with regard to how do we move forward best. You know, regards to resolving this issue for you. Okay, you should expect to hear from either Nicole or on meal. We go."
17721.0,Patient,Okay i'm gonna write that down Nicole and. Nicole and well how do you spell the other name.
498.0,Provider,O m. n.
17721.0,Patient,e l okay amil. Okay. All right.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so to understand you correctly, you are currently with a provider that's managing. Your depression, which sounds like it's in remission and because, based on the characteristics that you denied your medication the wellbutrin that you're taking a stable you're tolerating it well it's working fine for you, you simply just need to get this form completed Is that correct. Exactly."
17721.0,Patient,"You know, to tell you the truth. I don't know whether I need this wellbutrin or not I just been taking it because i've been taking it for so long. For you know about five about five years and. You know they raised the dosage to I was taking 200 milligrams. Up until a couple years ago where they just. I was taking other stuff till for my cholesterol a pill for my upset stomach you know, a pill for this, the facts. And you know, on top of motoring for my back or night and. So my my care provider just said, you know what we really don't need this one we don't need this one more. And you know it's up to you whether you want to take to continue with the future they're not. At that point, she said, you know you could you could cut that in half and take only one pill a day, instead of to build a day, so I just continued to do that."
498.0,Provider,And well i'm sending the email now. Let me ask you an additional question and I apologize. For a little questions. Do you have any interest in. Continuing with the program with regard to therapy or anything of that nature or would you just like to have your documentation.
17721.0,Patient,"yeah basically. ability yeah but, basically, I just like to get my paper sign and and move along with this, because you know I don't have any income. Okay yeah and physically i've been disabled, so I was 40 years old. Okay, so okay."
498.0,Provider,"I just wanted to ask that question, so that I could determine next steps so typically what we would do is have a care navigator join us, but instead of doing that. i'm going to inform the care navigator of your wishes, with regard to request of the documentation and not proceeding forward with the program as a whole i've already made the inquiry with regard to case management. For regarding the documentation and you should. Nicole or on Neil directly. i've provided the email Johnny with two n's lemon with two m's and two n's. icloud COM warn them of the information the documentation that you're seeking to have. completed, along with your direct contact information, so you should hear from them. If you do not hear anything from them within the next three days typically once i've made a request, they reach out to you, within the next day or so it's Tuesday, if you haven't heard anything by Friday feel free to just call back into the virtual clinic and make an inquiry. Based on. My request okay."
17721.0,Patient,yeah okay.
498.0,Provider,it's Dominique. domini yes.
17721.0,Patient,Okay i'll write that down to.
498.0,Provider,"Okay. Very good, and, beyond that, because you're not interested in moving forward with the program and you do have a prescriber in. I would, if you have any additional questions for me i'm more than happy to answer them, but other than that I believe have at least addressed your primary concern for today."
17721.0,Patient,yeah. No you're totally have. You been most helpful and informational. And so don't get me wrong if I need to. divide it if if I need to continue with some other you know.
498.0,Provider,Try that yeah.
17721.0,Patient,To get this to to get what i'm initially trying to get done.
498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17721.0,Patient,"I don't have a problem with that. Okay right I i'm a good guy i'm. just trying to do whatever it takes. You know, I was I guess thrown a curveball with this psychiatric evaluation form so. I think it was gonna be this big of an issue what it happened was."
498.0,Provider,"That never seems like it's going to be that, and then you look back and it's taking."
17721.0,Patient,"Much right since the covert thing so they're not accepting any new. yeah patience, you know and the lady that I was talking to over the phone. She quit the Agency. So when she quit that automatically threw me out of the Program. So that I had to apply again. As a new patient. so to speak, which it, which now i'm. You know, four months later. And finally, finally, finally got Ahold of. You and. Actually, you know i'm getting closer to the end results, in other words. So, thank you very much."
498.0,Provider,"We can yeah absolutely. I have any problems with that and. i'm just letting me and i'm just letting that can ever get us know that currently. You, for now, you would What would the program but should you need to in order to buy some requirement that you'll be flexible enough. At that time, but. If you're experiencing a financial strain and this documentation is necessary for that it so that you can afford the program as a whole, then i'm interested in supporting you at least where we can and allow you to make that decision at a later date okay. Okay okay. Fantastic absolutely um is there anything else, I can address for you at this time."
