Some i'm feeling like a loser, because you know all this time I still haven't got five months clean, you know it's like the debt dad's winning why it's taking so long, you know."
724.0,Provider,"All these things, these things take time and, unfortunately. Time is a little slow when you're looking forward to it. So you really do going to take it like a single day, at a time, I know it's a cliche that they use on recovery, but. There is important it's just it's a model that you should live by day to day basis. Because tomorrow is not guaranteed so just do the best that you can for today and then tomorrow wake up do it again and just keep doing it, and eventually you'll be able to look back in and count your time but don't. don't get hung up on. numbers."
10859.0,Patient,"You know I mean they're just numbers is the dad I haven't talked to my daughter for a couple days now, just because i'm so depressed every time I call her she's want to talk to me where she just wants to see me in person. So it's like I."
724.0,Provider,like this.
10859.0,Patient,"Oh yeah we do that all the time, but. She doesn't want to talk to me, sometimes. For me, I know why because she shuts down, you know she rather see person it's been like two years now i'm not good. At 7am to go down there but i'm going to not give up on that you know."

I don't know I hate to not want to just leave because I gotta be prepared right like just part of me wants to, though, because I know i'd be happy to be doing everything right, you know, and I have a plan not."
724.0,Provider,"it's it would be slightly impulsive you know. Would would you have a place to stay, would you have the logistics to get their. basic needs to be met and then. to know what I mean like you just don't want to go and like show up on somebody store seven like. yeah and then they were like I don't have a place for you. And then you're freezing you're struggling in a new area that you're not familiar with so. yeah i'm planning, I know I know you want to get back there we talked about it."
10859.0,Patient,Last year.
724.0,Provider,"A couple of times but. The first step would be the talking to somebody at those apartment complexes and then have them, you know give you the telephone over to the housing authority for the. You know, for the city or the county that you're looking to get into and then go direct with them because get your basic need is shelter first raise you have a roof over your head you're no good to your daughter is you don't have anywhere to go."

I was kind of promising so. That was cool movie. And someone else asked me if I wanted to work at their house it's a guy that I know from a and any, but I think he i'm. Fully thing is I don't want him to like think we're an item or i'm going to get lucky, but like he's a good guy right like I don't know who knows, maybe i'll get back with them later on, but right now I can't relationship. You know I got it just be sober you know and just that's all i'm really worried about you know, like instead of relationship, you know. When you get sober you know you don't need that."
724.0,Provider,"You need to be good to yourself, first, before you can start being good the other people."

Right, I was gonna go into about the money thing, but I didn't because I told him I don't think so, you know, because now. i'm, just in case I need to go see my parents and stuff. That I was just thinking, because I don't know. I kind of feel like i'm kind of it's hard, though, like it's not hard, but I just feel like when you call it me and them now that i'm being sober like when my friends came by and he's sober which is cool. he's been sober for a year, two years now. And i'm glad he comes around you know. But. I am, how do I said I don't know for my ex like I just have to ask her I guess let's see what she says if she's sober i'm sure she'll respect me, you know I kind of want to go to counseling with her."

10859.0,Patient,"yeah right now may not be the time I just need to have some time under my belt, I think."
724.0,Provider,"You know, really, you should be going to meetings and. focusing all your energy and your time on yourself and not worrying about. getting into relationships with people that you've had poor relationships in the past with expecting a different outcome, you know, then there's a saying about the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different outcome like it's. Yes, it's Probably not. going to work that way so."
10859.0,Patient,you're just setting yourself up for. Failure you're right.
724.0,Provider,"The priority should be getting right. Making sure medication compliance. making sure that we have any slips. Making sure that you're not that you're developing coping strategies for when you are triggered and when you are concerned and that they're healthy coping strategies and then. Ultimately, doing all these things to better yourself, so that you can get back to your daughter. yeah if you're not doing any of those things, then you're doing it wrong. yeah that's that's. Your priorities. Have you been to the crossroads for any of their groups or."
10859.0,Patient,"I haven't I should go there, though. Like seems like you can't wake up. Like so early in the morning but i'm going to send my time i'll set my my phone."
724.0,Provider,"Are you something like adequately the are you on like a routine. You go to bed at a certain time, or you just winging it."
10859.0,Patient,"Then just kind of winging it, but I slept in a little longer, I was depressed. But um I think now that i'm awake i'm are now i've been thinking about it today i'm like I really want to have a group that I get online with for mental health and they test me too.

Right heart test me and then I have. crossroads I couldn't go to crossroads for a while I couldn't get the bathroom so I just started going to mental health, because I could test there I don't know why I just I just get nervous, you know, like um it's the same you know it's over and stuff so I figured i'll just. I don't know whatever when I feel like I can go just go and test, I guess, I don't know if that's weird but."
724.0,Provider,"song it's got to do it comfort, you know, but if crossroads. requires requires that you do with them to remain in any kind of compliance or."

10859.0,Patient,My my strips i've been taking from last week's because I didn't take that many. i've been taking from last week's I hardly take three a day now. Just because i'm afraid at all i'll run out. Because well.
724.0,Provider,So you went to the pharmacy what did they say.
10859.0,Patient,They said some now my medication wasn't there.
724.0,Provider,wasn't there.
10859.0,Patient,"Yet, or the they just said no. I really just said, we can't pick it up or something and like I don't know what they're talking about I said call them again see what they're talking about. You know, he said there's a mess up with it, or something."
724.0,Provider,Did you talk to shane Intel on Tuesday as past two years.
10859.0,Patient,"We kind of talked we have it set up appointment soon, because I missed my appointment with her. I was kind of not going to my appointments because I was just depressed. And I need to start writing stuff down so don't forget, so I have an appointment with her the 22nd at four o'clock. would just her. I see to keep going to my appointments. For sure read them down sorry if i've been listening to everybody, you know."
724.0,Provider,"What I mean. it's you know it's it's your treatment right. Yes. So if you're. If you're slacking on it, you can't expect to have good outcomes. You know, like this isn't again with bright heart this isn't Inpatient you're not in intensive iot or anything with us this is. Like a low level of you know what I mean, as far as everything we can do for you, like the, the only real control, we have over you is like the medication that we provide to you. And then that's it, you know we can limit that to increase. interaction or commitment but you know it's not Inpatient you know it's not super structured like I can't chase you down like. yeah it'd be like you know get your ass a group, like."
10859.0,Patient,You know yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's not like that, so you really, really do like there's a lot of responsibility on your end. To stay consistent here."
10859.0,Patient,"i'm going to finish after this i'm going to. Do the things I got to do, because I was in the yellow so i'm going to try to."
724.0,Provider,"Your your your surveys do your. Ad survey is do your pH Q surveys do those things all. Those bands and the page count gets those things are do almost weekly advanced do weekly so you have to pick a day and don't wait before group to do it like you have to pick a certain day where. you sit down for about 15 minutes and you get them all done. You know something like an opportunity to not feel rushed answer the survey truthfully so we have a good understanding of what's going on with you. But if you're you know if you're skipping appointments or you're showing up last minute or you're. Just. yeah places like this, where like we just won't retain you don't want to be providing you with service we do you a disservice by like like co signing on like negative behaviors."
10859.0,Patient,"yeah yeah alright, so I am sorry that I kind of was you know forgetful and stuff. But I really do want to."
724.0,Provider,"submit that, like, I understand that that life gets in the way and everything is not so it's not easy, you know when you're in recovery it's not easy. But you. You got to step up a little bit. And just because we only require a handful of things from you and you you're you're requesting a lot from us and the expectation is it's not a fair trade, like the surveys, though they should take a few minutes of your time every week. yeah you go to one group a week that's about an hour you do. A couple individual sessions at about an hour, you know what I mean what if you add up all that time in a month, you know what I mean it's like less. than six hours a month, so. we're not asking for a lot, but you definitely need. You know, you need services. it's the little things that will end up catching it was like anything else."
10859.0,Patient,Right yeah.
724.0,Provider,"If you need to get make like a journal or a scheduler and, like, I want to talk about before putting things in writing on your fridge or windows sticky notes, so you can be like yep check I did it so you're not pressured all day a dry erase board or a chalkboard or something. Anything you know it'd be like like."
10859.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,How to get organized a little bit.
10859.0,Patient,That seems to help me a lot.
724.0,Provider,"For sure, like the biggest things to for you to is like you're a. You seem like you're probably like a like a people pleaser. To better a whole bunch of people that are probably not worth your time you."
10859.0,Patient,hear me yeah. yeah it's probably a little selfish for a while.
724.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, you know you're not a selfish person. You and i've talked to a handful of times that every time like you talk about everybody else and try to make everybody else happy that's good form of codependency."
10859.0,Patient,wow that is it.
724.0,Provider,"yeah would you bring everybody else's needs before your own and. And they're not. they're not doing the same thing for you, you know you're sending us like a doormat. And you put yourself out there to help everybody and then at the end of the day, they're just shutting the door in your face or causing you additional grief and they're not helping you. know so REX you know these people that you've associated with are still using like you, you really do it all you have to delete them from your life. You know."
10859.0,Patient,It you. know they need to hear from somebody else yeah.
724.0,Provider,"From the for the next several months, you really do need to to disconnect from like that that the toxic people in your life because there are things, especially in relationships called like the power and control model where like I don't know anything about your ex so like just hypothetically. You to start getting back to a point where you talk and you spend a little bit more time and you start to do better there's a good chance that she might knock you down a peg because they don't want to see you succeed because if you do, you might fly away. Oh, you have a controller view so. Things like that you just have to be slightly aware of if you're being played or used or abused any of that stuff like you just you. recognize that is probably not a good thing. For you, and you know, deep down that it's it's probably not good if you need to go to counseling and you guys aren't even married yet like can you. What is your. vacation like long term like. signing contracts with people. You really do like your focus needs to be on you, your recovery, because with that success will get you to your daughter."
10859.0,Patient,"Yes, yes I."
724.0,Provider,Am at Humboldt county California you're trying to get out of that that place.
10859.0,Patient,But yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But I keep you're going to keep doing like the like the war progress where it's like two steps forward four steps back. And then, six months I got nowhere."
10859.0,Patient,You can't see myself yeah and yeah I don't want to go back there i'm trying to if I can help it. You.
724.0,Provider,"just focus on yourself get get your ass out of bed side go for a walk and what I mean like you really get to like I know that you're struggling but you're going to force yourself to get up and do these things. it's easy it's easy to be lazy it's easy to stay in bed it's easy to feel sorry for yourself, but you. have to. get past all that self doubt start getting some confidence back."
10859.0,Patient,yeah i'm glad I. waited this appointment actually got up.
724.0,Provider,Your Internet is great whatever wherever you are.
10859.0,Patient,Where yeah.
724.0,Provider,you're right there.
10859.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"What market X on the floor and. that's where you sit during group that's where you sit during the sessions, because this is how this works, you know cool. So yeah."
10859.0,Patient,So plan ISM stay away from these people. Are the meanings. i'm going to have to have some backups where I just don't answer the phone when they call where I go somewhere you go to meeting or.
724.0,Provider,"telephone numbers, you can block up you could delete them you could change your job or you can."
10859.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"A lot of things you can just be upfront be like look we're not going to talk for a while. they're going to be upset i'm going to do catty things, maybe it'd be like I really need to get my life in order, and right now I can't admit anybody emotional currency or mental currency or energy to anybody want myself right now, so I need to be a little selfish okay. So try to separate from these toxic people. Go to your groups do these damn surveys. I did the band seven just it's just like what how long it was what kind of questions at it as just so I was on the same page with everybody else and i've done pH Q nights i've done gads that all those things are. You are you do have the quicker you'll blow through. You know, because you know yourself up about the done. Again we don't ask for much you know just just be be engaged, you know what because that's how it works it can't be half and half out."
10859.0,Patient,Thank you.
724.0,Provider,"yeah no worries. So i'll schedule a follow up with you in about two weeks. Okay, then i'll see you on Tuesday and group. If you're having issues with your medication. Contact Karen as. Put the requested, so they can contact show and tell and let them know what you need to know exactly what happened at the pharmacy you can't just be like yeah they didn't give it to her didn't fill."
10859.0,Patient,yeah yeah like you find out the pharmacies like.
724.0,Provider,"hey we don't have enough supply maybe the DEA. get more information that you pop or you probably need because they're going to ask me like what are they saying here like I don't I don't know like. chantelle to know you know, yes. I contact these people so get a lot of information, all right. Okay alright. be good good meeting."
10859.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"All right, later. For transcription That was the individual session, where the rents. we're going to continue to address compliance. Toxic relationships and. Increased engagement in her treatment efforts with this agency i'll have Karen has reached out to her about a week to schedule follow with me about two weeks. it's hard to schedule her because of the inconsistency with her attendance and technology. No further details, thank you."
