Know like you know what I mean there's certain things that i'm I am i'm capable of.

The disoriented where I got out everything and and then sometimes I I mean I literally like nothing I black out but i'll just kind of like. change what i'm doing and do something else completely. Voluntary oma."
405.0,Provider,unsettling.
14808.0,Patient,it's very unsettling.
405.0,Provider,"Sure, that is."
14808.0,Patient,"I feel like I feel like I have a split decision right here, you know it's like. I can't I don't I don't have surety if I if I can't have if I can't be sure, and myself, what can I be sure I mean if I can't. If I can't if the next step, I take if I don't know them I put out my legs and a hold me up you don't mean it's like I can't I mean it's like I feel like i'm who, what, if I can't trust myself who can I trust you know. Where i'm at so I couldn't trust myself I didn't know was. happening and that's all you guys because I didn't understand my next step, I was taking it could be a bad step. A bad decision you don't want self nothing i'm going to physically hurt myself, but I don't want to put myself in danger. Or do not. mentally appropriate, I want to be, I want to be in a place where I am and I want to be at a place where i'm not only appropriate but I want to be, you know extravagant I want to be in a good place."
405.0,Provider,"Well yeah that makes sense. I understand, and so I took the first steps to ask about about the the reaching out for help, which i'm glad that you did you are calm or now which i'm glad to see so. I think you've gone through a lot there, and this is just our first time meeting, so there are a lot of layers to you at the same time, I think that you are struggling with that mania with the racing thoughts, the speaking so fast that part. Again you're kind of you're you're jumping like different projects because your mind is just keeps moving and moving and. you're on the one hand you're aware that this is happening you just can't control your mind to do it so medication can help you to. Make sure that your mind is continue to more manageable, so that you can control how you're going to behave how you can respond so the idea with the medication is not that you're a zombie or. Not but you feel like you don't have control this actually you feel like you can't control, so you can't function and live the extravagant good life that you'd like to live. And so there, there are medications that we might have heard called mood stabilizers they help to stabilize mood and people with a bipolar disorder or mania and. The medication i'm thinking would also help with the voices that like that sometimes you hear that are really upsetting when you hear them. The medication thinking it's called risperidone it's also called risk for at all it's it's in the anti psychotic class of medications and it's used. For people who have everything you're experiencing the whizzing thoughts, a lot of energy jumping topic to topic can really control your your mind. So hopefully you feel like your mind is slower, you can focus on what you need to do get get what you need to get done and then feel like you can control your mind again that I keep saying control your mind keep that open you'll feel that again if. You can trust yourself again, because that will be so important, like you said."
14808.0,Patient,combine the brain and the mind to work together.
405.0,Provider,"yeah exactly precisely right and exactly so so this medication that actually and people with ptsd can help some anxiety and if people get flashbacks or like sometimes nightmares that can potentially help with. not getting so caught up in those those traumatic memories or flashbacks to, so I think it could be helpful for some of the anxiety can help with irritability anger as well to feel calmer, not as angry. Maybe not as impulsive So even if you feel like feel a strong emotion you don't have to act on it necessarily so, I think it could be helpful in might make you feel sleepy so you. could take it tonight. You can we could try a little bit you could try to take adults earlier in the day and see if see if that's Okay, although it might make you sleepy which you might not like, so you can just take it at night. But then it should let you even if you take it at night, it can last. All day some people get a little bit of a tremor when they take it or maybe muscle stiffness. That usually happens, a little bit higher doses. It can increase the chance of developing diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, if you take a longer term. Not necessarily and, ideally, if you have a primary care doctor, you can meet with that person to get your labs john so for cholesterol markers diabetes markers your weight. But it but for right now, I think you did to help you to really feel like you're getting your mind back in control. That can result in something called tardive dyskinesia which are these kind of weird kind of movements in the mouth of face. That happens if you take higher doses, for a long time so it's not as much of a concern now but it's something to be aware of. So I think that it's one way to think about it is that we want to make sure that you're feeling more in control not struggling and feeling is upset as you are. And then, how to think about longer term treatment that could certainly be revisited in a week or two and and then as progressing is how you see your feeling and hopefully i'll be responding to the medication within a few days to How does that sound."
14808.0,Patient,That sounds. That sounds like a good start.
405.0,Provider,"I think exactly I think it's a good way to think about the good start, what I can do. Since i'm i'm our medical director and usually I consult with people I don't usually follow them i'll see if we can follow one of our. Our nurse practitioners, so that you can potentially see that person tomorrow and then this way at least you'll see somebody tomorrow, to make sure that at least we're. Working together with you see how you're doing what I will wait for is the risperidone I just want to see which pharmacy would you like us to use mindy."
14808.0,Patient,The one also have a cherry and broadway at the right age.
405.0,Provider,Which town or city.

405.0,Provider,"Cherry avenue. Sorry, I see, I see a 5128 second street. or 56 72nd street."
14808.0,Patient,Do you What was it was that was that was at 90802 was the zip code 90802 on broadway.
405.0,Provider,The one that I see on to 11 cherry avenue is 9080 I see.
14808.0,Patient,You go ahead and use that one that's the one.
405.0,Provider,"Okay, so 211 cherry avenue 90802 so i'll send the risperidone the dosing is usually one milligram or two milligrams i'll order the two milligram tablet. And you can usually, when people are in a more of a manic state they can handle a little bit more. And so what we'll do is you could just take the half tablet today and i'll write that on the order and then you can take the full hour tomorrow, and so, essentially for today. I give you a week supply, but essentially getting just so we don't consider can keep adjusting the dose but take a half half tablet today take a full tablet tomorrow and then, and then you can take it in the afternoon or evening overnight make you sleepy so you can just take it at night."
14808.0,Patient,Okay.
405.0,Provider,And we'll have somebody follow up with you tomorrow to okay.
14808.0,Patient,Okay okay that sounds like a good start.
405.0,Provider,"And then, if you feel like you're getting worse, or you feel like you're thinking about tough thoughts about suicide where you're going to act on trying to attack or hurt someone else you can just go to St mary's or wherever you feel safe, you can get an evaluation in person okay."
14808.0,Patient,Okay Thank you so much.
405.0,Provider,"you're welcome in DR so i'll order the medication should be available within the next hour or so, and then you probably take it later tonight, but if you wanted to if you're feeling more worked up and revved up again, you can certainly take it earlier most likely. When you're in that kind of state that your body can handle it, even if it might make you a little bit tired all right."
14808.0,Patient,"Okay, so can I can I still see smoke my weed and stuff the thc with that."
405.0,Provider,"that's a good question in terms of the interaction with the medication is it, it might make the medication, not as effective but i'm more concerned that the thc going to make your make the mind racing and the voices make that worse actually so. be aware of the. Especially with the thc it has a greater chance of actually making your your mind race like that make it harder to focus and make more likely to have like those kind of hallucination so the thc can can do that. Or at least make it worse yeah or make it worse yet."
14808.0,Patient,Oh. I didn't know that.
405.0,Provider,yeah the thc can do that yeah yeah.
14808.0,Patient,"OK OK. I will, but I will definitely definitely be aware of that."
405.0,Provider,Now yeah I think that's good to be wherever yeah keep interacting with your dogs and if you can be around your boyfriend at least someone who you find supportive that'd be important all right.
14808.0,Patient,Okay.
405.0,Provider,Thank you so much you're welcome Dr IP well okay.
14808.0,Patient,Thank you.
