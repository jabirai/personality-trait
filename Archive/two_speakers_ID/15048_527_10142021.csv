Just you know pent up stuff that we know we haven't talked about so then it kind of met to a head and I was like. Sure hey like, if you want to like because I was like I would go home and i'm in a i'm currently in a band too, and like we do a lot of like. Like promo stuff and like sell music videos i'm it's like almost I guess another job. And so I go up to the bay area lot that's where my family is and spending a lot of time up there, or I would go home, you know to shoot a music video and then. Go you know see my friends and stuff and then I guess I wasn't seeing my parents and they were like she was feeling a certain way about it and. never brought it up she's like oh you're busy, and like I don't want to be a burden.

What do you mean you owe us and then that was kind of like the trigger. And I was like you know we got into it and then. We squash it now, and like. I think that there's more clear communication. Between us, as far as like hey This is my boundary and like, if you want to spend time with me or, if you want to talk to me like you have to call me, and if you want to you know. You want us to do something when i'm when i'm home like you have to vocalize that because i'm not a mind reader and I can't."
527.0,Provider,write right.
15048.0,Patient,"And like i'm not going to just come home and sit at home and sit on the couch and hang out with you guys like i'd rather like hey let's go do something, or like hey let's all have dinner together, you know. That was that was a good thing that happened reason."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
15048.0,Patient,"I feel a lot better but yeah I was definitely the emotional support child. Yes, yes."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. um how was school growing up as. far as friends and. You know, it sounds like things were kind of chaotic at home, but how was school."
15048.0,Patient,"growing up, it was cool. I had like a solid Group of Friends throughout you know throughout middle school and then into high school. I. I stopped hanging out with those people, because I was like straight edge. And so they all got into like smoking weed and drinking and I was like not into that so much, so I was like kind of cut ties with that and then. I didn't have friends for like a good portion of like my freshman year, then I found a solid group of friends and I just kind of the same situation, where I was like always with them every weekend, always with them not really at home that was."
527.0,Provider,yeah. I was kind of your escape.
15048.0,Patient,"yeah just was like. The norm for me like I was like and I never had people over at home. She never. Never, even when my because my brother my mom sent my brother away, she was like I can't raise these two other kids and having been here like. Okay, so. Which is probably the best thing she could have done for me and my little brother. Okay, but. Even what after he left I just didn't ever have people over. never really incorporated that part of my life into my family life. But yeah I mean high school was the same thing just always with my friends, I started working as soon as I got my driver's license I you know. got promoted, I was like a store manager at like 17 so i'm kind of busy they're working or going to school. Sure, and this is like. You know my the beginning of my end of my junior year into my senior year, so I was just like that whole time I was just working. or with friends or with a girlfriend."

15048.0,Patient,"live together and then i'm like. You know my depression was pretty bad like the second year, just like really introverted and not really like available. She was she's somebody who needs that. Okay, but now I think we've kind of like hit her stride to. share. Share where."

And then I moved down from the bay area to long beach and that's where I kind of like lost a lot of my support network, and I think that's when I really first realized that like Oh, you have depression and you can't just bury it under everything. Tasks because I didn't know how to do anything down here I. first time I was like financially. really responsible for myself rent. This okay so. yeah So the first time I really got a taste of like Oh, this is what your mental health is actually like."

15048.0,Patient,"What does that really entail actually because i'm i'm really curious. Because bright heart is all like it seems like it's mostly addiction stuff. I, like their their website it's what it kind of shows i'm curious as to what these group sessions are because I. know are in yeah you are in a mental health group."
527.0,Provider,"So we will, which is a group I do that group on Tuesdays. Not when you're in yes, I do that group on Tuesdays and then I also I do another mental health group on Wednesdays, we do have a pretty strong addiction component with bright heart. I also my certification is an eating disorder, so we also have an eating disorder component of bright heart, and so I do a couple groups. in the evenings while it's evening. time for me, but."
15048.0,Patient,"Sometimes, taking those, like the quizzes like. Massive really uncomfortable because i'm like i'm not an addict so I don't want to answer. But."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah some of yeah some of them, and some of them, but don't doesn't always apply, so you. Just kind of answered the best that you can with it so yeah we understand but yes, you are in a mental health group so. Okay, so the topics that I bring to group are are more mental health focus like."
15048.0,Patient,"yeah i've never done a grounder the. first time I. tried to do it, they got the schedule all mixed up and they told me that I was scheduled for this time, but then it was this time. Okay."
527.0,Provider,There was.
15048.0,Patient,"A whole snafu and then the second time I signed on for group, and I was like I do this and then they brought me to the finance department, because nobody put my card on file. And I was like. i'm supposed to be in group, because I need to go to group to get my meds filled. And I was like freaking out, but then they were like no no here you go here's your meds like just come to the next one. But."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah exactly So is there, other than Tuesdays we won't be able to schedule, because you can't do an individual session on your group day but and the way the groups work we we understand not group groups aren't for everybody. yeah but you know what we like to see is at least give it a good month to try to NF and then we can and if you're going to your individuals you're getting your medications doing in your pretty stable, we can read, we can reassess that frequency of group session too so."
15048.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I think I like the therapy aspect of it, I, like the one on one. No more yeah but yeah well i'm like looking for I guess what I was looking for is more like a MED management, because i'm like Okay, but i'm like this therapy component is really nice so maybe. That will. yeah that will help. yeah like I need to have like a deadline said for."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, the other The other thing to Alex is that what I always try to educate on my first sessions to is there's a couple different ways we can do therapy obviously you have your group session with your medication appointments and. But we can also adjust our amount of time that we meet like the minimum we need to me is like 30 minutes, so if if you want shorter sessions, if you feel like. i'm doing pretty well and I don't need the full hour, you know we can schedule, you know, a shorter session to check in and that's Okay, too, or if you're like no I really need to kind of unpack some things for. The next few weeks and then maybe we can reassess that So those are a couple options that I always throw out there, because I know I know everybody's busy, but I also want to make sure you guys are getting what you need with therapy too so. And if things come up that you know, and I also say you know if we if we schedule an hour and you don't need the whole time that's okay to like at least we've you've made that that time available for you just to focus on you and so we'll use it, you know, however, we need to say."
15048.0,Patient,"yeah i'm on covered California, right now, so that it's like not the best health insurance. And something so. I know I get like three for like three discounted sessions and then after that it goes to like the full pay out of pocket."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay. yeah. So do you have a day. Of the week that's better for you outside of Tuesday for sessions.
15048.0,Patient,"I typically will work because I work for this, I also none other ADHD thing I do is like overbook myself for everything. Okay, so I typically I work for the school. 20 hours a week for my department."
