Okay Elizabeth burgers medical records it's not for all patient of Dr actors. Oh, goodness. He started her on gabapentin she's not picked it up. De de seven to 12, which is considered mile piece, you know 12 I mean dd seven and eight President my pitch to nine or 12 is that a moderate chores was negative. I want to have a criteria about for bipolar disorder. And look like she needs at least five you need at least three so i've definitely seen some you know bipolar she even mentioned as anger and mood and. She used the term wouldn't want. psychopath. that she cries daily anxiety all the time. Just woke up with a boyfriend says she's miserable. And I will say this, she was not forthcoming, with her history, I had already done my research on her. And that's why I saw that she had gone to the golden gate bridge to jump I have a date though she said around 2000 2018. i'm i'm going to still read her as a moderate risk we went over the safety protocol denies any putting history or access to firearms. And so, she was incarcerated for hard drugs. Even the bps that miss cocaine marijuana. She not all of that, except for marijuana. doing about her attention she's like oh yeah. Alcohol she said she doing daily skip yesterday had only a beard the day before. Then she gets emotional issues not drinking, but she didn't know that he has given me seizures. His there blacking out drinking. So yeah definitely possibility of bipolar this order. The question. I will follow up with her on the 18th i'm going to send an email to Dr pachter and Sean that they think because she hasn't attended a single point, in that sense or bps. I didn't give her the number for Dr factor. or tomorrow at 11am or Friday. that's all that I have for listening."
