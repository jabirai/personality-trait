705.0,Provider,This will be a poor clock with George last name la seat so in. hi George.
14813.0,Patient,hey Valerie.
705.0,Provider,Let me ask you to put on your.
14813.0,Patient,Video oh yeah gosh I don't know why that oh it's turns off here we go.
705.0,Provider,"No, a very. yeah it happens and the good news is we figure it out."
14813.0,Patient,Absolutely yeah.
705.0,Provider,How was the week.
14813.0,Patient,The weeks good yeah the week sprint going well. i've been good on energy motivated optimistic about the future. All good things yeah. We speak great.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, those are all good things. What are you treating us."
14813.0,Patient,"um you know that's I was thinking about that the other day and. You know so told me if i'm correct about this Valerie, but it seems like when I get off meds and on meds things kind of like. I don't know if it's just a change of my body chemistry and some stuffing kicking him, it seems like everything goes great and then. You and then after a while, maybe by body adjust to that and then things get weird, so I would expect that from getting on the meds, but I feel like good after getting off of them, maybe because that was my intention, and I feel happy about that and it's sort of feeling everything else. But i've been feeling great since I got off of them and it's almost like I was feeling a little more on the edge before I got off of them, which is strange because I feel like the manager supposed to help with that so maybe you could explain that to me a little bit."
705.0,Provider,"George everybody is different, especially with metabolism, and sometimes some of the medications that maybe you've even taken. will increase the anxiety where they're like Okay, no this isn't what I want it. You know. If you read most of your medications as a side."
14813.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Some of the anti anxiety, or even depression. Some sometimes in there is a side effect may increase anxiety or may and they'll list, like some of the reasons why you're taking it it's like. Okay."
14813.0,Patient,Right right okay.
705.0,Provider,"i'm thinking more you're on the right track when you were talking about it makes more sense for you, because you didn't want to take the meds you have taken yourself off the meds and feel like you're thriving better."
14813.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And could that be to a boost for not only your self confidence, but a boost to in your mood because of the competence."
14813.0,Patient,"Right okay. right on yeah that makes sense to you just reminded me that yeah what one of the side effects of that well future and I think what's more anxiety, so perhaps. The way you just mentioned, with the you know the boost in confidence, along with not having something that's increasing my anxiety, maybe don't see any other to the reasons that are feeling a little bit better."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you can continue to monitor, you know georgie you're really good you have that self awareness, monitor and in the event that you do feel like that it's not as manageable. Then you can discuss you know, taking a MED and maybe something different than wellbutrin or other, you know."
14813.0,Patient,Right right okay cool yeah I guess the good part is that yeah the weeks weeks been going well. i've just been able to manage things a lot better in terms of in terms of mood and my reactions and i've just been able to stay positive so yeah yeah it's been it's been great.
705.0,Provider,I I almost here like this sense George of hesitancy to even say it out loud because you're like I feel so good that i'm all. yeah when said other shoe gonna drop.
14813.0,Patient,"Right, yes, you know we're all skeptics oh I shouldn't say we all are i'm a skeptic. For yeah you know. I oh it's also the hesitancy is me thinking back to like was it really that good and just yeah I couldn't think of anything that. really set me off so. So yeah, I guess, I can confidently say the weeks it's been a good week. And I could read."
705.0,Provider,"and brings every day and having the confidence to like already your confidence boost it for where you are today. you're learning more so, even with the cognitive behavioral therapy, how to look at it, maybe a different way. Right same thing if you're having a down day. To be able to just your confidence, where I can manage this, too, and I will."
14813.0,Patient,"let's definitely yeah and that's been that's been that's been a booster to just being able to manage the down dates when they come along you know. And I took note of something on the last group session ever mentioning to you how i've really been taking to the. The exercises you've been putting into place for mindfulness and staying present and just being like being here with anxiety kicks off and not having those worries, but I realize it's if that's meditation. So meditation that's that's meditation so."
705.0,Provider,it's great yeah.
14813.0,Patient,"Right yeah. yeah so i've had i've never really. taken to well I shouldn't say never I mean i've done yoga and i've done other things that sort of are similar to that, but then I just realized it's. it's it's a form of meditation like you said so, hopefully i'm going to put that more into my daily practice as a cognitive therapy for myself so yeah so that kind of lets me it kind of opens up the world's meditation how it benefits me so another confidence booster as well that. You can. feel good about being able to handle the emotions and finding ways to. to sell fair pies you know."
705.0,Provider,"it's that level of hope to that you now have where it's just like i'm hopeful, because I know the meditation is working grounding techniques, whatever you want to view it is. yeah it is working i'm feeling the benefits of it."
14813.0,Patient,"most definitely yeah it's it's cool it's really cool you learn stuff like that yeah. So hopefully and feel free to let me know if there's other ways to you know, since we're doing the one I wanted to maybe for me personally, that will. Let me stay on that track yeah let me. be able to meditate or I don't know, maybe, something that maybe you could think of that is more suitable for for my for what you know about me in order to. continue that. vm. That meditation."
705.0,Provider,yeah okay it's a hot. yeah i'm like yes yeah.
14813.0,Patient,For sure.
705.0,Provider,"I would encourage you, then this week. It even maybe like you tell me how many times that you would be willing, but just to start exploring other types of meditation. I don't care if you Google it I don't care if you try different Apps just to start to expand what your toolbox may be, and so, if you're willing to maybe at least one time explore research it."
14813.0,Patient,cool yeah yeah for sure. yeah definitely.
705.0,Provider,"Trying to see to because, once you start to open that door, then you start to be able to say I don't like guided meditation or I do like guided meditation my preferences a female's voiceover a mel's voice no voice, I like instruments. yeah and you can just sort it out, you know."
14813.0,Patient,Right right okay so there's instrumental meditation to. cool. I guess I should have known that.
705.0,Provider,Many times do you. walk around and say hey does anybody know of meditation like yeah.
14813.0,Patient,"Well, you know it's i've been hearing about people doing that, with gongs you know I know. My wife went to a sort of a Grad school that was based on business philosophies and nails had these bowls that they start each each session with. And now i'm hearing about some of the therapy, people are doing with his gongs and just sort of like absorbing those vibrations and things so i'll probably look into this a little bit more."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and there's also two there's like meditation bells or sometimes people call them like be a Co di n G balls or metal balls and they have. Different sounds."
14813.0,Patient,You know I don't I don't but i'll look into that.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I will just let me see if I can copy and Swiss here. But i've seen them before they have different ones that give off different sounds. that's not letting me copy, let me just see if I can write it and then. let's see it's be. A di n G is what they're calling, but then some people talk about bells just like you were talking about that has the bowl that makes the whole sound out ones need to. yeah American eat merican eagles American Indian. films are instrumental flutes. Sometimes people just feel like it's more self soothing to hear like a flute versus some other you know."
14813.0,Patient,"most definitely and it's just like it just goes back to me thinking about my interest in you know in music and frequencies and how we. where they come from and why certain sounds have have different effects on our bodies, our minds so yeah i'm getting my mind, is really starting to ramp up here. And I definitely going to research, this after we're done today but yeah for sure yeah like flutes and American Indian instruments, and you know. yeah there'll be some fun research for sure."
705.0,Provider,"And it's neat to to just try it out and if it's just like scratch, this one okay next you know and try something else. You were seeing to that your your wife, when she was in school and that that's what they do with the bowl and things like that does she happened to try to practice that at all."
14813.0,Patient,"She doesn't know she doesn't. That was the method of teaching in the school that she was in she has an interest in it, I mean sometimes she'll put on a pair of headphones and just listen to those sounds. But that's not something that she personally does, I mean I don't I don't see her sessions, but I haven't heard her speak of that and I haven't seen them around so. She does not do that."
705.0,Provider,I was thinking more along the lines of couples meditation.
14813.0,Patient,Oh yeah people will feel the energy by.
705.0,Provider,Having something like that different music and you. Have you know how the energies. And you can move the energies and you do. All this work. Right fun stuff.
14813.0,Patient,"Oh yeah that sounds like a great idea. I have to, I have to propose that. Today, because we did listen to music together like at the end of the day, we'll put on some calming music and sort of an immerse ourselves in that so maybe we'll take a step further and do something with some different sounds and the transfer of energy and that sort of thing. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Definitely yeah and exciting to not only to get where it's like you're doing what you need to do, but then also bringing it to what you can do as a couple that's also therapeutic and fun and healing."
14813.0,Patient,"For sure that's a really good idea and something to do more, of two. Together, especially since we we've sort of been on this. path of therapy together, I mean that's so much lately but valid perhaps be something i'll bring us back together in that respect. yeah yeah that sounds great."
705.0,Provider,"How has it been to like you know this week, have you noticed if there's been any periods, where you felt maybe. more depressed than you haven't been or any other like feeling of anxiety."
14813.0,Patient,"i'm not so much, but it seems like i'm able to deal with the triggers a little bit more, I mean. At the end of the day, I know my body sorta like coming off of the caffeine, that I drink in the morning and throughout the day sort of like. getting into this down period that's usually where i'm the most susceptible to certain things being sad and I found that they're not so much you know they don't bug me as much and i'm able to like sort of process them in a more healthy way, rather than having a fight my. body's reaction to them, it seems like they just sort of. Even out, you know so i've been noticing that and. You know, having that reaction is kept my mood a little bit more a little bit more up than usual, you know, not so much in this place of doom like it has been previously. So yeah it's. There, there really hasn't been anything in the past week that I can think of that's really gotten me down. Nothing I can think of now either. yeah."
705.0,Provider,Would you say then that you're filling this week more of a sense of being balanced.
14813.0,Patient,"yeah more of a sense of being balance and, as I continue to think about it. And you actually brought up a good point. During the last noon. group therapy session, you were all talking about how this time of year gets gets you down right heading towards the holidays, and you know i'll be honest, I was feeling good but I felt ashamed to share it because it seemed you know I kind of wanted. Everyone was, I would say, everyone but there's two people, in particular, you know I didn't want to be like yeah i'm doing great and while everyone else is not doing so great so. I just wanted to listen to that have in here where they're coming from, but I was you know is during this time of year, I feel pretty good, mainly because the weather's getting chilly or like. This chili or whether kind of get the blood flowing I do look forward to the holidays, especially now that. we're able to you know see each other again races previously likely totally floated over the holidays, so one of the things that got me really sad is that wasn't able to see my family. But also being back here in California, not only am I closer to them, and I can actually see them the holidays are coming up, so the seasonal depression. kind of that comes from me more in the summer, just because it's hot and I don't think you know everyone was also talking about oh I love the sunshine, I was like man I don't really like I like the sunshine, but I just don't like. The hot weather that can be associated with it, so I was kind of on the opposite and maybe I should have shared that, because that would have lifted everyone up a little bit better but. I didn't have the same sentiment, as the people that are speaking oh."
705.0,Provider,"that's okay George you when you're you're comfortable, then you can share and sometimes I have people check in to just say, for me, right now, life is going great and. It yeah people that are not at that level yet home it's just like. But appreciate it appreciating to the rock different. You use the seasons."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah yeah for sure the seasons great I mean I forgot that California, even though I do love the snow in Colorado at this time of year, where to start getting a little chillier I can put out my. Long sleeve shirt and my hoodies and I can get that certain brisk breeze that kind of gives me that that kid to stay energized and motivated I really love this time of year so yeah somebody that's part of it too well i'm feeling good."
705.0,Provider,little boy. is free.
14813.0,Patient,"he's too he's gonna be three he's about two and a half now yeah I took him to the doctor today with my wife and got him checked out and everything's good on that front so. Another big relief and. Nice confidence booster. For for both him and me and my wife. So yeah. You know, having him into everything just a synergy between all of us is good right now."
705.0,Provider,"And the holidays, now that he's older enough to like see these things and talking, you know he's probably."
14813.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. yeah yeah idiot asked about Halloween to that's something that you know the excitement of halloweens back. Now that you know our sons a little older and she likes to sort of he kept his imagination is growing, and you know we're able to relate to it a little bit more so we're really looking forward to Halloween this year. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, that will be great times and to feel those memories."
14813.0,Patient,"most definitely. yeah sure it's just nice to see. You know these interactions that keep us balanced, you know coming back to be able to look forward to them again it's really nice so. You know that's that's the hesitation to have so I have to think of like did I really have that greater week it might just feeling really good right now. Am I worried about much it's like you know you have to think cuz me my mindset previously was the resolve these were using. You know what else. Am I gonna be able to you know, last year's like are we good feel to have Halloween. So sometimes those things enter my mind, but right now. it's looking good, and I feel I feel grateful that we are deep in the possibility to do Halloween and you know for our son to have that in his. In his childhood. So, right now, I feel I feel good about it."
705.0,Provider,yeah it's also to just priceless to see little ones like Halloween costumes bring some such joy.
14813.0,Patient,"Oh yeah oh for sure yeah it's I think it's first Halloween. We did go out with that yeah like right before this October of. 2019 so we did have that chance to go out and that was awesome we skipped it was kind of a bummer but now we're like we're twice as excited about it because we skipped it last time so oh. yeah watching him dress up and do all that stuff like really reminds me of how much fun I had doing that, as a kid. and being able to see him that's off."
705.0,Provider,letting out your inner child to.
14813.0,Patient,hmm. For sure.
705.0,Provider,"I know, last time we were talking about the continuations of eating healthy and how you were feeling the."
14813.0,Patient,benefit yeah.
705.0,Provider,still going on.
14813.0,Patient,"yeah for the most part, I had some fast food, the other day I didn't sit well it. reminded reminded me of yeah, this is what it's called this is. This is why the reasons that. You know. Your body isn't too happy some of the time, but other than that yeah then generally staying on the path of you know, making my my kale smoothie every morning and. Generally eating generally eating better also you know, trying to get into the habit of more exercise so there's this window of I like to do outdoor stuff I like mountain biking so I know I have this window before it starts raining a lot. To get out there and mountain bike so i've been making sure I do, that every week and trying to implement a plan of even more than that. You know, doing more cardiovascular stuff and just keeping my body healthy so yeah still it still going good on those France."
705.0,Provider,"Would it be to that part of the reason why you're not taking meds but you're still feeling like you can manage. That you are eating better you are incorporating now physical activity, and so the combination of it as like hey This seems workable."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah yeah real good point made there, the well future and as told this before I was played I is that it's it's kind of stimulate it gives you energy and. My body is just kind of running off that for a bunch so that sort of you know, artificial increase my metabolism was. causing me to not eat so much in thinking, I have energy, but now i'm off my field is more of a responsibility to create that stuff a little more, naturally. So yeah exercise has been helping a lot, and also the eating better it's been huge, even more so than like it's already surpassed the effects that I had when I wasn't doing that and taking that so. that's a really good feeling it's good to feel what that's like again. yeah yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And that's where you know yourself, so you know, instead of like when is the shoe gonna drop, and all this is just like. No you're monitoring yourself more and in the event that things do maybe go one way is recreating that balance like you were talking about the different meditation because now you're looking at that meditation so value they're bringing it in."
14813.0,Patient,"For sure, especially yeah cooperating that too, so the meditation exercise and eating healthy I think three huge benefits. are three things that will really help sort of maintain this this level of euphoria yeah."
705.0,Provider,"That holistic approach to if you look at all the areas and it's like if you feed, all of them in there and balance. The new probably you know will feel more balanced, but when one of them it's like a like a tire if you have a gap, you know in in the tire doesn't roll as much kind of like we are. yeah yeah. it's gonna flat tire."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah yeah exactly adding to that too. I think one thing i'm working on now and additional that it's reducing my stress level. yeah I think one thing I did before, to try and compensate for the lack of some of those things was working a lot. there's that whole stigma working a lot everyone's like oh great you're working a lot it's like yeah it's great, but you know, not so much with my body's telling me it's not so great, you know. just tried to pull back and realize I don't have to do that much and realize that i'm doing a lot of that to compensate for. You know, to compensate for the lack of the other things, so now that. You know the body's feeling good and I happened doing more of those other three things i'm hoping that i'm able to pull back on my stress level related to work. Because that's really that was one of the big that's one of the big thing that was really getting me down was just incessantly working and how I. it's just strange it's. In I don't know if I can attribute it to the wellbutrin and having an extra energy but. I don't know I feel like that it's like yeah the mood was that, but then I was like oh I got all this extra energy when I put it into something which caused work which cause stress so. i'm trying to pull back on that, so that the way of life i'm trying to reintroduce now is more more balanced out."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly I go back to that holistic, will you know work life if it's where you're just so obsessing over work is just like a high gets to the point where wears you down meeting. Ah."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah it's exactly what you just said, the obsession with it it's crazy like. Like there's certain things i'm like. I just yeah having them session with just like you know i'm doing a lot of consulting right now and I went to get back to people, even when works over like a. push up emails like a night i'm like I should probably get back to them, but then I think to myself, maybe I shouldn't I should just. Stop i'll just put all this away as soon as I walk out of the office and I get to it tomorrow and. Maybe yeah try and combat obsession down and. You know not have the sense of urgency they're like please these people immediately. by getting back to them right away, even though they appreciate it and they tell me that I like I don't necessarily need to do that."
705.0,Provider,"i'm hearing, establishing a healthy boundary of even with emails like it's so important where it's just like yeah I will only answer in between these hours. yeah yeah."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah I think I need to set that I think I need to tell my clients, I think I need to put that somewhere in my email response, or something just so. Not only to not do it, but also let them know hey i'm not gonna be responding to emails at this particular time so yeah setting setting those boundaries will be something i'll put it into i'll put into practice, this week. For sure yeah."
705.0,Provider,"I think that's great choice, Georgia and i've seen the emails that will stay it on there, like will return within 36 hours or return the response, or will return, you know, sometimes you'll see okay."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. Because I got I just recently gotten to this new job, since I moved out here, which is, which is really cool but it's very like email intensive so it's a lot of consulting and getting back to people and. i've never been in a position. similar to that so i'm learning as I go it's like I have to like sort of shut this off that lever else that that faucet was to. just turn it off, which will in turn help my stress level a good time. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And I can imagine like you said that turning that faucet off because, if one female gets in you know this yeah yeah fears and where does it it and."
14813.0,Patient,Oh totally yeah for sure it's it's definitely like this it foss in with what i'm doing now it's more like a foster that's been turned on quite a bit so. yeah managing that will be a good thing. For you know long term and immediate sort of satisfaction of having those those boundaries.
705.0,Provider,are now i'm hearing so many people describe burnout that.
14813.0,Patient,Because we're.
705.0,Provider,so hard and putting all time and energy that burnout starts happening and it's like yeah to avoid it setting the healthy limits taking your breaks when you can. yeah.
14813.0,Patient,"most definitely and you know. I always thought burnout was because he did something. That he liked so much that it just sort of like war you down, but now i'm realizing. You know it's not like I love doing this particular task, but I just do the obsessive because it distracts me from everything else and that's really what caused the burnout for me to have to go back into therapy, because I was really feeling I was like man i'm burned out. And it's i've never said that before never said i've always thought that I could I could usually handle most things, I put my mind to but. You know the I was definitely doing too much in wore me down mentally and physically so yeah i've been experiencing what that's actually like, for the first time, and how to manage that."
705.0,Provider,"and combating it to with like physical exercise, because we know with burnout it affects you physically and you may have you know where you feeling, just so tired and you know not energetic. All the things those things start happening, where then you're like okay wait a minute, maybe I have to maintain where i'm doing some physical exercise."
14813.0,Patient,Oh definitely yeah and you know now i'm thinking back to when I was doing all that work I wasn't sleeping either which. I don't know why I thought that was a good idea yeah I mean I mean.
705.0,Provider,You know. not going to have a good day I think you.
14813.0,Patient,know just like. You know I mean yeah definitely not definitely not it's it's been nice to get some regular sleep again so. yeah is it you're really making me think about all the factors that contribute to that stuff right now Valerie and how I wasn't even thinking about it when it was happening so definitely building a good amount of awareness right now.
705.0,Provider,"it's good that you have this now because, in the middle of burnout i'm sorry George but not many people at all. Once you're burned out you're burned out your. Be you know be thinking about hey how do I pull myself out of it is just you're in crisis mode."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah it's interesting how we how we get to that point, you know. How we get there, and what we do to get us out. of it. yeah. Right. you're definitely right about that. it's you know. I want to say that. You know, like in the in hindsight it sounds just like. You say oh I knew those things did I like know those things, and why you know you kind of want to analyze what was going on there mentally. Why, even though you know. In I guess it's all those contributing factors that was kind of pulling you down like a weight right like you're uncomfortable like bodies uncomfortable when you can't therefore your mind isn't thinking straight and it's all these other things that kick in. Because it's like even though you know it's like you're not capable of really pulling yourself out of that. Out of that hole. yeah so it's good that you know you've helped me with this building this momentum to get back to. Being able to talk, talk about in hindsight and say hey okay cool like. we're we're moving along here and, hopefully, you know employees, some of these ideas to keep it that way. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And it's snowing to that it's not going to be, I know, sometimes it's strive for that perfectionist like it's not going to be perfect. there's going to be days that you were even talking about eating habits, were the one day you had fast food and it's like well, you can allow that sometimes have that your body rebelled and that's a whole different. But it's allowing yourself, you know to be like Okay, and all with physical exercise, I know, at the end of my shift if I take a walk I feel better are there some days, where I just like okay what's going to be the motivation. yeah."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah most definitely that's very true yeah it's interesting to think about what that means to us being human you know, sometimes I could just sort of like think about that for an extended period of time. But yeah yeah you're right. You know. Learning it learning from those experiences, I think, are the most important thing you know. Being able to move ahead in the healthy way. is even you know it's part of that. sure."
705.0,Provider,"And what we know about being human too, especially with you know, like you have a little two year old. like to see what you're doing and role modeling what you're doing and they're like really paying attention when you think they're not."
14813.0,Patient,"Oh for sure Oh, he affirms all those thoughts I have you know he affirms all of it like an immediately he just. yeah he lets me know that we're all just still learning all the time, you know knowledge is not. Knowledge is a finite thing that we're always able to continually learn and then it's not like we have any ownership over any of that knowledge it's something we're continually doing from experiences from each other. it's like our lives are finite but the knowledge is is endless so we can never say we really. never say we really know anything I guess yeah not to get too philosophical anyway. that's that's that they got boys pleased."
705.0,Provider,"I like that, and as you're talking I can just might my mind starts processing, whereas like yeah that's really an interesting thought, because you can take that to different levels to. know about like well, is it. With being human, is it the feelings that we're going to talk about and expand on what that is for a human, or is it, how we develop in time, is it the experience because it's not just to me knowledge isn't just education."
14813.0,Patient,What.
705.0,Provider,Are you know those opportunities it's a much bigger than.
14813.0,Patient,"yeah no definitely it is so much you know. it's just it's cool to know how we do certain things because of our instincts as as humans as we've been talking about that then like the beyond that and how. You know, we don't really have a comprehension of it because we don't need those things to survive, but when we get in that place where our minds able to start to roam free. it's a it's fun to think about what's beyond what our minds are capable of. Like what's out there and how how it all intertwined you know how it, how it creates our existence."
705.0,Provider,"And our into one another and then with with that too is just. Building how you connect with yourself building how you connect with others, building more in a global sense. And just being able to say well you know I go all over the place, because then i'm like What would it be like to pour a two year old when your life is a two year old and remembering that time of your."
14813.0,Patient,"own for sure that's why that is fake. You know, like the affirmation I have for my son it's like he's already there it's almost like we're just sort of tailoring came to this. whole world, this existence what's now what's what's what we think is the right thing now so he's already born perfect we're just getting him to adjust and to be able to survive, you know in this world. and You know I go I go into that with knowledge that I don't know everything that I feel like he teaches me a lot. As well hey teaches me how just to be free and to remember what it's like to not have. You know 40 something years ahead of him, and how maybe he's seeing and thinking about things as a two year old how that's beneficial to me, you know, so we teach each other, which is, I think the most exciting part of it. we're both each other's teachers and you know learners learn from each other."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and some of your things that. you're doing. Such as exercising and things like that he's taken note, and it will become more of his normal routine to because he's like hey dad does this, this is, this is what we do and already you're developing his coping skills, thank you."
14813.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well he's my exercise. A lot of taxis my exercise just to use his energy level and the things he does, to keep up with him when he is really excited definitely gets me, you know it gets me excited then makes me aware of my own limitations yeah like he could just. Go and run around for. Now I can't do that, after. I like so then then at that point i'm. Living vicariously through his sort of boundless energy."
705.0,Provider,Definitely i'm sure he keeps you running and. The questions of why. See at that stage of why.
14813.0,Patient,"No he's not if there are his doctor asked that too, and when we said that he does ask all those questions kind of raised our eyebrows but then we realized. he'll he'll get there we'll get there when he's ready, you know to to ask us that's when they that's what i'll get that's when you know. really have to figure out. You know. You really will really have to figure out the answers to that to those why you know him asking why is this, why is that into giving them an honest and honest answer you know. so that he can learn in the right way and not. yeah he learned the oddest way that's not based on whatever things we went through you know. So you can come up with his own judgements and opinions on things, although I guess it's up to us to guide him in a truthful way yeah something that gives him the freedom to do that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's possible to that your communication with him is he doesn't feel the need to ask why because you're communicating and you're telling them things that maybe. You know other parents don't do as much, and so he's just like there's no reason to ask why at this at this stage of the game."
14813.0,Patient,"yeah he's still if you're right you're right, you know I think he's just sort of still at that it doesn't really matter why I just know that i'm satisfied are not satisfied. So he definitely lets us know any in either one of those. moods you know whether he is really happy about it or not happy about it so. Well, well take care of the wise when they may come on so but not really. not really to not really. Hope you know not hoping that they're here now like kind of thankful they're not so. They know some of those questions can be tough."
705.0,Provider,"What did we do before Google, because now."
14813.0,Patient,"I know right that's a whole nother thing you know google's like I don't know I feel I try and. I use Google a lot and. I tried to remember, was like when Google wasn't around, so I feel like it was better. I feel like I feel like you know just being able to think about you know digging into technology, although it's nice to have it good to have that at your fingertips, but just to be able to to think you know, based on memory. yeah that to adjust everything that Google tells us is the truth so yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and also, if you can't make a decision, and then you have Google and all of a sudden gives you like 100 options that we didn't know before and it's. it's like is this some of the cause of stress."
14813.0,Patient,"you're telling you yeah. The too many options thing is, I was talking about this with my wife, the other day. And I one of the things that really has hit me when, after we lived in Europe and living in like a generally small smallish town out in Europe. We didn't have as many options as we do out here and now, just going into a grocery store and seeing like for the options for toothpaste. yeah it's just like oh man. it's so insane how we have that other you know how that's how that's where we're at now.
