As ever, leave early or. And I don't trust. I don't trust them at all I don't I don't trust them at all, so when they say Oh, why don't you go back to say I can't do that. So."
740.0,Provider,For what can you do.
16016.0,Patient,"Well, I can say that i'm excited. About. I tell myself, I said, my goal is after Christmas, I will get a SEC cuz I was able to work extra job or not extra jobs, excuse me extra hours on this job. And right after Christmas i'ma go hoard we're working two jobs, so that I could get the supplies that I need for this business idea, like, I have my. Certification and body sculpting already had there. And I was just kind of pick up one other scale and then just go from there i'm making sure that I got all the supplies that I need in ages rent a room and just start hustling. that's, all I can do. That sound like and that's to me that's like the quickest way to to certainly. that's, the only way."
740.0,Provider,"The only way it's just the way that this is the way that you can think of right now. I know. That is tough because. it's tough to be alone and to feel lonely all at the same time. it's hard. And it can be in is very difficult right, especially when the people that. you're supposed to have in your corner you don't trust them. So it's kind of like. not really being alone by force. By not having any more options. So. it's very difficult during the holiday season. Not being able to see your children and. Being so far away from them. Trying to make a name for yourself, where you are so that you don't have to go back to where you came from. I can be hard. And I empathize with you. Know it's really difficult and. At the end of the day. We don't see. You know, when I say God will make away, but you don't see no way. yeah. It can be difficult, is it is a, it is a. A testing of your faith. One thing I will say. the midst of everything you've gone through. Use of us here today. Some way. It needs to always have the strength to make it through. And so, since you are a woman of faith one thing you do have on your side if you ain't got nothing else is that you know that God has been good to you."
16016.0,Patient,"it's been a battle with it, too, because you know. The pain to be so intense. And so the pages. Sometimes you just don't know what to believe. This is definitely or this form. This is the only Christmas that. My children. But I know this is the Christmas where i'm tired of not having Christmas what much. what's hard. is like. What am I doing like. Oh, my God what is going on with me by what is it that I can't see."
740.0,Provider,"We. Do we add to our own suffering. And so we just you just have to really. Allow your faith take charge, and to do what you have to do. I know for fact that is gonna turn around."
16016.0,Patient,So I was Mr fall.
740.0,Provider,yeah the shoe.
16016.0,Patient,"moved around and make sure that I was connected in the right spot, let me. Know six or seven this job. But yes most definitely I have a question that. song so um can I still pursue my own my body sculpting so. Okay wanna Okay, because you see a trusting God and don't trust me okay gotcha."
740.0,Provider,That only he can work through that.
16016.0,Patient,"Okay, I don't know why is. OK, as just one I know it sounds crazy to me."
740.0,Provider,"But you can trust in other folks will you know imma imma imma get hooked up and i'm gonna call Larry Neil and imma imma call them and see if they now. You see, with this situation you gotta ask for guidance like with this situation Okay, so this is the desire, this is what I feel what's the direction that I should go you leave me. yeah i'm saying. Though i'm right that's my main. thing about it is you can you can kill two birds in one stone, you could run the office and have someplace to stay."
16016.0,Patient,"that's the end you know what that's actually my next goal that are wrong thing. Which is to find because you know when it's a people home dad funny about they live space, even though i've written there you know i'm saying. Like some people get funny about you know people come through they have saw I saw avoid all that I said well. Let me just see if I can find a space."
740.0,Provider,"That you don't have like no budget sweets and stuff out there, like the weekly places they give you like every day. But it's funny I live in California."
16016.0,Patient,"Oh, my God."
740.0,Provider,mom was.
16016.0,Patient,"So what after probably do I think this is what i'm gonna do i'm gonna set a goal, I might have to revise my goal now, because I know the weekly hotels is kind of but. i'm a work to get all my supplies because it's not like i'm getting a business loan, or if I don't think it's not going to take that much to start it up, but i'm going to gather all my supplies, while i'm in my car and then i'll just do. The weekly hotels that way cuz it's already furnish. You know what i'm seeing."
740.0,Provider,That seeing her life and water.

740.0,Provider,"it out. Right and if not, you know you can always check out airbnb."
16016.0,Patient,"So basically I was wondering about that at airbnb, you will have to schedule, like a you know, like a few days in advance right like a few days like a week in advance."
740.0,Provider,"Right, can you can skill and what i'm what i'm saying is is they, you can find like airbnb. To the point to where i'm like say is, if you that, because of course they charge you per day right, but if you can find you a like a nice small little studio. A little garage in the back that they renovated it or whatever, and they honestly I mean honestly with airbnb they don't care of you stay and long as you pay they don't care how long you stay there are you gotta do is, let me know, is it Okay, if I say multiple. Can I reach our airbnb every month. And then we'll you ain't gotta worry about us being there by yourself. Because they don't care they give me money. You can just find you a cheap, one that you. You can find you a cheap, one that you can under a forward so one that's cheap enough to where it got you know you got the smile look kitchen and a little restroom and lose some you know, am I, and you are you gotta do is is is once you. As the me or ask the person the sister whoever the owner, whoever it is once you reserve it. You know, and you start to stay there, like just say you reserve before week and then, once you reserve it then all you have to do. is just talk to him or talked about whoever it is an excellent is it Okay, if you can claim it for another week if you're not booked already, I would like to stay for another week. And then, after that that's when you can ask them, is it possible, you know if I can, if I can do your airbnb airbnb monthly like it used to charge on the same thing you're not going up on your charging is possible, I can do it monthly. You don't know English shakes."
16016.0,Patient,"They don't care, you know they didn't pay. So, so in the beginning, and so I shouldn't ask them in the beginning."
740.0,Provider,"Oh. i'll kind of crazy part about it is even if you say no, even if they say no that's fine they got thousands of airbnb you can go."
16016.0,Patient,Banks.
740.0,Provider,"BC but don't get any phone is inflation people won't pay money. So if you're the same person who stands for that they don't care as long as you pay. So much things like this choose the airbnb this kind of less popular. The one they got like a little bit like the ratings is like three points or 2.5 something like that. Do me me like this, so that way you don't have nobody coming in booking because if you got airbnb is that are really popping you got five stars, but you will always have somebody book and they go like oh i'm so sorry I already got reservations, but if you get one it's kind of like medium."

740.0,Provider,"will say the thing about it is even once you get the supplies, you still got a bit of the brain. which may this big on take some time. So might as well be comfortable. I think for me it's the roof over the head first. Because, then you get the clarity, you being a comfortable place a safe place, then you be able to think clearer instead of watching behind you been shamed about trying to comfort like that's too much because, even with the supplies, you might get jack. God forbid. i'm just saying is is is the best thing to do is the hustle to save up the money, so that you can have you a place to stay. And then, when you do that, then you should be able to think more rationally. you're comfortable you're in a safer place, then we can then you could figure out Okay, I need to be as as playing because you still need to be the plan, because I know pointing wish your windows wasting your money on supplies, if you ain't got no clientele."
16016.0,Patient,I was just gonna I G it out just.
740.0,Provider,"I mean give you this little fan. get your algae algae it out first and then see who's interested in being get your supplies does that make sense don't don't get supplies, a big.
