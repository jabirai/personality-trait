15050.0,Patient,"and am I going well i've done a bunch of intake assessments, but not for this specific need."
120.0,Provider,This type of thing okay awesome so yeah I mean if you've done something similar it's just kind of a chance for. just going to ask you a bunch of questions about your situation and kind of what's going on for you and get an idea of what the needs are and. And then kind of tell you a little bit about what we have to offer and see if that's something that sounds you know beneficial to you and see if it's kind of a good fit that way. Can you hear me okay I didn't put my earphones on.
15050.0,Patient,yeah I can hear you fine.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, because I can I just didn't because I didn't and so, but I can grab them you want me to."
15050.0,Patient,know that all right.
120.0,Provider,Okay um. So do you have any questions before we. jump into this.
15050.0,Patient,"i'm not really I have like no expectation, so I don't even know what question I would ask."
120.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and my understanding is that you're kind of looking at the I O P program Is that correct okay."
15050.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"All right, so um so tell me kind of what what brought you here what you're what you're looking for like why why now or did you kind of reach out."
15050.0,Patient,"um well my mom, I guess, to say the least, she she I. I don't know like I have been struggling with my eating for quite some time, and as long as I remember, like, I can remember i've had body image issues. I finally like had a really bad week where I ate probably like 400 calories a day. And I like was. Not feeling good, so I I called my mom and kind of like admitted to her that. Like I was really struggling, and all this stuff and then she you know got very sad, of course, and then I live like an hour and a half, away from her so then. In early August, she saw me in person, for the first time in a while, and she was like like you look scary thing and you're getting bruised all over because you're not like getting nutrients in your body and blah blah blah, and she basically was just like. yeah she was kind of like you need to start a program otherwise you're going to be hospitalized so."
120.0,Provider,"So a little bit of a. What was it shocked for you, when she said that or did you kind of her like I kind of know."
15050.0,Patient,"um I knew it was an issue I just didn't it's not really that it was a shock like it wasn't surprised that I didn't feel motivated to. get help I told her that I was had my intake assessment and she's like, how do you feel, and I was like i'm going to gain weight and she was like well you're going to get healthy is what it is. And so i'm struggling with that piece a lot like I have this motivation to get healthy and get better, but at the same time, like I know the cost is going to be to gain weight, which feels like a really terrifying thought right now so."
120.0,Provider,"Understandable you know and it's a. Your mom sounds like a very smart person like she's trying to she understands kind of what your fears are but also bringing a perspective of want to happier, you know, have a life. You know something that's more meaningful than just your body size yeah for sure. um. So, as far as motivation you're kind of on the fence, like you, I mean you're motivated because you, you know that it's kind of a problem but it's also like terrifying is that is that accurate okay all right, can you tell me like how this user has been here. Okay, I might have a cat sitting right next to me."
15050.0,Patient,I have two dogs I get it.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I got dogs do they're asleep, but the cats on it anyway um. And so I was just wondering like, how is it how has your eating disorder affected you like, do you feel like it's interfering with like your ability to do work or school or whatever it is that you do or it's interfering with relationships that sort of thing."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I think um. It takes away just from so much of my day like even down to track, so I do work full time I have my master's degree in education so i'm a teacher. And I. I just feel like i'm not present I feel like i'm constantly like every part of my life at when i'm teaching when i'm. Trying to do social things, especially involving food like anything and everything I feel like there's always this piece, that I cannot. get out of the way of my life because it's just at the forefront of my mind like if i'm going out with my friends i'm like wondering how i'm going to look wondering what I wear if it's going to make me look fat like. Oh, are we going to eat, how many like what are we going to drink if we're going to drink that's a lot of calories, how can I, you know eat during the day if i'm going to go drink later because it's too many calories it's just feel so. it's yeah. it's constantly there and I was like it's like always there yeah it's annoying of everything."
120.0,Provider,"feels yeah for sure you know, and, ironically, the more you restrict food, the latter that gets because your body's like dude I don't want to die i'm going to make you think about this until you give me something to eat. You know becomes becomes worse, so you described it really well um Have you ever gotten any treatment for the eating disorder."
15050.0,Patient,"Right now i'm in therapy, I was doing psychiatry when it kind of came up because it was just like part of my intake for that are for psychiatry and. My psychiatry referred me to my to a therapist but my therapist told me. Like after session one she told me she wasn't going to be able to continue services if I wasn't in a more intensive program because she said, like i'm. she's like honestly I could hospitalized you with what you're telling me but i'm not going to because you told me you're going to go get treatment so basically she was like I have to end services for. ethical reasons if you're not in a program so that's when I really decided to make the steps to get into a program and she's going to continue working with me on trauma based stuff so that we my insurance can cover her therapy, as well as this program."
120.0,Provider,So this therapist. You just you just started with them.
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I think i've seen her for like three weeks now, I see her weekly."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's primarily the focus will be on trauma with her."
15050.0,Patient,Right now it's both but she said that she'll have to create that like boundary once I start the Program.
120.0,Provider,"So yeah yeah it's it's tricky because there's so many overlap areas, you know as far as what affects what for sure you know so i'm glad that you're kind of hitting different areas. Prior to those last three weeks so where did you see a therapist or was this is kind of a new world for you."
15050.0,Patient,"I saw a therapist, for I saw a trauma therapist, for I think at the end of 2020 leading into the beginning of 2021 I saw her for a couple months but. I just didn't I didn't feel like I got much out of it, and then in college, I saw therapist for about a year and also didn't feel like I got much out of it. I think i've done more work and three weeks with this new therapist and I ever have in my other longer term therapy sessions."
120.0,Provider,"So, like it's a good thing with this person give me some give me some that way okay so you've kind of dabbled in outpatient therapy not been very helpful, have you ever seen a dietitian. Well i'm always excited for people who have never seen as I mentioned before, because it is kinda like any world when you get to meet with somebody that actually knows their stuff and, like any news for a dietitian not somebody that you know, whatever the CRATE know. latest raises. So i'm hoping that'll be a source of strength for you and experience."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah i'm excited for that I think it's going to help me so i'm also vegetarian, which I know can really make this a challenge as well."
120.0,Provider,"But I am too i'm registering also and I recovered from the US, where I had it for many years in college and and i've been able to sign to kind of that sweet spot so."
15050.0,Patient,It makes me feel hopeful.
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15050.0,Patient,"Every time, every time I Sam but sherry, and I was like oh i'm like. i'm not changing that so."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, but it is depends on the intention behind it, you know yeah like you can you can adequately nourish yourself and be vegetarian. At least in my experience, without being a restrictive mindset, you know, and you know because we don't want to ask you know, depending on what you're a lot of the reason why people slow, as you probably know this, but. You know people kind of block of that sometimes because it's restricted by nature. You know, and I think if you're. If you're willing to die, rather than you know eat an apple you know eat meat or whatever I think that's probably a problem. Yes, what you don't have to those are the two choices, you know you know, I have to either die or you know you can find a middle ground yeah yeah and still live in a way that is feels I mean I assuming it's an ethical thing that's what."
15050.0,Patient,i've been vegetarian for like two and a half years so. A lot longer than this became an intensive problem so.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean if the biggest question you just gotta keep asking yourself is you know why am I doing this because it's because I feel pure if it because I feel like. To now i'm like if it's it kind of related to be good you're good person like those are all things we want to try to challenge because. When we start equating food with our morals like I am good if I eat carrots i'm bad if I brownies you know that we connect that and it has nothing to do you know see there's not a moral thing it's just a collection of you know of. ingredients that creates something that's edible you know it hasn't like like this COP has no moral connection with my goodness it's just a cup. yeah you know but i've had my own what's good or bad, and then we start obsessing about it. And so it's like you know eating me it's a personal choice you get to choose if you're doing it because you feel like you're good to me that way in your bad if you don't that's where you got to kind of challenge it but it's it's you know. You know more, based on kind of what and more of an ethics kind of thing I think it can be I think they can go together, I think you can be recovered, I mean I mean I I consider myself a covered in Michigan so. It can happen. I know it's a long winded answer but."
15050.0,Patient,it's good it's good information.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so anyway um so tell me kind of what is going on with your eating disorder right now like, what can you can I you, you mentioned calories a few times so i'm assuming you focus on on on calories. You tell me a little bit about what it, what are you doing with food right now."
15050.0,Patient,"um. Right now, I am just. I think that i'm experiencing some orthorexia as well because. y'all like like I eat through every day for lunch and then try to have a primarily vegetable dinner. But I, like last night, it was so I feel gross still thinking about it, like we had so my boyfriend went and got us hamburger helper for just like as a tree, he says, and we use like vegetarian stuff to make it, but I just like felt so disgusting after like literally. I was like I don't even want to shower because I don't want to get undressed because I feel so gross like it just felt so dirty like the taste was in my mouth after brushing my teeth even and like I just like. I definitely feel like I experienced that a lot, where the food that I eat has to feel clean, or like. I don't know that's just the best way I can describe it and he's if i'm and when I do eat I definitely. focus on like smaller portions like. When I eat lunch it's one one apple and one plum right now, because that's the vegetables, we got maybe next time it'll be like. carrots and hummus or something usually I go on the cycle of like a couple weeks i'll eat all I crave like just fruits and then maybe the next week i'll create just vegetables and i'll eat like cucumbers and hummus or carrots and hummus or something. A dinner that I really like right now is frozen, vegetables and cooking them and putting melted cheese on them, which I. also restrict the amount of cheese, because I know cheese has a lot of calories and some hot sauce and that's like that's my you know my dinner right now i'm that i'm on. So yeah."
120.0,Provider,"You know I think you'll be amazed when you start when you start kind of stretching your food beliefs and you're what you're willing to eat. Much better you're going to feel, because if you know, like i'm like what he said he put cheese on i'm like oh good, because then you'll have more satiating food that will not make you get to hear about food constantly. Like yeah. It tastes better and then you feel full house and you're like Well, I can think about other things in my life, instead of thinking about food. yeah like it's not this overarching obsession. Because i'm are you. restrict food, the more you think about it, and then it just makes you so much. yeah sound like the toilet paper thing. Last year, what you know what's. going to people thought they wouldn't have toilet paper they think about it all time in a board it."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah yeah very same principle. yeah I also feel like, then, when I offered foods like yesterday, one of my students parents brought us like these tiny little portions of like banana flown and I was like I feel like I need to eat it out of like respect and like. A social thing, but then I just like felt. Literally felt like shit like I, like my body was not feeling good like I felt. Like I don't know like I felt yeah I just felt not good, I don't know how to explain it."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah I mean it sounds like you definitely have some kind of orthorexic kind of stuff going on and. As it kind of gotten more and more.
15050.0,Patient,yeah. Definitely.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so give me an idea so right now food you eat kind of a fruit based lunch and have a vegetable based dinner. Do you have like a calorie range that you're always trying to stay in."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I deleted my calorie counting APP, but I still try to stay within 1200 and like obviously. For me, like I know this is not good, but I feel like the lower the better, so, if I can stay under I don't like eat to me 1200 which I know a lot of people are like I want to stay within like this certain range so they'll eat more. But for me i'm like if I don't eat that much like I feel good."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so how you feel like you're doing something right if you eat us. Okay um do you ever binge."
15050.0,Patient,"not really. The only like i've only the I can think of only one time that I have been judged and it was on pizza and now I just am not eating pizza at all, because I don't, not that I feel like I would binge again, but I feel I think I feel a lot of guilt about it. So I just don't eat pizza anymore. and I don't know if I would technically be pitching. I don't think so, but when i'm on my period, I do have really strong cravings for like sweets, so I do. handy probably like. Once a day during my periods I don't know if that counts as like a binge or whatever, but I will eat more. On my period or my period is something."
120.0,Provider,"Right Okay, when you do eat a little more is your guilt go along with it, though you feel guilty all the time. um What about purging do you ever like vomit or like do anything to specifically counteract what you may have eaten."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I do exercise to counteract for sure, like i'll exercise just to exercise and then, if I feel like a too much exercise again in the evening. Like last night I did a high intensity interval training workout because I was like a eight that banana flop earlier in the day, so it's like I I felt like I needed to do something to counteract it. i've only i've only made myself throw up once and it was actually before this even became a problem, like I and it wasn't even that I think I drink too much water like I just felt like I was kind of throw up and I was like this feeling is not going to go away, unless I do. So I just threw up, and it was like really easy like I definitely physically needed to it wasn't yeah so I don't really I got scared of ruining my teeth so i'm pretty avoidance of me."
120.0,Provider,"As a good thing that's a natural fear fear. yeah sure okay so so no bingeing that you that really you know feels like a binge, but there is some you know competencies behaviors in regards to your exercises like so when you actually have to use because I eat this. is like a math equation okay um do you ever use laxatives or diet pills inside that. No okay um how much do you exercise right now i'm like on a regular basis."
15050.0,Patient,"um since I started my teaching job it's been like 30 minutes a day for like five to seven days a week um. But on the weekends, if I have time i'll do like an hour or so."
120.0,Provider,And what is your exercise look like.
15050.0,Patient,"i'm usually like a. An intensive like five to 10 minute Cardio warm up to get my heart rate going, because then I can burn more calories when I do weight training so after the Cardio warm up i'll do weight training."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. it's interesting you know yeah how focus your. Your exercises on calorie burning like you said, I have to get an incredible but I burn more calories like he tell that's a really big obsessional piece for you. yeah sure okay um. I have you are you having any medical complications from this like do you, you mentioned having a period, you have a normal period, are you on birth control or."
15050.0,Patient,"No, I haven't been on birth control for about two years and I was having a normal period, like a five to seven day a week period. But now i've been getting it late and it's been coming in, like two to three days of spotting and that's it it's not a real period anymore. i'm experiencing a lot of hair loss, like my hair is obscenely thin and it's really frustrating me. I like I said i've been getting really easy bruising that I know I like i've always gotten bruises obviously but i've never it's never been like this to wear a literally like covered from a goal to fly I don't even know how I get them i'm just covered in bruises. and"
120.0,Provider,You get lightheaded when you stand up and sit down. What about being like cold you find yourself analytical. yeah okay you're like yes.
15050.0,Patient,"yeah i'm like i'm a sweater and socks right now well obviously more than i'm wearing pants too, but my. toes are so."
120.0,Provider,"yeah okay all right um do you know, if you like, have you ever had an ekg and makes your hearts okay. No Okay, do you have a doctor you're working with to kind of check out physical issues."
15050.0,Patient,"I emailed my doctor what was going on, because I needed a referral for another clinic that was like it was the first one my mom found so I ended up coming here anyway, but. She kind of was just like okay schedule, well, it took me three emails to get Ahold of her and each one was like titled like eating disorder complications. And she didn't know until like the third one. And then she was like okay just schedule physical with me and then I didn't because I was like at that point, you know it was like a week and a half and I felt, you know, like i'll get these bursts of a lot of motivation to get. You know. So then, now I just haven't scheduled appointment. And she hasn't followed up or ask me any questions i'm like if I died, right now, like. You would give me like yeah."
120.0,Provider,So yeah.
15050.0,Patient,"No, I don't have a doctor i'm working with a Seattle and it sounds like your doctor doesn't know a lot about eating disorders, because they are kind of their own animal."
120.0,Provider,"You know I hear over and over and over and over and over and over how Dr i'll be like. Well you're you're Okay, right now, you know, like and that immediately tells the patient oh good what i'm doing is not damaging you know and it's just so. yeah you have to kind of get a doctor that knows and there, it is hard because they're not all of them yeah um, but we will need to have it get an ekg and labs. And at some point, so I mean sooner than later, so if you can you know, like that will be prerequisite to being able to enter our program is medical stability. So if you can get that done ASAP and that might have to be in an instant care like if you can't get into your doctor. Okay, but you know, whatever your your, however, that works, we need that. For sure and."
15050.0,Patient,A referral or something so I have Kaiser I also have Kaiser insurance on top of my address that lets me come here. So that's what i'll probably go to. Do I need like a referral or do I just tell my doctor that I need that to be able to start this program.
120.0,Provider,"And so amanda who already has been in contact with you. She has. She can tell you exactly about that because I don't know all the insurance policies for different States as far as how they work. Most of the time, if you like, if you needed a you know, a doctor's appointment I don't do need a referral for like a right you shouldn't you can buy call and say hey I need to get. You know the physical or I need labs and ekg and then they should be able to tell you what you would need for that, but we have specific. ritual labs they need. Like you know the different vitamin levels and things like that, and then then you'd like vital signs and wait on that we wouldn't send them so but amanda can answer that particular question about it. Okay cool to know about that I don't want to give you the wrong information."
15050.0,Patient,Thank you.
120.0,Provider,"Then, usually so usually we we as far as like ongoing monitoring. Especially if you're having some physical symptoms, like you, are like the weight loss and whatnot I know that's a sign that your body's struggling, and so it probably will need more monitoring. And, but we definitely need an initial an initial baseline of where you're at right now. With labs and ekg and weight and we do ask that you do a blind, meaning that you turn on the scale, so that they don't you know and again doctors are notorious for you know oh it's gone up, it was gone down or whatever you know, like. They say that because, again I have to remember so we're the weird ones. You know, treat everybody like their normal what were the ones that are making this into more it needs to be. yeah because they tell people all the time about like what they're waiting since. i'm the weird. So we have to you know we asked that they not tell you, and you have to also be like please don't tell me um and but they still send us grew up or on your paperwork or whatever, so you gotta be you know able to not slip out if. You know, but. Anyway, um what how tall, are you."
15050.0,Patient,Five seven.
120.0,Provider,And do you know your current weight.
15050.0,Patient,"Now I through my boyfriend well my mom made my boyfriend throughout my scale. So awesome I will. Wait myself was like a month ago, and I was at 135 I think or 133."
120.0,Provider,"So a month ago was 133. yeah you don't know what it is now. No Okay, do you feel like your body has changed, I know it's hard to know what your body's doing, because we have an eating disorder you frequently are very out of touch with your body. but can you sense if your body has changed in that month like as far as what your clothes fit things like that."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like I think i'm gaining weight, but. At the same time, like I would do this to myself to where like I would go like maybe I was oh like when I was out of town for. A music festival in July, I like came back, and I was like oh my God I I look like a game like 10 pounds back and then I got on the scale and I had lost weight still. So I don't know. yeah I would say that I feel like I came to wait, but I don't know how accurate."
120.0,Provider,Accurate that okay yeah yeah i'm glad that you're able to challenge that a little bit like you know my perception might not be. yeah you know trustworthy right now for sure so okay um Do you know what your highest and lowest weight have been like as an adult and like about when.
15050.0,Patient,"yeah, so I will, when I was like 18 I got up to like 155 right when I was in college um you know definitely gain the freshman 15. And then, by the time I was I had like have gone through so many weight fluctuations, by the time I was like i'm turning 19. I was I had lost a bunch of way I was down to I think like 120. Because I like went through my first year of college I this really like emotionally abusive boyfriend and so when we broke up, I was like you know so depressed not eating blah blah blah, so I lost like so much weight that actually wasn't even on purpose. Right and then I you know stayed at about like 140 for a couple years and then after I graduated college I got with the guy and with now who geez Filipino so he you know, a big part of him is like eating good and stuff not good, as in like healthy."
120.0,Provider,Eating right like. balanced and normal.
15050.0,Patient,"yeah so I gained a bunch of way and it was like the happy relationship late, so I was at 160 at my highest in August of 2020 and then that's when I like started to feel really bad about myself and that's when I started all the dieting and stuff."
120.0,Provider,So the dieting kind of started heavily in August ish of 2020.
15050.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,it's something happened that kind of like go from being kind of like okay about things also oh I gotta lose weight.
15050.0,Patient,"Well, I wasn't like I knew that I was gaining weight, but it was I took pictures in a Bikini and I was like. I was like I literally remember looking and like almost crying I was like I feel so disgusting like I used to feel so confident in a Bikini and, like all the stuff. By couldn't get one that I felt like fit right, and when I saw the pictures of myself, I was like I saw you like oh my stomach which I had never had before, and like I just did it yeah when I saw this."
120.0,Provider,"kind of set it off right away. All right, um how I was gonna ask you how you feel about the numbers specifically mean you're not humble yourself for a month and so. You haven't been able to focus on numbers quite as much, but like does the number itself kind of throw you into a fit, or is it more of how you look or how you feel or like are all of the above all of those things."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah it's definitely all of them, when I had my scale, it would be a lot more so because I maybe like one day I would wake up and and the thing is because i'm doing weight training like one thing that I, I know, but. Like not able to process in my mind is that because i'm doing like weight training weight bearing stuff. i'm gaining weight and muscle, so I wake up and look at myself in the mirror and be like damn I look good like i'm getting like you know muscle tone and my stomach and blah blah blah, and then I go step on the scale and i'm like oh shit but like I just gained two pounds, you know. So, if you like. It was this kind of like cycle and then one day, maybe i'd wake up and like feel like I looked horrible and then i'd step on the scale and I lost three pounds and i'm like Oh, you know you know, so it definitely was a lot about the numbers. And I feel like seeing the number alone would really change my perception, you know, like I would look in the mirror and be like you, like my stomach looks bad and then I would step on the scale and be like Oh, but i'm down to 130."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
15050.0,Patient,"And then i'd be like Oh, you know I don't want that bad now."
120.0,Provider,"You know so very confusing for sure okay. But it sounds, how do you feel about your body right now."
15050.0,Patient,"um I feel not good. Okay, I don't think I like i'm I feel like I. You know, without getting help i'm never going to feel like I look good, and I have like there's. there's this one way that I haven't told my boyfriend that I know how to tell like kind of where i'm at with my weight is without the scale it's like. I have scoliosis so my my ribs like bend a weird way that when i'm a little bit over 135 I can see there's like I don't even know how to explain it I sound insane.

You know, like I don't know some really fattening food I don't want to eat that but how am I supposed to tell them no I don't want to eat that you know so and I.

120.0,Provider,"Okay, no attempts no plans, no intense. But sometimes passive and and that's you know relatively common because, like whenever you're having a hard time your your mind is like what can I do this go away. And so it kind of all fantasize about that sort of thing and. And some of that might you know pop up it's kind of like playing whack a mole a lot of times with emotions, you know it's kind of like I can't lose weight boom Oh, but i'm going to kill myself. I need to do it, you know it's kind of like that you know. part of its kind of learning how to manage this orchestra of weird emotions. You know, so that it works for you to get yourself safe, do you feel like if you begin to have those thoughts that you can keep yourself safe he's like you have a good support team."

120.0,Provider,"Okay it's been a while. All right, i'm good do you have any history of substance abuse alcohol mail on that. And you're taking medications you're on um. in regards to like your family's already family history, a little concerned or eating disorders or addiction issues."
15050.0,Patient,yeah my my mom pretty much all of the adults in my family have substance use issues. So there's that even my grandparents.
120.0,Provider,Alcohol or other things.
15050.0,Patient,"My parents were alcohol and math and then my grandparents were mostly pills and alcohol and. yeah. So there's that in terms of the mental health my parents both have ADHD i've never been been diagnosed but. They both have ADHD I think I honestly think my dad suffers from depression, but he's just the guy like who is like everything's fine like he. Just finally got his first pair of seeing like I glass prescription glasses when he's needed them for like 10 years you know, like he's that kind of guy who, just like."
120.0,Provider,i'm fine.
15050.0,Patient,"So I feel like he is depressed. i'm sorry I don't mean to laugh but i'm just like just saying everything all at once, feels so comedic that it could happen to. yeah so then my grandfather was undiagnosed bipolar but my mom was pretty certain that he had it and then my aunt has bipolar one she is like off the rails getting married every other month like he's very much untreated bipolar, which is very sad and then. What else yeah I think that's most."
120.0,Provider,Any other eating disorders.
15050.0,Patient,"My mom has like. Am I also she's addicted to anything someone figured I could get addicted to so there was a time where she was like. My mom has never been skinny um well not never. My mom has always for the most part, that I can remember she's always been fairly overweight not like so obese that she like can't walk or something but she's overweight and then there was a time when I was in high school where she got super into like keto diet and. Like exercising every day blah blah blah, and she got so skinny like I like so skinny and even now she looks back and she's like I did not look right the way that I looked. At that and then she got in a relationship and gained it all back and she's been overweight, ever since then, because she says like she's you know, like she has a problem with food because she over eats and she doesn't really know how to stop blah blah blah that kind of thing. So I guess and then my dad has always been very much. weight oriented with himself and he talks it up to wanting to live a healthy lifestyle like from the time I was like six years old, he would take me on runs with him. So there's that and then he actually like introduced me to the calorie counting APP and like it's not that he was like you're fat, you need it like. I told me that i'm overweight he's never told me any of that, but I think it's just like leading by example, like he found something that he felt that he really connect connected with first weight loss, so he, like shared it with me. So."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so quite a bit of kind of body image focusing on trying to master your food, you know in different ways that kind of thing okay um do they are they using substances now you mentioned alcohol meth Is that what you said. yeah with math something that was a long time ago, or more recent."
15050.0,Patient,No yeah That was a long time ago. My mom has been cleaned from that for like 20 years.
120.0,Provider,So okay.
15050.0,Patient,But she'll.
120.0,Provider,be hard to be a social worker and. yeah i'm not be you know because of that.
15050.0,Patient,"She was drinking when she was a social worker, though, which was wild because she would go to like I just was always so confused because she would go to work and help all these kids and then she would come home, and I was like. mom I mean you, and like two weeks, like what's going on, you know. yeah so that was it was really weird yeah they've been clean, for a long time my mom has been cleaned from drinking for almost 10 years, I think. Probably somewhere around there since I was in high school she was, I think she was drinking like my freshman year of high school and I got clean after that. My step dad actually relapsed a couple years ago and he's been clean for like a couple months and then. My dad has never admitted to having a drinking issue but me and his girlfriend both see it, he is definitely a binge drinker like he'll go all week without drinking and then get hammered. All weekend, you know. So there's that."
120.0,Provider,"A little bit about about so your parents are divorced, and then mom remarried and God has a girlfriend."
15050.0,Patient,"Well, actually my mom and my stepdad aren't together they haven't been since I was like 10 but he or like 12 but he raised me like I would go when I was going between houses, it would be my mom my. dad and my step dad like I would spend a couple days with my mom a couple days with my dad and my stuff okay. Have a really good relationship with him."
120.0,Provider,"that's awesome that's cool um so is your so they're all your mom is single Now then, and you said that a single."
15050.0,Patient,"know my step dad is has been in a relationship, for I don't know four years, probably. And my mama. says she's single but her ex boyfriend has lived with her, since they broke up so they take me like sleeping different rooms, but. Like she's she's never dated anyone else, she doesn't date like. I don't know what it's really fucking weird To be honest, like sorry."
120.0,Provider,For the record.
15050.0,Patient,But I like it it's something that I just tried to avoid thinking about and talking about because.
120.0,Provider,it's not your control but yeah. It really doesn't really make sense but.
15050.0,Patient,it's really frustrating.
120.0,Provider,"yeah it sounds like it how's your relationship with your your mom I mean she sounds like she's pretty supportive, at least with recovery stuff."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like part of it is this is something I talked to my therapist about to like when I was growing up, you know, there was obviously some form of neglect because she was drinking. But even more so, like there was medical neglect like I had scoliosis, so much so that I had to have a spine surgery for it my senior year of high school. And when I would complain about it, or when I would ask to go to the doctor, she would literally just tell me like you're being dramatic like you don't need to go to the doctor like you're fine blah blah blah. So, finally, like. I was just having so much pain that my dad took me to the doctor, which I wasn't even on his shirt insurance. I was on my mom's insurance, which was why he wasn't taking care of any of that stuff and then. They basically just referred me to a surgeon because of how bad it was and my mom was like oh like I feel really bad now like, knowing that it was this battle along and I was like well, I was trying to tell. You yeah yeah so. And you know that's not even just with that, like i've been dealing with mental health issues since middle school and she's never addressed them she's never taken me to get help or anything. So. I feel like now, we have a good relationship, I feel like I can talk to her, but that stuff that I that never goes away, you know so."
120.0,Provider,"yeah that hurts it's deep down, you know stab sort of that you're trying to make sense of them. yeah What about with your your step dad and your dad or do you have decent relationships with them."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah my step dad i'm pretty close with when he was drinking, you know it really obviously put a strain on a relationship, but I feel. Like now that he's clean we're we're really rebuilding our relationship where i'm you know when I go to my hometown and starting to get food with him again and. You know, do other things with him that I wasn't doing when he was drinking, because I was like i'm not going to be around that. Right and me and my dad have a pretty good relationship um. You know, definitely the girl i'm like a daddy's girl, I just want him to be proud of me, and like. think the best of me and and know that he did a good job with me and stuff so he's definitely a person that like. I just think the world of him and but that also having such high expectations also puts a strain on our relationship, at the same time, because then, if he does, let me down, I feel very let down, you know. I yeah I love him and I adore him so."
120.0,Provider,"Right right, so it makes it more yeah whenever you, you know have more investment in something it hurts more when it gets. yeah but it doesn't quite meet expectations for sure okay and what's your living situation right now, do you live alone or with. Oh yeah me and my boyfriend look. Together boyfriend okay. yeah how's that how's that living situation."
15050.0,Patient,"um it's pretty good we said he's really supportive and really lovely with all of this, like. Everything that i'm going through."
120.0,Provider,Music pretty stable person for you.
15050.0,Patient,yeah.

120.0,Provider,I like that he had you know helps you to get rid of your scam on something that's free.
15050.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, he does a little check in with me to before I come home from work he'll be like you know, on a scale of one to 10. You know how are you feeling because he doesn't you know he knows some days I can be more playful and other days i'm just like i'm not enough people move, so he always tries to."
120.0,Provider,Know that's awesome yeah that's a good guy good guy. um. And you have siblings.
15050.0,Patient,"I have a lot of siblings I have on my mom said, I have three, I have two brothers and one sister, and then on my dad side, I have two sisters and two stepsisters I don't get along with my stuff sisters."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so some some relationships are good and some not so good, with your siblings. yeah okay. um. And I assume you don't have any kids yourself do yeah."
15050.0,Patient,Just my puppies.
120.0,Provider,"Your your copy of your verbatim or whatever it is for kids right um and you said that you you're a teacher, you have a master's in education. What kind of teaching."
15050.0,Patient,"I teach special education, so I teach right now my classes kindergarten but they'll loop through with me until second grade and then they'll move on to a new teacher in third grade."
120.0,Provider,Okay well do you like your job.
15050.0,Patient,I love my job I love my staff and my classroom I love my that's.
120.0,Provider,"Very good um What about your own your friends, I do have very many like gals girlfriends or like social friends that you feel a connection with their you are you pretty isolated in general are kind of how are you socially."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I have, I have quite a few friends, I feel like. You know, I have one girlfriend who kind of knows, like everything like about my health and and stuff like that. But overall, like, I have a lot of friends, it just feels hard to connect with people, to be honest, like I don't know what it is, but I just feel like sometimes like I want to try really hard to like be close with my girlfriends but sometimes it just feels like. A connection isn't there I don't know."
120.0,Provider,"yeah so I can be you know I remember being in a group once, when I was in treatment, where it was really powerful the the therapist like had a cardboard box and he likes put on people's head. box and then you're supposed to like have like conversations with people around you, you know and it's very interesting, you know when you. are talking with somebody in a box or when you're in the box talking with somebody out of the box, because it really does you know it's a weird like. Different experience and you can't really connect with them yeah and he was water is very similar feeling of like I don't because i'm in my own world. yeah and I don't know how to not really available for somebody else right yeah right, then, so it might be related to that you know."
15050.0,Patient,"I feel like. um yeah because whatever like it's literally, the thing where like I hear people talking to me and then i'm just thinking about what's going on with my."
120.0,Provider,own yeah you have your own agenda on for sure okay um. let's see what How would you describe kind of your childhood which state was mostly positive or more chaotic. Pretty chaotic okay so mainly not good memories.
15050.0,Patient,"yeah my parents were using growing up, and it was yeah it was not good."
120.0,Provider,And they were both using like mess and alcohol.
15050.0,Patient,"No my mom was my mom I said that we're using alcohol and then they they like, I said they got clean, by the time I was like three from mess, because my mom was like about to get us all taken away. So cheap stuff but continued."
120.0,Provider,Good for her.
15050.0,Patient,"yeah um and then like I said, my dad he's a binge drinker I don't really remember him drinking growing up, but. I do, he was always just very emotionally unavailable like that's just like I said he's a kind of guy who like I don't need help with emotions don't mean anything like. As long as I have hard work and perseverance, you know, like he never told me he was proud of me I think until like a couple years ago like."
120.0,Provider,"wow I bet a lot when we did tell you that, though. yeah why like why."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah I was like did you say that, like did I know why yes."
120.0,Provider,"yeah hungry for that probably what. Do you did you experience like childhood abuse, you mentioned neglect for sure, but would. You know, physical abuse, sexual abuse, as a child, no, no Okay, and what about later and are you alluded to some trauma was out from this boyfriend you kind of talked about or."
15050.0,Patient,No um it was a friend. And it was my it was in 2019 my last year of college and. We were at a party and so it's So it goes to the party wouldn't so yeah.
120.0,Provider,Like a sexual abuse kind of thing okay. And was that something that. happened like multiple claims or at one time or.
15050.0,Patient,It was just once.
120.0,Provider,"You once is enough. Did you ever reported or anything or press charges or is it just kind of trying to not think about it, that much."
15050.0,Patient,"yeah trying to don't think about it, that much."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay. um and so definitely that experience and then a lot of neglect from childhood and is your ptsd and the the the nightmares that the prisons, for I related to that stuff. yeah really quick. And then your job already. Financially, do you have what you need, what do you have, can you afford food things like that. yeah, we will not."
15050.0,Patient,"Have growing up, I really didn't so that's something that has."
120.0,Provider,yeah it impacts.
15050.0,Patient,"me yeah, but it has really affected me. Up until. Honestly, just this month is the first time, like I literally looked to my bank account, I was like the most money in my bank account that i've ever had in my entire life. So."
120.0,Provider,What do I do with this yeah.
15050.0,Patient,"I was like looking on trips to Italy, I was like should I go somewhere."
120.0,Provider,"Like I go wow yeah. yeah yeah well and it is interesting, you know when that kind of scarcity when food isn't available or when there's the resources for food, it does mess with yeah emotionally eventually that's how you grew up and. You know, with you know every you know eat your dinner you everything counts or or whatever, or you don't deserve that you can afford it whatever. Those are all things that impact it too so that's why I asked that question um do you have any legal things going on, no and what do you do for fun, do you have any hobbies."
15050.0,Patient,"not really anymore um you know well i'm going to go like. On like a hike slash walk with a friend later. um or I like to play video games. Okay, but most of time, if I have free time i'm either like sleeping or going to the gym or like. Trying to just. numb."
120.0,Provider,My brain yourself out.
15050.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,I hope that we can help you to kind of find you know reconnect with the parts of yourself that have brought you joy in the past and.
15050.0,Patient,"that's something that I really, really want out of like getting help is not even so much about like being physically healthy it's about being able to be happy, sometimes. You know."
120.0,Provider,"Absolutely absolutely you know i'm part of that is you know your brain is going to have to heal because it's in a male nurse spot right now, and so it's gonna be hard for it to feel a lot of joy because in a chronic state of anxiety based on starvation. ya know and frequently it gets harder before it gets better you know because you're going to have to face some fears of. know my body might need to gain some weight, you know need to restore so that it can be at a normal state to be able to experience joy yeah yeah but it's it's hard to have faith in that and get back it's terrifying so. um. So that's kind of all the questions I have for you do you have any questions for me."
15050.0,Patient,"No, not really like I said no, no, to ask if they come up."
120.0,Provider,"that's fine. yeah yeah so in in I O P, I do think he'd be fine for it, I don't see any on red flags or anything that would say that you wouldn't um but I will tell you about it, so you kind of know what to expect, and I want you to think, can I do this. yeah so I don't know how much you know about the disorder world first treatment, but there's basically five levels of care. And the the lowest level of care is outpatient where you go see a therapist and you see a dietitian you know, and you have, and you haven't really been done that. Quite yet, because you see a therapist but you haven't had like an eating disorder therapist or a dietitian that specializes in that. The next level is I O P, which is what we're looking at here and I op is multiple times a week so for our program it's Monday, Tuesday and Thursday and it's three to six your time because you're. And so it's basically three hours three hour block of time those and then also. You meet with an individual therapist and individual dietitian. And then those groups like one of them is a nutrition groups, you do have to eat together and they usually. As a group, come up with some idea like let's do something. We try to do something kind of challenging like one time they did something with a one time they did waffles one time they did something with me but you'd have to you know you could find a meat substitute. One time you know they do like a donut or something or something they cook together, whatever they do something to kind of to kind of stretch your comfort zone, a little bit and be like I can either do it Okay, you know or whatever, without freaking out. So, so that said there's a completion of that, and you know, and we do you know, have to monitor your wait until you do have to be able to. You know, find a time to be able to do blind weights and if you can't like go to your doctor all the time, or whatever most the time you then they'll let you go just making it to the way in and they said it destiny don't have to like some coffee. But at some other options are having a scale available to where you're you know that your boyfriend has and he kind of monitor it and send it to us without you knowing. Okay um so we can you know you guys can work that out with the dietitian level works, so you can have a scale rub it all because they're too tempted to use it, so you might not be able to do that. Anyway, so, but with I O P, you know it is freshly virtual, it is hard, because you do have to pretty motivated, because it will be extremely easy to lie we extremely easy to be like oh yeah eight and we don't know you know we're not like monitoring you and. So that's one of those things is, you have to be honest with yourself about you know or or, at least if you're not going to eat them be honest about it i'm really struggling with this, you know or and we're work with you about setting up a meal plan that's reasonable for you. guys to panic because that's not the goal. The goal is a little bit of time to help you kind of get used to a new way of doing things. But I do like to let people know that so that you can say you know if you're at a place of I absolutely you know, and so, for every anything that's scary that I can't do on my own if that's the case, then you would even higher level care. Which is the next layer or next level of care is php which stands for partial hospitalization and that's like a date program where you go every day like nine to five kind of thing, where you go there, for your meals, but you still go home at night. And, but if you like, our like also like hold on exercise all night long and just you know do that kind of stuff like you couldn't manage that you'd have to be in residential we're there all the time. So you gotta kind of be able to contain a little bit and then, so the highest level is in patient, which is like 24 seven liquids like you know, a different stuff deficient ratio that kind of thing. So we're looking at I O P, so what when you kind of hear that you see yourself as being able to do that already is yourself as being overwhelmed by that."

120.0,Provider,"So yeah okay yeah and again we you know we're in the process of wanting to help you we're not like like you know drill sergeant kind of thing. yeah you know and you're going to get people that are also struggling and so you'll have a lot of people don't understand it and are trying to have that activate also. You know, but if you know if at first you're like I can only manage one meal a day. we're going to work on adding some snacks you know or we're going to say okay to be at peanut butter every day let's have peanut butter in the morning let's have a piece of you know, butter on some on some toast and then. In addition to your lodge you need to go through like you got to have some nuts, with it, or something like that or have some kind of you know. Like you know cheese cheese and bread or whatever i'm a big cheese and bread. i'm all about just whatever. But anyway, so that's kind of what that looks like that's why i'm telling you all this, but I think that you'd be a good fit for it, I think that we could help you well, I don't see any reason why we couldn't. Eventually, if you're willing to try yeah so. Does that sound reasonable to you. yeah Okay, so what happens now, is, I just have to get back to our our team our admissions team and tell them that i'm I feel good about where you're at and. Think you'd be a good fit and then they will work on getting all your insurance stuff set up, and then we got to get the labs and ekg. And so, if you can work on that and i'll reach out to amanda and see if she can get that sent to us, and she can you can get that going. I anticipate probably starting positive Saturday, you probably the earliest would probably be Tuesday, but i'm most likely, it would be the following Monday. Okay, maybe try starting on a Monday versus a Thursday, so that you have the whole week. Okay. All right, well it's good to meet you and hopefully we'll see you."
