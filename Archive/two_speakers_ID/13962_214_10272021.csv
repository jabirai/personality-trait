214.0,Provider,hey you know I hate. I hate it. what's going on.
13962.0,Patient,lot just had a back procedures my. record my. spinal cord stimulator I guess is what they call it.
214.0,Provider,yeah how's it going.
13962.0,Patient,"Slowly a little sore today, but I go see him Friday and they actually hook it up, so I could be able to use it finally."
214.0,Provider,"And how how, how do you get to use it."
13962.0,Patient,"Is remote control, so you can turn it on and run different programs that run what they call a silent, which you don't feel or if you're still feeling the pain and it's not blocking it out, you have a remote that you can do a little sick a buzz simulate plan does. buzzes on your spine. Instead of feeling like. I guess the pain you feel more of a poll, so that little buzz. So. hard to describe."
214.0,Provider,"I know i've known people who have done it and it's almost like a tense machine it's the same concept, but its internal it's so dumb right to the. Part that's given us the most problems okay."
13962.0,Patient,"So now i've just been done with that, I mean it's hard, because you can't do anything. You know your brain you want to, but you can't bend over you can't drive. So. still waiting to hear when I can drive and do all that so."
214.0,Provider,How long is the procedure take.
13962.0,Patient,"an hour and a half, two hours. wow see they went in May two incisions put the paddles and or the cords whatever you want to call them and then. On the bottom of my back above my but they put in a it's like a battery. So that controls everything, so why that was healing their new rule is they don't want to use them, because that creates heat, so they don't want bacteria. So yeah so that's why I had to wait two weeks before I gave me try it out. So it's like getting a new Toy on hold."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I wish you, I hope it provides you the support that you're seeking will."
13962.0,Patient,It it helps so much when I had it in the last time it was great. So that was a trial period brigade so.
214.0,Provider,Okay i'm glad to hear that. um. let's just look at some of your stuff here. So how are the two medications working out for you.
13962.0,Patient,"doing good good. I feel a lot better and I having a long time my anxieties down. Like right now my old new would be going crazy person being just pissed off at the world. i'm sure everything, but you know. i'm able to manage."
214.0,Provider,let's take a look at the sermons. This one was just. So for the pH Q nine which is like depression scale. you're coming up as a three so between one and four is minimum do you think that's an accurate way of the way you feel.
13962.0,Patient,I don't. i'm not really feeling depressed right now i'm sure.
214.0,Provider,"So, so what happened was there's it there's two answers in here that have several days, so these answers trigger numbers right. Okay, so um. This is your chart actually, and this is the form you fill out. And if you look on this one here, you said trouble concentrating on things reading several days and then this one yeah feeling down depress the hopeless several days."
13962.0,Patient,"Oh, I guess what I mean several days as I think about certain stuff but I don't get stuck on it. So so yeah."
214.0,Provider,This is saying you're stuck. on it.
13962.0,Patient,"Okay, maybe I must."
214.0,Provider,"yeah so. It would probably be not at all, considering the way you're communicating to me so just this is a good way to figure out but. Even i'm a three. Three is considered a minimum, which is not. mean everybody has a form of depression that would be. everybody's form of depression. Now, when we go to the anxiety. it's a six it's not high. High would be double digits you know over 1012, so this is this is low, this is mile to do you, what do you think about your your anxiety."
13962.0,Patient,"that's probably about right, I mean i'm anxious, but not dangerous, as I used to be used to be a lot worse, so I see a lot of improvement, so."
214.0,Provider,"same thing that's medication, do you think that's medication and you."
13962.0,Patient,"know I think it's a combo I think it's you know get back to where I was and then just dealing with things now moving forward in the proper way, instead of just trying to hide everything. Very that I. was kind of ruin in me for a while, so. You know, has one day at a time, but don't get me wrong, but I feel way better and I just feel like more of the old nice coming back and. So I think there's a little, both because you know yeah the methods are going to make me feel one way, but it's not getting you know it's not the magic bullet you're going to have to participate and put. A garden for."
214.0,Provider,"And and that's the thing so when we need the medication we get the best results right if we can meet the medication by assuming that it's going to do all the work it's a failure, it just won't provide anything so it's a good outlook okay good um. How How long are you on a workflow."
13962.0,Patient,"So far, two weeks, and he said two to four weeks so i'll find out on Friday. So."
214.0,Provider,Friday visit about.
13962.0,Patient,"Friday they're going to hook up the actual the simulator, and so it works and they're gonna kind of go over me and evaluate need to see if i'm ready to go back to work or how much longer he wants me to stay home, let them feel. Because I don't know how long it. takes for your body to you know when you put the leads, and they do shift in. my previous one, they kind of float a lot more, but the. Absolute down so. i'm not quite sure that's only thing I can think of."
214.0,Provider,As you sleep habits been eating patterns.
13962.0,Patient,"Actually pretty good. Okay problem sleeping are eating, I think I gained weight too so."

13962.0,Patient,"there's a practice i'm not taking right one of them I canceled that's why I was taking Prozac let me, let me."
214.0,Provider,"know that makes sense because. i'm like okay we're ready in the 27th of the month, I wouldn't make any sense we'd be out of medications."
