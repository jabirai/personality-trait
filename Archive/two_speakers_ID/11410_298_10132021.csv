And that's a little bit overwhelming on some days. But sometimes some days at work. But some days it just felt like it was too much."
298.0,Provider,"So do you. think that there's somewhere in the middle, with. 15 milligrams."
11410.0,Patient,"yeah maybe that because some days I could I could take one in the morning, be productive and then the afternoon take another one, and still be productive, but some days it makes my brain hurt like it makes, I think, maybe i'm dehydrated and not drinking enough water."
298.0,Provider,Oh 100% you know you can definitely get somebody was just telling me that on this medicine they they get dry lips.
11410.0,Patient,"huh yeah almost like I have to do, like every other day. type of thing, because when I was doing the two it was just like my brain would hurt if I did it every day, some days I can handle it and some days I can't, I guess, maybe it's because of what I. I don't know, maybe it's just because of the hydration level because i've been trying to have it with even with those ice packs they're called IV liquid IV. And they're like electrolyte pocket they could put in water."

298.0,Provider,"Well, sometimes if i'm. I mean we definitely I would love to switch it for you and not try and try another medication for sleep and see if you do better, but sometimes if you combine trust don't and two medicines, then you're golden. Sometimes gabba penton at bedtime can keep people asleep, which is nice sleep it's really important."

My parents my grandparents, you know, I was raised around it and raised in the bars like so it's like. I don't feel like i'm an alcoholic because I, but I don't want it to get worse, especially with my older age and I sometimes I feel like I was going to say like because I feel like I have dementia, you know. Because of it. So I don't want to feel like that anymore, I want to figure out if that's what's making me feel that way or."
