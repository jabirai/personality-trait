540.0,Provider,"bye surely. Alright, for transcription That was my individual session check in with our SLE Landa i'm just some things to notate her technical. complication complications she's been having that I think since she's moved to that new place or residency so I don't know if that is going to be a barrier going forward we're gonna have to try to figure something out for connection to be able to have. Just more back and forth conversation. Just certain things that I wasn't able to hear that she was saying. I am putting in her appointments right now for next month. Slightly do that. And for her sessions i'm still going to plan on having the goal of doing the 15 to 30 minute sessions. Sometimes, she takes up the 30 minutes, but then, if things are going Okay, she does appear to kind of run out of things to talk about. I do want to know take her racing speech I feel like her racing speech is still there i'm trying to see if. That is just a baseline or, if that is connected to the mental health that she struggles with, but I do want to notate that that racing speech and just kind of everything that she talks about she really just spits out everything that she's thinking. Without being able to really have that mental filter of. Being able to talk about one thing at a time it's more of just talking and just letting it all out, and you can tell that at sometimes like she has a hard time. keeping up with herself, so I do want to notate that. All right, other than that i've been looking at all of her compliance she is in the complete green nothing looks to be. In the red right now. All right, and last thing for transcription I did just update her Karen tends to the for the month i'm just showing her medical appointments our weekly individual sessions or twice a month. group sessions. appears to be weekly right now and then monthly for drug screen frequency. Other than that nothing for transcription Thank you."
