I think it's always been that way, though, like for people who don't understand what anxiety and depression are like when i'm trying to like talk to him about it, like I don't feel like i'm getting enough like. Ignore acknowledgement, I guess, so to speak, like. Right what i'm feeling and so that causes me to kind of like shut down. Things like that. When we have like a disagreement, I mean me to also have. to work on. And so, when we like. bump heads like we're both. Hard headed, I guess, and so it kind of. It causes us both to like just not talk about this move on with it, and I know like that's not good, and I tried to Tom we do need to work through it, because we just keep ignoring it and it's not good for."

15068.0,Patient,"I don't know I. i've kind of always been anxious person, since I was younger um because I know like when I was probably about. eight or nine I can remember. There was a situation with one of my cousins and I was. I ended up breaking out in hives and like to this day, like when my anxiety level really high high I break out in hives. So it was about. eight or nine and then. Like I said I never had a my dad was in prison. I think he went in when I was about five maybe and he didn't get out until was 10 or 11. And then I was really close to my aunt and she passed away when I was 15. And I didn't have a good relationship with my mom."

226.0,Provider,"Do you feel like you have like an addiction to food, or is it just this."
15068.0,Patient,"Well, the reason I I order out a lot is because, like, I feel like I don't have enough time to cook. More either I can't focus on just preparing a meal, they have minor things going on. I can't like sit down and make the list of what exactly I need or i'm always missing some things I just. Like to skip."
226.0,Provider,Okay yeah. Does your fancy help the kids to see help around the House what does that.
15068.0,Patient,"Does I mean there's times, where we're both completely busy still like the House gets a little messy and I think for both of us it's kind of like. frustrating. When we both have a lot on our plate, and we just can't do it. For me, because i'm working from home, and I think i'm always like there's a mess like and then I really can't focus either i'm work or. And then, by the time like i'm trying to do something like I feel like I didn't get anything done."
226.0,Provider,Have you ever been diagnosed with ADHD might. not know any learning disabilities in school.
15068.0,Patient,"Now that I know of, but I know my daughter was diagnosed with ADHD and when I was like doing research to try to like help figure out ways to help her like I kind of questioned it sometimes. Especially with like the the learning aspect of it, because in school, I remember like I couldn't read passages, because I would have to like read them a million times, I still wouldn't grasp the information I was reading. Because I was either thinking about something else or. Politically, focused on what was in front of me I guess. But yeah I was never diagnosed myself."
226.0,Provider,"What was your home life like growing up was a chaotic, I was a lot of."
15068.0,Patient,"A hurry. yeah it was like I said I didn't. I didn't have a very close relationship with my mom my dad his tech OPS, for me, a lot of the time when I was in trouble, but again I was like. grounded all the time I ran away when I was 14 for a few months, and then, when I came back two weeks later that's when my aunt had passed away so it was really it was really rough and I know my mom hated that relationship, I had with her. And then I just felt like I never connected with anybody because of you know my relationship mom or even though my dad. was on my side or my desk look up for me like that relationship still wasn't like a very healthy really now thinking about it wasn't a very healthy relationship either so."
226.0,Provider,So why don't you run away.
15068.0,Patient,"And I. We I lived in France now and the school, I was going to. I don't I really don't know what made me, but I know I was in trouble, and because I was skipping like basketball practice or skipping class. didn't like school like school was not. It was easy for me and I will like I said I was always in trouble, like every summer I was grounded every single summer I always like made to. Clean the House like I had a routine I wake up, I will vacuum I would suit the kitchen wash the dishes like that was like my everyday routine and even when I did that. Daily like there was one time that I didn't do it because my mom was taking me to see the singer at some bookstores something and I got in a lot of trouble for not doing it that day. So it was very stressful and I just I wanted out, I was dating some girl, and I just wanted to leave, and so I left, I was gone for like. It was a while I want to say, maybe two months."
226.0,Provider,where'd you go.
15068.0,Patient,"I was just stayed with her and her family. But during that time, like, I felt. peace. I was in in chaos. going up to like. My. lot of my dad's family and like they did drugs, and so I feel like our home was always somewhere some a place for someone to. Like detox or get better and, like my dad was very like his family, look to him for guidance for everything like he was the oldest well, he was the second oldest but i'm like he did for everybody and. So they all came to our House."
226.0,Provider,Okay. Did you graduate from high school.
15068.0,Patient,I did.
226.0,Provider,All right. Any legal issues that we're dealing with now I mean.
15068.0,Patient,"i'm not at the moment I did go through a custody battle with my with my daughter and that's still kinda I mean me and her dad talk, but it's not I don't feel like it's where co parenting should be. That I mean we do have our our custody agreement, so we try to stick that stick to that as best as you can."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, any financial issues that you're dealing with."
15068.0,Patient,Now okay.
226.0,Provider,"All right. What okay so let's talk about some goals, what are symbols like things you want to work on in therapy."
15068.0,Patient,"As I kind of really wanted to get rid of this anxiety. Okay. I hate worrying I hate. kinda always just not being able to vote beans. I go a bit crazy when. they're. Or if i'm like stressed at work i'm like this is just ridiculous like. A lot of the times, I feel like just quitting and and and I just remind myself like you can't do that."
226.0,Provider,So when you were working with your other therapists did you guys discuss your anxiety and coping skills that you could use when you start to get anxious.
15068.0,Patient,"I don't feel like. Because the therapist I was seeing like he worked at the clinic that I was working at at the time, so I don't feel like i'm I maybe I feel like I made maybe didn't get. Like the full. I don't know the word. What I could have been getting out of therapy I guess it was more of a place that I can go and just talk, because I feel like I can't just talk to anybody. About honor what's in my head, because a lot of people don't understand it."
226.0,Provider,"alright. So I think some of the things that we can, that would be helpful for you is, you know as we meet and you'll probably in the group to you'll. discuss coping skills so. You know, some things that you can do when you start to feel anxious like breathing exercises know like you were talking about how you try and breathe through it and. Now. there's a lot there's a lot of different things that you can do for anxiety working out is also really good one. meditation is also a really good one, I mean we have to be realistic, because your your life is busy right you got little ones at home and you're working full time and so. You know let's just kind of take this step by step, and find something that works for you. We can go over breathing techniques and breathing exercises so anxiety is something that has to be managed so just like depression, has to be managed and so What do I mean by that that means that you find things that that work that decrease your anxiety. So you have to do that every single day, even when you don't have anxiety, you still have to use these coping skills that make you feel better. So it's really about like self care and doing things that are good for you and things that help you things that calm you down things that are soothing and grounding. and So anxiety is when you're living in the future. So when you have anxiety, it means that you're creating scenarios that aren't happening you're you're doing this like oh my God what a. What if this happens. What if this person does this, and then it affects me this way. Okay, so that's in the future depressions in the past, when you have depression you're usually thinking about something in the past, something that's already happened. So the goal is to stay in the present moment as much as you possibly can."
15068.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,"So it's really it's it's actually it's like retraining your thoughts so there's something that's making you anxious probably multiple things. So it's a way of stopping yourself, this is stuff we'll work on it's a way of stopping yourself and going whoa I don't need to think that. And then you bring yourself right down right to the present moment whether that's through breathing or some other grounding exercises that we can talk about. So anytime you're feeling a bit anxious, it means that you're just create you're living in the future future hasn't happened. We can't predict the future will just create scenarios about the future that are not happening. So that's where you know there's a lot of discomfort with anxiety right there's you know racing hearts, you know stomach feeling, you know just feeling like your body's like can't calm down but that's that's annoying that gets to be exhausting over time. yeah right. like an aesthetic it like almost brings you to tears because it's just so much like you're taxing your body okay. So just a couple of things that you can do until we meet again is when you start to get anxious, I want you to just put both your feet on the floor. And I want you to just feel both your feet grounded on the poor Okay, and then I want you to just start looking around the room and naming 10 different things that you see in front of you just keep naming them. that's that's a very simple grounding exercise that takes you to the present moment, so if you're naming 10 things are in front of you you're not thinking about the future. you're thinking about what is right in front of you in this very moment, and you feel your feet on the ground, feel your toes you feel your deals. And then you also feel yourself sitting in the chair you feel your back against the Chair fill your butt on the chair and you feel where your hands are. So that's Those are just you know start with that. Easy simple grounding exercises and so just you know you're noticing what's around you what's in front of you. So that brings you back right to the present moment Okay, so when you know when you start to get anxious. So you know you just tell yourself okay i'm thinking about the future, the future hasn't happened no I need to do right now to bring myself right back to this present moment right here. So let's um are there, certain days or times at work better, for you to meet with me."
15068.0,Patient,Any days day.
226.0,Provider,What about Wednesday October 13 at noon.
15068.0,Patient,On Wednesday.
226.0,Provider,"Oh, you have group that's right we can't do that Okay, what about. Okay, what about Thursday October 14 at 10 in the morning. Okay, so i've got you for Thursday October 14 at 10. Okay, all right, and then also just you know, bring some things that you want to discuss in therapy or in sessions, you know, whatever comes to you. All right, any other questions."
15068.0,Patient,No that's it Thank you.
226.0,Provider,Okay nice meeting you.
