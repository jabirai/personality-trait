I therapists will tell you i'm not ready for this crap I can't do with this right now, like you, can't just throw stuff on me like belly horrible I was. I never bothered me that much, but I was like, and it was like we're not about the car and drive her again. Last time you drove like she got she was in this situation like know what they're supposed to say to her, I couldn't do it, I wasn't ready, I was like no I was a Co op I got a story tomorrow, this is gonna be."
252.0,Provider,So you. You wound up not seeing her.
14653.0,Patient,"Nobody we drove I had to leave us, we have to go now, I have to go I don't know. What he told her whatever I don't know what he I don't know what happened, but it was fine. I was like I did not he's like I told you we're gonna do we didn't tell me anything you not term ago he said, we were leaving but she didn't say where we're going, and he fell to tell me that we were going there and other I can't. i'm sorry I can't do it, I cannot do it it's not the same, I I don't I don't want I don't want to do it, I can't i'm so sorry, and it was mad I was like. I get it, you can be mad all day long you can hate me you'd be like you're ridiculous is all kinds of stuff all kinds of music oh you're you're being a baby or ridiculous you're being over your overrated know. I have a problem, and I cannot deal with this right now i'm so sorry as part of my process, but I. ashes life like i'm always like that, like if something happens. I can't face it, like I just i'll avoid it like stuff like that scares me like. Like my mom when I was a kid my mom had a hit with a. she's playing softball with her softball team, and she got hit in the head with the ball, as you this big ol like non her head and I freaked out like. I want to talk to her, I don't want to touch her like she can hug me she was scary looking at me like a no answer so like this is day like it's like I that situation is bad like I can't. I don't want to think about I can't even i'm like dude I can't look at astro vans are you joking, right now, you think I can go see her to like, no, no. Right now, I still feel guilty just feel I couldn't do it, and then I and then he was first and then he, like had to go take a walk and I think he wasn't really sure you can deal with it either my. Do don't think you can do with this like you couldn't even do the fact that she came over one day, and he was all like. feeling all weird and guilty about it, like nah I do you want to get in the car and I was like in my mind, all I could think about was like now she's in the car and now I think about that, and now my car is like. Not the same because now i'm thinking about her being in a car like I don't know what it is, but."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you have to remember that it's a traumatic event. But when you feel able it's going to be very important that you see your friend. yeah right she was in there with you, she wasn't cause of it."
14653.0,Patient,"yeah but she got hurt the words it's not so bad like I just it's like I don't want to be like I don't want to be not strong enough to like. deal with it, like to see her and like oh wow I like freak out like I don't want to freak out because that's the whole point yeah you were hurt, but like we I was not hurt as badly and she was hurt very badly and it's like. I don't know I just feel like it's going to bring up like I don't know, I have no reason to feel guilty I didn't do anything wrong but. hey yeah man like just. I know I think her voice is what's going to is killing me as. If I hear her voice is going to like bring back that day and that's the part that i'm afraid of is like I don't want it i've seen the video so many times like. The sound of her voice just it haunts me like it just it kills me so like to hear her is like oh God I didn't want to see if, like dealing with the other, I just want to do this today, I just don't arrest my day was fine I like I had to. I don't know I isolated myself and I just I had to like draw able I was like. I just can't do it this way now I can just throw this on me how do we prepare like we're gonna go here today okay fine, but just to throw it on me like that was hard, I said i'm so sorry we can do this right now, you gotta just got a plan in or something I don't know he said to me."
252.0,Provider,He was in the vehicle with you too right.
14653.0,Patient,"yeah and he was the one driving so like he should feel like the worst i'm saying, and he did he didn't realize like dang like. Here, to go take a walk to he was like he didn't understand either just did he processes things differently, I guess, and i'm like. Not me i'm like I know I can't handle this right now, like I I felt bad that that one day I didn't go see here, I did I didn't go out there, I just I couldn't do it i'm like that's yeah I mean it is his friends were like still didn't do it, I was like it's like it's like. In my mind, I feel, like everything was fine like okay I play it, but I feel like if I see her. I actually have to live in now, I have to realize that like something bad did really actually happen. Somebody did actually get hurt, I have to process that I got that's a permanent change nobody got any permanent changes, except for her so that's why it's hard for us and the other one i've seen her, she she you know she she are. And stuff like that and she's fine like she had a whole head trauma and she's fine she's talking walking looks good everything fine, but the other one for whole life changed and that's hard like I can't it's hard to process I her whole entire life. So that's why it's hard like it's not like oh we're just gonna everything's normal no dude she's like not the same, and then. You got to think about like I start processing what happened wasn't our fault like no, it was not our fault, but I just still just I feel guilty for being able to like walk and she can like that's how that's hard for me that's hard."
252.0,Provider,that's really kind of called survivor's guilt.
14653.0,Patient,"yeah it is. Like look at her and be like oh my God like I mean I talked to them like i've talked to them, and it was like it was hard like i'm. Like mess up my whole day i'm like wow i'm just saying like wow I feel like I feel guilty and I have like i'm fat i'm like oh my today's yesterday, can do it."
252.0,Provider,"Well, a couple things. In your mind right, you have to tell yourself, you were all victims of the same thing first thing. Second thing. You have nothing to feel guilty about you did nothing wrong, you are a victim with her. um and. understanding that it's affected all of you, you all have been affected by this right it's not that you and the other three didn't have long term consequences from it, you did it's on the inside, you just can't see it. vs visible."
14653.0,Patient,"So yeah. And so positive to like I love it that she so so positive about it. Like I i'm not like that's best, though I started thinking I think it's like it's almost like why like I, this is the problem, like what the heck. Did like, why is it that I can't get over the fact that, why was I in the front seat I none of us have people's on. But yet she was the one hurt the worst like that it's like it's hard, because I know we all I know I could have like I could have died, I know that I wasn't right, I can fly out the window but. She fill out the car she flew out the whole entire vehicle from the back, like, how is it possible. But then again I tell myself, she was not in a seat, I was in a seat, the seat saved me she was not she was just sitting in the back, like just not anything so she had no support, so I had to tell myself that's what happens. mm hmm and if I if I remind myself that and i'm fine like oh hey like we're all. we're all in a bad situation, but if I just seal it out to like oh just her it's it then I start stressing like oh heck no."
252.0,Provider,"It wasn't just her and. If you think about it all right and it's all it's because of the traumatic event, of course, right ptsd. Your it is in its flying colors right and it will tell you, you know what I mean it's what holds you in that fearful grip. When you see her and you're able to say this did happen to us it happened to us, not because of us. you're going to be able to process your process to. yeah right now you're still stuck in the fear ptsd is how you over here in the fear right. yeah you have to realize that it has affected all four of you. All in different ways. Okay. But you're affected to you are changed for life over this is a car accident, not in a bad way."
14653.0,Patient,But it's my first one to like that's even worse.
252.0,Provider,yeah very much so it's definitely changed a lot of a lot of aspects good and bad okay so you've got the fear right you've been through the triggers you know what triggers it.
14653.0,Patient,Right yeah mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,But on a good note. When you get in a vehicle you're going to be more aware. and to make sure that you have a seatbelt on.
14653.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Right, these are things that are a direct result of that accident good and bad. yeah so you have to look at both sides of them, you have to tell your ptsd calm down We experienced this together. I am not the cause, I did not do this, I have nothing to feel guilty about you and you love your friend."
14653.0,Patient,"yeah I was I didn't really realize, I was I you know me i'm a block out or I block everything out, and as long as I don't think about it doesn't happen in my brain. I just like I didn't I understood in mind you're like people in movies, that have ptsd they go there and and I I didn't even know what to do, I was like I want to get the car and run I was like. No, I just cried I was like nah I ready for this, why are you first reason to this today, like. I was so mad I was like dude i'm in there before like don't you understand, like there's a process you can't like just. throw this one of her sales like oh my God talks about there but she'll tell you this is not Okay, you can just do this person I have you prepared for this at least tell me. I told you, you tell me, nothing she's coming right now, like i'm not even ready like I kind of get my like bringing together like i'm gonna start crying and like I cried oh my gosh. And I just sat there in silence, like, I was like just dry his drive on my I don't care what you do I don't care, just as he drove you parked the car I just sat there like what is going on, this is not okay like I shouldn't be feeling this way."
252.0,Provider,"it's it's not abnormal you know, it was a traumatic event, it was no if ands or buts about it that yeah all of you could have died. None of you died, and so you check the facts in at all, this is one of those scenarios, where you go wait a minute my ptsd is up front, I need to check the facts on the situation. I need to continually tell myself I don't have anything to feel guilty about I did nothing wrong. Right, we are in this together, we all experienced this together, and thank God, nobody died. yeah what did I learn."
14653.0,Patient,So yeah we'll see both people.
252.0,Provider,"And so you learn that, I mean. Thank God it wasn't a worst case scenario that you had to learn that. lesson."
14653.0,Patient,"I know I know I haven't nobody died honestly, because I was like that was on me to like that was a lot, like the other girls she could die too. I was on us like we had to like. savor like that nobody else was like we had Dan carlin top of her head like it was so hard and i've seen her. And I, and I and i've talked to her daughter, and I was like wow like I mean it was hard because, like her daughter wants to know what happened and i'm like. sitting here like that it's hard on me because i'm like her life was in my hands like it like we had to lift that thing up ourselves and, like that was hard. And I am the girl had pictures and she showed me a picture on it, oh my God, that is what you look like that night. And she took a picture of herself she wants to she look like and because she's freaking out to i'm like oh my God like so I had to relive it and I was like God, this is hard. So my God dang looks like the last piece of like part of it and i'm like Okay, well, I know it has to do with like her voice and i'm like i'll just deal with it. But dang I was rough."
252.0,Provider,"I think that you should start with having a conversation with her on the phone. yeah little small increments. your mind get yourself adjusted to. Implementing that part of it, you know what I mean you might have first phone call you guys might cry together, you know what I mean and you might get dispel a bunch of the fear that's going with your ptsd. You know, like starting little."
14653.0,Patient,"yeah I know I told him I was like yeah you saw her and like yeah she can you outside whatever as far as it but you're talking to a whole different feel like you're talking about putting her in the car like. What does that even mean like that's a lot right there like that's a whole like last time she was in my car like i'm going to start dwelling in the. House if she was in my car she was able to just get in like and now you're like got to help her in and now there's there was too much and like that that's that's. that's too much for me that's a lot like let's start with like she came over with it, I was talking, we were all corey now that's fine but you're talking like a whole life change. And I have to deal with this in my car today like no I can do that I have issues like i'll sit there and dwell on that thing for all day like and I don't think he realized that he I think he signed us up for something that. He wasn't ready for either because he had he had he was freaking out and i'm like and i'm like. You can freak out and all that she can be calling names call me like i'm a baby and sometimes you're freaking out to other yeah you are processing too. busy I don't care like he's you can talk about me all day long that oh yeah fine you're ridiculous Oh, I guess, I am ridiculous I don't care, but not."
252.0,Provider,In your neck.
14653.0,Patient,"Like i'm going to accept this, and I feel like. I feel like I was finally distantly for myself i'm like i'm on apologize i'm so sorry, but this is what's happening right now, like you know heck No, this is my car No, sorry walk I guess. You can walk if you're mad I don't care, but it's not happening today, I have a problem that's on therapy sorry but that's what I mean so uh. I have been through a lot, and he am i'm so weird because my mom text me yesterday, and she told me she's like she's like wow I was just thinking about it and I didn't realize that you've been through a lot. A lot and i'm like what are you talking about she wrote it out for me and i'm like dang almost a lot, and she went down, like all the people I believe she was like with. Your with mental case like he was like not mentally it was like issues, I guess, when I was like the first guy like he flipped out on what happened to him, but. Then, whatever he had issues and I took care of him, he didn't he wasn't this and you had this kind of guys in a narcissist and this i'm like damn a lot. Okay, just like wow i'm so sorry you've been through so much. that's all right mom and she's like any any holds together, like a champ like really I just suppress it. suppresses it, but I have been through a lot."
252.0,Provider,In your life.

252.0,Provider,"Right you can't suppress it, but one thing at a time let's not like go flooding forward."
14653.0,Patient,"Right oh yeah. yeah but then select and then I just realized too I just that really made me mad, one day, but that the guy that was I was was for seven years. He was just we were young, but like he would ever like he's stressed me out a lot this dude. I can't get over this, though he pulled me through all that this do now we're not together we're not together this dude gets married. he's having a baby now I am so pez i'm like why. I was so jealous recently I just found out, I saw it on Facebook and I was like not him like, why does he gets me like what's. Like he's like living the life I was supposed to have my How is it that we're not together and he's like Oh yes, he got married he's got the car he wanted now is having a baby. everything's going great and I like what happened in my life my life fell apart like what. that's not cool i'm like that's not that's not cool I tell them all the time, like dude you're stressing me out. i'm under so much stress i'm not gonna be able to have kids do and I I swear i've tried and I can't and i'm so jealous i'm so sad that I think probably The other day I was so upset Mike that's okay. And I tell it ago was like whatever. I just bought me. A person was like batty I felt like that you know, like what the heck is so easy for him, all of a sudden, but I was so rough for me so. I never."
252.0,Provider,"Well, I hope you know. Because, if not history will repeat itself. Oh yeah. Now there's a baby and bolts."
14653.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I hope I told myself, I said, you know what it's not good to like you can't wish that on anybody it's just I know that I, I was the one who like. helped him become like a decent person because, like obviously like he didn't have like I made sure he had a job, I was like a babysitter took care of this dude so i'm like whatever I said that's not really my problem really i'm like that's. I know that it didn't work for me he didn't work for me, so it doesn't matter if you work for somebody else, maybe it's different that's great, but like he wasn't the right person for me, so I told myself that. But dang man who got married and he said that's what I want that's not fair. So."
252.0,Provider,"You think about it in different in a different way okay so. he's married he's gotten married now he's having a baby, which you don't know whether or not, that was an accident, and that is what caused them to get married you don't know if he's done any changes, or is this relationship, going to be a repetitive cycle in the past, you have no idea. Right yeah that's true, and so is going to cause more health for the woman that he married in the baby that he's getting ready to have if he didn't get any help it surely will. And those of you. know I know that you want to. I pray God help."
14653.0,Patient,yep.
252.0,Provider,"I pray he did grow up and he's somebody different than when I knew him. yeah right I hope his child and his wife, do not have to experience and suffer the way that I did with him. Exactly you know what I mean. So it's about taking a look at the situation, all the way around yeah I. mean you, your relationship with him was shit."
14653.0,Patient,Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, it doesn't mean he's not going to repeat the cycle. Nobody really shows their their true self right off the BAT when they. meet each other, the first year, two years, three years it's like this honeymoon thing and."
14653.0,Patient,yeah. Good isn't until.
252.0,Provider,All of a sudden these little behavior start popping out everywhere.
14653.0,Patient,"You know. I was talking to this guy one time, and he was like Oh well, you have any questions for me I don't see. My no no you're fine as like no i'm good Thank you tell me about yourself it's fine so because you know you're on your a game today and I said but hey back in like two weeks a couple weeks or so your true colors are coming out so your a game today is. I gotta give it to."
252.0,Provider,"me, but this is really true, but the best way to determine somebody true character is talk to their ex. Talk to their own."
14653.0,Patient,"That is true, that is true, that is true, because, like we are like I listened to, like people story. And i'm like i'm like. Oh dude like you did I was the story i'm like so that's a pattern for you like. To be with God forever like one. story like oh yeah and then I. When I when I was a babysitter well that's a pattern like it. To my friend, like I started like dude like if you have a guy. If you got a guy like you, he was with somebody else and he decided to be with you instead don't think that that's not gonna happen to like just know. same thing, she. She ended up being with this dude and then he loved her for like like it was a pattern i'm like. dude like."
252.0,Provider,"Yes. Yes. Exactly what happens, exactly, but yet you want to know about somebody's true character talk to their ex before you get in a relationship with them. You know, are they friendly Are they not are they at war, are they not you know, does this person have bad crap to say about the risks if they do. That go away."
14653.0,Patient,for real.
252.0,Provider,"cuz you know dang well, it takes 5050 right."
14653.0,Patient,"Exactly, I think you have to tell myself mm hmm that's not good if i'm talking about him, so I had to process and, like Maybe it was me to Maybe it was a process, it was like maybe I was. To do this crazy wasn't me I go by myself, too, but I do realize that when you do talk about a person like a lot like a video with on your triangle was I was somebody else like that you, you have to realize like you're really not over what happened. Because I did I was with a guy before and he was like you must be really be scarred i'm like I am because anything like anything. Any I would bring that up all the time, like yeah this dude and you like wow. But he helped me through some stuff to he told me like you got to get over some stuff like I know so Now I hear other people they're talking about their ex husband like he played a part, though, and you had to. really just them."
252.0,Provider,"It could be as simple as. Your part, especially with an abuser. Right, they were that fit that mask very well. yeah your part, could be as simple as. not paying attention to the red flags when you first saw him."
14653.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that is red flags that they talk about that there's like there's always red flags that I tell me so there's a video on Facebook, it talks about red flags, if you avoid these have a people. Mike and I watched them and i'm like wow, that is true. make those are those are that's what flags or for go. For you just. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"You want to know the difference between your gut you know your intuition, because you have it every woman does."
14653.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,His past experience fear. Your body tells you the difference if if your gut literally is the one that is struggling like I don't care if it's butterflies I don't care if it's nervousness I don't care if it's getting upset have an upset stomach. that's your intuition telling you right if it's fear from past it's going to be your test. Your test.
14653.0,Patient,Okay. Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,"But there's the difference, so you when your intuition, is telling you there's something not right when it's coming from your gut. Okay, it is never wrong."
14653.0,Patient,"that's true I can honestly say there is a difference because I remember what like before I was like man I would always feel like that goes with he was. Like I swear he's cheating I know he took my car like I knew I knew is out somewhere, I had a feeling I put all together and, like my my son would hurt, but then like when I was with this other guy. us think about the I was like man i'd be stressed out about stuff it was in my chest because it's like a pat like it just reminded me sort of like. The other eye and i'm like dang man, but it wasn't my chest I realized, and that was just taking fear from the other relationship. So the next one, I could tell the difference if you are right there is a difference between like and every time my stomach hurts and it's like in that it's unusually right like that is the difference."
252.0,Provider,You have.
14653.0,Patient,"The other ones like anxiety and like i'm scared. Like them, but like this that intuition stuff is real because i'm not dumb I tell people all the time i'm not dumb."
252.0,Provider,"And you know. they're pretty smart and you've been through a lot so it's such a young age, but what a great life experience that you already have it under your belt, and you can learn from each one."
14653.0,Patient,yeah. they're done pay attention to the red flags haha.
252.0,Provider,attention to those red flags.
14653.0,Patient,"My mom says, I have to she's like you create people. Well, I was reading a book too, and it says that we create people. Because we don't speak up for ourselves. And then some. How. To speak up and I didn't. want it done and you just act like it you like it didn't happen. they're gonna Why would they Why would they if they treat you certain way and you're like hey. hey I don't like this don't treat me like this, whatever you speak up for yourself, they have a higher chance of not doing it, but if you just let them do whatever. they're gonna they're gonna you're creating a monster like they're just going to treat that all the time only because i'm too afraid to say something like oh all right."
252.0,Provider,"Any always have to remember, if a guy. Is cheating and you catch him. It didn't start there."
14653.0,Patient,yeah right right right.
252.0,Provider,So first time run now opposite direction.
14653.0,Patient,Oh heck yeah.
252.0,Provider,"don't give it a second or third time, because it will there will be second and third times."
14653.0,Patient,"Words I gave it, especially at the beginning, I told my gang do like it was at the beginning. He had in mind set on feels like that's not okay and that's the problem big problem. They are my my moms like. My mom i'm like I tell them like hey you know we have to say I don't even want to date anybody anymore, as I don't blame us as hard as like i'll just get a dog.

14653.0,Patient,"relationship yes. Yes, I told myself so nobody can take on all this right now, so this is too much for for a person and you can't take me on I said I have it, which they're free to do. So I thought okay I gotta at all so kind of like love, a person like I can I got a little ending so hard enough."
252.0,Provider,"yeah the day that you can look in the mirror and be completely internally okay with who you are, as a person. you're ready."
14653.0,Patient,"i'm not gonna lie like that was hard, I even did that phase where I couldn't oh my God I i've been so bad people don't even know that, so I didn't even look at I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror for like years like I would get dressed in the dark, I would get dress. I would get dressed and all that stuff without. without looking at myself, I would go I would do it, I would have avoided mirrors completely for years. I could not look at myself, because I I knew I had like I had gained weight and I was hard for me and. I was in denial about it and I didn't want to see myself, so I didn't look at myself for years and I I tried to lose weight and I barely just like my God years ago. 10 years now, and I finally like last week and stuff and i'm fine like my body shaming part but i've dealt with forever I finally stopped, so I finally got it down, where I can like I wear the clothes, I want now i'm like i'm good in my body like that was a big problem. I finally got the deal, I live close. Close. I stopped being in relationship with food that was my life oh my God I love food so much was like amazing but um I stopped like that was bad like I finally got it together the food thing. And i'm good and my body, but like oh my God So then, when it came down my brother, like my brother was like oh something like a mirror as a kid I can't do it, I couldn't do it for a long time. And so my brother worked with me and he's like I just want you to look at yourself in the mirror and smile I couldn't even do it was so hard to do. And then I finally my brother helped me through that and remember there's like six years younger than me squares like my Big Brother but he's my younger brother. And he was like you got this and I couldn't it was a hard time like being hurt by so many people I couldn't hug any I didn't like physical contact either. But I felt like I was always hugging people. And the people I was hugging and they seem like they love me but really they betrayed me or they like whatever like people, people from churches, so I thought I was pissed. So I stopped hugging people and I start hugging my mom and I realized like my mom's a hugger I shall huggers and i'm like I realized I didn't. Have like this irritated attitude about like Okay, I like doing it really I was hard for me. And I couldn't have my brother for a while, so, then my brother was he's smart he's like okay well if you can either a little things wrong me I don't like how many people are realizing it's Okay, so he did this thing, where he. Instead of hugging we take our to like we take the peace sign and we just like tap our fingers together and that was it that's all we did Oh yes, every time every time I Sam. that's all we did instead of hugging and then eventually I grew into like being able to hug them because it's hard, because I was like away from. stuff like I just did it wasn't I didn't like myself, and I was it was hard so yeah I got through that by myself alive. And i'm happy that, I mean if I had the body thing like if I wasn't that would be hard right now, all that, on top of because I raced myself to the point where I didn't. I was living. I was walking the earth, obviously, but I wasn't like I didn't see myself at all, like, I was I didn't want to see my body and I don't want to. So when I look at it like I seen pictures or videos or whatever i'm like dang I was huge like oh my God, how can anyway so hard, I was like why shame, so one last. week, I was rough and that was that again all that way in that seven year relationship with the first and and that that was hard he told me. He mentally messed me up because he told me that he didn't he said that he wasn't paying any attention. Because I had gained weight, but he was like it was against me like working out i'd be like oh i'll be on a diet him tell me not to be on a diet like he would like to eat like. pizza like you shouldn't make me fat and then he had lost weight and I had not lost weight. Loss weight and I felt good about myself, he was mad at me and then I gained weight back a little bit and then he lost weight and then he was all confident himself. And he left me fat and then he told me that and I was like, why are you like, he wasn't paying any attention and he told me that. He said that he liked that I was fat because he didn't want anybody else anyway, to look at me and like that really hurt my heart, and I was barren that hurt because I was like in my 20s like you're talking like I was dude from 18 to 24. He had all those years, and I was like I can stand myself i'm like dang so he took him seven years of my life, the other ones like I was working my way through it and other guy. One guy he just liked me because he likes that I was fat and I was like I couldn't stand it he took advantage of girls that were. Bigger I guess and that's what he would do so I was like insecure with him so like it was like I realized if I if I just had lost my weight people I would get a part of myself back where they wouldn't use me or take advantage of me that's what people were doing because i'm Nice. But. It was like i'm not used to being this big because I was never that big and I was always. Smaller in high school so like to be out of high school and then getting it was hard and then like living in my 20s like that's hard and i'm now like 29 and i'm like. cool okay i'm good i'm good i'm good now I finally got myself back on track, where like I can. I like clothes and I can wear clothes and i'm i'm not body shaming myself anymore, I can eat food and i'm not like oh I can't eat this like i'm not doing that at all, I can eat and I can I can do it all, I still eat food I just don't extra think about it, you know. cuz I was like in love with food, I was like eat pizza and like Yes, this is amazing and. It was amazing food was like Oh, I thought it was like what are we eating today now i'm like I eat I can eat whatever. But I don't think about it as much like oh it's just food, I have to eat today like it's not a big deal. So I did work through that and I didn't go overboard because my brother did like he he got sick one time off of milk. or something to drink drink some bad milk and He threw up and he kept throwing up and then after that he didn't want eat food anymore, and then he would eat food and he would throw up food and like he was all on his own. We can tell us losing weight, I was concerned, and he lost too much week, and it was hard for him to eat it was hard for them to gain weight. And i'm like I don't want to go through that I don't want to have to gain weight because gaining weight is just as hard as losing weight. So I watched him go through So for me like I checked myself like I make sure like I don't let it get that bad because i'm like. I know that is my eating is not a problem now is I could just do it, I don't have to think about it, like I just eat whatever I just know I gotta cut back if I you know I just don't overdo it. Over indulge know that helps I do know that helps with my like. Self esteem in my insecurities or whatever that weight thing was. The problem, and my mom to she's always telling me crap my whole life of. Not being overweight and crap so that just irritates me so much now i'm like man she's like oh my God you surpass me like has finally say nothing. I got my way is like oh wait that's good all right, thank you try. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"And today, you can look at yourself in there."
14653.0,Patient,"yeah yeah now actually what I do is I sit, the Carla I guess when little safe space I can't sit in the car. I feel like claustrophobic if I don't I just put the visor down. I have to open and I have to open the mirror. I have to and I looked at the whole time. Good that's like when i'm by myself in the car like i'm doing now like it's it's down and open, but in order to like see something I was, I always look at myself. So I make an effort to like I can't be in the car by myself, without looking as weird like I feel like nobody's there so. I open the visor it was a something and I opened a little thing that looks in the mirror, I can see myself as long as I can see myself i'm good but yeah I look at myself now."
252.0,Provider,"I can, is there is somebody there."
14653.0,Patient,"yeah that makes a difference because before I like I literally like even my memories like I I race so much i'm so powerful with my brain, I will erase that I will erase it for sent out I can erase a person in my life if I really thought about it, like I could just like it never happened. Like I I i'm not I tell people all the time, like. If i'm with you i'm with you, if you if i'm not with you and you think that i'm like i'm done i'm done, I will you will be eliminated, like, I will. You won't even exist anymore my brain because, like, I will erase you and I can do that I know i'm that I know I do it so like erasing my Irish myself out of my own self like I didn't even. I think back to stuff i'm like dang I did that I just forget because I don't remember myself in it, because I didn't. See myself actually I just erased and that's hard that's like that's a lot, even in college only is that wasn't a person I just went with the flow I just did it and it was done, I don't really. Give myself credit for finishing i'm doing it because I don't even remember half the time like i'm like so much other stuff surrounded that that like I didn't. I just I don't know I just don't give myself enough credit sometime like me, but you did that you did college like yeah but I did all this other stuff too, and I was stressed and so yeah and I didn't see myself, so now I look back i'm like dang now I take more pictures, I tried to."
252.0,Provider,"And when you look in the mirror. right when you have that mirror open and you see yourself in that mirror you see you, you know you're not alone, I hope that you are telling yourself that you love yourself."
14653.0,Patient,"yeah I am. i'm starting to because I. This weird because I do like my mom will tell me like she'll text me just like you know you're such a good person you're an amazing person really proud of you for taking this time to just like work on yourself, I think. It is helping I mean I know therapies helping because I use it to. To tell myself like you know you gotta love yourself i'm doing this, this is me loving myself by. doing it. Because I like right so like my dad will check my dad does this thing now he checks in on me, every week because my mom finally told him. Everything i've been going through and he didn't have any idea what any of us have been going through, because my dad's not even like. He just he's the hey guys I see comes and says hello to me because I know i've heard how together, but like I just he's like the fun dad like he just. said he doesn't really go through the offices of a mom goes through with us, she doesn't. She knows everything so she told him and he you know to do, I was like whoa checks in on every week I hope you're having a good week i'm like yeah so my therapy for the week dad i'm good i'm, just as I told him I was like maybe like because I think he should do it to. swear I think he's bipolar I think it runs in the family think we're all bipolar. will see that but, but he has the same issues I have like he you know, obviously he's been through a lot, but he I told him like I make it seem. Like I am like leading an example for everybody in the family, I guess, because I told him like i'm in it and I tell my brother, I said when you're ready, you should do it because I know he struggles with stuff too. And I said but i'm just i'm doing it first because I tell them what they wanted me in it so badly and i'm like you guys have no idea how hard it is. To just have to like process it and realize like oh dang is actually something wrong with me or I have to work through this like you. i'm the person that fixes people not i'm not the person that gets fixed so to for them, I tell them like you guys told me to sign up what I did is not easy, like I tell them I say sometimes group is not easy either that's not as hard sometimes when. I do i'm trying, because that was the first I didn't want to do it either anyone geographers like dang I don't eat group group is not for me and then I realized the importance of group, like I do need."

14653.0,Patient,"that's a really good deal I, these are like this is this is good this helps me like originally like oh group is not going to work because I was taking on other people's. Like everything everybody was talking about in group I will leave group, and I will be sad like oh my God, I was thinking about was all of them like what they're going through and how. I went to like we should all help them like like that's all I thought about like i'm fine like because I, you know me I sugarcoat my stuff. But I thought, all this is not helping me cuz i'm stressing over other people's problems now like that's really what I was like little helper. And then I kept going and then eventually like I became one with the group, and I said I understand group now I see what we all need it for and what it's for it, and now I can actually listen to people and, like. not want to like fix their problems, you know because that's what I do."
