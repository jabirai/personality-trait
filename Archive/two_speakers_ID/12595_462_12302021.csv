12595.0,Patient,"hello, can you hear me."
462.0,Provider,"Yes, I can, can you hear me."
12595.0,Patient,I can it's taken my video a little extra get started today.
462.0,Provider,No problem we'll we'll let it take its time there you are.
12595.0,Patient,"Here, I am sorry for the fighting here I swear it's."
462.0,Provider,yeah I can see you well enough.
12595.0,Patient,"Okay, good. Okay. How are you doing."
462.0,Provider,"i'm doing good, how are you how was the big Christmas trip, I know that was kind of. Top of your mind and one of the biggest goals this last time was to just try to use a plan have a plan right and communicate and set boundaries, so how did it all wind up."
12595.0,Patient,"It actually It all went really well. There was opportunity for enforcing boundaries and with jesse's mom and and, all in all, it went really, really well I my car calm down so we had to get a new car. And so that was stressful because."
462.0,Provider,That is.
12595.0,Patient,Always stressful.
462.0,Provider,It is especially in the holiday time and right before you know you need something solid.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and right, these days, especially you know the buyer is not going to get the best deals we just know it's not ideal. So we got a new car last minute and I was a little worried it wasn't going to be enough car for us for the drive but it turned out to be a great car we all fit."
462.0,Provider,"me good I know you said it was going to be a tight squeeze with the dog and all of you, but. It sounds like you kind of did what you needed to do in the moment phone the car and got yourself out there."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and we got the car we got out there and the trip went fine to drive itself went fine and. Jesse did all the driving I had a major car accident in college, and so I have a little bit of a thing about driving long distances. And so, and i'm a little embarrassed by that because I mean it's actually my car, but he did all the driving, so I feel a little bit of. Like the little woman gets driven around kind of Erica hate. um but that's. So he did the driving. The driving great and the conditions weren't that dangerous we get there and it's just our family and justice, parents and they had. made sure, so I told Jesse that I really needed that rule for no one vaccine people."
462.0,Provider,yeah That was the other thing yeah it. was a biggie.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah I told him I really needed that to be enforced, and he said, well, I can't dictate what his parents do and I can't. Tell them who they can and cannot see and I said i'm not doing that i'm not doing either of those things I just need these boundaries, so that. I feel safe so that I feel like my kids are safe and he pushed back really hard and I said I just need you to talk to your mom and tell her we really need you to keep that promise that no one vaccine and people will be in the House and we had a big argument about it. And he got up at. I don't know six in the morning and called her one morning. Because we argued about it, before moving to bed that night at 10 or 11 and when I woke up to feed Maggie and the night at five we argued about it again. And so, when our conversation was over. He just went and called his mom. And he said that she is going to enforce that rule. Firstly, because. Monty her her husband jesse's dad is in chemo and so he is yeah he has a stage four colon cancer diagnosis and so he's immune compromised and so he shouldn't be around people who are unvaccinated. And so she's going to enforce rules first one, first for him, but also for Maggie, of course, and so we don't need to worry about that it's going to be enforced and I thought okay talk sounds good, this is. Good we'll see if it actually happens right and. It was it, it was enforced, and so we get there, and their granddaughter whose mom Jesse sister kicked her out of the House a year ago she's 18 now is living with jesse's parents. And so the Nice has a boyfriend who's unvaccinated and so."
462.0,Provider,"I remember, there was someone that was. The biggest concern for you so."
12595.0,Patient,"There was someone else I didn't know that Hannah had an unvaccinated boyfriend. OK button Hannah chose to stay away all weekend she chose to go spend the Christmas with her boyfriend and maybe her dad. We don't know she left we stopped we got to see here for one minute, she got home from work we gave her a hug said hello, because we know she's vaccinated and. Then she gathered some things and then left, and I said, are we going to see you tomorrow, and she said, I might be back in the morning and then that was it and so she didn't come back all weekend. And then we found out that she was upset she said because her aunt and uncle don't care to meet her boyfriend or it's not true. it's just he's not vaccinated."
462.0,Provider,against those yeah.
12595.0,Patient,"And so. let's see what else. Jesse sister and her kids didn't come over her her son Jackson is the one we were most concerned about. he's 17 and chose not to vaccinate and things pandemic is a hoax, and all this. nonsense and. He know none of them came around which was great. that's what we mean it wasn't what we wanted, because Jackson wasn't vaccinated and no one would. Right yeah."
462.0,Provider,"I mean well, it has to be that issue right."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and then I guess it was Sunday Saturday or Sunday Jackson calls and says, I want to come over there's some tools that I need to borrow for this. Like my sister got a car, a minor car accident, I need to borrow some tools, I can fix your car. And Kathy was like Oh, we need to tidy up a little bit in case Jackson wants to come inside and i'm like that's not the agreement, the agreement is no one vaccinated people in the House, and she said, I know, but what if he wants to come inside. And I said Well he knows the rule, the rule hasn't changed and so i'm sure he's not going to ask to come inside because that's still the rule, and she was like okay okay."
462.0,Provider,hmm so you kept your. Ground kept your boundaries.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and, just in case and we timed everything so that me and Jesse Cooper and Maggie and gas would be out of the House going on a walk I like to get outside and go do something a little active on Chris."
462.0,Provider,That was one of the goals to was just for you to keep getting your walks in.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah, and so we went out for a walk and we try to time it so Jackson would come over during the walk and pretty sure he came in the House anyway. Just because there are no boundaries, the kids make the rules in that House you know Jackson was to come into Jackson has come inside and Kathy would not have been forced it. But when we got there Jackson was driving away pulling out of the driveway, and so I never saw him in the House, but I just assumed, he was there because Kathy bent that rule so quickly for him and i'm like okay that's that's where that is. So that was that was the only close call we had, and while we were on that walk I was just thinking myself what I would say, if I walked in and Jackson was in the House and how. How to phrase things in a way that held the boundary but didn't cause a total family follow because I would have been so mad, it would have been really hard for me to. find something to say that wouldn't have been explosive in their minds, like any any confrontation is explosive to Jesse and his parents. But we didn't have to do that I didn't have to worry about that because. He never was in the House that I saw. So. So that was good."
462.0,Provider,"So it all kind of came together and part of that was from you, having to communicate a lot with Jesse like you said, there was a few our arguments as you described it, that led up to eventually him, making the call and then you getting there and. It worked out, maybe he was letting the House like you said but sounds like it was at least really quick and."
12595.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"For the most part, everything was respected so. You did it you stood your ground. yeah."
12595.0,Patient,There is there's this other thing where jesse's mom finds comfort and food. it's been a lifelong struggle for her and she brings that to Cooper and so. she's trying to build a relationship with him by an all of her grandkids she does follow them. By giving him whatever he wants. Whatever treats he wants.
462.0,Provider,yeah I think you mentioned an example of her breaking a boundary was like him having a cookie in hand and being like hey Christine can can he have this like well you can't put a cookie on a kid's hand and then take it out of his hand.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and so she was just feeding him chocolate and cookies and treats all weekend. And you know we would always give super fruits and vegetables, with every meal and every snack and sometimes he ate them and sometimes he wouldn't. But there's like a bowl of candy here and the box of chocolate here just laid out its out all the time at their house and so he'll sneak things to. And it got to the point where Cooper was constipated because he was eating so much junk food and not enough fruits and vegetables and not enough water and he was in so much pain, he was little literally crying. And Kathy was starting to get ready his dinner, which we had agreed would be spaghetti something a little bit better than something fried or junk and she said, well, is he going to eat the spaghetti how about some chicken nuggets instead. And I said let's just have the spaghetti with some green beans."
462.0,Provider,good for you.
12595.0,Patient,"And she was, I think she reacted to that I think she was a little bit upset by me pushing back on the chicken nuggets because I think she."
462.0,Provider,"don't like. You know people don't like their boundaries or lack thereof right. boundaries being set basically people who don't have many boundaries themselves do not like them being said but. You had to do what you had to do in the situation for the best case scenario for Cooper, especially if, like you said he was having constipation and. needed some some vegetables and a. Nice meal that wasn't fried and didn't involve. Chocolate chocolate yeah yeah."
12595.0,Patient,And oh yeah and so it's it's hard to push back against the mother.
462.0,Provider,say what was it like for you to say that in your firm tone and just. stick to it.
12595.0,Patient,"I mean, I know it was the right thing to do, so there wasn't I mean the only way, it would have been different, as if I said it more strongly. it's, not that I wouldn't have said it. But it is hard it feels awkward because I."
462.0,Provider,don't.
12595.0,Patient,"like it when I can feel that tension with people, I just want to smooth it over and I knew the only way to smooth it over was to let her have her way. Because that's what she's used to."
462.0,Provider,Right.
12595.0,Patient,"Well, that wasn't going to happen. yeah and so it's hard to let it be."
462.0,Provider,"full attention, it is an awkward is a really good word to describe it, and something I just try to kind of tell everyone with boundaries is like. You can put that back on that i'm like you're not the one, making it awkward right, so they are in this wouldn't need to be awkward if they could just say oh yeah spaghetti sounds good you're right right, you know. So sometimes. You feel bad about it, but you can just throw it back on them and. kind of put it in your mind like hey this isn't me making an awkward this is them I don't need to feel. Bad about this right, just to you're going to you might feel bad about it and that's a natural reaction, but just to validate yourself and just again kind of throw it back on other people sometimes yeah."
12595.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,You don't have to take it all on yourself.
12595.0,Patient,I like that I. Do do that with some things but it's not the instinct for my brain to do that.
462.0,Provider,It isn't for most people you know take some work and some reframing and some again the firming yourself.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and during that during that conversation about the spaghetti and about Jackson coming in the House Jesse was also in the room, and I let there be a pause to see if he was going to step up. and enforce that boundary and he didn't so i'm like okay i'll do it, which he was also occupied other things, the time so I don't know if he wanted to see what I wanted about those things."
462.0,Provider,And he was waiting.
12595.0,Patient,"For me to respond, let me have whatever I wanted to speak up if I needed to or if he was so busy that he didn't have like maybe he just didn't hear because there's so much else going on in the room. Or maybe he just didn't want to stand up to Islam, it could have been any one of those things."
462.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
12595.0,Patient,"But, except for that little bit of silence, where he didn't speak up, we were a team, the whole weekend."
462.0,Provider,And now I was going to follow up on that because that was one of the goals was just for you to feel united and on the same page and you mentioned one time he went away for several hours and. That was something you really didn't want so you felt like a team what helped set that up six I.
12595.0,Patient,"Believe it was changes in which he did which feels wonderful that he did. little bits like little small changes that made a huge difference, it also feels weird that he has that much power to change the situation and. Such things. But he he did have the conversation with his mom before we left town, which was great and he would check in with me. Really regularly to see. You doing. Is there anything you need and there was one time, when I had been taking care of Maggie for a while and he was helping in the kitchen and. everybody else was occupied I was the only one to take care of Maggie and he would come and check on me and say. Is there anything I can do for you do you want to trade, do you want, what can I do, and he did that really regularly. It made a huge difference and made a really big difference and he would give me hugs and kisses and we cuddles at night, it was. It was everything i've been wanting."
462.0,Provider,"You know, sounds like for you, having that toolkit and that plan ahead of time was really helpful to set this up and part of it was you communicating. Those needs beforehand and him calling beforehand right, rather than just getting there and reacting and responding to each thing that comes up kind of preparing ahead of time, knowing the things that tend to come up in a tough family situation like that yeah."
12595.0,Patient,"But it was it was also just his shift in paying attention to me and seeing what I needed, I mean it was I was ready to defend my boundaries and defend myself and speak up for what I needed. But it was it was largely his difference in behavior that made a huge difference for me."
462.0,Provider,"And I am, what do you think yeah, what do you think shifted there."
12595.0,Patient,"Well, I asked him I said what's going on with you, and he said, what do you mean, and I said you've been different these last this last week, and he said in what way and I said you've been sweet and attentive and you've been cuddly and what's going on. And he kind of laughed like how silly for it to be so noticeable that you know husband is hugging his wife. But he he said he's been thinking about what's going on with him and he said that he's letting go and I said letting go what. And he said that he's been really struggling with. With work and how well he can provide for us his family he's he's super anxious about his work and. Whether he can provide for us like whether he's on a track where he's going to be able to be the provider and I said you're not your job is not to take care of us your job is to be my partner, so we can take care of us together. and West, and he sees it, I know, but that's how I feel he said he feels I mean he didn't say this, but he feels this patriarchal thing where. The man takes care of the family and the man provides for the family and that's definitely his upbringing. You know, he grew up in a little logging town that is very red very patriarchal very conservative. And he is not he doesn't fit in in that town, but there are bits that he has taken from that that he works with all the time and that's one of them. Is that you that that the husband takes care of the family and he said he let go with that and that's what made the difference in his mind. And so."
462.0,Provider,It is a lot of pressure.
12595.0,Patient,"On one person yeah it is. And again, I I love that he let go of it, and it was I mean there, there are some things about the weekend that I wish didn't happen, but, all in all, it was a great Christmas because."
462.0,Provider,"That is. A good thing right that's a good thing to hear. You were pretty worried about it so i'm glad that it turned out overall like a good Christmas. Of course, there were things you wish didn't happen, but there was also a lot of the. There sure is yeah so overall you kind of stuck to the plan and it sounds like he's had some reflection, which is a good sign that he gave some level of reflection to you right that I thought about this. Have you or would you consider at this point, any type of couples counseling to try to process through that pressure that he's you know reported to let go of and just try to kind of get. A little bit deeper with that."
12595.0,Patient,Absolutely yeah we've done couples counseling before and I didn't find that helpful he found it really helpful. I would definitely do it again if he wants.
462.0,Provider,"yeah I just before it, I wouldn't have even recommended it, because if someone's really not reflecting and pretty unwilling to engage in counseling that it's you know typically not helpful, but it sounds like there is some reflecting. happening there, so it might be a good time to try to engage in that together okay."
12595.0,Patient,Okay.
462.0,Provider,Is that something we can.
12595.0,Patient,write heart health.
462.0,Provider,Right heart doesn't do couples counseling so you'd have to kind of look within your insurance network and see what the possibilities are.
12595.0,Patient,Well that's good news.
462.0,Provider,"yeah that is that there's some again just some level of reflection and an idea where this could be coming from that's a that's a good thing, so you can keep. know just and noticing and checking in with him right, so if this the affection and all of that continues great, but if you notice that cycle happening again, then maybe try to address it or. Come back and see see where you're at yeah."
12595.0,Patient,"And I definitely, of course, still have that cycle in my head like maybe this is just a big upswing, you know, last thing a couple weeks is instead of a couple of days."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12595.0,Patient,"So I worried that that's happening, but."
462.0,Provider,valid worry.
12595.0,Patient,"I am hopeful that is you know, indicative of either real change or you know, illustrating a possibility of what it could actually be like, if you may."
462.0,Provider,"Think about it. yeah well it's it's a valid fear right with the cycle so it's worth you just continuing to observe and not get lost in the cycle, if it is in fact that. If not, again, there could be hope that maybe he's really thinking about this there's he's seeing sounds like a root cause of it, which is a good insight to have and maybe you can explore that a little bit together."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah that sounds good, I like that. I also want to explore some of the things you and I have talked about, as far as. allowing me to be happy, even if he's not doing these things, yes."
462.0,Provider,"Definitely that's I haven't glad you brought that up because, if he is or if he isn't those are still really great things for you to be developing and continuing to develop a relationship with yourself so. How are you as far as postpartum and ability to travel rock climb engaging in some of these things are start thinking about it. So."
12595.0,Patient,"Travel I I feel is still really restricted just because of the pandemic. yeah but my sister and I talked about a sister trip. So i'm in the middle of three, and so my sisters and I are all pretty close I think i'm. The closest to either one of my sisters i'm the middle. and sisters are not that close with each other anymore."
462.0,Provider,Little card.
12595.0,Patient,"But we all generally get along really well, as you know, surprisingly well for three individuals were very different. But we've talked about a sister trip and we're aiming for maybe summer 2023 so in a year and a half."
462.0,Provider,"Great so there's plenty of time you don't have to play with the pandemic and it's something to look forward to, and you can take plenty of time to plan it."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and yeah look looking forward to it, because for me that's a big part of it is not necessarily getting to do these crazy fun adventures all the time, but you know, maybe just one every once in a while and. Have that build up time to look forward to it and planet and I think about how much fun it's going to be and I love that part do so that build up partners is fun for me."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well that's a good thought and was directly related to what we were talking about as far as you just either taking a trip alone or a girls trip or sisters trip or something just to kind of. Do it and enjoy it um so that was that's a direct plan and a direct idea for that goal, so nice job as far as the thought process there."
12595.0,Patient,And then I also want to plan more outdoor stuff this year more backpacking trips camping trips because that's not restricted by the pandemic and.
462.0,Provider,that's one of the nice things is that outdoors and still take.
12595.0,Patient,"Yes, and the the trick is going to be doing that, with a newborn meaning either take the newborn with us or figure out how to leave home and not affect my milk supply. And so either one of those things, I think I mean i've talked to friends who brought their newborns on camping trips. it's possible. it's tough, of course, but any trip with a newborn is tough."
462.0,Provider,yeah there's some people are really into that and that's something where maybe there's gotta be some type of a Facebook group or something for backpacking moms.
12595.0,Patient,Yes.
462.0,Provider,"I found that where you can. yeah i'm not surprised so that's something where you can decide right if that's you would want to bring her or, if you would want to figure out a way, as he said, with milk and everything to have her stay behind."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah so that's that's something I need to think about I kind of want to talk to Jesse about it, to see if he's interested in going on that trip, but then I also. want to just have a trip without him partly just to prove to myself that I can that I don't need his home planning trips. And then it's going on, and I can do something, besides just a family trip."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12595.0,Patient,"Because that was always my goal is, I wanted the family trip I wanted you know and. The husband and wife and the 2.5 kids in a."
462.0,Provider,"row and you're a little let down, sometimes by him not wanting to to plan that. So maybe you just keep reflecting on that a little bit and decide and do some research right and see what would look realistic as far as bringing or not bringing telling Jesse you're not telling Jesse and. Maybe you even start with just a hike like with the baby and Cooper or just you and the baby or however you want to arrange it right, but maybe you just start with that and kind of. see what that's like alone just a small step, something similar."
12595.0,Patient,"That sounds good, and I can do those i've done those before."
462.0,Provider,Right.
12595.0,Patient,"When it was better that Jesse was not into this stuff I I would make my own trips, I took a whole spring break all on my on my own, without leaving town, because I would go hiking here on one day and snowshoeing here on another day and I just made a whole. turn on my own, and it was fantastic I went trail running one day."
462.0,Provider,awesome.
12595.0,Patient,"It was so much fun. And so I can know yet, but it's been a while, so I should I should test all that off."
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah so maybe start testing that off a little bit and kind of think about what would be a small step forward or a small step closer to that, whether it be."
12595.0,Patient,"Oh, your sound kind of."
462.0,Provider,"you hear me. Yes, yeah yeah so that's a good thing to start thinking about how you can kind of dust that off and move forward with that. idea of a full backpacking trip, but then also some of the things you can do locally, that will start warming you up a bit to it yeah I like that."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's going to be a big deal for me is just developing the hobbies and activities and and friend circles outside of Jesse so that, if and when the cycle starts again I don't feel quite so alone."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that sounds like a really good plan, and you can be again aware of the cycle not get dragged into it. enjoy the good things that are happening, but still continuing, because, regardless in a marriage, if it's a great marriage or things aren't going well. it's still important for everybody to be building relationships with themselves and have their own inspiring activities and hobbies so. That can just be separate regardless of what's going on you're still developing a relationship with yourself continuing to do the things you enjoy check in and have a couple of things that are just for you and don't involve him and that's very healthy and very okay."
12595.0,Patient,yeah okay. yeah and I already have. A climbing date with my friend so we're gonna.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, great."
12595.0,Patient,That backup. not delivered next week.
462.0,Provider,awesome that's super fun and social so.
12595.0,Patient,"Yes, I know both things all in one my friend and my friend Alice that we saw in Oregon over the Christmas break. We met in Grad school and so we've known each other, a long time because it's the first year of Grad school and gosh I was 16 years ago so we've known each other gosh I was a long time i'm."
462.0,Provider,telling me.
12595.0,Patient,"um she's the one who got me started rock climbing. She wanted to go rock climbing for her birthday that year. And so that was the first time I ever went I was like sure i'll try it for your birthday, and I was hooked right from the start, and she said that she got through the pandemic because. She boy baby monitor starting to rumble a little bit. She said that she learned, there were two things you really need in order to keep your sanity for at least for herself and she read that it's true for a lot of people exercise and the social connections and when you exercise with a friend it combines the two and so."
462.0,Provider,yeah you're getting. Extra doping me.
12595.0,Patient,"So, having the exercise I think of them as playdates exercise playdates."
462.0,Provider,It is.
12595.0,Patient,it's really useful it's best of both worlds.
462.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so we can keep that as a goal as well to just right you've got the date set up so to follow through with the date and keep trying to have those exercise playdates because adults actually need playdates and play tennis shoe and climbing is totally a form of play."
12595.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah I think of it as puzzles to.
462.0,Provider,me.
12595.0,Patient,doesn't leave your body for your home. yeah yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah okay so that's a lot of really good stuff do you when are you going back to work, do you have a date."
12595.0,Patient,"I think the date I specified was. A specific date, but the second week of March."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right all time."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah I have about two more months, little more than two months. and i'm feeling good physically I feel great I feel ready to go back to work i'm glad to have the extra time to rest and."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
12595.0,Patient,You know the mega she is so amazing she is such a SMILEY baby and they say that they don't typically start smiling for real you know smiles not connected to gas. They don't usually start smiling until at least. two to three months old. But she is smiling.
462.0,Provider,SMILEY baby that's that's awesome that's beautiful so you're enjoying the process which is important to another thing that was. Something for you was just kind of the nighttime duties letting them with Jesse communicating that kind of texting each other from different rooms how has that been going.
12595.0,Patient,"it's been going well, he is making choices that are making it difficult for himself to get enough sleep but. i'm still sticking with our agreement, like last night I woke up at five in the morning because Maggie was starting to make sounds. And I look over and jesse's awake and looking at his phone probably scrolling through news or something and I said, why are you awake and he said Oh, he couldn't sleep and. Like you're going to be awake in a minute anyway changing a diaper, why not just try to go back to sleep and can I have talked about maybe him trying meditation. In the middle of the night, if you can't get back to sleep and I don't know if you've actually tried it or not, but. And he was awake I don't know for how long and then 15 minutes later Maggie woke up and then another 10 minutes later after I fed her, she needed a diaper, and so I came back into the bedroom and woke Jesse up and he had finally gone back to sleep in that 20 minutes. And so, he was crumbling about oh I just got back to sleep like No, this is their agreement and I don't feel bad."
462.0,Provider,it's kind of like what you're talking.
12595.0,Patient,About a little bit ago about how it's not on me miss on him if he wants to make that choice.
462.0,Provider,"Right, we know that blue lights and phones don't help with sleep, and that is that was his choice to kind of be up and on his phone for a while, so it is a thing you can throw it back on him that was his choice you can't control his choices, and this is the agreement. he's done that diaper duty so. yeah yeah."
12595.0,Patient,"And it's it's hard because he's cranky because he finally got back to sleep, and I could have changed a diaper on my own, but I didn't I asked him to change it. And then he doesn't get very much sleep because of that or in his mind he's not getting enough sleep, partly because I asked him to change his diaper and so he wakes up cranky when it's finally time to be up for the day he's cranky. And he thinks it's because of me and so he's a little bit cranky at me. But it's what he agreed to, and so i'm. moving around this House thinking that's all we agreed to i'm going to act like everything's fine because we stuck to the plan, and I was."
462.0,Provider,"yeah as you should. it's right it's not fair for it's it's not fair it's not your fault, and it to people make a baby, in this case and you're splitting the duties."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and. I have man, this weekend I noticed that his mom does the exact same thing, where there's something that will make her a little bit cranky and it brings in all these other feelings. she's mad about all these other things, and then she picked one of those things out of the pile and directs her frustration at that thing. And I think jesse's frustrated at a whole bunch of stuff and then he picks the fact that I asked him to change a diaper for five minutes to be the thing he's cranky about. And i'm sure that he doesn't see the parallel and how he reacts and how his mom reacts to things because he hates it when she does that. And he does that too, and he you know he makes choices that makes things harder for him and i've told him that, before and. He doesn't really see it that he's making those choices and those choices are making it harder for him, but I can't do anything about that."
462.0,Provider,You cannot that's that's things that are out of your control and so all you can do is kind of throw it back on him and not have to take on those emotions yourself.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and you know if he creates an environment in the House or it's I I describe it as just being dark clouds it just. feels like. there's dark clouds and. All over the House I either ignore it, or I get out of house and I go do something."
462.0,Provider,Where I don't have to be right in.
12595.0,Patient,Our clouds.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so whatever it is that you do a good responses just trying not to get sucked into the dark clouds yourself right stand separate that that's him that's his. way of being at the time, and you can you do not have to be a part of that you can throw it back on him and, as you said, ignore it or leave."
12595.0,Patient,"And the really hard part is when that lasts for days when his bad mood goes on for a whole day morning tonight or into the next day, and it, it does take energy for me to resist joining him in that mood. And so, when it goes on for a day or more, I get. frustrated and annoyed."
462.0,Provider,that's very understandable because that's I mean that's a long time for that to go on at some point you're human and it's hard not to take it on and it's not fair for you to be in that have to be in the dark cloud environment.
12595.0,Patient,"yeah so that's the hard part is when he gets in those moods he tends to stick there for a little while. And I try really hard to not get in there, but sometimes it's really hard to not joined in there."
462.0,Provider,yeah there is a certain point that if you said it goes on for days you're only human and it's hard to be around that for so long.
12595.0,Patient,Do you have any suggestions for how to not join him they're.
462.0,Provider,"Just like you said getting out of this physical space, so not being not being there somehow right whether it's getting out for the day and going rock climbing or I don't know. You know spending the night at a family's House I don't know if you have that option. Have you confronted it and said hey there's dark cloud here this isn't fair, how can we shift the atmosphere."
12595.0,Patient,yeah I i've asked him about like what something is clearly up with you and he's he sometimes he says no i'm fine like that i'm like really clearly you're fine.
462.0,Provider,"Right, well then there's the bigger picture of at some point you're choosing to accept that this is. How he is, and you can try to cope with it right, but there is a level of okay i'm choosing to be here, so I have to just get through it. try not to be a part of it use my coping skills, or is this a deal breaker right Is this something as he said, where you would want to consider leaving the relationship over it, because it's unhealthy yeah that's a good point."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah I hadn't thought about that. So that's you think that's a severe enough thing that it might be in the realm of a deal breaker for some people, at least."
462.0,Provider,"Well, if there's days, where it's like there's a dark cloud, and someone doesn't take responsibility for it, or you try to communicate about it and so i'm fine but yeah absolutely that's not healthy it's not healthy and emotionally healthy atmosphere. I think we talked about emotional safety that doesn't set up emotional safety, where a conversation could be had and it's consistent enough, then yeah."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah yes, it did talk about emotional safety a little bit. I didn't tell him, it was a phrase I got some counseling because I didn't want him to feel setup or. Their singled out or anything but. I did talk with him about it, about how I don't feel safe, you know someone responds in certain ways that's not a safe environment and I don't feel like I can be vulnerable to a person that treats me that way. So we did talk about emotional safety a little bit. And I think at that point, I there was something his mom was doing and I pointed out well, this is what you're doing to you're doing the same thing that to me that she is doing to Oh, I remember what it was he had he had gotten a Perm when he was in junior high. And he's embarrassed by that but his mom brings it up every once in a while, like every year, so she brings it up, and this was you know 30 years ago and she brings it up, knowing that jesse's embarrassed by it, she still brings it I."
462.0,Provider,said she kind of has that little bit of a bully and making fun of people tendency.
12595.0,Patient,"Yes, and. But she knows it and embarrass him, but she brings it up anyway, and she claims to have forgotten that he's embarrassed by it. And he he said well that can't be true because i've told her about it so many times and I said does that sound familiar, because there are things that he does to me says to me. That i'm told him I don't like, but he. Does many way, and he claims to have forgotten that it's an issue, and so I said you're doing to me what your mom does to you and you're so mad at her that you don't want to talk to her for a long, long time imagine how I feel. And he kind of pause he's like yeah Okay, I get it, I get it. And that was around the time when it seemed like a switch had flipped for him and all of a sudden he's like Oh, I get it, I will give my wife kisses."
462.0,Provider,"magical right well yeah This is something you can just continue to monitor and reflect upon again like there is a certain point where it's your own. You have to take some responsibility where you're saying Okay, I know this is what it is and if it's not going to change then i'm accepting it and what all you can do is cope with it, try to leave the House, but there is a certain point where. You know what to expect, and so, if you can live with it and cope with it great, but if not think about again what the other options are."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah and I I definitely feel like i'm in a state of choosing like a shifting state right now, where it is clear to me that it's a possibility, this is never going to change, and I have to choose whether i'm okay with that right."
462.0,Provider,And so it's a hard place to be.
12595.0,Patient,yeah and i've been in situations before where I had these large decisions to make or large changes to make and to me it feels like turning a barge like it's a very slow.
462.0,Provider,process yeah yeah.
12595.0,Patient,And so that's kind of what it feels like is happening for me like i'm deciding and. Settling into the decision of which way i'm going to choose and it feels it's feeling like a very slow process like the realization of. The. Of the situation of the reality of the situation it's it's taking my brain a little while to settle into that.
462.0,Provider,"it's a big thing to confront it really is right and part of it is because it wasn't always like that, so it can feel unreal that this is where it's been and where it's at right and then also just the. level of personal responsibility like he said Okay, this may never change and it's actually your own responsibility to choose, if this is. something you can be in and be safe or not and that's a really big decision, so the slow turn was a really good analogy and it's okay to go slow with it because it's actually better than impulsively deciding."
12595.0,Patient,"yeah that's good to hear. yeah and it's, it is hard to know that it's it is on me, I mean I know what it is, I know insinuation is. I know it's really hard for people to change at all, let alone, making big changes, like the ones i'm asking of Jesse which is basically change back to who you were you know six or seven years ago and. mean people can't change back, but i'm just. i'm asking him to change and that's. that's really hard and i'm basing a lot on his ability to change. So yeah the personal responsibilities. yeah that's hard."
462.0,Provider,"Probably one of the hardest pieces of it is that personal responsibility and it feels so unfair because you shouldn't have to be alone in a partnership right kind of. Thinking through this, but it is, it is the reality and, as you said, you're starting to just kind of peel back the layers and confront it more and more, which is a good place to be either way you go at least you're doing some of the work to try to get to a a better and safer place yeah."
12595.0,Patient,yeah and in the meantime we'll see if. Jesse might want to do some couples counseling.
462.0,Provider,"Now that could be another good place to go if there is a little bit of a shift there a little bit more reflection and openness. Okay, and then just continuing to focus on those other goals that we talked about primarily and particularly you getting out and doing the things you like again the climbing the adult playtime."
12595.0,Patient,yeah that all sounds good.
462.0,Provider,Okay alright so let's get you scheduled.
12595.0,Patient,can't believe we got through the whole appointment Maggie say to sleep.
462.0,Provider,yeah she was like I know mom needs. i'll give it to her.
12595.0,Patient,She is a talking baby and so when I heard her making sounds she must have. kind of in moving around a little bit and inside.
462.0,Provider,"The sleep. All right, are you available on Thursday that."
12595.0,Patient,"I am, I do have a doctor's appointment that day me see what time, that is my doctor's appointment is nine to 10 so anytime except for that hour."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to do noon, is that enough time."

462.0,Provider,So noon on Thursday the 13th.

Okay well we've got to January appointments coming up i'm so glad that at least you know you were able to get through Christmas and enjoy yourself and have a good time, overall, a big part of that was just your communication and action so nice work."
12595.0,Patient,Thank you.

12595.0,Patient,"It went about, as well as can be expected for. A family trip there perfect."
