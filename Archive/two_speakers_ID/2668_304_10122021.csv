And I know that's kind of hard to to like stay away from like the carbs or sweets or things that like you think would be sort of a quick pick me up but they're really not the things that like energize you."

You know, looking at your your eating habits like looking at your sleep. If you, you know your hobby secure creative you know spending time with family like just kind of almost giving yourself a little bit you know talking to your sister and. You know that was a sad thing but sounds like you're really trying to support her through that so yeah I think focusing on you know, focusing on work, of course, to just kind of. All all the all areas of your life, you know."
2668.0,Patient,yeah yeah. drink your water to.
304.0,Provider,"Water all I know that's my struggle to you, you know so many of my clients to we're talking about these things yeah just something as simple as drinking water, but it's hard for me to get all my water it for today, so I understand, but that makes a big difference yeah I think your energy. yeah."
2668.0,Patient,"Like oh I bring in like too much sleep to on the weekends only because I can't during the week. So I just been trying to set instead, like several alarms. To. 30 minutes apart like at 10 o'clock and then 1031 1230 on the weekends."
304.0,Provider,Okay. So normally sleep till.
2668.0,Patient,"yeah the press to Oh, a couple of weeks yeah but then I feel like that, because then it gets darker oh no quicker so it's like a waste of the day."
304.0,Provider,"Yes, well, and that is hard Office, if you get too much sleep you feel more tired right. yeah so it definitely I think trying to. Just. Like go to bed I know it's like so tempting to try to get that extra sleep on the weekends, but yeah to try to like wake up and go to bed as close as you can't the same time, every day. Just because that's yeah what your body's used to so."
2668.0,Patient,"yeah like I know, during the week is good, I go to bed between 10 to 10:30pm and then wake up at 530 or six every morning."
304.0,Provider,"But that is the early, though. yeah yeah so I you know I would say yeah he slept in a little bit, but that's a significant. amount right likes if you're used to waking up at 6am and you sleep until noon that's six hours you know yeah so maybe you, you know if you sleep in a little bit, but try to. Like you said."
2668.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm gonna do that this weekend and then see how that goes um I guess like and then, if I wake up good like at 10am, then I want to like my goal is to wake up at 9am on the weekends. I think that's a good like wake up point on the weekends."
304.0,Provider,"yeah definitely yeah kind of make a plan. and try it see how you feel. As if that helps you have more energy. And then that gets you like it probably would be hard to wake up for work on Monday, if you're so you know what I mean like if you're used to sleeping in that much on the weekend, and then you got to turn around and wake up at 530 or six."
2668.0,Patient,yeah it's always a very hard one day yeah.
304.0,Provider,"Sure, I bet. So if yeah, especially now to it's. Like staying darker yeah well you know later i've had a hard time waking up in the morning, oh it's still dark. yeah. No, I hear you.

304.0,Provider,"Okay, good well yeah you know just keep keep working with him to kind of let him know just how you're feeling on that new dose as you take her down but yeah, I think, as long as you're doing it gradually hopefully you'll you'll see less and less of those changes. yeah and i'm so sorry Jennifer i'm just on my way to pick up my daughter so i'm so sorry i'm driving but. If you want, I was thinking about, because I know you said yeah to Caesar kind of tricky for me, because I have other groups, and now I have to go pick up my daughter for preschool but.
