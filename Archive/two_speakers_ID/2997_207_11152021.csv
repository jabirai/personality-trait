207.0,Provider,"Okay um did you ever talk to your doctor about like you know you're helping and doing whether the nicotine, not the patches where the specifically than occurrence or anything. funny and that's a good thing if you're able to manage it, the way you are up until this point in your continuing to. get through it, then I will definitely say continue to whatever is working for you that's good do you find that your anxiety level level has decreased the great bully or it's on. And how are you i'm because when you think about smoking a lot of that is due to our generalized worry and anxiety and so, how are you able to get through a lot of that like how are you personally finding the effective for you to work through it."
2997.0,Patient,"I really do anything different I mean I just. Stay busy and stuff, and I mean. i've picked my nails a lot that's probably not good, but I mean. I just don't think about cigarettes, I mean that's. Like I get nervous or something happens I just. not think about that."
207.0,Provider,Okay. Okay well that's good I mean that's good overall. Do you find like any struggles that you had lately or have encountered.
2997.0,Patient,"Now I mean other than just like one day like get off the box stuff like like I mean it's not really a struggle, but I mean it's not like i've tried or anything yet, but I just did I just want to eventually try to get off of it, I just like feel like I. tell myself I can't I can't get off of it, but I mean haven't even tried so."
207.0,Provider,"What specifically when it comes down to the suboxone, what is your generalized concern when it comes on to."
2997.0,Patient,"me, I mean i'm not like i'm not scared that i'll go if I get off it go and like start using again or anything like like i'm not scared of that I just i'm. Just scared to like be sick. of it."
207.0,Provider,"So you're you're scared of the possible side effects. um okay and that's and that's a natural um you know concern when you think about the possible side effects um, but let me ask you this um. What specifically like what side effects is more scarier for you."
2997.0,Patient,"And I mean it's, just like the thought of like just being like sick like in going to work and stuff I because I grind Now I do my medicine like I feel normal like I just. I just feel like dope sick again like being like cold like runny nose and stuff like like just like. You happen to go the bathroom basically same stuff that. Like when I was on the heroin stuff is pretty much the same way, but I mean if I taper off of them i'm pretty sure that all that would. not cause any side effects like but."
207.0,Provider,"uh huh uh huh and so and and maybe what you can try is, and this is something that you can definitely talk to Julie about is how much, are you on right now."
2997.0,Patient,"To a day. i've been trying to like cut back, like specially since i've been working in like oh like try to go and like just do like a half one in the morning and half on during the day or at night when I get off for it and so i've pretty much only been doing, like one a day and. Like something like on the weekends and stuff I do like to but I mean like while i'm working I usually just do like a half in the morning and then. A half when I get off just some trying to like cut back as much as I can want to eventually just like keep going down like to do like a fourth in the morning or. The evening and just keep trying to cut myself back, but."
207.0,Provider,"Oh so so think about it in the same manner in which you, even with the cutting back of the cigarette or the. The marijuana if you think about it in that same manner and how you cut yourself down from that or decrease your usage it's in the same way that you can try it with this box and so, if you're on you said you're a total on how much a day. Okay, too, but what is the the milligram."
2997.0,Patient,A milligrams.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so it seeing how you can cut back, whether you start off with whether it is you start off with one less per day, or just you know talk to talk to. Julie, about how you can do that effectively. I would encourage you to talk to her, how you could do that effectively and that if you're having with rush you could help with you know, making recommendations about doing it where you don't go into. You know, having a relapse or start going through the harder cravings or the withdrawal symptoms. I had somebody now who's been doing it for a while and down. To like four, but now it's, to the point where they. They go days without taking it, even though they're still for withdrawal, but they go days without taking it in and. it's. All really yeah yeah so it's really coming from a coming because a lot of it honestly Logan a lot of it is mental a lot of it is mental. You for a long way you come a long way with you try to school me about how marijuana is effective and it's true it's known to do this, and so you've come a long way. And so it took your determination it took a lot of your willpower and you saying hey I want not to be a slave to the substance, but I want to be free and independent, and so I think if you just continue with that same um you know. tenacity, that same confidence within yourself and just wanting something different. You can get through it i'm not saying that you're going to go through withdrawal, but it is you learning how to it's kind of like when you cut back from smoking and kind of the withdrawal from the nicotine, as you slowly went through that and it seemed during that. Because a lot of it is endurance endurance is always what. helps us to get to the finish line it's in the endurance i'm running i'm running a mile and my body is saying you need to cut it out, you need to stop and you endure you you pace yourself, you learn how to regroup and paste yourself and continue and before you know it. you're there yeah but if I sit here and I think about what's going to happen, possibly going to fall. fall over you know i'm going to do if you start thinking about all these things we have increased. A lot of those withdrawal symptoms, not to say they're not real they are real and will you be faced with them, yes, but if we take our own power and wealth. and work through it all you can get through it, so I would say talk to this to the to do me about it and then she'll let you know the most effective way to go through it. Okay. Let me see if I could schedule you for next month. To 30. Have you the 13th at 230 okay. All right, then so have a good time."
