That needs to be done, because he can't keep going through this I mean every day he thinks he's so scared he's going to end up in a wheelchair, and he feels like it's going to be soon, because he can hardly walk anymore.

And they started putting they put me on values, and I was on those until I was about 16. I stopped taking them and I didn't take anything for a long time, but I was snorting coke I was freaking drink and like it did a sieve. i'm a real alcoholic I was an alcoholic for you.

They almost put a straight jacket on me, because I was the team, I was showers and eating that there were snakes and rats. yeah crawling all over me. And I kept climbing at my my skin and my arms and my legs and I was screaming and crawling into a corner trying to get away from all these things that I was hallucinating. Sure, and after that vibe that was on for about two weeks, and then after that I just had to go through the physical withdraws. The shaking of the hands the nausea the craving I mean God the craving was so intense."
527.0,Provider,yeah How long have you been drinking by that time.
3731.0,Patient,"God I started drinking when I was like 14 by the time. I I was 18 and I was a full. On out. it's like I had to have alcohol and I was a tequila drinker I. I hated face to beer, so I always buy these I had blessed. In a laugh laugh because. I have those. All over my house all over my car I even had one in my pocket at work. When I go. go into the bathroom going to install and take a couple of drinks, you know just to keep myself functioning."
527.0,Provider,For the day Sir sure.
3731.0,Patient,"But after I went through the detox I came out a month later, and I was clean and sober and I haven't had a drink sense."
527.0,Provider,Okay wow good for you.
3731.0,Patient,"I was 18 years old, so."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
3731.0,Patient,"it's been years since i've had alcohol it's. I don't even create it anymore I don't even. People asked me if I want to drink and I know, thank you. i'll take. My glass of milk, give me give us."
527.0,Provider,What yeah I was gonna say what what was the driving factor for you at 18 because that.
3731.0,Patient,"was like my own, I left. I was 14. Okay, and a fake ID That said, I was 18. I got myself a job I got myself an apartment but I mean I was still a kid. And every but that's what we did in the 70s."
527.0,Provider,You drank.
3731.0,Patient,"You know, or you did LSD or you smoke pot, and I didn't like pot, because it made me dizzy. Like being dizzy so I drink, I mean, I had a girlfriend she's my best friend from the time we were love we're about 12 years old, when we met, we started drinking about same time she's her parents are drinkers. And there was they had a fridge rater in the dining room the headache keg on the side of it."
527.0,Provider,Oh wow.
3731.0,Patient,All day long and her parents were always gone at work so we'd always hit the liquor cabinet and the beer and Aaron anything else we could get our hands.
527.0,Provider,On yep.
3731.0,Patient,"So, by the time we were in our teens are pretty much full on our keys. Sure, and I like tequila because I don't like the taste of booze. Take it, I mean i'm sure you've taken a shot of Bourbon or something like. That and it burns your taste buds and you really can't taste anything after that. yeah that's why I drink tequila I can take one shot my taste buds with done the rest of night it tasted like water. drink all night and it didn't bother me a bit better. Here at beer, it was like horse piss with bubbles. yeah. But. Once I stopped drinking I. pretty much got into the cocaine and did that, for a few years and then one day I did it and I got paranoid I before I never got Bernard I just enjoyed the high, it was a. nicer now oh hi you know, but then one day I started acting like my ex husband staring out the window at every little noise you. Know paranoid out of my mind and I hate. I hate being paranoid I hated when he did it, so I just I didn't do it anymore I just stopped and I didn't have any problems stopping coke or math. I was on metro good 1520 years. Okay, like I stopped, just like that the only thing I had to do was stay away from the people that did it I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms. But I also didn't smoke it. Nice snorted it. And it seems I think there's a difference. Because most of the people that I knew that smoked it they went through withdrawals when they stopped. or when they didn't have it. You know, but me I didn't withdraw or feel sick or anything I just you know wanted more I just had the. creature and it's like pretty much if you just stay away from the people that do it, I didn't have the craving anymore I. it's been since 2005 well I add a line of code of math. I didn't need it, the reason I got into the program was because of the opiate addiction. share, and that was just stupid I got because of him having pain pills all over the place it's. Like and I fell off of a two story ladder at work, one day. And I fell on a cement slab and I got my foot, you know those to the ladders or the stairs that they have in factories, so you can get up on the top shelf. Yes, I was climbing one of those up on one of those and when I came down my foot slipped into the wrong instead of. yeah and I went backwards my I tore my leg up, I was in a boot for like six weeks I cracked my tailbone. yeah bruised my kidneys."
527.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh yeah."
3731.0,Patient,"I was messed up pretty bad and of course they gave me methadone. And, but they only gave me a week's worth and guess what that's all it takes. A week to get addicted to that crap. Yes, so, by the time the week was up, I was addicted and I started getting withdraws and Steve had extras that he had had hidden away."
527.0,Provider,and
3731.0,Patient,I was taking those without him even knowing it.
527.0,Provider,"Sure, and."
3731.0,Patient,Then I ended up having to tell him because I took them all.
527.0,Provider,You know.
3731.0,Patient,"And he saw how bad my withdrawals were and how sick I was so he was sharing his meds with me, which was you know made me feel terrible because I know he needed a more than idea."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
3731.0,Patient,"that's when I got into the program the metric used to be the manager here, he was in the program and he gave me one of his boxing strips one day. And said, take this it'll make you feel better, so I cut it in half, I took half of it and I felt better, just like that I. wow God what is that shit. He said it's called some box and he goes there's a program down at the clinic he can get in i'll give you his inbox and to keep you from getting sick and I went on there, I was down the next day. wow and I went in I saw Tony. Scott, I think his name was was the nurse that she had at the time, but I had an interview with them and within two days I had a prescription for some boxing. wow and but I wasn't taking the whole eight know Graham strip. Show I was supposed to take three of those a day when."
527.0,Provider,I didn't.
3731.0,Patient,"Because that was just too much I didn't need that much. You know, so I just nip a little piece off of it, and that was all I needed. Sure, I was, as I was taking them the longer I was taking them, the more I needed. And I I can't stand the taste of the strips they taste. Terrible. One of the girls in the group was taking those absolve. Which is a little white pill that tastes like a niche. haha just like point yeah yeah just like an l toy. yeah so I started taking those and the highest milligrams they come in, is the 5.47 so. is already taking those and I was fine didn't need anymore, you know and then. When I started seeing Dr Pearson and he started prescribing my closet Pam he said that it's dangerous to take the two together, and on top of the fact that I have COPD. My lungs are already screwed up so yes. And that's I guess that's what the problem is, if you take too much some boxing with. A closet Pam I guess it caught, it can cause respiratory problems. Sure, I believe that's the way he explained it to me, so I told him that I would start cutting back on my inbox and which I have done."
527.0,Provider,"You know, and I."
3731.0,Patient,And now i'm going to do it my way slowly. everybody's happy and I don't have to lose my colossal Pam. And they don't have to give up my inbox.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, so is the goal to to to move all the way off of it. And yes, use your. Your clonazepam. Yes, okay."
3731.0,Patient,that's my goal.
527.0,Provider,But the goal is not to try to go into cocaine withdrawal like.
3731.0,Patient,"yeah i'm smoking cigarettes again. And i've got myself down to six, a day. Okay, and it's next week I go down to five a day. The ocala i've done it when I tried to quit before I actually got down to one cigarette a day. Okay, and but a bunch of shit happened some. mice yeah my boyfriend sister who we really loved she was like the Center of the family. She found out she had stage four cancer and she got."
527.0,Provider,wow.
3731.0,Patient,"And I started smoking again. yeah and i've been but he's always on my bed about it. He i'm in every time I light a cigarette he. Signed your smoke and again. All my ass about. It so I started cutting back again. Okay, down to six. yeah that those are my goals you know if I can get off the cigarettes and get off this inbox and completely."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3731.0,Patient,I will be a happy camper.
527.0,Provider,Sure sure.
3731.0,Patient,"But I still, even if I got off this inbox and I still think I want to be in the program because the our sessions, they help."
527.0,Provider,Good okay.
3731.0,Patient,i'm not able to talk anyway and say anything that I want with him.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3731.0,Patient,"he's very, very insecure. Any kind of. criticism you. know but."
527.0,Provider,He just can't.
3731.0,Patient,"handle it. Here it stops and just throws in it's just easier just, not to say anything but unfortunately I keep it all in. Until I talk to you."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
3731.0,Patient,"Then i'm able to vent. i've always been able once I didn't i'm fine. Okay, now it. Definitely it all in all the time. really got me so. Yes, like I said, even if I do get off his inbox and I still think I want to stay into the."
527.0,Provider,Program.
3731.0,Patient,so that I can keep seeing you.
527.0,Provider,"yeah definitely definitely well i'm glad that you know, and I think it's good that you're challenging yourself on on that too, like reducing your medication. Because you know that that's you know that's something you want to move away from and and not have to rely on, but at the same time, we have to you know. Watch, you know the withdrawal symptoms, because that we, we all know, when you have those that just that can start that nasty cycle of a you know falling back into your addiction again just to not."
3731.0,Patient,"Do that I would never do LSD or heroin to replace it it's like if that were the case, I would have done that, when I was withdrawing and when I didn't have."
527.0,Provider,sure.
3731.0,Patient,"You know, but the only reason why I would never do, it is because I don't I in junctions I don't like shocked. I don't like needles at all it's like I have so many shots when I was a kid breaking out in hives and they give me. Yes, drill and put an ids in me and every I was. I felt like a pin cushion from the time I was little until I was a teenager and I. stopped doing it. I grew out of it, for some reason it's like I had them from the time I was like nine and I had them up until I was like 17 and then all of a sudden. Enough they just they just disappeared, but the worst part was I found out is I was allergic to a few things, but the reaction and the breakout I was having was way worse than the small reaction, I was having to the the alert allergy tests, they give you."
527.0,Provider,uh huh huh.
3731.0,Patient,"So it found I found out, it was me I was allergic to myself. Whenever I gotta run out or I got something I would break out in hives."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah."
3731.0,Patient,"And it's like my mother, used to say you're only kid in the world who's allergic to herself."
527.0,Provider,"You know that's funny to me because my mom said the same thing about me, she said, I was like. Two years old, I think, and the neighbors across the street there they had three kids that were a little bit older than my sister night but they it was chicken pox was going around. And she said. She said one day she got me all I don't know where we were going, we were getting dressed to go somewhere and I and apparently I didn't like the outfit my mother put on me, and so I. I must have been like so upset but I broke out in hives because I was so upset and so she ran me over to the neighbors and she's like is this chicken pox you know, does the injury have chickenpox and they're like no and. So it was high when she said. Like she said nope she said from that day forward you dress yourself like I wasn't. So from age. To on she knew I was just. I would just. drive around and determine who's going to dress myself she."
3731.0,Patient,"looked like what. punky brewster. address. Yes, different kind of shoes two different socks yes. Yes, so. All the time when I was a kid."
