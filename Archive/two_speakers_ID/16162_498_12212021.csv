498.0,Provider,Any any thoughts about harming yourself.
16162.0,Patient,"No, not really you know not harming myself, I think. it's so hard to. Compare yourself to others, you know that are doing so well, and here I am struggling with my family background now so and I just think you know. I don't know if it's worth it or not, but it is. You know."
498.0,Provider,It is an opportunity to unpack some of the things some of the weight that you didn't know that you are carrying. Is it can only make the remainder of your walk lighter.
16162.0,Patient,"Gray, I have to remember that and it's not I always i'm very goal oriented So if I if i'm not getting obtaining a goal or accomplishing something right away it's it's. it's hard for me to accept that, but this is not it's a daily journal journey and the things you learn each day about you know your. The damage that was done in your childhood and how to just get rid of that now, and just move on. And that was me that you know, I was abused and all that you know it's just."
498.0,Provider,Nothing yeah kind of tackling your experiences and understanding how it contributed to your overall being and then figuring out ways to manage all of it in the most effective in the most efficient. way yeah. that's.
16162.0,Patient,Quite a journey.
498.0,Provider,"yeah yeah sending lots of lots of lots of favor and light to you on that journey, it can be, it can be a tough journey but it's a good tough journey. yeah yeah um. Do you need a refill on your methylphenidate today."
16162.0,Patient,"Not today, but I will probably in a couple of weeks. You can just put it. on it, if you want, and like."
498.0,Provider,"You know, and that way you already have it. here. Tell me when I think."
16162.0,Patient,"I think I might be using less well I might be sick or now I don't know what this thing you know the process but. I think that. I think that in the future, I probably will be using a lot less than I do now, because I won't need it. i'm hoping. that this will. uncover the reasons why these I keep getting these black clouds coming. troll. You know, taking the one of those tablets."
498.0,Provider,"yeah because that's, the most important part of the work the medication is just a bridge to the other side of the journey. But the work is the real is the real solution. And so, as you do, continue to you know put in the work and kind of explore the origins and been mitigated effectively honestly, you will find that the medication is less and less necessary."
16162.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm hoping that's going to be true, because. All right now. It would be really almost impossible for me to do this if I was depressed all the time because. You just can't do anything and everything is useless and. Everything so. i'm glad I have them available now if I need them to so that I can keep. progressing every day and not keep stepping in and going backwards, every time I get depressed and that step backwards, you know you got to start over again so."
498.0,Provider,yeah absolutely absolutely. I will i'll do your. medication will be. Are you sure are you sure you have enough currently.
16162.0,Patient,"I don't know why do that to myself. I like take half. Okay, just. Take the edge off. yeah but. Because I guess he being dependent on anything. So in that way, I say a lot, but I know some days I should actually take a whole one. And you know I, and I I just can't get that in my head. That they're there for me to use for good reason, and."
498.0,Provider,"I understand your reservations about. medication, but it's not it's not a forever thing. it's very, very. Very temporary. and especially. Especially in your case when you're so. When you're still adamant about doing the work it's it's it's honestly to make the work. easier to pursue and create an environment where you're more receptive to it, so that you can work and be productive during the day in that you do allow yourself to rest at night, and so that you maintain the momentum with regard to the work if it's more difficult internally. You can't receive it will you can't focus your mood is affected by you know the time of year, or you know just the process itself, and then it causes you to refrain from doing the work and then. You kind of back to square one, so it's."
16162.0,Patient,"An outside source, besides my own."
498.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah it's me I can't stress this enough you're in you're in the lowest of low doses. yeah so I mean if it's Okay, if you just can take a half a tablet and still you know be effective, but the 10 milligram is still very, very low, so the low end so. afford yourself the. You know, afford yourself the comfort that it can provide another benefit that it can provide in order to. create some sustained work on the other end in that way you know you look at the other side and say she was right, I don't need this anymore, you know I got that."
16162.0,Patient,"Natural I don't think i'll have to. You know. decide I don't need it anymore, I think you're just."
498.0,Provider,yeah you'll wake up one day and you'll say I don't think i've taken anything i've needed anything in six weeks like what. does happen yeah.
16162.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah it's funny because you know if I broke my leg or something. i've wanted. to purchase and everything. But yeah when it comes up here you can't see it, so it doesn't mean. It means that there's. No."
498.0,Provider,"cadillac but it lacks that tangibility and so we often you know, try to diminish the value of taking care of it in the same way, but it's so important food for thought, there is no cast for the brain, there are no crutches so we have to, we have to make a physical decision to protect it. Right yeah. yeah. I will take care of your refill for you. Because it is do it looks like Sharon called it in previously on November the 11th and likely be the only reason that you still that you still have some supplies because you've been breaking it in half, but I will refill it.
