11741.0,Patient,"yeah cuz you going through a temp agency, but you work full time hours. you're just not like a legitimate you know their employee so once you 90 days that you're their employee you get their their benefits and all that stuff you know vacation days six days stuff like that. Okay."

11741.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"So you're coming up. In 90 days, though right."
11741.0,Patient,"yeah, I think, so I think i've been there over a little over two months Oh, I think it's actually 300 hours. Not 90 days or 300 hours, so you know if I work. 12 hour shifts every day, if I could. I would get there faster than 90 days, obviously, but. we're not getting those kind of hours, right now, so for a couple weeks hours getting 10 hour shifts."
540.0,Provider,And you've been putting like 50 hours and sorry my step daughter ran in the room. yeah she just wanted to get a marker but um how you've been putting in like 50 to 60 hour weeks and right.
11741.0,Patient,"Or, I was getting. I was getting some 50 hour weeks couple weeks ago, but then when it slowed down i've been getting just just under 40. or 40."
540.0,Provider,So you may be able to get those 300 hours a little bit faster than the 90 days.
11741.0,Patient,yeah yeah it's possible it's possible but.
540.0,Provider,"I mean you're almost there too, so. Right now, it goes by fast."
11741.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,So everything's stable how's group and going for you.
11741.0,Patient,Good good yeah was it yesterday actually.
540.0,Provider,"A nice, is there any topics that have been standing out to you or do you guys just kind of like talk about like the updates for the week."
11741.0,Patient,"A little both like yesterday we were talking about boundaries. And then they were they gave us the rundown on like a bunch of the rules and stuff I guess I guess people might have been forgetting the new stuff. Sometimes it's hard, though, when you're new to this thing about like the surveys and stuff like I have my phone's broke, it is my wife's phone right now. So that's why but yeah but I put my email on her phone, so I could check it. But I can see, you know I had a lot of trouble, when I first started with bright heart doing the online stuff and I used to it and get used to it now, though yeah."
540.0,Provider,"yeah and I think like anything it takes a bit to get used to especially technology but we've also been changing things as well in the past few months. So, especially like the system with the compliance so sometimes it takes some time to boot up but, like the surveys, I know that's been a little taxing on people to understand like one."
11741.0,Patient,"Oh, I can't hear you can you hear me."
540.0,Provider,"Can you hear me now. yep okay um yeah it's just getting through like the bump of like the process of change, I think."
11741.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,What do you feel like was like your biggest struggle with with bright heart and like getting started.
11741.0,Patient,"I think At first it was a like the schedules and the timing, because the job I had I would always be at work. And I you know I never knew what the time I was getting off exactly so sometimes I would have to, but now it's now it's where my hours now I mean I, my group is I usually leave it like right to 15 is like the latest I leave to go to work so. My group is at 130 and but at least I still get to talk and everything I have to leave like a couple minutes early but I get through most of the group yeah. But yeah that's about it, though it was just the the timing and get to do everything, but I haven't had that problem anymore, since I got the new hours and everything."
540.0,Provider,"yeah and I think that once people understand that we were very flexible, I mean especially someone on my caseload like I, if I can meet with you and you get something for 15 Minutes that i'm not going to drag it out to be an hour long. But then I just need you guys to show up."
11741.0,Patient,You know i'm saying yeah. yeah. There you go.
540.0,Provider,"um, but a lot of times people don't know that until they show up. So, because it does feel overwhelming when someone starts and it's like Okay, I have to do weekly sessions, and then on top of that, to do the counseling and the survey so feels so taxing but then we're I mean I especially me i'm always gonna be flexible. Just with you guys, but I think that it can be overwhelming to start for sure. yeah yeah. Who runs your group."
11741.0,Patient,Julie Cain which she was actually my doctor before she went to break or I felt her to bring her yeah. Man I. me and my wife bolted.
540.0,Provider,"Oh awesome yeah Julie, I never I never worked with her in a group before, but she she picked up the last two weeks of like one of my providers. So i've been able to be actually working with her."
11741.0,Patient,yeah she's.
540.0,Provider,"yeah she's awesome. yeah she has a lot of like good input and yeah good insight. yeah so you have to start going right your workout you have to leave at 215. yeah okay um do you want to call the virtual clinic to make your appointments for next month. yeah okay. All right, yes, you do that just put that have them put it in for 30 minute sessions, because that's. The minimum that they can do. To do like the 1520 minutes okay. All right, all right alright so i'll see you next month."
11741.0,Patient,"Alright, have a good one."
540.0,Provider,You too. Thanks always.
11741.0,Patient,Like.
540.0,Provider,"All right, for transcription That was my individual session with Lawrence sharp continuing to do shorter sessions so 15 to 30 minute i'm trying to build that rapport. It seems like he opened up a little bit more, so I think that we will be able to build a little bit more and more each time we see each other. don't think there's anything else for me to have to put a notation let me look at his chart really quick. See if there's anything that I need to complete. i'm gonna hang on here and look at his chart. Alright, for transcription I looked at his compliance next time I see Larry i'll talk to him more about the surveys, it says that he needs to complete Bam and the adl survey. which he they usually discuss that in group so group was yesterday, if he did complete it does take several days to go into the computer system. But i'll just plan on talking to him next session. Other than that, nothing else for transcription."
