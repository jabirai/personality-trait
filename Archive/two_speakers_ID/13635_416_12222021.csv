13635.0,Patient,"Good morning, how are you."
416.0,Provider,"darling i'm doing Okay, how are you."
13635.0,Patient,it's early.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13635.0,Patient,i'm off work right now so.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, so this is really early because you. Go ahead. Sorry."
13635.0,Patient,"No, no it's fine. But that's why i'm in my jammies and i'm in bed so."
416.0,Provider,that's perfectly acceptable. Hopefully you go back to sleep back to us.
13635.0,Patient,i'm hoping so yeah that's why no coffee.
416.0,Provider,So. Last. Friday you got stuck in court huh.
13635.0,Patient,"Yes, God I didn't get out of there for. They like my first appointment was at 830 and they had me wait around until 1030 and then told me come back at 11 I came back at 11 and it was five minutes literally five minutes for them, just to say come back in February."
416.0,Provider,You I.
13635.0,Patient,Get so they're like. they're trying to. Consider me for the diversion Program. Which is.
416.0,Provider,Mental version or.
13635.0,Patient,Right right mental health diversion because I used to be an okay citizen. And this all happened in a short period of time and. So yeah hopefully that somehow miraculously works out.
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean it'll it'll look good that you're already in therapy and you know you're already working on a lot of this stuff."
13635.0,Patient,would look better if I just didn't do it.
416.0,Provider,You beating yourself up a lot so.
13635.0,Patient,"yeah i'm having a pretty hard time not it's it's. I did have to have a few hard conversations you know letting people know what what happened. What I did, and all of that which is. it's just. it's just."
416.0,Provider,Who did you talk to.
13635.0,Patient,"The. The person I bought my car from because my X kept my car and everything, so I had to buy a new little you know. get around car and she's a friend of jeans and I had to have that conversation with her. Various family members. You know just people like wondering what what the heck and. I truly for the first However I don't even know how long, but I couldn't. I just really couldn't talk about it, I couldn't I couldn't even. I don't I mean I don't know how to describe it, but it was so awful for me to even admit, let alone talk about out loud. I mean. olivia she's the person I bought the car from and she was you know she's like it was your car and you know, thank God that you're Okay, and you know so on and so forth, but. I just kind of wish that people would be honest with their true thoughts, it would almost like be easier to process like what the Fuck are you thinking you know you're retarded like blah blah blah all that stuff."
416.0,Provider,"It would be doing, people are really thinking."
13635.0,Patient,Probably yeah yeah i'm sure.
416.0,Provider,Many of you think that's what people are really thinking because that's what you're thinking.
13635.0,Patient,"Because it's human nature. And yeah I mean I. I don't know. I definitely think that it was. Just a massive. You know, a massive wake up call like I. I don't know."
416.0,Provider,"So. Okay, just considering. Considering the possibility that's not what people are thinking. Considering the possibility that that's not what people are thinking that. I mean. I think that it's very possible that people are also seeing it as a wake up call. right as like okay so. tie. ties come on through some stuff and. You know, and I and i'm not trying to suggest that you know your decision making, was good, or you know, whatever. But instead of seeing this as like a moral failing, seeing it as like you said a wake up call, seeing it as. A really clear sign that you need more help. Right. Because I know you're beating yourself up over this pretty hard and you're assuming everybody else wants to to. i'm not sure that that's true i'm also very sure that beating yourself up over this rather than seeing it as a very clear sign that you need more than you're getting. is going to make you feel worse. I know you believe you deserve to feel worse right now. that's not going to help you move forward."
13635.0,Patient,True.
416.0,Provider,yeah. I was thinking about you in the Group a lot. I think it's going to be such a good fit for you. There are people in that there are people in that group who are going through similar things.
13635.0,Patient,"Well, God. that's terrible."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah but I bet you don't have that experience, very often huh. I can't even comprehend it all to be honest, I mean I know i've told you before."
13635.0,Patient,I just i'm just. I there's so many pieces missing. So many questions that I have and so much cod so much happening.
416.0,Provider,it's just unbelievable it's.
13635.0,Patient,"seriously unbelievable. And, and every like I just I wish I had some more like. Like I wish somebody would just send me a little. box. Of memories puzzle piece memories, so I can go. plug them in and i'm having such a hard time not understanding. You know what what all took place like I just remember feeling like what like constantly constantly constantly what is going on. And like telling everybody like this is going to kill me this is gonna kill me this is going to kill me like I felt like I was going to die every single day. yeah. And there are people responsible."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13635.0,Patient,And why did everybody go so fucking hard on me like.
416.0,Provider,yeah you feel very targeted.
13635.0,Patient,I was it was insane I mean. like to try to kill me. it's crazy.
416.0,Provider,"I was. This isn't going to help you understand at all. I don't know what well, to be honest. But you and I have talked about em Dr."
13635.0,Patient,yeah looking forward.
416.0,Provider,So they I don't know if it has anyone reached out to you to schedule your.
13635.0,Patient,I scheduled it and then. Just know when I checked it they told me that I need to reschedule it with you because the lady is on vacation. scheduled it for like the 28th.
416.0,Provider,"I can't reschedule it for you, because I don't have her schedule, but."
13635.0,Patient,That I can just go back.
416.0,Provider,Because I asked back to the virtual clinic and get it rescheduled.
13635.0,Patient,"yeah it was like, can I just do it now, and she was like well that's a different clinic, but you can do it with Julie. I was like."
416.0,Provider,she's all. My minutes with me sorry.
13635.0,Patient,"I did a bunch of reading on it, though. And i'm i'm definitely looking forward to it."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13635.0,Patient,"yeah i'm looking I mean anything like and before I talk to you about all this, I was looking into different options like I didn't look into what else spray had. But I was just looking into different. options like I genuinely don't feel like I need like a rehab program or like I genuinely don't feel that I have a bad relationship with alcohol, I really don't I know that alcohol. I know now for sure I mean and I knew, even before I stopped my heavy drinking God it's been nearly a year. I don't have the same relationship with alcohol, but I was like maybe I need to step up my game and do some sort of. treatment, you know or something like that. Even though, deep down, I don't. I don't feel that that's my issue. So anyway, I just it never occurred to me to look into what else. What else you guys had or even to ask for for more help you know, like I that's probably been my biggest downfall this whole year. Is. admitting that I need help."
416.0,Provider,"yeah well when you are a. super self sufficient strong smart woman. yeah well you still are, that person. You just just had a lot of big knocks."
13635.0,Patient,By you is so fucking great man.
416.0,Provider,You still are.
13635.0,Patient,"Literally opened a private homeschool but it's very challenging to do, I had an amazing curriculum, I was starting a fucking charity, I was running my own business, like. I was doing all the things and I was doing it and so well and i'm so happy and so successful."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. hold on tight because you're still that person. You still have all of that in you, nothing has changed about that."
13635.0,Patient,it's been beat oh.
416.0,Provider,"yeah for now. For now. But he nobody can nobody can take that away from you, you still have it there you just don't you don't have it in you to express it right now you've got other stuff it's a maslow's hierarchy of needs thing right you don't have your basic needs met yeah. that's do you are you familiar with maslow. Right, if you think of that pyramid the bottom stuff your stuff is not all in place right now all of that ripped out from under you and when that happens that top level the tip of the pyramid that self actualization it's just not possible, but that doesn't change who you are. And what you're capable of none of that does. It just means that we have to rebuild that bottom part first that's a lot of handling. And a lot of ways, you have. You have a pretty incredible advantage, you know a lot of the folks that I and i'm sure it doesn't feel like that a lot of the folks that I work with. don't know what they're capable of they don't know that they, which in some ways, probably hurts more right because it's such a long way to fall."
13635.0,Patient,"yeah. I feel like I got pushed. Big time. Like in the worst way. Mark to end and everything that happened happened almost publicly. Like I it's just so strange to me to. Like I just feel like I kept going through these situations and seeing that the underbelly of society, the worst the worst of the worst of the worst is is how it felt to me every step of the way every boat like with with the. It doesn't it doesn't matter beating and beating a dead horse."
416.0,Provider,"I don't think it's still not trauma that your brain is working through. You know. Your brain is still trying to just figure out what the hell How did this where what what you know. it's normal the toughest part is that, like you, we've talked about is, you may never know all of the answers. The narrative is not ever probably going to be completely clear."
13635.0,Patient,"It just frustrates me so bad that like throughout this this this healing process I i'm being like I feel like i'm being forced to wear. and bear like a scarlet letter that I didn't earn people, people are taking this mentality of i'm a piece of shit loser who lost her kids and literally every step of this process has been completely. crazy and not according to normal procedure and the fact that CPS got involved in the first place was false allegation against me, I mean it could have been true for Scott. But my oldest daughter's Father said that there was domestic violence in Matthews and that's what prompted a CPS investigation and I had multiple conversations and. on the phone with the CPS worker and. She explained to me on level five you know, this is the highest the highest level of CPS intervention or whatever."
416.0,Provider,level there's no such thing.
13635.0,Patient,"I don't know whatever she and and i'm like. Well, great perfect that's fantastic because that's that's what I need like I we were discussing my youngest daughter. abigail and she had been she was molested in a daycare when she was three years old. And that prompted a lot of behavior over the years that have been very challenging and one of them being her allowing the dogs to. To. play with her private parts. And I we had gotten rid of dogs, we had established behavior issue or boundaries, she was in therapy I I couldn't get Scott, to help me on the topic to save my life I literally could get him. To help me but I told the social worker that that was an issue that I had because it had started again. and To me, I thought it's a. This is a safe place and we're being i'm being honest about what i'm struggling with with her, but it certainly isn't domestic violence or meth use. You know I don't know what to tell you on that, and then Scott turned around and flipped out on me for telling her that issue and i'm like well I don't know Maybe she will help. Maybe she will get me in touch with someone that can help me navigate this situation because you won't like he literally would just shut off and and act like it wasn't an issue and so through the CPS the CPS investigation, the whole time Mike i've told you about my grandpa he's. You know works for the government, and so I was having every email I would send I would have him proofread and take a look at it first make sure that it wasn't too wordy or emotional or whatever. And he kept telling me like that this is not okay like how they're doing this process is not okay. Like every step of the way every time I got arrested every time. You know, an entity or whatever would get involved, I would have him on the phone. explaining to him what was going on, and he kept telling me like tie, this is something is happening, something is going on, this is not how that process works, this is not how that process works. But, yet I could never get anywhere, I can never get anyone to like with CPS I never even met a person in real life, no one ever came into my home, I never spoke to someone face to face never not one fucking time yet on the CPS report, it says ty exudes erratic behavior. How if i'm in the comfort of my own home and i'm acting like a fucking psycho and there are any children there that's my prerogative. Like if, how can you observe me if you've never ever once met me is Scott sending you videos like he sends to everybody else. He was literally recording me constantly and sending clips and footage that's not a that's not an investigation that's not a fair. chance you know, I was spending every single day like I redecorated my house changed everything around kept kept trying to like prepare for this for these people to come into my home to have an opportunity to show that this is a wonderful warm drug free environment. And I never want met a single CPS worker, I never got a single piece of information of paperwork of my rights of anything and I lost my kid like how the Fuck is that how's that even possible."
416.0,Provider,and take you to court at CP oh.
13635.0,Patient,No.
416.0,Provider,So you didn't lose your kids through CPS you lost your kids because Scott.
13635.0,Patient,"I get I literally don't even know like I don't even know, to this day, like i'm assuming because of both both the the they both went to family law."
416.0,Provider,"And yes, doesn't do family law."
13635.0,Patient,"No, no reuben reuben and Scott both yeah they both went to family law and said oh look CPS got involved did ties insane and that i'm assuming that's how I lost them, but like through the CPS process like I did CP. Like every every single thing was so fucking premeditated and plant."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13635.0,Patient,"And I kept trying like I just was fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting and I had to have a conversation with my grandpa though it was terrible. My mom and I went to Monterey over the weekend and I haven't spoken to my grandparents since like April. My grandpa is very easy very important man. And through this process, he had a stroke and he almost died. And my grandma blamed me she was like ty he can handle this like he kid."
416.0,Provider,that's not your fault.
13635.0,Patient,"And so I haven't talked to them, you know, since, which has been really hard, because my grandpa is. he's very smart and he's he is aware of like how to navigate stuff it. I mean, he was through he went through. So much with me, you know someone I told you, someone had reported me as a terrorist it went to jail and I built myself out then Scott reported fraud, and then I went back to jail. On my birthday. And that you know he got he helped me through that he helped me he helped me through. So many. different situations. But every step of the way he kept telling me. This isn't right, something is wrong, this is it right, and I was like i've been trying to forget tell you i've been trying to like I don't know what to do, I can only do so much, I was completely by myself fighting what felt like the whole city local fucking world. and try to live every single day with people tried to hurt the every single fucking day. And so, anyway, my mom called him over on the way to Monterey. And it was terrible it was terrible terrible conversation I was. I was, I was upset I basically took on the mentality of if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all, because they. I I under I understand who they are, and I understand the choice that that they're making but."
416.0,Provider,When you say you mean your grandparents.
13635.0,Patient,"my grandparents because they got on the phone and they're just like Oh, you know just continue to grow and continue to heal and we love you more than anything, and we love me more than anything. And i'm like yeah but. Actions speak louder than words and I don't understand. Like. they're like there is no I feel like there is unconditional love is simply not a reality, you know i'm like my grandparents knowing all that I went through they were right there they were in the thick of it, you know they were right there. Not many people could keep up throughout throughout the process and how could you possibly. turn your back on me. Like how could you possibly. It just was a shitty it was just overall just super shitty. For me i'm sure it was fine for them, I didn't make them I didn't they didn't know that I was. Anything but it was just not a conversation that I wanted to have with my mom President driver, you know. yeah my grandparents are tough people to talk to in general."
416.0,Provider,In a way.
13635.0,Patient,i'm.
416.0,Provider,Just because there is so emotionally laden for you.
13635.0,Patient,"Very there, I mean my grandpa is I can't even comprehend what all he's just a very he's he's military he's military he's he's government he's a Council he's. Just uber uber uber driven and successful and we've always been able to connect in that way, and my grandmother's entire existence is my grandfather. She has and I understand that, but. It just was there just a tough group, like I can't say I can't even say damn you know, like there's no cussing there's no. You know there's no accountability whatsoever like. anytime we try to. discuss like because my mom and I haven't always had a good relationship so. You know tumultuous relationship shitty childhood all of that stuff and we we start talking about. That stuff and I tried to explain to my grandparents like you guys have always lived on the east coast you weren't around you have no idea what kind of a childhood, we had you have no idea what you're asking me. To to do with my mother like if I want to have the conversation we can have the real conversation about about it, or we can just not go there. at all, you know what I mean and it's just that we just start cellular Lee we're cellular Lee different and i'm it's hard for me to stay and then the little box that they. That they want you to be in very proper very. politically correct very all of those things. And I think that I love them I adore them they're amazing people. It just it just feels awful to. to know that I affected him so much to go."
416.0,Provider,Did you though. You are not responsible for his stroke.
13635.0,Patient,"I I don't believe that I was, I mean it they kept it from me to like they didn't even tell me right away. And I was like if you guys would have fucking told me that I was causing him to have heart palpitations or you know don't answer your phone or tell me hey grandpa is not feeling well right now, you know, like but certainly. it's it should have gone down the way that it did."
416.0,Provider,"No, and you are responsible for his stroke, I mean it's that's absurd thing to say. And I even asked my stroke."
13635.0,Patient,"railed during all this stuff he he was observing the the the course of events, how they took place, I called him because you because I knew the frickin lines are recorded. And i'm like I told him everything the ins and outs of each thing that occurred, and I was like it would be helpful if grandpa would just either write me out an email or or have a conversation with me, so I can cliff notes. So stuff. You know, like he was the one person that I genuinely put. Like I leaned on him huge because there I didn't know what else to do. And she was like his heart, you know or his health is just you know he can't he can't do that there's no way he's going to be doing that grumble suck and let him do that. And I told her, I was like I don't understand what makes his life more important than everybody else's I really don't I don't understand it, I don't know why i'm expendable like when did that happen when did my life become like. She lives or dies whatever. You know, like what the Fuck. You guys were all happy to to. To be around to take and enjoy and all of that every I mean and then. pint glass house falls, as my mother said. And that's it nobody's here nobody's around. it's just insane to me."
416.0,Provider,Not the people who should be. Right yeah.
13635.0,Patient,"Anyway, i'm sorry."
416.0,Provider,"Sorry that's what this is for there are. There are people around still. Right. They just aren't the people you expect it to be, and hope to be."
13635.0,Patient,I mean the amount of loss is just insane.
416.0,Provider,"staggering it's staggering yeah yeah i'm not trying to dismiss that. Last grief trauma is you had. Six lifetime's worth in the span of a year, two years."
13635.0,Patient,I had that lot like in the span of probably baby days. yeah it happened so fucking.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah. it's it's inconceivable. thing we have to be careful about. Is the narrative we attached to it. yeah because there is so much that's unknown that's unconfirmed or that. narratives are really important. Right in terms of like, how do we in terms of how we move forward right being able to talk about what happened in a way, the way we talk about things as we think about things, and the way we think about things is the way, is what allows us to move forward and heal. Right and i'm not saying you're doing anything wrong."
13635.0,Patient,Oh i'm listening.
416.0,Provider,"i'm just saying. That this is an opportunity to create a narrative that helps you move forward right, we have to be really careful about how we how we create that narrative right. Because there are so many different ways to understand and interpret what's going on, and because we will never know the exact well, I mean hopefully we will. But it's likely and it's very possible that we will never know the exact facts, so our narrative is going to be built on your interpretation of the situation. Right right, so a lot of like narrative around. Around beating yourself up or you know not being worthy of love or anything like that we just have to be careful because that's going to really hold you back it's going to stick. Because you are. Very loved. I think that in this case. you're born into a family that has a lot of limitations. Right your mom has her own limitations which you've been aware of, since you were really little. and your grandparents, it sounds like well, they have a lot of love for you. They have I mean you described it perfectly. But they have their own really strong limitations. So."
13635.0,Patient,I agree.
416.0,Provider,"The lack of love, I hear it as. they're simply not capable. of seeing beyond their own little tiny worldview."
13635.0,Patient,"I think. It would be next to impossible for anybody to comprehend. Because it's just so much easier to take the stereotypical narrative. That is is your standard in that in that just simply doesn't apply here. It just doesn't there's no one's ever going to understand it, because i'm never going to understand it, but I know damn good at well, but this. This was. Something inhumane. This was, and I, and I, I guess, I just keep fearing like why you know I just keep hearing. What could possibly have been so bad for people to harm so heavily. Especially but. I mean you know. there's i've tried so much over the past months, like try like maybe I maybe I did just lose it may maybe. Maybe I did just just lose my mind like you said a bro breaking reality. Maybe he was trying, he was enduring all this and and i'm like no fucking way like there's no fucking way like like there's. there's so there's so many times, where i'm just like like I stared at him I screamed at him like what what is going on. So. feeling like I was in someone else's. World feeling, you know, like something like a something changed and and everyone got the script but me is how it felt. every step of the way literally every step of the way was so fucking calculated. from taking everything from throwing me in a fucking mental institution from throwing me into a halfway house, but, but all of the events like they made sure to to. To set it up just perfectly and to, and what I would I would literally asked him like what Why do I feel this way what what. I feel like i'm gonna die oh you're fine you're fine you're fine you're fine and then he would scream at me, you need to get help you need to get help you need to get help you're fine you need to get help you're fine you need to get hope of like hope for what would. Please explain it to me, but he wouldn't there wasn't like I think you're on drugs, you need to get help I think you're an alcoholic you need to get help. I think you're losing your mind, do you need to get help it was just constantly you need to get help you need to get help and you're fine over and over. and over again, and I can't I am having such a hard time thinking like it's money driven. and And i'm that's probably exactly what it is it's probably exactly what it is, because he kept saying over and over you have no idea what we have to lose you have no idea what we have to lose will then tell me. Tell me, what we have to lose because, as far as i'm concerned ruben just got custody of Madeline and reuben has a fucking pedophile so I just lost half my heart. It nothing else matters money doesn't matter the fact, none of this shit matters like he's a goddamn pedophile and he somehow managed to get fucking custody of a team of my teenage daughter. Nothing else could possibly matter, but at the same time, I was working on on selling his his grandpa's home that he was a third inheritance to."
416.0,Provider,scotts or ruben.
13635.0,Patient,"And I through that process, I found out that his aunt had done all kinds of fraudulent things with his grandfather's money and with the taxes and all of this stuff on this property, so it was a million dollar home. and I worked my ass off to get this House ready to go marketed properly or even hired a Co listing agent to help take some of the heat and. I felt like I failed all this shit that Tamar had done over the years and I found an attorney for Scott to. To hold her accountable because, mind you, he had inherited money from his ground but from his dad as well that she was the executor for associate so there was a whole mountain of evidence against her and she is a corporate tax accountant does like Google taxes. And we hired an attorney. I had to back out of the whole escrow. and That, I think, also it's hurting did at this point was to write a letter to her like basically demanding X, Y and Z. and I think that that probably put the fear of God into tamra and there is no other. Children and she has all kinds of money, and so I. Was freaking out that he was going to lose inheritance from her to. or. Or what like I. But what she was doing was freaking terrible like she it was absolutely awful and she had mismanaged like half a million dollars. And then Witten and it became the new buyers responsibility to pay all these taxes from her falsely. Handling everything, so I don't like that that was such a small little blip during everything you know, but like thinking back on it i'm like was that a big motivation for him, like losing losing inheritance at the hands of time because ties trying to hold her accountable, I have no idea. Like is that a real reason to throw away 13 years and and try to kill someone literally."
416.0,Provider,There probably isn't just one reason right there probably is there's probably a build up you I mean you've mentioned a lot of different ideas that you have around this.
13635.0,Patient,"A lot money gay sex addicted all kinds there's all kinds of options. But it's none of it to me is justifiable none of it makes none of it is acceptable, none of it is and. I don't know it's to me it's so it's sociopathic. Like it's I feel like I got shirt like they struck me out for the world to see like. Just. it's so fucking frustrating and it's. it's so hard to let go it's so hard to move on."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13635.0,Patient,Sorry.
416.0,Provider,My.
13635.0,Patient,"Because I just have I feel like I have so. I need to focus on the other, I need to figure out. A way to. get out of this like victimized role to stop overanalyzing to. I just i'm struggling so bad with there's I I, I feel, like all the blood is on my face. My head is not fucking right."
416.0,Provider,"Well, that can definitely be part of the narrative. I mean it is part of the narrative frame is like. Whatever happened. And we have lots of ideas and it could have been all of them are none of them are something totally different. Whatever happened it's not it was not okay it's not okay it'll never be okay. And you suffered as a result you. are still suffering as a result."
13635.0,Patient,This is going to change the course of my children's lives forever. forever. it's good to alter who they are.
