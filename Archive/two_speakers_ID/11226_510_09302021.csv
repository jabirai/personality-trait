510.0,Provider,"behind the scenes. yeah no I get it, there is a lot of that that. gorgeous photo so when you go to these shows are there, particular photographers that sort of set up shop they take photos and then that's how they kind of make some money and they sell them to the participants."
11226.0,Patient,"There are there's like you know you some of them actually ride, in the event so there's usually a couple that are there and then they just set up and then you can buy like the weekend, or you can just buy like a couple of shots in a very expensive than like."

510.0,Provider,"Oh nice I am I lately, I have just been getting more and more introduction to horses so where I live, now there are farms and there's. A family they rescued a horse. And we have bought some horse cookies and we're going to go visit this horse to feed and i'm so excited I immediately always think of you."
11226.0,Patient,"Because I was running my patient who I mean you are an expert on horses, so I was like."
510.0,Provider,yeah so i'm going to feed this horse some some horse vicki's yeah I guess it was in pretty bad shape so they're hoping.
11226.0,Patient,That she'll.
510.0,Provider,"still make it yeah I it's yeah I don't know much about horses, but you probably would know a lot more, we talked about that last time, like. yeah well, I think I told you that I was gonna say yeah."
11226.0,Patient,"Mine so when it's mine strangers tendon. Like right on the left and then the third time it was like a slight stream so. Did I can't remember if I told you, it went out on loan it went out on lease."
510.0,Provider,uh huh.
11226.0,Patient,"it's Nice that. Internet freaked out. yeah so I put the whole song, and I think was it Monday. mm hmm anyway, she sold yesterday and they came out they came out to see her Laughter said we're going to do a vet check and I was like. yeah and I was i've been very honest even on the advert you know, like this you're attending that she needs to do for a job, like. So I said okay well that's cool you know cool the vet out, but she may not, you know pass the flesh and test deflection tested swimming pool the for the way up and then. Job them and sometimes they can take like a couple of steps. And little funky, but a lot of horses are like that even you know, like an old horse, I mean if someone can't your leg up yeah and held it for you to run off up straight."
510.0,Provider,yeah.
11226.0,Patient,"Which is perfectly fine if you're going to do in life is draw down the beach right so. you're not going to the Olympics, so I did try to explain that to the other people, but they were like so freaked out. And then, of course, you know where you split where you were the tendon breaks. It has a likelihood of tearing above or below where it was because those miners have joined together and so there's always that risk but. yeah anyway, the vet came out and, of course, on reflection, test she just did like maybe one or two steps, but she's completely sounds regardless, and I said i'm totally open to drug testing, they want to drag her you know test her for drugs to make sure that I didn't have one so. So anyway, they came out yesterday. That was out and so she was like Oh, you know so he bought it a little bit, but then she sold so i'm sure the other trainer when they see that she sold and vecher bad checks and for those she's been you know, like. What that goddamn horse so, but now so i've got another one to sell and then we look for another one for my daughter so that's kind of."
510.0,Provider,exciting yeah. You have a lot of integrity I. We talked about that you have a lot of integrity selling these animals and.
11226.0,Patient,I yeah she said that she really liked the idea that she felt that. You know everything was very honest and.
510.0,Provider,yeah exactly and you said there's some shady mcgrady's that aren't as honest and don't.
11226.0,Patient,have lots of them. yeah way too many of them. So yeah I think people are a little bit short. Like everyone's always looking for the scam you know just like weather is it was.
510.0,Provider,yeah. yeah yeah.
11226.0,Patient,"So that's good. yeah dog down this week, so that was a bit sides. kind of timeframe to go."
510.0,Provider,"yeah oh goodness it's never long enough, they don't live long enough. they're deciding. How are you holding up how's the family holding up."
11226.0,Patient,"kids cut a ticket well we've been sort of waiting expressing it for a long time he sort of he was really then. You know we've done a lot of tests, I think they're really figured out, we never really figured out what was wrong with him, so he wasn't really eating and and then and then he just was always sort of like whining and pain and he's sort of lost like. You know he's always. yeah last like that, so I you know, so this week us is sort them so. My husband took him and put him down, so I didn't know that you've been I guess there's some miscommunication about. He said I think i'm going to take him in today I didn't hear it my other kids didn't hear it, and then hazel head, so he said she said goodbye. And I think my other daughter say goodbye, but I didn't hear it, so I was like really confused when I came back when my husband was crying I was like what."
510.0,Provider,"Oh yeah oh that's sort of a big deal like do you feel like you didn't really I know you knew he probably was ready to go, but still just sort of having that moment to say goodbye in your way, how are you holding up with that that sort of a big deal."
11226.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm not trying to make anyone feel bad. I don't know and, for me, I felt that it went on a bit too long. Keeping him alive yeah yeah sorry. I did I and and you know sort of interesting that we talked about that say I mean I mean you know i'm happy. know how happy that he's gone, but I feel relieved that he's gone as a little bit."
510.0,Provider,Like.
11226.0,Patient,"My mom bites like there's a relief that they've. gone. But I think that, since i've been doing all this meditation and it was something that someone else had spoken about with that I really live in the present moment."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11226.0,Patient,"And so, when people die or when dogs type of thing, so no longer in your life anymore people whatever like that sadness comes from remembering. Like those happy past memories more wishing that you had more of your or what you like people thinking about like you know if I was with this guy or whatever, then I you know we were we were going to have kids or whatever the hell their fantasy."
510.0,Provider,futures mm hmm.
11226.0,Patient,"But I don't really have that, so I, I am not a sad to say, my husband he's wandering around looking at the empty basket every two minutes."
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah. I think.
11226.0,Patient,"I think there's a part of me that thinks that I don't care, but it's not that they don't care, it says the name not taking myself there and it's not that i'm Disconnecting someone was talked about this on like one of the job Spencer things that they're talking about how his wife died."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11226.0,Patient,"But because you're able to connect through meditation like i've connected through my dog. Through meditation and for like you're connected and and to be thankful and grateful for all of these things so it's, not that I don't. have that. But i'm not like wandering around morning like I feel like I don't feel guilty because that's just how I feel, but I think that my husband feels like that i'm a little. Non emotional maybe."
510.0,Provider,"yeah and it can kind of look that way but you're what you're doing is you're really embracing the present moment and so you're not you're not caught in the past right and you. can be in the present moment and have those. Memories of the dog or person, this is exactly what happens and you're not you know sad or getting caught up in the future of what could have been you're just appreciating and staying in this moment. And that that has talked about a lot Eckert totally talks about that to around death that it's not a disconnect you're just you're accepting this moment, as it is and it's a loss, but it doesn't mean you don't care absolutely that there's."
11226.0,Patient,Really healthy what someone else is looking in. That doesn't have that. Precise so they're they're gonna be like oh.
510.0,Provider,"She just doesn't know I know what you're talking about I know and if, and if your husband, maybe just to sing and to that because a lot of those thinkers talk about that, because when you resist the present moment and you're not accepting it that's when suffering truly happens. And we can still acknowledge Oh, my goodness, this last is you know sad and you can name it right, but the suffering really comes in, when we resist. what's really happening, and that is the loss so yeah it's tough it's a different and it's also sort of a different mindset, not everybody practices mindfulness and and it sounds like."
11226.0,Patient,It is. And that's where it is or bringing up some other sort struggles to is that now it's like i've worked so hard with my own inner chatter.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11226.0,Patient,"it's a little frustrating to hear someone else's inner chatter. Like not only have I controlling my inner chatter and I got to hear your constant inner chatter. mm hmm and. it's, not that I don't want to give him his time is glancing at the top, but or whatever every two minutes and. annoying."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11226.0,Patient,"And I try not to, because then they'd like everybody processes everything different but. it's not just not just like one example say went out for drinks, with a friend of mine and. I think this this is when you start to realize how much you've changed like when you've done you start to do the work but. Even sat there listening and I was being really present and that was what I saw when they're with us like only to be really pretty and I know she's gone for a lot of drivers from food to boss, and our kids all acting up and our kids are miserable and. You know, like, I know I know it's just not good, and a job and single mom and things like just crap like I know that she's going through all of that, but. it's really difficult to sit there to like listen to. Like. Talk about other people's relationships and talk about just the stuff that is say I just don't think about this stuff. it's really I feel I mean I think part of this is like maybe I need to surround myself with like minded people cuz I have nothing to say anymore I just they get involved with that."
510.0,Provider,"i'm yeah and that sometimes happens when you start making those shifts within your own internal your energy is shifting your your mindfulness is shifting your. ability to hold space for others, is there, but the reality is sometimes we then have to let go of things that are no longer sort of serving that purpose right and it's not a bad thing again nothing lasts for."
11226.0,Patient,"me try and save them, you know you could completely change your wife your life you don't have to be a victim of like curiosity. And then they just like you, like you, that."
510.0,Provider,"Well, and you have to it well and you're not there right you're not they're not."
11226.0,Patient,"righteous and I can only suggest, and then you like just. That I just got off the topic, I gave my speech in, and I was like. God, I was like."
510.0,Provider,"Now yeah you will you can you're only responsible for you, you start with you now others might gravitate towards you and be like hey let's honor up to she's really got it going on. I can't have that. yeah and that's how you attract, but there are many people in this life, they will live and die, and they will be unconscious, and that is just that is just how it is and that's okay there's no judgment if they're ready to kind of make some of those changes it comes from them. Right yeah you might. You might be sorting through or weeding through some of the things that might no longer serve you and that could be some friendships that you're like. You know, it was helpful, it was good, but. Maybe maybe that will shift you'll you will sit with that right, and you will reflect and you will have or have a response versus a reaction so. I don't know."
11226.0,Patient,"it's, like the other side of that it's like when you say connects into that and you say happy and grateful, the time you actually don't need anyone anyway it's like it's very strange you'd like I mean you need people but you're so connected that. That you don't really no longer need anything from anyone else, or anything so it's a very strange."
510.0,Provider,And while you're already sort of carrying this I have within me everything I am already full right so.
11226.0,Patient,All right.
510.0,Provider,"People walk around feeling they don't have enough, you know, and so you are really also it sounds like practicing your gratitude you you walk with a sense of abundance already so you're not out searching to fill yourself up you already like. I have what I need yeah that says a lot that you continue to do the work. Of course. Of course, though."
11226.0,Patient,"So you know I did get I did, which has been like really good like better than anything else i've got so far so got that the G, have you been on to Gaia."
510.0,Provider,Gaia is.
11226.0,Patient,She a I a. it's amazing it's really amazing.
510.0,Provider,Guy yeah.
11226.0,Patient,"Okay, you need to pay for it it's like 10 bucks a month for you get the first seven days free."
510.0,Provider,Okay.
11226.0,Patient,"And it's all about consciousness is everything is everything it has like the whole Joe dispenser like a whole series on him has whole series on like meditations for you guys, it has. everything to do with a setup there's a whole series about really finding out who you want to be in what you want to do in life, like it's all positive I mean a job, like some ufo stuff on there, but it's all to do with. Money mindfulness like the whole, the whole thing, like the best thing ever."
510.0,Provider,i've been admitted is. i'm trying to Google it just so I meditations of Gaia i'm not seeing like a.
11226.0,Patient,"Like a serious like a. series if you put like. Like Joe dispenser I might have spelled it wrong she a I and then you can like look it up on tru TV. it's only two. Maybe is, you have to pay for it, so I could pay prescription, you might be able to watch a couple of things for free, but all of like the."
510.0,Provider,"Like the hell not seeing it okay i'll try to maybe yeah I might not be selling it right either, but i'll i'll look it up i'll make a note it's, at least with a g. yeah okay."
11226.0,Patient,"I can send it over to um I don't know how to do i'll probably lose you, if I touch anything. But yes very good super positive. And it has all these different like series on it and I can't remember the guy sounds like so I never know who this guy was, and I know you're gonna need you pull you might know who it is, but it sounds like an Indian name but it's like some Ram DASS you know he rammed."
510.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah yeah oh.
11226.0,Patient,"Why. Ram DASS was like some Indian guy anyway, so I listened to all the time and then they have a whole thing on like Ram DASS and. He was pretty interesting the teachings of Ram DASS they've got so many different series on there they're like really good. So anyway, I fill my life with that at the moment that's kind of a good one, sometimes you. can send you into like all kinds of crazy stuff, so this is like a paid very sort of focused and what I really loved was I can't remember which one I was watching, but it was talking about all these different religions and how you know religions Gray. And they're all pointing to the same thing, which is like consciousness. But because you're like in this physical reality we like turned into like we will have our own like matter here and we've missed the point and it was all pointing us the right direction, but how we've all got lost but it's really good like. The right now i'm watching a thing called missing links and it's talking about a you know our Einstein and how now they figured out about how consciousness, this should be such a pop science and it's like a proven fact and it's really good it's really good."
510.0,Provider,yeah exactly I think you have found a passion. yeah and it really resonates i'm so happy for you.
11226.0,Patient,"The new women's into this and doesn't think i'm some sort of weird I. wonder. So that's The other thing too, I was just thinking you know, like what you're sort of interest you know i'm talking about, but you know, maybe this next women's not going to be like that one and then."
510.0,Provider,"we'll have to check in with her, I know, because when I was trained on mindfulness meditation that's where it opened the door for me to some of the other spiritual teachers and yeah I, so I incorporate it and a lot of my work so but approach it. Put the feelers out, I hope, so I don't know, though I mean obviously you met her when I met her so she has a dog, which I love."
11226.0,Patient,"I guess the beginning. Yes, I didn't know now, I understand, like this and how you can change your brain from like all of the suffering it's really hard for me to for conventional talk therapy. When you can go in and you can reprogram stuff like."
510.0,Provider,"Well, but a lot of the cvt talks about that, with the the thoughts, we have informs emotions and then and impacts behavior but then, if you put the layer of mindfulness and consciousness raising to me it's just it's it's That is exactly how I like to approach therapy, but. Right get it a lot of this can be done outside of talk therapy which you're doing you're sort of like a perfect example I mean your podcasts your videos that you do is almost your own therapy. Because it really resonates and i'm just i've been lucky and honored that no pun intended to be able to kind of be able to reflect back and like absolutely because I do share a lot of those thoughts for how I approach so but yeah I think it's I think we've been a good fit I. really enjoyed working with. You."
11226.0,Patient,"We shouldn't you know. yeah it's funny yeah it's so it's so funny how like. You go into one thing and it totally took me running I mean I kind of believe a lot of this anyway, but now it's just like a whole nother level of processing like even this morning out my friends, you know show them. How many gods since i've known her she's been on more diets and she's always say miserable. Like. Last if this doesn't work you're gonna have to like. go into the mind and really like figure it out like fine and she's finally like. figuring it out, I think, was today, you know she talked to her sister, and she was having some anxiety and. I said well you know, like if you're having anxiety for you're not in the present moment she's always telling me about how. You know if you're like getting a car she's in a car, she goes inside she buys like a cream cake he goes back to the car she eats the green place and I said, you know. we're in that moment of when you sit in your car there's a lot of times in your car going in the store and getting back you should really try and like take a step back and just listen like what your brain is telling you if you can you know, like. Like what is it telling you because i'm telling you exactly so I deserve it i've been on it."
510.0,Provider,"But, and what happens is they get really over identified. Right happy miss thought I am over identifying it, it must be true going for, and these are all very. condensed patterns thinking and so to open the mind, no, there is a different possibility out there that's scary but. that's what you're sort of communicating to her, there is a possibility to do it differently, but it is scary it's scary for people to let go of those. patterns and behaviors. yeah so it's it's I think it's great i've really enjoyed being able to to talk in depth with these sorts of things because yeah I. I ran into my therapy and you certainly aren't going right. I love it I love it. Well, I wish you the best. Likewise, I know you're going to be on your horse and doing awesome things so Keep up the good work it's really been a privilege."
11226.0,Patient,"to enjoy your country life. And Dawson i'll send you that link you're going to love it. as well. yeah at least. Seven three days and see if it's something for you. yeah I gotta love it yeah send it to me so all right all right. Well, thank you."
510.0,Provider,enjoy welcome bye. that's done with honor Leslie and since over zoom room is closed.
