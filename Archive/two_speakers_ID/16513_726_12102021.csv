726.0,Provider,hi.
16513.0,Patient,"hi i'm so sorry I got the the date and the time mixed up, so I was thinking is it 10."
726.0,Provider,Oh it's okay.
16513.0,Patient,To be honest and super achy I got a Cobra booster yesterday.
726.0,Provider,And I go to.
16513.0,Patient,A different brand of the shot and my body seems to be having more of a reaction to this one. So i'm hanging in there. Happy happy for this appointment.
726.0,Provider,Tell me a little bit about. About yourself and what you were we were hoping to get out of. doing some work here.
16513.0,Patient,"Well, I. had denied having much of a trauma history up until last September, when I entered residential treatment and. got diagnosed with ptsd ptsd and specified because it's like I guess it'd be complex trauma because I don't have a lot of explicit memories of of some of it. But i've got like developmental primary and secondary trauma. And i've been working. When I was in residential and then, when I transitioned into a php iot program I was lucky to be able to was my first like encounter with cmdr. And with somatic based. trauma therapies, so I also got to do some magic experiencing. And I got a lot out of it, I have. Like I have some treatment providers i'm currently working with right back at the beginning of October. The amount of of support, I was able to get dramatically changed because I lost my Cobra insurance, and it was only on medicaid. And so, and I haven't worked in over a year and mostly living off of savings and so that's kind of dwindling so basically and like I was looking for an emt or person over the course of this past year it's just been really hard to find someone who. Had availability and took my insurance. So i've been doing the the trauma person who i've worked with remotely i'm still you know, working with but like on them to a much smaller degree. that she does primarily gee I am like guided imagery with music which i've gotten a lot out of. Her schedule can be kind of erratic she's in the National Guard so it'll be like oh i'm traveling traveling to the next month or whatever. And yeah I did a lot of intensive work with her over the summer, but she did also encourage me if I could to find somebody to cmdr just to have a different approach. And with the. Loss of the private insurance and having to scale back on the number of sessions, I was doing per week. i've definitely noticed in D compensation in my soul so it's like I feel like i've got a lot of the kind of the turmoil from Traumas from trauma work that i've done. And i'm looking for for channels that I can. Make use of to check to to get it to move and like process it and you know. Both be productive but also. Bring maybe relief."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. Tell me a little bit about treatment, so you were a treatment for what before that loves you."
16513.0,Patient,"Oh i'm so I mean I have. A couple of diagnoses the generalized anxiety disorder one I debate because, frankly, I think that it's that the symptoms that they asked for actually just symptoms for trauma."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
16513.0,Patient,"yeah like. it's the god now I think it's kind of ridiculous because it's like. it's trauma and depression, a lot of our lot of the same symptoms so, but my other diagnosis, it was changed from. Major depressive disorder recurrent severe without psychotic features to persistent depressive disorder, with major depressive episodes recurrent severe without psychotic features. And then ptsd and specified. Whether or not I get an added generalized anxiety went on there. Can I depends on the provider, but. The two people i've worked with you know. Scott, the primary therapist whoever different you know four years or so, four and a half. I wouldn't say that I have generalized anxiety disorder, because I don't. i'm not typically worried about being worried."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I think you are right, because a lot of the arms these diagnoses, they can very much overlap and so it's hard to like sift through all of the symptoms, because sometimes they they can very much overlap with each other so that doesn't make sense. Especially if you got the ptsd diagnosis that the anxiety, the depression are can go hand in hand with them with ptsd."
16513.0,Patient,yeah and I. mean when I got the ptsd diagnosis and started doing trauma specific care like body based stuff you know and an emt er in particular. I kind of. felt so like. A pull back the curtain on on years of working on depression and I have to wonder if I haven't been barking up the wrong tree. I only trying to treat depression and that could speak to why I have been benefited like I i've done a lot of forms of treatment and they don't typically touch my mood or outlook and. mtr like somatic experiencing and shannon's guided imagery stuff it feels like it's. Like i'm working with a language that resonates.
726.0,Provider,yeah. Tell me a little bit about what are some of the things that he felt like you have been contemplating in some way to have a few refreshing so Charlie just tell me a little bit about that.
16513.0,Patient,"Well i'm listening to an audiobook i'm trying to get through it anyway in little bits and pieces on complex trauma and it's called complex Traumas from surviving to thriving. And it sounds like from what the author says i'm going through something he calls. an emotional flashback. But it's been now i'm on like week eight maybe it's like yeah I can last for weeks, but it's like being more. Probably more easily triggered and and dissociative. More. A reactive internally more anger coming to the surface emotionally they. I find disturbing because. I feel like I need to protect people from from my anger. I had a friend come to visit and well oh God like when I was pet sitting recently as pet sitting for this cat for a month. And I was getting triggered by the cat. I ended up seeking safety on the floor of a bathroom in the House. As it was. Smaller warm and dark and. No more I have had some weird dreams and perhaps the first flashback of some childhood sexual trauma. It can. be harder to focus and to be organized and to just think. and"
726.0,Provider,"So it's not quite gotten. From the beginning, when we started, you were talking about i'm pre verbal. Okay."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah yeah there's definitely childhood stuff. Coming from a pretty. narcissistically oriented and substance abusing dysfunctional family were. No finally starting to allow myself to accept that I, I really don't think my mom ever really wanted children like she wanted us, but she doesn't. You know. it's just so lot of neglect and. For me, physical abuse from my brother. You know, and just a lot of chaos at home. Although we were. You know, although I was raised in an upper middle class family. My parents thought a lot about money, they still do. And so that that was it. As questionnaire."
726.0,Provider,"Oh yes, yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"I wasn't sure what to put on that well, I mean part of it, because of the often very often they would often they offer fight about money and. And it's kind of hard, because as a kid it's like I look around a nice things seem like they're stable, but the message i'm hearing is that everything can fall apart. And then there's also the part in that item about medical stuff, and this was an often right. yeah there, there was medical neglect growing up like high school I fractured my sacred my parents when they see a doctor for six months. Why. The muscles healed in correctly, I still have problems with it. And then I mean then there's like other stuff, but this is past the age of 18 we're like I have celiac disease and just as an example, my dad put gluten in my food intentionally for a year. To. prove to me I guess that I didn't have this condition or it wasn't bad so lots of. shaming not mission section. Not not a close knit group. And I was there was long suspected childhood, sexual abuse, like my sister was a survivor as well. And it wasn't until. A few months ago that. I finally had started to have some somatic memories. Which share."
726.0,Provider,So. carolyn um. It sounds like you've done a lot of somatic work. Some of these memories. Come more polite after two or more somatic work.
16513.0,Patient,"It came to light when I was doing the guided imagery stuff and i'm using the term I guess somatic loosely. In the there's no. Touching or anything shannon's a provider who I only worked with remotely. and yeah this stuff came to life. Actually, in. A big thing that brought it up was. A friend of mine who was visiting. And that's been it a huge trigger. So one of my best friends his name is Tom and. We have been very good friends for a decade but. We haven't lived in the same state really lived in the same state for two weeks and that's when we first met and we had tried, you know to. Have a closer, more intimate relationship once a few years ago and I wasn't feeling it and. He came out to visit. Well it's at the end of August to mid September. And that triple and well, but it was after he left is when the memory started coming up. and it's also when I went from having a lot of support from treatment providers to a fraction. And i'd asked him to actually come out come back out to Seattle. Because we could go stay at my parents condo while they traveled abroad. And he did, and it just. It did not go well for me internally. I feel. Like a bad person. admitting that. we're Tom but also when was sounds ridiculous this cat that was caring for. It feels like it's triggering times, both the sexual trauma, but also the attachment trauma. and i've been wondering if. i've been feeling toward them in some ways, like how my mom felt toward us kids and like how her mother felt toward her kids. Because. my grandmother. Was. This, for the first child shouldn't you kids impregnated against her consent. Actually didn't want to be a mom. and So yeah it's. You know just feeling more and more of a need to. isolate and just push people away cuz I don't want to have to respond to what they need or want for me. When Tom was in town. My inability to predict or control like when he wanted when he was going to like when I interact and have me available to him or have the news going to touch me. was distressing. I felt kind of trapped because i'm like I asked him to come out, I was kind of his host. I. realized that I didn't. I was representing having in there. So I was this week, I was supposed to be in Mexico to do dental tourism, while tom's down there for work. And I cancelled the trip at the last minute, because I didn't think I could handle being in proximity to him or navigating. The, for you know, like a country we don't speak the language. That is. Again yeah been just more easily triggered and more. Out of it and. embarrassed. This is only happened once. Who is this is pretty recent going to. A dental cleaning at the universities here dental school. and I ended up like. Losing sense of I guess the depth perception. And thinking that I was walking on the sidewalk, but it was actually walking in the street and took me a little bit to realize, and I was. In the lane and i'm like all right, like this isn't good now you're. A crazy person who needs to who's walking wandering in the street like let's get back on the sidewalk but. You know just. it's tough and there are a lot of things that I need to be doing for my own preservation like financially. That I haven't been able to get myself to do for like I don't know a year. And there are times in which yeah things will suddenly just get worse and i'll just get super overwhelmed. And just not really be able to function and, and this is kind of one of them, so I do a good job of hiding it most of the time. When i'm out in public. But it's exhausting and if I feel like that self control is slipping in I can kind of. Anna can. feel like i'm. Losing my mind. So."
726.0,Provider,Are Where are you living now what's your living situation. Where you're at.
16513.0,Patient,"I live in, probably the cheapest room in my whole county. Is a tiny eight by 11 room and a House that used to be their Home Office there's no closet that I have for housemates. And we have. it's basically a month to month lease. The Homeowners are going to sell the House i'm just not sure when. It sounds like it depends on. One person who's lived here for several years. I get along with everyone right now. I didn't when I first moved in but luckily this people have moved out. But I still. know will. interact with people on a pretty like limited basis i'm friendly and we talk and we can connect and laugh but. Experience other people in general, most of the time is draining. And if I. If I don't have to say I don't want to present like i'm put together thing I will isolate my room and I might come out at like late at night before I cook anything. So they know. bits and pieces of what I have going on, no details and I don't show them how upsetting him."
726.0,Provider,me a little bit about the you were talking about your finances how. Are you.
16513.0,Patient,"So I started off with like. Think when I was done at residential I think I had $22,000 in the Bank, and now I have like 3000. I do have some money in. Some account. That i'm not entirely sure how to access that was inheritance. and hope to save for. Housing at some point but i'm gonna have to tap into it soon, I think. I would qualify to reapply for the Washington state paid family medical leave, which gives you, you can give you like 12 weeks of financial assistance. And i've qualified to reapply for that since mid September, and I just haven't done it. My parents did take me to see a lawyer, a couple years ago, or a few years ago to talk about the possibility of. As SDI. And like what he thinks should be done with that inheritance money. and putting it into. Special Needs trust I guess. and So it's like I haven't done anything about that. Although I need to. yeah I would just do. occasional dog walking or like pet sitting little gigs. But it's not enough to get by and it's kind of scary."
726.0,Provider,For work before you want to. it's been.
16513.0,Patient,"My background is in mental health. I am. I have a doctoral degree in clinical psychology but I didn't get licensed. I worked for an organization that I, where I volunteered before Grad school. which provides like a crisis hotline and other crisis services. that were created them for three and a half years had to go and fly twice in that time and I left. That job after being a whistleblower. Because I was offered a job, as a. personal assistant for celebrity cartoonist but i've been pet sitting for. That did not go over very well. It was a six month contract and I lasted five months. And that's the last time I had my words. That end in. August I mean yeah the contract or he relieved me from duties anyway. In August of 2020. I had a third of boarded suicide attempt in July 2020. And I found it really hard to transition from that which no one knew about unless I told them. To this job that wasn't going well."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, you said you've done em Dr before. And how What was your experience like when you did that."
16513.0,Patient,"Oh. So i've done it technically with three providers one in residential one in php IP and then one with. Briefly, with someone. Many, many months ago. And he and I didn't continue working together, because I didn't know that the approach that my providers that are used in other in the treatment facilities was considered non traditional. and I loved what I got to do with them, it was. You know it's hard emotionally it's hard work, but it's like it almost feels like play. yeah because, like in one of my first sessions my you're talking about. How certain treatment providers, including prior to the person I work with your an outpatient. have described experience a wall a wall between us and finding me and accessible. And so it was really neat that that's what we worked on she's like okay so like imagine this wall and go touch the wall what's it made out of. And then she's like can you transform the wall into something else cool like yes it's a Tibetan singing bowl and instead of singing it's screaming and she's like what's it screaming so like just went through different emotions. In California had a cool session where my inner child and I crawled back into the womb. and had a. You know, a conversation about what that was like and. And that's one of the things I like about the guided imagery work that I do with Shannon as well as we can talk a lot in kind of. Like a symbols and there's like an ISS quality to it, and when I worked with the one of the other provider after discharge, I don't know if it's the fact that he's a man that made a difference. But the very direct approach are we had to work with explicit like concrete memories did not work for me like I. I really struggled to come up with examples of what he was asking for, and then it ended up being so triggering we had to stop. Because i'm like. I felt like I was going to throw up I couldn't feel my leg was. He was like i'm not sure him Dr is beneficial for you and, like, I know that it can be, and so I released the records to him from other providers and. he's like you write it you really did get stuff out of this it's just that's not how I work and so we're not going to be a good fit and haven't haven't found anyone read availability."
726.0,Provider,"i'm your work with other treatment providers that you felt like you've got something out of it. It may. Work with a specific memory and process it. Or how to be do was that, like. Different."
16513.0,Patient,It wasn't a specific memory. um. I think it was more like. there's a topic that we read. or oh gosh.
726.0,Provider,I wonder if that's a different I don't know cuz em Dr would be processing that like a specific memory. yeah um.
16513.0,Patient,"We were. Doing specific memories, at least that wasn't the intention, when I went into something like we might. pull up a thought, like our belief statement something like that and go into that and try and deconstruct it. And and shifter or shift explore maybe what the feelings are present. And and work with those and experience, though, the feeling safely. And then yeah like. i'm naturally a really curious person so. When providers, even in psychedelic treatment. i've struggled in like a psychedelic treatment and. When they asked me, you know, like like what else could could xp or. kind of tap into reality that's helpful. And like. In the GM work, which is a lot like em Dr it just doesn't have like a light bar cuz there's there's music. that's curated for whatever your intention is, which set an intention. And then it's just a matter of noticing what comes up. Trying to tolerate it. stick with it, and like sticking with the feelings and. noticing. Like is it a familiar feeling. and Like it mostly just exploring it and again trying to experience things safely."
726.0,Provider,"Because i'm. With that, because I, I really I try to always incorporate the somatic. way as well, but I wonder if what the different few wasn't em Dr it doesn't I don't know but it doesn't sound like em Dr."
16513.0,Patient,Had a light bar and or hand sensors and bilateral stimulation on headphones.
726.0,Provider,"Did they make you that they make you pick a target memory, a negative belief about oh yeah see that's a that's what you have Dr is I don't know. I mean i'm interested because it sounds like it was really great. A good experience yeah. But if it doesn't sound exactly like em Dr if not like. Something else I don't know."
16513.0,Patient,"They called it in DR but what I am learning is it's, whatever their approaches is not traditional. and They would say that it's you know, maybe a bit more. gentle like you're not having to pry open the person. I call it like a side door approach. Is when the demand I worked with briefly was trying to have me come up with a memory that was empowering like an explicit one that was really hard, because it was still tied to something traumatic. And, and so even that when he was wanting me to like go into that and kind of almost relive it that was triggering and. And we ended up having to stop. i'm not sure how. it's hard when when also memories and stuff is like in fragments when I don't have access to it or. Maybe verbal. it's hard to know how to. identify those and bring them into that model."
726.0,Provider,"It wasn't nothing now like am Dr I mean i'm sure there are parts of it that are mtr. Okay, only because I in my understanding of bmt ours. And people do it differently, but this is just like the I guess the cold like. The way of I even know the right words to say describe it, but it's like you pick a memory, the negative belief that that was experience from that experience and you process it and so that it is much more direct. than this other approach. So i'm wondering like. How, because we want, we could do is, we could do some other form of work with trauma that might not be mtr."
16513.0,Patient,What would it be.
726.0,Provider,"I mean, I think that come to you know, try to incorporate somatic work imagery work, maybe. doing some. Like parts work within. That might be helpful, because when you're getting overwhelmed or feeling. feeling overwhelmed by the experience or the thought it's because the memory is coming let's say from a child's perspective. it's very overwhelming because, as a child, you don't really know what to do with with what's going on, so your findings reacting in a way to tell that that timeframe. Even though you as an adult or. An adult now, but the memories are coming from a different time. So I don't know, I think that maybe the end Dr maybe two triggering. Okay, considers sorta. alone. I mean, I think. I want you to think about it, maybe and see what you would like to do, because I, I would be happy to work with you and we can do some other things that are not specifically on the bar, but we can we can incorporate a part of the mtr there that could be helpful for you."
16513.0,Patient,"There is. A Washington like medicaid system for mental health is really only through like Community clinics private providers like I understand California and she in California has much better system. I have found a Community clinic here, where I could do mtr. In person with someone who says that he does like if s. Type stuff and things that he could blend it maybe you're closer to what i've experienced before. reservation that I have about working with with him, though, is. New is the gender concern like it had been recommended because of some of the trauma to try to work with a female provider. So that's a question I guess that I would also have for just bright heart health in general, too, is. Like, is it possible for us to try a session for you and I, to try session or maybe, for he and I to try a session and see how that works see my comfort level. let's say that. I have a surprisingly good connection with Pam and I want to do em Dr through the public clinic but I, like the trauma group they put her health offers what I you know way bright heart health, allow me to stay in the trauma group only."
726.0,Provider,"i'm because I invite heart health, I can offer us for em vr but here's your actual therapist so you've been assigned is. Christine Christine so with Christine you could do like the groundwork of of of kind of identifying all of these things with her. And don't be able to do your groups. And then you know because, even with em Dr we don't go straight away and start targeting a memory, it takes, we want to. get a history of the person want to get arm like make sure that they're in a stable place in their life to be able to process to. And so, like, I know you talked a little bit about your living situation and so i'm thinking like would it be appropriate to process trauma work when you don't when you don't know if you're going to stay where you're at now. yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"I don't think that there's a risk of us moving anytime in like the near future. I do find it stressful i've moved a lot. And that's something that stresses me out that i've asked. The Community place here in Washington i'm like hey, even if I don't do any therapy with you guys Do you still provide case management. Like local resources can we see what alternative housing options are that are more stable, so it isn't just you know I don't have hanging over my head when's the next time that I have to move."
726.0,Provider,"But if you like, it's up to you what would you like to do you have an option, I can I can work with you and we can work on. On doing other things, maybe not specifically processing trigger memories, but we could do other things that might be helpful on and or you could meet with Christina your next appointment talk to her and then see what she thinks about it. Okay, and see and see what you like to do. Okay. Because I love going anywhere i'm still going to be here, you know, so you know, even if let's say you're with Christine and you try out this this person on it for four and Dr if it doesn't work out i'm still here we don't have to go straight into processing, we could do some maybe more. Try more somatic. somatic work i'm doing more internal internal child were trying to get her to feel safe. before she starts to do any of that work right because she's scared she's like I don't know what to expect and I don't know these people so i'm of course she's not going to go into processing like you know those memories yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"She might not be ready, she might not feel ready for that yeah. I am. I am smiling because maybe such a Defense mechanism, because I feel like a total. Like I feel like a bit of a monster admitting this yeah my relationship with my inner kiddo can use some work. When I do sessions involving her including like in psychedelic stuff she typically dies either I kill her. or she's involved in some sort of accident so. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"I know that this sounds really far out probably not but i'll say it anyway, and just do is think of it is there's there's also this key point of generational trauma and it's really sometimes, and I know this sounds off the charts weird but sometimes i'm. Even as children if you're having trauma yourself and your family has experienced trauma, you could have. dormant traumatic memories that could either be yours, or they could be connected to your junk the other generations as well."
16513.0,Patient,"Oh, that. gosh man that sounds almost scary because then it's like i'm still trying to figure out with the the little fragmented memories what's real and what isn't. And so, then, how do I know. Who was mine and what is it."
726.0,Provider,"There is a really awesome book i'm going to show it to you really quick, because I think it could be useful, because what. Also, with trauma it's like if it happens, like two or three generations ago whether you know about what happened or not there's a mutation that happened in the DNA sequence, so it. will transfer over you might have more of a sensitivity to certain triggers just just based on genetics right."
16513.0,Patient,"So yeah. Like so you're talking up you genetics, is the book yeah just. start with you."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, that's the one that I was going to show you yeah yeah."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah I read that one that was really that was interesting and that's why I often think now about. Like my mom's experience my grandmother's experience in relation to what ever i'm going through, particularly from like where's this coming from it. yeah yeah."
726.0,Provider,"And if you're working with your child self and you find it really hard to have that connection with her it's I always try to say that people like bring like if you were to. If you were to bring in somebody whether they were really not that could help you or to help her feel safe. Right, so if let's say i'm five years old in my memory and i'm feeling really unsafe. i'm just going to make it up and i'll you know Oh, I saw the mom that was in this show, and she she was really good to her kids in that show, and you know, maybe i'll bring her and maybe she can make my kids self a little bit better. So right so it's just like you're bringing in support for that child. to feel a little bit safer, because if we can infer shifting it before if we want to shift how we feel now. We want to like work with that child and it's like, how can I have a little bit more compassion and love for that child that didn't know what to do, she didn't know, maybe, how to deal with all of the things to have control over anything so. Just thoughts just. yeah nothing that you have to do nothing, they have to take with you."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah no self compassion, is a is an area for growth for me. yeah for sure I in my second ketamine injection one of my biggest takeaways was that. Self compassion showed up as a literal devil. And my. The person facilitating the session was like Okay, you can get closer to this and I was like talk to the devil. You know, like but it's the devil and I couldn't get over it kind of that that imagery."
726.0,Provider,"So, to protect itself because maybe of deconstructing that child self it's going to deconstruct your reality, right now, of where you're at or maybe relationships, by opening that up does that make any sense I don't even know me, since we said it."
16513.0,Patient,not really but maybe it's just my brain not processing it.
726.0,Provider,"Oh it's like as if you were to open up the door for that child self it could deconstruct your whole reality of where you are now. And it might be really scary to deconstruct that so that child might not be ready for the intense trauma work it might just need to figure out what what's what's going on what's happening around me that i'm feeling this unsafe so it's connected with the child, but. Sometimes, if we deconstructing little parts of us it totally changes our lenses of the world and of the life that we've had."
16513.0,Patient,"yeah okay. Thank you one thing, just to clarify how this would work, but we have sessions twice a month."
726.0,Provider,"yeah and it's it's more because i'm, not because I don't want to do weekly cuz I I prefer weekly it's just that. Are my caseload is I have so many people, that is a hard and and you know if i'm going to work with someone, I want to try to do the best work that can't with them, I don't want to do it half in it, I want to really go in and help you and going."
16513.0,Patient,Okay. That makes sense.
726.0,Provider,"So i'm just you haven't won. The 23rd. With Christine so. take time, you know, let the information percolate of what you would like to do. And if you do want to work with me i'm happy to work with you. And I. And you can schedule another appointment."
16513.0,Patient,How. How would I schedule that appointment.
726.0,Provider,"So so just i'm not scheduling thing only because I want you to think about it and decide what you want to do, you can just call virtual clinic and make an appointment. Okay, with me."
