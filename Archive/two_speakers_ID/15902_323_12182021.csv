It looked out for me when I was in a joint they're the only ones so look out for me and enjoying they're the only ones that stayed in contact with me and as far and few in between. Right so in a way, I felt like I kind of know them something, because there are some love there. But then when I got out and I moved in with them and I seen the disrespect and that you know just in the heroin usage and. It was just nothing was good, coming from that. yeah nothing. I wasn't getting mentally abused, I was getting verbally."
323.0,Provider,abused.
15902.0,Patient,For real not joke.
323.0,Provider,When you came out did you know that they were using heroin.
15902.0,Patient,"I had my assumptions, but no like i'd be on the phone with theme and you're like damn bro you saw I. spoke he's like man i'm just tired man I work all day, and you know, in my mind, I was like man he's getting I. But I didn't know you know so when I got out they couldn't hide it. You know i'm saying. And you're dropping your phone and. Cigarettes are falling on your fingers and come on. it's terrible and that's what kept me sober."
323.0,Provider,He saw what you didn't want to do.
15902.0,Patient,yeah i'm not doing that.
323.0,Provider,yeah. And they know you're on a program.

Because I have a couple people that i'm in touch with so they came up from Columbus. came i'm seeing me up in Toledo, will they come pick me up in my house and you know went up for reside wings and stuff like that. So I you know it just number dog number hate and you know are your corny for the you know you know, Sam you know what that was I was all knowledge, what do you mean them corny. Right now, is that's what I got out of that. knowledge is power you don't gotta beat up somebody."
323.0,Provider,"Well, you don't be little someone else to feel better that doesn't work that way. Right, but you know I mean if you're actively using you're not thinking straight anyway, so you know that."
15902.0,Patient,"I put up with it, as long as I could you."
323.0,Provider,"So it must have been strange for them, though, to see you get it together pretty. quickly when you got out, yes, I know you live there for a little while, but you set your mind to some changes and you went after it."
15902.0,Patient,yeah two months. That was.
323.0,Provider,crazy for them to see.
15902.0,Patient,"our minds, I can only imagine. yeah as much as is different for me doing it like wow and me and they're looking at me thinking man i'm five time prison their you know their thoughts of me moving in, and you know it was nothing like I went there like oh."
323.0,Provider,"Who is this person. wow. good for you, those are all rewards, to be able to look back and see where you could be versus where you want to be now. And all of us coming together for you."

15902.0,Patient,"yeah and sober and new I get paid more. All it's an organization. it's You know, as I kinda still look for what do you call that. Like in north or not organized but. No like no program type deal I don't know the word i'm looking for, but I. starts with an S, I want to say SP. I don't know but yeah I kind of like things when they're in order and there's a you know i'm saying there's a there's a way to go about doing something. structure structure there it is."
323.0,Provider,lecture is good structure helps helps hold us accountable.
15902.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,"So yes, that is good and it sounds like this business that you're working with now he's pretty structured and he knows what he's getting done and. deadlines and. goals and stuff like that."
15902.0,Patient,"there's the atmosphere is the you know I totally you know I don't have to. burn myself I got to relax and just go to work. And then, when i'm done i'll go home, you know, then there is no attachments and right, yes, every day, is better every day. Good yeah."
323.0,Provider,"What do you attribute this. Fast trajectory I set some goals i'm going to keep moving towards them I know it was mindset, I know it was positive attitude. motivation, I mean, how do you explain it."
15902.0,Patient,"lot of people don't like hearing that answer, but instead of saying I don't know how that's how. My faith is there."
323.0,Provider,Do you think this time in prison changed you Stephen. Or did you always have buried in you.
15902.0,Patient,"yeah I was always a good morals good values I was raised right, you know i'm saying I just didn't go that way and everybody always asked me says, Dan time, of all people do. You grew up in $100,000 home, and this, you know back in the 80s 90s hundred thousand our House was a nice House back then. And you know my parents drink and smoke pot, but they weren't into the you know the hard drugs that I know bills got paid I there's food on the table, I I didn't see too much, I mean some of it i've seen but. I wanted to go out and find a I was attracted to the fast and. I I went to the bad areas that was what I was interested in."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah and where we spend time is often what we will become.
15902.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,"i'm just curious because and maturity and age definitely plays a part in it, but you're in that cycle for a long time, and you couldn't find your way out in this time, you came out and you found your way out."
15902.0,Patient,"Did I know. It really was a. Just had to do it, you know you just. There was a line that you just had to draw. You just you know in them Okay, here it is. You stop caring about what somebody thinks about."
323.0,Provider,yeah no longer matters it's not going to dictate how you feel about yourself.
15902.0,Patient,"hey it's really that's what it was, it was to the point of what I thought about some way somebody thought about me or cared about me, but then, when I looked at it list. I can separate myself from you and i'll never see you ever again. If I wanted to be that way."
323.0,Provider,Whatever lights which worked for you keep it keep it on. Because you know I mean a few months down the road sobriety working house car no telling how good you're gonna feel.
15902.0,Patient,"man in a year. i'm making more money, and I do when I first started, and this is where i'm at and the two months and i'm not going back there was not an absent it ain't even a thought in my mind it isn't. it's just totally lost his past, to me it really is, you know people say Oh, I hear stories all the time of. I was sober for seven years, and then I relapsed i'm thinking to myself Do I need to worry about that. I might keep that worried there. yeah but it feels like there is that option isn't there, you must have left that an option for yourself to be able to go back. right that option isn't there."
323.0,Provider,"Well, in there's a complacency that happens after being in recovery for a while, like it would never happen to me the temptations not going to come, but it will still come, you have to be ready for it, no matter if you have one year in five years in or 20 years in. There will be that day that you just feel vulnerable and life sucks and you're just like i'll just drink it away or i'll just drug it away and. You got to be stronger and ahead of it, and no way or supports in resources are and for some it's prayer for summits sponsorship and meetings and things like that to know where you're going to go to breathe through that craving so that you don't act on it. So yeah, but I think when you hear people that have had a long time in recovery, and then they relapse they get comfortable. And that comfortable is like yeah you can you can have just one drink it'll be fine. it's not going to work that way. Because today, tomorrow, maybe even for six months, you can handle one drink."
15902.0,Patient,Right.
323.0,Provider,But whatever you were used to do it before you will go to that amount and even greater in order to take that feeling again. it's not worth it.
15902.0,Patient,"I do know that. I don't like I don't want to be around people who's always like going through sobriety. I go to sobriety, but I can go to sobriety not talking about surviving. You know I don't like."
323.0,Provider,To welling and they want to work. Right you don't want to hear about it all the time.
15902.0,Patient,"No that doesn't keep me so for some people it's you know. Hearing the story I look more of as hearing people's stories is glorifying. Or you know, because in a way, is man, you know what I did listen to this story."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
15902.0,Patient,"I got them to i'm just saying you know this, not a conversation I get in when I get in a conversation with the person I am attracted the conversation about not not as sexual attraction it's. An attraction. I like talking to smart, people like talking to people who who don't waste my time with stories of. negative. That doesn't. i'm a self help type dude I like hearing that. And i'm like knowledge, I like. Real like biographies and. Like now it's shown, yes, David I don't want to hear none urbano vampire werewolf. That."
323.0,Provider,"Well you're in you're right the dangerous way, because in those stories and people start to compare well my story is worse than yours and before you know it you're in a negative conversation."
15902.0,Patient,"mm hmm my story is better oh yeah yes, do you know what do you tell a story for are you trying to impress somebody. Right."
323.0,Provider,"And when that's not the lifestyle, you want to be in unit, you have no interest in having those conversations like you're saying. that's not interesting anymore. good for you, things are going great."
15902.0,Patient,So we'll work on.
323.0,Provider,Go ahead what.
15902.0,Patient,I did have an issue with getting my medication this week.
323.0,Provider,What happened.
15902.0,Patient,"My insurance wouldn't pay for it on till the day that my script ran out, which is understanding, but the way my prescription works is I take it once in the morning, once in the afternoon once at night. yeah when my prescription runs out that night they can't fail it to the next day. I go to bed in the morning. I go to work at 730 I can't leave until so my morning and my afternoon isn't there you know i'm saying."
323.0,Provider,yeah I do know what you're saying.
15902.0,Patient,"So I mean it was frustrating, you know but there's nothing I could do about it. I don't feel this the correct way about it for them to do that, I think they should let me at least double up one day come on man i'm not an addict i'll give you a urine test whenever you want. All you will see, is suboxone."
323.0,Provider,"Let me send a note to Dr cell and see if there is a bridge. it's more of the pharmacy issue, probably, then it is ours in terms of. But I don't know if there's a way that she could do a bridge that has a day. covered so that you don't hit two doses you don't miss two doses when you're running out at night."
15902.0,Patient,So just insurance that had nothing.
323.0,Provider,To.
15902.0,Patient,Do with a. Good arm. Nothing at all. I was starting to get frustrated pharmacy and then he pulled out the paper you showed to me like look you're Stearns isn't going to pay for it.
323.0,Provider,"Because you're already on it, they don't want to give you any more. till you're completely run out. The problem is like you said there's that gap in time. Okay."
15902.0,Patient,"So we're going to came up against there's a shelf life was a box and in you know I know eventually you got to work down off of these things but. In one of my buddies tells me suboxone you're still getting nighttime you're still on drugs that's what he kept on telling me just to. make themselves feel better right, I said well you know what the differences, while i'm on my soapbox and is that i'm not running out breaking in homes trying to get high that's different that's what suboxone helps me not to do. Right, you know there's a level there okay so i'm not on drugs and that's. What I tell people i'm not. You know. analysis with my anxiety to it really does you know it does more than get me passes sobriety thing. I get frustrated quick, you know i'm saying my inside he goes through the roof sometimes sometimes I have to. Remember me telling you took me nine hours to realize what I was doing."
323.0,Provider,Right.
15902.0,Patient,You know so slow down.
323.0,Provider,relax calm yourself down yeah.
15902.0,Patient,"yeah you know, so I still have that anxiety and I don't want more medication."
323.0,Provider,I know you don't want more i'm just trying to think of how we can cover. Especially with this being the holiday time if there's a day that we can somehow do.
15902.0,Patient,"Or maybe give me. overlap trust me to give me or i'll can do with that twice a month, instead of four times a month."
323.0,Provider,yeah on weekly as don't want to.
15902.0,Patient,give it to me every two weeks or once a month.
323.0,Provider,yeah. Wait you're just went on mute. once a month doesn't. come for a while.
15902.0,Patient,that's all I mean unless you can figure it out your way that that'd be awesome.
323.0,Provider,i'll send a note to Dr cell and see so for when will you. Writing it from Wednesday to Wednesday right now. And so you miss Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon.
15902.0,Patient,gives me eight days.

323.0,Provider,Right.
15902.0,Patient,"She was to always give me eight days. Probably because, so I didn't flop that day. Right that's what i'm thinking. You know there's nothing extra ever."
323.0,Provider,"Okay. i'll see what she says she's usually pretty good at figuring out some fixes around this stuff. Besides, you being out of beside you're traveling tomorrow you're not going to be out of town for. The Christmas holiday into new year, or anything like that."
15902.0,Patient,"as of right now, no but. we'll see if family wants me around I would love to go. On think i'ma go my dad's way I think of my sister asked me to go i'll go, but my dad's way. No okay."
