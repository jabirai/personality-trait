4272.0,Patient,I did go to the doctor I don't know if it really matters last week. I ended up missing work to I guess.
207.0,Provider,yeah you went to the doctor.
4272.0,Patient,They were.
207.0,Provider,I think that's. Not. yeah I can't hear anything you're saying.
4272.0,Patient,my head. Can you hear me.
207.0,Provider,Okay. Okay. So. You think it's the headset.
4272.0,Patient,Sometimes that's the problem. I got like. i'm a welder so my phone gets a lot of metal in it and I can't even use my regular phone. I have to use some kind of bluetooth speakers because. All my phones they always get mad on them from were doing well and you get a little metal shavings in your phone.
207.0,Provider,"So would it be, is it that you will not able to leave your phone like in a locker and why not."
4272.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, then in a. factory. model, you always end up screwing up your phone really quick. But I went to the doctor and. My my dad was worried, more or less but. I didn't have. Had a stomach flu or poisoning because i've been at shark shirt and pains and having to use the bathroom. And I missed like two days of work so. I don't know whenever you guys have I usually don't just call one day I was sick as a dog. I literally just. went to sleep so so."
207.0,Provider,"Hopefully, they gave me something for it."
4272.0,Patient,yeah they did it didn't work right. They gave him stuff right there in the office and I ended up getting sick again before even. But I went back to work. This week i'm good. Better.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, your turn. hi."
4272.0,Patient,"What i'm sorry this doesn't sound all that well for me, probably works better, for you to finally hear me but. This is a nine, oh no i'm sorry."
207.0,Provider,"No, no, no, no, I sent you a chart. looks like i'm being at risk. having fun."
4272.0,Patient,Because I missed last week.
207.0,Provider,"Oh, you, you can be at risk for suicide from missing an appointment."
4272.0,Patient,Oh first.
207.0,Provider,"Let me look at your your. Yes, Okay, so you just. Hearing when off the chart."
4272.0,Patient,"I know what it is, because when I when I talked to you before. answering the surveys like and everything and I probably answered it more true than I ever have and it's probably not used to seeing. me answer. i'm not saying I don't I don't answer it accurately, but I don't."
207.0,Provider,"whoa Aaron is never answered. very much. hi oh yeah he get real, serious so. No, that is no that is not, I mean i'm looking at your anxiety. and your. pH to nine and it says that it's pretty mild, though."
4272.0,Patient,yeah well it's.
207.0,Provider,"Interesting I like that and. Now we trapping you, and then you go make a mistake and go go get a stomach virus and Miss Oh, we really got him laugh. No, no. No. Okay, well, it did see it didn't show in So this is the thing. According to the survey so when i'm looking at it did say it was pretty mild I would say I do encourage people to answer, honestly, but at the same time um. So, but at the same time I would listen what I really encourage you to do is. Is when you're answering when you're answering the the gad seven it's a generalized anxiety survey and then the php nine it's checking for your level of Depression and anxiety. And so, as I was asking the question the questions are as it's related to the type of training that you're completing. So, like it asks a question like generally have you been feeling more down or depressed or I mean sorry down and having no pleasure, well, I mean if I listen like right now I need to eat, so I, my feeling yes. I am nervous. i'm nervous because I need to eat I need some sugar in my system. You understand. So you have a stomach virus and you sleeping more than usual yeah because your body is saying listen, let me relax and repair itself. it's not as it's not based on how the screening so it's keep it in context to the type of screening you're doing and it's but if it is really that you are feeling a certain way. Because of everything that's going on as it's related like when we talked to the last time. And yes, it's in context to that So is there some ptsd and ptsd a lot of it is like the anxiety, the fear of reliving a particular trauma that you've been through. I know that you have your children and you're not necessarily in contact or communication with them as you would like. Is there some depression surrounding that there's a possibility you're currently in a relationship it, are you going through some things in your relationship and. Really, not knowing is it going to work out is there some blame or guilt is it whatever as it's related to that, then answer the question as it's related to that, and so we will work on that, but I mean how you work overnight you tired, are you tired. i'm tired so it's keeping it in context but. You know the system is not ready okay. So um but I mean it's so what you're saying okay so like holding that piece of it, you went to the doctor so you're feeling a little bit better in terms of your okay okay so. yeah that's good that you're feeling better in that regard, I know, the last time we were we met, I know you have to there was a lot going on, because I think you have to take you for your girlfriend card to go get tired or something like that."
4272.0,Patient,"yeah yeah bunch of stuff going on and I got in a wreck. I pretty much told my truck I hit a deer. And it destroyed a lot, and so I had to do all that work myself. cost a lot of money and a lot of time. So that messes with work too and just."
207.0,Provider,So you've been missing a lot of hours at work.
4272.0,Patient,"I was I missed that's why I got switched over to third shift. It was making me miss during the day I didn't have my truck and. I could have a right at night. It took a while to get me switch. Like I was missing work days and just let me come in at night shift now and i'll just come to work I don't want to miss work and finally got everything situated kind of just working night shift, and now I got both cars back on the road, so that things are working out a little bit better."
207.0,Provider,that you would like to work.
4272.0,Patient,On.
207.0,Provider,"And I know you talked about. outside of braveheart. hasn't you ever. outside of our head, have you ever had individual therapy."
4272.0,Patient,i've had it like when I was a kid. When I was a kid. My dad was a. Very visual person. After him and my mom but we're not a baby or whatever he got with a very abusive person. around her kids were very abusive so. I started having problems younger.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and did you find it to be effective, so were you diagnosed with."
4272.0,Patient,"I don't know if they they tried. Basically, putting me on depression stuff and like ADHD and all kinds of stuff like that and. My mom found out and she was a nun over so. pretty much everyone everywhere and never I don't think I took stuff very long."
207.0,Provider,"So i'm now the. You live you live, you live with your dad."
4272.0,Patient,just got bounced around a lot. But. yeah anytime I was with. His ex wife. Ever is the abusive to.
207.0,Provider,Did she did okay did she um she okay so she was. A bit longer her kids were older.
4272.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and then um did he did he was he aware of her the abuse that."
4272.0,Patient,"Basically, shows. Basically, just deflect everything that she was doing to me or having kids do to turn that back around and try to tell that that story to my dad that that that was made, basically, and it kind of went on for years. And so. My family had to step in for my mom started like getting in the middle of it, because he would not listen. I would get be I got through through a wall get through downstairs like art wouldn't steps and almost broke my bag and a lot of things had to happen from the finally realized like it wasn't me it was your why, like, I guess, he didn't want to believe a grown adult be like that. So, instead, he lived his son. was just. That as a kid I guess I don't know. I took a while like years to finally start seeing like she was."
207.0,Provider,Where you left with her a lot.
4272.0,Patient,yeah. That would always happen.
207.0,Provider,huh.
4272.0,Patient,"And I guess I didn't even care about that it was the worst part was like bench to tell him when he got home because you know, obviously i'm hurt and i'm gonna tell my dad so she would tell him I would do this stuff to her or her kids and and we get beat from him to. Pretty screwed up."
207.0,Provider,And how long how long before they got into more.
4272.0,Patient,"years. And then they tried to. Work things out a couple years later and it's just too obvious. what had happened, and that was really doing things by then, I was getting older, so they couldn't really. High stuff like that anymore, they can just blame it on me, I was old enough to know better and hold up the pickup or myself. You know, so it just didn't work out at all."
207.0,Provider,"When you so, you said that you eventually you started going to therapy and they diagnose, I mean, I guess, because of your acting out behavior they mistook it for ADHD attention deficit."
4272.0,Patient,"yeah they're trying to figure out what. class. This. is very sleepy a lot and. just sit score the regular thing that people should be no problem sit there in school, and I could never just got worse. I couldn't pay attention I. don't think I ever got. diagnosed correctly or anything. This one under the radar."
207.0,Provider,"I mean it's that's a lot, I mean, so you know, maybe your your anxiety, or just the ptsd and trauma from that and just so after that did you did you have a good relationship with your dad."
4272.0,Patient,"And he changed to quit drinking and, as I call it to. And he changed his life his life to God and ended up being a preacher like for years before he died. Though yeah it took years but we started. Getting a lot closer. He. He became a really good guy I mean here's a here's a marine is a he always kept an awesome job like he was a prison guard for 30 years. very hard worker. But. took a while to get to the good side of."
207.0,Provider,"So do you think like even if you struggle. A lot even for yourself trying to. Stay committed to your responsibility or connect. Whether it be with your children or in relationships. Do you find that you struggle with it. And that's not that's not a normal, given that arm. But you know even throughout the years even up until this point um have you found any effectiveness or done any real work in arm therapy related to your past and just even the struggle, even with me. Have you found any real arm."
4272.0,Patient,and basically just. Trying to focus on. worker. But all my focus there never really. kind of focused on that.
207.0,Provider,"So you want to just use the word to the structure itself from. You know your your anxiety or depression or anything like that yeah. So one of the goals, and I know you talked about you know, one of the goals, and I would say to continue to meeting you know twice a week communicating anytime that there's any changes or you know, having to cancel your appointment and you know just working on. being more open. About. Just. know. What at what time do you find that you experience more if you're you know anxiety, or you have flashbacks from your past whatever do you find it more. At night during the day, if you didn't have an argument with your girlfriend and just kind of your struggles and just be open and honest even about your struggles, even within your own addiction and how have you been you know. You know even do you find it very hard and have real struggles in maintaining recovery or sobriety."
4272.0,Patient,don't. push it push it.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, if think about this is our problems, and I think naturally a lot of us do that until you start learning how to recognize it be more aware. Of what it is that we're doing and why we have the struggles that we have, and so I don't know like they're in Ohio like here in Florida there's different parts that they have the dumps like the garbage dump right and it's like a dump it forms a hill. And how do we, what did they use the form this hill at the Dome today you."
4272.0,Patient,just keep on.
207.0,Provider,"The garbage the garbage and, over time, it creates this mount right. yeah and that's the that's exactly what we do, we take the garbage and all of the things that we've gone through and instead of sorting through it we just. Just we just push it to the side and create this mountain and eventually our troubles have created this large mountain."
4272.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,Why are you laughing.
4272.0,Patient,i'm just thinking like how big one. yeah i'd rather not think about her deal with it because I don't know how.
207.0,Provider,"i'm. i'm sorry, like everybody in my my husband my son my daughter everybody messaging me because my kid and I literally said to you do, you have practice, no, no, I don't but he texts me Oh, I have you got to pick up my little brother."
4272.0,Patient,You got the puppy.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, that's the one I got this down I literally as soon as I was dropping into school, do you have basketball practice there's no. And then you're texting me and now because I didn't respond to him he's texting him but he's texting his sister for like alert yummy to figure out how to pick up my little brother don't kid I swear. um but you know if. The truth of the matter is. The more we ignore our issues it doesn't go away, it just creates keep creating this Big Mountain. And the only way so that at some point, once you become aware of this mountain that has created he tried to figure out oh my God it's just so high i'm not going to turn the deal with that, and you. know, but you still have you still have to chip away at it, you still really have to chip away at it, because what what happens when you if you've ever been especially in the heart of the summer I mean here it's summer you're around practically so whenever you pass this Dome. doesn't it alert everybody from miles, that the dump it in there. And how does it alerted."
4272.0,Patient,"By vision visual mean you can see it, you can smell it so like."
207.0,Provider,"Not only can I, even though I could smell the dump and guess what we got vultures that highlighting hey. guess what let's highlight all of the issues that's going on right here, because this is here and that's literally what happened. We ignore it, but while you want to ignore that there everybody around us can see it, they can smell it and hey there are people that highlighting that this is existing and until you come to that place of being more aware and working on it. It will decrease, a lot of those those unwanted stressors that are in our life. So, ignoring our problems doesn't make it go away, it just makes it larger and larger and larger and larger."
4272.0,Patient,"I guess. My way of dealing with all that is like. Basically I feel. If I do good. Like I was no good is like basically you can't get into heaven, just like doing good good to. US and just. Do good enough things at work are i'd be i'd be a good person. Basically that's my way of dealing with it like I just tried to. Basically, this tip the scales better."
207.0,Provider,"But this is just how we convince ourselves to keep ignoring it so like you said, who said that by doing good deeds will get you into heaven."
4272.0,Patient,Is in the Bible.
207.0,Provider,"But I thought you said somebody told me that it's in the same token, you can't say it also is in the Bible says you can't say you love me, but then you hate your brother right. So we have to go. And you have to make it right with your brother. So that sentence alone black man anybody gonna listen. Do i'm done he has done me some raw and by that time for him, but you cannot say you love me, but then you still see you hate your brother. So you will make it right with your brother, it means that we have to go, we have to, we have to do the work we have to go through the pain we have to go through that and work through it all so when it's all said and done. it's going back to. i'm doing all of this, and a lot of people hey you know what i'm just going to go do all of this good i'm going to go feed the hungry i'm going to go do this and i'm going to go do that. But at the end of the day we do all of that, but then the people who we need to go forgive and we need to work on who the people that we've hurt, for we refuse to talk to the one who's done it to us. it's the same way that God says number friends, you can do all of these good beats but hey you still got work to do over here, and you can't run away from it, because this is, ultimately, this is what we do. you're running and you're running and you're running but guess what's holding on to your to the back of you all of the problem i'm going right along with you. know how, no matter how far you run the problems are still hanging on and it's going right along with you, so at some point you gotta stop. And you gotta you gotta unload. You have to unload issues. We have to face. The fear, we have to allow ourselves. to feel the pain of sorrow, we have to allow ourselves. to feel the pain of regret, we have to allow ourselves to do these things. So it's coming to identify. What is it that."
4272.0,Patient,"i'm trying to. make things right and. Even felling more. So, like. things going. Well it's just like. When you try. and sell more when you do try, then it basically just like you get to where, like so many things go wrong. When all you're trying to do is make it right. Can you get to where you just. You feel like. i'm better off not trying, because every time I do try things start going bad."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, when you try when you try something do you and you fail at it, do you take a step back and re evaluate or do you just go back and try again."
4272.0,Patient,I just try and try and try and it just never got right.
207.0,Provider,"listen to what I just asked when you fail, the first time, do you take a step back to we evaluate the situation before you try again, or do you just jump right back into trying to get."
4272.0,Patient,don't know.
207.0,Provider,"Why, maybe one day, my friend, you always gonna fail, or something you'll never read it's kind of like when you're thinking about. You Okay, so you have a little kid I have a little kid. And when we're teaching him to learn the bicycle right you take off the first, you have the training wheels. So he's going to keep writing and try to keep up with everybody why because he has the comfort of the training wheels the training was not going to really let you fall because no matter what you do. The training wheels that kicks out it's going to always talk right so you're the training wheels never teach you how to have balance. it's never going to teach you how to have balance, because if you if you if you ever go off balance. The one side is going to stop you from falling and if you go this way, the other side is going to stop you from falling part so buddy Let me take off training wheel okay you jump on the bike What do you do you just look straight ahead and you just go on track and what's gonna happen."
4272.0,Patient,yeah oh.
207.0,Provider,Why you don't fall.
4272.0,Patient,yourself balanced.
207.0,Provider,"But if I keep jumping back on the bike and keep going i'm always going to fail at it simply because I never got the concept, you have to learn how to maintain your balance. And how do you do that, you can't be eager it's not you got to be quick to win the race hey I got to study what is my distance what's my level of enduring Am I am I, my my my fully hydrated did I do everything that I need to do it's not about winning the race, I have to be fully equipped. So I will fail at whatever I go at doing if I don't stop to see Am I really quick to do this, how is this race even semi. engaged in something no business engaging. Looking at the reality of life."
4272.0,Patient,Until so.
207.0,Provider,I keep failing. Because I never stopped. Why is it. That I keep failing.
4272.0,Patient,"taking a step back and saying how to do right, what do you need to do it right, and you know, make the same mistakes."
207.0,Provider,"So I fear failing the very thing I keep failing at it simply because I feel, because at some point, I have to take ownership point. i'm not reevaluating I am eager I am impatient and I just want to be quick in comparison to what it is that I need to learn to perfect what it is that i'm doing. How can I be a good husband or a good father, when I don't take a step back to look at why every relationship I engaging it keeps failing. Why every time I attempt to be the father that my son or my daughter needs, because every time I go at it, I keep going at it, the way my father did not recognizing hey where's the 40 line is this. The way my father spoke to me was. that the same way i'm talking to my child, like you, when my dad taught me about that, so what am I doing, where is this coming from. frustration. But why am I frustrated because I know, no other way I don't we evaluate. And the reason why I cannot read evaluate. It simply because. of fear of failing. Because I am too impatient and too eager to get it right, the first time, without taking a step back and. Listen."
4272.0,Patient,This is the deepest conversations.
207.0,Provider,"you're having it's listen it's. it's a time. Maybe this is a homework that I can give you for the next let's see that we meet on the 28th. And it says we meet at three o'clock I don't know why they put with three o'clock but just commit to the i'll leave the three o'clock on there and wait to come at 230. But you know. I want you to do this. I want you to reflect a little bit and in your reflection, when you reflect about. What it is that you need to this is what we're going to do in the next time we're going to work on, I want you to come up really with what is it that you personally need to work on, I want you to identify one thing and we're going to do one thing at a time. And each time we're going to work, whatever we're going to work on we're going to do it just for a month, but i'm going to give you this, I want you to reflect and I want you to think what is it that you're you're that you find yourself struggling with daily. I want you to identify what is it that you find yourself struggling with daily that increases your anxiety at the thought of making this change or engaging and change. If it is something as. Small right now as you're in a relationship and you find that you're you're constantly bumping heads, I want you to what is it that what is my biggest fear. About engaging and change or or I want you to reflect. But in your reflection point out at what point do you find that you're inviting. Are super smart intelligent system is gone. But I want you, I want you to just identify in your reflecting, whether it be about your relationship, whether it be about work at what point do you find consistent through any form of reflection, do you find that your anxiety improve. and which one brings you. Increased anxiety is it the relationship with your children is it your work, where do you find that you have a lot of struggle that. That i'm 10th you. To error, where you find the real struggle when it comes on even with your sobriety. Because, whatever you're struggling with. is where your greatest temptation to relax coming. Your struggle is not really with the drug. it's really with the deeper rooted issue is that you keep pushing."
4272.0,Patient,The garbage.
207.0,Provider,"and that's what I want you to do. When we meet in two weeks, we will create your treatment plan based on the one thing that you find consistently. That increases your heart rate and in your reflection, you find you have an increased trigger or are craving to use to suppress. That anxiety because that's that's the thing it's all about you suppressing whether you're smoking, whether cigarette marijuana or you drink, whatever it is you use that method of coping to suppress. That smelly garbage."
4272.0,Patient,yeah. Okay yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Alright, so I will see you on Thursday okay. alright. Have a good one."
4272.0,Patient,Thank you.
