Instead of that, four day supply you know. I think that, let me see here like like when I look at this last note really quickly. I think that I could actually. i'm going to call in the eight day supply and then i'm going to let Dr Saul know um she and I have report, to which I don't believe that that would be disrespectful to her, I think the circumstances warrant it and."
11942.0,Patient,judgment.
165.0,Provider,"Right yep nope absolutely and I think that, and I think that if there was a time that I could enact something that you know. An exception here or there, I which I never do because i'm not I just I don't, but I think that this would be the time so. and getting hooked up with such a such a good. Now I am going to do this, though, because it is after 7pm your standard time i'm going to do that in the in the morning, which is going to be around around noon your time only because that's just the policy, and so, if i'm gonna if i'm going to cut corners, I want to cut only one um. And so i'm going to put in here the chess up and that is for schedule reminders appointment reminders. i'm just still sending that text message and talking to myself here."
11942.0,Patient,You find your very outgoing that love you I can't.
165.0,Provider,"I have one, I have one daughter she drives me insane."

165.0,Provider,"Okay, so now, you have my direct line if you need me if you don't hear from me around 1pm your time tomorrow go ahead and give me a call or text me a text messages are honestly way better cheryl because i'm here all the time. So if you need to shoot me a text and say hey What about my prescription go feel free to do so, but i'm otherwise i'm just going to call them the Ad supply in the morning, when I get in."
11942.0,Patient,"Do I take you back on what you just texted me Okay, do you need me yeah now I have limited availability outside of this."
165.0,Provider,"room so make sure you're always going through your normal avenues, if you have something, but like if you're in a bind and you have something really going on, like let me know okay. Because I mean holidays are hard enough like there's hard enough. You know what I mean and then having all the extra stuff on top of it um so i'm going to send yourself an email let her know what i'm doing, and then, if she has any big you know. Flags then she can throw them up before I go in the prescription tomorrow, otherwise i'll just call him that at supply for you do, you need anything else for me for."
11942.0,Patient,Tonight right now you're right my rest of my day up i'll tell.

165.0,Provider,"include that in the text message as well, so you don't. And you can call me anything as long as you don't call me late for dinner."
11942.0,Patient,tonight.
165.0,Provider,"Thank you so much. That was cheryl hardy engaged encounter at 1605 ended at 1620 Pacific standard time. patient is. She has roughly two and a half times remaining on hand right now. And she took her last dose today 1130 at roughly 2pm Pacific Eastern standard time. She denies withdrawals, and she denies relapses it sounds like this one that is going through a lot of really hard times just lost her son and now her mom went to. hospice today so i'm going to override the the prescription recommendation, but i'm also going to get the okay from Dr sell before I call it in tomorrow within the normal timeframe. It will be likely an eight day supply was your additional refills and no further action needed at this time. Patient was advised to address her her appointment reminders with the chess APP and compliance and she also will go to compliance tomorrow and reschedule her individual therapy. sounds like she has a pretty good treatment alliance, so not a whole lot of concerns for this patient other than just getting her hooked up and continuing on the program no further action needed."
