You know, and I hate, I mean I don't want it's not paul's fault. But. It was just living in that like that what the hell, am I going to do about the situation and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and. You know I mean nothing seen me talking to him about it didn't you know didn't seem to have any any kind of. impact on him. yeah it's like until until it kind of got like to crisis level like look. This is. really serious it's like he didn't hear me at all."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15994.0,Patient,"This counted that he's like i'll you know I know it's a problem but i'll i'll deal with it when i'm ready to deal with it. yeah you know and it's like Well, no, this is not okay. it's not just a problem for you it's problem for me and he was it's kind of you know, he he just didn't seem to relate that to the fact that me being in recovery because it's never impacted him before i've never you know i've never had a problem with Jim drinking with me being in recovery. And you never have a. problem with that, but he never drank to the access as he. As he down there you know it, as it just kept going up and up and up until it got to that level he just kept you know this isn't this isn't a problem, and you know and there's been a lot of our friends that have come to me and said, you know I think I have a drinking problem and. Then won't stop and I bought you know my husband here's the stuff I tell them it's like you know you have to just be an example you can't you can't make someone stops so you can stop. But you know I told him it's just I I was having a drunk roommate and I don't want to drink roommate. Again, to do it, you have to stop so I cannot drink. But it's just the tension and the you know the feeling like i'm walking around on eggshells was gone, you know, was to the roof here. yeah oh. And I just kept feeling like I was compromising myself, which was way different than saying you know stopped you know it's like okay now it's threatening our marriage. yeah you're drinking is gotten, to the point where it's it's out of control. yeah, and I mean you know him snore a you know just everything all the impacts on his health were causing so much."
759.0,Provider,Issues for him.
15994.0,Patient,"yeah for him and then then that you know, had for me so yeah you know. I think. You know something had to just that that. That have the plan just kept getting bigger and bigger and stretched out, it was just at that point where it's just going to explode and in this particular case, he finally got that okay it's like it's not okay anymore. Is not Okay, and he knew it wasn't Okay, but he just. didn't want to deal with it. You know, so I you know and i'm blessed that thankfully he chose to you know to work on that and work on our marriage which it's you know we're doing really good."
759.0,Provider,"that's good that's wonderful yeah. yeah yeah it took a while to get there, but you guys are finally there."

Having you thought more about that."
15994.0,Patient,"yeah I mean for right now, my main focus is just giving. As as this. wraps up with me being home and transition into going back to work, those are kind of just keeping keeping grounded. Okay, through this whole process. Because that's the biggest life. Change that's going to happen to me, and I know that I have to get back out there. So I think just. Making that transition and making it smoothly, without being stressed out and and getting these fears built up in my head. And when I talked to them when it like I said, for some, you know talking through them and just reminding myself to stay grounded and reminding myself. That you know that's, the main thing once I can TRAN I think that that's the biggest thing once I can transition into that you know getting back into into the working environment and make that make that transition."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15994.0,Patient,"That that's my main focus right now so that's, the main thing is just. Staying calm and getting through this this without losing you know, like you know, having a panic attack stressing myself out to the point I don't want to you know I don't want to I don't want to relapse. Thinking you know, stressing out about going going back into the work environment."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah i'd like to turn that to us grounded keeping yourself grounded.

759.0,Provider,yeah I.
15994.0,Patient,"mean I get I get I make things super huge and, especially, like in the middle of the night I wake up, I mean the hydroxyl really helps with that because I once I started taking that that really helped me from doing this. You know i'm one of those people i'd fall asleep, but then I wake up in the middle of the night and everything I was worried about would be like oh my God I gotta do this, and I still need to do that and I got. I got this I need to check that you know I just let my head run away with me and then I just have to constantly just. Take deep breaths it's okay take a step back."
759.0,Provider,"yeah I like the fact that you're doing a deep breathing the meditation all those things work well for you, you know. yeah you know mindfulness you know, which is a really big stuff and the medication and you know the other tool to help you as well."
15994.0,Patient,"yeah oh no absolutely I i'm not one of those people that don't think that I don't need medication, because I know that without it, I know where my head goes, I know what happens disco you know that there's a lot going on up there, and I stress myself out to panic attacks. And then. Once that's happening it's like. You know I just lose myself and then it's very simple to drink because that's the way you're you turn to when you're in crisis, you know when you're an alcoholic. that's your."
759.0,Provider,"that's all blood, but embracing those yeah and."
15994.0,Patient,"This will shut it all down, you know I mean it's I it's hard to explain to someone who hasn't had an you know I when I try and explain what alcohol is it's different than what people just take a SIP it's like this whole like a I always think of that pink floyd song comfortably numb. You know. This like you're just numb from head to toe. it's the you know it's always been I never drank for. You know I drank for the just that stop my head. You know from just it's like it was the only time when the stress would build up that I could just shut everything down. You know and. So it had nothing it's weird so it's like it's never been about craving alcohol. it's always been about. craving read, not even a craved but reaching that point where I let things build build build build build and then I just need something that's going to shut it all down. mm hmm you know, and for me it's always been alcohol. that's where I have to just keep telling myself and reminding myself that stay grounded and don't let yourself get there, so that I put myself in that position. yeah I need to be comfortably numb because no one can live their life comfortably numb."
759.0,Provider,"No, you can't. It doesn't help the situation doesn't make situations go away."

One step at a time, you know working to see myself it, you know, in that, in that moment, and you know just in something I can do in the future that now something that's going to make me happy. Because I. You know, and not stress me out so much. The main thing is I just I want that whatever I do next, I just want to be passionate about it.
