I just been getting really sick like it's just been frustrating like i'm after palm springs about a month ago I got really sick really, really sick and I think it's just like airplanes being I went to a nightclub all that stuff um and. So, then, I recovered from that and then um, I think, because I was like being sexually promiscuous I got stuck again um and. And I mean and I felt like knocked on my ass like I went to urgent care and thought I had like. A strep throat. And I got tested for like all the STDs and stress and everything and I didn't have any of that so I just had like a wicked sore throat um and then the day that went away, I will come with this eye infection."

148.0,Provider,"yeah that's I think of response to what your body feeling right now right I. mean that if you are feeling. Not 100% right and feeling a little bit under the weather, and you have things that are coming up it's important to listen to your body. And you know that once you get better and all these issues are these physical issues are resolved that's when you can say okay now it's my time to get active and get you know."
16117.0,Patient,there's yeah.
148.0,Provider,But right now I think it's really important to listen to your body.
16117.0,Patient,"yeah I really didn't need sleep. yeah yeah, so I think i'm gonna i'm I think i'm going to like. Take some sick time off of work because i've been like kind of like half in half out. um so I need to take some sick time and also I just I need to reply to this dmv things super quickly. i'm sorry about this.

16117.0,Patient,"Thank you i'm so excited I mean i'm like paying for it partially um but i'm getting it for about like half of i'm buying it for like about half of what it's worth. So i'm buying it for 7000 and it's like definitely worth like at least 14 15,000. if not more so um yeah i'm like yeah i'm very, very, very happy, and I mean the only reason i'm getting a car is because. I found out from my landlord that they did have a parking garage available for me in San Francisco which is like the what like wildest dream come true of like having like a you know rent controlled apartment with a garage to park Alexis and you know i've got my dog and. You know i've got my space and i've got my job and i've got the park and yeah I mean ever since like I accepted God into my heart, a couple months ago, just getting."

148.0,Provider,wow that's so huge yeah and I think that I can hear a lot more stability in you. Since you've put the alcohol down mm.
16117.0,Patient,that's great that's great.
148.0,Provider,yeah we basis. Can we just take a moment to say wow. yeah graduation.
16117.0,Patient,"That is yeah Thank you so much, and like this week I feel more like open to like receiving not a little bit. Because like it's taking a lot of. it's taken a lot of like faith to like stick to the plan. it's taking a lot of faith. That like life will work out and be you know, interesting and meaningful and kind of worth it um. and So yeah um it just it just is a."
148.0,Provider,I really hear you. For you yeah. In your process.
16117.0,Patient,"yeah i'm trusting it more, and I mean I think like that's I mean so. I. I actually um many months ago had signed up for a guided ketamine therapy. experience. And I met with a psychiatrist who like reviewed my char and all that stuff and so that i'd be a candidate for like treatment resistant depression. And ketamine therapy and I talked about it with my sponsor and like got his blessing. And so after like kind of months of preparing for this event. I actually did my my ketamine journey yesterday um and like I actually had another alcoholic like guide me through it um and so that was really powerful um so I got to kind of like bond with him and then I went like through the experience and and I got a lot of insight. And I got a lot of messages."
148.0,Provider,"walk me through this little bit, I know that ketamine was approved for treating depression, but I don't know what the process looks like."
16117.0,Patient,"yeah so basically I, so I do through the service called mine mind bloom which you can look up it's a virtual um it's a virtual like psychiatry kind of like treatment um thing and they specialize in ketamine therapy. And so you know back months ago, even before bright heart, I was so desperate to. Just like leave no stone unturned that like I. I signed up for the service and then I started bright heart and then I got approved by a psychiatrist from mine bloom to do the treatment um and. But day, so they sent me ketamine and I actually like sat on it for a month and, just like thought about it before doing it because, like you know ketamine is like. it's like a controlled substance and I felt really conflicted about like working on sobriety and then also like. Trying this like type of like you know mind altering therapy, while I was like also trying to like work on my sobriety so like. I basically like had my ketamine sitting in a corner of my house for like a month and I just like pretty much just it I just had kind of out of sight out of mind um. Until I could get a little bit more stable and then um so once I felt kind of like ready basically like this is, this is the process, so what you do is you, you take a dose of ketamine. And for me I just did it like sublingual Lee. And what you do is like you set an intention with a guide before the experience and so, for me, I like set the intention of like wanting to cultivate more self love. Wanting to let go of the past, a little bit um because, like that's that is really hard for me to do is kind of like let go of the regrets and just like. take a deep breath like live in the present, so I wanted to work on that, and then I also really wanted to work on kind of like. Accessing a little bit more of like a higher power because, like i've tried to really incorporate that until like a. So i'm like I want to understand like if there's something within me that can kind of feel a bit of a like a higher power and so basically what my experience was like experiences can like really very. um very differently, like across different people and different brain chemistry, but basically what happened for me was I was, I was pretty consciously aware actually the whole entire time so. I was in a state of being tranquilized um and. kind of like dissociated a little bit. And I entered a state of like. I guess like relaxation and deep contemplation and. Then I started going deeper into that states and my and then things things started coming up like emotion started coming up. So the first emotion that came up was like anger and frustration, because i've been so frustrated by like feeling like I don't have access to my spirituality and God. um you know that i've been na and like I haven't felt connected to a higher power, and so I was just like kept asking like you know. what's the point of all this, like like you know why, like Why am I on this planet and why are we all here, and you know, like is God even real like, and you know really questioning a lot of things and just basically like kind of like metaphorically shaking my fist of the sky, so to speak. And then I got like a huge amount of emotions like up into my heart and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere I started like bursting into tears. Like just like he doing he leaving and it almost felt like vomiting or purging and um. And I was almost like consciously aware of like there was like there was a window open for me to like get this stuff out. And so I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing. And I know this is a graphic but like I don't know if you've ever like well, I mean i'm sure you have, but like. When you throw up sometimes there's that moment of like you could either kind of like try and catch your breath, or like trying to like let more out. And like for me like it was like more like sobbing but, like, I was trying to let out as much as I could, because I was like. Like here's my window to like let all this out, you know in this state, so I kept, just like pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing and sobbing and sobbing and sobbing um and then I kind of like calm down a little bit. And then I got some I got some decisions about like some things that I think my body wants me to do i'm to like he'll um and one of those things is wander. that's the biggest thing that, like my body and mind wants to do. Like my body mind, they just want me to go out into nature and squander that's all they want like that's that was like the message I received was like just go wander just like be a wandering spirit out in the forest just take myself out. And just. And just explore and wander and just be a spirit and just be a spirit to all that I encounter and just you know be my spirit just be. Who I am with no mask to like all that I encounter and just go, just like just go walk around just go beyond the world go wander around, and so I received this like instruction. Not to wander and so that's what i'm going to try and do is i'm going to try and like go out into the woods more gone more hikes going explored. i'm thousand thing I also got to see like my inner addict i'm who's very, very skinny and it like kind of manifested as like. Someone from like a previous life it felt like I was looking at like my previous life, where. I got this message like this is what you were in your previous life, even though i'm not even really sure I believe in that, but like that's how it came up. And it was a very, very sick skinny person and I almost feel like that's why eat so much is like it made sense to me, I was like oh like this is why eat so much is because, like. I feel like I feel sick like and I and i'm like filling myself with food almost like as if I was starving. um so that came up and then the most surprising thing honestly was um I also kind of like realized that like I can never forgive myself for being the person I am unless I forgive my parents. And this was the first time, and all of that anger that I was like the first time that I thought in my life like maybe I could actually forgive my dad. wow so a lot happened and basically like this it manifested as like. This uncontrollable crying and then kind of these like these, like little images messages nothing like nothing like super psychedelic like it wasn't out of control, I wasn't like like I was there was a part of me that was very consciously aware like I was watching the movie almost. And it was it was very consciously aware. And then I woke up and the ketamine totally faded, and I was just like back to myself and then I was just here like I was just like totally back to normal um and yeah, then I like I like ate some ice cream watching TV what a like drove my car around and um. and had a great time like it was great."
148.0,Provider,You did this yesterday. It sounds like it was a really healing experience for you.
16117.0,Patient,"yeah it was, it was because i'm i've needed a lot of help lately with like trying to access like what it is like my heart truly wants."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
16117.0,Patient,"You know i've had trouble figuring that out. And i've started to realize like there's a lot about myself that I don't know. I thought I had myself figured out and like now i'm realizing like I really don't like i'm surprising myself every day with some of the things I think and do and say feel like I. yeah I think I know, like the tip of the iceberg of myself. So."
148.0,Provider,And because you're sober now.
16117.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"Very different version of you that you're learning for. Would you say, the first time."
16117.0,Patient,"yeah because the last time I got sober. It was very, to be honest with you, it was very much ego driven. in the sense that it was like i'm going to be silver to prove that I can do it. And i'm going to lose all this way to. Prove I can do it. And i'm gonna you know run this marathon and get this job and. Get the boyfriend and have the sex and blah blah blah, and it was all I feel like it was a lot of like ego ego ego and it was like an amazing learning experience, but like. There wasn't the level of like acceptance, I have now I was like I. If the like construct of an addict and an alcoholic or a real thing then like I am that right like you know, regardless of what it's called in the DSM or what it's called him, like the rooms of a like whatever that is like I am that and like I didn't accept that before truly. And even now my ego comes up and will say you know through so many times, where you had a couple drinks and it was totally fine you know that's what my ego will kind of come up and say to me."
148.0,Provider,I almost want to name that as your addiction.
16117.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,"I think they're important to recognize. That, as your addiction manipulate you and addiction is a very deceptive disease right so."
16117.0,Patient,When those.
148.0,Provider,"ma I want you to reframe them into sober one so like that's one of your addictive thoughts, you know which those will come up right. you're human and this is something that you struggle with those addictive thoughts are going to come up and that's what it could sound like i'm like. Well, you know even after you build a lot of time in your recovery, you can have just one it won't hurt you now you're doing so good right, those are."
16117.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,"yeah or were you were able to control, you can control it now, those are addictive."
16117.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. And I also think that, like. i've been so I was so hung up on like. Comparing what was different about my drinking, this is, and this is something I hear in speaker tapes because i've been i've been consuming a very large amount of alcohol Thomas. tapes i'm from conventions and stuff like that, like, I honestly it's like very keeling to me it's like one of the biggest part of my recoveries is speaker tapes. Honestly, they are as important to me as meetings like anytime i'm cleaning the House or taking a shower or. walking banjo it's like i've got i've got an alcoholic in my ear like experiencing you know sharing their experience strength and hope you know um and so um. You know a lot of sometimes what they'll say in their recovery was like they were looking for the differences. And I think when I first tried to get sober I was looking for the differences between my recovery and alcoholics anonymous. Because I didn't want to be that I didn't I wanted to be better than an alcoholic. yeah. And I wasn't I, and I. I think I was in denial, you know. um. You know I and and it's taken a lot of like here it's taken a lot of i'm not necessarily humility, because I, I have known that i've been i've i've known that i'm different than most people in this respect i've known that for a long time, but. um. it's taken the biggest thing is taken courage. To like really actually take the path that I need to take. because that means admitting that you the group of alcoholics that you that I meet with like I am them and they are me like it takes admitting that and like seeing people suffering with addiction on the streets of San Francisco and looking at them and thinking like we're not so different. You know and and taking the courage to say like. You know it doesn't matter what it's called anymore i'm like i'm an addict i'm an alcoholic i'm whatever it is that. Is that you know and that's that's just it's just what it's just what i'm learning in this lifetime, you know and that's been the scariest thing is to like do is surrender is the surrender. surrender piece of it that's the word that comes to mind, so I remember, two years ago I would hear the word surrender and i'll say."
148.0,Provider,yeah that's the word.
16117.0,Patient,That came.
148.0,Provider,"To my mind, you I almost hear that in in your surrendering your your free like I hear that you're doing so empowered by this right like this is, who I am, this is what i've struggled with and just the acceptance around that is so huge and every day that. you're sober. you're choosing courage over comfort."
16117.0,Patient,"it's hard like I mean. There are days, I want to check out. ya know dark days, where like. I just don't want to I just don't want to be me, I want to take a break from being sneaky you know."
148.0,Provider,And that's. that's you with alcohol.
16117.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, and I mean many, many different things, I mean alcohol definitely drugs to. Drugs for."
148.0,Provider,You to check out and to numb and escape the reality.
16117.0,Patient,"yeah you know I would I would be so high on speed that my boyfriend would come over, and I would feel nothing for him. Not even like like it was just like I was just like I just wanted him to go away."
148.0,Provider,That could be because you had a deeper connection with your set with the substance than you did.
16117.0,Patient,"yeah. You being exactly yeah and I remember like that was scary of like cuz I I had this little piece of consciousness still still there thinking. Why do I want him to just leave, so I can buy alcohol and take drugs. Like I remember thinking like. that's a little weird that i'd rather hang out by myself with a bottle of wine and a bottle of at all like. I remember thinking like oh Okay, this is like wow I really, this is a new it felt like a new like Oh, this is a new one, like this is a new um darkness that I have not experienced yet. And yeah I mean even I mean it's it's really like i'm really seduced i'm really seduced by drugs and alcohol like i'm very seduced by it i'm very seduced by i'm taking a break clock I mean clocking out. No that's my. um. And so I think I need to know, I think I need to like be more gentle with myself and like take you know and honestly like just take more breaks throughout the day, where I lie down like I was like a couple days ago, like I just laid down for a while it's like. Take a break, take a break, you know because because my foot on the gas like my ego my addict side, you know that part of me that's trying to drive the car so tightly. is exhausted, and like. You know."
148.0,Provider,"So coming out physically right now, like you're exhausted."
16117.0,Patient,i'm sick physically sick. that's so sad.
148.0,Provider,"yeah so. It makes a lot of sense right as we're either all or nothing right. In a SEC Oh, giving yourself permission to slow down and relax and take breaks that might feel uncomfortable for you. Because in the back your mind the the addictive part of you is saying well, what are you doing for your recovery, what do you need to get done what, what do you need right all. yeah that's like just our brain going going going going but it's important to take a step back when it's. That intense. And allow yourself permission, because you deserve breaks, you deserve timeout to deserve to just be just be with your breath."
16117.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah. And then the other thing was you know my sponsor told me like that's when you need to like share at meetings and I did share last night and like it did help like it really did help like I felt like I got I was able to like get some of the pressure out of the pot, like, I was able to. get some of it out by sharing. um so. That was that was really helpful. And I didn't I didn't really think. I didn't really think when my sponsor told him to do that. That like sharing and a meeting was was going to be. relieving, but it was relieving it was relieving and that's what a lot of people in a say, like they say you know, like you'll get you'll get relief in meetings like if you go and you share that's why people go every day. Yes, because, like they need that every 24 hours like they need that release. You know. So Oh, I have to let in mail person real quick one second i'm still on audio, though. um yeah sorry about that I. Let them in um. yeah so um. Anyway, um yeah so that's kind of like the main updates and I think I just got to kind of talk to. My interim manager at work that i'm like this, this quarter just might not be quite as astoundingly productive just because, like I need to tell them like look I feel like i've been sick for like a month like I just feel like i've been really like unwell like. And it's it's been it's been weird to like be spiritually growing, but then like physically ill."
148.0,Provider,You. Know right now.
16117.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
148.0,Provider,What physical symptoms.
16117.0,Patient,"Well i've been i've been getting like actually sick more often like i've been getting like more colds. Like i've been getting cold sore throat and then obviously i've got this like I infection now um but you know I mean it also I think it's like because, like I. You know i've been i've not been like feeding myself good food like i'm not been feeding myself like plants and fresh foods and like vitamin rich stuff and like. You know and and I do, I do have weight to lose in order to like be healthy and so like I like part of that is like. You know, except where I am with my body, so that i'm not being self hating right and and but at the same time, like in you know, one of the other things that came up for me was like I want to eat more plants. You know that came up for me in my in my journey into my subconscious sub conscience, you know that came up was like I want to eat more plants. And I I mean I really you know it's it's all kind of connected in a way, and like I know like you know. If i'm eating a lot of green and meeting a lot of plants and i'm eating eating some fruit and and getting outside like those things like. Like you know right now i've got all this food that's like not healthy for me and it's like it's in my body, you know and it's not my body's not flowing. I also haven't been exercising i've been doing yoga so my lymphatic system has been stagnant, you know my lymphatic system means movement in order to circulate throughout the body, it doesn't even pump itself so like the only way to move your lymph fluids, is to move. So i'm like. Honestly, like yoga is probably not going to like big it's not going to cure my cold all the time, like. it's probably going to help like it's probably going to put my lymph nodes in a better place so anyway. But i'm but i'm also so tired it's like how do I start doing this yoga like treating myself better and feeding myself when like i'm so tired and I also have this dog that i've not been training well and so i'm still fucking so overwhelmed you know. Oh. And this is why you should drink, because this overwhelm."
148.0,Provider,yeah stress.
16117.0,Patient,yeah yeah stress.
148.0,Provider,"yeah I want you to be really aware of that stress that you're feeling and how. to manage it, and really listen to your body, right now, like, I know I hear all the things that you want to do, but I think it's important to meet yourself where you're at right you're still doing a lot of work."
16117.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,"But for him to listen to your body, so your body can physically heal your brain is doing so much healing right now, your mind is doing so much healing emotionally you're doing so much healing I get I understand why you're tired."
16117.0,Patient,yeah I haven't really tired yeah i'm really tired.
148.0,Provider,yeah don't. know how much work you are doing the physical stuff can come later when you feel. You know you're becoming more stable in your recovery every day now.
16117.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,But you're still very fragile.
16117.0,Patient,mmm hmm.
148.0,Provider,"yeah. I wanna say I hear a huge shift today in our session, and you, you have i've really enjoyed listening to your focus on yourself today I haven't heard you talk about your family once. hmm there's been a huge emphasis on you today on the things that you're working on on your acceptance on your spirituality i'm. Really it's been really good to hear you today. Coming out. To hear you yeah I feel like there has been a breakthrough."
16117.0,Patient,"mm hmm mm hmm yeah well, I think, like. One thing apparently that sometimes like a like a guided ketamine experience can do is the the drug itself apparently has the power to like reignite neuro transmitters that have fallen dormant in depression. and There is a state of like much greater and neuro plasticity that happens after the ketamine I you know if we're talking about like medically so like right now my brain today. could even theoretically be experiencing certain certain weaklings or certain neurotransmitters that I haven't felt in a while. Plus going to a last night, right after the experience when i'm in a heightened state of neural plasticity. um I saw an old friend, I saw best friend from high school um. You know, who I grew up with and and has always been a positive influence in my life, and so you know I mean all these things coming together like it's. Really stunning, and you know, like a couple years ago, I said that my dream car was a used lexus my dream car was a sensible use x's and I haven't even like process, the fact that, like. In. Three weeks of sobriety i've gotten muscle car in a garage for it, I was able to show up for my best friend from my childhood. sober. and host her um and. You know, I was able to be sober through the holidays, with my family. and Like and then I was able to have this like experience of like track of like being able to just look into my subconscious lizard brain more. and see like what's going on there, and like I think that's what the ketamine helps with a little bit it's like it helps you see oh like what's going on in your amygdala um. And so, like it's something I definitely want to keep in my toolkit of like maybe once every six weeks eight weeks, you know going through a guided experience, because I mean it really is it's like a check in with your own brain where you're like Oh, this is this is kind of and. yeah I mean I like. I guess I don't know I mean I don't know what it was about doing that experience that made me realize that like if I hate my dad like I can never I can never fully love myself because i'm holding him to a standard that he would never be able to meet. And that is going to and that's that will also bleed into me holding myself to standards, I can't meet. angry, you know, like yeah he I mean he was he was emotionally abusive and I think like sometimes when. We say like. You know the recovery is isn't or like the abuse isn't your fault, but like the healing is your responsibility that always that always used to make me mad actually like you know, like because I felt like it was unfair."
148.0,Provider,There yeah.
16117.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm thinking like, if I can release, if I can forgive him for his abuse of like you know what like you hurt me you made me feel so scared and small and frightened and insecure um. But like. Your dad abused you. And he was an alcoholic and he passed that to you and you pass that to me, and you were in traffic everyday driving to and from Detroit to a job you didn't like to put food on the table and the way it came out was rage. And it's like. Okay, like, I was fucked up. But like. I mean. Here we are like, here we are, this is now. You know, here we are, here we are, like he wants to have a relationship with me like he calls me he texts me he wants to be involved in my life, you know, in a way, in a way that you can so it's like. You know well, I mean I can go home for Christmas and like I can go smile to him and hug him and like treat him with love, even though, like there's you know I can I can put more love into the world. i'm."
148.0,Provider,"Here, new new understanding a deeper understanding than I have ever heard in you."
16117.0,Patient,"Well, this is the first time i've thought about forgiving him."
148.0,Provider,Is.
16117.0,Patient,"i've never been there. That is never been there. Progress yeah. yeah I don't know what it was about maybe or maybe it was just a culmination of many different factors um. You know, maybe it was part of the setting the intentions and and deeply meditating yesterday and getting some of those messages i'm able to I mean I think like seeing speakers and seeing how they have turned their lives around and thinking about my dad and thinking like. You know I would want my dad to be able to walk into the halls of a and tell people what he's done. And then have everyone I say keep coming back.
