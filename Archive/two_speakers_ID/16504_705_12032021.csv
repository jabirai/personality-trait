16504.0,Patient,"Yes, so they're going to rebuild it right now we finally got someone to come and remove this busters and that was what we were waiting for to get it cleared out was to get that cleared first. it's such an old bar, it was it's over 100 years old, it was his dad reno's before it was his so you know there's a lot of history there and such old buildings, you know kind of call for more measurements so we're looking at like. Maybe like 10 to 12 months total before we can actually rebuild it and get it back open and running but that's what they came up with the agreement to pay me. You know 600 every week and hope subtle stay, you know, regardless if I really work or not, or just do ordinary jobs and stuff but they want me to stay because I was a bartender the cook waitress like I worked there all day from. midnight around the place yep."

You know something like sometimes i'm on comes over and we play out the. lottery tickets, you know. You buy like a couple lottery tickets and whoever wins gets it so you know just stuff like that, like, I really enjoy staying home my mom so she comes over her a lot, now that my husband's working a lot and working nights so i'm not by myself, you know. Oh she's my safe haven."
705.0,Provider,"And then it, you know you have things you have hobbies you have things of interest that you're doing like you said fishing or playing you know board games with your mom how about the."

No. No, he says yes or no. No know. Listen. No it's not.

705.0,Provider,"it's a hard decision to, because then, in the event that he has really sick, but then you know how kids don't like it."
16504.0,Patient,"I kind of have a little cough right now i'm just a little one you know, but I always get it like at least some time of the year and then smoking doesn't help, but I noticed, he has it too, and the thing right now with Cobra is if the kids slightly coughing they get sent home so. You know I told the school like he's kind of coughing so we did a rapid test for him he's a negative, which I knew he was he doesn't have any other symptoms that that cloth. And then to this morning he was really coughing a lot so. You know he has asthma, so I basically like just kind of cut them off for that reason, but then you know when you first wake up it's always when it's the warriors. And then it kind of gets better and that's kind of what happened, so you know, Michael you didn't need to stay home without I did you. let it happen."
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad that you err on the side of caution, you took care of him, and then now tomorrow it's like okay one more day of school you're back."
16504.0,Patient,"When my husband he gets so mad when I do stuff like this he's like jealous of my kid I don't know if that makes sense, but."
705.0,Provider,jealous of the time and then tinge.
16504.0,Patient,"Like today, you know he's like I didn't know when I signed up to be with you or. to marry you to be here. You know Jason dad that it'd be like this forever, but then again and never been around a kid at ADHD you know, he says stuff like that to me and it just like. Like you know, like kills me inside it's like what am I supposed to do, like but i've learned like being growing up and stop please, no, no, no. No go i'm not telling you again. Like growing up with like my step dad like abusing my mom and she had to like listen to what he said and then my boss is kind of the same way and then now he's like that it's like I kind of just bow my head down and say okay to whatever they say you know but deep down, and just like. So, like, I feel bad that like I feel like my son i'm not even joking with you dude like. Pushing my button so bad right now. But I feel bad for him because, like I know my son fils the secondary love that my husband gives him so then like I try to baby him and spend time with them, but then he does stuff like this and it just makes me so like stressed out."
705.0,Provider,"And then, with the ADHD to sometimes it's hard, because his his focus in its attention span and learning how Okay, you know and trying to gauge like what's a different technique that may work tonight may not work tomorrow."
16504.0,Patient,"yeah we'll see because he's been inside all day I get it like he go stir crazy. he's such a social butterfly who loves to be outside. Now, but since he was sick I said you don't need a thought side you don't need to do any of that stuff and so now it's coming to the point where he's like. You know, like my husband just left for work, maybe like two hours ago, and so he wants my attention. In the room with him and because i'm out here, you know doing something right it's like you know he's just going crazy now, but after after a little while to fixate on something else and forget about it. Okay So hopefully he'll leave me alone for a little while. Longer finishes."
705.0,Provider,"If not. we'll take it, you know, however, if he comes back if it gets too much can just let me know."
16504.0,Patient,"I actually called my mom. Before the start and asked her if she can come over she was at her mother in law's house, but she said, afterwards, she would so i'm hoping that, when she gets her, she can take them inside and that way you know. really just I had that plan for this, so I wouldn't get interrupted but she's not here yet."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you know, sometimes JESSICA, you can only do so much and you're doing your best, and you know, the same thing with with your husband and it's like that that having to choose, it sounds like you know kind of where do you give attention, while the child is seven."
16504.0,Patient,"Well, like he's my world is Jen it's been just me and him his dad is in and out of prison on drugs, you know abusive and stuff and I only put up with that for like four years of being with him and then. split up with them and then like four years later I meet him, you know and so he's been in our lives for almost three years now, Victor my current husband and. You know, like, I mean I appreciate him so much, but at the same time to it's like he's so picky and whining complaining like complaining all the time and. bitches about everything, and like to me it's like pick and choose dude like everything pisses you off like everything does you know, like this morning he made a comment like i'd rather be at work and be here with you isn't that sad and I was like whatever dude so like. between both of them stresses me out, and so it kind of falls back on why I kind of did what I did, please stop look norco because it helped just to be. High and then deal with everything at once, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah take the edge off escape for a moment and all of. yeah and that's where you know. i'm glad JESSICA that you're getting this out of Okay, what is it because those things you know may take time, like there's things you could you and I can work on when we meet individually, you know we can do. Like assertive skills are things that you know where you're able to have some more outlets and one of them, you know, sometimes it's just taken in a deep breath, have you done any breathing techniques before."
16504.0,Patient,"No really I mean when I have a panic attack, I agree."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16504.0,Patient,"Like I tried to like. You know breathing and stuff like that, but so I don't hyperventilate but. I don't think i've ever really done breathing techniques."

16504.0,Patient,It out right now. To my hand and i'm like. I don't want to be rude and just. known and then.
705.0,Provider,"Thank you, thank you for asking, but no i'm okay an individual if you may be working with someone else, maybe they'll be different, but thank you for asking. With the breathing to you know we'll go through some of those techniques for you know, to give you some of those outlets. And to have some escape, and you know, sometimes it's just trying out different things like even writing down some of those things that that were shared. That he said to be able to kind of you, and I can work on picking That apart, and just Okay, sometimes it's prioritizing to like what do you care about and what other stuff, are you willing to let it go. And stuff that you want to you know work on it's like Okay, this is, this is something so was it prior to your your marriage now you were married before and there was domestic violence."
16504.0,Patient,"not really sure I wasn't married to him, but um yeah there was domestic violence, he was. A very abusive drug addicts just."
705.0,Provider,How long.
16504.0,Patient,Everything my step dad was what I. got with which is crazy.
705.0,Provider,"Sometimes JESSICA, when you grow up around that even though you're like i'll never date that it becomes because that was your normal. When you were growing up it's like you know that's what you know now it's like okay learning that no it doesn't have to be this way it can be different and good for you, for getting out of the relationship."
16504.0,Patient,"Like a lot, but I did now, and he just got out of prison. Like five months ago and stuff and started trying to come around my son, and you know and he's he was locked out for four years, so and not the dylan for a while. Now he's came back and stuff like that, like he I mean he doesn't bother me too much I haven't blocked and stuff and. He has a new girlfriend and you know stuff so he leaves me alone, a little bit, but like still will pass by, and honk the Horn, or like wrote on the back of my car on the dirt on the window like I heart manual and i'm like oh my gosh like stupid shit but."
705.0,Provider,yeah you're like I don't need this right.
16504.0,Patient,"yeah at all at all at all and he's already wanted again so. You know I saw him at the grocery store, the other day and I called it in because he has wanted again, and I should have to put up with that, and you know and go back to Joe for all I care."
705.0,Provider,You mentioned your stepfather that when you were growing up your main caretakers.
16504.0,Patient,"well. When I was three my mom split up with my biological father. which he said, if he couldn't have us all the time you didn't want us at all, it was me my tears above me my sister rianna tears above her my my brother Eric. And we got with my step dad which we were very, very well known as a stepchildren it was never like I called him dad it was always Chris. You know, like type of thing and bare minimum, like his family, you know just didn't care for us and didn't like my mom because she had three kids and you know there were she was in a ruin my step dad's life blah blah blah, and then, when I was six. My biological Father chopped his dad's head off with the machete and he went to an insane asylum. And they claimed to be. Like crazy. And he got away with a basically because when I was 14 he lived in the Tower district and fresno in like a halfway house and I met him for the first time since I was three. which she was crazy I, which I have never met him again because i've met him one time just you know with my siblings and i've never wanted to see him again he's no. But um my step dad and my mom are the ones who raised us like all my life and they're still together now, but they were both drug addicts as well. My mom went to jail for like two years I lived with my grandma and you know my step dad would beat the crap out on my mom is like he's locks in the garage at night time if we're being loud, or you know, like we knew better than to. Make noise or like we had to sit at the table and eat everything until it was done and, like several this day like. I hate me so much because of that, because, like one time, like, I was the last one there. And my mom couldn't save us because she get beat up and we knew it so we never looked to her for help and like. I was the last one there, and my brother my sister like dude just eat it's not that bad i'm like but I don't want it. So he comes up to me after like two hours of sitting there, and like start shoveling the meatloaf in my mouth. and gross me out I started like throwing it up, but he started shoveling that that in my mouth too and there's just the worst thing I said was a date on below like I won't even go near it."
705.0,Provider,I can understand why it's like yeah. yeah probably yeah. yeah and you know with trauma like that you can still take in like the smell the memory everything.
16504.0,Patient,"Closed they made it up the bar one time, like I literally started crying outside like and I was like I cannot fucking i'm not working so, then I left. Alex you don't like it then fire me because I will not be here while you're serving it like I don't want to smell it I don't want to do the dishes afterwards I don't want to serve it to people like. You know, when that people kept making fun of me like little meatloaf and like put it in my face and i'm like like it just pissed me off like. guys don't get it like. Fuck that looks like that."
705.0,Provider,yeah that lack of understanding that sound the same honor your husband to that there's a level of lack of understanding of the relationship with you and your son and how that plays a part of how you know with you and the things that with it within your relationship so.
16504.0,Patient,"You know my husband says to us like why the Fuck do you make the kid a separate mill like you should be eating what we're eating i'm like he's tried it before he doesn't like it i'm not going to make him eat it because it was resorts back to how I felt. You know so i'm like i'm not gonna let him eat it or like you know, he was like telling me today that no more fundraisers like it's just too much work and my son, should be the one doing it not me, but my mom never did fundraisers for me. So that's why I like to do them with my son. You know, but he doesn't see that he just sees that i'm just doing everything for him and he gets whatever he wants and blah blah blah, you know, like in all reality there's a reason behind why i'm doing everything that I do."
705.0,Provider,Right.
16504.0,Patient,"You know, like my son doesn't want to eat it i'm not going to make me that i'm not going to be like they were. You know. Second, maybe spoil to an extent, but you know, like. It just It makes sense in my head."
705.0,Provider,Well you're breaking the cycle you're breaking the cycle of abuse was there than was their physical abuse.
16504.0,Patient,yeah inquiries they're like well get hit. In the garage duct tape. Is. verbal abuse emotional abuse.
705.0,Provider,mental abuse.
16504.0,Patient,"is not like that anymore like. I remember, like every morning when he got up, he said, if I have to get up all you have to get up and you'd open everyone's looking door and turn the lights on and I thought I got smart and I and twisted the light bulb so when you try to turn the light on in the morning. You know, but wouldn't turn on and he cut the power to my room for like a month, you know cuz for being a smart ass and doing that, or like. You know just just would be a complete prick you know, like from the middle of the night like he'd wake everybody up screaming and yelling like beating the shit out of my mom like carrying her scream bloody murder and. I remember one time, like, I even got up and I was fighting with him because he was beating my mom and my mom ran to the bathroom and he tried to bust, the door and I had made and I was like in high school and I may see them in the face. with it. And that's when I was like 16 and that's when I moved out. And lived with a friend and got my first job at kfc working, and you know and i've been on my own, since then, because you know, like i've learned like. No one in this world is going to help you but yourself, you know and so and it's from that day, but I mean we're we're okay now like he doesn't do drugs anymore neither my parents do and they're like they're like different people now they're amazing grandparents are just shitty as parents. You know I love them now."
705.0,Provider,"You forgiven but you haven't forgotten and it's all like lesson in print on how you navigate through the world today. Was there. I was just going to see to are you still in a private area. yeah okay. Okay. Is there ever any sexual abuse Okay, did you ever receive any counseling for."
16504.0,Patient,"I went to therapy. Through a Gal here and Caribbean. For a while to me and my son went to her and she was Okay, she was just really hard to get into here like really, really hard you know and so like. By the time that month came on just like Fuck it I don't need it anymore like i'm already out of that like I feel like I need help state of mind and so like I just kind of like dropped it after a couple times but um. yeah never been to therapy other other any other way, though."
705.0,Provider,"What would you and I can do is you, and I will work on because i'm a licensed events alcohol and drug counselor, and so we can work on coping skills, we can work on things that relate back to recovery. And then, once you get those coping skills and you're in group you're attending, then you can see where you are and and, if you would like we have someone with a right heart health team that's really good and those MB m. E m Dr after like spell it out and it's a tapping techniques that help it doesn't help like remove the trauma, but it helps less than the trauma around it. And it. yeah so if that's something that you're interested in JESSICA, is that something, you know that usually we work together first and then I would make that. they'll do an assessment and then see you know if that's something that you want to do. just keep it in mind, because you know it can offer some relief like you were talking about the meatloaf incident and that's what I was thinking. Just that event alone, you have so many things, you know that you're still recalling it could help with that, so it wouldn't take it away, but it could lessen were maybe would be in the room, maybe you could tolerate some of the stuff you haven't been able to before. It is techniques that a lot of times people people won't even know what you're doing. yeah yeah yeah so good so i'm glad that you're open for that later on within for mom and biological dad and your mom.

And then got a hold of bright heart, and through you guys and then. yeah still did it until because it took me like two weeks or three weeks to get Ahold of Dr a so I kind of still did it until the day that she finally saw me and we talked and she prescribed me suboxone I got sober and started taking it."
