748.0,Provider,"And I especially want to know how you are today, so I love them history but, but I want to Center for you want to start."
12336.0,Patient,"Okay i'm today i'm it's funny and tired today and i'm normally not tired um but i've been really busy so it's a good tired oh. um yeah I haven't I haven't hike I was thinking, the other day, like I can't even I couldn't even tell you the last time I had a nap in the daytime and I used to nap when I when my husband was alive. It was so stressful in my house that I napped every day, like, I was always tired and i'm not tired anymore. at all, and I was taking the adderall before too so it's not the adderall um yeah it's a good thing, though, it feels good to not be tired, I felt like I was living like in a cloud for so long before he died. But yeah so i've got a new bed, which is great. Considering he died in the old one, so. I know yeah the girlfriend bought me a new bed, and it just came last week and so that's Nice and i've. Spent like he died almost six months ago March, April May, June, July August September, October oh yeah just six months ago and i'm glad I didn't know that I mean I didn't remember it on the day um. So before he died, he has had three sons and oh no I don't wanna cry and work wait sorry."
748.0,Provider,No don't stop yourself from crying release.
12336.0,Patient,"That, I know, but then I guess um anyway, so there were, I met, I met him 10 years ago my husband and. He his wife had just left him when I met him and I met him through his best friend who was a friend of mine but we knew the guy in two totally different ways, because. They knew the guy because he went to high school with him and his ex wife torsten my husband he Robbie went to school with them and then I lived in downtown la because I was going through a divorce and. I worked in the entertainment industry and he. He did too, and so I knew him he's gay and I knew him like hub, but torsten he had never come out to torsten we're talking like this is 10 years ago we were in our 40s he's totally come out since it was just bizarre because we knew that the same person totally different ways. yeah so anyway, so he introduced us and. I fell in love with his little boys, because they were like, six, seven and nine and I had never had kids and they were just so cute and they were just so scared we loved them so much and um. Anyway, I didn't even want to be with him, I was just finishing up with this divorce and I just wanted to be alone by one of those little kids and so anyway, I I stayed with them and then. yeah whatever now they're all done. Now i'm trying to figure out what i'm supposed to do for the rest of my life."
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely, so the date be 1617 and 19."
12336.0,Patient,"yeah no 1618 and 21 he just turned 21 on Sunday and I went to it was the first time in 10 years that. His mother and their stepmother me and their paternal grandparents my in laws correction laws we all had lunch together, and it was really weird but good for the boys."
748.0,Provider,yeah.
12336.0,Patient,Oh man I didn't think I was gonna call this sucks.
748.0,Provider,And it sucks because.
12336.0,Patient,"Oh just get taller. it's gross. And if I don't that I don't get depressed as much. let's just pop. it's. it's tough that I. I totally left. The field, I was in which I can't get back into, and I mean it could, but I don't want to and. I bought this House for them, because it was by his kids school I live. Like 30 minutes from here. And now i'm stuck here well not really I could sell it, but I know where I want to go. Like I could I could go somewhere, but I don't want to go anywhere right now."
748.0,Provider,"No it's really soon. it's really soon. So were you and your husband close. Okay, I don't know your history so."
12336.0,Patient,"He we were very close actually we weren't legally married because. He had a lot of financial problems, a lot, so we couldn't get married or right now it's weird because you know how you go through life with intuition. I never I never knew he was going to die that was never in my mind, but I always knew I couldn't get I couldn't be legally married to him. Or, I was going to get stuck with his debt I don't know how I knew it I knew it. All along. So anyway, so we told everybody, we got married, but we did because I would be stuck with over 100,000 in debt, right now, they would take my home and anyway so so anyway after after he did die, that was a big deal because. We told everybody, we were married, but we weren't so I wasn't the next of kin which I knew I would have be and I didn't want to be his his. 20 year old son, he was 28 when towards denied. And then the mother was mad. Because I don't have that debt so and then she won my house. Anyway, he didn't get stuck with it either the kid."
748.0,Provider,Oh good.
12336.0,Patient,"I don't think so, what do you I don't think they're gonna make them. How can they make a. His. yeah hey and, to be honest, the deck came from the mother taking him to court six times over 10 years. And she like never accomplished anything except literally spending those. boys college tuition between the two of us like the two families. And she left him, and she acted so because she didn't think I was going to walk along. So anyway."
748.0,Provider,So there's a lot of baggage that goes along with the grief.
12336.0,Patient,A lot yeah the fact that that I have to suck it up now. And like if I don't. suck it up and be friendly with your i'm never going to see them like. So I have to I don't have a choice.
748.0,Provider,"or they close to you in Europe in their own right, did they want to see you."
12336.0,Patient,"yeah but they don't oh it's so long so complicated i'm Elliot my husband was a really, really bad highly functioning alcoholic. He. He was a dermatologist and he was like every his patients loved him. me didn't. Know us. He was an alcoholic and like copious amounts. Like after he died, and I was cleaning up the House on fire. A big bottles like I knew how much it was drinking but. It just sucks when you have to clean up all the empty bottles. Anyway, so i'm a year and, like a half, almost a year and a half ago, like a year before he died, I think. ice I used to drink with him. I met him and I Party I didn't I wasn't no colic I guess like. They know that. I was like. eating a budding anyway. I quit drinking a year and a half ago you said thought he would be. So, then, I just never started again because it never seemed fun after that anyway. So."
748.0,Provider,But that's me that's an important piece of your life that's a really positive piece of your life.
12336.0,Patient,What.
748.0,Provider,That you're not drinking.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah but I wasn't. I can. Do something and then not if I don't care about it, like I don't know winery looked down because I was, I think I slept in the tank top. i've had millions and I have none right now I have none, but. Money I don't care money. I just care about love it you love me so much. nobody's ever loved me as much as he did, but he was also should be drunk he was really verbally abusive. I will be laughing because i'm crying Michigan, but when I think about it. Even though he loves me so much he's still. The alcoholism was out of control, like, I was in another, I was in another group through. September from September until he died in March sorry the windows are open, I don't my neighbors hear me my dog is right there my account left me oh she's done anyway. Sorry. i'm. Okay, so he was such a bad alcoholic but his drinking was soda control when he was at home, it was out of control at work, but nobody knew but. wow that's a whole other can of worms for me that i've never gone into with anybody that I feel huge guilt over because I ran his office. Anyway, um and I didn't get paid. Whatever um. So. I think it was a year and a half, oh yeah right around the time that I quit drinking what okay What happened was. My history is so long is 21 year old is an addict and an alcoholic and he has odd. And been brought back to life, probably. Four times he's been locked up on."
748.0,Provider,opiates opiates.
12336.0,Patient,xanax I guess.
748.0,Provider,amazon's with alcohol. yeah well that's something for us.
12336.0,Patient,"I know. It but he would take like that's Another thing I used to take xanax because I legitimately had anxiety attacks and I had a prescription for 10 years. I didn't notice, he was stealing mine in the beginning, I quickly locked him in the safe but that's another drug like. He said to me one time he's like What do you mean you've never used it i'm like no and what I see when you do it doesn't look fun like he doesn't even remember this stuff he's so freaky when it's happening it's like he's the son is super sweet and and. he's not he the dad was angry when he was drunk. And he wouldn't it us but it got to the point where he would like one time he just destroyed his office in front of mason and I. When you, it was a weekend nobody was there, and he was drunk and you weren't a whole thing apart, but like that's what they mean like. violet he was a violent toward us, and he wouldn't like yeah in the end, he he did call me names in the end because he he thought I thought I was better than him, but I didn't. didn't think it was better I thought it was his role model."
748.0,Provider,So you're saving by good as you could be.
12336.0,Patient,"Anyway, so when I quit drinking. mason had a deed rate up right before I quit drinking and the reason I remember, now there is another reason I quit was because mason was going into rehab so I wanted. mason's the 21 year old. I wanted him to. have somebody sober. He could live with when he got out. Meaning me like one person I didn't mean the whole of. her family, because, even if he went to his mother's she I don't think she's an alcoholic but there's alcohol her boyfriend have alcohol, but i'm pretty sure there's they're not using it i'm so. Sorry they're doing reconstruction next door and I lost my train of thought listening the banging um. Where was I."
748.0,Provider,Was excited to have mason and rehab.
12336.0,Patient,"Okay, we dropped him off at rehab and. The two younger boys moved out of our House like permanently and prior to that it was back and forth like they would it was always 5054 9498 years it was 5050 bucks except for the year she literally. stole them from them and didn't let them see them for the first year, whatever she's seen so many bad mean hurtful spiteful things that it's hard for me to forget about it, though."
748.0,Provider,Was that because of his drinking or.
12336.0,Patient,No. she's she's a good person she's just he is was. um she's just. faithful jealous hang on wait other ones are going to hang.
748.0,Provider,On okay.
12336.0,Patient,"So um he's like spiteful and like i'm not like i've always been the kind of person who I talk so worried we. Have employees. i've always been the kind of person i'd rather hang around with people who are funnier prettier more intelligent anything that, why do you want to be the best at everything that's no fun like you have nowhere to go, so I don't get jealous like that. of people per se I don't get jobs and like I said I i've lived in $3 million houses with rooftop pools and and. Health Hello and elevators and right now i'm on unemployment, and I have like California boots deal. But I live in a House that's valued at 830 5000 and I only owe 280. So that's good."
748.0,Provider,yeah that's really good.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah I always knew. When I bought it that it was going to be. Because he didn't. I didn't ask him to pay me at work. and I ran his office and. I never I don't really spend a lot of money, I spend more now because I have to but i'm just i'm weird I grew up in Canada world very like basic like simple like. Not simple isn't stupid or ignorant, but just. Right easy to wear a lot."
748.0,Provider,of lifestyle.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah easy to get along with. we're big drinkers but mainly but we're not like. I didn't grow up with anybody who was like an angry drunker. I didn't grow up with anybody who I think drank too much, to be honest, my parents didn't even drink. Oh, my dad ran like. EA P programs and wrote a book for like alcoholics the recovering alcoholics or addicts who needed to be kept in their workplace and to help them and not chain them so it's weird house and he didn't drink and then I end up with a raging alcoholic. liver so."
748.0,Provider,granny addiction in your family.
12336.0,Patient,"No Oh well. Not that i'm aware of no I mean I personally think my brothers drink too much, but I used to drink too much until I stopped like so I don't know no not in my family. That i'm aware of, but yeah like when I drank with torsten you could have easily said I was an alcoholic, but I could drink that much I just didn't make the same choices when I did like I never got a dui I never couldn't go to work. I don't get hangovers anymore, because i'm an adult. go anyway, so I guess if i'd had. repercussions for drinking maybe. be different, but. I never got in trouble for anything anyway, he did that he got a dui he got he was he was in big trouble I found out at the end he was up. The medical board, he was up for suspension or something I found the paperwork, because he had been he'd gotten too many I had called the police on him before and. He had a domestic violence, because he pushed me once but it's it, it was domestic violence, but it wasn't hurt me. Whatever. me know why I care anymore, though."
748.0,Provider,Because it's all things that have happened to you and you're carrying the trauma in your body. yeah that's why.
12336.0,Patient,"I missing so much Oh, but that's what I started, so you two things okay i'll finish the story, but the kids so the kids had moved out. So, and, as he was getting worse, with his drinking, I was telling his mother, I would call her in texture and i'd say like he's not the same person anymore, and he just was really declining and. His mental like he. Just didn't think the same anymore. And I barely got to see the guy who I was in love with. At the end because he was always drunk. Anyway, come so his kids didn't want to be around that anymore, the two younger guys, so they had moved in with their mother and. So they moved in with their mother full time a year before he died a year and a half before he died and. mason continued to us, he was living with us he continued to use and drink, and so did torsten and it got so bad i've never told anybody this for my brothers no because they came when he died, but. It had gotten so stressful in my house at the end that I basically just lived in my bedroom like I didn't go downstairs I had a fridge up here I. It was too stressful so I lived up here. And I he he had put in cameras everywhere torsten so I couldn't see what was going on downstairs. But I didn't go down and. A couple months before he died, the neighbors had called the COPs they called the COPs all the time soon, because he was really loud. um. yeah and he would bang the wall and he would fall down a lot, he was noisy anyway, so I could see he and his son were fighting and they call the COPs and then. 13 I was watching it all go down or bring monitor outside but didn't know and then. 30 minutes into it, they realized, I was in the House upstairs the police and they made me go down and they're like why didn't you come down on my cuz This is none of my deal because I was in that that's the other part of the story, I was in this other program online. called love over addiction and it had it was saving my life, it was like teaching me how to place boundaries and teaching me how to be happy if I if I didn't if I wasn't ready to leave him I had to be happy, and so it was teaching me how to be I was happy actually I was. I was going to leave them and he knew I was, I was going to leave with my Christmas this year it, but it was going to do it like. Oh, I was gonna wing us apart because we were like totally alone, but his drinking was so unhealthy, so I was going to move to Florida. Because I have a brother there and. kind of like go back and forth for a while until I could see if he would quit and if you wouldn't quit and I had to go and I talked to him about it, and he knew and. It sucks because. I would be further ahead, but I would have been more devastated when he died does that make sense."
748.0,Provider,Oh absolutely.
12336.0,Patient,"I would have been way further ahead in my own life and journey, if I had just left him. But I probably I don't think I would have been able to rebound from the like depression from that would have been too much of a shock, because nobody has ever died that I will just like a couple acquaintances my. I never knew my mother's parents and my well I didn't know her mother, but I don't remember her and. My father's parents my father's dad molested me until I was in like third grade. um. So once I told my parents side in third grade. I never really had, I never really had to see them much again and unbeknownst to me they still did things with him when I was gone to college with my younger brothers, which was pretty hurtful when I found that out, but whatever. nobody's loyal any. Any way my dad says he only did it. A couple times for my brothers and whatever, why do they need a shitty person in their life. So I never had to deal with death so it's bit of dogs my dogs have died one lives, I had one until she was 19 actually. torsten and all three of the boys it's so cool now because we've been talking about my jack russells lately and. The boys remember my dogs who so decrepit at the end when she was 19 she was blind, deaf, but I couldn't put her down yet, because I was going through a divorce and just met torsten I mean I I was the very end of the horrible divorce like three year like. He was gay and didn't bother to tell me when we got married even the last. Whatever those bad decision on my part. I make bad choices um. and Remember me asleep floor so they may have said. i'm Okay, I think I did have one last thing, yes, but the boys Christian and hayden the two youngest because they had moved out a year and a half before he died. They moved out in yeah they moved out in September before he died. No a year before yeah September year before and. It wouldn't really even see him or talk to him at the end and I had everybody to the House for his birthday, which was October 21. And not might have been that was for sure, the last time, like his parents and his kids and me we're all in the same room that was the last time was his birthday last year, which is this month and. So i'm. Even at Christmas. We didn't exchange gifts with them or anything we had mason with us, he was with us. The eldest. But Christian and he didn't we didn't even buy them anything and so after he died. They didn't want to come over here you'd asked me earlier that's what started to be on this, you said, do they come over to the House or something and I said, well, no. Because he they weren't coming here because they him at the end and then he died here, no i'm stuck here in a House they don't even want to come to. get it. But i'm not moving. Yes, for sure i'm."
748.0,Provider,"i'm hearing any hard for them to be in that house with all the memories and their dad being gone, but it's not time for you to move yet."
12336.0,Patient,"Right and Christian actually is getting it Tony bit better he used as come over twice recently like twice this past week. We share the dog with them not I mean not I don't share her I lender I let her go for sleep overs. Extended ones they've had it for like two weeks, at a time, but it's all it's fine but. The couple times that they had her for two weeks at the end it was getting too much for me, I was really getting depressed um. But mason the 21 year olds doing great he's in hair school now he's still drinking, but I don't think he's using drugs i'm drinking, just as bad for him, though he's a little calm. And he lives with his mother and I just saw his room over there, for the first time on his birthday, on Sunday and that torsten parents and all three boys and her Jennifer at her house and when I was sitting there me it was so cute mason the. 21 year old mason's. A 21 year old in like a nine year olds. mentality, you know he's a sweet sweet kid. that's what I wrote on his birthday card I said wow happy 21st mason you. Have the life experience of a 51 year old in a 21 year olds body with a nine year olds like mentality, he knew I didn't mean that like insulting and he laughed um. But he's good he was go to Barber school Paul Mitchell and he he's going for two months now, Monday to Friday eight to 530. And he started an instagram account, which he always like made fun of people and he's doing really good, so it was cute and, since they. Join us in a room as a yeah do you want to see your room, you know because he was living over here but Christian and hayden didn't ask me if I wanted to go upstairs and see there, so I just left it alone. Because they had already separated, you know and that's another thing torsten had a strange himself, he had kind of his parents out of his life and he'd cut his boys out of his life will even cut them out, but they didn't hang out anymore, they."
748.0,Provider,"Tell absence yeah and the more severe the disease of addiction gets isolation, there is some more I mean it's it's a combination of fear and shame and it's so painful to witness Is that how he died."
12336.0,Patient,Here take one of the beauties. Day everybody keto os utterances but. There was. Drinking I mean he was he didn't have alcohol in the system at the time. or. You didn't do drugs.
748.0,Provider,That he had destroyed his system. yeah and he was vulnerable with the diabetes for sure. What a huge last year walking through. How many levels.
12336.0,Patient,"And I feel badly for his mother because. They weren't even speaking in stores time she didn't talk to him, like. He cut her off, you know I feel so bad for her she's so sweet. Anyway, that's not my I didn't I didn't cause that I didn't do it. I can understand it, because it hurts but. I told her about the program I was doing she could have done it as well, there were mother in law's in it. Anyway, so. So the boys were strange that his parents were estranged. I miss when. He was my best friend. Even though. His life was gone down the drain, he just. nobody's ever had that much love for me his love was just so unconditional even before you eat really bad with alcohol like would it, but it wasn't like he didn't drink in the daytime or the."
748.0,Provider,addiction is a progressive disease i'm sure you've heard that before it gets worse it doesn't get better and it doesn't stay the same.
12336.0,Patient,"Take over your life. Did it totally did. And anyway, he loved us so much they were but they don't do that and the stuff we did with the way don't even know if they remember now like. We rented an rv and go God we did that same trip that laundry and potato did the same dribbling we went to mount rushmore it was so much fun, it was not at the time it was fun at the time. But on Facebook I kept a journal. Of all the good and the bad. I remember one of the posts, I was hiding in the rv laundry. Because I knew nobody would find me there. Anyway, we took them to the tetons and his sister lives in Montana, so we took them to see her, and that was one year in summer break, another year we took him to the Dominican Republic another year we did tense and we tend not an rv just tense another year we took them to Canada. We took them to Boston but, in the last two years. We didn't have money like we had no money and they didn't live with us so. They don't remember those because they're so gone now, and since then she's taken them like everywhere, so they those our trips good. You know."
748.0,Provider,Later shadowed.
12336.0,Patient,"And so I want to like bucket right now and I don't have the energy, I want to go find this person's photos because he was always taking photos and. print them so they can at least see with their own eyes, he adored them we would everywhere yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Somewhere in their cells, they know that. And even I don't have the."
12336.0,Patient,visual memory.
748.0,Provider,They have that in their body.
12336.0,Patient,But we knew it wasn't going anywhere today.
748.0,Provider,"need to get you feeling good about you and and, of course, one of the most important steps toward that is doing the grief work that you're doing. Unfortunately don't get to skip that step."
12336.0,Patient,yeah socks yeah.
748.0,Provider,Is that what brought you to bright hurt.
12336.0,Patient,"Yes. Yes. Because they don't have insurance so. i'm even the program I was in I was on like a scholarship I had to apply for it, we didn't have any money at the end is drinking was so don't control it. You didn't make the right decisions I just was like hanging on for dear life yeah. And then, so what is practice when he died, he was the only one at the practice and. It was. In shambles so we just let it all fall through the cracks like nobody did anything, nobody sold the patient list his parents and I shut the office down. He owed the landlord 20,000. Week literally I where the hell did all our money go like. I never asked to live never cared because I had many what I met him when I met him I had like a million, so I bought a house and a timeshare That was a really big waste of money. um. I just never. I didn't care about anything I just cared about. You know, food, shelter. A job. Friends making waffles after school for the boys. I used to always like try and make the really good like after school like snacks and stuff because he never did, and so I would like. Make like faces on plates with vegetables and stuff. They used to tease me because I have all these like. I have all kinds of things, but I have tons of like hostess platters and dishes and. Things that spin and they loved it, it was so perfect for them, you know because they're like things that you have when you live in a big $3 million House and you have to entertain it, but I I used it for them was great. They loved it I took pictures of them I could find I would take pictures of the faces and stuff make chicken nugget faces I just I love them I love having them around. I wouldn't I knew right then and there, though I, it would be probably different if i'd given birth to them, but I liked just having them around half of the time I liked having date we that's why our relationship was so great, too, because, like as far as being in love. Because we were together like your best friends and that's why I drank with them in the beginning, like it was fun until it wasn't fun. But yet so much fun. But then when I realized this isn't fun and I quit need could. Not this was another bad choice. Did you get your booster. Oh, you should I did."
748.0,Provider,I actually have to wait a while I said okay yeah.
12336.0,Patient,"Your business sorry I just wouldn't i'm on a crusade my neighbor down the street i'm in a very it's weird my house is worth a lot but i'm i'm in like an area that is like drive by shootings. i'm in. The Middle the ghetto. But that's the price of the House it's weird um but it's almost all of pasadena now my witness or that's what quiet I would get shot um anyway i'm friends with another neighbor in the block down the street and. he's my age, but he he looks like he's a teenager from his body so but he's not is like 50 and. So i've been talking to him when I go out walking and stuff and. It was my point is to tell you something."
748.0,Provider,We were talking about backs the vaccinate.
12336.0,Patient,"The vaccine yes yeah Thank you. And he. Is not vaccinated and so I said, why are you vaccinated and he said well a vegan and. You know if you find one that's vegan so I have vegan friends in Vancouver so I got on the phone with them and they did some backwards and so he's gonna go get this shot. I just. yeah I sent them stuff from Peta so."
748.0,Provider,that's great.
12336.0,Patient,"yeah so anyway, I wasn't trying to be nosy it was more of."
748.0,Provider,"Like, no, no, I know. curiosity Barbecue but."
12336.0,Patient,"I figured. You would have to be anyway, I would think I don't know oh that's The other thing so his mother. The boy's mother I don't know i'm whispering on this shouldn't live right here the boy's mother. was always i'm democrat, which was a big deal to my husband, he was democrat and not on paper i'm not i'm nothing on paper, because I, I want to have the option to change. Right now i'm not not republican right now but I, you know I agree with a lot and at one point in my life I was republican but. Anyway, um. He said I get so excited I forgetting anything i'm publican Oh, the boys, the mother she man she left my left out a whole other sort of man, she left torsten for was mason's baseball club. And mason was a good baseball player on a travel team like it was a big deal and, like all the parents knew it was going on, that she was having an affair. But torsten wouldn't accept it, he was one of those people and I didn't even know, it was possible like OJ he was one of those people who could lie to themselves, he was the most intelligent man i've ever had the. fortune of being with like and love intelligence and I love humor and. I take those way over physical looks. Anyway, um. So she's republican because the boyfriends Republican and they've been living there for the past year and a half and. Oh, my God Christian, who I believe if if you're going to go with a whole grand scheme of things, I believe that Christian and I. have some if there's another world we were meant I was meant to be in this life this part of my life, because a Christian, for some reason I don't understand why and it's weird from the very second I ever met him when he was seven years old, I met them and I had this weird like. connection I was gonna say attraction, but it wasn't an attraction of as a connection it was really weird and here it gets even weirder I didn't know but Christian didn't speak. At all until kindergarten like he spoke to his parents, but in pre K, not once did he speak, he was so shy, and I am the polar opposite of shy. i'm I have social anxiety and i'm i'm nervous in front of people, but I don't appear so i'm like really out there and I worked in TV and i'm in our marine comedians and I, like, I have no problem with me, but a lot of people do because i'm i'm loud really loud. So Christian ended up finding a happy medium, because he and I did a lot together like he's really creative and we would do school projects, together with my like. artist friends, you know, like he got to have because I I came I came from a total I right now come from a world or did 10 years ago of like. Famous people lots of Famous people lots of celebrities lots of like lots of them, and that was my world and and I worked in that world too and. So when I met them, I was like an alien to these three boys and this doctor who come from beaver cleaver world up here like locking yada it's all like. Anyway, so I was exotic to them, and so I I taught them so many things they never ever would have learned. Christian especially he was like a sponge she's soaked up everything and. and I think that's what hurt me the most popular tourist and died, I thought Okay, maybe you know back into my life, but they were like really they wouldn't come here and. I worked with Tara on it a lot. And or not yeah Tara and. I just let him be and I think she was right he's starting to come back around, and I think it helped him a lot because he's come to see me twice since Sunday. Know once he came Saturday and then he came again after Sunday, but my my reasoning is that he saw that. He didn't have to worry for once there was something between his two families if he could just sit back and actually not get a stomach ache and have lunch, you know, nobody was fighting. we've never torsten never sat down with them with their mother after she left him he never got over her leaving him and he couldn't get over it like he wasn't in love with her, but he. I think that he had a. Switching his personality from things i've been researching online, I think it was too devastating to him. That. 10 years ago when she left him he he he turned into an alcoholic he might have been already going that way I don't know."
748.0,Provider,It just it went further downhill quickly.
12336.0,Patient,"Well that's when it yeah because to get for him, he couldn't deal with it, he could only drink and and I had all these cool friends with cool parties, and we would drink, you know and. We didn't do drugs I swear I keep saying that to you because I don't want you to think that i'm. Because i'll be you know why i'm hypersensitive to it because everybody just assumes because he was a doctor, he was a drug addict and he wasn't at all at all, and it forced them to smoke weed with me I I smoke marijuana but I. yeah I did I always have since I was in I quit for like probably 15 years. Because I was with a hockey player who didn't want me to smoke weed it's like okay. Anyway, um yeah, so I hope Christian keeps coming back around that it actually really invigorated me i'm going to show you actually This is my bedroom, which is so this is the room where torsten died and. i'll send over here cnc behind my back is killing me. I didn't make that because I was still sitting in it, but so there's my desk back there and there's one TV. Yes, was well thanks was not really beautiful per se, but this is where he died in it was the furniture was completely different um it didn't look anything out like this it didn't look like this and. I didn't start doing anything to this room until like maybe a month ago, and it was like a cut you know I started it was like I was. 14 or something and I wasn't cleaning it. I was doing the exact opposite I was doing from when I lived in it like I wouldn't come up here to sleep. In the bed was on the floor. The mattress it was an old mattress whatever so once this started, then I I started feeling was about a month ago, and I started, because I got really depressed again and went. down the whole month ago. And then I was charting it with Tara. And I finally got back up again and so i'm here so that's why, when I started crying Oh, you get to me when I started praying earlier was like no i'm so afraid I call it going down the well and like when down the well I could be there for like months days hours and it's."
748.0,Provider,"I couldn't read her I could really hear that, where you were going was released release of grief and then dropping into hopelessness. Okay."
12336.0,Patient,And yeah I know what you mean.
748.0,Provider,"And you know it when we can really start to release when we open up a chunk of the reef and. He. Sorry, I just got a notification I hate it when that happens."
12336.0,Patient,"Oh, I love this This is great because you're going to do it, too, and when I get excited it's way worse so. Please, I love it."
748.0,Provider,"Thank you, I but I I just know that that sometimes when we're so afraid of dropping into those places that feel like we can't get out, especially depression yeah that we also avoid the feelings that are healing."
12336.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And, and I could you know, so I think that today what you did was a lot of release. That you keep moving up. and away from while still remembering the love that you have the sorrow, what was the loss that desire for building that connection with your step sons. And that's all beautiful work. Really."
12336.0,Patient,"The other thing, though, than their mother when she found out we weren't married like she did really shitty things to me, she made the boys call me to ask me what I would like my last name to say on their high school graduation. Look visitor thing and. nobody's asking for ID at an outdoor high school graduation, it was to humiliate me and and it did, and then she. said she's who should be then. She males in the mail a picture of like that she'd had done herself from mail them to a bunch of people. of Christian Christians graduation right like I was added I I know the picture, whatever she took the picture and had it done for people to announce it. OK, so the envelope says Lisa Severn it doesn't say Lisa graybill graybill was the name I used I have stationary with graybill on it, everybody all his patients thought I was Lisa graybill she thought. I was Lisa grable. And so I go to my mail and she's mailed me things Lisa graybill I go to my mail. it's Lisa suffering or something and I open it up nothing inside, except for this picture, so I broke down sobbing was like outside of so upset. That was the day that was the first time I needed xanax that was June, it was the first time I really was having an anxiety attack and I didn't have xanax and I was forced to. He brought to us all the things i've learned and it worked, and that was great that it happened, though, because now I overcome the anxiety every time. Not knock on wood be I don't need the xanax but I did that day oh my God. Anyway, so, so I called my friend told her what Jennifer done and jennifer's like Oh, but. um she mailed me the high school graduation her, but she mailed me mason's too, and I went what. So. Two weeks later, I don't know why she waited two weeks, I guess, it would have a full one back she did it again with the other kids. But yet she mailed everybody else's together in one. Why would she do that. So she can. throw it in my face again yeah that's a shooting person who does that shit. I know you."

12336.0,Patient,"stuff isn't even the old and she said way more than. I mean even since he's died it's like I said, one day, like it's like she's picking wings off a butterfly like why why leave me alone you, you took you took all the toys away from me and know you're making it drilling it into their head that are not related to that."
