My name is chuck and we're going to do the what they call a bias like social assessment it's going to ask you questions about your biological history so like medical concerns on. hospitalizations surgery stuff of that nature injuries anything like that, and then anything that might run that might be hereditary that might run in your family history and then we'll ask psychological questions about. Mental health concerns diagnosis is self reporting periods of mental health concerns and then anything that might run in your family history will talk about social settings occupation. Military history education peer support people that you associate with hobbies stuff like that and. we'll do demographics to in the beginning, so some basic information, the idea is that once the assessment is completed, that a. Treatment plan for you can be developed, like developed so it'll identify some areas that need to be addressed and then base that we can make improvements it's critical that we do the the assessment for all new patients it's pretty standard practice amongst all levels of care okay. So do you have any questions before we start about the program or expectations or anything like that."

15345.0,Patient,"um I have a lot of mental health issues, I saw like. i've been i've went to a local. place to reach out for help before and I just feel like they weren't helping. So I think I found myself self medicating a lot. So here I am I love, I like this program it's really helped me it's changed my life so far."
724.0,Provider,"Okay cool. And you're based out of California. Ohio Ohio. Oh yeah most of the clients that I see are all based out of out there is based, out of California so. Really it's only recently that i've been getting more like a while patients. Alright, so we're going to go over your drug history so i'll present a substance and then you'll be like nope never did it yeah I did it and then we'll go from there i'll ask you what age you first started using at what age it became a problem."
15345.0,Patient,You know this is private correct like.
724.0,Provider,"Everything you. know everything is protected under hipaa without releases of information, signed by you, we don't release information to anybody unless you are. You know, upon request, say we get like an outsider provided and they're like hey we want some information you work in nursing so everything's covered on the hip or and 42 CFR so."
15345.0,Patient,What do you worry about my ex husband he's a psychopath.
724.0,Provider,Unless you sign a release of information for your ex husband there's no way for him to obtain any your medical records and it's all falls on the Hippo so. Nothing is released without your your.
15345.0,Patient,"Legal report, which I only said that because I we went through court with. want to with my spouse's. He went through court to get one of his gets in the Guardian ad litem requested that somebody sign a release that information for that person's. Mental health records for the counseling place they was going to and I just thought that was in base know if that was a thing or not, that."
724.0,Provider,"No, I mean we can be you know i've worked in agencies were courts of intervene and like subpoenaed records, but there's entire like legal departments that work for agencies like that that will you know they'll cover all basic. You know, medical law and make sure all the criteria is met again like. Like we're in the business of not i've always been in the business i'm not releasing people's information, even when there was a release of information on file. So, say, theoretically, you did have one on file for your ex and he called and was like hey I want to know this, I would be like well cool arm. I can't confirm or deny if that person's here, but I will most certainly get back to you, and then I would contact you or contact the person directly be like hey i'm so and so. Calling here, asking for information, I see you got to release information on file Do you still want me to do that this is what it seems like they're asking and sometimes people are like oh no I don't even talk to that person anymore and it's like cool. So I just play I play ignorant I leave the legal interventions to the to the experts that's not my field and."
15345.0,Patient,"I think it's sad that people can use that like in custody like you know mental health issues that people have and. Well, I mean I get it in situation where kids are being harmed."
724.0,Provider,"But yeah I mean there's a place for everything you know what I. mean like i'm sure, things are. human nature is to never do what's right before something wrong happens so they. They tend to the pendulum 10s of swing to the most extreme outcome were just like university we're just going to do with everybody because we had one situation that was bad. And 20 that were never got to that point but because that one was bad where it was going to make it extreme this one way and that's the. Key things going on, I mean you see it everywhere at this point. Politically, you see it everywhere now it's."
15345.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"One extreme to the other, they don't know how to manage it so that's that's the deal. So on our end we have you know departments that handle medical records and retention and all that kind of stuff so they don't release information unless there's a release of information on file, you know. Okay, that protects everybody. Alright, so now we'll go over the drug history. Have you ever used alcohol. Yes, okay at what age, did you start using alcohol."

724.0,Provider,So some more recreational. yeah okay um any hallucinogens.

15345.0,Patient,I have a medical marijuana card.
724.0,Provider,"What age, did you start using marijuana."
15345.0,Patient,16.
724.0,Provider,"Some some of these things were were I asked you for a date like don't get. don't get like spot where you're like Jesus I don't like just like like approximate we can be like teenagers and will be like. You know the late teenagers or early teenage like some people like for history it's like I don't remember when I did that, and then they get all frustrated like we just need like ballpark estimates. I think kind of it, it pays like a picture of like what early onset for experiment was. And in my history what i've seen is like when I go through this section it's like weed an alcohol or like. For number one and number two you know and you're like what age and like I don't know 12 to 14 and it's like yeah pretty standard why. Why is that because our goals and our House with our family and we probably have an older sibling that has weed or parents have we and it's like so that's pretty the salmon. It always goes to like. Maybe pills like nowadays, like the generation, like the newer generation is like pills there, whereas like probably like our generation because you're at scale right born in the 80s. yeah would have it probably would have been like cocaine and then maybe pill so it's like these little things that we can kind of track generationally and. what's going on and then like when you hit like the 2000s like. The early 2000s mid 2000s or like that's sort of like like opiate pills really coming to come because, like a lot of people and within within our age group um I don't know anybody in my age group that use heroin, you know what I mean so it's like."
15345.0,Patient,Back right.
724.0,Provider,"So stability of that type of stuff pills weren't around so and people were like for sure not going to go into the city and like meet up with a guy in an alley for needles like that's Freddy krueger stuff was not there. It was always like the like the party stuff so like alcohol we cocaine. You know, and then I feel bad for the other generation that came up after us, because then everything."
15345.0,Patient,Oh yeah no I that's what i've told. People all of.
724.0,Provider,your friends breaking up a little bit.
15345.0,Patient,"But no, nobody. Is that better. yep okay."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a random thing, but really it's about timing, you know accessibility. Okay um what was the last time you use thc."
15345.0,Patient,"i'm probably about two weeks ago I quit sometimes I do that sometimes i'll stop smoking because my anxiety gets so bad, it makes it worse and i'll just stop smoking and I know I don't i'm like I said i'll go months without smoking and then just start again."
724.0,Provider,"Sometimes it's good for a reset. And we does that have have a tendency of making internal dialogue very loud, for some people."
15345.0,Patient,yeah it does that's what it does for me.
724.0,Provider,"And for sure that that doesn't help with anxiety because, like. Some people like they're like the know forgive my language, like they're like sometimes like the asshole voice comes out and it's really loud when they're. not ready to have those conversations like with themselves and that. creates anxiety so. You know the idea is to like use less to avoid having that you know service, because some people don't like like a. weed will have a way of showing you like really what's going on in your life and you're not ready to address it so like a lot of stuff is suppressed, but we'd kind of heightens that for some people paranoia anxiety all that stuff or. Secondary so I used to think like paranoia was like something, because you know again in our age group was like it was illegal you know almost everywhere so like the idea of like. You know, being vulnerable and then having a cop show up like I thought that was paranoid, but then everybody's like no no that's not my that's not really my concern is like it's legal now Why am I so apparently you know what I mean it's."
15345.0,Patient,"thing i'm like what is my problem, like, I have a whole prescription, my name is on the bottle."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you're like it's like this nefarious thing that you shouldn't be doing but it's a little bit of that, but then a little bit of like what's going on internally what's going on in your life, where you're at and. That mental headspace is crucial, so if you ever heard of like like set and setting. is like a clinical concept, where it's like if you're in the right mindset and the right setting things are probably going to be okay so like when people do like. hallucinogens it's like you're probably not going to want to do, LSD and go watch a horror movie that is not a good mindset, to be in this up a good setting be and. If you're expecting to have like a really nice experience that's probably not going to happen in that scenario so like mindset and setting a very important. So if you're not in the right mindset doesn't really matter what he can just amplifies like that internal noise for a lot of people so."
15345.0,Patient,"yeah and then me it like spence me out of control i'm like. Thinking about the crazy like I start worrying like you said it's It shows me what's going on with my life, but then I take it to 1000 like okay Well, this is what's wrong, so this is what could happen, and I could definitely just. die tomorrow perfect. or somebody could snatch my kids from me or a crazy stuff and. and be out sometimes and that's where i'm like Okay, I need to take a break for a week."
724.0,Provider,"it's not bad for a reset it does have cognitive impairments like for sure. Like people, because the side effects aren't as bad as you know, lots of other things, but you can't pretend like nothing bad you know is happening to your body. is delaying it is nah man, it is like it's it's a lot of things. yeah it's no crazy withdrawal symptom when you stop you know what I mean it's not like you're not in control, you know when you when you smoke weed and all that kind of stuff, but it does for sure it's like anything else tylenol has adverse reactions on your kidneys your liver and stuff. But I have a headache and it takes care of the headache and it's like yep for now and then it's going to deal with something they'll deal with something later if you keep using it, so no biological free lunch so. Anyway, any caffeine use coffee."
15345.0,Patient,"Our drinks energy drinks coffee monsters, those are Michael is."
724.0,Provider,"A is a problem for you or. It. hard to gauge for coffee it's where if you're having like if you have to stop it, like every dunkin donuts or coffee shop every time you see one that I would say it's a problem but. In."
15345.0,Patient,"The morning when I first wake up, I gotta have some coffee to get me go and but then i'm good I don't. Then it's monsters i'll switch to monsters in the afternoon."
724.0,Provider,Any nicotine us to smoke tobacco.
15345.0,Patient,I smoke cigarettes.
724.0,Provider,How long you been smoking for.
15345.0,Patient,Since I was about 14 years old 1314 years old.
724.0,Provider,How much you smoke on a daily average.
15345.0,Patient,"About a pack a day, sometimes more lately I probably even spoken more. A Pack and a half, sometimes."
724.0,Provider,If you if you're interested in any point to. look into like tobacco cessation like the providers here can probably work with you and come up with a game plan go on patches.
15345.0,Patient,Hopefully at some. point.
724.0,Provider,"that's right say sometimes sometimes. Having the video off. makes the audio better because if you're in a bad spot you're not on wi fi or cellular networks aren't very like dependable So if you need to like like turn the video off on it, because it keeps canceling we're cool you're setting there's nobody here so."
15345.0,Patient,"My battery Thank you I got 10%, but I have an iPhone so my 10% will last minute, but."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
15345.0,Patient,"It takes the video a mid semester, not to like."
724.0,Provider,The what.
15345.0,Patient,Is my video messing up to or my audio.
724.0,Provider,"The audio will drop off because it again your phone is probably in. Our power mode and it's trying to pull video too so it's why it's doing double duty right now so. And receptions perceptions, always a difficult thing with these guns. Have you ever been in treatment before for substance abuse."
15345.0,Patient,"Now it was really hard for me to do this, this time because i've always looked at myself as somebody like I don't have a problem so."
724.0,Provider,"How did you start using pills were you injured, you get a prescription for."
15345.0,Patient,My first child I had my first child when I was. I got pregnant at 17 howdy my 18 and they prescribe they they prescribed me I don't think they make them anymore they're I think they're called darvocet. yeah.
724.0,Provider,that's what they want a long time.
15345.0,Patient,"huh and they were like. I tried and i'm like. I took up and they didn't help with the pain, but I, like the feeling that they meet IV profound profound help more than Darmstadt did, but I, like the feeling that they gave me and then I didn't really I just did that prescription out and then I did in. House have anything else until I was probably 20 or 21 I did a percocet for the first time with. My ex husband well one of. My one of my kids his father's I did one with him he's passed away now of overdose but I had. A perk 10 with him and he we started it that's the first person I ever started one list and I loved it so um but then like I said it still wasn't a problem I did it that. One time and I didn't really I did it a couple more times, after that, but it wasn't something that we did on a all the time basis or whatnot even once a month or every two months, it was just wanted it maybe a couple times a year and. Then I got pregnant for my. Second, child another C section. They gave me darvocet was out that they quit making. They gave me a prescription of like. And I love I got the like, then, and I have used them, obviously, because I knew I could sort them so. That even then I would say I didn't obviously now that's like a red flag like your story and the pills, you know but. I thought I didn't have a problem. and I did that prescription up and didn't do it again for a long time, like I said, I would say I would do that on and off every time I had a baby, they would give me all these pills."
724.0,Provider,So really like a like an opportunist like.
15345.0,Patient,"yeah exactly when I had the opportunity. To do it, I would do it, but after that i'd be like I wouldn't I wasn't seeking them I wasn't finding pill people who sold pills or anything like of that sort. But with my last one. My last baby and 2016 I had a terrible pregnancy, I had a really rough C section they had to put me to sleep during it. They had to scrape out my uterus um I woke up in so much pain, it was. Like. It was terrible and then with that baby I probably got all together, in the end they probably gave me. See 60 I want to say, like almost 200 percocet at the end, like not at a time, but I would get like a script of 60. And 90 then another's for in this was like an every few weeks thing couple. Like in a six months. or not i'd say, less than six months, like in three months time span i'd probably had the 200. pills."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's a lot and your body is obviously been on there, like tremendous trauma physical trauma."
15345.0,Patient,"You know, oh yeah and then it was just a bad place my X was. A piece of share that I have that I have two kids as dads and the one was a really good down on the overdose but this guy the other one is a fucking news man and he pulled me through how so I was had the percocet out the trash I had he was also a user. And he had lots of money, so he could just. By scripts and he just started buying scripts of like it ends and I still thought I had it under control, when I left him I quit doing the film i'm like I don't want it, I didn't even know I thought I was going to be sick. And I never felt that before never thought of myself that way and I had to think about it, like dare you think you're going to be saying. But I wasn't thankfully that time. But then I don't know what happened, the stress that i've undergone probably last. Four years I would say, has led up to what's happened over the past year I just started I had opportunities, where people I was around people who I knew sold pills. I have the opportunity to buy them, so I will I started buying them on my own. And just spun out of control click, then I was started being sick lately when I would stop that's what I noticed the last few months is when I didn't have them, I was only getting them like one time, a month. From this one person, and then I noticed that when I didn't have them like the two weeks, out of the month, that I didn't have them have them, I was sick."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, poor."
15345.0,Patient,"Oh, I. want to do anything I was so tired, I felt like I had the flu. mentally exhausted drained."

15345.0,Patient,i've never overdosed.
724.0,Provider,"What would you say is the longest period sense. Since you've been using opiates you were using somewhat on and off for a while and then became more consistent what's your longest period of sobriety What would you say, like the longest period that you had without using any opiates."
15345.0,Patient,"Early. yeah I would say years. I would like four years, maybe, and then there would be a time where I do it once and not again for another year well now that's not true because my kids my kids are all like two and three years apart."
724.0,Provider,"So it's about that. yeah well you got good resiliency then all right all right good. Good we can work that. Alright, so the next section now, you told me about your. is going to be about medical you know concerns diagnosis is that stuff of that nature now you've had how many C sections where they all C sections."

Like no way so yeah it takes a lot of guess okay um any any history of stroke or seizure or anything like that. And he any any family history of medical concerns anything that runs in your family.

724.0,Provider,"yeah I know, like in a postcode world like a lot of people's fallen off their PCP annual appointments so it's important that we. Try to make time to get to those things as we get older I know it's kind of a hassle to get work and family and all kinds of stuff but get yourself checked out at least once a year isn't a bad thing. All right next section is going to be mental health concerns have you ever been diagnosed with any mental health concerns Depression and anxiety bipolar."
15345.0,Patient,um yes i've had. i've been diagnosed with depression generalized anxiety disorder. ptsd. And i've had one person diagnosed with ADHD by us never went anywhere.
724.0,Provider,As an adult or as a kid.
15345.0,Patient,As an adult.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have any attention issues as a child."
15345.0,Patient,I know that I was terrible in school um. I would say yeah I couldn't pay attention to save my life. I dropped out of high school like in ninth grade so.
724.0,Provider,"yeah they um. i've done some research recently, and I say research like it like read articles and stuff like that um that miss diagnose childhood ADHD is much harder to diagnose and adults, but something like the secondary characteristics of ADHD is like anxiety depression it's like."
15345.0,Patient,"Well i've thought about that a lot like. And i've tried to get you know somebody to take that seriously, but I feel like they act like i'm drug seeking. yeah so and i'm like dude mess, not even my drug or 20s like kiss my ass like I don't I understand I guess, but like I really need hope, like I know it's not a joke i'm not trying to."
724.0,Provider,"I think what probably is happening right is that it's easier to diagnose. I would imagine it's easier to diagnose ADHD in children because it's like well they don't have time to be. depressed or anxious, so they could probably rule out some of the other things that US adults commonly will have to deal with because environmental factors, you know what I mean like. it's like, why are you anxious and it's like so I don't know it's like okay well how's work, and so I hate my job properly and lose it. Or you know what I mean like end and I could start figuring out be like well that's that could be a problem and that's causing you anxiety, why are you depressed but Adamo and it's like a dog died recently and it's like. Okay, so these things you know what I mean so, but as a kid it's like they could just sit back and watch a kid on the playground or talk to a teacher and be like oh yeah you know he's not he's not. An anxious kid he's an energy kids so it's why why it's easier diagnose it then, whereas with with us again with us adults, they can rule out all the other stuff because we're not on jungle jims and we're not fidgeting our seats, or whatever it is like we get all this."
15345.0,Patient,"Older like I. pick up a real hard time keeping jobs, like staying focused like I just had a really good job. That I loved I didn't make as much money as I did it other places, but I love the aspect of this job I love what I was doing um it really was a good fit for me and it's just like my mental health like come knocking. Your quit and this job. I love my job. And i've looked like I said i've looked into the ADHD thing because I feel like it's like. Like you, like that stuff is the is what causes my Depression and anxiety is the stuff that i'm doing. it's causing needs to be depressed and anxious and. You know i'm not the. psychiatry so I don't know what's going on, but I tried to sell side, no salt is right right."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean like like we could read it like you could go to a web md and it always ends, like in one way, but you could it's like anything else you can find symptoms that you're like I have that I have that. Those symptoms are pretty common amongst like lots of people. So it is hard, but while you're here, whoever you're missing your your providers. with us."
15345.0,Patient,I believe it's Julie. Julie yeah Jane.
724.0,Provider,"During like one of your one of your one on one sessions with her this bring it up and just be like I. feel like i've considered that I might have you know you know, on diagnose childhood add and it's turning into you know some of these other. Some of these other concerns, but I can't in the past, I haven't had anybody been able to take it serious, I would like to maybe take an assessment or maybe like look into this. You know what I mean can't hurt you know can't hurt to rule out some things, if possible, so when you meet with her, and you will schedule appointments with her. You know, one on one and just."
15345.0,Patient,One on one with her.
724.0,Provider,Try to try to remember to bring it up just be like hey have also got this thing like in my back pocket that i've put some thought into and maybe it's causing.
15345.0,Patient,"Like if that is what i've had, I thought about this like if that's what I have than you know, obviously i've used trucks to cover up a lot of other like that could be like all the problem, though, like why i'm. I don't know why is it yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Very well, could be you know what I mean so pursue that and and see where see where flushes out to. get it can't hurt you know you have the the inside, and it could be, you know I mean it's worth investigating a little bit further. Okay, have you ever been hospitalized for any mental health concerns. um and any family history of mental health concerns."
15345.0,Patient,Is that I think my lungs fast shit crazy but she's never been diagnosed with anything so right now on drugs pretty bad though and that's completely left from. Anything my entire life she'd never ever been the way she has right now so think she related somehow.
724.0,Provider,"Oh, so you can, if you can talk to her into some options, by all means it's worth."
15345.0,Patient,It I think when I get back home from vacation i've been thinking about that a lot.
724.0,Provider,Any any history of self harm suicidal thoughts of times.
15345.0,Patient,"The last um. I would say that's what drove me to get home as I started thinking like this, I wouldn't say I wanted to kill myself, but I just started thinking it would just be easier if I just was talking dead like i'm tired of doing this every day fashion live like this for the rest of my life."
724.0,Provider,"So, so no active plan, all of them like passive passive thoughts."
15345.0,Patient,yeah just.
724.0,Provider,"for coping strategies it's like you haven't developed anything else, and sometimes we look for like the easy solution nothing's ever as black and white life has never been."
15345.0,Patient,"A it's like it was anything serious, just like fucking tired, so now, I never thought this i'm going to do it, or no nothing like that."
724.0,Provider,"alright. Any history of trauma so emotional abuse physical abuse, sexual abuse."
15345.0,Patient,All of that.
724.0,Provider,"All that. Now we don't have to specifically get into it here, other than that there was a history there and that's something that you and I could potentially unpack if you felt comfortable enough over time. I don't realize that i'm a total stranger you're sitting in a. Gas station parking lot. I weren't prepared today to discuss some of that. You know some of that stuff but, if it exists and you feel comfortable over time to present it then you and I can process that I I worked with. trauma and grief counseling and all that stuff is very connected so working through like the like the step work of how we process the event, and you know whether or not we're suppressing it voiding it or we've acknowledged it and. Processed it to the point of like acceptance and kind of moved on from there and healed a little bit like we can we can talk all through that stuff. I have like history of you know, childhood trauma and I was in the military i've been overseas, and you know what I mean like i've been three tours in Iraq, like so like I i'm well aware of like like how people and human should. process trauma and and what what the experiences are so you would I can share a lot of. work through some shit."
15345.0,Patient,Service you.
724.0,Provider,"know not not you know, the fact that we all do it for one way or another i'm nationalistic who certain point, like we live in, like a pretty awesome country it's not the greatest right now for everybody's opinion but it's still better than any other country that. i've so it's like a lot of people like when they talk about like rights and stuff and it's like. You may not like it here, you know but nobody's throwing you off for like a roof, because you can't practice your sexuality, I mean like you don't have to worry about being hung from a crane. Or you know pulled into the street and killed with rocks you don't have to worry about any of that stuff here so just some harsh language, maybe and some hurt feelings, but then you get on with the rest of your day you know what I mean so. I laugh a lot when I watched watch the news and watching people like get all crazy and it's like you're lucky you could even do that because in other countries is dragging the street and kill you. speak against the government or. You know, like like i'd have to agree with everything you said you know but. I appreciate that you're allowed to do it, you know what I mean like it's cool, though I don't agree with it, but you are allowed to say and that's why I love so it's fine you know it works, but people very sensitive out on the way."
15345.0,Patient,"Yes, they are very."
724.0,Provider,"kind of silly silly silly about the things that they will like which hills they're willing to die on for like ideology and you're like nobody's really fighting you on a lot of this stuff. And you're just fighting with yourself like it's cool but kind of wasting your time, everything is cool nobody there's no judgment everybody, do you want and it's like two to one. So, are you currently working now."
15345.0,Patient,No i'm not working right now.
724.0,Provider,Okay um how long ago were you employed or how long you been unemployed.
15345.0,Patient,i'm. Two months now okay.
724.0,Provider,And what were you doing before this.
15345.0,Patient,I was a health and wellness coordinator for. house the grace. residential services.
724.0,Provider,um. And you left that job because he wanted to focus on.
15345.0,Patient,"I had to get better i'm like I have to get better. Because i'm taking, you know as a nurse I take care of other people right and. If i'm not okay I can't take care of other people and I don't want to risk my license working while i'm fucked up and. i'm making a mistake because i'm fucked up and. I will I worked with a lot of people when I worked with the D odd so a lot of people who had developmental disabilities. And I was in these people's homes. You know I just I didn't want to do that I didn't want to."
724.0,Provider,yeah there's a lot of pressure there.
15345.0,Patient,"It was a whole lot of pressure and it even brought out my mental illness even more in the my anxiety, I would say the anxiety side of it because I was stressed like how am I. How am I doing this and I don't even deserve this title and I just I was like I have to get better like right now I can't do this, I have to get better first, before I put myself in a position, like that."
724.0,Provider,"All right, well good again you're making all the right you got tremendous insight so and you work in the healthcare field so you're very informed, and I know that that coming into a program like this is hard you know what I mean to commit to."
15345.0,Patient,"This because people are very judgmental. But they don't realize that I could be. Everybody has problems so that's what I. have known myself anyway, like it's okay like to have not be okay so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it's a huge first step, I can I commend you for it because and i'm like a broken record, because I have like a canned speech that I gave everybody at this point. Because it is at this level of care we call it like Level one it's the lowest level of care, not that it's the lowest level of care that you receive but it's the lowest level of in your face supervision management you run I mean it's like most people that come in programs like this. They pretty much have their shit together and a lot of areas that you would need to have housing occupation relationship. You know, on the surface, most people are pretty normal like like if you had to look at it from a from the background they'd have normal situations where there, they are still in a lot of control right. So that's good That means that we you're stable enough that we can provide you with medication and controlled substances and not have to worry about. You not showing back up or just off off the rails, you know what I mean so it's like you don't receive the lowest level of care it's, just like the lowest level of supervision that we have to provide for you, because you're already. In the right frame of mind, you know for this this level i've had people where i've done this assessment and i've gotten 15 minutes into it i'm like you don't qualify for this level of care, you just don't. feel like you're you're in a trap house right now. Address right. You don't know where you got to be it's more it's like i'm not comfortable. You probably need a higher level of care and for sure. Like the prescribers and our doctors are not going to give you a medication, you know what I mean and just let you off into the world like that's not how it works here it's like this. This is for people that are pretty stable, you know and a lot of areas and can be even more stable, you know provided you know they engage the treatment and the medication it's like a lot of people that requirements is like you know. 10 to 15 hours of bulk of their treatment, you know what I mean it's like some people need to be accountable, every day, you know what I mean it's like so you need a higher level of care, so this is a, this is a big step up. And the point of me telling you this is that you're already ahead of all that other drama that other people are face if you don't need an intensive care you don't need intensive IP or. hospitalization or detox you know, like you're at a point where you're you're you're in the right place, I mean you're literally on vacation right now, and your treatments so it's like."
15345.0,Patient,I know and everybody's getting pissed at me they're like what.
724.0,Provider,"So. don't so don't beat yourself up. don't have any guilt or shame in this like we carry enough guilt and shame and recovery, as it is so you do the right stuff for you. And this should help a lot of it when it comes to opiate dependency. Once the people get out of the fog and they get to that that chemical dependency part where it's like I can't function without it my body will not allow it to function without it, I get dope sick if i'll get high anymore, not having a good time and I do this. they're already in the right place, so the suboxone in the medication that that will give you will help you. stabilize it will help you make like maintain and eventually will help you get off this stuff and you won't need any of this anymore, you know what I mean so and in the meantime. As that being your end goal you're going to learn some shit about yourself to and will process that too, and then eventually you'll just be a more. sharp individual and you'll have a little bit more insight than you did when you initially came here so. it's a good program with all the Level one programs that I worked in and that people like you, that were pretty stable and this had some like natural human hiccups that they're trying to work through in a little periods, they they all tend not to turn out pretty good so."
15345.0,Patient,All right.
724.0,Provider,"So, other than that housing is your housing at home is that stable."
15345.0,Patient,No yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay. perfect and do you have like a stable support network any friends or peers, that you can reach out to hang out with that are not in Code, the various things are helping."
15345.0,Patient,"I do, I actually just started hanging out this girl. She doesn't know that i'm on suboxone but she's in a suboxone. Oh nice oh i've been thinking about opening up to her because i'm very reserved I don't tell anybody my business. um but i'm thinking about it, I really like her, so."
724.0,Provider,"sorry to have some vulnerability, it might expand your guys like relationship, but don't but focus on what got you guys together as a like whatever attracted you guys who each other that become friends, because what i've. experienced. A lot of people in recovery, especially like an Inpatient programs or even like outpatient if they have to go like daily is they make friends with other people in the Program. But then when they leave it's like the only thing that they had in common with each other, was that they were in a program. Right, so the nun relationship becomes very strange, you know. So it's like. Most of your personal childhood friends it's because you have some shared experience and some common interest. Which is why then you guys meet you can afford to have shared experiences where it's like in treatments, like the only thing you and I really have in common is that we, like pain pills."
15345.0,Patient,"And now, right now, what do we have and it's."
724.0,Provider,"Like I don't even know you. Know right it's like so it just becomes like this weird dynamic so part of me wants you to be open about you being on the medication, but the other part, wants me to. You to hold off in it improve that relationship and then at the end you know what I mean when it gets to like a real good point to where it's super stable where you'll have more things to talk about other than just being on suboxone you know I mean so it's just one of those things. I really don't know what kind of advice to give people. play by ear like I got I need people like in the when I worked in patient. groups of people and they were really good friends and they're awesome when they were like in the program and then, when they when they left they were just like. Like it just got awkward and I like seeing that I was like I felt bad as a like rob themselves like probably a meaningful relationship, but. Because it was, like all drug related and and part of like the the na na cadences like or tenants is like changer people places and things, but you know your people in your places in your things are always the same thing, but it's like you're not really changing that. Little stuff just weird."
15345.0,Patient,"stupid, but. Are we almost done, because I know I made people get out of my car i'm like I gotta do this meeting."
724.0,Provider,"Good we're just at the hour mark, which is typically how long this process takes we're good."
15345.0,Patient,"Oh, my God made him some of us, I for an hour."
724.0,Provider,"No, I appreciate it, it was nice meeting you i'm sorry."
15345.0,Patient,"tons of kids and it was like I have to check in 20 minutes, for I think the last time there was a hiccup I checked in but I sat in a breakout room for 20 minutes and then my time I got you. He was obviously on to somebody else because it was half hour later."
724.0,Provider,"But you know. I don't really wait about 15 minutes and then like and then I shut it down. And touch with the assessments, because they take a long time and it's like I need more than."
15345.0,Patient,"Well, it was them getting me to a to a care coordinator and the port care coordinator took that long to get to me so, but it was. My next appointment, can I call in and set that up."
724.0,Provider,"yep so if you're going to check in tomorrow is, you have a you have a doctor's appointment, this week, he said."
15345.0,Patient,"yeah I do tomorrow, I have a meeting and a plan which only."
724.0,Provider,cool so when you call in tomorrow have them scheduled you a follow up with me. Okay okay.
15345.0,Patient,"All right, awesome."
724.0,Provider,"awesome well enjoy. bye. All right, for transcription That was the psychosocial assessment for Robin male. she's here, primarily for opiate dependency. She was taking pills and storing them. And within the past 30 days up until the point that she got prescribe suboxone with us. A little history with experimental use for cocaine. Some eth history, but nothing significant she smokes about a pack to pack and a half a day tobacco. Some mental health diagnosis is is depression, anxiety ptsd and ADHD I encourage her to follow the chili cane, and maybe see about ADHD assessment for adult because she. She may have had on diagnose ADHD is a child, especially might want to look into that no history of suicidal attempts she's had passive thoughts. But no active plan or motivation to to complete it just as a secondary or fleeting thought. So she's at low risk for that she's gonna contact Karen as tomorrow when she checks in with her appointments for group and her doctor to do a follow up with me a couple of weeks, no further action steps."
