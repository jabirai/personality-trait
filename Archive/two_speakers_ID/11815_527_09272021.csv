527.0,Provider,Have you been have you guys been having more conflicts recently.
11815.0,Patient,um I wouldn't know because it's not like he's going to tell me so maybe deep inside he thinks I suck or something but he's not gonna tell me.
527.0,Provider,Are you guys talking at all.
11815.0,Patient,"yeah like last night I told them. i've seen the devil in Armenia, a couple of times. And then he asked me what it looked like and. Oh, design and how many times. Then I said there's a difference between the devil and the demons. And he said what's the difference my told them. i'm like but I don't believe in the traditional demon and God it's it's so I just told them it's a. they're like some similarities, but it's not a traditional one. And he asked me how and I told them. I fell asleep."
527.0,Provider,What do you feel like he doesn't understand at this point with you.
11815.0,Patient,Might not understand that I fall apart and try to keep it together.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11815.0,Patient,"Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't understand but feels like he doesn't understand. he likes to argue with me that, like it's not his fault, whatever happens, and at this point i'm like it's not. because every time I make a criticism, I could criticize them. Even when I do it calmly i've tried calmly a different tone. is like well it wouldn't be you if you had nothing to complain about right. Now."
527.0,Provider,What do you what are you learning about yourself.
11815.0,Patient,I think i'm a romantic and that's like not a good thing to be. Too emotional when I see a pretty tree or whatever the. Whatever is gay that is me.
527.0,Provider,"Because you know we've been we've been working, a few months together now Sarah and and just definitely have. You know, opened up a lot of a lot of things in life with you, and you know, abuse and trauma and just emotions that you didn't necessarily recognize or know were there, and so. You know, things have definitely shifted over the last few months, so. I didn't know if that was you know just trying to you know really explore who you've been underneath you know kind of how you are. You mask mask a lot of lot of things kind of came across says, you know I got this together and i'm tough and nothing's gonna bother me but underneath it you've got you had you know you've got a lot of different emotions there and. Things that yeah me need in your in your marriage and in your in your life for yourself."
11815.0,Patient,"yeah mom i'm learning more from my son seeing my myself and my son, that I am. i'm really sensitive. i'm very, very sensitive and. When i've been sensitive it not it didn't turn out well in situations because it's not like I was protected. and When you know, so I started to act tough."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11815.0,Patient,"And so I started thinking on this like tough thing when i'm actually really sensitive and. It goes back and forth, you know when I opened the door to go outside i'm tough. Come back home i'm sensitive but there's always in my family somebody who doesn't like. That i'm sensitive or has issues with it, so I have to pretend like i'm tough at home to. Now it's like it's always been the same thing and it's. And i'm just confused I don't know. i'm just confused."
527.0,Provider,about what particularly.
11815.0,Patient,Where can I be sensitive where it's a safe place to be sensitive.
527.0,Provider,"and wonder, too, if your husband's struggling with the changes that you're making. You know that, because he's known you for so long as. You know, responding in a certain way, you know with with your emotions and communication and and you've. been working on that the last few months and making a lot of changes in that area and so i'm wondering if he's having a hard time understanding like this, this may be more of who you are, you know, like being being more. Connected to your emotions. And needing to be able to have them and feel safe expressing them."
11815.0,Patient,I don't think he likes it I don't think he wants.
527.0,Provider,Well it's different it's definitely different than how you've been in the past.
11815.0,Patient,"i've shown them my emotions he knows i'm emotionally sensitive. I just don't think he wants me to be that. For too long, like he he kind of like puts a stamp timestamp on it like this is how much you're allowed to. Other than that, like you're not allowed to go any further."
527.0,Provider,"woody, what do you think he needs to hear them out of that for you."
11815.0,Patient,What do you mean.
527.0,Provider,Like. Like that you need time like there's not a time limit on your like expression of emotion.
11815.0,Patient,"yeah he's. He pretty much thinks that i'm too much. to handle and he's got work to do, he doesn't have time to. deal with it. He says. it's true he says he's got work to do and someone's got to pay the bills."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm true so when do you guys make time for yourselves is.
11815.0,Patient,"Well, he looks at houses. And I mean there's a lot of times, where I catch him looking at houses, instead of doing work but. If I say something to him will. jump down my throat."
527.0,Provider,Are you guys looking for a different place to live.
11815.0,Patient,"yeah. it's not possible right now so. And then he would look at like really expensive places to where i'm like stop looking at it does not attainable. And then. when everything is done during the day I live down, and I look at like pimple popping videos just kind of soothing to me. and that's our time to ourselves, I guess. He looks at stuff on the computer and and I will get stuff on my phone. But it's a little irritating that he does that during work or during the day, instead of afterwards. and afterwards, he just plays crosswords on his phone. I tried to be a soldier, I guess, in my whatever i'm doing. And I guess. The only time he Soldiering on is when there's a lot of work to do. Okay, but there's like one day is like me, you know medium amount of work to do, like he's in his office like looking in the houses that are expensive, or whatever. Just stupid I call I call it porn you know, whatever he does and i'm like. You know, instead of watching porn maybe you should continue doing shit so I need help and then he'll snap admin whatever. It wouldn't be me if I don't have it was like it wouldn't be it's not something to complain about he says it wouldn't be if I have something to criticize about him or whatever. Then I tell them, he should be able to handle criticism like an adult but. You know. it's very childish."
527.0,Provider,But it sounds like you're having difficulty handling his criticisms that he brings to you.
11815.0,Patient,Like what.
527.0,Provider,"Like you. You know, like you, needing to get things done, and just not be so emotional and things like that so. It sounds. Does it go do you guys kind of instigate it back and forth with each other, do you feel like."
11815.0,Patient,"No, I agree with them. I do. I know that I know that it's impossible. I know that I should be criticized."
527.0,Provider,is why yeah.
11815.0,Patient,"I just can't handle a lot of stuff I guess that somehow some super humans can or I just and less than an average person, because I can't handle certain things. I don't know. I don't know. confusing."
527.0,Provider,"So it sounds like maybe trying to get trying to organize what needs to be done, and where you need help. so that you can take care of your own mental health to through this process."
11815.0,Patient,sure.
527.0,Provider,"I mean how serious, are you sorry, as far as thinking about your son going to daycare for maybe a couple days a week."
11815.0,Patient,I don't know it makes me uncomfortable.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11815.0,Patient,"We took them playing and. And like there was this about eight year old girl who, just like took an interest in them, and she was just like really touchy feely with them and it just it bothered me and. Now i'm even more uncomfortable about stuff like that. I was telling Scott my husband, I was like he. Is preschool is there is there, eight girls desert people, older than him and he's like no his people his age, I was like okay okay. i'm like it's always there and he's like yeah they always have their eyes on them, they never take their eyes off of. Make sure you jump causative. And then, like a we went to speech therapy today and. They love him and they're just like wow he's the most beautiful boy in the world and look at his eyes and his beautiful hair and this and this i'm like in my head i'm like yeah so he's molesting molest level, but everyone and i'm like great Fuck like. I don't want to take my eye off of him if he's like that Q and that one girl, just like took an interest in and it's not just going to be one girl it's like I I need to know that he's safe I need to know that the right adults have his eye on that on him and their eye on him. When I was in kindergarten and adult left the classroom I remember these kids got together and portrait this one little kid. And otter wanted."
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah yeah I definitely wouldn't want that either, but you definitely have some some memories of experiences that are you know that get triggered for you."
11815.0,Patient,"Yes, that's why I get uncomfortable and people like Oh, you know how about take care of sugar take a dog brown like I don't I don't know I don't think so."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you don't feel safe doing that that's totally fine what are some things that we need to implement at home that give you a little more structure and schedule and breaks throughout the day for you and some support."
11815.0,Patient,yeah just need another adult I trust to. be with them.
527.0,Provider,"I mean, is there anybody like do you have like a like a local college or anything where students, you know could could come to the home and and watch him, while you're doing stuff with the House or you know. Taking a nap or whatever you want to do that, they watch your son for a couple hours in the House. And while you're here. yeah that may be something to think about you know, seeing what what options are available in the area. You know, because I know there's been. You know students here in my area, you know college students that do babysitting or you know, like nanny nanny type jobs, you know that are willing to you know they need money for school, you know so and they're adults, you know young adults, so they can play, and you know. Take care of the kids."
11815.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"And that might feel more comfortable, I know I, I know I did that you know when I was a teenager I had a had a woman, that I watched her son she worked she. Had a horse farm so she was out working the horses, while I would watch him, you know and play with him so that he wasn't in the way of her work."
11815.0,Patient,"it's just like. I don't like when people start talking to me too much and then like. I just feel like whoever it is going to come and they just start talking to me and i'm not I don't know her. be like no just you know, do you would think so I just answer, or whatever. And then, once they leave them like you know, like I don't want them here anymore, and I don't know how to make that clear. Like I looked for people to play backgammon with me because there's nobody to play backgammon. Online and I found. two ladies who play backgammon."
527.0,Provider,uh huh.
11815.0,Patient,"And it was cool they came over and. During the game like they start asking me a bunch of questions because i'm you know brown hair brown eyes so they're just like Oh, are you from and business. And I told them and then they're like Oh, and then this, and this was like okay I answer that too, and then again and again and again and and I was like I think after they left I looked at my husband and i'm like I don't want them to come back anymore."
527.0,Provider,What got too uncomfortable for you.
11815.0,Patient,I just want to play backgammon. Even had like you know snacks make you comfortable. yeah I was mad what's what's.
527.0,Provider,hard about people getting close to you or learning learning about you and and and it's all about what you want to share to sorry it's not you know it's not that you have to be an open book either.
11815.0,Patient,"I mean you can start, I see you. i'll write a freakin book and put it out there if they have freakin questions I don't care and i'll be honest with it too it's not my problem it's just that I want you to play backgammon with me that's what I look for. When I was searching I said I will I want somebody to play back mm. hmm you know what I mean like I don't, why are we here talking like oh i'll write a book and i'll post it out there and then on your way out, you can take the book and learn about me I don't care. You can joke around during the game like you know little things like it's a pretty aggressive game at times. Like buya or I got you haha you're down there time when you came to you even call me bitch while you I don't care we're here playing backgammon I don't know why I have to tell you about my life over and over again."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. Have you had many friends.
11815.0,Patient,"good friends, I have two really good friends."
527.0,Provider,"So, how did you get to be friends with them."
11815.0,Patient,Oh they've known me for a while. Sorry someone's calling. fam. they've known me for a while that's how i'm friends with people.
527.0,Provider,And so they probably asked you similar questions i'm guessing when they first met you and started to get to know you i'm guessing.
11815.0,Patient,"um no I was like high school and stuff. there's just kind of like they saw. enough to ask me. Like we we learned boundaries and stuff for a while, you know it's not like. So the boundaries would have been said. A while ago. yeah. But new friends. that's a tricky one."
527.0,Provider,"that's what I you you kind of put your walls up to not let let many people in and you've got a lot of interesting things and cool things about yourself. But it, but I know you kind of struggle with feeling confident about those things to for you."
11815.0,Patient,"it's more. Like. though they can know, whatever they want it's just. I guess the boundary thing. And they can say one thing that I don't like and i'm like I don't want to be friends with them anymore. yeah."
527.0,Provider,cuz cuz you've been hurt a lot by friends and people.
11815.0,Patient,"yeah like I, I have no problem dropping people."
527.0,Provider,I know.
11815.0,Patient,"I have no problem even dropping these friends, I don't like the ones that i've known for a while and I love them. But I have no problem dropping them because I don't want to cry about anybody for a second. I don't want to cry for them, for even like a drop of my tears should not go for them."
527.0,Provider,Why is that.
11815.0,Patient,So a lot of energy that I can. Like I already am energy list I don't I don't I can't afford the.
527.0,Provider,But at the same time i'm wondering if they could be a support for you.
11815.0,Patient,What do you mean.
527.0,Provider,"Because you could use the support. from someone. From a friend like instead of you, you being in the position to to you know offer support to them, you know, maybe that maybe they need to jump in and be more of a support right now to you."
11815.0,Patient,"know I don't feel comfortable, because I think this is a lot of them notice this. it's. Like my parents really dug in deep about the whole like see what i'm doing for you. Okay, like. Anything a small thing done for me was just like see what i'm doing for you don't you forget that i'm doing this for you see what i'm doing for you, do you know how many people out there don't do that for their kids. see what i'm doing for you did you see what I did for you, and then they could mess up like a million times worse. and take more money from me than they've ever given me and not money, but like, if you like. Get the stuff together to you know if you want to calculate the money spent on me, I could give them more and those still be like Do you know what i've done for you it's like. All right, so I kind of don't. Like that when people do stuff for me then i'm just like indebted forever. Like even if it's mutual. mm hmm I still feel like I owe them something. I don't like feeling that."
527.0,Provider,"What if you just Oh, being a friend to somebody and they and that's all they owe you as being a friend to you like there's nothing more than that."
11815.0,Patient,"Well, no, because they have to drive to certain places that's money and energy. You know, they have to sit there and listen that's energy and."
527.0,Provider,that's. It but that's stuff you do to like it's a back and forth.
11815.0,Patient,yeah but for some reason it's never enough what I do.
527.0,Provider,Because your parents said you were never enough.
11815.0,Patient,"You know, look at that person next door there's so much better than me. Look at. Look at so and so who's going to UCLA and I can't even get my shit together, whatever. yeah well if I if I had your talent i'd be driving all day that's not how it works okay thanks."
527.0,Provider,So where do we even begin to start kind of changing that negative self talk for you.
11815.0,Patient,"it's not negative self talk I just don't want to be in the situation where they're telling me there's so much i've done for you kind of think I had a friend who did that, like. I paid rent I bought stuff. I, I said that I did it so much. And at the end, I was like you know, like I love the show third rock from the sun and I bought and I bought the whole thing the season package and. She decided to put her initials and my initials on it, I was like whatever because whatever is mine is hers and whatever is hers in his mind, but that didn't so funny one that didn't work out that way eventually. And I was like well I. You know i'm like i'm going to leave, and I do one thing that I want is my my third rock from the sun that's All I want."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11815.0,Patient,"And she said no. straight up like that known. As like you're not going to give me my. My favorite show like are you crazy she's like that's not as not just yours, and I was like yes it is mm hmm. And she didn't give it to me so when I left I straight up pack my things and I walked out and she screamed the after me she's like you're so ungrateful i've done so much for you. I was like man, I can never felt when. I can't even get a frickin show. Like I can't even get my show no matter what I do for people, no matter how much I give no matter the energy spent it's still that tiny thing that you did, for me, is so much it can't compare to the grand things that i've done for you."
527.0,Provider,yeah wow. Really unfair.
11815.0,Patient,"yeah I do that unfair thing a lot and then another thing I did is life is unfair, deal with it so i'm like all right well it's, not that I can't win it's just I keep losing. Its I get this point, I didn't even want to win it's just can I not lose all the time, there will be fucking great."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11815.0,Patient,So I. So I make up for it thinking i'm the shit I do I think i'm the ship there's a stone away i'm surviving is I think i'm freaking awesome.
527.0,Provider,But you don't believe it.
11815.0,Patient,I don't know i'm confused like I said i'm confused have no freakin idea.
527.0,Provider,"So how about we put some energy into you taking care of you are you up for that. That doesn't sound real convincing as. Well, I mean, I think you need to be fair to yourself and in take care of you. Like you deserve that too. yeah you can do nice things for others, but at the end of the day, you need to make yourself a priority to. Because if you're not taking care of yourself you're you're going to where you're you're you're seeing it you're wearing down you're not doing well emotionally physically. You know your relationship wise, you know it's all it's you're struggling and all the areas and so yeah I think we need to make a priority for you and. And follow through with it and be consistent with it, not just i'm going to try it today and I didn't do so hot so just forget it and throw it out the door, I think we need to keep working at it."
11815.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,"So what would be an area that you feel like you want to focus on first you want to focus on. Just physically being able to take care of yourself better you know, and I think it may go hand in hand, you know if you're taking care of yourself physically better. You know, getting sleep getting you know nutrition getting some movement, you know that's going to help your emotional health to they're going to kind of go hand in hand, but I think really kind of adding some structure to your day so that it's intentional care for yourself to. And having your yeah and also helping your husband understand. That this. This is a priority to for not only you. But it's going to help relationships with with you and him and with your son, you know if you're taking care of yourself and. And it is different and challenging because you're starting to identify more emotions that you have an express them differently than you have, and you need his support and helping you do that."
11815.0,Patient,"I mean, do you want to know how I feel."
527.0,Provider,I do yeah.
11815.0,Patient,I don't give a Fuck about his support.
527.0,Provider,Which is probably making it hard to live in the same home i'm guessing.
11815.0,Patient,"them and they'll be like go to Dan has the cutest his head i'll go kiss them, you know he's got a nice head. And i'll have them he doesn't do that for me."
527.0,Provider,He doesn't do it back to you. Has he ever.
11815.0,Patient,yeah when he feels bad or somebody reminds him.
527.0,Provider,did he do it before you guys got married.
11815.0,Patient,eating. He did he doesn't do it for years and then he does it I think cuz he's scared that. they're men interested in me.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I know you've mentioned, maybe having to do some marital therapy is that is that a priority now I mean for you to take care of yourself like to know that you've. you're trying to work on this marriage."
11815.0,Patient,I don't think that's priority right now. i've tried to a point where i'm like I don't care about that one anymore at least right now.
527.0,Provider,Just to focus on you right now. yeah.
11815.0,Patient,"I mean he's a good husband so i've seen really not seen, but my experiences, this is the best I can do."
527.0,Provider,"Well i'm not a marriage and family therapist so I can't counsel you on that end, but we can work on things for yourself. Well it'd be a good goal to focus on over the next couple of weeks."
11815.0,Patient,Be more active.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, what would that look like, what do you feel like you can do."
11815.0,Patient,yeah maybe like write down a list of things I need to do during the day cuz I get overwhelmed and I don't know. What to do in a moment.
527.0,Provider,"yeah that's what i'm you know i'm wondering if maybe trying to come up with some sort of structure schedule for yourself during the day. and being able to you know recognize if you're putting a lot of stuff on one day, and then you have fewer stuff on another day you know, trying to find a balance for yourself. So maybe think about coming up with like a weekly schedule. You know, like what Monday Monday through Friday looks like what Saturday and Sunday looks like. In where you want to integrate some some movement for yourself or activity for yourself in in throughout the day."
11815.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. and, obviously, you know, probably the weekends, are a little more flexible, because i'm guessing your husband doesn't work as much on the weekends or doesn't work on the weekends. yeah so you know the weekends, maybe a lot more flexible, but maybe maybe putting you know some intentional things in through the week during the work week. And then maybe seeing where there's areas where he can help kind of pick up things, even if it's for like 30 minutes of you know, watching the baby and and you go take a 30 minute walk outside or whatever it may be, so that you know you're you're taking care of yourself."
11815.0,Patient,I agree.
527.0,Provider,"And, and I think your voices is important to hear to sorry I know that's been something that we've kind of been addressing is that you've not felt like your words matter or that you've been heard. By people you know just kind of."
11815.0,Patient,"I don't want to hear me man. Learning thing about it. I don't know what it is maybe it's my fault, but maybe it's the way I am nobody wants to hear me. They don't. I don't know what it is."
527.0,Provider,"Do you think it's more of the tone that comes across and what you're saying, or is it. Or is it just your thoughts just ingrained that my words don't matter, nobody wants to hear what I have to say, because that's what you kind of kind of heard growing up. Like just be quiet."
11815.0,Patient,"No it's not just be quiet, either as I still try like oh. i'll try to. say things and then, when nobody like cares or here's me i'll raise my voice, and then they really don't care here man and i'm like."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11815.0,Patient,"I can just keep trying. Okay, I have a I have a trick up my sleeve I just say that that's what Scott said, and then people are just like i'm sorry we're. Mostly cool cool. If their intention. I would do that with my friends too and they're finally starting to hear me like one of them she's a she's to work with. She was a social worker she's to it work with kids. are like psychology degree, yes, used to be a third on all it's the therapist and think. Our counselor and she she used to work with like gang members and stuff. and She figured out what I do and now she feels she felt really bad because she thought that she she really like failed me and stuff like that, and I have to tell her Scott is saying something. And now finally our relationship is different, like she likes hearing me talk. So now she listens to me like when I say."
527.0,Provider,Good.
11815.0,Patient,"yeah. And she actually helps like to with activities she's like let's go do this and let's go to that she's always doing stuff even when she's tired she's like you know she's taking her family here and there, she's. she's always prepared like she's she's more like a mother than I am. And I mean she's loved me forever like, no matter where I left for years, and she didn't see me she always found me through people and she pulled them to tell me to call her, no matter what country or state amen. So. I don't know I think she loves me but. She said another human being, like I can't put her through that much."
527.0,Provider,"Well we're going to start with you. As and then we then we can add to your support system around you so did you begin to feel better about yourself and can trust yourself and build healthy relationships for yourself, because it sounds like some of them have been more one sided than two sided. Which that gets you a burn on wanting to keep friends or not keep friends."
11815.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're going to work on a schedule kind of coming up with some structure and schedule for for a week and then start adding some activity and for yourself that sound like a good place to start not not too overwhelming."
11815.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"And then, as far as just the thoughts, you know suicidal thoughts any thoughts today."
11815.0,Patient,"um it's not like i'm not planning i'm just like you know not existing must be so nice, because then you have no responsibilities. Okay yeah."
527.0,Provider,"But if you need to go the hospital can your husband gets you there you know where to go to the emergency room if you need to. yeah okay. Any thoughts to harm anybody else or self harm behaviors. No okay. All right, so we need to probably schedule some more. sessions here."
11815.0,Patient,"I think there's one scheduled after this. Oh i'm i'm gonna. Maybe some morrow is my last. day I can't. I can't do. group therapy anymore, because it's super expensive. it's like $90 at therapy and just a lot."
527.0,Provider,It is.
11815.0,Patient,"So it ends up being like what. 360 a month. You know, plus I do individually, but i'd rather have individual then group, because I get more funding for jewel."
527.0,Provider,"All right, well we're gonna have to talk about that those are because you're supposed to do group that's part of the bright heart."
