323.0,Provider,I don't know if it's. Early so they may not yeah they may not have sent it yet usually around the 10th by the 10th are going out so there's few. days left so.
6863.0,Patient,yeah so probably next week sometime.
323.0,Provider,"Especially we're getting reported, they said that they're going to try to disperse them in smaller batches because we're getting all these reports that the mail is going to go slower. for whatever reason, so they're just trying to time it so that at least it gets they get delivered within the month."
6863.0,Patient,there's a lot going on in the world.
323.0,Provider,"really is, we have not bounced back at all. I don't know what its gonna look like when we do if we do."
6863.0,Patient,I think they opened up everything over to early just to get all that stimulus and all that summer money back.
323.0,Provider,well.
6863.0,Patient,that's my opinion and everybody just. Back to getting sick. Right now it's sober and. Now we got the flu when a. whole bunch of other stuff out there.
323.0,Provider,And there's this whole like Labor shortage which is just a weird thing to me I don't know where all these people are. I get it that there's some fear of not wanting to go back into like you know service industry hospitality that kind of stuff but.
6863.0,Patient,"yeah I think there were saying the unemployment was kind of Okay, I think, within a couple weeks ago it was on the rise, so he's got to watch what news you watch I was the world news, or you know. ABC news."
323.0,Provider,yeah because they all spend it very differently. yeah and.
6863.0,Patient,My local news is kind of a little little funny like i'll watch 11 and there'll be totally different than 13 movie. You know it's.
323.0,Provider,"And sometimes they're in complete contradiction just something very different. Right Oh, it is pretty crazy. So when are you when do you think, like you, are you do, you have thoughts about your next trip to see your mom or what's the plan in terms of her care and you keeping up with it."
6863.0,Patient,"We probably won't be able to go down there for maybe at least least a few months. It would be nice to probably go down there sooner, but. Hopefully, everything just stays you know. Okay, for now, and."
323.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, I think it sounds like it's great that she's responding to the shots."
6863.0,Patient,that's how doing.
323.0,Provider,medical condition now I just figured them figuring out what's going on sounds like her lungs that's something going on.
6863.0,Patient,yeah we don't know why she's got this cough.
323.0,Provider,And it's not pneumonia. Brian I mean they ruled that out so. yeah crazy.
6863.0,Patient,matson the mind.
323.0,Provider,"yeah, how do you manage and even from a distance, I mean you seem better last time you saw or you were really upset took a while, for you to kind of settle back in how are you managing this time just in terms of."
6863.0,Patient,Just dealing with the talking about it.
323.0,Provider,Only can only control what.
6863.0,Patient,You can control right.
323.0,Provider,yeah. Does your aunt is like is your answer resource for you in terms of getting like accurate accurate information.
6863.0,Patient,"Yes, okay. yeah different than yeah but there's something she's not saying, or something you know. or get told you know what's really going on."
323.0,Provider,"So at least that's good, because you know that you'll get. The real view, eventually, even if mom's not sharing it."
6863.0,Patient,"I just hope it all goes, you know just. She needs another 20 years you know she deserves it. Surely does."
323.0,Provider,"sounds like it would be, I mean it would be a sad outcome yeah and too soon."

6863.0,Patient,ritual talk every day so. yeah that's good yeah. Trying to do the best with relationship anyways.
323.0,Provider,"And then that context important i'm sure she looks forward to it, I know you do. So that's really important it's part of her healing you know, making sure the families okay that she's appreciated and loved and."
6863.0,Patient,Being there mentally is a lot.
323.0,Provider,"it's very significant part of health and trying to push yourself into you know through recovery. Is the mental part of that yeah. Because when you mentally give up if you can't bring the body, you know I mean the body just kind of will start to shut down so i'm happy to hear she's not there. Right so."
