107.0,Provider,"Sure, so what we're going to be doing is working on an assessment understanding kind of what's been going on with you in terms of behaviors and maybe emotionally and different things like that so. I don't know how comfortable, you are and having your dad present the whole time that is your decision to make not mine. So it's up to you to decide if you want him to be around for everything I will ask you some pretty involved questions in order for me to be able to. create an assessment for your insurance company to understand the appropriate level of care for you, based on how things are going, or not going. Okay. ready. Okay. I need."
17072.0,Patient,To be in this meeting.

Okay alright, so we are here to talk about what's going on with you and your body and your mental state and food.

107.0,Provider,Six months okay so prior to that life was hunky dory no feelings of depression or. anxiety body was not an issue. Okay. And so what changed in April.
17072.0,Patient,"i'm not too sure, I think, because covered I wasn't seeing my friends are often than I became like really self absorbed by myself, so I started. I became more self aware and I started finding that didn't like."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you say April, I think I was thinking this year were you talking last year 2020 do I miss that."
17072.0,Patient,"Oh no, I think it was this year 2020."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, but we're still kind of feeling like cove it's been an issue in terms of you being able to sit to started wearing on you, at that point. Yes, okay so looking at your survey results your depression score is the six and your anxiety scores is seven so both of those are kind of mild moderate mild for the anxiety moderate for the depression. Does that kind of strike you as being correct that depression is you've got a little bit of sadness, but you're a little bit more agitated than you are sad."
17072.0,Patient,yeah Sam i'm much more interested I am said.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you been seeing a therapist at all, or a dietitian or talk to your doctor about any of these things."

107.0,Provider,And then i'm.
17072.0,Patient,Like a fitness Center that's open at my school and I go there too.
107.0,Provider,And how often would you say you're exercising how many hours a day.
17072.0,Patient,"um well I walk to school, every day, so that's a good 45 minutes there and back then. Okay, most."
107.0,Provider,Okay.
17072.0,Patient,"Well, at least, like 45 minutes to an hour a day and."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
17072.0,Patient,"I say, maybe, maybe two hours because I. have my classes for strength on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And then go to the gym or the fitness thing with my friends on the other days."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so you think about two hours a day you're exercising Okay, and then, can you walk me through a typical day of eating for you like, what do you have for breakfast you have breakfast snacks what kind of things do we all that good stuff."
17072.0,Patient,"um breakfast I usually just have cereal and milk like cheerios and the almond milk and then. I have lunch, and I have the school lunch, which is like a like a chicken. With like salad and like these me news. I usually pack to crackers along with that. After school I do my like sports or whatever, and then I back banana and then for dinner I have. I have, like the ball you over. Your ricotta she's."
107.0,Provider,"quite a bit yeah Okay, and are you eating the snacks a pack."
17072.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,"So okay so none of that sounds as anything that I have concerns about our stand out, are you eating in the middle of the night or sneaking food or anything like that. Are you back. All right, good deal, so I was just asking, are you eating in the middle of the night or sneaking snacks or any additional food throughout the day or in at nighttime when no one's around."
17072.0,Patient,"Usually wait I don't think i've ever done that, before. We don't really count fruits or. A snack of a fruit or vegetables, but yeah she does she does that you don't have a piece of fruit, like everything very healthy and low calories for sure, but um you know definitely nothing. and Nothing that makes her feel bad after a while."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then what kind of behaviors are we talking about what kinds of stuff is going on, then in terms of food."
17072.0,Patient,um I just I think so restrictive I don't eat like like I was a cake and I don't eat a slice of cake for the party.
107.0,Provider,"So do you have food rules are there, certain foods you're just not gonna allow yourself to eat."
17072.0,Patient,"um I want to say their I guess their rules, but I don't think I like really recognize that I just say that I don't really want to eat it with an eye. Okay, to eat it because I know that I can't allow myself to yeah I can eat anything I just I just can't do it."
107.0,Provider,"Okay So what are the kinds of foods, you can eat cake at a birthday."
17072.0,Patient,yeah i'm targeting like sweets like brownies or cookies and stuff like that. Like a lot of like brett's stuff. Oh yeah me. I like chicken and fish.
107.0,Provider,And eggs okay. But not red meat.
17072.0,Patient,yeah and I guess like a lot on like the process like like fruit roll ups or things like you see in packages.
107.0,Provider,mm hmm. So what about the crackers that you get are those different.
17072.0,Patient,"yeah i'm kind of just like. What would you call them. Creating. An advisor you're so cute very cute ones, no, no, I don't know what they are, I feel like. My dad call some hardcore crackers. taste very good very. Good but then, like the weak ones like that."
107.0,Provider,"Okay. So when you go to the grocery store do you kind of get your own cart and that I hear that correctly you're kind of buying your own stuff or at least. Setting up your own stuff. Do you have your own like little cabinet of stuff that this is my food, nobody else is allowed to eat it or nobody else wants to eat it so healthy."
17072.0,Patient,"Is my. I have my little cabinet I think everyone likes food I just say eat all of it not allowed to touch it, but we just respect that she has you know, like 108 o'clock or something like rather eat the bread and stuff. I don't mind it but. top of it he's he's growing his twin brother."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. does not have any food issues, no. He said he can't get enough of it."
17072.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
107.0,Provider,"it's easy growing kid okay. got it okay. Okay, so do you ever chew your food and spit it out. yeah right. How when you used to do that how often would you do it."
17072.0,Patient,um three four times a day.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, do you ever take any teas or laxatives diuretics anything like that to help you the bathroom."
17072.0,Patient,drink a lot of water.
107.0,Provider,"You drink a lot of wire, how much is a lot of water."
17072.0,Patient,glasses.
107.0,Provider,A day or every time you eat something oh.
17072.0,Patient,"Well, when I used to do it when he, like feel guilty about what am I drink two glasses of water after I eat a meal. Like five to six classes, a day on average."
107.0,Provider,Okay okay and. Did you how what's the longest amount of time you've gone without eating.
17072.0,Patient,Good day.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and how often does that happen."
17072.0,Patient,"i'm not anymore, and I have been the last two months."
107.0,Provider,"But before the last two months, how often would it happen."
17072.0,Patient,Oh i'm not that often I always I always eat like. chicken or something or something small.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, but where you would have very little or nothing to eat, how many days was that before."
17072.0,Patient,Probably like consecutively for like two three months.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so in that time period, did you lose a lot of weight. Yes, okay so."
17072.0,Patient,"Oh, did you get the numbers of."
107.0,Provider,"yeah I got the numbers and so i'm just just checking so is that was a pretty substantial amount of weight in six months. rather alarming actually. Not in a good way. So, because then you have to rule out my medical conditions and that's pretty scary right, which is why we're having this conversation. So at this point you're at the point where you've lost a lot of weight, what are your motivations in terms of paying attention to food and how you navigate it."
17072.0,Patient,I guess i'm just trying to like eat without like being guilty or whatever.
107.0,Provider,But you've spent a long time kind of being guilty and being very concerned about what you eat.
17072.0,Patient,"i'm. Actually, after the fact, after I eat, something I don't really feel guilt, I think, just. Being myself to eat, something is kind of difficult."
107.0,Provider,"Okay. So, once you commit to the idea of eating it's not terrible it's just the idea of eating is scary. Okay, and how long has that been the case, probably for since April or."
17072.0,Patient,"yeah i'd say, so I think it's calmed down since like two months ago."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so have you been able to have your menstrual period in the last couple of months yeah Okay, but was there a time period where you didn't."
17072.0,Patient,yeah um it was a bit hard to tell because it was.
107.0,Provider,Pretty a regular before okay okay.
17072.0,Patient,Like I think like four months right.
107.0,Provider,"Okay. So what is going to keep you on the path of eating healthy and or eating regularly and not worrying about it or feeling guilty, what do you think you need to do to help yourself. be better about food and not restrict."
17072.0,Patient,"um. I guess, can we if I if I surround myself with like a lot of people like my friends are eating lunch it's like easier because I see them eating lunch and I realized that it's not a bad thing."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so initially your motivation was that you weren't around your friends or you're worried about what your friends were thinking, and now you feel like that's the thing that's helping you."
17072.0,Patient,"i'd say so, I think I was really worried about how my friends so me it was more how I saw myself."
107.0,Provider,"So now, do you how do you see yourself."
17072.0,Patient,I don't know I think I see myself as healthier um. I want to say.
107.0,Provider,"So you lost about 50 pounds in six months that's a really extreme weight loss and i'm concerned about that developing some sort of pattern for you that when life starts feeling a little out of control you're going to really engage the restricting behaviors. In order to control life and feel better about things. So I think it would be very important for you to work with a therapist who understands eating disorders and can work with you on managing your anxiety because you resonate with your was it being stronger than your depression. and help you work on your food rules and how you manage your body. I don't know if the school counselor will be able to fit that bill because working with people who struggle with food is. A fairly specific. endeavor so probably makes more sense that it's a therapist who's trained in eating disorders and knows that, and then I would also recommend that you work with a dietitian to review your actual meal plan and your snacks and. and talk about how things are going, or not going in I think right now given everything it would make sense for you to meet with a therapist dietician weekly."
17072.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,well.
17072.0,Patient,"I am so my background was I was a sports dietitian so okay i've also worked with Jim does so well, is very much."
107.0,Provider,Okay.
17072.0,Patient,"I was you know we. We actually oddly enough, I was preparing her not to be at the state, since she was nine years old, because i've seen us go often."
107.0,Provider,yeah sure.
17072.0,Patient,No matter what I could do it was I just couldn't stop.
107.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no that's the frustrating part about it, right here, where there's a will there's a way."
17072.0,Patient,"So, but I think i'd like her, just to have another person she can talk to me. they're probably going to see the same thing as me but just to hear it ends differently when it's not dad. yeah and I think two people say the same thing is going to resonate more everything you said already she's heard already. Shared everything from you know, things are this thing last for long times these years."
107.0,Provider,"Yes, but yeah."
17072.0,Patient,Ladies again to get come back again yeah I mean i've seen it all work.
107.0,Provider,Oh i'm sure so. yeah.
17072.0,Patient,You know um so this just great to have somebody else. blackboard and something somebody. Without me as i'm sure you. Have any more comfortable without. So.
107.0,Provider,"Are there, what kind of resources do you guys have in your area because, again, the intention behind today's meeting is to. Do an assessment for the insurance company to say yes, this is what the recommendation is this is what needs to happen and so. Your insurance company i'll say you met with a certified eating disorder specialist, this is what this person recommends, so you will have that kudos do you feel like you have resources private in your immediate area. is much easier to tell a medicine. Okay yeah so."
17072.0,Patient,"We couldn't find any. Okay hospital and the financials wise, we, the current rate here in San Francisco just."
107.0,Provider,would not be fine yeah.
17072.0,Patient,"From what I think she needs, which is a weekly."
107.0,Provider,"Right yeah. Okay, so. Okay, so that's why I asked so that I can be specific and the recommendation that you need a a telemedicine option, where you can have Lee Lee individual sessions with somebody who is able to see adolescence and. And then also weekly dietary support, I think, at least for good. Two months, just to make sure that everything is aboveboard and then you can always step that down but it sounds like it, you know just let's just make sure everybody's on the same page and continuing to be on that page and. Okay i'm work through stuff so because, if things get out of hand, then we're looking at you know residential. you're not. living at home and you're in a program."
17072.0,Patient,"Because you're not willing to listen. Right yeah I can imagine was the case yeah. yeah well wait Luckily, the primary doctor. Okay, I agree that the reason why she was in this date was because she wasn't with friends and they were going to take her out the first week of school."
107.0,Provider,And so.
17072.0,Patient,It was a lot worse before school is so much. Better around. friends and colleagues to please.
107.0,Provider,Well that's good. So okay.
17072.0,Patient,Being around people is some fasting for her.
107.0,Provider,"Well that's great. that's great that's super knowing that and and use that strength to kind of pull together, do you are there any friends who can kind of rally if we start having struggling moments, who can kind of step in and help out."
17072.0,Patient,I think. I think like they think they like they know but.
107.0,Provider,"They don't so guess what I think it would be a really good idea for you to pick one or two people. and talk to them about it because right now them, not knowing allows you to keep a secret that's not safe for you to have. Because it's not that everybody needs to be in your business I don't agree with that, but there's maybe one or two people that you're really close with that you feel like you can be safe, with can you think of can you think of one or two people right now, maybe. Okay, and and you need to sit down with them, you need to talk to them about it and you need to have support, because if you're struggling in school you're struggling at a sporting event or. You start struggling at home, you need to, we need to rally the troops to help you feel better and to if that works and let's use it. It also won't give you permission to engage in behaviors it will be harder for you to justify it, because your friends, no. Do you worry about what they'll think of you."
17072.0,Patient,think so.
107.0,Provider,"I mean that it's understandable what what could they what could be some things that they would think about you, if you were to share with them, what are your worries."
17072.0,Patient,I think I think I just feel like I let them down and always.
107.0,Provider,"Okay well. it's you this isn't something to be. ashamed of you had your own reasons for why you decided to engage in this, you know from your dad and now you're hearing from me and probably from your doctor that it's not safe. for you to continue to be like this and to engage in these behaviors, so we need to rally the troops and bring your friends in so that you can hear from them that they care about you and that they want to support you. And that's what friends are, for if they were struggling when she want to be able to do that for them. yeah so it's just it's it's always easy to answer that question when it comes to supporting others it just feels really strange to do it for when we need support. So I think it would be another really good thing and that's something you can do right away. You know, you can do that in the next couple of days, and maybe talk to your dad and it's Okay, if you folks around. For those conversations, maybe that would be helpful, maybe it wouldn't be helpful, you have to make that decision, but let's take the secrecy away a little bit so that you have some people that know what's going on and how they can support you. it's hard with the virtual background I know it kind of gets in and out I."
17072.0,Patient,yeah I gotta raise mine I figured that out.
107.0,Provider,No worries you doing great. Does that make sense to kind of utilize that skill set since it's something you feel was so strong ernie to help. kind of provide extra support.
17072.0,Patient,"I think it's great so she the difference here is that it's a brand new school. Even However, she likes right now is really brand new. Oh, and so that's. A different school, but you don't you haven't communicated as much for them leak. Okay, so she's got some old friends she's been close with. Your head of department so."
107.0,Provider,yeah better. Better with the older friends. So maybe yeah.
17072.0,Patient,"They won't be around the school so maybe there's a sense you won't feel bad about. Knowing, so the school is very high school right now it's very, very small, I wanted to work. But there is also a lot of girls. That had the same issue, virtually."
107.0,Provider,Of course.
17072.0,Patient,"Our standing, it is a private school and happens to be. Very so she got a full scholarship to a really good school here in San. Great so. And I think that that school itself does have a lot of people, a lot of kids that get themselves pressures."
107.0,Provider,yep oh yeah.
17072.0,Patient,yeah because that kind of school.
107.0,Provider,yeah I hear you.
17072.0,Patient,it's a.
107.0,Provider,"So, having some outside support provide balance to some of the internal. there's a lot of amazing things i'm sure about that school, but with those environments, can also be a little bit crazy bless them, you know it's all good. And so, how do you balance that by staying connected, some of your older friends and and it would be good for you to stay connected to them. So i'm not saying you have your first conversation with them here's what's been going on with me, but maybe get reconnected to them make sure you're still feeling like you're solid friends and then talk to them about that. What do you think does that feel like a reasonable plan. Okay. Okay, so I love that you're going to do better with support, but then, if your friends start you know at school, if they start acting up and everybody's like Oh, in order for us to all be cool, we need to eat one carry today. and start advocating some sort of craziness who are you know how are we going to know about that who's who are you going to reach out to and tell that this is what's going on at school."
17072.0,Patient,We fall back on my dad again.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, the first one."
17072.0,Patient,"Like he knew about it, before I realized it because I didn't think I even have."
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
17072.0,Patient,"No way not we we saw it, for months, but we just couldn't get into the hospital in time. it's frustrating. Because uh yeah Colin when, let us go in and."
107.0,Provider,write.
17072.0,Patient,It was just tough. To see it reaches couldn't you know yeah yeah I know times are strange right now for sure okay.
107.0,Provider,"Well, so as long as you feel like you can talk to your dad about it, and you can be kind of aware. any type of toxic or unhealthy behaviors always does, better when we expose it and clean it and keep it, you know, open and we stay aware so. This is this is kind of a gross analogy, but it's like wound care, you know if you've ever had any like blisters or anything like that, where, if you let him stay in fester they get all nasty right versus if you treat them and take care of them you heal. So this is what you have to do you have to keep talking, you have to stay honest, you have to keep engaging this and then you can heal and just know this will always probably be. you've kind of set a precedence now and so now, you have to be aware that this is a potential. way that you will react to anxiety so it's important right now to stabilize your behavior and give you skills so that you don't go back to that, especially since you have an environment that might. kind of encourage it a little bit depending on you know who's doing what when. So that's kind of those would be my recommendations, improve the support at home, I mean not with you guys, but it means you know with friends and really build that support system. And then I will definitely advocate for sounds like we need to do telemedicine option for the therapist and the dietitian and that those should be weekly, at least for the next 30 to 60 days. Hopefully they'll maintain them longer than that but, at least for that time period and to have that start as soon as they're able to get an opening. It typically takes us about a week for us to pull together the assessment so they'll get this within a week. or so and so we're still plenty time before the holidays really kick in that hopefully they're operating and full schedule and there'll be able to at least review it and kind of get something going okay."
17072.0,Patient,Do you have in your nurse at the hospital actually did try to get her into the clinic you're talking about.
107.0,Provider,um I did not see that but that's probably because I did not take as much time as I should have to review everything.
17072.0,Patient,"So, no, no help her. To get more care. Good that was."
107.0,Provider,"Originally, the plan okay."
17072.0,Patient,Like it was we barely got her we had her bags packed and everything. was going to get her into that she would have lost the I think she would have not because she was a full scholarship I don't think she I think she would have lost it. which meant we would this would actually make it even worse.
107.0,Provider,yeah what a terrible choice you had to make.
17072.0,Patient,What.
107.0,Provider,"It sounds like it worked out. Yes, and thank goodness for that."
17072.0,Patient,"A lot of other her part, a lot of work."
107.0,Provider,that's huge.
17072.0,Patient,"struggle she's trying to love, but she did it."
107.0,Provider,yeah okay so yeah absolutely so which hospital was that.
17072.0,Patient,"Oh, which was ucsf."
107.0,Provider,"ucsf Okay, and when we're she potentially going to go in like an August, or something right around school."
17072.0,Patient,Very first yeah mid August 1 week.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right and it sounds like making this decision Leila sorry, making the decision to go to school was the right decision because getting her around. kids and getting back into the school environment helped create enough structure to stabilize behaviors so that she was able to kind of find the balance that she needed so yay to that. But now, at this point she still needs support on an outpatient basis, working with a therapist. Who has an expertise in eating disorders, as well as a dietitian so I can kind of piggyback off what they had recommended based on where we're at now okay perfect. and has there been any kind of significant weight loss or any other kind of things that have happened since September, it sounds like that really did everything did stabilize at that point."
17072.0,Patient,"I think there was like a couple weeks, why."
107.0,Provider,You kind of struggled for a little bit. Really yeah.
17072.0,Patient,And I think. Then we measure the hospital honestly. In the very beginning yeah yes. yeah beginning she bought it so it kind of went. A little bit.
107.0,Provider,For sure. And that's to be expected right you can't just snap your fingers and all sudden be different.
17072.0,Patient,"than became a road was good, but it was a struggle every once in a lot yeah especially before we eat, but it was."
107.0,Provider,"Good good. Well, I think I have everything I need for my assessment is there anything else you feel like I need to know of, or let's be aware of her speak to before I send you guys on your way."
17072.0,Patient,I think that's everything yeah yeah yeah not as good counselor. Or the school counselor. speaks to an outside counselor about this because we.
107.0,Provider,have so many interests oh.
17072.0,Patient,"Great you somehow want to work, they said they weren't a lot, would you see as."
107.0,Provider,"Well, I mean. yeah given given kind of what you're talking about it may be that that person has sufficient resources to be able to provide the counseling now that you've explained more about the her dynamic that may work."
17072.0,Patient,I just want to shoot a.
107.0,Provider,weekly support.
17072.0,Patient,"Oh go ahead, you don't have the support part but they want to. Ensure that she's, given the time. To take a ha okay good so they'll have only supporting."
107.0,Provider,right there be that.
