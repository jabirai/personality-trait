I haven't really been having really bad anxiety tied to the Max to where the only thing that makes them better xanax like I was literally debilitated and bad for like and I had a virus to but. My anxiety got so bad to where I literally couldn't breathe it felt like I couldn't even breathe, and now I have that kick. A nervous tic in my lip keep switching so she put me on some medicine to help with that, and if you forgot to I wanted my adderall lowered back to the bottom, to 10. I tried 30 and it literally made me sweat It made me shake I felt like I was on a grammar methamphetamine it was horrible so I want to start at ground zero. And then do that for a month and then see if that gives me what I want, if not, then go up to 15 I think we went up on the dosages way too quickly."

383.0,Provider,"Okay well. This was not long enough, I know for a session, but at least we have it recorded that she needs to have her adderall dosage decreased. And that she's having intense anxiety, if you could just write a small note to that effect. For the chart that would be appreciated this also situational stressors going on, which she told me in a phone call earlier with her son's excuse me with her daughter's son, who has been missing so.
