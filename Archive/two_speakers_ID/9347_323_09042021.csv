323.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh oh."
9347.0,Patient,"yeah she's being silly I was showing our picture her and she was laughing let me work on. yeah. But anyway, yeah just really honestly yesterday was the first day I went out to the store. my daughter took me to the hospital, you know and brought me home and then she like don't you dare go down the steps and she brought me everything and then janelle came and cook for me and stuff so. She made grilled cheese burgers okay. yeah tomato soup yeah, but it was good, the tomato soup was really good."
323.0,Provider,Talk about a comfy meal that that take you right back to.
9347.0,Patient,"Childhood I right actually if I eat something up. I just love that progress, like the tomato bazell. yeah it is so good Oh, you know. that's perfect weather too it's not too hot right now so. it's comfortable."
323.0,Provider,So what's going on in the area in terms of the whole masking and coven and all is there a spike in your area.
9347.0,Patient,"There is and that's why Honda is. that's why honda's close they don't have enough people run their their facility because everybody's back so I guess that's what they're telling us anyway. But um yeah I guess. that's pretty here in Ohio like. there's 1900 cases yesterday, or something like that. wow so and there's even saying with vaccine that that delta variants can get you sick or you can carry that germ anyway, you know with contact you touch something and then you touch something else you know. Right and you might not be able to give anybody code, because you had the vaccine, but because you can still carry the germs, so I don't know. I don't know they talked about it on the news still so. there's not many people in the stores wearing up. I noticed that croker's yesterday."
323.0,Provider,Not many masks.
9347.0,Patient,"know. very limited people I think there's about half and a half here, because you don't have such a republican. i'm not going into politics, but it is a very conservative state, therefore, some of those Conservatives are not wearing masks they don't believe that that that anybody should be able to tell them where one. So it's about I happen to have you I don't know, some people are like one aware mast and then other half depends on what store you go in, if you notice mass or two I know this."
323.0,Provider,I don't know yeah.
9347.0,Patient,But we have to where i'm at work that's for sure so.
323.0,Provider,It makes it harder to do the job.
9347.0,Patient,"it's hot, but I mean once we get to our actual work site we're allowed to take it down below or no but."
323.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
9347.0,Patient,We still have to have it on so just like wearing safety glasses if you're running internal.
323.0,Provider,Right.
9347.0,Patient,"You know, like get just taken like it's a file drill it's, not even the drill it's just like files down like there's bubbles in the paint and then you take a black marker and if it's fixable you know if. You notice something like that you if you can fix that it's a big area you just scrap it so it's it's all new to me, this is all new how how this kind of work, you know factories are run. it's really interesting. I never thought how. I guess organized, you have to be to run run a facility like that. yeah you know where they're packing things what where we're shipping containers to what color they are all this stuff so that helps us know what like where they're going if they're going to indiana if they're moving to Canada and another one somewhere else. But we get parts from marysville so and we also make parts across the street our factory so but we're the final go through before we put them in the shipping parts, you know and they're shipping rates. And some of the crates are hard to put those parts in there weird it's just different so. I don't know why they can't just have a universal CRATE and use the same colors you know I don't know but It just seems like the one is just incredibly hard as pre roll the shipping trade, it sounds so you have to walk in 10 on each row. yeah each of the fuel fuel bars common like stacks of 30 so it's interesting it's really interesting. pay me get my hair your mouth you're getting my head."
323.0,Provider,is interesting in terms of the whole organization of that.
9347.0,Patient,"But yeah it's just hard to believe, I never really put much thought into the automobile industry and where parts come from and how they're expected you know. never really thought about it and, of course, your names blown on the bar code that you're putting on every piece, so if you a lot of part of through that satisfactory it's coming right back to yeah. You gotta look. You have to look you can't. throw money. Right, you know and now they're shipping crates so they don't fall out either and hit each other, and you know of course scratch, you know run on. The truck so it's. it's neat though it's something new to learn, I never really thought much into it, but."
323.0,Provider,"Well, and i'm wondering, I mean, so I just heard a report if it wasn't last night, it was night before about how new cards are going to be harder to get."
9347.0,Patient,Right i've been hearing that it just really doesn't make sense to me housing is like double. Like double. On houses right now. But we're in we're in debt because of cloud so we're paying more for houses. backwards.
323.0,Provider,yeah I don't know. I don't need.
9347.0,Patient,"The math doesn't add up to. me and i'm confused and somebody told me we're gonna be getting them for stimulus yeah where was I at kroger's this guy came up he's not all we're staying in line because I had to get my money order for my rent and. He says, you know we're going to be get that fourth coppa check I said man, I believe it when I see it, are you kidding me."
323.0,Provider,Well i'm i'm worried only because there's going to be a big price to pay for all this.
9347.0,Patient,I know I.
323.0,Provider,"feel like we're ready, I mean I. I paid like a ridiculous amount of money for one of those little baskets have cherry tomatoes, the. grocery store. I was like $3 you must be kidding me. It was, I know."
9347.0,Patient,dabbled everything.
323.0,Provider,I feel like we're already paying the price for these. Absolute on a.
9347.0,Patient,they're sneaking in speak at it.
323.0,Provider,"So it's weird. Like I mean I get it. That the plant closed if there was a positive or more than one to be safe, but. I just."
9347.0,Patient,"yeah I just do. anyway. Oh, I don't know why did they hire whole bunch of tips to get hired in if you don't have work i'm so. But i'm gonna keep it, I mean it's my back's good i'm. Going i'd like to a benefit and get paid him i'm worth three caught back up. That at the hospital, you know. Right, everything was going on and try to save my house, so I have to file bankruptcy, so I wasted my retirement money away basically. Right like I like catching up to do with that so."
323.0,Provider,Did they say how long you would be tempting for there might be an option of permanent.
9347.0,Patient,"They say 9090 days to six months. And a lot of people don't want to, because it means that benefits to the. staffing agency, you have to go second shift, you have to do this, I don't care if i'm getting a four three be i'll go to I don't care. i'll go do another job because this job here. is really hard, if I can do this job I know I could do anything. Right, because even that guy told me he says, I can't believe that happening over here over there is. Usually, a man man run that line and i'm sure that's what made my back even you know already store as a flaw it just was a double whammy you know, plus I was lifting hurl by you know, so I don't know, but it was the horrible most agonizing pain i've ever had. And i'm not kidding at all. I mean it made me tear it put me in tears, it was so bad to straighten my legs out at that point, because the sciatic nerve, it was pinched off. so bad, so I never knew that. Oh, my. God i've had it before until I had it for real this time."
323.0,Provider,That you didn't break anything.
9347.0,Patient,"I know I know it makes me wonder, but you know I take magnesium and calcium. And vitamin D, right now, because my primary care said, my vitamin D was like. whoa HALO. yeah so.

For over. 20 years if you want. and benefits, yes, yes here yo I have been a long time so it's nice to get back in somewhere, I can actually save some money and investing and get ready. To be on medicare I was so fearing I am I going to be wanting people are going to live on like a $600 every month, like you know what I mean and and just barely paying my rent my. old lady, you know what I mean like know what I got 20 years I better hurry up and you know what I mean like ah.

323.0,Provider,"Well, and just think of all the stress that's coming off just because I mean what if this becomes a permanent placement."

Some pressure, maybe I need to start seeing a chiropractor you know i'm going to ask Jen about that, if that will help me, you know now that i'm getting the work to my body mechanics i'm not going to stream my body. right as much either you know what I mean Now I know why she told me don't step up on that ledge and stepping up and down off that she's like because you're going to kill your back.

To the warehouse I don't know."
323.0,Provider,"I don't know what my husband says, you know I mean we're older now too, but he says that he'd rather hire somebody later in their career than the new ones anymore. Because they just don't want to work."
