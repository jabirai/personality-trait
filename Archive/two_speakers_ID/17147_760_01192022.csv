760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah Okay, good for you, when do you expect to move in."
17147.0,Patient,I don't know you. You know. paperwork skirts.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right So how have you been with your mental health symptoms and dealing with assertiveness we talked about. You know your feelings from your past with your dad and and also learning to be assertive how you feel you've been coming with that."
17147.0,Patient,"What other do a week now we got off that we've done the last talk, I was really emotional. I don't know, I was really emotional close at a point where I couldn't feel like our Laguna like nothing was happening. Like, I guess, I was just frustrated. not find a place and my the time so. And then that. was my that was just like like another thing that I do, but then I just came to realize that I can't. Do that right now, so is this for me to be in that with the last of knowing that the process and i'm gonna i'm gonna get there, instead of looking like dang I got this I got this."
760.0,Provider,"yeah little little things, little by little. And a lot better when you get the housing problem resolved so that's okay alright so. What do you, what do you think that you want to work on. Now, where do you where do you think you're at. We talked about assertiveness. Can you talk to me about what that means to you to be assertive with whether or not you think you're assertive."
17147.0,Patient,definition.
760.0,Provider,Or you don't.
17147.0,Patient,know I don't know.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, a lot of times, it can be talked about that, I think you mentioned, you were in the mental health field right didn't you tell me that."
17147.0,Patient,don't comprehend forceful personality.
760.0,Provider,"Well it's not it's it's. it's to be able to assert like usually it's in response when we get frustrated or angry. But people can be. People can. But it can be it can extend beyond that, because you can be assertive in order to put up the right kind of boundaries with others that are important in your life, you know, like setting up boundaries with your dad other people that. it's important to do that with. So, like an aggressive aggressive style would be somebody who doesn't seem like you at all roseland but somebody who would be like no yelling or pushy or you know even verbally verbally attacking or even physically attacking could be aggression. Passive aggressive. is less do the opposite passive is the kind of person that they think Oh, they just kind of let everybody walk all over me I just go along with what everybody else wants because I want to avoid the problem but they end up getting kind of."
17147.0,Patient,frustrated.
760.0,Provider,"frustrated and then. And then, it tends to go to passive aggressive where it's kind of vacillating. Between the two like between somebody you are passive for a period of time and then boom, you know snap because the anger and frustration and so long. Island and you become a."
17147.0,Patient,"Partner boy yeah because i'm not listen that people walk around these just I just feel like it's not the right time, the right thing, so I let that go and then I mean that the girl have a little bottle and then. Like I get that confidence to that person versus just they say to me now please wrap it up in volume."
760.0,Provider,"So assertiveness you know, an easier way to kind of a more simplistic way to break it down would be an aggressive person kinda has the feeling like you know my needs and my feelings are important for your needs are not."
17147.0,Patient,"From the past of the passive person has an attitude, like my needs are not important."
760.0,Provider,"But yours are. And passive aggressive this kind of like depends, I suppose, and but then with assertiveness it's a way of respecting both people's needs and perspective. But still, stating what in a respectful way, what is important to you. So that's so that makes kind of sense we had talked about you had talked about wanting to learn to be assertive so, can you think of some give me some examples of how you think you might have been passive aggressive. In the in the recent past. With anybody doesn't have to be with."
17147.0,Patient,me but i'm not speaking out what I need to.
760.0,Provider,In what way.
17147.0,Patient,"Right, the fitting muscle like lemon speak like. Taking the blame as if, like I did it but they don't know the whole truth dynamics."
760.0,Provider,So something bad happens and then somebody comes at you trying to blame on you. And you just kind of like let it roll just kind of going along with.
17147.0,Patient,You because I don't like competition.
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay and Okay, and how does that usually work out for you."
17147.0,Patient,"guys. It pisses me off because. Like I look at that, as a way of like respecting I let him speak, but then after like split it out for like I don't know i'll think I have to think what i'll say before I say so. Sometimes I quit myself. And speaking when I was on say because I don't want to hurt that person's film. We that's why I do that."
760.0,Provider,"there's nothing wrong with taking a break if if there's some kind of a controversy between two people there's nothing wrong with saying you know you seem to be upset right now. i'm starting to feel but upset right now and let's just give me a minute i'm going to going to go take a walk or. i'm going to go to my room or. let's talk about this later and then kind of giving yourself some space and time, maybe you could journal about it, or even just go on a walk and just think about it and and learn ways to say what you feel you know we could we could practice that'll that if you wanted to. Because you don't have to respond in the exact moment that something is going down, you can take a break. Does that."
17147.0,Patient,"mean i'm. Making the person feel her rather than mine so so like taking in what they think I do where I think what I think that as then read me this. No, I don't say that not as well. So yeah."
760.0,Provider,"yeah so sometimes something comes out of your mouth and you mean it one way that somebody else perceives it another way, and then they remember the words wall. yeah yeah so, how would that be for you to assert what you really mean."
17147.0,Patient,"To. How can we. Think about it, like to think about it in a way that. Will absolutely fascinated and know correct. Correct what they think that's it and correct the rats."
760.0,Provider,"So how How would the words come out of your mouth in the moment of a of a cause like or any size of a conflict between you and somebody else how could, how could you."
17147.0,Patient,Know Sir it's fully muscle different old calm versus like you're saying I have an attitude.
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm. You can say you know if we'll do you mind if I give you some feedback. yeah so what I could what I would suggest, or what I could say is I could say. I encode and I understand, based on what you're telling me. I can understand why you may be feeling upset right now. When I said. What I said, is this is what I meant so maybe there's a problem of you know. Leading with words like maybe there's a problem of not understanding each other well right now, and this is what I really must. Let me just clarify this, because this is what I meant because I wonder if, maybe. you're not perceiving what I said or what I meant, and if i'm you know, and then I might even throw in if I misspoke I apologize that's not what I meant. That would be another thing you could kind of add and see it, this in that way i'm. validating the person who's feeling upset with me but i'm also validated myself. Does that seem like something that you could do or practice, you see yourself doesn't have to be my words but. Some version of similar words you could."
17147.0,Patient,yeah like reflecting on. Like less than a minute to her with it. But. yeah 30 what me.
760.0,Provider,"Yes. Because what what ends up happening, when a person like that was. I don't even know that they're aggressive but. they're going to take it if you. just stay quiet they're going to take their their perception as fast, because he didn't correct them."
17147.0,Patient,But what are like know the guy. Okay.
760.0,Provider,So I told that's that's the. The boyfriend that wants something more from you than you want from him is this we're talking about is this somebody else.
17147.0,Patient,"yeah okay we're friends, but without I don't i'm. By no other country okay terrible I know I ever been to be okay his little sister is adopted, so I read the mom asked me to be her mom so i'm between her mom but he's. A father. But even though that's his sister she's adopted so legally that can be heard on that. Okay, but this is somebody this is somebody at church I assume right yeah okay yeah. So we're. I told him I was like because you said that you don't want me to be. Like anyone's to be angry and about who cares about so I told him that i'm not angry and they request that deal so then. I told him everything like you're like okay i'm not in the mind Sam so within myself and my mindset and lynch of stuff like that. Then i'll just make sure that between low, we had a role on I don't want to interfere with the relationship of the top. Like no i'm not gonna let anything happen like that Okay, so now it's not awkward, but it has an effect, so I know myself and TIM I just said hi and buying something, and all of a sudden, you text me yesterday and said that he want to talk to me, so I don't even know you want to talk about."
760.0,Provider,That he does want to that you. Are you.
17147.0,Patient,"Okay, so i'll even know what. The language that I do something. So."
760.0,Provider,So it. kind of makes you feel nervous a little uneasy.
17147.0,Patient,"yeah because, like, I told you what i'd say and then said Okay, and he was type of person like. He because he can around me what I say he will, will you will agree to versus him having an opinion on it. But maybe feels like when we talk. or when I am super pain like okay okay like instead of just saying when you feel like i'm having a real conversation just mean just telling him what I feel versus so I can see myself in his shoes, but he's not telling what you do with them."
760.0,Provider,"yeah so so perhaps if i'm hearing you right he's a bit passive with you. yeah Okay, so what when we what we. Based on what we just. talked about what we kind of already know when somebody is being passive with me, that means they're not really telling me the truth about what they feel right."
17147.0,Patient,"And I even asked them like no nothing no well i'm like, how can I go so far. As just pointing to that."
760.0,Provider,"You can because he you can only be your authentic self you can't be an authentic self for somebody else you know what i'm saying so. You know I guess having the conversation, you know, because you guys it's kind of a heavy duty kind of responsibility being God parents, I know there's a lot of you know, spiritual guidance that you're both required to give to to the child, you know, and so it kind of requires some partnership. At least on that level with him. Today, about. So it's going to be important for you, if you're if you're going to fulfill your role is it's godmother to to kind of work with him. On some level, at least in in that area. And this is somebody you probably see on a regular basis, because he goes to your church right."
17147.0,Patient,"Well i'll facetime him like one F inside him to speak to her and you let me see her, and I see that. That, I have a golden era, because. One of the sisters was positive, so I was like, no, no."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay. All right, so So how can you practice of certain assertiveness What if what if he becomes passive aggressive, as now, you understand what that means somebody who's passed that they pull everything out and then explode. hours. You think you can hand, how do you think you can respond to this uncomfortable communication between him and knew if it goes that way let's just practice a little bit."
17147.0,Patient,"i'm going to listen to the first. One of the estimated what I said and reassure reassurance, and that didn't was not good. But I also have to call myself because."
760.0,Provider,You might know.
17147.0,Patient,Of course earlier than to say what they say so.
760.0,Provider,"yeah i'm really thinking. there's nothing wrong with taking a timeout you can tell them i'm starting to get upset I don't want to say the wrong thing I want I want us to communicate right, you and I so i'm going to take a break. And i'm going to come we'll we'll talk about this at another time you know give yourself a couple of hours at least two. To do that, do you usually communicate with him via Internet or."
17147.0,Patient,"You see him face to face in person. As well when he talks he wants me in person, but I guess."
760.0,Provider,"yeah. So that would be one way to kind of deal with that, depending on what happens. And, and you know because I think you told me that he has feelings for you, but you don't have feelings in that way for him to just care about him as a friend."
17147.0,Patient,"Like okay so with me my mind is focused on cuz now i'm gonna i'm like really you know, so my mind is focused on like bettering myself, and I feel like he will be discretion if I did, let him in, so I do like him i'm not gonna say I do like them. Okay, I know how to defer my feelings on to know what I want versus pills pills fillings and you know going."
760.0,Provider,"Well, there is such a thing roslyn, as you know, being in a relationship with somebody that you care about but also having it be the right time. In somebody's life and perhaps. That would be something that you could say you know you could say this just you know you can hear him. And you can just tell him whatever is true for you, I just it's just not time for me Eric right now i'm young. i'm I want to be a good God mom I want to work on myself and I just don't feel that everything i'm dealing with in my own life my personal life it's just not time for me and that kind of makes it a little bit easier. And and that's asserted."
17147.0,Patient,yeah but I kind of feel like. We pulling him down make you still have interests epidemic so cuz I don't know if I will show you know what happens when I like alchemy people i'm not saying that. means putting him all right now is what we're going to have in the future.
760.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, you, we can only there's you know I like to think of things in turn what is within my circle of control, what are the things that I can do, I can focus on being a good God mom I can I can do my journaling I can go to my church, I can do my prayers I can do my Bible study. I can do my exercise, you know look for for a new place to live, all these things that you're working on those are things that we have control over so reactions. from other people, even though we have the best maybe we have the best wishes for them in mind, but having how somebody else reacts is that something that you have control over roles."
17147.0,Patient,"No, I know."
760.0,Provider,"yeah So do you think that, so as far as communication, so there can be peace in being assertive. and saying what I say, saying what I need to say and then, at the same time, if that's not somebody else's struggling with them with that. Then that's not your responsibility, nor do you have any power over that. You can certainly maybe say a prayer for him, you can wish him well do all those kinds of things, but that's you know being focused on what are, what is it that I can control, what can I do, and like kind of separate that from the things that you can't."
17147.0,Patient,Because there's no answer to.
760.0,Provider,The other thing.
17147.0,Patient,yeah. Also kind of feel us me telling him that or the sinless our friendship. And that will make your hardest to have a person because of what. That riddle what of what it is. Because it because it feels confusing.
760.0,Provider,"that's valid. And perhaps there's a part of you that wants to be in a relationship where things kind of already said that. there's different part of you, but the maybe the larger part of you is more interested on improving yourself right now feeling yourself right now and growing as a person is that fair to say."
17147.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Then perhaps a little bit of space, you know you can even be a problem with that. Just Does he know that you like him like that, or he does not know that."
17147.0,Patient,"i'll call them that. I thought on that. But I just I just I just don't want the pressure, but at the end of the day, I think it's gonna be like filling so yeah this is gonna have to. be redundant or bring in a movement but also. I don't know. I can I don't know what. To say like I don't know what."
760.0,Provider,"was said and how, how would you set up boundaries protect yourself from that confusion, because that's gonna that's going to. Those kinds of feelings are going to kind of detract from your focus on the things that you, you want to focus on. And you know. So how could you set up some boundaries for yourself and."
17147.0,Patient,"Of course listening, but it was just like. me doesn't matter who they are, or am I interested in them, so it will create a yes Facebook good, but then apply. We can be portal. So it's like hindering our friendship or hindering. I want to hinder as. Communication. Okay, does it no it doesn't so I was going to hinder that."
760.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, is that the part of you that kind of wants to be in a relationship kind of holding on in that way, do you think."
17147.0,Patient,"Well, or is. Not what alyssa friendship we're not."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. I think saying all that maybe maybe telling him, you want space and telling being honest with why you want space and wishing him the best and wanting the best for him and for you and expressing that and telling him why. would be that's that's all things that are within the things that you can control. But it doesn't take on things that you cannot because when we try to take on things that are outside of our control. It causes stress there's there's really no action that we can do, because because it's outside of our circle of control, so therefore there is no action that I can take truthfully that's going to help me resolve this in my head. And so it causes anxiety causes stress mate might cause people to avoid and then other bad feelings start to build."
17147.0,Patient,"Like alpha like I don't want to apply me, let him go this thing will I don't know. If."
760.0,Provider,"You can stay in confusion, but, but if you're going to spend a lot of time together and you're you both of you are having this five going between the two of you that gets kind of confusing. So you know, maybe it's best to deal with the confusion. If you don't want to get involved in the relationship, maybe it's best to deal with the confusion on your own you know or or with another friend somebody else to help you process that."
17147.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And then, I guess, there are certain areas where you kind of have to deal with them, based on what you told me you're gonna you're going to see him in church."
17147.0,Patient,"And that's the thing. i'm kind of looking worrying about what the our people are saying that. In that it's going to have effect on us, I. don't."
760.0,Provider,"You talk about the other, the other parts of the congregation are going to talk about what's going on between you two."
17147.0,Patient,"are like X news also. Right that's your problem, I mean if."
760.0,Provider,It makes you uncomfortable.
17147.0,Patient,"yeah and it makes me makes me have initiative, so I have to him, I have to have permission to not like it looks like. We don't have whatever that will Robinson."
760.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah well, you can keep your own personal business your own personal business, you know. That, again we can't control the actions of others, so if people in the congregation are going to talk. they're going to talk, no matter what you do you think that that's fair to say, or what you don't know. So, again. When we take action roslyn I think it's helpful to kind of break it down Is this something that I think control. Or is this something that I cannot control kind of goes into one of those two buckets and if it's something that's you can't control but it's causing you some kind of pain, or some kind of a negative emotion. The only level of control, you have is to be assertive to process your feeling to process your thoughts and it's it's to bring that emotion and bring it back within the circle that you can control."
17147.0,Patient,yeah because then there's forward momentum.
760.0,Provider,"We may not like everything that's going on over there, and you don't have to like it. But the, the only way to take action is to take it out of that area that I cannot control and bring it back into a way that I can control this and if that means you know processing your feelings about others talking about it or. About somebody else's emotion or somebody else's statement. kind of important to to bring that back."
17147.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,So I guess you kind of dated him before in the church and everybody kind of.
17147.0,Patient,"I mean like we like each other, but we really want to move on our way to the end and I think what really what really started, it was because they helped me move the family, their family your family. And at that time, I think we most we emotionally connected and asked what it's kind of like confusing. Because emotional, because we have we move and all and then I have to think that I have to our himself, because he did that, but then we talked about, then you know just like okay. But because. It was around Christmas, when I moved out my mom house, nobody helped me move and it's like baseline me as their own so really, I guess, not the bird in the pencil was. I agree, some mashed potatoes with them and then I will post."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, you told me that this was this was not this Christmas, this was the previous Christmas right."
17147.0,Patient,"yeah, so I think that's really like made it form we were in we were boyfriend girlfriend will be worth it. But I just I, I think the misconception was from the mom because, even though I agree that I will take the picture I mean have pj masks opinions I don't know the effect of what it will make him and I look like. I would just okay yeah like this. It will be best to me, you know this Christmas i'm thankful that you guys helped me it was just like that type of it wasn't like oh like no i'm not being listed this you know."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17147.0,Patient,"So that really then Lucy did. click outside of the owners, we know that we wasn't that title."
760.0,Provider,Okay So how could you insert yourself with his mother and your I know his mother is also your friend. How can you assert yourself and your feelings about this or.
17147.0,Patient,"Have a conversation, let them know that like what I just drew."
760.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah and I think being honest about it can be can be good, you know just let him know i'm just not in this stage in my life, right now, because i'm dealing with a lot of stuff and since she's your friend she probably already knows that you're dealing with a lot of stuff."
17147.0,Patient,Now I.
760.0,Provider,Think that's fair to say or do you think you keep it from her.
17147.0,Patient,"US part of me for. Her but even on those because, but I agree with what I like it has more dominant than I think."
760.0,Provider,Because this is something that she wants and so maybe you feel you're disappointing your friend is that part of this poll that you don't want to discipline disappoint your friend.
17147.0,Patient,"Semester will probably not answer the portal, this is pulling her address think that. that's a lot of Christmas through my accent I don't know what. So this report could be part of it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. If you don't have an answer again. I don't know right now, let me think about it. Because I don't want to tell you wrong because I haven't really had time to process that question. And then give yourself time to process the question. Because I don't know is an answer."
17147.0,Patient,mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,Maybe it's not a satisfying answer. Okay. So what else has been happening for you rose rosalynn. that's pretty much it okay. How has how has your anxiety been.
17147.0,Patient,"Now that I have place, I can, if. i'm not stressed."

17147.0,Patient,"Job what I know a lot about will come. yeah no comments. When I think okay now it's like a triple is, I have to do with myself so i'll put personal muscle and knowing that i'm going to do it, first of all employees like i've been taking i'm applying so it's not like I worked on that one, so I think that. was like."
760.0,Provider,"Just just be consistent it's it's a daily consistency look every day apply every day, and you know the job market is pretty good right now I don't know where you live. Yes, i'm sure is pretty good most places in the country, right now, so that's good so So what are the main things you do to cope with stress what are your coping skills. Okay. How often are you doing that."
17147.0,Patient,"Well, yes I don't know Monday. Last week I went."
760.0,Provider,To the gym good. So you've been pretty consistent with that.
17147.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Well, good in any other coping skills that you're using."
17147.0,Patient,cooking on cooking one. Okay i'm not spending money out to eat for. Like a specific a lot like. Oh i'm. Like I guess what the hell does lower mind because last my goal is more. hmm.
760.0,Provider,So you're trying to be mindful of the way you're spending the way you're using your money. and save it and conserve it so that you don't cause further financial stress later. yeah hey good. Anything else happening any other ways that any other coping skills that you'd like to learn.
17147.0,Patient,"And mean. Locally about it well. yeah one of my goals is. To make more time it's like my peers. I know that of. people that are here like say, for instance, that trips i'm having better and like of the church owns the long like I go leave like. Conversely, for hours and hours. And I just started settled in Toronto so Margot my friend Susan Wendy wants me to hang out with her, since most outgoing but i'm most i'm not going to like. me making more time for them, but then is like I don't know how, when I do I don't know how to like kids I don't start a conversation about life."
760.0,Provider,Lessons you can ask questions.
17147.0,Patient,"By going further. conversation. It just that. The time is what. is making the time like I have we make time so that we celebrate your birthday and stuff like that, but it's just like. Okay, so I don't want her. Like you know we talked about last time about being perfect I just I don't want to say that because she looks up to me. So yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so maybe sometimes you feel a little bit uncomfortable when you're hanging out late after church, or if the if they're."
17147.0,Patient,"If they're like whoa I don't feel comfortable it's just that. I don't have it boot them and share with them so it's like i'm first thing that first thing well you know Okay, so my friends know with others to others and i'm like that can't so I feel like i'm forcing myself. To have a little issue with someone. You know that I have monkey unique ways of. Others as a term. That, I see that I. I see how they interact with them, so I want to interact with don't like that, but i'll find it difficult to that."

As the Group and and then it becomes easier to you know, then you can kind of use that studying the Bible at home on your own with your free time but then also coming back and using that as a way to connect at a deeper level with some of the others in the group. or volunteering for jobs where there's like a group of people working on a certain tasks, not to be the solitary person like in the kitchen or maybe in the babysitting the kids all by themselves with the kids but. In with the Group of the other adults like with with the job to do to benefit the church kind of gives you a kind of a foundation to kind of talk about and bond over and. And then, it just takes that commitment, and that daily and that regular engagement with those people to kind of build a more positive. deeper relationship and then, and then the communication, the conversation just flows it's not something that you have to worry about her or think about how you're going to feed it just naturally does so."

760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so yeah it's just it's just about building that process and developing relationships is quite you just kind of have to feed it and and and show up and be there to the best of your ability. Perhaps it's you know if we go back to the earlier part of this conversation starting to think about how can I be more assertive. In my relationships and you know, because sometimes I think we can find ourselves falling into negative ways of coping. Like incapacity or passive aggressive and may not even be the fault of the other person sometimes it's just what we're used to it's just our habit and it's what feels normal to us, and so we just do it without really thinking too much about it so working on a way to be assertive. For me kind of seems like a very Christian thing to do, it's validation you know validating. You validating me and that's you know kind of you think about the message that Christ gave us, you know. Give everything you know. be giving to your brother, you know take care of your brother that kind of thing and so you're you're validating. But it doesn't need to be like a two way street."
