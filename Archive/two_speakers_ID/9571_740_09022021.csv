I may add some repetitive questions, just to kind of get to know, I was reading a little bit of your history. And just try to get a basis on. Any challenge that any difficulties, you may have, so I know I can read this but I rather for you to tell me, so we could just start off there, what are some. difficulties and challenges and things like that that you. Be feel facing you want to continue to work on why in treatment."
9571.0,Patient,"i'm. Over, for we are working, a lot on like my anxiety kind of like getting over the past trauma like kind of trying to get myself out of that and I get myself out more. I started taking well putrid almost two months ago. And so far, I felt like it's helped a lot with anxiety. and getting me out, but I do still feel like kind of tired, but that's why I spoke to Sean talent we're going to up the dose to see like if that helps. But I think, for the most part, like a lot of things that we had worked on in the plans that we have made like they've been making progress so far."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
9571.0,Patient,"Like I don't really feel like i'm stuck or like i'm like in the depressed state where I don't want to do anything and then, when I go out I don't really get as anxious anymore. yeah like I had an interview earlier this week, I was a little bit nervous, but I was able to like control it, and then just the other week I had started a different job and I wasn't nervous about going in and meeting, like any of the clients or."
740.0,Provider,"anything like that, so that was. My so sounds like you are making a lot of progress, it sounds like that you are. Being able to kind of overcome some of the social anxiety that you're bitter experiencing. Let me ask you this, before I read on the history, the history, said that you, you didn't have any trauma as a child, but you did experience like physical abuse with your boyfriend is that the trauma that you're talking about."
9571.0,Patient,"yeah we'll also like not really. abused like not fiscal cliff family, but I was in like I guess a really toxic environment with my family. My dad was really controlling and he would just like be like verbally abusive towards my mom and stuff and like just seeing all that and growing up, with all that kind of like screwed me up a little bit."
740.0,Provider,"yeah I understand. So your dad was battling with your mouth. And when you say its food its food, you have to explain it to them a little bit."
9571.0,Patient,"So I feel like my dad's like really like manipulative and he'll tell like hell Tommy things to make me kind of like feel bad to get his way of how he wants things done. And like I guess kind of growing up with that when other people would do it to me I wouldn't really think it was anything bad I kind of just thought like Oh well. My dad used to do this, and he loved me and he was my dad so like this is like how things are supposed to be so I wouldn't really like speak up for myself if I didn't want to do something, because I was too scared that like I was either going to get left or. Like me saying no or speaking for myself was wrong."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so communication is communication feel like a challenge for you."
9571.0,Patient,"um I feel like i've been able to speak up more for myself, because I don't know if you've seen in the notes, I was talking to me about like a friends with benefits situation. with him like i've been able to speak up more and like i've told her how like it makes me feel a lot better to like feel like I have a voice, but i've also done it with like family and friends, too, so it feels better. Like I don't feel that guilty feeling or like on speaking for myself and they're not going to like me or. This is going to happen. Which is good it's a nice feeling."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely and it's always amazing to be with identify that you do have a voice and that shows with it does need to be heard, like your voice is important. Like is that, basically, even if its massive may begin to other you know, is still a significant is still significant to you, and what you feel in what you say is valid. So this this good man, you said something about friends with benefits what happened What was it about."
9571.0,Patient,"it's been like over a year that we've been doing this, but. He basically will commit to me, but he, like so he was upset because I was like going to experiment with females. And he got like really jealous over it, and I told them like. Because he has a girlfriend but she's out of State, so they don't really see each other, I guess, they just talk, but like she's somebody from his past. And I will tell him like I don't know why are getting mad and like. jealous over that when you basically have your emotional connection with somebody and then you just have me on the site and basically and like if I want to go out and find my emotional connection like, how is it fair that you want to stop me. But. we're still hanging out we're still doing what we've been doing. I still kind of kinda have feelings for him why don't want to say kind of like I know I still have feelings for him. it's just like I guess maybe also like being comfortable like having him around that long. That has been going on there hasn't really been anything like that came up. Recently, were like I felt sad or like felt anything like that, because there will be a couple times, where something will happen, and then I would feel jealous or i'd feel like hurt. And then I would speak with amy about it, but for the most part, things have been pretty smooth and just go in the golden."
740.0,Provider,"You you Okay, with the situation is found that this this this this interesting so. He can. take out a girlfriend but his girlfriend average day he you know I mean if you don't want to commit because he committed to somebody if you decide that you want to pay will be in the five P thing and."
9571.0,Patient,"I don't know i'm still trying to figure that out because, like so before he even got what that girl, I know that she's somebody from his past the leg we had been doing this for a while it was just recent maybe like two three months ago that he had got with her. And then he told me body that go I don't want to hurt you, but then like he still. And I felt like he's pretty manipulated to in a way, he, like he comes to my house we hang out like will eat dinner, like all that stuff like. will go out places he'll pay or like i'll pay will do things together, as if we were like together but we're not technically officially together if that makes sense."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, you make. me famous. We don't we don't say right here. You don't we all say I like we don't say right here on this topic, because. I want you to be able to identify the pattern. There is a pattern here and the thing about it a lot of times when we experienced trauma history. Right, you said the day was pretty manipulative. Right. yeah man you saying that the dude is true, which. is pretty minute. So manager I don't know nothing i'm still along i'm not i'm not on get anything but let's let's just let's just hypothesize could it be. That you're. Still attracted to this young man who basically have another girlfriend who's choosing to submit to her instead it's to commit to you. Could it be there. That you're attracted to the attracted to the manipulation. there's something that you've experienced in the past with it."
9571.0,Patient,"I have thought about that. A couple times like why don't I just you know, like cut him off and go find something else I guess like another thing that I do kind of struggle with is like being able to get out there and meet new people. Whether it's just friends or potential relationships or stuff like that, like I don't really I find it hard to put myself out there. And to do that, so I don't know if maybe that's also part of the reason why still stays because i'm comfortable with him and I don't feel like going out to find somebody new to restart and do everything with. But I think the manipulation, a little bit it's probably like a pattern from before like i'm just so used to it that, like. More I let him do that."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9571.0,Patient,"Even though, like yes, I do voice myself and tell him these things. I think the fact that it still allow him to do it, he thinks it's okay."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, there you go."
9571.0,Patient,"So he just I know like. I know what it is, but I."
740.0,Provider,"Think about it, is the fact that it doesn't matter if you boil it. yeah what baby isn't there okay well i'm setting a boundary. But the you know we have a stick to your boundary because i'm not really gonna stick to my boundaries."
9571.0,Patient,yeah because I allowed him to come.
740.0,Provider,"So right. So we constantly compromise and boundaries here. yeah and so it's kind of like our new Thank you see me Yes, he is he, like sushi oh wow, so why should actually she was leaving anyway. yeah i'm saying and so. And the thing about it is understanding getting out and meet new people is a struggle, it is true. Trust me, it is a struggle, but it's also a beauty. it's a beautiful thing. And all the reason why is because you get to start over from scratch right, the thing about it is when you meet new people, no one knows your past. No one can condemn us from your decisions. That you made in the past. No one can try to hold you hostage based off of poor decisions that she made in the past, and then you get to discover new things and new, positive people. That can and the beautiful dynamic is is that even with people you know when you have the right type of people in your life they shopping you to make you better. Right and even when I mean, of course, you know after you've muscle example. If. If I if I was you know if i'm in your situation and i'm like. Why me and I want to invest and nobody oh there's too much time is too much work is too much energy is pretty much my emotions that I got to try to fit appropriately and put on some audio on guam it on contain. right but. At the same time, my question to you is. What is it what does that do to your self esteem and your self worth and your value."
9571.0,Patient,It. doesn't make me grow any bigger than what it was I can just keep seeing the same position. And then over time it eventually like. or drop my self esteem and whatnot because. Being with him and him not committing. will make me feel like what's wrong with me.
740.0,Provider,"boom baby. Right and they'll make you feel like you're like well if you commit the high and he won't commit to me then what's the thing better than anyone, she. doesn't feel nothing is wrong do at all, the only thing about it is, is that you've experienced trauma, we all have we all have experienced trauma right, myself included in my hand. Right in some way, the thing about it is that, even with the trauma that we've experienced it can either do two things. You can either lead us down the same path to where we we find ourselves in gay. engaging with those people who remind us of those from basically those who basically a traumatized us, or it can cause us map it can cause us to learn. This is what I don't want. I don't want it, because I have to say, my father I want a manipulative man I don't want someone to see for our wants to wants to play my emotion. I don't want somebody on treats me I don't want somebody who's on the top poison in my ears I want it, because this what I had. You know, as a child and I don't want to continue to in my adulthood, but it will say it could be two days and pain and so right now, you chose him the first way. yeah well i'm accustomed to look at my data data So there we are already know what can happen. But then you have the actual sale. Is this what I."
9571.0,Patient,know. I know it's not I.
740.0,Provider,well.
9571.0,Patient,"Like I was telling me to before I think part of me is kind of just like comfortable with the situation until like I find somebody that like i'm willing to pursue and like do something with. um because I know eventually like, and I even told him multiple times like i'm not going to be here forever doing this thing with you like. And that's what I noticed he'll try to like two more go out of his lead to like gets the for do things and i'm just like okay like you're only doing that because i'm telling you like. you're not going to keep me here forever, you know, and I don't know if he notices that like I see those things, but I just don't mention it to him, but. yeah like there's some things that I won't speak on just because, like, I felt like it's not really worth my time to say it, because, like, I know, deep down, he knows i'm."
740.0,Provider,"pow pow. pow, we can say I won't say because you know what you are reading."
9571.0,Patient,"These things before, so I don't need to repeat it."
740.0,Provider,"Yesterday i'm gonna tell you I mean a different. They don't need it the first time. You don't you don't clean. Speaking to speaking about someone who may receive one place. It okay. But the thing about it is seven days that a lot of times if if if you say we're deep down, he knows, but really and truly Does he really now because, again, you said boundaries, but you don't keep your own so therefore whatever you tell him, you don't take you seriously. yeah So the question comes back to the sea really now. Because it can go in one ear out the other good like I. See those talking like young he called leaving anyway. yeah you know i'm saying so, it just want to post things to wear it and then let's go let's go let's press rewind real famous you made a statement and you say well. Where Am I wrong i'm just going to. fill out about here. So i'm keeping the rain, you know just to keep me company until I found somebody. So now, the one that's being manipulated is starting to manipulate do you see this."
9571.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And the thing about it is if that's The thing that you don't want your spark to do. yeah you know i'm saying you know and the thing, and my thing is how you can get out there and find somebody else if you just say this is a struggle for you. They may get if they are good, but you gotta remember your average, the problem is is like Okay, you know I mean people have to merge."
9571.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"And that's a lie, I don't even really see myself doing it that's a struggle for me i'll meet somebody you say, this is a struggle for you."
9571.0,Patient,"I don't know. Get out there. I want to meet people, but I just don't know how to like. Because all this dating stuff to like online dating like I don't really like that."
740.0,Provider,"But you, like me, i'm gonna hold until I get some idea, why do you want to if you don't."
9571.0,Patient,"Know that's Another thing I haven't really take the initiative and put myself out there in a way, though I do want myself back and they think it's because I know I have him there, even though he's not fully fully there he's there enough to satisfy like the things. That I want, but I know that he won't fully commit to."
740.0,Provider,Where you're you're saying it had of this out to you.
9571.0,Patient,stupid as hell.
740.0,Provider,"i'm not saying I would never say. that's where she back. Here family to you well you know you're not really going to give me all of you, but I mean you give me enough to stick around, even though I want all of you, but at the same time. you've already given that to somebody else, but at least you give me enough, you know i'm saying so, where I don't have to go out and look for somebody else, even though I really do. want to look for somebody else, because I do want to come meet me, which is something that you're not willing to give but you still give me an email. yeah that does sound like a. Like a purple. Oh so let's talk about this all right solution vision so let's talk about how do we get out and meet up."
9571.0,Patient,I don't even know where to find them that's the thing like where would I go to potentially find somebody that I want to be friends with or potentially the instead of.
740.0,Provider,What were what are some places that you like to go.
9571.0,Patient,"I don't really go anywhere. Like recently Oh, we barely went to theme parks and then we went to like the Reagan library. But there wasn't really. Much people like. I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"So let's take the motor. Let me dating or find somebody to date at the at the equation. Take that requires. Less take the modal find somebody to be framed as the equation. Right, because what they're the the when you go out, they would they kind of mission definitely end up going around hand somebody you know i'm saying you know so let's take those off off the table. Unless you think. Of what about. Do you go to any kind of meetings or any kind of support groups her small group library."
9571.0,Patient,I don't do any. group therapy. unkindness about it.

One a moment window little lemon cakes and find you a good book and may have seating areas where you can just kind of fit because the thing about it is you want to start this last day let's take the moto. let's take the mission off the table of let me find a match. Because if they go badly, you want to find yourself first. Before you find a bad idea. Right and the thing about it is once you basically. Put yourself in a situation with this guy a lot of times you can lose who you are. Because you find yourself basically kind of conforming so that he can stick around."
9571.0,Patient,"yeah i've seen that happen, a couple times."
740.0,Provider,"yeah, and so this all by the most important thing is to find you first. So let's what are some things you like to do let's start there first."

740.0,Provider,"Oh, my especially cuz i'm alone, you know and like i'll be out there and. Well, instead of hiking What about just going around the trail, so they have trails that they're like I know hiking is more in the woods. What about I know trails and more open."

740.0,Provider,We could talk there. Okay filing trail. I might need damn i'm going.
9571.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"Alright, so reading that maybe we can check out Barnes and Nobles and and the library right."

9571.0,Patient,"mm hmm. never took a zoom the class I used to take dance classes, I took a couple of them. Like couple of months ago. mm hmm but I never went back to them. But Why was this. I think like what the when things started opening again and more people started joining the class I kind of like psych myself out a little bit and didn't want to go cuz, the more people there are in a small area like I kind of freak out all the time. So that kind of made me not want to go and be around everybody and then like have to leave because I felt uncomfortable."
740.0,Provider,When you said that during the time that. We associate that you can best.
9571.0,Patient,yeah but I noticed still like in small areas like I feel myself to still panic.
740.0,Provider,Or do you.
9571.0,Patient,It doesn't help with the mask because I feel like I can't breathe.
740.0,Provider,"yeah so maybe you could find a new location that has like a bigger area, do you have like jams and stuff I fear that offers classes."
9571.0,Patient,"um it's more like people who. Like instructors, who will like called the dance class and like do it either, and like. Like a workout studio some places are bigger some places are like more smaller. But I think amy had mentioned this one website where I can like check for a whole bunch of different things I think it's like meetup.com where you can check for like anything basically like dancing classes, or like people who read people who do like certain things so. Maybe I could check out there to see if they have like lines do I think she mentioned before."
740.0,Provider,"meetup.com. All right, are there are so many things to do on meetup. will show career find your then get moving share language, we were friends right together hone your craft. Some competition expansive will check out meetup.com four days places. meetup.com. All right. Now we're saying and I you say you like to say. Are you are you a public thing or your privacy or are you a shower singer or your open thank."

9571.0,Patient,Good yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So with Problem Solving this is something I thought about and I don't know if you're in California right. Yes, I don't know if that happens in California, but have you ever thought about doing an escape room."
9571.0,Patient,"I have. But i've never done that, before just because I don't know i've seen a movie before and i'm like Oh, what if they tried to kill off, but yeah I think. I know, but, honestly, I have. thought about doing an escape room because we're actually visited the Philippines my cousins they all went to one but at that time I already knew my anxiety was like really crazy, so I didn't want to put myself, where I was stuck in a room trying to you know solve things to get out. But I do want to do that, that is one thing that I have on one of my list of things to do."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you have family in southern California. Okay, good so maybe we can make it a family affair, because family are these are the people that you're comfortable with. So maybe you can reach out to some of your family members, because you know people to in your age group to say hey I want to do in the room."
9571.0,Patient,yeah I think that would be fun.
740.0,Provider,"I think there were two because, firstly, centers around family for this type of issue which you are comfortable with so that means it will keep her anxiety relatively low or not at all, because you know the people you love these people, and you know they care about you and they love you. Yes, Sir, all right i'm planning on live stay at home. All right, we're supposed to. Do you own any pointers."
9571.0,Patient,"I do, I own about for. A open the box to one, but I never attempted to try to put it together."
740.0,Provider,i'm.
9571.0,Patient,"Just like with reading, so I had bought like six books and it took me a couple months till I finally picked one up and just read it cuz I noticed that, with a lot of my time i'll either just be like on social media or i'll just be watching netflix. So one thing that i've been trying to do is tell myself to like take time for myself out of the day, whether it's. Like reading or doing something. Just for me. not really like watching TV or they're going to social media because I don't really see the benefits and it's just. The past time."
740.0,Provider,"Under the same thing. I think is very, very significant because, again, it helps you find out who you off. yeah right, and this is the mission now is to find you first. They should mission."
9571.0,Patient,"Okay yeah like over time. i've lost myself because, like when I go into relationships, I do focus a lot on the other person and like. Trying to people, please and make sure I don't lose them, but then like while i'm doing all that i'm basically losing myself along the way. Each time to get deeper and deeper."
740.0,Provider,"Right, and so the main the main way for you to stay healthy is to is to have you as a priority right. Yes, because the thing about it is, and this is one thing i've learned. Is that the value targeted people some filters. He gets what he wants. And if you want his take a look at the table. And I mean, why not you producer first."
9571.0,Patient,No.
740.0,Provider,"I mean, why not, you know if someone can put themselves first and neglect how or neglect your feelings or ignore your feelings and how you feel about it. Then you know you can you should basically love yourself enough to push yourself, first let me ask you do you have any issues with everything."
9571.0,Patient,"yeah I think so. i've been overweight, a lot of my life. So I felt like that plays a part in it to where I kind of like beat myself up for my body image times. um. And also like I don't really have I feel like my confidence has gotten a little bit better, but like what the anxiety like it would kind of make me like if people would make eye contact with me or like. I would get really weird I would kind of freak out in a way, like I hate it when people would look at me. But now I feel like i'm able to like. Make eye contact back and, if anything, you know, like smile or say hi just so that way, like, I can kind of get over the awkward stage. But."
740.0,Provider,"i'm looking at. it's called a savory. And it's called best possible sale. So. If you can imagine. yourself. and your. greatest form. What would your best possible self look like you don't have to answer right there you can use it as a homework assignment and we do talk about it next time. Okay, but what. Would your best possible look like and that's an every form of fashion, if weight is a concern then what's your What was your best possible self way what is, what do you weigh as the best possible self. Where do you go. Where we're what what kind of career, do you want to have do you want to be in school, do you want to get an education to what do you want to be with I mean who does your best possible to have me as your best possible self who you're talking to how many friends, do you have. What kind of friends are they you know what kind of hobbies do you have it should be as possible, so. what's your dress size is your best possible said, you know what are these things I want to know. What What if you can imagine anything What was your best possible stuff look like I think that's very, very important. Because the more you have. The more you. What I would say, the more individualistic goals that you have for yourself to become the best version of yourself. The more your confidence to be built, the more you're worth to be built, the more you set the stage will be bill, and the more you realize that you're worth more than what you're receiving right now. And that's that's, the main thing I think the healthier, you are, the more. The. More your picker improved. And that will be healthy, you are you'll attract help your people or your. Your people your life. right because unhealthy attractive unhealthy yes right say my herpes herpes. Right info these other things there so significant other so important and so when you're healthy you'll attract healthy. When your help when you are healthy you, you want help the people around you because there's something that's the that's the type of opinion reports, you want to keep up for yourself. Right, and so the best way to do that is to be able to identify like yo like one of my best possible self look like and then, once you have that out, then you can start the planet like, how can I reach this person like, how can I, how can I. How can I have, or what kind of steps do I need to take in order to be able to exist as this person am saying versus you know, like you say it more the more i'm with this unhealthy person who's choosing somebody else the hope of me, the more it makes me feel light yellow light was me. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with you."
9571.0,Patient,myself but.
740.0,Provider,yeah.
9571.0,Patient,"When they actually dig deeper and I tell myself like it's not you it's him. Tough one um yeah it takes a while to kind of get that back out of me because, like there are times here and there, where I do slip in and feel like oh. Well, could I have done better, what can I do to be better or but then also tell myself like i'm not really going to fight for him and if he. could do that I guess what kind of made me a little more attracted to him was the fact that he could have a girlfriend and say he loves her but he's over here being with me and doing other things. Like it just made me thought like what if I was her."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
9571.0,Patient,"And he was doing that to me like I don't really want that, I mean, I still let him be here and all that but just seeing all that, like yeah I feel like, even though we are friends with benefits, I feel like we're also. betters friends, so I think that's also why I don't really want to drop him yeah because I do still want to have our friendship with him, even if we don't have like sexual relations and stuff."
740.0,Provider,and
9571.0,Patient,As long as it works out but it's not then eventually just trump that too.
740.0,Provider,"Well, what happens if what happens if you put your foot down once and for all and be like yo I like being friends with you, but my lead flow."
9571.0,Patient,"I told him that one. And he is all like, I would still hang out with you. I don't know I feel like there's a possibility until he. Unless like because he said, supposedly, because there was one thing he did mention a couple weeks ago. He had told me like oh you don't love me anymore, and I was like well you never loved me and his response was if I never loved you, I want to you know be spending time with you and doing the things that we do, and I was just like like. cuz that's what I kind of thought to have like he has to care somewhat I don't think he could have no emotions and just like do everything that he does. More than less that's really just how men are built, you know."
740.0,Provider,"No, you can't you can't fare a pipe all me and based off of what you got. Okay dude it."
9571.0,Patient,"I don't know like cuz I was trying to figure that out to and i'll say did he really have no emotional connection with me into everything he's doing and see that he does have one. Second, might be possible, but like me as myself, I know that i've tried to do that with people and it just never worked out like I can't sit there, and like live a life, basically, especially for how long it's been like I never even that long it lasts like a couple of days and all know. working."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely and it's just it's definitely one of those things that you really have to fire, my apologies, I gotta deal. But it's basically one of those things that you want to really be like. You know I understand if I was going to actually be, this is my last question that I had that's what I had my last question was what what does he do for you, that makes you keep them aware. What does he do for you."
9571.0,Patient,"Like specifically for me or just the things that he does cuz I don't think he really does much for me, I think it's more of him being around and keeping me company plus also like sexual needs at the time but that's about it, he really don't do much extra."
740.0,Provider,What would that would you message to claim that you need.
9571.0,Patient,"mean that's a satisfies me in the moment, but I know like how you mentioned like I do want commitment I do want like. Somebody to potentially like have a family with later. And do things. But yeah."
740.0,Provider,"me Sir me, but I could cook for myself. Yes, you can so basically you know i'm saying that's the thing and like you said, I mean sex is a momentary thing honey once you get up, then what."
9571.0,Patient,"Is it it's like i've seen these things, where it says like. Everybody helps you in life, but like once you fought nobody helps the or something like that, like I don't know. i've seen like little means and things like that, like that's funny because, unlike you guys helping each other, get undressed and then after you like basically how sex after that you guys are just trusting yourself and all that. Like once he fought in life, like nobody cares."
740.0,Provider,"And, and the thing about it is it's one of those things where like I said, even if no one cares you have to teach people how to treat you. And you can teach somebody how to treat you if you don't know how to treat you. Does that make sense."
9571.0,Patient,"It does, because they know how I wanted to myself, but then I allow it to happen. Even though, like you said it's literally like just in the moment. Which is."
740.0,Provider,"Great a moment paid okay baby a. Baby bear right so that means I have to be something else that's keeping me here. You know anything about these. At the end of the day, like you said Oh, he just good company, I mean. You know we've worrying, but at the same time, you know by got it he can spread it, you know and it's kind of like well. I get the best of both worlds, but not really you don't get the best of both worlds, because the thing about it is, is that you know you're sharing you know you're you're basically sharing. In his world because of the fact that he gets the best of both worlds. yeah cuz he gave her and yeah. So it is you know. Like I said I want I want you to design the best for yourself, and as I understand it is very convenient. You know, but at the same time, you know, in order for us to develop in a healthier way sometimes you have to read yourself about unhealthy unhealthy thing. And people. If personally, you know that they don't add to you, but they take away from you. I mean it doesn't have the anxiety it doesn't have to depression it doesn't it doesn't have the trauma. You know it doesn't help you know i'm saying is one of those things, and sometimes that also can hold you for meeting new people because they go out there and you'd be skeptical thinking that you go meet somebody else it's just like me."
9571.0,Patient,Yes.
740.0,Provider,So you might meet somebody just like him.
9571.0,Patient,yeah. going up that you do seem to.
740.0,Provider,"fit to the thing about it is again and that's why you have to make sure that you are the best version of yourself the healthy version that you need because that's what you'll attract being your babies identify I want you. I want that, because i'm already here I don't want this because i've already had this or I deserve better than this. yeah i'm saying and the thing about it is, is that you, you saw your mom both do those situation you saw your mom both do that and then say with his. name it, you know i'm saying so it's it's definitely one of those things to where is this the one of those things to where you really want to make sure you know that hey I don't want to end up because I know I know for a fact as a child, you was like I don't want it. sorted out. I don't want it, you know i'm saying so, the thing about it is is they know you're not getting hit physically, but at the same time you have somebody to plan on your emotion and be playing with you're playing with you emotionally."
9571.0,Patient,yeah that's. I feel like that's just as training and just as bad. yeah because it takes a toll.
740.0,Provider,"so well, I think this has been a good session have appreciate you."
