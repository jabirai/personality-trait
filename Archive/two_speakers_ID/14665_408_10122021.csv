408.0,Provider,"Hello. Right. Well, we are starting you on a treatment protocol for mood stabilization, that means to reduce depressive symptoms and also to create a. I know your laugh when I say this, but a low stress lifestyle. you're surrounded by children right yeah. But that is the aim right. If you, you know with the bipolar disorder, if you is to maintain that low stress lifestyle and some of that. Is controlling your environment as much as you can having a routine having a schedule trying to keep things routine regular right and some of it is. Not rapidly changing the things that you do, including any substances you consume like caffeine and nicotine which we talked about last time."
14665.0,Patient,I have kept soda out. At a retreat myself to one cup of coffee a day still.
408.0,Provider,Good and that's fine.
14665.0,Patient,But in the cigarettes I haven't kept them out yet i'm still waiting on an appointment with Dr seldon see if I can get something to help with that.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, good that's good just talk about smoking cessation because that's certainly a process um The next step for the, of course, with the caffeine is just to see if you can. maintain your routine so that you're smoking fewer cigarettes."
14665.0,Patient,"I have noticed that in smoking fewer cigarettes already. Okay, and that's. Because i've kind of made myself."
408.0,Provider,And sometimes it's just doing things that you know you can't smoke at the same time that you do them. You know.
14665.0,Patient,"yeah and I were not I don't smoke in my house, so I have to go outside so i've cut that you know I don't like going outside of here I just don't like going outside. So I have kept them to at least half a pack a day."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, great that's great and then the next step for the caffeine I don't know how you make your coffee, but another trick is to get some decaf and mix it half and half decaffeinated coffee half the regular coffee that you like. Okay, so you still get the flavor. But you don't get as much of the stimulant. And then, of course, that alcohol consumption, where does that stand."
14665.0,Patient,um I every now and then drink and it's not like I drink belligerently I just every now and then have like two or three maybe. The wine coolers. I can't get drunk because I I go stupid i'm not gonna lie get belligerent and stupid.
408.0,Provider,"So the reason i'm asking, of course, as well as just because of your substance use history is because alcohol is a depressant. So, in the same way that caffeine and nicotine or stimulants right alcohol is a chemical depressant and so, if you when you have mood a mood disorder any chemical substance, even if it's things that we regularly think of as food and beverage could destabilize you could destabilize you."
14665.0,Patient,"yeah. Maybe. Once every three months it's very rare because, like I said when I was younger I used to drink all the time and I found out that I just I get belligerent I get stupid and i'll just cut that out a while back."
408.0,Provider,"Alright, so just keep in mind, because you've had such a struggle with the depressive symptoms keep in mind if it is going to be that every three months you're going to have something to drink, maybe stop at one. Okay, or just SIP it. very slowly. Right and then go to something else that reminds you of that like I don't know a soda or something. Okay ginger ale I don't know where the club soda mixed with fruit juice, you know what I mean something. That gives you the same experience or flavor but not the alcohol."
14665.0,Patient,Alright sounds good.
408.0,Provider,"Is that is that would that be too difficult to do, do you think."
14665.0,Patient,"yeah that'd be fun. I don't really know that i'm older, I really don't like to drink in any way like say I don't get drunk anymore I drink, maybe two or three. You know somewhere along there I get to where. i'm just calm and i'll leave it alone after that."
408.0,Provider,"Sure, but it's it it's important to know again because you are someone who has a mood disorder that getting drunk is not the issue. yeah he right and. it's the stabilizing your brain chemistry. Okay, it or the other way, to say that is trying to keep your brain chemistry as stable as possible. And so that's not an issue of getting drunk. it's an issue of alcohol in your system will have a depressing depressants effect. Okay, and it's not just at the point where you notice that you're drunk. Okay it's like. Any alcohol."
14665.0,Patient,"Okay, I can do that."
408.0,Provider,"It seems easy so just keep it in mind right, because I know you people aren't used to thinking that way they're used to thinking of certain blood levels of alcohol. As impairing their functioning whether it's you know driving walking getting along with people not getting sick but that's really at the far range right what we're talking about is much closer much tighter control to keep your brain chemistry on an even keel."
14665.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,So you're not going down in mood and you're not going up in mood too far.
14665.0,Patient,Right okay.
408.0,Provider,"All right, but that's really good progress with smoking and the caffeine. Then, what about your pain management, where hell is that been going since our last session."
14665.0,Patient,"Well, heavy honest i've had and i've been unmedicated off of everything for the past two days. So to my pharmacies giving me troubles and there's the red flagged me said that they needed to prove from you all, which are called and got somebody to call them their phone lines are being Dale now so it's things like i'm just catching issue after issue for the past couple days. i'm hoping to get everything done today and i'm hoping to get it settled out today. But my pain my pain it's been manageable steel, so the two days like I said i'll just get a little crazier and and panicky. But the pain has been. it's been manageable."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, how have you been managing it."
14665.0,Patient,"Actually walking. When I start to get at and hurt, I get the kids ready and we go walk. And, and that was also thing to do, for positive mood and."
408.0,Provider,So I guess right.
14665.0,Patient,yeah it helps it really does.
408.0,Provider,It kill two birds with one stone.
14665.0,Patient,"At well three birds with one stone wears them out, so we get."
408.0,Provider,There yeah.
14665.0,Patient,"So, but and i've also bought a yoga mat i'm going to start trying to and yoga."
408.0,Provider,Oh that's excellent I.
14665.0,Patient,mean my daughter went and got us one and made her going to try and i've heard that helps with pain management. as well.
408.0,Provider,It can yes.
14665.0,Patient,I got the yoga mat and i'm going to try it I just haven't tried it yet.
408.0,Provider,"Good so i'm in mindfulness based stress reduction, which is a treatment protocol for anxiety and depression. There are some yoga postures that are actually used as part of the treatment. And I can describe some of those to you now. If you want, and you can have those be maybe the first. The first few yoga postures that you try out. And, of course, everything has to be done very slowly and very carefully, which is the good part of that kind of exercise is your it's not about pushing yourself. Right so um and it is about the correct form right the correct position so that you're stretching but there's no pain. So um the the first few in the mindfulness based stress reduction protocol, which are yoga type postures are you would consider perhaps typical stretching. So you stand on your mat. And you raise your hands and arms up above your head and if you have do you have pain in your shoulder joints. Yes, okay so very carefully and only as far as you can raise them with fair amount of comfort so you're not actually in pain now, you might hear a little bit of clicking. Just cuz you're moving. But you're not actually ouch right."
14665.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,"you're just making an effort to stretch, and then you clasp your hands together and then turn them around and raise them toward the ceiling as to deepen the stretch."
14665.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,I don't know if you can see me see what i'm. And if that's when you reach the point where you're stretched but not in pain right then you're going to bend. And this is called willow tree and yoga speak. you're just bending like a willow tree and the wind right.
14665.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
408.0,Provider,"very slowly. very gently again there's no need to push yourself to them to an extreme degree, just very gently like a willow tree swaying in the wind."
14665.0,Patient,All right.
408.0,Provider,"And then, after after a few days of doing that you may find that you can actually look up when you do that, you can lift your chin up. Can you see me."
14665.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"You can lift your chin up to the ceiling, and what that does is, you have a little arch in your back. Just a little one you're bending your top half your body back just a tiny bit that's a good lower backstretch."
14665.0,Patient,That but.
408.0,Provider,"First, you work up to that after."
14665.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,"How does now, so far, how does that sound does any of that a little scary for pain."
14665.0,Patient,"guess okay within itself has kind of scared me and i've never tried it to bet no it's not scared I mean it is, it is it, I think I could do it. I think it'd be better than trying to exercise myself and push myself in a person worse."
408.0,Provider,"that's what normal, yes, yes, because and and really to think about not the advanced yoga postures. Excuse me, but the the gentle stretching far. Right right. i'm gonna see if I can. call up a visual of these first stretching postures and do a screen share with you. Because a picture's worth 1000 words right."
14665.0,Patient,"I went to the library, to try and get the books, you were talking about, but they of course was closed the day I got."
408.0,Provider,"Oh i'm sorry yeah well, you can still keep those in mind."
14665.0,Patient,i'm going to.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, here we go now i've got these up on the screen Now let me see if zoom will let me do a screen share with you. All right now, can you see that. You can see those postures. Yes, good so here's you can see, on your left then posture one and two that's what we what I was just demonstrating for you. Okay, all right. And then, three and four and five. Right, I was demonstrating five to you also. right but three and you have those arms up to the side. For you see you're stretching up one hour at a time and lifting your chin toward the ceiling, so you get an extra out of that as well."
14665.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,"All right now that i'm going to So these are all standing postures. Now, when you're sitting down on the yoga mat and here you can see you're doing shoulder rolls. You can also do these the shoulder rolls while you're sitting down on the map. Right. yeah either with your legs crossed or your legs straight out in front of you."
14665.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,same thing with the neck roles see his neck roles.
14665.0,Patient,mm hmm. I do those often.
408.0,Provider,"And you can of course do those said said seated as well. All right now i'm closing that out. And let me see if I can. find the seated postures. So you can see the visual. Okay, here we go, this is what I was looking for for the seated postures. All right now i'm gonna share the screen with you again. alrighty you able to see the mindful yoga poses. yeah okay so use where you're reclining on your mat this ball right. Right and and, as you can see one and two, is really the same thing I just demonstrated, for you that from a standing position. Or you could do it sitting in a chair this is, you can do it when you're lying down right. So then you're stretching your arms toward the opposite wall. And you can do the same thing, which is the willow tree with the hands LACE together, you can do that line down to. And sometimes in yoga that's called palm tree as well, but it's the tree swaying so you can't sway you can't sway if you're lying down, but you can clap your hands together and stretch your hands and fingers. Now, three and four is a little more tricky. That is a spinal a spinal whole whole torso stretch okay. Okay, and so what you do you're putting your feet flat on the floor, while you're lying there you putting your arms out to the side, like a ti position. you're pressing your lower back against the floor and then you're raising your lower back just a little bit. to stretch the spine. And then you lower it back down. And then you curl into a ball that's five and six. That actually feels really, really good, I recommend that, when she feels really. And then you can also role and a half a ball, in other words. Put one knee into the chest and raise lift your head a little bit and then alternate but the other knee and to the chest and lift your head a little bit. And then, nine and 10 and yoga are called cat and cow. nine is called cat you have your cat right there with you, I see you've been doing pet therapy, while we've been talking. that's excellent so it's like an angry cat arching its back or sleepy catch stretching its back like that. feels really good feels really good. And then the other one is the opposite it's called cow, which I think is kind of silly but you're supposed to look like a cow out in the field with a sway back right so you're relaxing your back and. Lifting your head up toward the ceiling. Okay, so you're just relaxing your back down so it's like sway back and then the opposite is to arch the back, which is called cash."
14665.0,Patient,"Okay, I think those are all my man."
408.0,Provider,"Good good. Now the next 111. And then the slides slightly more advanced posture I would recommend you not do that one for a while until you're a little stronger because you're you're balancing your weight on one knee and one hand and it looks easy but it's actually not. It takes a string now it's a great stretch, but it works, the buttocks muscles right you're holding that leg up with your buttocks but if you're not. already stretched out you could stretch your lower back out a little bit, so I wait on that one until you've done some of these other postures for a week or two. i'm often called tiger. Running tiger running tire because it looks like a four four legged animal running okay. All right now the spinal twist is the twist I was mentioning this feels great just be sure you do it very, very slowly and gently. Alright, so you're lying down, you can start like posture 12 with your knees up and your bottom raised off the ground, or you can just start flat."
14665.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,With just your knees on the floor and then you fold your needs to the right and we look to the left.
14665.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,it's so it's a twisting motion we're actually having a little spinal twist. Does that make sense.
14665.0,Patient,yeah makes sense.
408.0,Provider,"And then you bring your knees back up to Center and then you put them to the other side, and then you look you look in the opposite direction from where your needs are and that that's having a gentle spinal twist."
14665.0,Patient,"Thank you, like, I can do this."
408.0,Provider,yeah just be slow do it very slowly don't let your daughter rush you.
14665.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,"All right, and then we have the leg lifts to leg stretch. Where you're you're basically you know stretching one straight leg now you saw earlier one. Where you were. Just kind of one knee into the Jesse this one, the seven and eight was the knee bent knee, and this is the same thing, except you're straightening the knee. don't expect that you'll be able to pull the leg that far back at first right. Now just just you're just going to reach up and you might not even be able to reach your leg, the first few weeks just lift your leg up and point it bring it towards your face to the point of gentle tension. OK OK, and the same and, eventually, you might be able to get to pasture 16. don't worry about don't feel like you don't have to grab your leg you don't have to grab your calf or your ankle or your toes just just point delay kind of bring it slowly towards your face to the point of general tension. Again that's an excellent lower back stretch and also back of the legs, if you have any pain in your hips in your pelvic area it will help all of that. And then you do the same thing on the side so you're rolling over onto one side and lifting the leg up from the side you say, and then you roll over to the other side and do the same thing."
14665.0,Patient,"Now, in my hips hurt at the post 17 already."
408.0,Provider,You do 17 already but it's painful.
14665.0,Patient,"Well, it helps ease the pain."
408.0,Provider,"Oh, it does work okay good good good."
14665.0,Patient,When I hit start hurting that I get down on the floor and do that we're not ready. To post but.
408.0,Provider,"See you didn't even know what you were doing yoga already miss boss. See. And then there there's the resting Polish where you're all you're doing is lying on your stomach lying flat on your stomach that's a yoga pose. Well yea Now you can say i'm doing yoga and you're taking a nap yes. But the but the trick is, you see where the head and neck are right. yeah you're slowly turning your net to one side, and then to the other, and that is actually an extra. Okay, because you're lying flat on your stomach. With your arms with your arms extended. Okay okay. i'm not gonna we're not going to show you the next one, yet all right, and then they're the ones that I started off with. Okay, see those shoulders neck roles. Then we have. 14 is for the future for. it's a trunk twist so you're standing and essentially you put your head to to look over your right shoulder. And then you're actually turning your whole upper body. In a gentle twist. And then the same thing look over your left shoulder and then gentle twist to the left. We won't go into some of those that here is a seated posture called cobbler pose or Taylor suppose 21 and it's just what it looks like you're putting the soles of your feet together. And here, you just bring them in, then the feet as close to your your lap, as you can without pain, so it depends on how how far you're allowed to bend your knees, so to speak, right. Because of all the way and then your knees, are going to be completely at full range of closure, but if you bring a little bit out there'll be at 45 degrees 90 degrees, the knees i'm saying see. So if you have any any knee issues. don't try to bring the feet real close into the body. Okay, just put the souls together and then you lean over you fold over your feet as far as as comfortable. Okay, and that's a great backstretch. Do you have any issues."
14665.0,Patient,um no not really.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then this one, you can probably bring them in pretty close without bothering anything and then you'll get the benefit of the backstretch as you gradually lean over."
14665.0,Patient,All right.
408.0,Provider,"All right, and then. 2223 24 you can see what you're doing is folding over one leg with the other leg bent in. Okay, and then you switch, then you switch to the other leg right now that stretches a whole bunch of muscles, the whole lower torso and all the leg muscles, particularly if you remember to keep your foot flexed. When I do this posture that this is a great one. Okay, and then the last one looks like you're just lying down taking a nap but guess what that's a yoga posture to."
14665.0,Patient,convey that one for sure.
408.0,Provider,"There you go see, and so what you doing with that one, most of us know you're lying there and you're not just lying there like sometimes you do in bed, where you have all these intrusive thoughts just running through your head and you can't even get to sleep. yeah so what you're doing and post 25 is you're actually practicing slowing down your thoughts. And you're practicing a mindful observation of your body somewhat like we do in group, you know there's exercises we do in group with breathing. Yes, and body awareness so that's what you do when you're in this post of asana. Okay you're breathing you're slowing down you're breathing you're scanning your body you're relaxing each group of muscles group by group. Okay you're letting go of any thoughts that are rushing into your mind which they will write the thoughts will rush in a minute you're doing nothing. yeah that's okay you're actually exercising your brain in letting go of the rushing thoughts. and You may find this surprising to think about but it actually is an exercise for your mind that, as you do this pose over and over and practice, more and more. Directing your attention mindfully to something else, like your breath and letting go of those rushing thoughts that your mind actually does become more calm and clearer okay. And there are fewer rushing thoughts yeah if you are rushing thoughts, so that once you get good at this when I get good at this, I mean. Once you train your brain to do this. it'll help you at that time to fall asleep more easily."
14665.0,Patient,yeah and.
408.0,Provider,It is real it's a real thing.
14665.0,Patient,That would be nice if it were.
408.0,Provider,"All right now that's a lot of a lot of information about mindfulness yoga poses all at once and yeah you won't remember all of them and that's fine, some of them you're already doing. But I just wanted to give you the kind of introduction, so that the ones that you do remember you and your daughter can start with."
14665.0,Patient,Thank you.
408.0,Provider,"Good and I would suggest that maybe you start that way, instead of with the yoga video because yoga videos are often very fast paced."
14665.0,Patient,yeah that's what I think it was my mom telling me that the other videos we're probably going to be too advanced their yoga mats we bought have pictures of poses on them.
408.0,Provider,Oh good.
14665.0,Patient,Those rather than do a video first.
408.0,Provider,Well that's nice opposes the ones that I just showed you.
14665.0,Patient,"To be honest, I know I noticed that Calvin the cat and the cat I know. And, but I have it like really, really looked at and she's looked bad um and she's played around on it, but I haven't fully looked at it yet."
408.0,Provider,And then maybe you can just remember some of the ones that we went over and over over again in our next session and. you'll learn a few more you know just a few of them at a time. But try to do them consistently if you can do them. Three times a week four times that would be great.
14665.0,Patient,Okay that's what I was gonna ask me to come through.
408.0,Provider,To do you start with three or four times a week so i'm so good. For you. Yes. yeah yeah.
14665.0,Patient,Part of life.
408.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah so that'll be a great motivator well nice to see you again for our next individual session on October the 23rd are you available at three o'clock Saturday."
