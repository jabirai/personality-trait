105.0,Provider,So how am I finding you today.
3453.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,and any. Major swings in mood or stress level over the last week.
3453.0,Patient,i'm.
105.0,Provider,Not a loose year but it's probably sounded crazy on your end.
3453.0,Patient,"i'm so kind of yeah. um. i've just been getting like. October is my favorite one so i've been trying to keep like really high spirits. And like do all the fun things that, like, I want to do with anastasio and take her to the pumpkin patch and take your you know, to go see the Aspen trees change and i'm so i've been trying to do things like that to keep my like. My um my bubble, you know kind of to keep me from. from getting down but um I have been just kind of getting upset pretty much like every day just thinking about my my am my friend that got arrested for murder, the other day. it's really so so sad it's so sad."
105.0,Provider,So you are trying. To use distraction. You know your your daughter doing things with her as often been a an effective distraction. And do you want to take some time and process some of all the maybe. thoughts that are going around what happened with your friend it's a complex thing what happened.
3453.0,Patient,"yeah um. I guess it's just I always saw him because, like out of all of the. The friends that I had that didn't have a chance pretty much. Like all of all of us that never got anything handed to us. And he was the one I always saw making it for himself doing something with his life, even if it was just an average job I never saw him going down the path that he would so. By now, I would have thought he was so into bikes I would have thought he would have been like a motorcycle mechanic or something. and I had met him when I was 11 and we were friends my whole high school teenage years, and when I was 16 he started to still in cars we lived in a homeless shelter together and everything. For for a year. for about a year we lived in a homeless shelter together um. And he was probably besides, you know my dad who was our relationship was rocky at the time the closest person in the world to me."
105.0,Provider,wow.
3453.0,Patient,"He was very, very important to me um. He was like a brother I love him a lot, I really I haven't seen him in years um we had a falling out because of my dad passing. When my dad died him and my dad went really close to. Okay, and so. There were times, where he lived with us on and off because he didn't have anywhere to go and my dad loved him so much and so he would literally tell him anytime for the night anytime you need to in place to say just come off video i'll take care of you, whatever. So when my dad died, it was around the same time. My little sister decided that she was going to go and. Take his virginity. And so, he kind of fell in love with her, but she didn't want him for anything she didn't want him she just was bored because that's how she is and so instead of coming to my dad's funeral he stayed away. Because of her. And that hurt me, really, really bad that he wasn't there, not only because they were close, but because I really needed him and I thought that that was more important than like. You know. Whatever stupid little thing was going on a time. with him in her. So yeah. The last time I saw him was he was yelling at my sister and getting mad at her, and he suddenly all of a sudden notice that I was standing in the same area. And he kind of like look at me and saw that I was just kind of like looking at him and he had told me i'm sorry to come to your fucking dad's funeral like very hateful and like it didn't mean anything to him. And so that's the last time I had seen him. and spoke to him, it has it's been a while, but. him doing what he did, and everything kind of brought up a lot of. Old stuff and emotions and feelings."
105.0,Provider,what's his name what's your friend's name.
3453.0,Patient,His name is Jay.
105.0,Provider,ELISE yeah I do not think the way he delivered that information to in that moment. I don't think that was. him not caring about your dad not caring about you. I don't. That was that moment with your sister.
3453.0,Patient,yeah it's just in the time I just lost him. And it felt very insensitive.
105.0,Provider,"It now Oh, he made a mistake the delivery was just terrible. Just right."
3453.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,He was angry sounds like at your sister.
3453.0,Patient,"I was angry at her too. I understood why he was mad at her, I was angry at her to."
105.0,Provider,You have a lot of years of history with Jay. don't you think you can trust that you know who he is.
3453.0,Patient,"Now you know, a side of him that nobody else those. he likes to put the the macho man. doesn't take shit from anybody type of person, but. he's such a sweet kind hearted person. And that's why it's so devastating to see like where he is and like what his his addiction and you know impulses have gotten into. I wrote him a letter I haven't sent it yet."
105.0,Provider,So this he is he's only in the arrest phase is that right.
3453.0,Patient,"um he is being detained until they can get him a trial, let the person that he shot did die. Why, he did that. that's just not like him that's not like he he he. He was very big about he went in me and like kickboxing and and he was super strong like he knew how to fight and if there had been some kind of altercation. I just don't ever see him pulling a gun out and shooting somebody that's just the farthest thing if you would have asked me 10 years ago I would have never. Never."
105.0,Provider,But that's Jay your friend remember what what.
3453.0,Patient,I was thinking about that.
105.0,Provider,What addiction does is something very different.
3453.0,Patient,"And time. he's been a long time that he's been doing the ship is better on math for a really long time. doesn't even look like the same person anymore, it was so handsome. is a big huge 187 tattooed crosses neck like very. Closely now and, like. Just things that he'll never be able to erase that aren't him. it's just crazy what like drug us dude people. i've witnessed that too many times thing the way drugs change people."
105.0,Provider,"makes me think about sometimes i've listened to people, and I wonder if. Prison has saved. yeah some of these lives, I know, it seems so strange."
3453.0,Patient,"No, I agree with you."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
3453.0,Patient,"Because I think it's it's my brother's better off there my brother my real brother my brother Bobby he has like 25 more years to go and he has a job and he's getting like his degree and, like all kinds of shit there. And it's like things that he would have never done. He out here because he was too busy doing stupid shit. So yeah I agree with you, I thought about that all like everything we've talked about so far, and probably everything we're going to talk about has ran through my mind 100 times about it. yeah I overthink it."
105.0,Provider,But without the overthinking. Is that where the letter came from that it was just you love him and you want to reach out.
3453.0,Patient,"um yeah I know that. Yes. I mean, and everything that i'm saying is like mean you already said things that i've known from the past I don't know his current situation but. If if. If things are anything like the way they were and. kind of hints me to believe that it is because he's doing bad he doesn't have anybody right now on his side. Like his mom his dad his brother they've never really been there for him, so I know for a fact that he's not getting any letters from them. So I kind of just was like you know. You don't have to write to me because he was never a writer leader doesn't wasn't as strong suits I told them, I just wanted you, you probably don't have any paper yet, and so I kind of just told them that I I miss him and I wish things window escalated the way that they did, and that. I hope he's staying busy because I don't want him to just stare at walls. That will not do good for your mental health. and here's a very short letter, it was like a page and like a half. of just you know. talking to him the same way that I would feel sitting right next to me. It was very like loving he doesn't need anymore. You know who actually doesn't need lecturing he doesn't need any of that that's not gonna help."
105.0,Provider,"Well, I hope that he is able to. Let his brain heal while he's in there. Because there's going to be depression, a pretty bad one coming his way."
3453.0,Patient,Without the mascot out.
105.0,Provider,To oh.
3453.0,Patient,"he'd been in jail for a year yeah he just got out three months ago. So I think I don't I don't i'm not saying you're wrong i'm saying that it's kind of crazy that he's back in there, but. I would start getting depressed if I had a two counts of murder in the first degree. facing charges like. yeah I agree. I was thinking about sending him a picture of my dad. Maybe he liked that."
105.0,Provider,What were the things that he was good at that he he sort of let slide and didn't pursue.
3453.0,Patient,"That boy, could you know, make a motorcycle work with a rubber band and an orange pill."
105.0,Provider,Like he was.
3453.0,Patient,"He was amazing. He always had motorcycles that he would pick up in a junkyard dirt bikes. And fix them and that specific aspects, you can see, in his crimes because he has like 15 or 16. Grand theft auto charges and all almost all of them are motorcycles. So um he loves bikes he could have been an amazing bike mechanic could have been building like choppers and and stuff like those guys on TV. um. He could have been an MMA fighter. Oh God she feels like i'm morning him really does."
105.0,Provider,look like that.
3453.0,Patient,"I guess i'm just morning what he could have been because he could have been. I saw so much in him, he had so much light in him, they had in snuff TIM out all the horrible shit that had happened to him due to his parents being negligent and you know, like. not paying attention to him, like he could have he had so much more than what he us just a little asshole like. he likes to show off and that's how that stealing bikes things started what's he like to impress people we wanted. People to think that he was cool hey. stealing anything. He just like stealing keys to break into people's cars to still there, change in their cup holder. He could have been alive. With the skills that he had considering you know me had a seventh grade education. He could have made something of himself."
105.0,Provider,I hope you right back.
3453.0,Patient,"I guess we'll see. i've always so scared or feeling like i'm gonna bug somebody or like i'm bugging people but it's like he doesn't have anybody to talk to so. it's not it's partially, for me, of course, why i'm writing it is because I I would love to think that he would want to write me back."
105.0,Provider,"Well, if you can manage that attachment to outcome because there might be some disappointment there. There might be, but if you can manage that. And just give what you yourself would want just. Being a friend to your to your old friend Jay not version that's. been a survival he's had to adapt a version of self it's a survival."
3453.0,Patient,mode said that in the letter. I just. I want him to know that there's people out here that care about him. that's important I don't want him to fill.
105.0,Provider,Do you feel that way at least yeah sometimes do you feel that alone.
3453.0,Patient,"i'm not necessarily like a low. But um. there's just some times, where like my brain will tell me that no one cares about me like no one actually cares about me. They just pretend to."
105.0,Provider,One was a recent moment.
3453.0,Patient,"few days ago, it was happening more in September was happening a lot in September."
105.0,Provider,that's a hard month that month. But a couple days ago.
3453.0,Patient,yeah like two days ago.
105.0,Provider,What was the trigger what was the activating event.
3453.0,Patient,For mom. mom yeah she's one of the main people who can like immediately make me feel bad. Because it won't just be about her it'll be about everybody. Because if I feel like my mom doesn't really love me how can I trust that anybody else does. is like the thought process.
105.0,Provider,it's a flawed thought process.
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"It still feels real you start casting doubt you sort of almost put your mother's face on everybody else's body, as if their. Unconditional love or. Their ability to be trustworthy is this problematic is the one with your mother, but. They are not her. And so that's."
3453.0,Patient,"Like I overthink everything else, but that you know. I go like if someone who's my mom is supposed to like love me more than anybody, and like and and have this specific range of. Safety feeling with her makes me feel this way like someone that so like supposed to be so worried to me, then, then like, how can I trust that I mean what else does you know. But I definitely feel like she's the trigger 90% of the time. And it does make me fat have that same distrust and everybody else but it's really. Her."
105.0,Provider,And you've gotten more distance from her.
3453.0,Patient,"feels like i'm able to think more clearly. About like the list situation when i'm not right there she's so easy like to manipulate me when we're in the same home. it's really easy for her, I immediately break it's really hard for me to. not give her the reaction that she wants to get out of me or. or whatever it may be a. lot easier to think they see things for what they are when i'm not right next to her. she's already been telling me she wants to move in. that's not happening, but. her and her husband have been fighting so she thinks that that's her cue to move into my own. she's done that, like there was one time, where she left her husband and being working we're about to go to Vegas. It was the year before we had the baby so in 2019 December 2019 we're supposed to leave on the 13th to go to Vegas for five days. And we had consolidated all our debt and like refinanced our car just to go, because he really wanted to go and we wanted her payments below where we both just turned 21 and so. I think, like a week before we were supposed to leave my mom called me and said she was leaving her husband and didn't have anywhere to go, so that meant we had to use our Vegas money. To put her in a hotel for a month and a half. it's like $100 a day. And it was us paying it most days, she had people buy her like weeks here in there, like her friends who rich friends would buy her like a week here and there, but. it's spent over like 1500 dollars on hotel rooms for her and food and, like everything. And then, when we got back she went right back to him. Like like after after Vegas and then like two more weeks, the money ran out she went way back to him so it's just free vacation on my dime."
105.0,Provider,So. Have you shared that with her how you actually feel.
3453.0,Patient,"Oh yeah because she called me one day I was at my job. And she was all hey i'm going back with kane and my phone's getting shut up I don't have survey, so the last time we're going to talk for however long you hung up on me and I speak your for like one. She didn't bother calling me because she knew it was fucking bullshit you know, I was really upset about it because. Why am I going to pay for you to stay in a hotel for a month and a half, just so you can go back like what's the."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, but this, this is not one of your examples of having shared your feelings."
3453.0,Patient,"So far, i'm."
105.0,Provider,"assumptions, but not shared i'm just checking in just to see doesn't mean we're going to stay there at that thought, but i'm just curious."
3453.0,Patient,yeah. you're right.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I just wanted to check so let's go to something you said before that, which was it ain't happening so i'm wondering where that confidence comes from. That you know how you would set that limit with her knowing how adept she is that manipulation on little things. you're not living together and she's still cooking you even two days ago I don't know what it was, but you just now said that isn't happening how where does that confidence come from. That she's not going to move in."
3453.0,Patient,that's not happening. Right now.
105.0,Provider,that's it that's the one see how confident you are.
3453.0,Patient,"If you call do it'd be a lot easier for her to it would be harder for me to say no, it would be harder for me to. Stand my ground what."
105.0,Provider,"that's why i'm talking about it, I had wondered if you saying it to me is easier that's not going to happen than it is to your mother. And can we talk about that for a minute. This needs to be your values Lisa."
3453.0,Patient,"was like she has his way of making me feel personally responsible for whatever happens start so if something happens to her that it's my fucking fault, because I didn't let her come play like stay at my house. And it's not even like about her staying here is about the bullshit that she does when she was here, he would be here when she lives with me is this, I can I can do that, but it's. That that feeling of like well what if she dies on the street or like what if someone fucking does something or whatever. outweighs it. outweighs my personal comfort me. worrying about the what is."
105.0,Provider,"This is a difficult one. Because you have this same. guilt over somehow not doing something for your father to which you've made some movement around. Intellectually do you know that it is. inappropriate that she emotionally hijacked you and manipulate you and make you responsible as a child, you know, intellectually that that's not appropriate."
3453.0,Patient,"Oh yeah, of course."
105.0,Provider,"And do you accept. The responsibility. Because of the earlier you thing you said, which is. How could my mother not love me how could she not how could she not show me this and so that's what keeps you tethered like if I set a limit should completely just fear, what do you think would happen."
3453.0,Patient,"Like I have to prove that I was being love. And that, like my love is unconditional. So, like. Like I deserve to be loved that way as well, I guess. Because i've always been like that i've always been that person who you know could literally do every single thing that I can for some money that I love down to my last dollar and the shirt off of my back like. I just. I feel, especially when it's her. Because I just thought I heard a love me, and I think it just ties into that, like me, not feeling like she loves me. So, like, I have to like make her lovely and that's, the only way I can do is doing things for because it makes me feel like that's all good for his head doing things for her. Giving her what she needs."
105.0,Provider,"And you're you can keep doing it that way, and you know that except what ends up happening, it doesn't actually fill it doesn't fill you up. You don't actually get to feel I don't think love from her. And the differences is if, instead, you did the thing that she should be doing for you like. saying to you. As your mother don't let someone take advantage of you, it needs to be a shared friendship she can't step back from herself, but if you started doing it for yourself. You might end up feeling more fulfilled. As in at least there's someone it happens to be you the last you."
3453.0,Patient,"know I agree because, like will be times, where she'll call me and and she'll be like she hasn't called me and Dave and she'll call me. range be real chatty Cathy and then she'll be like hey. You have $20 or $40 or $50 below everyone she's asking work. And i'll tell her sure uh you know I keep an emergency stash of money that you know walking will take out of his parent pockets and give me. What color shirt come, you should drive over here, and then, when she gets here it's like she completely fucking ignores me. Like she doesn't like know she'll get here and then she'll. I don't even know how else to describe it she'll ignore me i'll try talking her and it's like the same shit they should you do when I was living with her like boring thing. Like on a whole different level because she's not looking at her phone or anything she's playing with the baby but it's like. you're playing with the baby you can't talk to me like and play with maybe, at the same time. We just don't. It makes me feel like very low and make it that's all she gives a Fuck about so."
105.0,Provider,"Elisa if you. Could park. This typical exchange, you know i'll give you money and my resources and hope that you will like and love me park that for a little bit and just told me. Not even whether she's capable of doing these things but. If you were to say to her what you want, like specifically. we've been doing, you know we've been doing it this way for a while it isn't working I keep thinking, I do these sort of favor type of things. That somehow i'll earn your love and i'll get this attention and it'll stick, but it doesn't stick and I need to do it again and then again and again, but it never sticks. And mom. I would like. This what is it that you want. Like a call a talk a do specifically what would feel good if you were to be clear don't get ahead of whether she could do it or not, but what, what do you want."
3453.0,Patient,I honestly just want to be talked to genuinely. it's it. doesn't have to be anything. Extra doesn't have to be you know phone call or visit doesn't have to be that.
105.0,Provider,"So no hook at the end for a favor no hook there's no agenda it's just she would. Talk to you like, he. cares about how you're doing. yeah yeah. she's I think she's capable of doing that I do."
3453.0,Patient,"it's just one of those things where i've tried to talk to her about it before but it's like for some reason that sense to do so that subject is really sensitive for her gets really mad, and she like like. Like manipulation comes out why like Oh, I have a burden on a piece of shit oh I. Just showed like make me feel bad for bringing it up."
105.0,Provider,That has a term.
3453.0,Patient,Just brought me an omelet.
105.0,Provider,yummy. yummy.
3453.0,Patient,So sweet.
105.0,Provider,So that's. your mother lives in I don't know if you thought about it in a while. She lives in the the drama triangle. mm hmm. So she what she did she did very quickly. Was play the martyr. and write them.
3453.0,Patient,down here. We don't mean.
105.0,Provider,So when you can see it in the moment and we don't often remember in the moment when people are doing it. But it's a very powerful position but it puts you in the persecutor role forces you there is if you're the villain you didn't do anything but because she does that one down martyr position and victim.
3453.0,Patient,The victim here.
105.0,Provider,"Someone has to be the perpetrator. The here's the piece that I want y'all we don't quite get, and that is you don't have to accept when someone gives you the script for the role of persecutor you can say no, thank you, you don't have to accept it, you don't have to do that role."
3453.0,Patient,"yeah it's just you have to have a lot more control over your emotions. and not let the situation at hand. make you react because that's what. Is is kind of being forced upon you, is to react to get upset to get angry and. Because you know, for you know you know that just that factually true. That that you're calling this person, a piece of shit and a fucking burden and you know it's kind of like, why are you putting words in my mouth and so therefore it's one of those things that I really act. On on emotion, because it's like, why are you purposely miss understanding me because that's not."
105.0,Provider,that's anger. So she's got to notice you're now persecutor.
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,I need to get you to be angry.
3453.0,Patient,"During during yeah that's what i'm saying, because. it's really easy for her to get me to do that."
105.0,Provider,"So what is so come way outside of it use imagination, if someone did that to me what would I do."
3453.0,Patient,um. You would. ask them why they're feeling the way the vr.
105.0,Provider,"Well, I wouldn't ask them why I don't ask the word why question but, basically, I would be curious. about what just happened to them right. huh oh what just happened you're having a big feeling."
3453.0,Patient,sort of emotion yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Something just happened you shifted mom. kind of feeling like. something you know you no one's there for you what what just happened. notice that. I do not accept the bid the invitation, the script to be the perpetrator notice I declined. The invitation and therefore I have nothing to defend against all I do is lean in further and find out what just happened, but I do it with compassion. And you're not loving yourself is going to make that very difficult. Because you're wanting to know why would anyone do that brings us right back to the same situation because your answer back to yourself, is going to be the one who started with she's focused on herself."
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"And then, all that history that lifetime history of neglect. I guess activated in yo."
3453.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Especially since a lot more recently, since i've been like i'm like farther in my sobriety and everything. And also like not living with her so like since i've been here i've been thinking, a lot more, and having like memories of things that I forgot happened come up. And so it's been one of those things where i've been like what a fucking bitch. Like, why did you do that to me why like why, why did you do that to me."
105.0,Provider,"So here in this way I gotta tell you this question is so. You tile, you have the answer. answer it and be done with it until five years from now 10 years from now, six years one year go with a story. Because this why why why."
3453.0,Patient,"Why, I mean I don't have the answer because it's like she she I would never do that my daughter like. what's, the answer is she just she was on drugs to she's selfish like it's just there's too many to."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, very often, the simple ones are these theories that never know who was in these groups or not, but typically it comes from. The attachment formation, that your mother had with her own parents with her parents. it's very possible that this is the legacy, this is the transgenerational abuse neglect that just got passed down she learned this drama triangle from her family that's."
3453.0,Patient,What we call merson.
105.0,Provider,"She doesn't know any differently. She doesn't generate self love that's why she's in an abusive relationship that's why those stories, you have those she doesn't have it either how on earth is she supposed to show you what love is when she doesn't have it herself. So she's like my daughter loves me. If she sacrifices and is unconscious it's very, very likely your mother is i'm conscious of what she is doing to you. And she's nowhere going to get conscious if you keep extending your hand and accepting the bid the script. But if you don't look what happens I say. mom. What just happened. We were talking and I was just saying I didn't have 50 bucks and you have your if you're really going through something mom really big like what just happened. notice, I am not responsible, I care actually but look who's responsible for their feeling it's her she's gonna have to investigate it she's going to need to have she will need to look into why that's her business that is for mental space you taking care of you is enough but."
3453.0,Patient,That makes her. More of. That that thought of her being you know it's just what she knows. Is it makes her a lot less of the monster that I that my brain kind of makes her into.
105.0,Provider,"Right that's why this is helpful it doesn't work to have people as villain the same way in parts work that I do with y'all. there's no part of US that's evil either. Okay she's not evil. She has developed parts in her. That exploit exploit the US people it doesn't make her a villain if she had learned how to do something else earlier on, she would have done it and we can have compassion there you're learning it here and to other places, about not passing that along to your child."
3453.0,Patient,"yeah i'm glad yeah my dad kind of counteracted that too, because my dad didn't ask anybody for anything and I felt like I took that too much too."
105.0,Provider,"too far yeah. it's it, the problem is in the inflexibility and extremes we're all a little bit sometimes we you know what one person, you might say, oh it's using someone, then you might twist That, too, I could never ask for help and that isn't it it's constantly sort of moving back and forth and going. What is the reaction of this person i've asked help from. Of i've been asking them and asking them and they don't ever say no, and maybe i'm exploiting now you know it's it's not one or the other, we have to just sort of. move back and forth between these different domains and see how am I affecting people, how is it affecting me. it's not just going to be one thing for the rest of your life i'm just going to be this one thing it moves and flows and changes with the different people that were with at different times in our life, sometimes you'll be more of a giver sometimes you'll be more of an acceptor of help. It is the rigidity that's the problem. I have to be this now, but guess what you notice you're not and then what you're sad depressed and shame activated. yeah you have gotten a lot from being self sacrificing and, as you grow in this work that certainly what you're doing with me it's asking you to not do that it's asking you to. expect more for yourself leave some resources leftover leave stuff in the Cup. But when your whole identity is i'm a self sacrifice, I will give the shirt off my back. that's your whole identity and what therapies doing is it saying. Is that healthy to give everything. And you know it sharply as soon as you apply that to your daughter in the workbook no no it's okay to set boundaries immediately, you can find it by doing that that's a quick thing. yeah and children will model what they see."
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Oh, even though you're gonna say don't deplete yourself and you're going ahead."
3453.0,Patient,and giving all by example.
105.0,Provider,"will follow by example yeah. or they'll do the opposite thing, and you know, so if you can start slowly but surely. Finding the grace in that balance you'll never have it 100% all the time because it's constantly moving that line is moving all the time. But if you can keep in your heart that the philosophy is and we don't say it out loud, but you can be thinking i've got to do this balance of give and take now mom i've got to do it now. And, in a sense, mom you never taught me. But. If you knew how to do it, I bet you want me to know how to do this. I know that's strange, but your mom's not conscious yet so you're gonna have to repair it yourself. And there's love there, you may think i'm going to lose out on this ugly toxic love from mom we don't know that for sure we don't she may get conscious. She may pull back she may disappear, she may not even hear any of the boundary setting I don't know what's going to happen, but you will love you more you will respect you more. You will come away with something from this yeah. I don't know what. I don't know what your mom will do."
3453.0,Patient,Neither do I. I would hope that she would. Understand but.
105.0,Provider,"Honey she doesn't have the skills she's going to be offended and angry because you're changing the rules, probably that's the most predictable thing. Is chill escalated whatever martyr Marta martyr is right, well then she's going to go to persecutor when martyr doesn't work she's going to go to persecutor. So then she's going to put you into victim. And everything that goes in there before so every single time you. decline decline the invitation."
3453.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"mom that looks like it just shifted again huh are you angry yeah. Tell tell me more see I don't it's not mine I don't accept the script that's I don't I have my own. I just come right here. All all i'm just had said i'm not able to give that right now I can't I don't have the 50 bucks to spare. And mom you're you've gone through what looked like big emotions what's happening for you what's going on stay away from why. far away like put it in an envelope and don't say it for a year, like that's how far. As how. that's how questions. What. I know it's strange, but nothing gets someone more defensive than why. Are you doing we're at the top of the hour here we're."
3453.0,Patient,Just taking it all in and thinking about like. How it's going to grow and everything. The next time i'm going to attempt to to try and do things a little differently. Because it's it's um. I can't keep just letting it happen. If it's not making me happy if it's making me upset way that it is they can just keep letting it happen.
105.0,Provider,It isn't just upset upset you get shame activated. You can you start casting doubt on all your relationships it isn't just.
3453.0,Patient,yep so to. come over yeah.
105.0,Provider,"This is big it hits hard. yeah versus a dog on it my mom isn't conscious yet boy I wish, she would be nice to have an adult friend in my mother boy, it would be nice that she was on a mission, but you know what it isn't happening. accepted. But doing what you always did is continuing to reignite the shame. But asking why, why would she do, why would anybody do this there's already an easy enough answer until she wants to come up with another one and share it with you."
3453.0,Patient,yeah. Just to some of the important part you.
105.0,Provider,"Know it's it's it's about how you make meaning of her behavior what you do next, and again I make it seem very easy, was it."
3453.0,Patient,Jerry know.
105.0,Provider,"gently, as you go little nose will be big steps. yeah not taking a call like that could be a know like oh I should pick the phone up. I don't have that to give do I know I don't say you don't pick it up might not even be verbal but your nose might be very subtle stuff not the ones like I can name it out right in front right, I can just do that but. we're talking about years they're going to be incremental because you're going to need to come back and see Am I Okay, am I terrified i'm going to lose my mom forever what's happening to me, you know you just do tiny itty bitty ones, and then keep telling me. Once you did, and if we need to come up with phrases and things on how to go about it and then we'll role play okay don't expect all at once this stuff we just talked about to be remembered, because it's going to be highly emotionally activating."
3453.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I do know that I need to stand up for my boundaries, though, and i've been letting people cross over those boundaries for way too long. Just because my mom does it, you know. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"you're getting better, though I mean you are making progress there. From what i'm hearing."
