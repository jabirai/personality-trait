759.0,Provider,"Have yeah it was actually a big group. And normally isn't that big it should only be about 12 people so most and it's a big group so yeah like it, it was hard trying to get through everyone and before the time was up but."

And whatnot um yeah and I guess i'm just sort of feeling a little bit of the havoc from the holidays it's. A lot. always like for a person like me who gets anxious pretty easily. it's just always the. list of the constant to do's you know i've got to do this and that and I feel like i've got to pull myself in multiple places, but what I kind of wanted to chat with you most about today was. I mean, I guess it's good to like kind of dive into some stuff about my mom. And I had unless you have other questions or."
759.0,Provider,"i'm not sure, but yeah yeah this is your time, so you tell me what you want to talk about. The only thing I also have with us for us to map out treatment plan for you. Some goals that you might have for Derek P start where you want to start today."
16241.0,Patient,"cool well yeah I had an encounter with my mom last night so since since like fresh on my mind, I thought it would be good to discuss it, because I can only talk about it with my boyfriend for so long, until he gets overloaded. yeah but i'm helping her with this like reverse mortgage right helping her slash i'm like doing it for her i'm. filling in for applications i'm. Getting all the necessary recordings and documents that are needed from county like I mean doing everything. to the point where I even have to say i'm her on the phone, so I can get information and she just is not capable i've tried calling with her some times and she just gets. So paranoid and she's unofficially diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so she just doesn't do well in these situations at all. So i'm doing everything, and I know that she's got brain power enough. to recognize that i'm doing this for her, but when I do bring up questions like hey mom did you receive that letter in the mail that I requested that we've been waiting for. She instantly gets triggered, I imagine, because she just starts to she has like a negative attitude towards me her tone of voice will change now Hilary. Like like scolding meal like I don't want to hear about that don't you worry about that you know she she instantly turns on this other persona. As opposed to. Being grateful and appreciative that her daughter is doing this entire process for her and. mean I spent thousands of hours I. I flew from across the world to come and help her with this and I just don't feel appreciated or acknowledged at all. yeah and. Luckily, I do from other people like my boyfriend and family members, I mean my family more so, even his family, I just. i'm just getting really sick and fed up with the fact that, like I run out of energy and motivation to continue the project for her when. You know, like even last night I ended up was walking out of her house feeling and you can't acknowledge me i'm just going to go. And I know that she has a mental illness and I know this, they need to have more patient and say recognized but it's just so hard for me it's like i've got 35 years of history with her it's not like this is a fresh brand new. issue like my my challenges with her and I don't know I guess i'm just trying to recognize like i've found a lot of different tactics in my life of trying to communicate with her, I even like join this program called nami. Where I was. able to try to understand some other with ways of maneuvering conversation, to make it productive and proactive and. I gotta try it like how do I. check myself and remind myself like Oh, make it funny or make this light hearted Hillary because then I get triggered and then I start hearing my voice, and I even said, and all I can ramble off as like why don't you appreciate me or why don't you acknowledge me. And that doesn't work for her. And it sucks so even today I got an email saying oh. it's time for your appraisal for the reverse mortgage. Here go ahead and make your first deposit. And of course i've got to pay for it, because she doesn't even have a card she doesn't even know how to do this shit online. yeah me being impatient and immature at the moment I forwarded the link to her, I was like here you go, since you don't acknowledge that I do any work for you. And since you just think it's uncle David who does everything for you and you don't appreciate me. here's your link figure it out have fun like your deadline is in a week, you need to figure out how to get an appraisal and it was really wrong of me, and I was angry, but. It was the it was bad timing of like getting this email after having it okay like not a huge argument, but some type of. Dino heated discussion with her last night, so I don't know I felt guilty about it later, but. i'm just so tired i'm like reading this book right now about how it's called you to you by Sarah knight it's really referencing like for you to do the things that bring you joy and bring you pleasure."
759.0,Provider,yeah that.
16241.0,Patient,"You know, all these kind of. Not myths, but these things that were. were like socially conditioned with. You know these phrases like family first or. don't be selfish off sharing is caring, like all these things that yes, it hindsight it makes sense, but there's also such boundaries to that to to. Family first until it starts hindering your life. Or, yes, sharing is caring. Until you. really need to put your own mask on before you put on someone else's to help the whole situation or you know, like there's other guidelines that aren't always necessarily discussed or talked about."
759.0,Provider,So on the diction.
16241.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so like this book and I guess it just kind of got me a little hot headed thinking that like yeah I don't know I I I shouldn't have to do this for my mom it's it really doesn't benefit me in my life and. i'm doing it for the whole her, but the whole rest of the family it's like I don't want this House, I could give a shit less about this House that i've pretty horrid memories from a child from, and I only am. Helping to save the House with this reverse mortgage to give her a home to give her a roof over her head and i've been working at it for a year and a fucking half like it's not just like a couple week process like i've been really putting my whole life. On this and i'm i'm getting so tired Nada and I I you know I don't receive any kind of appreciation my sister my dad and all these people. who may end up actually living in the House someday are actually benefiting from the. house, and I mean I can't put in the future, maybe I do end up living there, but I don't want to i've. No plans of staying in sonoma i've no plan I want like a property and. I want to build a home and have a farm and animals like I don't want to be in some downtown sonoma proper like. yeah so I don't know I just i'm just getting really flustered and frustrated and tired and I know that's when it's time for me to like have me time. We have one day. I put the email side today, and I mean after I angrily forwarded it to my mother, of course. But usually i'd work on that and start filling out the application form and send in the deposit and give my card information and I usually start doing that first thing in the morning and I put it aside and I did other things for me today."
759.0,Provider,"Well that's a that's a good start, you know, like today, you put this side you know Indian you gave yourself what you needed, which is meantime you know you gave yourself permission just come back at that leader, he and now like into topic later yeah sorry I didn't mean to cut you off."
16241.0,Patient,"Go no I just don't know what else to do, I feel like i've like. Then, and my boyfriend so great, he, like really reminded me he's like she has a mental illness, she doesn't understand how she probably thinks, you know, in her brain that. you're her daughter and you're not supposed to be helping her, and so the role reversal doesn't work for her brain and it's not that she doesn't want to appreciate you but it's me that she just really truly mindfully can't and it's she's such a great reminder, you know to. To encourage me so that I know that maybe is not intentionally I just take it so personally, you know it's like. The simplest little cooperation even or she doesn't have to get on her knees, and you know kiss my fee I just. I would just like her to be like yeah I did receive that thing in the mail or I never received it, I bit weird you know, like I. Just won't be able to actually talk about stuff she's in such a fantasy world it's the same with her drug abuse like. i'm a grown fucking woman now you know i've also tried my different array of drugs and i'll tell her like yeah mom i've done LSD and yeah you know i've i've also tried stuff, but I have only experimented, to the point where I I don't take it very far because I don't want to get addicted. And i'll say that in front of her like. my sister has a drug history of math so does my mom we don't talk about my mom's, but we can talk about my sister's, of course. So bring it up and i'm like I wanted to like mom whatever happened with you exactly like you know, like how long did you do speed and in math and Hillary I did not do that, like she will legit erase it from the brain. yeah not allow me to take a step further and she starts to scold me or yell at me. for bringing in the past. And i'm sorry but it's the truth. And she'll be like you. Remember the bad things and i'm like well let's help me remember the good things, then by talking about it."
759.0,Provider,yeah I.
16241.0,Patient,"won't go there and Karen my boyfriend's like I know that she's the one person that you want to talk about that with in order to heal and she's the one person that you want to get acceptance. And or appreciation from during this reverse mortgage in order to move forward, but you just got to realize you can't from this person and. it's like, how do you cope with that, how do you deal with it's almost like the closure of the ex boyfriend or the ex husband or something that you're never gonna i'm never going to get right and you just have to. move on, I don't know like i've been trying to cope, for years now, and I I finally have gotten to the space from like mom does won't talk about drugs Okay, but it took me years. And so now i'm like. In the midst of these waves of this reverse mortgage ocean and I, like all I want is your cooperation and we can bond over this, you know, like i'm not. Judging her that i'm helping her with this it's it's a difficult thing like I understand how it's not an easy concept but to gather records and documents. I need our help and she's not doing that, with me, she won't show me anything that comes in the mail she'll take a straight to my uncle even if we're in the same room together. So take it to my uncle. And he legit turns to me and goes i'm giving this to Hillary because hillary's doing all the work and juice okay anyway uncle David you look at it like she just shut."
759.0,Provider,The missus you yeah. completely.
16241.0,Patient,"And it really hurts my heart it's like mom like i'm. super dedicating my life to this and. I don't have to do anymore I don't know how to like finding the patients within my heart, like I get so many compliments from people that i'm. Patient and that i'm saying like you know when it comes to helping others and i'm really selfless, but when it comes to her the one small comment, and I just lose my lid I can't hold it anymore. I know."
759.0,Provider,"It all has to do with the way that you are your upbringing, with her, you know dealing with her as a child and and now you've gotten, to the point where the roles have reversed, where you're the take. caregiver basically essentially you know you're the one that's taking care of her financial needs as it comes to the reverse mortgage. And it's hard, because your mom has a severe medical condition, where she's not able to kind of respond in the ways that you would may want her to respond and the same thing that goes back to what your boyfriend's telling you like, she has a mental illness but doesn't help. You with kind of like that acknowledgement because you're just wanting to be wanted to be a subset you know by her and just say. Like appreciate it, you know, the fact that you are basically helping her but. Her kind of like nonchalant. You know hillary's here, but she you know she's just here to be here type of behavior or type of you know, knowledge meant, you know from her is hurting you."
16241.0,Patient,"know what I mean she'll beg to differ, but I did a lot of caretaking for her when I was younger too. yeah like so in my mind there isn't a role reversal."
759.0,Provider,Oh so there's not really a role reversal it's like you've been doing this for a really long time.
16241.0,Patient,"I had to wake her up to carpool for the neighborhood otherwise she'd sleep through. i'd have to like I came home and I had to tiptoe around her you know schedule or her emotions, in order to get things done, because."
759.0,Provider,"we've been doing this for a long time and. And it's probably finally catching up to you, or maybe it's been years in the making, where you're just frustrated at this point. You know, because you don't get any appreciation like this person doesn't acknowledge you and the fact that you're willing to take care of them and. You know, and not appreciate you as a person, you know, so I mean since the roles haven't been reversing you always kind of have been privy to taking care of her. You know, like it's it's hard for you now to establish kind of like the boundary with her if you don't you very much want to stop is a boundary but, since she has his medical condition is kind of like where do I begin, you know because is. She gonna. ban this boundary if I say no mom you have to take care of this when I know that she in fact can't take care of you know something as simple as having a card to make the first what payment. yeah so it's it's hard."
16241.0,Patient,yeah I know it's I just feel like i'm a little bit at the end of my options here it's either like I just suck it up.
759.0,Provider,"And, for you know, like let it happen what's going to happen to house, if you don't you know. Take care of the other details as far as the reverse mortgage goes, are you can continue to do what you're doing and just know that the fact that she she's not going to give you knowledge men and just accepting the fact that that is the case and that's hard you know."
16241.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"So that's your options, you know those two are options for you so it's either you know you continue to do what you're doing and."
16241.0,Patient,continue doing what i'm doing or she ends up homeless and audra.
759.0,Provider,"So doesn't want to have that option, then you know so it's basically you continue to do what you're doing."
16241.0,Patient,"yeah. And it sucks because I I put myself in the situation you know, like, I was living across the country in the world for a reason."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you wouldn't have to deal with taking care of mom like I did my mentality, I spent my childhood doing I you know. spent many don't like doing this as well."
16241.0,Patient,"But then like distant family like my uncle the only person who has actually really involved in this with me. pretty much reached out to my sister my older sister thinking that she would take more responsibility or something and said that and also, I was in Vietnam says a little hard to contact."
759.0,Provider,yeah I.
16241.0,Patient,got to her. pretty much saying that you know your mom's going to go under and she's going to be homeless unless there's some support here and my sister found a way to contact me and then i'm the one who ended up coming. To help out. So I don't know I know that.
759.0,Provider,fabulous here with the kids.
16241.0,Patient,"he's got four kids but they're all teenagers now like they're grown. Like full grown adults but. She just said, like they're still babies, I mean they don't work. They just play video games and live in our home. And they don't pay her rent they don't pay for their own cell phone bill and they're fucking 20 years old. It was the opposite of how we were raised, I three jobs in high school like. I worked. hard to pay for my clothes my gas and save for college and so i'm a little irritated with the way she's raised her kids because. We wanted she wanted to have a different childhood than us, but then yet she can even like get them to do the dishes for her. So they have no respect for her it's quite sad. yeah anyway, I don't know i'm just trying to figure out like alternative ways like. My boyfriend. Does yeah you know, maybe obviously you just like asked for appreciation from the people who are going to who are not her who are maybe kind of like I feel like I need to get a little appreciation for my sister and and from my dad because. yeah not able to give it to me, I need it, I need this, I need my cup filled a little bit before I can just keep giving out of mine, because i'm. Quite empty, so I need to maybe ask her and be like yeah I need to hear from you more that you appreciate the thousands of hours. That I put in the year and a half of my life that I put on hold. To help mom and I need to hear it from her that she acknowledges me and my efforts because. I don't hear from anyone else unless it's like if a friend will be like hey here's how you do and what do you been up to and i'll give them the full like Manas updated my life and they're like wow you're doing a lot for your mom and. yeah you like Okay, but is it just ego Nada Do I need to just like completely just meditate and not."
759.0,Provider,"Let that cause your. ego I think it's you know, like you knew one who is putting your position where you're not being appreciated by your family and the efforts that you're making it's okay to wind, you know by. I want someone to say thank you, you know I want someone to say to knowledge sort of the fact that I am putting in. All these hours and I spent a year and a half, trying to do this and I were just like you know someone to say thank you and to appreciate my efforts I think that's Okay, you know, like."
16241.0,Patient,"Like I think my my sister when she tends to throw up me is that I have too high, of expectations on myself and others."
759.0,Provider,So I.
16241.0,Patient,"Know she's probably just going to you know put that in my face a bit, but I don't understand what I like. How anyone else would feel my position or if they even accomplished it, to be honest, but. My first time coming out here was 2017 to like. You know sort of. I don't know like reference the situation you know, and then I had to take it to go back so it's been on my mind, since 2017 the fact that. We got to save mom's house by 220 and then I came back you know, six months before to 20 and then the pandemic kit and then you know, like i've been here with her through all that and. So it's been a big toll on me, you know, and I wasn't done with my travels granted i've made the best of it, like, I found. A beautiful partner who i'm totally in love with like there's been some great things that have happened to during this experience of. Being back home, but this is the longest i've lived in California, since I was seven will longest i've lived in my hometown since I was 17 I left to get the hell away from here and we've. got parents and my mostly my mom to go with my mom so. I don't know how to ask that of my sister be like, can you give me some more appreciation."
759.0,Provider,"start there. I think, by you know, like I don't know if your sisters reasonable just to hear you out, you know, like I don't know, do you guys, do you find out she's easy to talk to that she listens to our it's kind of like what type of relationship D half of her."
16241.0,Patient,"We have a great relationship when it comes to certain topics like we can laugh all day when it comes to you know silly silly stuff. or cooking or. You know jokes about the dogs or whatever, but the second I bring up money or mom's house or. The future I don't know Sir she's similar to my mom in the sense that she's really she's not a very good communicator she did admit that recently, though, which is really great because I had Kovac it was thanksgiving and I called and I was like crying on the phone, I was very upset. She like kinda ended up snapping at me and then. She turn. turn the phone over to my dad or whatever, and then she got back on the phone and she said, you know i've realized i'm not very good at communicating. it's you know she's six years older than me she's like it's taken me 40 years to realize but she's now seeing a therapist for like one of the first times in her life."
759.0,Provider,Oh good.
16241.0,Patient,"Whereas i've seen a therapist my whole life because I really support therapy and I think it's all about releasing from the body getting it out. I know, sharing your story like don't don't hold that in. yeah she's done that she's never been a big fan of just counseling and therapy and whatnot so she said she's in the process, and she had only one session so far as the first time she's ever done it. Should one session, and she said that she's found that she's not a good communicator from the one session so that was nice she at least acknowledge that. yeah apologize for just I don't know getting upset at me she's like I didn't mean for it to come out that way i'm not i'm not angry at you for having covert I just was curious and I don't know she just was like asking me all these questions about my vaccine and I don't know but. long story short, is that she admitted that she's not good at communicating and I do love my sister but let's just say that I. We don't she's not someone I would choose to be friends with. Okay, you know, like she's. We asked you, I used to really call her my best friend. But now it's like. We we see things very differently, you know she she doesn't she she's not a big fan of like education. she's. A bit mature, I feel, she hasn't grown up a bit she also got pregnant, so you never really got to be like that young adult learning about herself and her. and her soul, she she's like has no she has no interesting diving deep into her and she'll love to analyze all these other people around her and pointer finger and blame she rarely ever looked inward and is like did I cause that you know and. i'm one that when I get really upset I cry I just like cry buckets and i'm really emotional highly emotional person very sensitive. And my sister is one that. gets angry and she rages, and she gets mean you know with her words in her tones and she'll punch punch things you know she'll hit doors and."
759.0,Provider,will be different opposites yeah.
16241.0,Patient,"Very different you know and. it's, not that I don't care for her and it's, not that I don't. You know, appreciate our past history together, and I mean she helped raise me because my mom really wasn't around, so I looked up to my sister lot for giving me rides or she would. She would make my lunch, sometimes in elementary school or you know, like little things she was she wanted to be a caretaker but. Also once she got a car, she just like was out like I remember never seeing her when she got her license and I pretty much I felt very alone, I felt completely alone as a kid because she got a vehicle and she'd be a boyfriends houses or parties and I never saw her. So she's pretty much kind of been absent from my life, since I was I don't know at least like. Like you know 11 years old. yeah 16 to 17 header permit and she was gone. So I don't know, I have a feeling that the future is going to be really scary for her and I, to be honest, because I know that she wants this House of moms. primarily for. Her kids and her like."
759.0,Provider,"She lives it's kind of like, if you want. This House why aren't you doing anything to save it, you know."
16241.0,Patient,"comment that I made on thanksgiving. But so she started getting snappy with me about she goes Oh, you have coven how'd you get that and I said, well, I hired I hired someone to come help clean mom's House because we're getting ready for this appraisal. So I helped have someone come in higher than I didn't ask them if they're vaccinated and it turned out, they had a coven. And I got it from cleaning house with them and she's like why don't you wear a mask and i'm like because it's we're in close proximity dusting things and talking and we're outside and I was like I didn't wear a mask I don't know i'm like I knew the cleaner it's not like it was a. Totally random person she is a girl I used to work with back in the day, so she was kind of a friend of mine, I was like she was a friend of mine, I really thought that if she thought that she had. A sore throat or anything, she would tell me that she didn't, and so I didn't wear a mask yeah stupid I should have run a mask i'm sorry, but my sister still like scolding me for it."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16241.0,Patient,"You only have the one Johnson vaccine, you need to realize you're not as protected and i'm like I thought I did there I got vaccinated I did something."
759.0,Provider,yeah you did something about.
16241.0,Patient,"This so once she started attacking me. I was like at least i'm doing something to help with mom's house. You know, like. And she's like well i'm gonna it's gonna be my turn next you know, like you're you're giving all this time i'm going to give time you know for for the future and, like there's nothing to really do for the future. i'm The one thing I never know."
759.0,Provider,"yeah you know if there's no house, how can you do for the feature."
16241.0,Patient,"Exactly I know. she's like well, I know that me and my kids are willing to come out there and go cross country and and. And we're going to help them take care of it and i'm like oh you mean you're going to live in it, because you don't have anywhere to go when you come out here, because it's really hard to find housing and California that's what I know she means is that. she's got these kids who are pretty much adults now who don't know how to work, who don't respect her know how to take care of her own House. And she wants to her dream is to come back to California, because she misses it so much she misses the weather so much and. She just wants to be back here so bad, but she doesn't have any kind of setup so she knows that she wants to move into mom's House and you know. and make that work for her and her three kids that are going to probably tag along with her so like my kids are willing to help and i'm like i'm sorry but they're not going to do shit. So i'm the one putting all this energy and time and then I feel I fear my sister is going to now move out. You know, when she when she's ready, you know her last kid is graduating high school this May. And I have a feeling she's just going to be set in a year to just come out and kind of demolish all the hard work that i've put into this, because you get a reverse mortgage you have to have proof and validation that you are maintaining the House. If you don't they will come after you. and take your home. that's one of the. hindrances and the scares of reverse mortgage so you can't just like get this money loan to you and then go on a trip to Hawaii. You know, like. You got to put the money that's loans you Indian home as an investment you got to fix up the backyard you got to get the new stove you got to do these things right so. I don't know I just I don't trust my sister i'm, sad to say, but I don't trust her, and particularly when it comes to money."
759.0,Provider,So. it's going to be hard to kind of get appreciation from her that's what.
16241.0,Patient,i'm yeah yeah right yeah.
759.0,Provider,"it's going to be, I think we should just establish that it's going to be because of the person that she's in then basically her response to you thanksgiving regarding. The House and that she's gonna be doing work later on, but it's going to be minimal work to be done, because he saved the House, he every day. Right, you know, so I think. The validation just might have to come from like he can try with your dad you know, but I think the validation just might have to come with you. And I know that's hard come from you come from the fact that you're willing to do this, you know, because you don't want to see your mom homeless. And to for you to give yourself your own compassion your own kind of validation that i'm doing something, then I appreciate the fact that I can do this right now does that make sense."
16241.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,"I know that's hard because you're seeking external validation or appreciation and you know, like for someone to say thank you and. To knowledge, the fact of what you're doing but it's going to be hard with the people, because your mom has a serious medical condition i'm at the health condition. You know your sisters at the position in her life, where she's not. able to value what your contribution that's your main game, making, and so this is going to have to be self validation but just hard you know."
16241.0,Patient,"How do I do that, like through a meditation or."
759.0,Provider,"Do meditation you can just do it through you know, giving yourself a little bit of compassion, when you feel frustrated so okay to feel frustrated and so okay two separate feelings, as they come up if you feel frustrated and because it is frustrating. And to just acknowledge the fact that. It is frustrating sometimes it's going to interview, and sometimes it's going to sending you the fact that you know the people around you can give you what you need."
16241.0,Patient,And i'm doing it for them.
759.0,Provider,"And you're doing it for them, which is kind of like okay i'm doing it for them, and no one can you know, like give me anything from that. And that's The sad thing. And then, like I said it's okay to be sad it's okay to be frustrated because of it."
16241.0,Patient,"yeah. And it worries me because I don't want to put myself in a position, like i'm i've been working so hard on my boundaries this year because i'm typically a person who's. Not ever been very good about boundaries about saying no boss, that will be like Oh, can you work this extra hour i'll make sure you know, or I just. I don't know if the people pleasing and me, or like the constant caregiving as a child myself or I don't know what is up with me, but I have the hardest time saying no."
759.0,Provider,"You have to work on. yeah you know, like I wish there was a boundary to put in place, you know, for your mom and this whole situation because there should be a boundary I said, you know it's kind of like. Either I don't do nothing, and this Steve becomes homeless, you know, like it's that's just the reality of the situation right, you know."
16241.0,Patient,"Like I feel like. If she would actually cooperate with me, maybe I could set some type of boundaries in the sense of hey i'll do this one thing mom but then you do that thing. yeah but, but she won't even acknowledge it won't even acknowledge or converse with me about me doing the one thing. So we can't even get to step two. yeah you know yeah. it's like shed. So I just have to do all of it. I I I don't want to be that person in the family that you know read about people like me we're like we're overachievers we're type A. were communicated and we're also like kind of a pushover and. I. got a really like pounds. don't want people just thinking oh poor it'll take care of it."
759.0,Provider,yeah like.
16241.0,Patient,"we're never she'll she'll deal with it when the time comes, or so yeah. and"
759.0,Provider,My reason for that person yeah.
16241.0,Patient,"yeah and I am that person with family, I really am like i'm the go getter i'm the Dewar you know i'm the one i'm like the vulture I like clean up all the family messes that no one wants to deal with, and my only result so far of knowing how do you. get away from those situations is it's like the fight fight or flight and I fly I go to a different goddamn country."
759.0,Provider,yeah con.
16241.0,Patient,"But I want to figure out how to be more of the fighter, because at the moment I can't fly away. And whether it's cove it or whether I end up having kids here in America or whatever it is like there's going to be situations and predicaments where I am grounded and kind of centered in one spot and I got to learn how to fight because I can't fly away."
759.0,Provider,I oh.
16241.0,Patient,"I don't know how to do partner dre I don't know how to be like hey No, this is all in doing today or."
759.0,Provider,Oh hey.
16241.0,Patient,Like I don't have any more energy in me and it's not even just about a boundary for that person it's like a boundary for me.
759.0,Provider,Because I have a.
16241.0,Patient,"I have a hard time I go to your class and I have a teacher be like do this and do that, and then I have a hard time being like I can't do that tonight, like, I will try."
759.0,Provider,"I will give 110% and like. yeah. It starts with you even. Before you even you know came out with the words I was thinking has to come from you, setting boundaries with yourself and how much. Like today, you know that email came you decided to focus in on you, you have to do more things like that. You have to do more thing so taking time out for yourself and learning to say no. You know, like we can discuss maybe also you know why you choose to do the people pleasing. hmm you know and that could be a sign of trauma to when people overly people, please."
16241.0,Patient,mm hmm.
759.0,Provider,"And that can be stemming from like your childhood also. Right like again because your childhood was pretty you know, like with everything that went on pretty traumatic. yeah you know so definitely starts with with you you've been able to kind of like set those boundaries for yourself. and learn to say no for yourself."
16241.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"And it takes time, this is nothing that can be done overnight, you know, but you may been big stuff today, you know, and I think that you have to continue to make those steps for yourself."
16241.0,Patient,um. yeah yeah. Now huh.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16241.0,Patient,So what was it about the. What you had in mind for.
759.0,Provider,"Oh today treatment planning, what do you want to get out of therapy, you know i'm asking you like. You know, in terms of processing through the past learning how to establish boundaries, it can be anything you know this is your treatment process."
16241.0,Patient,You know so. I want like.
759.0,Provider,You you know what you want it want your treatment plan to look like.
16241.0,Patient,"Why, like the idea of. Like kind of breaking up the. But like I don't know just trying to understand a bit more of yeah Why do I like to people, please or. And I feel like I guess revisiting my past as much as I know that I don't want to like dwell on it. or stay there very long. But i'd like to to break up and or analyze a little bit of my upbringing in order to understand these qualities that I have now and some of them are great and some of them are and whatever but. I just want to I don't feel I get to really have the floor to talk much about my past because my mom won't go there. And it gets too heated when I talk about my sister my dad starts to feel guilty. You know, like there's only certain people that I can really discuss this with I try to speak with other friends, and then they also feel a little uncomfortable because my upbringing is too different from theirs, and they just start to feel like a lot of pain or sorrow for me."
759.0,Provider,"And then vice versa me tell me that you know your. story is about your past it's kind of different from there, so do know we'll have to deal with that you know. We have to that yeah."
16241.0,Patient,"And then same I feel like I mean, I know that that I definitely like there's a lot of people in this world and i'm by all means not saying that I had the worst childhood, you know, like there's other there's other story, this is what's so helpful about group, I think. Is that you are able to even just see. The difference between you and other people who are willing to share their story and how how much easier, you may have it, you know, and you recognize. how grateful, you are, you know so i'm not trying to say that I was in like the bottom of the barrel, you know kind of childhoods but."
759.0,Provider,"You had a significant traumatic past, and I think it's okay to say that you know, to knowledge that regardless of anyone else has passed. And just just say like you know this was my own trauma, you know, this is my own, you know bike you know challenges and things I went through and my past is not to just finishing one else's you know, but this is mine, you know, in terms of of huggy phil."
16241.0,Patient,"Well, thanks yeah I that's Another thing I need to work on is. Like. I don't know what to call it exactly you'd probably have a better word for it but i've had a lot of people are like being able to really be present in my feelings I guess. yeah I have a tendency to. Like i've had a lot of times, where people have been like Hillary it's okay to be sad or it's okay to be upset you don't have to wash it away so quickly or."
759.0,Provider,"With your feelings, to set your feelings as Dr."
16241.0,Patient,"yeah so. I think I like to really work on acceptance, whether it's. Acceptance of my feelings or acceptance of giving a filling my own cup of appreciation or. Whatever it is but acceptance of my mom acceptance of my sister. Truly acceptance is something that would be great on the treatment plan. Okay, and goals um and then the other thing I really would like to tap into is, I would like to talk about like my sexual history. And just the sense of how it may be, affecting my my intimacy with my boyfriend now and how we've had a like a reoccurring theme of. You know him and I will have sex and then. You know, he he has his own laundry list of issues where either he you know it doesn't get hard and then I feed into that thinking it's my fault that I have i'm not sexy enough for."
759.0,Provider,This yeah.
16241.0,Patient,"And he assures me it's not my fault, and then you know we don't focus on it, and then we try to do something new and then he does get hard, but then he he comes very quickly. to the point where we don't really have like a we don't really get to experience anything together it's not like a real long lasting lovemaking it's like a real quick. And it doesn't feel."
759.0,Provider,Good.
16241.0,Patient,"It doesn't feel intimate you know. And then I tell them, you know, like and he's so good about making sure that I feel good by the end of it, because he doesn't i've told him I have had history of feeling used i've had a lot of men, particularly like. You know I have been sexually active with women to be primarily men and with the men have there's been so many situations where they just come and then it's like that's it okay. yeah you know or they'll be like i'm going to bed si SIA or i'm leaving leaving like leave and i'm like and I won't have the courage or the presence of my feelings even to be angry i'll be like oh it's okay like wipe away whatever. yeah and then it soaks in najera and then like even 15 minutes later i'm pissed or the next day i'm totally feeling like a low self of war there. So i'm like not able, particularly with other people in the presence of other people. I don't know if this has to do with the fact that, when I was really young I wasn't able to be present, with my own feelings with my mom if she was like super angry and upset I had to be the opposite of that in order to balance us out. Because it, you know, two fires in the room, just didn't make sense. So she'd be aggressive and angry and i'd be like whoa mom okay calm down, you know and."
759.0,Provider,"I think that's why you kind of repurpose your feelings today. yeah now because you have learned to do that in the past, you know if I can get away from feeling feelings like I did in the past, because I couldn't feel down. Because if I did something would happen between you know my mom and me, you know, so I think you have learned to repurpose them, you know it's something down, you know as they come up."
16241.0,Patient,"I think it also has to do with the fact that, like i'm really into numerology. And I have calculated my birthday, and it did say that a real strong characteristic of my exact numerology number ended with is that we like to harmonize situations we like."
759.0,Provider,To bring. Balance balance.
16241.0,Patient,"And so i'm like i'm the number two and the number two or people who tend to like even like the actual number itself number two it looks like a servant like a person serving and bowing down. right number two like they're only their needs, they bow like so number two people tend to be servant like to others, and they also bounce back quickly from situations really easily and i've been complimented on both those things where. you're able."
759.0,Provider,harmony and. Then balance out situations as they come up yeah.
16241.0,Patient,"yeah and then i'm also really good at bouncing back from hardships, particularly the hardship about myself i'm like oh no biggie everything's fine it's okay. And then I brought it as a process I go through it, but I. You know, like I got my toe amputated in Vietnam and everyone was like you're already back at work it's been like a month and I went back to work in a cast, with no toe and i'm still teaching kindergarten to Vietnamese kids I was like yep i'm good we're fine. You know, like I. I don't like I don't allow myself to almost process my own feelings because i'm not used to that."
759.0,Provider,"You know just to that yeah. yeah. Well that's good to know about you, you know, like in depth for opening up you know today and just sharing more about yourself."
16241.0,Patient,"yeah I know I get to a real quick now i'm. Like I don't Fuck around i'm like these are my issue. How do we take care of this, you know people have parties will be like be careful. you give me. Your real deep on you know. I think we need the wine actually I just you know I just get deep."
759.0,Provider,So.
16241.0,Patient,yeah but. So I guess Those are some things on my treatment. Okay balls i'd really like to touch base on.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good to know. yeah and i'm just going to say something else, and in terms of your mom and your situation now, you know I want to give you a coping skill, you know, to help you. And I think when the like I said, you know, giving yourself that validation also knowing what you can hold on what you can't handle you know, for that day, you know just going back to kind of. Like is this too much for me for right now asking yourself Those are questions this is too much, if this is too much, can I breaking down two steps you know just giving yourself kind of flight. You know, like I don't have to get I know some tasks you going to have to tackle them as they come up, but if you can you know breaking down to stop so you don't get too overwhelmed with what you're doing you know if that kind of like resonates a little bit with you."
16241.0,Patient,Okay break it down into steps.
759.0,Provider,"yeah like because it sounds like it's becoming a little bit too overwhelming right now for you right so in terms of doing what you're doing, I mean I know you can do it, you can do it all, you know, but sometimes just giving yourself a break."
16241.0,Patient,Okay. I see you're saying.
759.0,Provider,"Give yourself a little bit of a break, if something can be broken down into steps do that for yourself okay."
16241.0,Patient,"Okay that's it that's a good call. yeah what, what can I use that coping mechanism, though, when i'm in the presence of her I don't think so huh."
759.0,Provider,"And no not really with her, I think you know, like it's it's in the way it's kind of like I feel for you, because you know she does have like this medical. You know condition is hard to communicate with her is kind of you know, hard to kind of get a point across to her, especially with someone with paranoid schizophrenia. You know, even just regular schizophrenia, but paranoid schizophrenia, you know and it's it's hard to communicate, you know, for you know, to communicate to her, I think you know just giving yourself, when you do feel frustrated just giving yourself some compassion don't beat yourself up. For feeling frustrated. And just allow those feelings, to come up as they come out for you and just realize, you know, this is the situation. You know just to stop the situation as it is. And just feel like Okay, you know my mom has you know is is basically non communicative towards the fact of my needs in this situation so i'm going to have to accept the fact that she can't give me why I want you know. I think it's just accepting the fact that you may not get that support from her you know ever from her you know yeah and that's just the truth of the matter and the sad I know it hurts and it's it's hard to process, probably for you, at times, you know but. I think just acknowledging that fact and bored in boy did I use the word acknowledgement and acceptance a lot."
16241.0,Patient,yeah. Those are things that need to be worked on right word that keeps popping up.
759.0,Provider,that's the word that keeps popping up yeah.
16241.0,Patient,"Something i've been doing recently i'm not sure if you had any other suggestions, but what i've been trying to do with with people, particularly because. Those are the ones where i'm like oh I just I want I want this thing from that person or, I would like, I would have wanted this person to do this in this situation or that it's always with other people, I feel, and a way for me to. to reflect on it a bit more is to ask myself, have they ever provided that kind of support for me before. Is there an example where they've done this thing that similar to the last thing that I want know so it's like I need to keep reminding myself, like my mom has never really been able to look at my needs ever before her own, so why should I expect it now."
759.0,Provider,Right yeah.
16241.0,Patient,"yeah, but I am doing I wish that she did."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah like I know you were such she did. yeah. yeah. All right, well, can you know work on the things that we talked about today. You know. Give yourself some compassion, you know, in terms of how you reacted to her today, you know you're frustrated, you know just give it don't beat yourself up because of that okay. I want you."
16241.0,Patient,"To call during our therapy session, I think I should even call her back today because I just feel that maybe i'm not in the right space."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. You should just give it time you know nothing is emergency you know. So just give it some time yeah. yeah and remind yourself, this is good practice for you, you know remind yourself that you don't have to always run out in full force you know you. Can you know, take a step back you know, like and when and take some stops if you need Dom and. You know, and just remind yourself of that."
