1825.0,Patient,"hello, are you."
177.0,Provider,Good sorry for the way.
1825.0,Patient,"just doing some harvesting to be like drawing out my stuff and clipping it. ended up getting a pretty good harvest so pretty happy about that, but and i've been. conversing with my buddy Richard. Just on. I don't like his opinion is that if you don't believe in God you've got no moral code that, like our moral code comes from God or whatever. You know there's a lot of. You know cultures that have existed for a very long time, without you know that don't subscribe to your particular brand of religion. You know, like. And it's subjective you know what's good for one person may be bad for another, you know. And like i'm trying to explain to him, like that's like classic indoctrination is that you think that you have some sort of intimate knowledge of something that nobody else has you know and so you're special. You know, and like I you know, like. i'm not like atheist i'm more agnostic you know, like I don't argue that there is no God like I just don't know you know, and I don't believe that it's. What the what the church claims it to be, because there's a lot of. You know, like clear, you know I mean, even in one of the 10 commandments it talks about not making idols of God, you know, even though or even like. That like you see like the first thing you walk into a church, you see a big cross you know it's hanging on people's necks, you know that's an idol of God you're worshipping idols you know and it says not to do that. You know and i've done like a lot of you know, like I know a lot about religion, there was a time where like I even you know was you know went down that Christian path you know, like for myself. You know, but like I just I don't know it's funny to like go back and forth I enjoy these conversations because it's it's like challenging things and it's and i'm able to like exercise the stuff that I know, and you know can argue about I mean and I don't know like. It lets me get like a lot off my chest, you know that, like, I want to say to people and stuff like that you know how people are very misled. You know and it's funny because usually like atheists are agnostic people are usually the ones who go out and help people for and for no brownie points for some imaginary. Being in the sky, or they just do it for because they see a need, you know, and I think that's the whole point of like what. Jesus, or whatever you know the the authors were trying to get across was like don't do things, for you know, like do things out of kindness, because you see a need, you know not. With the the intention of in mind that, like your your treasures in heaven will be built in blah blah blah, you know that's not like that's not what God came for, and this glorifying God, like all this stuff it just it seems like indoctrination and. i've you know, and I have my past with the church where it, I wrote my negative, you know, like i've had trauma and stuff like that, but. You know it's just there's so many churches that like he wants me to subscribe to, like the the Republican Jesus, you know, the one that carries a gun in his all manga and blah blah blah, you know and i'm like. No, you know I mean he even went as far as trying to say that that Jesus would have been a capitalist and i'm like. No like there's a lot of examples where like you know, like Jesus fed the poor he didn't charge them either you know. You know, and like. He was for tax it, you know, like when they were talking about taxes, give on to Caesar what is caesar's you know and taxes, usually go to public social programs, you know that benefit all. You know what I mean. And it's just like I asked for some some examples you know, and I, you know I gave him quite a few clear examples that we're in the Bible, you know that he. I don't think he would have been Socialists or ever put like. They they're under this impression that we're in this communist takeover and it's like I remember even my dad like 30 years ago talking about. The commies taken over, and the slits like this theme that you know that the Republicans constantly you know that we're going to have this socialist take over because they're advocating for social programs. You know. But it's like so are you going to give up your social security, like you know mean like or the fire department or police services or because all of those are social programs they're paid for by the public. Their social programs we. nobody's advocating for for Communism or socialism or anything like that, but it's just like this huge fear mongering thing you know that i'm trying to get him past."
177.0,Provider,"You know yeah well you know it goes back to previous discussions we had about everyone being entitled to their opinions and their thoughts and you know as you were talking, I thought well people's impressions of religion is subjective right so even from the if everyone subscribed to. The Christianity. One person can read a Bible verse and, depending on what you're going through, they can interpret it in a different way, and someone else that has a different situation so. it's just interesting how, and I can see why politics and religion are things that you typically end up in conversations about. Because a lot of it is subjective right so you're from Republicans that Hillary indicated by their beliefs, because of certain value systems that they hold and the same holds true for democrats and independents you know. it's all based on our value system. All of us have different values and different. Our is a powerful how we how we, you know lean on moral compass from right. Are instilled by religion fire so. Nice change by our upbringing without parents i'm fine personal experiences that even in justices that experience."
1825.0,Patient,"And it goes back to core beliefs, a lot like a lot of those core beliefs like they aren't intentionally formed, but the experiences that we go through for those values like that those core beliefs and and values tie in very closely and they're not the same thing that they tie it very."
177.0,Provider,"Closely yeah because. there's a deficit and what you found the right. times those core things that you really. are eating or watching at the time when you don't have that. Thought distortions, maybe surrounded around that so, for example, you know. Someone that values connection right and anytime they interact with the social capacity, the thought distortion, maybe seeking now. Who is going to connect with me versus who won't so the thought distortion there's always these grouping that are extreme polar opposites as a way to measure our boundaries. You know if we're depressed, then you know we're constantly seeking out either times when we are feeling, you know depressed. And then we seek out those things to support differentiate yes i'm depressed yes i'm depressed so that depression becomes a core value of you versus a separate you know. it's a health diagnosis. does not have to really be."
1825.0,Patient,"yeah well i'm noticing a lot like within myself like. I don't know like I feel like I rebel against certainty, you know, like he is so certain in his beliefs or whatever, but i'm always the question or you know well, what about this, and what about you know, like. You know, like, I asked him, you know, like Okay, if things are so clear to you as far as more morality how about death is that a good thing or a bad thing. You know. Like I mean it's subjective. You know. You die in your belief, when you die you go to heaven, you know you get to go back to your creator so isn't that a good thing. You know what I mean. But you still like if you die, you know you have to leave your people, you know the people here behind stuff like that you know there's obviously good and bad you know and. From the the atheist perspective, you know it's the same thing, like someone dying or whatever someone may look at their carbon footprint or whatever and find positives in less. You know people, bringing it or if that person was bad or, in some way or like if there's prejudice against you know someone's death could be a good thing. You know what I mean like it's all subjective you know good and bad like and it's not everything isn't so certain you know and that's kind of what. What it like it's a blessing and a curse. You know because I can't feel certain about anything. And i'm always questioning everything so it's like. it's a good thing or a bad thing you know. Because it's good to have certainty. You know, and you know."
177.0,Provider,"Because of certainty. help. For right yeah exactly gives you that. gives you something to subscribe to, and then work towards that completion, whereas if there's questioning and every step of the play it hinders the process."
1825.0,Patient,"Right you don't know where to put your foot down on that first step in the journey because you're continuously questioning which which were like. Should I turn around should I go this way should I take that way, should I teach I get off the path should I you know it's like this constant uncertainty that leaves me in this like purgatory state, you know this. You know not moving forward, not moving back you know, but I feel like that's kind of a big like something that is a big problem that that affects a lot of different things in my life."
177.0,Provider,You know.
1825.0,Patient,"Like with the affiliate marketing the the dating you know going and traveling you know I sit there stuck in my head, what if what if what if what if what if I should I should I that should I you know and it's just it becomes debilitating you know almost crippling."
177.0,Provider,So how's it been for you this week.
1825.0,Patient,"I mean that's I think I think those are really built into my core belief, you know that constant questioning of everything and not having certainty. But actually this week I I reached out to Damien and. I know. um well, I was kind of looking to extend an olive branch right, you know, like so I I asked him like I sent him a text asking, are you building, you know and. He, I guess, he was at work or whatever it took a few hours to respond back, and you know we started talking a little bit about voting and he had task, as you know, because I knew which which marrow may may you. May or can may candidate, I was voting for him, but I wasn't certain on judges sheriff's and. You know, different things on the ballot or whatever, and you know, I understand that, like these are the the elections that that affect us. You know more directly. So I wanted to like I mean it was kind of a bs issue, but I do want to make an informed decision and I reached out to you know chose him to reach out to and like so it was like there was that, but that, like we chatted a little bit or whatever. And then you know kind of avoided the topic, but then you know I sent him a message saying hey look, you know, like we don't need to re litigate everything you know. I need to get better about communicating you know my wants and needs, you know, but you know and just kind of. Put it out there, you know, and he started taking responsibility for a lot of the stuff you know, he was like well it doesn't really help when I act like a crazy asshole and you know this, you know and so. I allowed the boundaries, to be you know, but like."
177.0,Provider,To me.
1825.0,Patient,"i'm just about the respect you know that you know and the communication, you know that you know i'm not going to put up with being put down. You know and he's been really careful you know and his jokes or whatever like kind of drives me nuts, because, like. You know, he we're both liberals, or whatever, and we bash on on Republicans, you know for gay jokes for Trans phobic you know stuff like that, but then, when he goes and brings up like a gauge, you know and it's just like it's really distasteful. You know. I I brought it up, because he continued doing it, or whatever, and I was like look dude the gay jokes kind of make me uncomfortable let's lighten up on it. And so. Little uncultured like there were things I was putting out, you know, while we were hanging out, you know, like setting boundaries."
177.0,Provider,So after. That text message exchange you guys.
1825.0,Patient,"yeah. It was like the next day or whatever, but um you know we ended up going and hanging out. You know I went over to go see here you're supposed to come over here because I was showing him my plants, and you know a few other things you know my crossbow and stuff like that, but he had just had a back surgery. And he couldn't sit for long periods of time, so he wanted me to go over there, so. I took a drive over there and we spoke to a little bit hung out and we talked a little bit you know, and you could tell that he. He really missed me, you know, he was pretty broken up about it, you know, and even more so than like I thought he'd be a little you know, but like I don't know he really revealed like his vulnerability and stuff like that. Well, you know he kind of mentioned, you know, like his depression suicidal thoughts and like just some of those thoughts that like. You know, nobody wants to be his friend, you know, like he's got a couple of light friends were like I do it, you know. Instances ever but, like, I think it be cut him pretty deeply and like when he was in that like suicidal state of mind like that was one of the things that played out in his head was that, like oh even Angelo doesn't want to be my friend, you know, and it was like. He was hurt you know and that really kind of it allowed me to take a few steps closer to like. To us, like more like instead of me now in here and him up here because. You know he's you know able to talk to grow or he's financially better or he's got this or that or trust, for you know, whatever you know it put us on a closer."
177.0,Provider,about me yeah.
1825.0,Patient,"So the status, I guess, and like also like. Like for me, I felt like like I was walking up those Apps for me that was to. allow him to treat me like like shit you know and to put me down and stuff like that you know and that's what really and like I walked up those steps, but Finally, for the first time I felt like he was like acknowledging me and seeing you know, like. It I you know, and it was he was being more respectful."
177.0,Provider,And there was certain things that he said that he feel like he was noticing your progress and see on wrap up with JEREMY.
1825.0,Patient,"um well like with the text messages instead like usually he'll throw. stupid gay jokes like he'll be like i'm coming over all over your face, you know or something yeah. Like very like vulgaris and it's like you can't say come or. Like anything with it like without it being something."
177.0,Provider,yeah and.
1825.0,Patient,"yeah and he more directed it out himself, instead, and I acknowledge like he was so that you could come over my face and it's like. Okay, you know but it's still like it's not directed at me. You know, and I mean. I think that he's got some. Some issues, whatever and maybe some tendencies at like i've felt like in the past, or whatever like. he's kind of like had some sort of like sexual attraction or whatever like he's he's straight, you know I mean he's never like you know come in here, but like there's been some times, where i've gotten those vibes like creepy vibes. You know, and I, you know I don't want to embarrass hand column that you know because I know how I would feel you know if that was me, you know but it's just like I don't know it makes me uncomfortable so you know, like. And I just I need to bring it up more you know and kind of call them out on it like how I bring it up, you know, like look dude we're always talking shit about you know Republicans, and the gay jokes and transfer, you know, like. We need to kind of clean that up instead of you need to click like we need to kind of get better about that. Because inappropriate. Like and when I was a kid like I grew up in a different era to and my dad was Republicans so it's like I feel like you know say whatever you want, as long as you want, you know. Showing House gets their feelings hurt that's their problem you know, and so I grew up hearing you know those FA you know. Those queers those you know this and that was very vulgar derogatory. terms, or whatever you know and it's just like it was very like. i'd become very. Like what's word of desensitized. To that, like. But now that i've kind of switched and like found like liberals, as my people and, like, I think, Liberals kind of take it too far to you know, like the the play politically correct, you know there's some stuff that like. You know there's a there's gotta be a happy medium. You know. And it's just sometimes the Liberals take it too far, so i'm sort of in the middle, or whatever, but there's certain things that it's just it's it's distasteful for this time, and I mean back in the 80s and 90s like times change. You know, culture, our culture evolves into being more accepting to minorities of society and that's The thing is, like religion is usually the one thing that drives you know this wedge between people this division all those people are sinners because men are supposed to lay with men. Like no God would love them just the same it like you know what love that don't try and change them we're all sinners you know your your sex out of wedlock is just as bad as two men like we're all the same. And it's just. A bothers me. People use religion to justify their hate."
177.0,Provider,"yeah. The justification of the thoughts that aren't in. place. Will you continue to progress and wanting to have impulsivity. And so we are mindful of those things. And I like how you're trying to page, you know damien's ability to also offer. me city, but it's going to be at. His own course right and remember everybody has a right to their opinion. And we have a right to not agree with it. puts you in that position of if he changes to want to continue to express you know disposition or use statements that other people would say is. You know it consider it and which word because. Some people love those type of like a mature jokes of like the play upon those type of words. yeah you know the trench phobia terms, some people do that because that's a part of their value system and they find it humorous and they don't think it's offensive anyway. So that was the unfortunate part of opinion opinions right because everyone has one."
1825.0,Patient,"But see like I don't know I think most people can kind of get like even when I like set it as an example, like, I saw your lip curl a little like you know. Like and I do that. You know, like she'll said, or whatever and i'll give them that look like you know. Oh. No he just he doesn't."
177.0,Provider,Okay. yeah.
1825.0,Patient,"Okay sorry. yeah he just doesn't pick up those verbal cues it's. it's weird you know, but I think I need to be more clear about it and and keep challenging him, you know when he does do it, you know. Like tell like and be more honest with you, I think I need to get more real like have more real talk with him, you know, instead of this light. You know flaky kind of like getting to the real you know into the weeds and the nitty gritty a look we're trying to improve each other's lives like this is inappropriate."
177.0,Provider,"curious, and so you told me this before, but I can't recall are useful childhood friends."
1825.0,Patient,"i've known him like I was like 1213 when I met him because he was dating my my older sister and, at the time, he was probably like 1819 something like that. And they did it like that was like that was my sister's love of her live forever and like we ended up still hanging out after they broke up. You know, and still remain friends. yeah."
177.0,Provider,"A lot of content, because what is the age difference between 217 year gap."
1825.0,Patient,Something like that yeah seven or eight years.
177.0,Provider,"yeah and then you guys met when you were young. Why that's important to think of and highlight is that you know when you have friendships that scar from a young age, and as you guys continue to grow and develop it's almost like friendships could be routed still in the course of the age of onset of the friends. Yes, yeah. Like trauma, you know, like when you if you your first traumatic experiences that three and you experience shame, you know, whenever you have experiences in your don't like that equate to shane it's like you go back to that three year old. So, not all friendships work in that way, but something to consider. right because of the age difference and because you guys have been friends for such a young age, and I only bring it up, because it seems like you've got some maturity just the type of job that he uses and even though you couldn't take accountability initially when you tried to."
1825.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know I I tried to like what I reached out to him, I really tried to keep in mind, you know. The dollar you, you know the stuff that you had brought up the you know that put him on the defensive and I tried to stay mindful of that you know, but not to a point where I retreated back behind where I gave up ground that I had already. gained you know. yeah and so like when I talked to him I kept in mind, you know, to try and not use the all or none statements and. stuff like that and. You know kind of like the stuff that he said, you know, like him, saying well Fuck you and you know, like it was on the defensive chopping it up to that. You know and. kind of we did kind of talk about the dynamics to how how things have changed, you know, like I used to look up to it, you know, like he introduced me to like a lot of music and stuff like that and I based a lot of my opinions off of what he liked. You know."
177.0,Provider,So that makes sense yeah.
1825.0,Patient,"And and see it's I think he felt kind of threatened that that gap was what's coming closer and closer together, as far as like the dynamics between us that. Like cuz he even brought up like you know because I was around my son or whatever, and I had said something about you know, like. Because he's always like concerned about me washing my hand but then the stripper thing, and you know he's always talking about doing putting his mouth and stuff on. Whatever but like. It was he had said something about like Oh, you were trying to act like you were better than me, you know and it's like How dare you be better than me, you know. you're supposed to like get back in your place below me, you know what I mean like."
177.0,Provider,directly at or is that something you interpret.
1825.0,Patient,It was something that the.
177.0,Provider,Actual data that.
1825.0,Patient,"You put it in in a text or whatever like he felt like he was insulted or whatever, because. We were like in his mind, we were laughing at him. Because of the the stripper thing, but it was just like a. push back on some of the insults that that he'd given me. You know. And he had said something along the lines of your your outer son and. You were trying to act like you were better than me by saying that I, you know eat out strippers or whatever like something along those lines, and I was like dude that was just me talking shit in response to you talking shit me putting me down in front of my kid. You know that i'm like this grimy filthy. You know that and. You know and we're right here in front of my kid. You know and it's like where's the logic, or whatever i'm dirty grimy filthy you know but you're not all that clean either you know. And it was just like that I don't know, it was very there was something about that that was very revealing to me like. He must keep like I must stay below it like it like a true friend would want to seek would want to lift me up and and and push you know make me your confidence and feel better about me, you know. You know, even if I have problems with shower you know with with hygiene or whatever don't come over and put me to you know say hey you work out that's part of depression or whatever just keep working for don't continue to like push me down. So that you feel better you know it's like that's how it felt and. It made me really uncomfortable to like when my stuff my son started coming around and stuff and like I thought that he would keep things sort of PG or whatever, but like it was even Andrew stop wanting to hang out with us because it's like it makes him oh comfortable. You know."
177.0,Provider,i'm noticing i'm feeling a little uncomfortable and I didn't even know all the details. yeah I can imagine it can repair those details about how awkward I would be it just goes back to maturity.
1825.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't know I just there's. i'm still kind of keeping a little bit of detail, like reserved, or whatever you know, because there are a lot of things that like I noticed about Damien that i'm not too crazy about you know and i'm not so. Like hypnotized or whatever by glamorized by oh he's that's Damien I don't know how to play ever even had it in my head that like. yeah yeah but."
177.0,Provider,i'm just concerned about the ability to maintain those healthy distances between the two because.
1825.0,Patient,You know so much has.
177.0,Provider,"changed from the last session a really, but you are in a place that you didn't want to reconsider. Now you have and there's nothing wrong with that what we enable to be super in and then no we don't like using or certain, but we have certain that we can maintain those healthy boundaries because based on what you shared with me, it seems that Damien will create repeat offender."
1825.0,Patient,Can chip away.
177.0,Provider,"And I don't think it's malicious But just think it's a part of some character. yeah he has to work through. And i'm not sure if he's at the place yet where he is identify that's, the first thing I need enough is identify those awesome in class."
1825.0,Patient,"Right yeah very much so, and that's that was one of the largest that was one of the biggest things that kept me away for so it was that, like his failure to acknowledge his partner, you know. That like he was just push it off on me, you know, or you, you know you're the you know you're the chunk you know i'm doing great i've got money i've got a career i've got to you know you're weird you stay with your mom and dad you know, like and it's just. Like i'm okay like i'm I live with my mom a lot of Dudes the turmoil like i'm not going to be shamed for it. You know i'm doing all right, you know and i'm certain about that, like and i'm not going to allow him. To start digging underneath that foundation that i've built, you know because that's what it feels like he's taken under that and jumping out, you know, like trying to crack that foundation that I built for myself, you know. and I don't know I just feel like a true friend wouldn't want to do that."
177.0,Provider,"To remain aware of what those boundaries are that you need to keep established within your friendships. And you know that may look like some distance when you feel that it's necessary. That you did you did say to him that you want to be better with communicating. You know your needs and the friendship so that's that's on your answer that's on your side of the street, to make sure that if you need to retreat, because you feel like your foundation is being compromised, then you should communicate that same."
1825.0,Patient,"yeah because a lot of the time, like the first thing in my head is like oh i'll just retreat quietly know like I need to communicate. And then put into action, get out of that fantasy realm of you know, all the same inspiration without action. started taking some action."
177.0,Provider,"yeah you have to treat silently. that's identifying as a bit. And when I say that's not such a big thumbs but it's to really put you into that that scope of your thinking, because when you retreat silently. You know your thoughts replayed over and over and all usually is he did this to me all of your investments is all of their fractions against you and it doesn't, allow me to get past it so that you can really commit to your tombstone. and prepare and recover from. Whatever the grievances."
1825.0,Patient,"It definitely yeah it takes confrontation, like, I have to confront it and and kind of leave the ball in his court look, you know, this is something that that makes me uncomfortable and i'm not willing to accept. yeah you know now it's up to you to either address it. or not."
177.0,Provider,"And the more you practice, the more freedom you're actually feel people tend to pay back boundaries are restrictions or What it does is it creates more space for you to really feel free to be you. And then also teach people how to create intentional connections with you to."
1825.0,Patient,"Those those boundaries end up being steps on the stairs of quite you know climbing you have to to build each step that you have you know each next step. yeah and each next step, not only do you have to maintain the you know the but you also have to add on to that. To you know to. To keep that momentum going upwards. Instead of. towing yeah."
177.0,Provider,"And and be mindful, as you continue on this journey of identifying boundaries of realizing Okay, which boundaries do I have the power to enforce to get the outcome, I want. Which boundaries require any making a request to someone else. so that I can get that."
1825.0,Patient,"I mean, also to I mean which battles are worth. I mean there has to be. That compromise as well."
177.0,Provider,"that's where you realize this is the boundary that I have my within my own power to create. Like you said when you mentioned out communicating i'm like listen this doesn't work for you anymore right that was you identifying what you have in your power to do, which is the power to do is communicate this makes me uncomfortable. So it's up to him if he's going to change his behavior so you no longer uncomfortable but then you have the power to decide Okay, because I make that change, and I have to remove myself from the situation. or whenever he brings up the topic. You do the curl it thing you do the discussion and you change the subject, maybe make you feel uncomfortable because, if someone say something to someone they know that okay this person is it really. right there yeah exactly."
1825.0,Patient,"yeah and I think. dress addressing it and, like if I like bring it up and have a good conversation, you know, like every time afterwards it'll be a reference back to that. conversation, you know, like you know and that's what it like it'll, be it can be cut like that reference can just be you know, like the nod and the current you know. yeah reference conversation, you know. So yeah I think that, like he has a really seemed like my bike. Or, yes, has a you know, but he just keeps pushing it and push continuing it, you know, but I think that it's something that has to be addressed and I tell you know talk to him, what do you like, and come to him, you know. kind of put somebody else's yet you know look we dog God Republicans for doing this. let's stop doing this."
177.0,Provider,"So that could be the entryway right he doesn't get defensive. If you notice that you are engaging that behavior. don't allow him. To point blame with you to. The word don't identify as that person neither so you can make you could just expressed a desire, you know well, you don't say you. Right you don't use the word view so it doesn't feel authentic to him, but it could be something along the lines to you know I really value conversations that aren't depository towards my mortgage. You know and bell taco statement because, with that it removes you from identifying as one of the people that that does that yeah and be careful to not over utilize the week because that's part of your people pleasing that wants to soften the blow right."
1825.0,Patient,"yeah and I think more than anything being. bowl and standing that like a lot of people like I challenge my own stuff in my own head before anyone else does. You know, so it it kind of. Like I end up backing it off when it doesn't need to be back yet. But I think that, like when he brings stuff up like it like just say dude that's not cool man like. We can't talk like we're trying to make you know we're trying to get rid of this behavior you know so let's. get rid of this behavior between us. And i'll do the same, you know i'll try i'll make an effort, not to bring up you know silly jokes like that either. And I mean if it slips where that you know, whenever, but like I. Think definitely bringing it up. I think that. I mean. Honestly, I think that I can appeal to his nature, because he said enough about it, you know we're like he feels strongly against it, you know and just point out. That it's wrong like I kind of seen it see him accepting it, you know."
177.0,Provider,You you've been friends with him long enough to have a gauge about. would be willing to do. something about the heart.
1825.0,Patient,Well he's brought it up enough time like in called others out on it before that he acknowledges that it's. it's inappropriate. yeah.
177.0,Provider,That indicated that he wants to change we just hope that he's not hyper critical right because in this culture of being woke people like to call out other individuals about micro aggressions and the things that they do. But then they they lack of self awareness. At all so.
1825.0,Patient,"yeah it. becomes a tit for tat and I think it's best to like i'm going to try and avoid that by like including myself into like the part of you know, like and i'm going to make an effort, because I know that. I slip on it too. You know yeah just I think that it's gonna take a while, because I think it's just so ingrained in. You know, but. he's gonna have to practice, you know it's gonna have to be some work there's plenty of stuff i'm working on, you know, I think that."
177.0,Provider,"Will you know what I think was promising is that he will be in a safe environment me your relationship your friendship that he can work through his his imperfections. Here that's what's most important and just remind them of it seems that you know you're willing. Even despite the differences that you are have you still willing to engage in this friendship, I just want you to be very aware of when that engagement and wanting to create a safe environment impedes on your ability to be safe."
1825.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and i'm definitely have to be mindful like because there's been some stuff where i've felt uncomfortable you know, like. You know even since we've hung out again, and one of the main things is the you know the gay jokes and stuff you know and like it's not just like. I mean, I say inappropriate jokes silly stupid jokes or whatever, but like. The stuff that like he said it's like very visual like. I don't know it's just very derogatory and I don't know. It crosses a boundary."
177.0,Provider,That yeah.
1825.0,Patient,"More than just like it's it, it makes it personal about me in it, because, like even when we hang out like he's taken me to to. A whole carly enter which are these. Natural springs that you know you soak in or whatever, and like we go to the bar and we're sitting there, whatever and we you know he's like dude I hope they don't think we're you know the gay Dudes and we were a couple you know. So there's that weird dynamic or whatever like. And i've even felt it too, or you know, like. And there's a couple of times right order drink or whatever, like a mixed drink and it comes in, like a wide and it's like a food, drink or whatever and he's got a beer, you know so he's like well at least you the chicken. Religions enough. But we both know that there's never been any sort of like. I mean there's been that weird uncomfortable like but there's never been any sort of like interaction like that, but there's still that like God I get you know guys are probably you know, most people here, probably think we're we're a couple of gay Dudes you know. And it's like. hey that's all right, they can think, whatever the hell, they were you know, like."
177.0,Provider,"That example that makes me think it gets me curious. When he makes these comments, it could be a bit of projection too because maybe there's an insecurity or fear that other people view you in that light and you haven't verbalized it, but he is. So it can be confusing on his and I will try to see both perspectives if in some occasions you guys can joke about it and then another occasion it's like oh my gosh you're being very gross right so. There will be up for you to determine. When does When does it cross around laughing when does it become and like really may say you know when you become descriptive. What will you do this that's when it becomes over the top, when we make you know those jokes here and there, and give those examples that's okay right but determine for yourself what that is because it's not up for him to determine what your brand."
1825.0,Patient,"i'm okay with yeah. yeah yeah cuz I think he can kind of notice to like when i'm oh cuz I immediately like just he'll say a one of these stupid comments or and i'll just continue talking or whatever. Like I don't like. As if he didn't even say anything you know, like, I give the you know but that's not enough, you know to like. inspire some sort of chat like it's not setting that boundary. And I mean I need to set that boundary in stone, you know. Instead of just it's like i'm kind of throwing it missing, you know."
177.0,Provider,"yeah. i'm sure that you'll get to a place where you could figure out what works for you what doesn't and if it's okay things change, maybe today you're okay with those jokes at the bar and then some big changes for you in. That way."
1825.0,Patient,"But like. he'll he'll take it as far as like where there's that uncomfortable but, like the the winner i'll come over and over and like he'll go and put his hand on my knee or something you know, like and it's like like. it's already like we're hoping people aren't like don't push that."
177.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
1825.0,Patient,it's just.
177.0,Provider,"Like a very firm boundary is. You know, it makes me uncomfortable when it's us to especially makes me uncomfortable when we try to engage and involve people in it yeah i'm not comfortable and you know you can offer reasons why you're uncomfortable or not, it could just be It makes me uncomfortable period. But if you feel like you want to be generous, I can give you some examples. You can really understand that you know that i'm comfortable too, and I think for anybody if you guys have that venture on and off. that's a very like. it's a very delicate balance because someone on the wrong day. That can just be misinterpreted or just."
1825.0,Patient,"yeah here and not only that, but I mean like we are supposed to be. Like everything about that behavior. it's it's immature and it's it's that like childhood bullying like playground kind of material, you know, like gay, is no longer and negative. Content being or whatever. You know I remember as a kid you know that's gay oh this. You know that's not like we're we're except."
177.0,Provider,"it's like the inferences let's get negative attention. hear me. audio cut out, can you hear me oh."
1825.0,Patient,"No, I was gonna come at him with a, by the way, that the 80s called and they want their jokes back."
177.0,Provider,"yeah. Interesting interaction. can see that there's definitely benefits and high validity of friendship and then there's areas where you know which puts all going to work so. i'm always here as a resource to give you options on ways that you can verbalize those boundaries because that's something that I can just going to be very significant for this friendship to. be a healthy one. have to implement those boundaries. Well, I have you on my schedule for next week, St. Next week, same time."
