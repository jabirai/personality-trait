16059.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
79.0,Provider,Good are you in a study room.
16059.0,Patient,I am good.
79.0,Provider,"Work, mind you find good places you make it work it's really impressive. that's awesome so we have treatment team meeting this morning and Kelly, and I, we talked with. Dr Anderson and anyway, so we I feel like we kind of have lots to talk about. But at the same time it's not like. It also won't take that long um but anything top of your mind."
16059.0,Patient,mm hmm. know just really what I think you are wanting to discuss that's all.
79.0,Provider,"Okay alright sounds good, so let yeah let's just talk about you know what Dr Anderson. I am. And I haven't met yet with your mom. I think that that might be helpful to do because i'm wondering if she feels like you're struggling or that your health is more endanger than it is. And you can correct me if i'm wrong because you're in the body, you know what it feels like."
16059.0,Patient,and
79.0,Provider,"You know, but when I talked with Dr Anderson you know she said, you know mom's worried and thinking we should try and do a Inpatient. You know, some kind of residential treatment. And when I asked her what do you think medically wise. You know she was like you know she's pretty stable still you know that you don't have to I guess is what the doctor saying you don't have to go. But, but also, I don't know what it feels like in your body. you're doing amazing things with your food yes there's some times that you're struggling we we can expect you to be perfect hundred percent."
16059.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,"But like was it that chocolate hot chocolate and Croissant this week. hello, you did it. yeah I mean i'm not saying it's not hard for you. But really you're doing, really, really good work carefully feels like you're really diving in you're being honest you're starting to get angry, which is happy. I told I told them in treatment team meeting I want a group session, where you guys practice wearing. copy. But I mean tell me what you think are you feeling like I am hanging on by my fingertips, and I feel like i'm going to going to crash or i'm gonna crack or you know you're the one doing the really hard work."
16059.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's definitely really difficult but I don't know because my mom said that she was feeling more comfortable with me staying. Just with this and then at my medical appointment on Wednesday. with Dr Anderson. I had apparently lost a few pounds and then she said that she would recommend a higher level of care so that was my.
79.0,Provider,"impression yeah. And she was actually contacted yeah she contacted us, and so we, I think we helped to give her some perspective on that. Just because weight drops a few pounds. Sometimes we just give too much weight to wait."
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"You know if you were going to analyze my weight week to week I have no idea what you would find. You know, but you might find that one week it drops a few pounds. And then other times it's stable and then other times it goes up like weight shifts and we don't overanalyze except for like in these cases."
16059.0,Patient,Man yeah.
79.0,Provider,"Honestly, do you feel like you ate pretty well over the thanksgiving break."
16059.0,Patient,"I feel like I lay too much so, probably it."
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm so to me your body's not in danger because you weren't eating enough does that make sense. And she said, your heart rate wasn't very concerning you know, there was a when you do the sit down to stand up, that there was a bit of an elevation but not enough to really worry about it's not good enough to where we want you to exercise yet, but it's still stable enough for I O p. And she didn't have any other concerns. You know, I think. The reason that she brought it up is because your mom has been concerned and maybe this is from weeks past and we also have that contract that was created for the fit. mm hmm but we're not going by that contract. yeah right and outpatient, we have to have a little more leeway you're on your own Maya like. yeah. We can have such hard lining and unless medical says no like this, this person's health is at risk right at this minute. And from what Dr Anderson said it's not you, you can we kind of feel like you can keep doing the good work, and we do want you to step it up and get angry and because you want the anger to go out not alone in."
16059.0,Patient,and
79.0,Provider,"But that's that's kelly's work that's where the therapy work. So. Anyhow, but I mean what do you think, do you think you can keep going, I mean you're gonna be home for Christmas here soon."
16059.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's definitely been very hard. And i'm just feeling very stuck. To like I haven't made much progress so. I feel like it's kind of like a toss up.
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and you get you get the final say. I want to make that clear that if you're like. Look guys i'm exhausted, I feel stuck but also sometimes it's like Have you ever done river rafting."
16059.0,Patient,No.
79.0,Provider,"Okay i'm trying to think of another analogy. Well, maybe you can visualize it but. Sometimes you know you're going along and in the rapids and stuff and sometimes you kind of get stuck in a little. eddie or a little. Like you know rock place but then you push enough and push enough and get the angle of the boat just right and you launch so you can be stuck just momentarily. Even though feels like crap i'm gonna drown no but one little thing like maybe even just you like really letting your anger out like seriously letting it out, would be the thing that makes you. Have a little bit of relief, because you know, when I look at your thought records, I mean it is clear the guilt and the shame, we have to work on that. and it's just because you a lot of times you know what to do. Sometimes you know that you question and you're like i'm not sure what to play it up. But a lot of times you do you know what to do, you follow through it's just that heaped on during and afterwards the guilt and the shame and if we can have you get some air there. I wonder if that would be the unstuck that would help."
16059.0,Patient,I don't know yeah.
79.0,Provider,"But at the same time, going into residential is not it's not like oh this didn't work it's just I think this is what I need right now. Because the thing about residential is you, you go back to outpatient at some point. You have to do this again. kind of a thing, where it's going to be hard again you're not going to have all those supports. Here either way I would I would support either way. But just so you know from my perspective, we think you're okay to keep going and I op. Okay, what does that feel like to hear that, though."
16059.0,Patient,"Her to hear i'm okay to do it so. yeah um I mean it's good it's just like I was a little surprised, because when I want it to the appointment, she was like. I think you need a higher level of care and then to hear that I like I don't know it's just confusing because it feels like a lot of back and forth, sometimes with different people saying different things."
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah and I agree, and I think that's why treatment team, you know matters. And and different people like your your mom and Dr Anderson communicate more you know. So she might be getting some of that pressure from your mom. yeah, but what we want to do is have a meeting with you and your mom and Kelly, and I and kind of outline you know these are the expectations. And you know one week of having dropped a few pounds isn't browns enough to go oh. You need high level okay there's more to it than that. Because body weight does that sometimes you see continued downward trend. And you're eating really lacks well then yeah that's not safe. You know kind of."
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"But how was your you know your experience, are you feeling dizzy are you feeling super tired anything that. Your body is lacking and."
16059.0,Patient,I am feeling dizzy at times and then definitely like a lower energy at times again. And then also i'm having such a hard time sleeping. and So that's definitely not helping. The lack of n.
79.0,Provider,Tell me about the sleeping.
16059.0,Patient,"I just haven't been able to fall asleep lately no idea why. not getting like much continuously, like all habit that's. Very disruptive. So yeah."
79.0,Provider,What what medications or any supplements or medications that you've tried.
16059.0,Patient,"i'm Dr Anderson recommended maybe using my anxiety medicine one night to see if that would help i'm going to use it last night and it didn't really help and normally. That knocks me out for a long time, so I was surprised that it didn't help really but yeah i'm not sure because it's also like finals coming up soon. Okay, I don't want to like."
79.0,Provider,yeah you want to be ready for that.
16059.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,"Plus your stress might be a little bit higher. yeah a lot of times when since Kelly says you're doing really good therapeutic work bringing all that up to the surface, can be. kind of put you in a little more a fight or flight, so you just might be a little bit more elevated in that. I mean you could try, you know just some basic supplements to help, but I really think this is more of a therapeutic thing that we're doing."
16059.0,Patient,That would make sense mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,Just because when you sleep what happens to your brain.
16059.0,Patient,Just. Just like relaxes.
79.0,Provider,"Your your guards go down. yeah right. And if they're not part of that fight or flight is awaken because of the really good therapy work then it's the two battling each other right. yeah I wonder if Dr started going have you met him. So he's a doctor that does some consultations with iot Program. I mentioned, Dr Kelly that maybe you should meet with Dr sort of wine and see about anything because he can prescribe minutes. Okay anything to help. Okay yeah. Because yeah you need to sleep, and I would bet the tire. Is from that."
16059.0,Patient,"Honestly, so I think."
79.0,Provider,"yeah it can even make you dizzy to. Who, and that we We need your sleep mean the melatonin you can try the. b vitamins I don't know if you've ever tried that her sleep sometimes that's helpful. And you don't take it at night just take it, you know, during the day, or like asleep et. know. there's even sometimes people like when I was going to a stressful time I use just the essential oil lavender. came to help me calm."
16059.0,Patient,Okay.
79.0,Provider,"You know, and just rubbing it like on the pulse points and by the ears, I would even do this year massage with oil and look you have any lavender oil. But you're doing a year massage and just when. You start at the top and drape down and just go back. pain know, maybe about 10 times. mm hmm i'm sure I haven't had professional massages done up but i'm sure that's probably part of it."
16059.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, let me email Dr short of lane and Kelly on that just see. And then you know, last time we did meal examples we got kind of more specific was that helpful me it's been two weeks so."
16059.0,Patient,"it's it's been okay like it definitely has been helpful. To reference, I guess, but it's just like it's hard to be able to do that, like to really get all this stuff together and make sure that everything's there."
79.0,Provider,"In the moment to. yeah you are you i'm serious when I say you're doing a Herculean effort. Like you're doing something that's really, really hard. No. that's really it's impressive. um. I don't know I mean there's a couple you know directions, I want to go, but what do you think. What should we focus on what could help there's something to recovery record, we could put like laying out the next week's days trying to guess you know what what you'd have tomorrow and. Sunday and stuff or. Do you think would be best helpful for us to do now."
16059.0,Patient,"I don't really know what sure Okay, do you have any ideas, maybe where to start."
79.0,Provider,"I mean, we might as well you know throw some foods into recovery record. So that you kind of go well, this was the plan and it's okay. That i'm not doing this exact plan just pulling it up here. Because we haven't put that into recovery record where we put the exact things. mm hmm, and so I think we should just try it we haven't tried it yet. Why not saying that helps I really think the key piece, though, is that guilt and shame of eating it of worrying about what people think. know all of that, and from what Kelly says it's got so much to do. With how you needed to protect yourself in your growing up."
16059.0,Patient,Right.
79.0,Provider,"It was a. Protection Mechanism. And to be hyper aware that way. yeah so. Oh, before I forget let's talk about this before we put these meals in the mindfulness exercise did it make eating worse."
16059.0,Patient,Oh yeah it kind of felt like it yeah.
79.0,Provider,"And that's not. that's actually pretty typical for somebody. who's having to do a pretty. Structured meal plan that has some focus on weight and things. like that. yeah makes sense. Okay, so no mindful eating for you."
16059.0,Patient,"let's just not do that for a while, even though that's the assignment."
79.0,Provider,"If you happen to feel like it and it's just a lighter situation you're not feeling as guilty then be like super light mindful eating like Oh, I think I think I like how this is crunchy or I think I like that this has a sweet and salty or. Oh, and this does need a little more salt. i'm going to post more salt that's mindful eating."
16059.0,Patient,You know okay.
79.0,Provider,"yeah, yes, but just keep it very light and not too much we don't want to go analytical with you, with what you're having to do. I think you're right on to not do that. And i'll be in all teach nutrition group next week, so I can help you like, no mines got a little different situation."
16059.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have Do you still have snapped to do today."
16059.0,Patient,Yes.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's plan that so today's Friday so i'm putting it right into the recovery record. Okay, good afternoon snack what are you thinking, what do you have plan."
16059.0,Patient,um well I am at the library right now. And so that when this appointment is it'll like be my snack time so I brought. An apple and a kind bar with me that.
79.0,Provider,"Okay perfect alright so i'll put that in. My notes down on my computer sometimes. Things just don't work as good. Okay, on here. And I figured it out okay dinner what's."
16059.0,Patient,For dinner dinner i'm not sure yet maybe like a rap from the dialing.
79.0,Provider,What else.
16059.0,Patient,"Some sort of fruits. With it, that they had so depending on what they have there at the dining hall."
79.0,Provider,mm hmm okay. And then something else. You need your second side.

79.0,Provider,"Is yoga stack you would have with them, or would they have snacks you could eat with them."
16059.0,Patient,They might. I mean I I would eat yogurt with them. Like able to snack on whatever they have really cool.

16059.0,Patient,"I don't have any names, but I do have like I have an apple but that's."
79.0,Provider,Hard yeah that's crunchy I mean unless you let the grape NUTS soak in the yogurt then it's not so hard. I just think gosh that's a lot of chewing.
16059.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
79.0,Provider,"let's put another option there because, maybe, as you think about it, dried cherries or. Gemini juices or anything."
16059.0,Patient,Now I don't have any of those either.
79.0,Provider,"The dining Hall, you said is closed."
16059.0,Patient,On Saturday morning. And Sunday morning.

79.0,Provider,And then tomorrow dinner.
16059.0,Patient,For dinner not sure what that's going to be as we were talking about maybe pushing going out to dinner tomorrow night instead. yeah so that's kind of like up in the air.
79.0,Provider,"So I was put on here going out to dinner. Remember main. And to side. And aside can be in drink like I would love for you, it was last time you had a soda like spider coker."
16059.0,Patient,yeah I don't even know.
79.0,Provider,That would be so awesome. Just how like I don't know where would you guys go out pizza burgers.
16059.0,Patient,"goes your problem, or like a burger type. place and that thing."
79.0,Provider,"yeah So if you did a burger and Fries or honestly if you're like oh my gosh I can't do burger Fries and a soda clean that's too much, maybe you did burger salad and coke or. Sprite or whatever it is that you like. Okay that'd be awesome. Okay, and snack after that."
16059.0,Patient,"That could be like an apple and a. Protein or you know, Mr."
79.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, something simple, especially after that you're going to be honest. Okay Sunday."
16059.0,Patient,"Sunday that's tricky because the dining concept closed, but my friends and I were thinking about going. Oh wait no that's next week and they're coming maybe. I could go get a smoothie like a movie ball actually."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and I see. This movie um, can you tell what's in this movie and get make it a full meal. Or do you feel like you probably should do a granola bar."
16059.0,Patient,"yeah so no it depends if. there's one place, that you can not, but there is one place that. I could, but I also sometimes like getting some people instead, so it will be like. Like the base and then I have like granola and stuff with it so."
79.0,Provider,"I love that. Yes, really or smoothie ball. And then. They have like well if you get this movie bull and it's like solid enough meaning it's got enough carbs and you may not need aside but i'll just put on here and bread item. Right. Maybe not like little muffins or something. Okay morning snack Sunday."
16059.0,Patient,"Okay, that can just be. me again like a protein bar sort of thing. something out of it."
79.0,Provider,"Put the fruit. You know, maybe the oranges are starting to get really good you know, maybe an orange."
16059.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,wintertime citrus so good. Okay lunch Sunday.
16059.0,Patient,"and on Sunday can be. Maybe like. I think so. i'm probably dining hall open. Right any holes are open at that time yeah. Yes, I could do that but i'm probably going to be at the library. Around then, and they have a starbucks in the library."
79.0,Provider,"Oh Nice. So, like a bagel or something."
16059.0,Patient,yeah maybe.
79.0,Provider,"i'll put starbucks meal. So, what are your options bagel or. To do that, like. it's almost like a rap. yeah but he has dropped like."
16059.0,Patient,"Those. And then they have like a good fight thing, I think. i've never had food from starbucks before I like i've had me like besides like a Croissant and. yeah like hot chocolate thing but."
79.0,Provider,"So just make sure that you know. I can't spell chocolate let's go. Okay got it okay so just remembered you know. You need the three parts, you need the carb you need the protein and then another side at starbucks I don't expect you to eat fruit, you know, so the hot chocolate could be it, but like bagel or rap. And then, like breakfast bites I would say, if you have the bagel and the hot chocolate and you have something on the bagel. Whether it's cream cheese, I like a little sandwich and then you don't need to do the breakfast bites just the big one, not chocolate time. But like if you just had hot chocolate and breakfast bites not enough right the breakfast bites are basically just a it's just your protein, so you need a carb. So, like doing around. or something like that. Maybe a good way to do that is, I think I know i'll go plus. So the rap plus. breakfast bites or something, although. Actually disagree with that. It would be more if you got like. A muffin."
16059.0,Patient,Okay.
79.0,Provider,"it's almost yeah anyway we've talked about enough, and you probably get it okay afternoon snack."
16059.0,Patient,It means probably like another kind of grabbing those type thing so.
79.0,Provider,Do you ever do like cheese sticks or something.
16059.0,Patient,yeah actually sticks.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, maybe to stick and fruit."
16059.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
79.0,Provider,dinner on Sunday.
16059.0,Patient,In the dining hall so like. rap or. Maybe going to the Buffet.
79.0,Provider,mm hmm. OK. So i'll just put dining hall. chicken or other protein rice or other car salad or other vegetable or fruit. And then evening SEC need more treats on here not nearly enough treats. dessert every day. But. What do you think for evening snack.
16059.0,Patient,"I was thinking, maybe like a yogurt or something like that."
79.0,Provider,"yeah that sounds good. I just put yogurt and bar. OK, the next day, you have to put in like a like a solid desert Monday somewhere in there, Monday breakfast."
16059.0,Patient,Monday breakfast will probably be like eggs in something from the dining hall.
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm. i'm going to put on here dairy you know. make you their milk or a little cheese on your eggs, you know. Okay morning stack."
16059.0,Patient,"And again, probably some sort of like. grabbing go type thing so. Maybe like fruit bar."
79.0,Provider,munch.
16059.0,Patient,munch will probably be something from the dining hall or my REPS maybe actually like a sandwich in my room I can.

More congruent with yourself and. more able to do that sort of thing again. I don't know what do you think about that could you pick up Panda express again."
