706.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I suppose it's a lot cheaper than buying them."
12799.0,Patient,"Oh, it is it's I don't even spend $100 a month on my cigarettes, when I think about what I used to spend you know it's like I like to smoke no there's just no getting around it, I like smoke cigarettes and. Well, the way to do it."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and you're working on your you know."

12799.0,Patient,"It a lot of people that are trying to quit smoking they'll put them on well you turn. yeah so i'm just kind of thinking, if, if I can cut down all the better, you know. Absolutely."
706.0,Provider,"that's harm reduction, you know, having. Five is better than having 15 you know what I mean so. good for you good for you and the thing is like I said, you know one thing at a time you're working on your opioid use disorder you don't need to be trying to quit smoking at the same time I just it's. Not."
12799.0,Patient,going to work well oh boy. I think that that would just throw me into some kind of it says that.
706.0,Provider,"you'd be completely stressed out. Completely stressed out, you know people when they quit smoking they eat constantly because. He says."
12799.0,Patient,It replaces like crazy.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so it replaces the smoking and so you know you we typically replace one with the other until you get to a good place where you can stabilize it so yeah so um so you're getting ready to go for the holidays, how you feeling about it."
12799.0,Patient,"You know I mean i'm going to be over there for quite a stretch but. You know, and my mom really wears me out sometimes. so nice it just really just takes a lot out of me to be over there at her house, you know."
706.0,Provider,What do you mean she. wears you out.
12799.0,Patient,"he's very difficult sometimes she she just she just can't help herself, you know it's like you know if you're not doing your her way it's not the right way. Okay she's like she's so good at like you know, like when I was over there for thanksgiving I was stirring the noodles too fast."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, I didn't know that there was that. or noodles."
12799.0,Patient,"shit like that and she's constantly just ragging you know just constantly it's like you just can't do anything right, you know and it's like I really don't think that she means it personally I just think that she can't she just can't help herself yeah."
706.0,Provider,Have you ever said anything to her.
12799.0,Patient,um yeah.
706.0,Provider,And how did that go.
12799.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i'll stand my ground, you know, sometimes when it when you know, like things like the noodles I can just let that go yeah you know when when i'm doing something that you know. isn't isn't wrong at all, you know, like like you know when she's talking to me and I, and you know we're having a conversation but she'll say something and I don't necessarily have a response. You know i'm just like it and she'll she'll get all pissed off, you know people do people usually respond when somebody's talking to them like what. You know and and okay look. You know that's that you know i've had about enough I don't need to. Sound looking for bite and i'm not gonna bite you, you know and."
706.0,Provider,yep. So this is.
12799.0,Patient,"What yeah, so this is why."
706.0,Provider,"And so, adult children do. not live with their parents. Because those. happen so. A couple of things."
12799.0,Patient,"Why he kept doing it on thanksgiving I you know, I was, I was standing my ground and she does she ended up you know just just walking out the door and go under, going to the neighbors her friends for a little good and then she came back. And everything was different."
706.0,Provider,You know yeah. So around is.
12799.0,Patient,"Okay, every little thing."
706.0,Provider,"But yeah. So standing your ground is OK, but it's. it's."
12799.0,Patient,"gonna take me to the methadone clinic tomorrow. You know I mean she's good about that and, like the last time on thanksgiving the day after he took me in there was like a huge line it was like 45 minutes, they really bought the. methadone clinic the day after thanksgiving but hopefully they don't do that again for Christmas and they said they're ready, but they had a nurse just quit this week so who knows."
706.0,Provider,yeah those things happen it. doesn't know that he's gonna he's still going to take me in.
12799.0,Patient,"You know if it's that bad, you know how i'm gonna keep just targeting go home and then i'll just catch the bus closer to her house and she can pick me up there, but you know and then i've got some you know any events happening. yeah sorry hang on this week and that I want to be a part of and so she's she's been really gracious about that you know understanding that I want to do that stuff. she's. You know, like like. Friday. they're doing a hope for the holidays thing and it starts on Friday and they'd be like a marathon meeting all night long and all day Christmas and and they're doing a dinner on Friday or thing, and so I want to do the dinner on Friday and my home. is doing a marathon meeting at five, and so I want to be there for that and she's gonna she's gonna take me down and drop me off for that and then pick me up a minute or two, if I can get a ride back. And then, on Saturday i'm an na hall is is all day they're doing a an all day things for the homeless there's going to be a spread of you know just food and meetings and stuff bell or. You know and and I was seeing how I was homeless for so long in this area, you know if anybody homeless drips in that I knew, you know, maybe they'll see me and maybe it'll inspire them a little bit I don't know. But no going over there and we're making. The cookies that we that my family does or here it's just peanut butter in between two roads different budge but. We know it's just been a family thing for a long time in the. Victim my mom and I have done it and so we're going to go over there today she's going to pick me up not too long after our appointment and i'm and i'm going to be making those today and."
706.0,Provider,I really made me hungry.
12799.0,Patient,"loan she bought some disposable trades. And i'm going to. bring some probably you know, to the hope for the holidays and then to the thing on on Saturday."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
12799.0,Patient,So that was nice of her to think of because we're not going to eat them all diabetic and i'm like I don't you.
706.0,Provider,"Know they're sitting in front of me I might eat them all you're making me hungry. salivating i'm like a Christmas goodies are so good, and I usually every year. And I haven't made them."
12799.0,Patient,"You know, bought him that we're going to quote. him. And the cream potatoes that she makes but you know if i'm going into it with a positive mind and. You know, hopefully it goes well, hopefully there's no. huh no. No let's."
706.0,Provider,process a little bit because you said kind of a lot so let's process a little bit so remember in group we talked about where you were a year ago at Christmas.
12799.0,Patient,Yes.
706.0,Provider,"Compared to where you are now so that in itself is something to celebrate. You know that in itself is something to celebrate that in itself is something to be proud of. That in itself is. something you know. The last you know, have allowed recovery like be proud of, where you are."
12799.0,Patient,So you know.
706.0,Provider,"But you know from the streets. You know, tell them like yeah you know I am doing better I am you know, like you can do it, too, you know, whatever whatever it is that you're feeling, do you know and and it's okay. Take your recovery loud I think it's really important. that nobody ever teams themselves down when it comes to recovery because it's so hard. yeah other thing process."
12799.0,Patient,Is your mom.
706.0,Provider,"Oh moms or moms and they've been that way forever and they're probably never going to change. You look at their circles of control the things you can change the things that you have no power over and the things that nobody has power over and. You can only have power over how you react. So, if your mom is getting under your skin, you have every right to say, for instance string does like ma'am I know that you stir the noodles at a higher speed or lower speed, but. Is my stirring the noodles at this speed. When to. And just and just she says, and you know if it becomes like a power struggle with her."
12799.0,Patient,Then just be like.
706.0,Provider,"I need to step away for a minute. Because that's what you do, you need to step away and do some mindfulness do some deep breathing some. visualization you know just get yourself centered again so you're in a better place, because it can be really frustrating with somebody like doing that right you're not doing that right you're like can I do anything right. You know, and so you need to just step away and just Center yourself deep breathing visualization mindfulness be grateful for where you are now. So things aren't perfect, but they are so much better than they were a year ago and that's what you need to focus on is all those really positive things. The fact that you're there with your mom in itself is a really positive thing, because you, you had said when we first started. therapy that you and your mom had a very strained relationship and then you know she was really there for you, when you got your teeth pulled and you guys have definitely started to rebuild that relationship. So focus on that strength perspective of that is going well, all of these other little things. Those are things that can be worked on, you know but don't just keep them inside and then below definitely be like you know I understand you do it like this, but if I do it like this, is it going to ruin it. Because just because people it's like math so you know how they like old school math it's like you know, like normal people math I call it. And now, they have the new school math that they put things in a box and like weird things to like teach kids multiplication and division and I have no idea how to do it, so when my little guy goes to school, I have to hire him a tutor because I have no clue. And it doesn't make any sense to me because I like the old school math. But then the new school math is different. And the thing is is both ways get the same answer it doesn't matter how you do it. I know there wasn't it's the same result oh yes it's ridiculous. Like multiplication and division, they do these like this, like weird I don't even know how to explain it i'm just like this makes no sense to me, but this is how they're teaching our children math. wow so anyways it's definitely not how I learned math but um. But the thing is is both ways you get the same answer."
12799.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know, and so it's like does it really matter which way you do it. In the end. it's the same and so that's kind of the same thing with your mom she saying oh you're not doing this right, but you can be like mom in the end we're going to have the same results like these noodles are still going to be done and edible. Whether I stir it. You know at 30 miles an hour."
12799.0,Patient,"or five miles an hour, you know."
706.0,Provider,"It doesn't matter you know there's still going to be. you're still going to be the same. And so, expressing that to her and then also being like you know mom when you are really critical with me it, you know it hurts my heart and makes me feel bad It makes me doubt myself and i'm really."
12799.0,Patient,"Her I told her stuff like that I tell her you know you're so critical of me and and that hurts me, you know because I just feel like i'm not good enough and I am good enough, you know I tell her I am good."
706.0,Provider,"yeah i'm working on that self esteem, so they feel like you're good enough."
12799.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,And when did she say.
12799.0,Patient,she's nothing see this gets pissed off it goes on to something else it will start ragging on Ted or you know he just.
706.0,Provider,hey at least it's not you are.
12799.0,Patient,"going through chemo right now, and he doesn't need her on."
706.0,Provider,The other things. Are mom might have. An address to mental health stuff or. Things that are. going on with her.
12799.0,Patient,I know she does too.
706.0,Provider,"And the way that she copes is she had she leaves you alone cuz you're like okay I I you know enough and move on. You know and and and I understand that and that's but that's her so you have to then decide okay. This is my mom this is how she is. yeah I can react to that. My mom isn't probably going to change, so how long can I be around her and be healthy, I think what's going to be your saving grace, as you have all these activities planned so you're going to be got a lot of the time."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I yeah and and then, then my my worry, because then my depression sets in and i'll change my mind is the last thing i'll be like I don't want to go."
706.0,Provider,"No, no, no, no, no, no, so you know. You add a piece of paper. and write yourself a note. yeah he says, I must attend all activities."
12799.0,Patient,yeah well and i'm trying that's why that's why doing the cookies. And and wanting to bring them and and stuff and i've already you know my my sister's poncy. Her you know i've already kind of committed to her that I was either for the dinner.
706.0,Provider,"Accountability accountability telling somebody. was like when you started dying, you want to tell somebody because you'll be more successful."
12799.0,Patient,Right that's why I don't tell people when i'm trying to win i'm going to quit smoking. But you know I usually am going to fail at that.
706.0,Provider,"Well yeah you know and and that's the thing so when you really commit to something you tell people you know you're loud about whatever you're recovering from so. The thing for you that's going to be your saving grace is going to those events, I think probably from what you've told me with your mom I know you love your mom and I i'm sure that she loves you. But moms and daughters have this unique relationship of if they're around each other too long. Especially if there are a lot of like us."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah and we are a lot of like to. yeah I also have a couple of church things that i'm going to be getting into online so i'll be able to put my ear buds in and kind of you know check. Out with that, but i'll still be present. For her to talk to me if she wants that."
706.0,Provider,"Number there is nothing wrong with taking a break walking away and doing some mindfulness and getting centered there's nothing wrong with that. yeah there is nothing wrong with doing that, if you need to take some space take some space and simply say that. Like mom I understand, but I need to take some space and then just go take your space, by the time you come back she's going to be on to something else or somebody else from what you said so. um and there's nothing wrong with that you need to do that, for your mental health, you need to do that to get yourself to a better place."
12799.0,Patient,"You should like though well I don't know how you're going to get there, I was going to take you and."
706.0,Provider,Then she starts like threatening you.
12799.0,Patient,"Literally bring me to the point of going oh my God woman. yeah well and that's why you don't get into a confrontation, where it has to be like a tit for tat and it just simply has to be."
706.0,Provider,"mom I just need i'm just gonna go get some air, you know not like you're mad at her not like she's doing something wrong not like anything like that just. mom i'm going to go get some air or i'm just going to take some space or you know I need to go do my devotional I don't know, do you do devotional with your do you have like a little book yeah. I need it will do my devotional for the day, whatever it may be because it's okay to take that time and don't feel guilty about that and."
12799.0,Patient,"green light step or. Two because i'm really into step three and i've been working it. Guy who are you going to bring my step work over to and because guys like window. When the desire when the moment when it strikes me, I like to just answer a couple of questions you know. it's a lot of writing you know answering a couple questions is actually a lot of writing so."
706.0,Provider,"So I mean, and right now you're."
12799.0,Patient,you're like.
706.0,Provider,"Long term goal is to maintain your recovery and. Have health have a good mental health, like you know that's like your main your main goal. And so, all of these things we're talking about with everyday things with family and events and stress and all of that all of those are like little goals that fall under that so. Being able to take a timeout if you need it practicing mindfulness remember, we talked about. The closing your eyes and visualizing all this light filling you up when you breathe in and then, when you breathe out all the negativity leaving your body. And for some reason, when you envision it from the top of your head to the tips of your toes all that negativity leaving or all that light filling you up, it puts you in a really good calm place. And sometimes that's all it takes and then you can go back to the situation with a different mindset because you're not so anxious."
12799.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know and it's just parents are hard, even if you're the best of friends like my mom is my best friend I love my mom to death. But I lived with my mom after she heard her arm she she. stepped on a Lego when she was holding my oldest son and she fell and she didn't want to fall on him so she turned and she broke her arm right up here like where those shoulder blade is. And it took a long time to heal and she had to have surgery, so I moved in with her with my son, and I will tell you love my mom to death, but cannot live with my mom like cannot spend all that time with my mom. Because we're too much alike. we're just too much alike, and so you and you and you find that you know with mothers and daughters, a lot of times, there are a lot of like so. And it's Okay, though, to tell her that mom i'm not mad at you i'm not upset I just I need to go do my devotional or I need to go practice some mindfulness it's nothing to do with you this is this isn't all me thing. So she doesn't think it's about her so she doesn't like well since you're mad at me i'm not going to drive you I was going to drive you but i'm not going to drive you because it has nothing to do with her anymore it's about you."
12799.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,"That make sense. yeah and really it is about you, because you need to get yourself into a better place you can't make her change, you need to get yourself into a better place and that's, the only thing you can change."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah I brought. On Monday, also you know I told you that the methadone clinic turned me down for going twice a week because I wasn't working or going to school. yeah yeah so they felt like I was like doing nothing, and so on Monday I brought them in my last week's slip. It had like 23 things on it and that's not even including this three days, I have to go there and and I and and I included a letter you know, stating that i'm i'm very involved with my recovery, which is what I thought this was all about in the. And then I said, the only reason i'm not working or going to school yeah this because i've been doing self care i've been getting my mental health. In order, and I call how fun. yeah and I said, you know which had, is what I thought was highly recommended in recovery so i'm doing everything right and you guys still turn me down. So I you know I said I wanted to give you this slip apparently I should have been giving you slips key all along, I wasn't aware of that. And I said but i'm going to keep bringing them because I want and I deserve to go to twice a week. And you know because I said, the only difference between me and the person actively using right now is that I go three times a week and they go every day. that's The only difference between me and them and and i'm so angry i'm going to call i've got. i've got the number for a lady I can call it the detox to find out what milligram I have to get down to you before I can check in for a couple weeks and just detox off the methadone period and then, if I feel like I need something after that and i'll get on suboxone. But I just I don't want to do this message on anymore, I mean had I been in a week or state that could have driven me right right to a relapse. Oh absolutely what they're doing and now. And then I got a call from my counselor yesterday she's still talking like that's not going to be enough. Is is what she sounding like and i'm like are you kidding me I said, you know i'm just angry i'm just fucking really pissed off I don't get it, I don't know what you guys want you know I feel like you're not for me, I feel like you're against me, and you know this is."
706.0,Provider,"Like your side, I am."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah I said I feel like you're pushing me to fail, not succeed and that's what I told her, and I said, you know I just don't I just don't get it, and I said, but you know, I hope that you bring that back into your team meeting which won't be until probably after new years. I know because the Fridays are going to be closes Friday and probably next Friday and that's when they do their team meeting so. That that will give me time to get another slipper to in you know so they can see it's not just a one week thing that it's an every week thing that I am as busy, as I am with the recovery thing and. So both on zoom and in person, and I said, you know, and my sponsor is willing to write a letter on my behalf. You know, stating how well i'm doing, and this and that, and so I think i'm going to let her write a letter for me and so that you know cuz she said yeah all the ammunition that you can give me the better yeah."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and it's probably cuz it's a it's a corporate thing it's probably like a corporate thing like until they have a job or until there is."
12799.0,Patient,it's the guys. sitting behind the desk that doesn't have a clue.
706.0,Provider,doesn't have a clue.
12799.0,Patient,Exactly all you seeing is is what's on paper and.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
12799.0,Patient,"Look i'm going to be applying for school, but this has to be in my."
706.0,Provider,time you have to have your base it's like building a house.
12799.0,Patient,You have.
706.0,Provider,"For a strong foundation, because if you don't have a strong foundation and you start building on that foundation that foundation is not going to hold what you're building."
12799.0,Patient,And I know.
706.0,Provider,Where we agree on your mental health. and your physical health.
12799.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,i'm so sorry.
12799.0,Patient,"yeah i'm fighting that I felt really bad about that I still feel really bad about that, so I told her I just feel like shit about this, I don't even understand. You know I said I said and I hate the fact that Th s is the only place that I can get message on through so there's nothing I can do."
706.0,Provider,My hands are actually out.
12799.0,Patient,"Here hundred. i'm still so very much controlled by a substance and by this company and I don't like it. at all, you know and we talked about, and I know you said getting off the method down."
706.0,Provider,"You know my professional opinion, if I can give it is that you were you know, an active user, for many, many years you were homeless. You were in an not great place and you got your brain and and not great place and it took a long time to get you to where you were. And it's going to take far longer than what you're going to give yourself to get back to a healthy place where you could potentially taper off all medication assisted treatment. If you want to come off the methadone, then I would simply tell them, I want to come off the methadone I want to start coming off the methadone I want to go on suboxone and tell them that's what you want to do, because there is a way to do that people do do that."
12799.0,Patient,"Well, I know I know I just I just it's just going to take a long time, and so and."
706.0,Provider,take a long time.
12799.0,Patient,yeah there's like people going down a milligram every two weeks and that's you know or a milligram a week and that's that's not bad enough for me I. Know George.
706.0,Provider,It should be your choice now you're in a different state so you're in Washington. i'm an iowa and I worked at a methadone clinic. And we had people that came in and were like i'm getting off my sit down in the next month. You know.
12799.0,Patient,So below.
706.0,Provider,Paper tape to tape they got they were going to prison and they're like I have to go to present so.
12799.0,Patient,I need to do.
706.0,Provider,This when I go.
12799.0,Patient,"yeah because they don't they are they don't they don't get suboxone or easy in prison, they do in County jails, but they don't in."
706.0,Provider,"Some county jails, yes, but some they don't but. My clinic was the clinic in the area that actually delivered the methadone to the jails, and I used to go and take it there. which I think is the way that it should be absolutely should be it's a medication people should be able to get it um. But you know, and I like I said, I would just simply tell them like I i'm i'm with another Program. I want to go, and I want to be on suboxone so I need to get I want to get off of this as soon as possible and I don't know you want to talk to doctors i'm Dr sal when we come back from break when we come back on my next week from Christmas break. And just asked her like if I wanted to do this, like now I didn't want to wait for months, how would I go about that, like what needs to happen because i've known people to go off of methadone and onto suboxone and vice versa, and it has not taken months and months and months so. And this would be a good time to do it because you are in a house where it pushes sobriety rather than when you're out of that house and you're out on your own and it's not necessarily your environment is pushing sobriety."
12799.0,Patient,Does that make sense yeah yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,I would talk to Dr sal.
12799.0,Patient,Just because.
706.0,Provider,"I feel bad for you, because you are doing so well and I don't want you to be discouraged by corporate rules that tell you you're not doing good enough, because you are doing good enough and I feel like once your mental health is where it needs to be which we are working on. Then you're going to be successful. at school or successful at a job. But right now I don't see you being successful because. You have your updates in your down days and on your down days you have no motivation."
12799.0,Patient,"No none absolutely none in tried it it sucks it's like in my mind, I want to do this, and I want to do that, I do this and I need to do that, and then I just i'm sitting here going. You know."
706.0,Provider,That is why. I want you to write yourself a note and stick it in your packet and I want you to take it with you this entire.
12799.0,Patient,holiday silver countable yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Hold yourself accountable and when you think I don't want to go do that you're gonna be like nope i'm going to pull my note out. Stacy says, I need to do this for my mental health."
12799.0,Patient,yeah I will like I said and my God people expecting me. as well. I know.
