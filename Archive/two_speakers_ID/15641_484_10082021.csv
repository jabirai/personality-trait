484.0,Provider,"It sounds like like you said you want to live another 20 years so. yeah yeah well good. Okay, so and then so just for the bright heart health, I know you got hooked up just with the harm reduction program is sort of just a way to get access to medications to help you with coming. down and then off of the using the heroin Brett Hearn health has a lot more support services than just the medications like meeting with a counselor regularly and groups and all sorts of stuff. Was that I."
15641.0,Patient,worked for five years as a counselor and I really. About burnt out with all that.
484.0,Provider,So not i'm not interested in all that stuff just.
15641.0,Patient,yeah when we go to prison I. stayed with sharepoint for five years yeah.
484.0,Provider,"When did you go to prison, how long ago was that long time ago, or recently."
15641.0,Patient,93.
484.0,Provider,"Oh, that was."
15641.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,Was that for drug related issues.
15641.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
484.0,Provider,yeah okay okay. um. So just to tell you a little bit about this is you starting the suboxone with us would be different than the way it sounds like you took it before.
15641.0,Patient,"You have to do that micro thing to don't you. that's what i'm gonna explain to you, does that really help."
484.0,Provider,"yeah so buprenorphine or Slovak buprenorphine is the one of the medication and suboxone it's an opioid, and so it actually will also pop up potentially help with your pain, which is good to know. We are, it can also be used certain certain forms of it can also be used for pain so. So the way i'm going to i'll start it for you is but it's it's very it's a very strong like you know the heroin goes into your body and attaches to all these little receptors in your body. The buprenorphine is actually stronger than the heroin so that's why it'll put you in withdrawal because it'll go in there and it'll kick the heroin out. But if we started at very low doses it'll just slowly get in your system and what you should notice slowly over the course of a week that we very slowly start this is. Is that you just won't feel like you need the heroin as much so we don't want you to stop the heroin because you're going to have what's your all right. What what i'm going to do is give them suboxone to you in very slow increasing doses so you're going to start with a very low dose. You don't want to take more because they'll put you withdraw you take the low doses that I tell you, and then you, you can keep using heroin. When you feel like you need it, but over the course of the week, you should feel like you need it less and less and not at all by the end of the week. Does that make sense. yeah so that's kind of the goal, the goal is that you should not have withdrawal symptoms if you're having withdrawal symptoms might be because you're you stopped the heroin kind of on your own but, but you know it should just be a natural process where you use less and less. hmm okay."
15641.0,Patient,yeah.
484.0,Provider,"um so. So don't kind of deliberately cut back just kind of cut back, as you feel like you need last like you said, if you. Like in the morning you don't need it then good you can take the suboxone instead in the morning and then how much you need throughout see much how much use of the heroin throughout the day. Okay. So I want to the way you have some instructions for it, or a little bit complicated, you have something to write this down it'll also be on the prescription, but I like to go over in detail with you. You got something to write it down or someone write down for you."
15641.0,Patient,"Yes, you ready."
484.0,Provider,Oh who's there with you.
15641.0,Patient,hi.
484.0,Provider,hi are you from any positive change.
15641.0,Patient,I am.
484.0,Provider,"Oh great hi. So. If you write this down just and then again, this will be on the prescriptions it's going to come as three separate prescriptions, just so you know and that's because we're changing the dose over time, and so it starts off on day one, where there's going to be a tablet and you have to. cut it into for Java pill cutter. Can you get a."
15641.0,Patient,get a pill better when you hold her. Right okay tablet they want to tell it cut into four.
484.0,Provider,"yeah so you're going to take just one quarter of that tablet so it's going to be a real small amount, but again, this is on purpose, because we don't want to put you on withdraw. And you're going to dissolve it and you know you just all that under your tongue, have you done that, before with suboxone."
15641.0,Patient,Remember.
484.0,Provider,"So you don't chew it up and swallow it you let it sit under your tongue until it dissolves and you don't want to eat or drink anything you know, at the same time, you want to relive it sit there until it dissolves."
15641.0,Patient,He ran down there.
484.0,Provider,"Not not right now, but it did rain, it was supposed to rain tomorrow, I think."
15641.0,Patient,cloudy up here.
484.0,Provider,"yeah it's cloudy here too. So you're going to the first day it's just going to be one with that one quarter of the tablet just once in the morning day to you're going to take the quarter tablet do it in the morning and do it again in the evening. Okay, just twice that on day two. Day three. you're going to take a quarter of the tablet in the morning."
15641.0,Patient,three.
484.0,Provider,"quarter of the tablet in the morning. And then, a half in the afternoon."
15641.0,Patient,Are we still cutting.
484.0,Provider,"yeah so it's going to be, these are going to all be I mean you can. You can cut the first pill into quarters, because you're ultimately going to use all for those quarters, and then the second pill, you can just cut it in half, because you're going to take a course on the day three and a quarter in the morning, so that's the last quarter that you have. And then you're going to take a half in the afternoon in the afternoon, and then a half in the evening. And that'll be. All two of those tablets."
15641.0,Patient,got it.
484.0,Provider,Okay.
15641.0,Patient,All right.
484.0,Provider,Now the next prescription for days four through six is actually going to be the suboxone combined. The first one doesn't have any of that doesn't have any of the naloxone in it and that's going to be your just that on day four you're going to take one whole tablet under your tongue twice a day. So one tablet under your tongue twice a day on day four. Day five you're going to do one and a half tablets under your tongue twice a day.
15641.0,Patient,"Wait wait. Sorry, no that's okay i'm going to type this up and give it to you okay day five."
484.0,Provider,Day five it's one and one and a half tablets. Under the tongue. One and a half in the morning and again in the later so it's twice that day.
15641.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,"So day for is twice one in the morning, one in the evening or in the late afternoon day five is also twice, but that time is one and a half tablets in the morning and in the evening. Okay, and then day six you're going to do two tablets in the morning two tablets later in the day. Okay. And then you're going to get. you're going to get the. The last prescription is going to be for it's going to be like an eight milligram week at that point we can switch you to a film or a tablet the film's kind of dissolve a little easier, so I can switch you to the film's then and that's going to be. 12 milligrams that you take just once a day. Okay."
15641.0,Patient,About eight milligrams.
484.0,Provider,Wait it's gonna come it's going to come as an eight milligram film.
15641.0,Patient,uh huh.
484.0,Provider,"you're going to see you can do, one and a half."
15641.0,Patient,Okay okay.
484.0,Provider,"Just makes it easier, over time, as we go up to get a you know bigger dose."
15641.0,Patient,So we do a. It comes in eight milligrams but you take 12 so we cut the bill right.
484.0,Provider,Okay yeah you want you'll cut it in you'll you'll have a.
15641.0,Patient,"One and a half, essentially who's your strips right."
484.0,Provider,So that's going to be stripped at that point you're going to start with the tablets and then you're gonna go to straps. Okay.
15641.0,Patient,"Okay, so. we're on a regular routine at this point. One time a day."
484.0,Provider,"Correct now here's the thing when you have chronic pain, sometimes splitting that into two doses might be better so i'd say take the 12 milligrams in the morning. And and see how it does, if you feel like your pain is bothering you, you could take you know six in the morning and six in the evening and that can sometimes be better for pain."
15641.0,Patient,No.
484.0,Provider,"No, no. Six milligrams. Which is like three quarters yeah no not six trips."
15641.0,Patient,I did once.
484.0,Provider,Oh that's something that's too much.
15641.0,Patient,yeah when to withdraw real bad.
484.0,Provider,I bet your dad not surprised.
15641.0,Patient,With pain.
484.0,Provider,yeah.
15641.0,Patient,yeah I didn't like it.
484.0,Provider,Now.
15641.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,"Now here um my question for you so i'm going to I can give you i'll give you this seven day prescription, but then you're going to need more and so you're going to have to reconnect with us right. Right, and so you know how to do that."
15641.0,Patient,"I come up here to his house, and I mean if you give us an appointment that works for me and he agrees, then I come to his house with your right heart health iPad."
484.0,Provider,"got it Okay, so I just want to make sure you know, maybe what i'll do is i'll give you what that other prescription i'll give you a little more than a week like give you. You know enough for attendees that will be just have a buffer to get you another appointment because I think how did you schedule this appointment."
15641.0,Patient,"We did okay so here's what we did, did we do the enrollment yes oh yeah so I just found out that he had medical he didn't even know yet. And so I came racing up here and I enrolled him. And then I specifically asked for an appointment with you, knowing that you do the micro dosing."
484.0,Provider,"Perfect Okay, so if you can just request another appointment it'll there's there are several of us that do this harm reduction, meaning it's just an access to manage without the full bright heart Program. Just just make sure you."
15641.0,Patient,But I think that he would prefer Am I wrong Chris that you would prefer to see you don't want to talk to each other.
484.0,Provider,"Well that's fine I am i'm i'm here every Thursday evening so if that timing works for you, that would be okay to reschedule with me for next week i'll just ask them to book with me for next week. Yes, let's do that would be can adjust the dose. Right me, let me."
15641.0,Patient,Do you remember my no Chris lives on the other side of the lake than the other person that this happened to but that that pharmacy the other person it didn't go smooth.
484.0,Provider,Is this the lake pharmacy.
15641.0,Patient,yeah he's going to lake pharmacy.
484.0,Provider,Which which which which.
15641.0,Patient,The first person that was a successful enrollment I hate to say people's names.
484.0,Provider,The name that person saw you.
15641.0,Patient,"But the prescription was not easily obtainable it wasn't like. Oh, see so i'm taking."
484.0,Provider,"A different pharmacy, though. Yes, I thought it was."
15641.0,Patient,good enough. But we're in hicksville so i'm not thinking that this is going to be any easier.
484.0,Provider,"Right. So here's the thing, though them. They that time the other issue was something with the system, I remember, because the the actual amounts didn't go through. So I think this time the way I put it in should be better. Cross my fingers, but if it doesn't they did reach out to me the next day, to try to fix it and I faxed them over an hour sent them a new one, I think it did get sorted out, hopefully. Right okay. Okay Okay, so I am putting so I have the lake pharmacy in here on lakeshore drive. Right and i'm putting this in. Now so i'm going to put these in actually while we chat if that's okay with you just to make sure it. goes through."
15641.0,Patient,And you know the grant that any positive change in hatcher are working under even though it's low barrier view if people if our participants want to avail themselves of counseling. yeah i've got a platform set up at better help. Oh so Alan somebody's email I Adam and they can do whatever they want.
484.0,Provider,"Okay i'm glad because I think you know as much support as as you want, and you need is is a good thing."
15641.0,Patient,Chris certainly knows how to reach out right.
484.0,Provider,Good good okay so just to be so i'm doing that and it'll be three separate prescriptions that i'm putting in for you now. Okay. i'm sending the first one i'll just kind of make sure it goes through through all your i've got you. Chris do you have any other questions for me.
15641.0,Patient,"No okay. No. Okay, so. I think it would be better for you, Chris if you called like pharmacy tomorrow to find out if they're ready, because you don't want to go all the way down the hill go through all that stuff read them find out, oh no we can't get back till whatever right next Monday."
