148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah sounds like. Everything you just listed with something that caused you stress to so naturally that's gonna. kind of bring you back into. The depression, anxiety everything that you know you cope with day to day stress can really trigger these things in us. and make even more challenging just to manage the stress right like now, I have to manage all these things as they're coming up for me. So the fact that you're doing so much self care now managing any I mean, are you having any stress right now coming up for you."

9218.0,Patient,I don't know if it's me being prideful or. I guess. What I want to say is. As. I guess I can kind of embarrassed because of stuff like that I don't know why i've always been set aside.
148.0,Provider,"it's okay to take compliment. Okay okay it's okay to take support and compliments and kindness from others, because when usually, when we're receiving that from other people that's what we're showing ourselves so that just means that you are doing really good work. And you know caring for yourself and being kind free time to yourself and being patient with yourself through this process. This is a journey it's not a destination right."
9218.0,Patient,I try to take one step at a time.

9218.0,Patient,I gotta remind myself to start eating breakfast in the morning.
148.0,Provider,"goal on that we can. monitor and check in about every week and group. breakfast in the morning it's even if you're just having some fruit or oatmeal. Just something right it's really good. I mean, I know a lot of people say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it really, really is it's really important not to skip breakfast because. breck fist actually means breaking your fast. So if you don't do that, and you. Your metabolism doesn't kick in right first thing in the morning, it may kick in whenever you start eating, but that could slow it down to so breakfast is actually a really important meal of the day. And again, it doesn't have to be anything super heavy it doesn't have to be anything um you know huge just something to put in your body to get get your body flowing and you know energize and give your body, the nutrition, it needs. Keep yourself healthy yeah. yeah alright, thank you, so I have you down Thursday October 28 at 12pm. enjoy the movie with your dad tomorrow."
