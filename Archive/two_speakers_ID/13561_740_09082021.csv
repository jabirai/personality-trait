But know if i'm close with my my siblings and close with my mom. The only negative thing i'd say about my family life growing up was. Emotions were discouraged. Patients. Pretty strongly discouraged, so I think that kind of became an issue for me."
740.0,Provider,i'm a.
13561.0,Patient,"perfectionist as a kid. very much a perfectionist and very self critical. And I. Had a hard time dealing with those kinds of emotions I. it's first, are you having suicidal thoughts when winners for. That I remember exactly when I it's weird it's funny how I remember that but. yeah those thoughts kind of started to creep into my head around age four. And they weren't they weren't pervasive I didn't have them all the time, but they weren't. I don't know, I think it was probably in response to some kind of emotional stress, I must have been under that time of my life I don't know. I went on to develop a pretty severe eating disorder. And that started when I was about 13 and I had that. Really until I was about 38. I was a believer. Mostly primarily blame. But then there was some anorexia in their periods of anorexia sometimes. Sometimes it was just for a long time it was just the bullying yeah but. yeah there was a little vulnerable."
740.0,Provider,And how many siblings do you have.
13561.0,Patient,On three.
740.0,Provider,um his mom's mom and dad together.
13561.0,Patient,"yeah. And it had a pretty. They fought a lot when. My dad was gone he traveled a lot for work so. I was all he was gone during the week and on hold on the weekends, but. If bottle on my parents bought a lot. yeah wasn't generally physical there one or two times I can recall, where it was. But. It was kind of stressful."
740.0,Provider,Right absolutely.
13561.0,Patient,We I think that's why i'm close with my siblings because we all kind of. We all huddle and. One of our bedrooms trying to kind of support each other.

13561.0,Patient,"You know, usually one of us would be crying and. Try to console each other."
740.0,Provider,month.
13561.0,Patient,"There were times it got pretty ugly it was pretty pretty stressful for us. yeah it's you know that was wasn't really something we talked about anybody. We didn't talk about their family there. And even at a siblings like we knew it happened, but we didn't like to talk about it. And I don't know why I think we just. Like to pretend like it didn't happen."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay. Well, thank you so much for sharing that. They anyone than the home struggle with any kind of mental health substance abuse or eating disorders."
13561.0,Patient,"So. I wonder, I don't think. Either my parents was really diagnosed with anything. I wonder, though, there was some. Like anxiety and depression, maybe my mom I know my biological dad side. there's an uncle that right yeah my biological dad's brother i'm pretty sure. he's dealt with suicidal ideation quite a bit on and he's made some. Comments said, I think. Definitely considered it I think he deals with major depressive disorder. I don't. Think it's ever been diagnosed."
740.0,Provider,So i'm. What. What would you like to work on or your treatment.
13561.0,Patient,"i'd like to work on trying to. stabilize my my emotions and how I react to things, both internally and externally. As you guys, have a lot of self destructive tendencies and sometimes. Especially lately they've kind of been becoming external. Taking things out on my husband or. Breaking things. just out of frustration throwing things away that have value to me. Why it's like it makes me feel better for for a short time."
740.0,Provider,"Do have those prayers wrong, what do you say you say California."

13561.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't know i'm sure they probably do that that would be pretty fun."
740.0,Provider,wouldn't it. So they use the offer it I don't know you know the APP moot point. If you get on groupon and you can look up some of those rooms and see if they have them and you could just pay half the price and going up and install breaking stuff.
13561.0,Patient,fun. yeah ED Crowley feel free.

You can break as much as you want, you can even have hammers and breaking we hammer suit."
13561.0,Patient,"Doing that like on a TV show one time, I thought it looked like."
740.0,Provider,"i'm list i'm sure it will be a great release ask them if they have a membership, so you can go as much as you want when you feel like right good stuff guys leave your stuff alone, and you go break this stuff. Right, I was like listen you say too much money we go stuff we re you go break this stuff for half the price. Okay, good deal. um so I have to stabilize the motions The self deconstruct behavior. Anything else. sounds like a little bit of anger."
