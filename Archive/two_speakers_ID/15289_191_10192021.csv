191.0,Provider,All right.
15289.0,Patient,"me wanting to do it, you know."
191.0,Provider,"So let me ask you this is there anything you're able to change so that if you, because we know arguments will come up will come and go with the people we love doesn't mean we don't love them. But if I change."
15289.0,Patient,yeah actually right now I change it's it's a lot with my boyfriend you know 12 years and I just i'd had enough and I just got to the point where I just left him completely. And going from there now so.
191.0,Provider,we'll see healthy was that a healthy relationship.
15289.0,Patient,"We did, I mean it wasn't bad mean I time but there's been times that we fought a lot and the drugs. I don't feel like maybe he's not as ready, as I am to. not continue with the LIFE like that you know. he's not ready to stop doing drugs, and I am and. You know I told him, you know, even though, like. I have an addiction my myself, you know as I don't blame him or anything like that, but with him being around me and doing the thing that makes it hard. And I don't want to use I don't want to do it, but at the same time, like, I feel like when he's around me all the time, and he has it and seven makes it that much harder on me."
191.0,Provider,"that's very wise decision, you made a wise decision and the truth is samantha when you choose to your sobriety over using drugs it's really like you choose in life over death. Because you just never know. Because they're still making newer drugs that are more potent so."
15289.0,Patient,yeah I mean.
191.0,Provider,opportunity for a better life.
15289.0,Patient,"We do I mean, I just have so many friends like that's died and passed away, you know from dirt drug use and that I went to school with and then just some that's just completely. A whole different person, just like you don't even know who they are. They don't even know who they are, you know and it's just bad to see. And you know, one of them times, it could be me or him and i'm just like you, you know I don't want to waste that time anymore i've wasted enough time on my iPhone my kids have suffered enough for the things that i've done so. I believe my. Do you agree with that decision I I definitely agree with it."
191.0,Provider,"I do, too, I was very wise it took a lot of courage."
15289.0,Patient,"yeah it's hard, but at the same time it's, the best thing and I just if he doesn't want to go down that road with me, then I guess you know that's where we're at."
191.0,Provider,yeah so.
15289.0,Patient,it's been hard but i'm getting through like my mom and them are very helpful me my mom normally don't argue or fight. So.
191.0,Provider,"Have you. Have you, that was a tough decision, and you know some things I don't think they always tell us is that the really. Good decisions, a sometime the tougher decisions when you do bad that's oftentimes not it's not hard to do, but it is much easier, sometimes to make the right decision, so the good thing that helps helpful for you. Right sounds like you did that. You know the good thing about making positive and correct decisions it's like building muscles, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Right yeah."
15289.0,Patient,that's totally true yeah so this urine drug screen from.
191.0,Provider,"1017 the show what you said you say it does have you buprenorphine, but it has been fed me your marijuana and you amphetamine so so. last one."
15289.0,Patient,"that's what I was like what is that, like."
191.0,Provider,You should have break down product of crystal meth and then marijuana. Are you smoking marijuana.
15289.0,Patient,"yeah I smoked. marijuana yeah so yeah. That is the hardest thing for me is to not move because I felt like. I could be having such a terrible day or be so stressed out or my anxiety can be so high, and me just be jittery or just. there's just times that i'm just a restless I can't sleep or i'm just tossing and turning are you know, and when I smoke, it helps it does help me that's why I turned to that you know I mean i'd rather i'm not saying that's a great thing but it's a lot better than. me doing the other and. I don't know it just it does help my anxiety and stuff at times, I just have high anxiety, I feel like around way they're always really fidgety and don't know what to do, or I feel like i'm not doing enough or I just can't sit still. For there's times that i'm just like man, I cannot asleep I just toss and turn, and so I don't know."
191.0,Provider,"Well, I tell you what I appreciate you for sharing it with me and you're right a lot of people do notice that, when they take the marijuana initially. It helps but i've had people slowly come off the marijuana. You know not usually, when they first start but as they get stronger and we deal with mental health issues they're able to come off the marijuana and actually noticed they feel better because it is a mind and mood altering drug it does impact your lungs and a negative way. i'm even concerned about the impact it could potentially have on a heart and so it's really not something healthy so just like I wouldn't advise smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. don't ask the marijuana so. we're going to work on that. also want you to stop the. crystal meth you know some of my young. who have heart attacks or. congestive heart failure, where the heart heart, does it squeezes as well, like this it may just kind of do this, and so they're always tired and always as well and. there's usually, when they're young there's usually because of stimulant use be a crack cocaine or crystal meth so for your health because I believe you have a bright future samantha. I want your heart to be working once your kidneys to be working Okay, so I want to encourage that you not do those those okay. And we talked about the risk, I want to see you for a mental health appointment. Okay, so I hear that you do the marijuana for relaxation. And for sleep. And so we have medications that we can put you on that can help you with relaxation dealing with anxiety or depression that can deal with sleep and we don't have to worry about it being mixed with fentanyl. When I haven't been. With Ecstasy, and all this other stuff."
15289.0,Patient,"I think that's The only other thing that it gets stressed out about is because, like I get sometimes my kids like I just get so. crappy with them, you know I don't even know the word for it and. They don't deserve that sometimes but it's just like so I try to walk away or I just try to go for a walk. them because I just can't like I try to control it, you know to a point, but sometimes I just can't."
191.0,Provider,"And you know something miss samantha. you're doing the right thing you put your sobriety first and guess what whenever we're using drugs or doing something to deal with emotion, as opposed to dealing with them ourselves. Sometimes we don't know how to deal with them, we have to be taught, we have to learn it's kind of like a person if they go to pick up 100 pounds. They may not be to pick it up instantly but you slowly you build your way your muscles, you know you live five, then you get stronger you live tan. sobriety is like that that's why you have therapists you have me, you have your group, we want to you to help build those emotional muscles and you'll get there, but I want you to have patience with yourself because. It may not happen that usually doesn't happen overnight. Right. yeah and when you decide to do the right thing, sometimes the dope boys are showing up more and all kinds of things are happening that you say something in the."
15289.0,Patient,Past that has really happened.
191.0,Provider,"doing the right thing. take that as a side right thing, because they know they losing you. Know pick pick. put up. front okay. But you can't persevere and okay wanna hurt you keep your appointment so okay. Once you get your laps done, have you heard from anything anybody about your laps."
15289.0,Patient,"I was just checking my emails like the last couple of days and I seen where she had emailed me back about she finally said the backs over or whatever, so all my sisters next day off, which should be this week, sometimes she'll run me down there, she said and i'll get it done."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so once you to call I want you to call the where you had your laps confirm that the order was received and ask them beforehand, when you should show up do you need to make an appointment, or can you walk in. So you. always want to confirm that they received it, because i've sent stuff and it shows sent on my end but for. some reason, because you know, the fact is. If there's a glitch it'd be in virtual space so. If it was sent, and when you can show up so you're not wasting your time okay."
15289.0,Patient,"Okay yep. All right, sure well."
191.0,Provider,"All right now, let me ask you this, this is your safety protocol, have you had any thoughts or plans of harming yourself or anyone else."
