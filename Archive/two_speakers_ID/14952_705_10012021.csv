705.0,Provider,hi Craig.
14952.0,Patient,hi Valerie how are you.
705.0,Provider,Great how are you.
14952.0,Patient,"there. bit of a process to learn. You know everything that how bright heart operates so i'm a little dazed and confused being as old as I am, but I got it down."
705.0,Provider,"here to and then what I usually do too, because sometimes when we have our sessions, it takes I don't know why, but sometimes with putting on the video, so I have a way to ask you to start video, and so, if you see it, you can just hit."
14952.0,Patient,"Yes, sure. Oh, I wasn't in there i'm sorry."
705.0,Provider,"No worries your word, you were there audio and again with zoom it gets sensitive like a minute ago I could see that you were there and then it disappeared, and so, just like you did re enter come back and then we get it."
14952.0,Patient,"Well, good i'm glad you can see me now, and I can see me too So yes."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, so thank you for coming in, today, and my name is Valerie i'm part of the brain heart health team here and. What we're going to do today is a little bit different than a counseling session a counseling session we would explore more we talk about coping skills, sometimes we take these detours today have had before a bio psychosocial. assessment. Yes, okay so it's a little bit different than you remember what the questions were gathering History also currently of what's going on."
14952.0,Patient,my finger yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're like already you're like Okay, I know what this is."
14952.0,Patient,Well yeah so that's just kind of what I expected yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And the reason why I mean, for you know, especially here in today is. If we can collect more information we get to know a little bit better picture of what's going on where we can help you best. And then I also like to you know draw on your strengths and be able to say you know, this is an area that we can even have more highlight here this other area may be problematic we'll take a look over there, see. You know, because it's always up to you, of what you want to explore more what you do not."
14952.0,Patient,right that sounds smart.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I know how it is that if, if you want to invest in it, he feel like you have a choice because I know I like choices, then i'm more motivated to do it, but if I feel like I don't have a choice it's kind of like. This."
14952.0,Patient,Right right that makes sense to.
705.0,Provider,"What i'm going to do too and you'll see me look to the sides, I have a guideline with different questions so if you see me look to the side or down that's what i'm doing."
14952.0,Patient,"And I have some paper here, I might be taking some notes too."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, yes, so before we get going. Privacy confidentiality very important not only to me, but to braveheart probably you also. If someone calls me tomorrow and they're outside of my heart, health and they're like, can you tell me, you know you and Craig matt what was the outcome, I can't confirm or deny I know you. You would first have to sign the consent form then i'm able to do that. Other than that everything is confidential. With the exception of if you're going to hurt yourself we're going to get you the help that you need and support you if you say that you're going to hurt someone else we're going to get them help that they need any help that you need if it's an emergency then call proper care. Right, other than that mandated reporters for child protective services or adult protective services and that's really I mean you seem like you've had this before, so you you pretty much know the basic okay. yeah any questions on anything before we get going."
14952.0,Patient,I don't think so i'm just really kind of looking forward to getting going I need some help right now and i'm excited to get it and. that's I mean that's about it honestly yeah. just put it in a nutshell.
705.0,Provider,I like where you started off with that and it goes right into the first question of reason why you joined bright heart health.
14952.0,Patient,"Well um the short story is that a couple years ago I. Clearly, had a drinking problem and my friends knew it my family knew it and I had you know basically an intervention and my also my physician knew it and so. I had kind of partnered with a couple friends one was kind of looking after my kind of household sort of things finances and all that and just keeping all that. On the rails and the other one press my other friend Chris was kind of my sort of medical companion, and he was going to the doctor with me and I had some labs done. it's a very short version of the story, and I was going to the doctor, my primary care physician and expecting to see the labs and have some recommendations. For follow up care we had already identified that place in sausalito called out Mira, where I was going to go for rehab. And I expect to go to the doctor and have him say okay off to our mirror and, instead, he said i'm admitting you today to ucsf because these labs are that bad, and so I ended up spending about six or seven weeks in the hospital because liver damage and. They were apparently was really quite I shouldn't say, apparently, it was quite severe the damage, I had done and I had no idea that it happened. But I pulled through and. then went to an Inpatient physical rehabilitation place here in San Francisco called the avenues to get my strength back before and I took a couple weeks before I went to altamira Finally, and I spent a couple months at altamira, then I went to a. sober living environment i've been around for a couple months and then came home literally the week that coven kind of exploded, and so. I spent gosh like a whole year really kind of isolated, which was one of the biggest factors that sort of drove my alcoholism because. Now we're sort of going back in time prior to this really accelerated drinking problem. I had been really kind of heavy social drinker all my friends are because I hold them sort of fondly not in a critical way, whose bags, you know we just love to entertain go out and we go on vacations and cruises and. it's just real funds are party focus group, and then I think the major kind of accelerators in my turn game where the loss of my husband of 23 years. To a brain tumor he got glioblastoma eight years ago, and he lived very productively for three he had brilliant treatment ucsf and very fortunate tumor biology so hardly any data sets but then as glioblastoma always does, it can be wearing back and very quickly died. And at the end. And that was incredibly traumatic. For me and for all of us really. And so I had that sort of trauma I guess we'll call it. same time I had a horrendous job that I truly am actually I really liked my job I hated the work environment. And it was extremely difficult and, at that time I was experiencing a really incredible amount of pain and motor difficulty because both my hips for failing. And so I separated with my job at uc Berkeley i'm a fundraiser and I was working at the College of engineering and we sort of agreed to go our own ways they I think they think they fired me, I think we separated. Because. I probably could have sued them. For some of the things that they did during my FM la leave with Troy and my own medical issues, it was really cruel and hostile place to work and they knew it. Especially for somebody in my level and so anyway that's another kind of trauma. And then. So I wasn't working for a while and then I had my hips replaced sequentially. which was great. And really sort of life changing honestly and then. But at the same time I drinking was kind of accelerating and. My dad had this really amazingly complicated and i'm sure we'll explore this more as we develop a relationship had this incredibly complicated. Cancer battle and then he died. And he was one of my very best friends and I was incredibly difficult for me, so I had. Two huge losses. And then, this. Work situation in this health situation and I think it just completely overwhelmed me. And this historical. habit of drinking heavily and it just turned into this disaster. mm hmm, and I mean, I think I mean that's My simple way of explaining it I don't know if that makes any real sense to you at this early stage, psychologically. But those are the kinds of things, those are the big triggers that lead to you know I mean any kind of genetic predisposition whatever aside. to lead to this problem and so anyway, for two years I was completely sober I think I had a terrific recovery and then in May, I had a relapse. So a few months ago and got back on the wagon pretty quickly and then recently i've had a really hard time staying on the wagon. and So I really need to. To find the. sort of determination and the inspiration and the commitment to get back to where I was because I was really successful and was able to deal with situations like going to Las Vegas with my booze bag friends and beings over the whole time and. And going up to their one of my best friends, two of them a couple that I know have a. beautiful house in napa that is like party central for us and God there many times and not had it had anything to drink, while they all party like crazy around me, and you know, so I have been really, really successful, but all of a sudden, I don't have that sort of drive. To do it, and my primary care physician, who has a at ucsf who has a research interest in addiction alcohol addiction, the last time I saw her and we're in constant contact. Well, not constant but frequent. said, you know there's this noticed, as I was talking to her about it, you probably have to that there's a certain. ambivalence to my description of what's going on right now, you know it's like. it's not exactly fatalism, but it's just like. Just sort of dress and. I just like I said I just lost that determination and. So that's why i'm sort of seeking now is. The tools and the. inspiration just pull it together, because I have a really, really fragile live, and I am not looking forward to dying crowns dead. Once and. yeah so I just need to I need to pull I need to get my shit together pardon my French and he do it quickly."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I appreciate you sharing that and Craig have heard the word ship before and it does sound like you're pulling your shit together. Partners coming into day you're doing it and, and so, and you know when you're sharing about what you went through and i'm really sorry to hear like. With your husband and that big loss, then you had your own health, you had your parents health it's like you just kept moving forward kept moving forward."
14952.0,Patient,"yeah that's true, that is true, I mean I should give myself a little bit of credit for that i'm."
705.0,Provider,"A lot of credit for that yeah yeah and to me, it makes sense, then Craig that after applying it got to where you're not motivated anymore, because it's like you exhausted it you're beyond exhausted."
14952.0,Patient,"I am exhausted and just recently to. i'm so excited about it, but it is exhausting i'm not gonna lie my mom who's 83 and fantastic and she is my best friend for sure she's just crazy. In the best way and actually sing with me right now I picked her up at the airport yesterday. She lives, she my parents will report on almost 20 maybe exactly 20 years ago kind of by accident, and this is not something you need to really know a lot about, but my dad's job right when he was going to retire or just before he was going to retire I guess. moved up there and. Very unexpectedly, and they went up and then really enjoyed it and stayed up there and but we're from northern California really and. And so my dad passed away it's been a few years now, and my mom. doesn't really want to live there anymore, and so she's looking at retirement communities down here to be closer to me, I have a brother who lives in Virginia that's a whole nother story and. And so we've been looking at retirement Community she's downsizing she's 83 and she has some health issues. That are mildly concerning and she wants to live in a retirement community that has independent living where she'll enter. And also assisted living and also memory, care should cheated, and so that has been a crazy adventure trying to nail all that down. And that's really why she's here because we think we found the place, but she hasn't seen it i've been there twice, and so you know the financial advisors are involved. it's just been nuts and then. Just before she came here she was in wyoming. And a dear dear friends from high school my parents were highschool sweethearts and they have a place in wyoming that my dad. was a crazy fly fisherman, and it was very favorite place to go fly fishing the green river runs through it. And the scattered part of his ashes there this week so it's been a very emotional week I drove home from Oregon my mom was in my own for health issues. And they're scattering my dad's ashes, and now we're going to go see this retirement place to try to seal the deal, which is a huge financial commitment and as just my head is exploding, you know. So there's also a recent. Very anxiety. Producing. an emotional kind of job will just emotional stuff going on, too, so you know it's just like whoa oh and i'm also not working, by the way."
705.0,Provider,"yeah together Craig is you know, is a recipe for just like all of it coming to a head feeling exhausted, and if you don't have any other coping skills it's usually alcohol has been the one that the brain remembers even though it's been years."
14952.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's true it's it's like a haul back I think i'm in a sort of a fallback mode, you know I feel like i've sort of regressed sort of emotionally into this position that i'm in and. So I almost feel like i'm starting from scratch, I sort of wonder I don't need to go back to rehab or, can I just pull it together, you know. Because I was super super sick when I went to rehab I mean I definitely needed to be there and. They went instead of 30 days I went for 60. You know, so I was there for a long time. And it was incredibly helpful and i'm super grateful that not only I could go down to mirror, which is you know sort of the cadillac of rehabs. But, also, that I have the resources, in large part thanks my husband, which also causes some. Some sort of guilty feelings that i'm using these resources that he sort of gave me for this ridiculous problem that I have and. By not working for five years. And then i've got this other issue where I think that uc Berkeley is this horrible place I work I feel fearful that they are. going to torpedo any chance that I have of getting a job in a similar field right, so the as in terms of providing a reference and so i'm just you know there's just. there's a fear and anxiety and guilt sort of all around me and it's sometimes it's just hard to get out from under well it's almost always hard to get out from under him."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and that's the question to Craig is trying to see because there's so much at at you know coming at you at once it's like okay. Can you do this in a less less structured environment, can you do this, you know, like, how can I assist you to pull in those supports now while you're going through all this, too, and if you believe you have those resources."
14952.0,Patient,yeah yeah yes exactly yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And what you have really going for you, that maybe you know you, it seems like we put in the back burner there it's like. How many years of sobriety did you have."
14952.0,Patient,Almost exactly two.
705.0,Provider,Some people can't get through two hours. yeah so you had the two years you know what it's like. And now it's about you know and you're being open and honest so i'm hearing part of it is how to how to get you back to be motivated.
14952.0,Patient,"Yes, I think that's exactly the challenge um yeah I really do."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and. I think that that's probably to a good like already recovery, you know I call them wellness assignments to start just plugging away of Okay, you know what what is my motivation, what do I get. You know, we talked about the rewards and addiction being that off of the reward system is, we want to feel like hey what do we gain from being sober."
14952.0,Patient,yeah i'm writing that down.
705.0,Provider,"i'm hearing one of your biggest like hey, this is a win is your health."
14952.0,Patient,"it's true. and yeah and how do I measure that i'm a pretty like logical literal person and so things like measurements are important to me and. One of the things my doctor explained to me and I won't get into the details, but I was having a hard time understanding like why my lab reports looked so good and kind of normal and that it was a problem for me to have a drink. And so, she did this kind of a nap analogy of like Okay, if your liver used to be a football now it's like a golf ball. Actually I think she said baseball and she had to baseball and she's like so it can put out these enzymes enzymes in your blood, but it's only a baseball and so. So it's you know it's so diminish that if you have a drink right you're on this precipice that like you just have a tiny margin of error, where you can't get smarter than baseball because then you die. yeah so it was really interesting and so those kinds of measurements like what do I get what's the reward how do I measure it. was kind of important to me, but then i'm also then I get consumed by all these anxieties and procrastination and you know I don't go to the gym and I don't you know don't go on my walks and you know. it's. it's finding the motivation to do it, so I can measure it now."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and I think that that's important to have you know you probably have heard the term smart goals is making sure you know that there."
14952.0,Patient,"Yes, I certainly know about those."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and where you know it goes down, is it realistic, is it something that is measurable and and you just go down, each one of those. And that's exactly what what we can work on as you go through this it's like okay. Part of to what i'm hearing because it's so easy to get overwhelmed is all these things that are happening and it's almost like. Here we are today and you're thinking about what's going to happen after this and then I have to do that is. starting to have some coping strategies of how to pull you back into today and is it meditation that you've tried before to try to ground you. Or is it something else that you're going to be able to see like you know part of what's exciting to me is that exploration, you know it's like Okay, I get to explore. But if you don't know yet what you like you rule things out so you try meditation if it's guided meditation you don't like it it's done try something else there's different forms of meditation. Exercise like usually you were saying with exercise. Can you create goals that have some flexibility. Because, if you like, variety and you're giving yourself, only the I have to do this so many times and then you feel disappointment. And then I cycles you back to drinking. It defeats the purpose of setting maybe some of your goals. yeah yeah yeah So let me ask you this, then. motivation, you have today to be sober."
14952.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,What would that be.
14952.0,Patient,"um I think a couple things come to mind um. Oh, my God so many things actually now, as I start to think about it, I think, being able to be. Healthy. and have a longer life. i'm. Being able to be a better. son to my mom and to alleviate her worries about my health."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14952.0,Patient,"Being able to be a more sort of. not exactly trusted but I will use that word I guess trusted friend for my incredible circle of friends. I have like this pack of about 14 friends, and we have been like glue for years and at altamira, for example. It never done anything like this, but my psychologist there came up with this idea, before I was discharged and he said, I want to bring. your friends together and then wanted to like an hour long seminar, and I want you to open it and then all speak about. You know, so it will be like you're speaking for 10 minutes and then all speak for 20 and then we can have an open discussion for as long as the last but I don't think it would be longer than an hour. And about you and your addiction and how they can be friends supportive friends for you after your discharge. never done anything like i'm just you know we'll talk about it, and what you know how to structure it in more detail, but that was the general concept and they've never done anything like it. And then, if you guys want to hang out, you know for a little while you can, but you know we have limits on how long the servers can be around and so on and so forth. and It was so awesome and every single person I invited came and we're still just thick as thieves and. So. And I do feel like the odd man out a lot of the time. In part, because all of them except for one who had an divorce, they weren't actually married but. Now i'm a single guy and that's really weird. But it's and of course I don't drink but i'm called to a little bit now. But not around them, and so. Anyway, I just need, I would like to regain my kind of. position in that group as kind of one of the ringleaders you know, I was sort of at the top of the pile you know, in terms of my contributions to that group. In terms of energy and and sort of social contribution and I just don't feel like i'm there anymore."
705.0,Provider,Quite that's.
14952.0,Patient,Just important to me.
705.0,Provider,"yeah So those are some really good you know I could see where those would definitely be able to be goals, she could work on those and then bringing it back into today and."
14952.0,Patient,"we've got to get a job to I need to stop burning money. Honestly, and I don't mean to imply that i'm like crazy rich because i'm not crazy rich I just been fortunate to have to have some fun, so that I can. So I can live. But now i'm starting to burn into things like you know retirement funds, and that means to stop so I need to get a job and i'm need you know I just had a meeting with my financial advisor who's also my mom's financial advisor and. And we're not rich people, believe me. and But you know we're okay and. And so she's just starting to get worried and she's like okay well you know it's time for you to do real look at your budget and because we're using money that he should not be using now. And even if you have to just get a job everybody's hiring So even if you just have to get a job you know your local molly stones or whatever, just to get some cash flow and stop paying for health care. That might be something you need to look out now. Because we're really burning through money that you don't want to spend."
705.0,Provider,"and part of that is you're gonna you know rediscover with recovery is it's about getting yourself back. Out there and where we're talking about discovering that new motivation and with work, sometimes it can give you like sense of purpose, it can give you where you're not having idle time you know at the House and. Those types of things and so absolutely I like what you're you're already focusing on a lot of things Craig that. A lot of people I meet with they don't have any of those things so it's just like Okay, now we know you have a support system it's tapping into that even more so, of what you want, you have the family that's supportive to will build on that. Yes, just getting you to just take each day. Like how do I keep myself sober today. here's what it's going to be and then build on that and each day just be like okay."
14952.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Okay yeah I think idle time is my biggest enemy. um. it's funny also my my psychologist. At. altamira. I can't even talk at the same time. He at our second meeting. He he remarked that. In kind of telling my sort of life story, he said you're the first person i've ever met was. That in our initial meeting never brought up drinking. And I was like I didn't. know and you're here altamira and not once here are the you know the big white sheets of paper that I, you know, took all the notes on and there's nothing here at all about trying to get. All the way to the President, he didn't mention you know the hospital or you know the rehab the physical therapy rehab or anything you just didn't it just didn't come up. You know, we talked about being born and why and your parents paying from why in highschool sweethearts and where you went to college and being a singer, and all this other stuff and. going to Berkeley and you know your jobs and how you how much I hated your last job and you went on for hours about that and not ours, but you went on for a long time about that and. Talk about all your friends all the TRIPS you go on, and all this stuff and there is Troy, of course, and your dad there's nothing. was really interesting. um. yeah somehow there's a there's a weird filter in my brain, I guess, but. I don't know that just works in a weird way."
705.0,Provider,"it's it's it. I guess it depends on how you view the word weird because if it's weird and you think weird isn't unique and then, absolutely we all have unique brains and we all process things different. And i'll and I know as we get to know one another to we'll talk more about even those core beliefs if it's a core belief and it's something, you know that built in time and how to take a look at that and disputed. You probably have had some cognitive behavior therapy and your different past treatment. Yes, okay well that's that's good, and so, if you already have this Foundation, this is more of like Okay, how can we draw on what you've had before bringing it in today and then like I said just every week it's like okay. This is all you know you have that foundation of two years you didn't lose that. yeah if anything relapse is where you learn about yourself and you learn how you got there, and all those things, and sometimes it takes time to even know like what did draw you in."
14952.0,Patient,"I guess yeah. Oh, and you know, speaking of prior treatment I should probably mention that, too, because you know, obviously there's been some euro. So after altamira I didn't mention that I went to a program at the same time, I was. going to the oh was that I was living at the sober living environment, I was going to a program in because that's important era, but it's in around somewhere. Maybe since nfl doesn't matter but it's called mind therapy I don't know if you've heard of them, and they do everything from php and I op to individual therapy and I was, I was doing there I O P and. I still meet every other week by phone with one of their therapists named Neil corbin and I meet with him and my mom. And he's terrific and. Sometimes I think it's more of a window for my mom into my therapy than a real family therapy session but I like them a lot, and so does my mom and I think they're out sessions and then also when I was at. Mine therapy, I was assigned to a counselor name tanya doubting and a psychologist and. She was a. motorbike dragon say. So I saw her I guess weekly and then she left mine therapy and went into private practice in San Francisco and when. I left my therapy, since I live in San Francisco I continued with her quite a long time, probably I probably saw her for a year and a half, and then I started to feel like we were just kind of hitting a dead end and not making a lot of progress. I thought she was incredible in the beginning and super helpful and very grateful for all the work that we did, but I did leave her. kind of. I guess. Was would have been I don't know how many months ago, probably eight. Eight months ago, maybe, and I started looking for a new therapist but. Between the ones, it was very difficult to find one that was. In network and accepting patients, and I think a lot of that was due to coven."
705.0,Provider,seems.
14952.0,Patient,"A lot of people were just totally slammed. So I never bought a new weekly counselor, and so I was relying on Neil every other week and I don't know what effect that had on my relapse I don't think a lot, because my sessions with tanya were becoming aggravating. And so, and she sensed it for sure, which I talked about it. Frequently and. So anyway there's back and then quite a long time before that. I barely remember his name. I had seen a guy Oh, I actually don't remember his name right now isn't funny. Oh yeah Michael graves Michael graves, I saw for a while. Also."
705.0,Provider,"in San Francisco well, thank you for that for that information and, again, as we go through will either do more of it um with the relapse to if you want to get a jumpstart on it Craig is part of it is just writing about it is therapeutic and you know try not to edit just right. yeah Okay, and then the next guideline to I have it's more you might have had this one before it says safety protocol is Columbia risk and protective factors it's along with suicide. And so, part of what we do in our assessment today is asking in your lifetime, have you ever wished that you could go to sleep and not wake up or wish that you were dead in your lifetime."
14952.0,Patient,No.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and today, do you have any any thoughts about harming yourself."
14952.0,Patient,Though to others.
705.0,Provider,And I know you mean that in a like you're not comparing. going to kill kill somebody you. Just in.
14952.0,Patient,General have just people haven't maybe job offers.
705.0,Provider,"And again, I know we're laughing but i'm gonna bring it back to I know you're saying that you're not like directly like i'm going to kill so and so it's just more of a figure."
14952.0,Patient,Absolutely i'm completely joking about that.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and then what the suicide to know history of ever having suicidal thoughts, a plan and to never have you wrote a suicide note or collected pills or bought a gun or. anything like that Okay, I know what we do to in the in the last three months, have you had any significant losses to just legal, financial relationship. No Okay, do you own any weapons like such as firearms in your home. No Okay, can you share if you have any belief that suicide is immoral, or you have a fear of death and dying of pain and suffering."
14952.0,Patient,If suicide is immoral. Or can you just read that one more time.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I know it's on there a little bit belief that suicide suicide is immoral like you have a high spirituality and maybe."
14952.0,Patient,It is.
705.0,Provider,against your belief system.
14952.0,Patient,know.
705.0,Provider,A fear of death or dying due to pain and suffering.
14952.0,Patient,i'm a little bit yeah.
705.0,Provider,Do you feel a responsibility to continue to live because of family and friends and others.

Great so all that is covered there and then what I like to do. What I can do Craig, if you like, we can do this, a couple of different ways, with scheduling the first individual if you feel more comfortable going through the virtual clinic. Then you can do that if you feel comfortable today, I can look at the calendar and see if there's a day that we can go ahead and."
14952.0,Patient,"schedule right, I like that a lot."

14952.0,Patient,Well i'm not working right now i'm generally.
705.0,Provider,Free okay reference of afternoon evening.
14952.0,Patient,"um well if we're going to schedule, do you think it will be a recurring meeting, or do we kind of go one, at a time."
705.0,Provider,"What we can do is probably to start off it's usually like one and then, if I project into the next month, like November we could get more of an even pattern. Okay right now it's going to probably not line up if we're looking for every week."
14952.0,Patient,"Okay, so, then I would say my preference would be for probably an afternoon."
705.0,Provider,and your groups are going to be on what day of the week. Do you know which one you're going to be in the. evening okay okay good okay. So if I look at. i'd see the six. just looking at the calendar here.
14952.0,Patient,Six is not going to be great for me.
705.0,Provider,"Alright well you know Craig that's going to line up because, unfortunately, on that day, it looks like it's booked on the six. Okay, seven This basically the same, but let me go into. eight."
14952.0,Patient,i'm wide open on the eighth.
705.0,Provider,"On October the Eighth, I have a five o'clock at five o'clock would work and if not, I can look at the next week."
14952.0,Patient,"Five o'clock good. Okay, for the next week is fine to."
705.0,Provider,"Totally up to you if if October the eighth at five if that works or i'm going to go in just to take a peek here into October the 13th would be a Wednesday. And that one has a little bit more flexibility and schedule, like, I can see where there's a four o'clock there's a five o'clock on Wednesday, the 13th if any of those seem better."
14952.0,Patient,"um. I think, maybe the 13th of four will be better."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
14952.0,Patient,Is that too far out should we shoot for the eighth.
705.0,Provider,"it's up to you Craig do you do you feel like the 13th is you know, do you feel right now that you need more support and that we should check in on the eighth. kinda yeah. Why don't we do you want to do both we can do October the eighth. and October the 13th that October the 13th we could schedule it for and then October the eighth I can look again at what that time was that was a five o'clock."
14952.0,Patient,Maybe we could we do something earlier on the haters that you're only time.
705.0,Provider,"So far in the evening, that was the only time there, but let me look and see if. Fridays there's a couple of groups that I facilitate so i'm sorry on that day, it would the five o'clock is literally the last appointment, on that day for the eighth let me see just by chance of anything. Now, not nothing's on the Seventh and then the Wednesday, nothing was there and I think that was not good for you."
14952.0,Patient,Over there.
705.0,Provider,Is that going to be OK October the eighth at.
14952.0,Patient,"ya think so, I think I can make it happen."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, for any reason, if you decide that it's not going to work out just called a virtual Center cancel and reschedule and they have access to my calendar. Okay yeah so i'm going to go ahead, then why we're talking and book this where I can confirm."
14952.0,Patient,And then I think the 13th also probably be smarter.
705.0,Provider,"Good because it does fill up and then that way, at least, you know those are the days, you can see what you think about meeting in the afternoon if it works for you or not."
14952.0,Patient,yeah I think generally that that'll be a good idea at least employee get a job.
705.0,Provider,"And then, once you know when you get a job and we need to work around that and we can do that. yeah so I have you down, then for October the eight that's going to be a 5pm. If you meet me at 5am I will not be there. Sorry, what I just not an early riser not that early. Neither okay all in you and I will work well together, no, no."
14952.0,Patient,No way. Show just do five o'clock on the 13th them to just to keep it consistent.
705.0,Provider,"Let me see again on the third king. I just want to make sure that that was the time that was available to. Yes, if five o'clock is best for you and you want to keep it at that time I could do that again on the."
14952.0,Patient,13th let's do it.
705.0,Provider,"are going to do that at 5pm on the 13th so i'm going to go ahead and bring up the calendar here. And it just takes one second to load again. Okay, each time I do a day to just take so little bit of time."
14952.0,Patient,yeah i'm sure.
705.0,Provider,"And this is the 13th we're looking at now again 5pm. I booked for usually an hour. Okay, and if you find that you know some days you may have a lot to talk about some days you don't or you have other things, you need to do. communicate that with me a lot of times, even though we set up 60 minutes you might be like you know what Valerie just want to check in. Maybe it's for accountability you check in and then you're like Okay, I have X y&z to go to do i'm going and that's great we're other days, maybe you're like you know what a really want to explore this and talk about this a little bit more."

I appreciate that a lot, and it was really good to talk to you very nice to meet you. Likewise, and i'm encouraged to get to know you a little bit better and to work with you and. i'm just happy that that I think we're a match, because you know, I was obviously a little nervous about that so."
705.0,Provider,that's normal he didn't know me or anything you're like what.
14952.0,Patient,I really didn't and honestly I didn't even do any research so um. It was a total roll the dice and I think it worked out okay.
705.0,Provider,"Good you took a healthy risk. Thanks yeah if ever there comes a time to Craig where you feel like that, for whatever reason it's not a matter you just feel like that you want to try something else, this is about you it's not about me. i'm here to support you, and when you feel like that maybe it's run its course and you want to do something else communicate and we have other you know there's other avenues, sometimes even in groups.
