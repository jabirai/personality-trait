706.0,Provider,hey. Can you hear me.
3975.0,Patient,Can you hear me.
706.0,Provider,yep I can hear you can you hear.
3975.0,Patient,me. There we go for some reason. Your calls doesn't turn the audio on automatically i'm not sure why so every time I have to turn it on.
706.0,Provider,Oh that's weird I know.
3975.0,Patient,"Sorry, I do not come most carefully upon my hour, we had the window screen guy here so."
706.0,Provider,Okay. So let's now.
3975.0,Patient,uh we had the window screen guy here.
706.0,Provider,yeah so you had some screens replaced.
3975.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we had never replaced the screens in 20 years, so he is replaced and then he was just back because we have a covered every way with these fake window things in it that hummingbirds kept getting up and then they would get inside and you know think they could go out and."
706.0,Provider,I don't know.
3975.0,Patient,"and eventually die, we had like three dead hummingbirds in there and. He couldn't get out so we put my wife wanted to put screens up so that. They couldn't get into the windows. So hopefully we won't have any more did hummingbirds."
706.0,Provider,"yeah hopefully going to get their screens replaced here to I haven't done anything with them, since the trade show head and they're pretty bad I should probably replace them all."
3975.0,Patient,So how's it away.
706.0,Provider,"You know it's actually pretty nice today it's probably like upper 70s, lower eds blue skies pretty Nice."
3975.0,Patient,"Nice yeah it's it has been hot here like Labor day was we went to a. In law's Barbecue thing, and it was 103. yeah murkiness with the scenic view of the oil refineries."
706.0,Provider,"Pretty hot here to that weekend um but it just yeah. it's just the weather here and I was just so weird because, like last night, it was in the 50s at night, you know, and then the in this morning, then it was humid again it was warm and it just goes kind of all over the place."
3975.0,Patient,"well. But what else is new we've been doing a bunch of stuff. we're getting more solar panels, we already have solar. it's a. You know it's not the kind of thing where you're if everybody else's power goes out your you still have power."
706.0,Provider,Because I thought it was because it collects the solar energy.
3975.0,Patient,"Only if you have a battery so basically you collect the though the setup we have now is you collecting energy and then any excess energy that you use while you're collecting it you draw from the grid, and if you. aren't using enough your meter actually runs backwards and you feed the grid. Oh, so, but if the power goes out. Your power goes out because you're hooked into the grid."
706.0,Provider,APP so. At not how I thought it worked.
3975.0,Patient,"Well, so what we're doing is getting a battery backup battery in addition to eat more panels. And then, in fact, when the power goes out, we will have eight circuits of power for the duration of the battery."
706.0,Provider,How long the batteries typically use last four.
3975.0,Patient,"i'm not sure of the lifespan i'm. Normally a well you know, like normally the power if it goes out if we have a brownout. we're actually not affected because we're on the same circuit if it's a planned outage we're normally not affected because we're on the same circuit there's the fire station."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3975.0,Patient,"So that we don't lose our power in that case, but if it's something else happens and the power goes out for everybody and it's not a planned outage then we do in fact get affected. So it was out for like two or three days or something last year we you know we because we got all these fires and everything. i'm not actually sure how long the duration of the lifespan of the battery is to be honest. yeah but."
706.0,Provider,"I know the big thing here is we get generators and then. We use generators, especially after last year we had the dre chow I mean some people I was out for eight days, but some people were out for weeks. And people weren't getting generators, so that they can."
3975.0,Patient,Have a we have a small one. But you know that's if we can avoid using it then that's good too.
706.0,Provider,"Well yeah, especially if you can't find gas, because that was the big thing here is we, none of the gas stations were open because there's no power right."
3975.0,Patient,You can't pump gas because there's no power.
706.0,Provider,"Exactly there's no power so then people were driving like an hour away to get gas, well then, they were having a shortage of gas because too many people were coming besides their local area, the gas, and you can find ice because. Like I said I mean it was just mass I don't ever want to experience that again now, I know how people that are in like hurricane States when hurricanes happen because it's it's exactly like that, just like a panic."
3975.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah so we, we only get like eight circuits, but you figure, you know we figure as long as we can run like the freezer so that we don't lose 100 and something or you know hundreds of dollars worth of. stuff in the freezer. And refrigerator and charge your phones or whatever, then."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
3975.0,Patient,that's that's enough so.
706.0,Provider,"yeah that's pretty good maybe a fan or two if it yeah. Well that's good, though I mean it's always good to hope for the best prepare for the worst."
3975.0,Patient,You know yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,No anymore.
3975.0,Patient,"Man i'm not sure that seems like each day there's been some arduous and difficult task that's, which is a movie reference, by the way, i'm."
706.0,Provider,wasn't me that.
3975.0,Patient,"Real Grande a jar john Wayne Maureen o'hara directed by john Ford. john john Ford did what's called the cavalry trilogy which are three movies, about the you know the cavalry. Which don't have the same characters in them, but they have people playing the same role basically. If that makes sense, so like James Jones road from here to eternity and then he wrote the thing revive and then he wrote whistle and. The same characters are in each book, but with different names. Like playing the same role. And it's the same with the cavalry movies so there's board Fort Apache she worried yellow ribbon and real grunting."
706.0,Provider,And that goes either way that my dad has because he's kind of into that like kind of.
3975.0,Patient,"i'm real grown day has or it's just john Wayne is trying to get rid of a bunch of officers who were hanging around Moreno hero who's his wife. and So he says, since we're doing all this i'm sure you have many arduous and difficult tasks to perform. You from them, which i've always thought is a great way to get rid of people, you know. So. Anyway, um yeah it's it seemed like every day there's kind of something that we end up doing that. You know, like. Having the people come to sign the contract for the additional panels and and and the generator or the the battery and stuff so it's nothing that's really hard you know people are coming to the House and you just signing some papers, although it took forever, but. So, every day, it seems like there has been something like that so."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
3975.0,Patient,But it's it's good to be getting stuff done.
706.0,Provider,"Oh yeah if you have that feeling of you know, success and accomplishing something."
3975.0,Patient,"yeah even if it's not exactly you don't wake up in the morning and go oh hi I get to go to the bank today and close out the nonprofit's bank account, and some. whoo."
706.0,Provider,yeah not a huge celebration.
3975.0,Patient,"No, no, but at least. At least, as you say you're getting stuff done."
706.0,Provider,"Exactly and it's a feeling of accomplishment you know there's some days. You have to take the small victories, because you might not get a big one, so take the small ones. Are you okay."
3975.0,Patient,"Well that's why I do the rule of six with you know. Even if they're not hugely important things if you get your six things accomplished That in itself is an accomplishment. yeah, although I guess it doesn't qualify for the list."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean I don't know there's some days I make a list and I get nothing done on it, and I feel like I was busy all day but I didn't get anything on my lesson. And somehow you're less accomplished."
3975.0,Patient,"The key is being realistic about the list, and that was one of the first things that the guy talked about when he talked about the whole concept of the rule of six or the rule of five or whatever was. You know everybody's done this right it's Friday or Saturday morning and you get up and you know, while the weekend, and we have this stuff to do so, you make a list of things you're going to do on the weekend and it's like an eight and a half by 11 sheet."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3975.0,Patient,"Right and nobody in their right mind thinks you're going to get everything done so you're setting yourself up for failure because you get like just. Best and then you feel bad because you didn't. You feel like you didn't get anything done when in fact you got two things done, you know so so the key is being realistic about the list and spacing things out and. putting things on there that you know you can accomplish have varying degrees of difficulty."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm definitely, so I would agree with that, so what has been your tasks this week that you've had to accomplish do you said you signed contracts and. gotta get out your handy dandy but."
3975.0,Patient,Again gotta get out the thing and see. I still have walking and I did walk once not three times.
706.0,Provider,Once is better than none.
3975.0,Patient,that's true when those screens paid the pg&e bill. did some laundry we went to a movie.
706.0,Provider,How would you see.
3975.0,Patient,um the 10 rings Shan Shan Shan JI in the 10 rings. marvel movie.
706.0,Provider,I don't know that one.
3975.0,Patient,"I was pretty good. It was, I mean it's another marvel universe movie. But it's. it's actually a lot like did you see say crouching tiger hidden. So, Michelle yeoh is in it, but she's not the main the main store. um but the a lot of times they're speaking in Chinese and it's a bunch of it is late in China. So there are subtitles and stuff it's pretty good."
706.0,Provider,"movie in a long time, but our theaters were closed here for. A really long time to."
3975.0,Patient,"yeah ours were close to but they're open again so we've seen, I think I said we saw the green night."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
3975.0,Patient,uh oh i'm jungle cruise.
706.0,Provider,how's that.
3975.0,Patient,Oh it's it's fun it's silly.
706.0,Provider,yeah maybe.
3975.0,Patient,"yeah well yeah it's kind of a kids movie uh. But you know, like my wife got to watch the rock and I got to watch Emily blunt and so we're."
706.0,Provider,Happy there you go so good compromise and.
3975.0,Patient,"Actually I shouldn't say the rock dwayne Johnson. The Rockies with dwayne Johnson uh I actually admire him, he has done a really good job at. going from you know being like a pro wrestler whatever to to. Creating a career. and any I don't will be was it wow it was. Turning to the Center of the earth. Oh, it was a Jules verne oh mysterious island."
706.0,Provider,which was the. g and I thought he was really good in jumanji.
3975.0,Patient,"yeah um but in in mysterious island, which was the sequel to journey to the Center of the earth, he played he so he's this huge guy right and he there's a scene, where he ends up playing. A ukulele and singing. louie Armstrong song. What a wonderful world. and Actually. A really need scene and. And buddy. built like him who can be in a movie and play the ukulele and carry off playing the ukulele and singing What a wonderful world. It was like thumbs up for me, I mean it would have been so easy for that to just be totally stupid. You know, and you, I mean even just hearing about you kind of go oh God, you know it's actually a really need seat."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well, if you think about it, though I mean wrestling is is acting so I mean he already had the acting and him he just had to kind of transfer it over to you know different areas more serious. backup theatrical, but I am now I think he's uh he's he does pretty well for himself as far as yeah."
3975.0,Patient,"We did like snitch a lot I don't know if you saw that one that was really good anyway Oh, we had my son, we were working on the pantry."
706.0,Provider,Oh no.
3975.0,Patient,"I paid rice got new context, so I had to pay for them and then submit the bill see this is the kind of thing that you, you know you can accomplish so it becomes an item that."
706.0,Provider,that's what I need to do is make all of my items I want to accomplish things that I. Already do like because I have to do them and then. I will get it oh uh.
3975.0,Patient,"huh well that's actually part of it, I mean it's doing laundry you know I have laundry on the list."
706.0,Provider,"Because it's something that you got to do well it's something you have to do and it's something that you can look down at, and you know check off your list. I think that's a great and it's a great idea and that's what I tell typically what I you know, encourage people to do is come up with a consistent, you know schedule that structured. Throughout the day and basically list out, you know, like this is the time I get up and these are the things I do, and this is my routine. Especially people early in recovery, because that gets them through the day and once you get to the end of the day, that's one more day under your belt that you're in recovery and you move on to the next day. So typically that's what that's what I tell people to do but i've never really thought about it as if you make a list of things you know you have to do you're always going to show accomplishment that day. that's another way to look at it that's really positive."
3975.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Oh one dog better another dog, so we spent time going to the vet."
706.0,Provider,ooh must have been sipping a pretty nasty by.
3975.0,Patient,Four stitches.
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
3975.0,Patient,"henry's blind and up. never wants to play except everyone, so I when she wakes up in the morning huh and so he was asleep still and she decided, she was in a playful mood and she was wagging their parts in his face and and then she did the bow thing. Where they're. showing that they're playing, but of course he's blind. And then she was racing around then and she jumped on him to play, and of course he's half asleep so. We got to go to the vet and spend 1200 dollars."
706.0,Provider,Oh happy a pet insurance.
3975.0,Patient,"that's mostly it. I mean i'm going today to. Oh, we had to cancel the credit card so that my wife could find hers literally five minutes after we canceled it, but now we don't have a credit card and we're still waiting for the new one."
706.0,Provider,Oh no.
3975.0,Patient,"And like I said, I have to go to the bank after this call and close out a nonprofit account and send the content to the nonprofit."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm so but a good way to look at it is look at all of the the trials and tribulations that you're having throughout your week they're they're pretty small compared to what they could be you know. So it's it's nice to almost have that boring life, you know of just that monotony of doing the things you have to do every day. it's kind of Nice. there's a lot of people. That would trade places with you in a heartbeat."
3975.0,Patient,"As as opposed to getting up and going to your chemo appointment, or something like that which."
706.0,Provider,"are getting up in the first thing you think about when you get up is how am I going to get high today where, am I going to go, who do I have to rob what do I have to find you know. Or you know how am I going to feed my family today or you know just like just all of those really kind of extreme circumstances well with trade them for a mundane life even think that, like a mundane life is just yeah whatever its life, but some people would trade and heartbeat."
3975.0,Patient,Oh true.
706.0,Provider,So how is everything going with your wife is she doing well.
3975.0,Patient,"yeah she has not been writing her exercise but uncle for the past few days. which she admits is you know. I was gonna write it and I didn't know you know I gotta I gotta write it to her all fall out of the habit everything um. But she's doing pretty well she's had a few appointments and today is the day that she was hoping to not have to leave home. And she's working on revamping the Monday life. The the kitchen cupboard but redoing the pantry led to redoing the kitchen covered with all the spices in it, because she's got these things with drawers that come out and. You know you set things up and everything is cool and then a year later it's all degraded into this massive mess and. Then you have to redo it so she's redoing it. and We weren't going to go for a walk on Sunday, but then it was too hot, by the time we got out there."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
3975.0,Patient,too hot for her anyway.
706.0,Provider,"When you want to be careful, so if it's really hot and you're out doing physical activity you don't hydrate enough or whatever, I mean heatstroke there's all kinds of things that can happen yeah."
3975.0,Patient,So that's that's doing well. paying bills.
706.0,Provider,"Always fun. um how are you doing, how do you feel like you're doing."
3975.0,Patient,"i'm I think i'm doing pretty well um. I had a there were a couple of things that work, which was always my you know, has been my big stressor. That happened this week that are kind of like Oh, you know the kind of thing that would normally have prayed on my mind and and stuff like that, but it's not too bad so."
706.0,Provider,"So it wasn't something that, like in the past, it would have triggered you to possibly drink or something like that, and then it hit us hard, this time yeah that's good I mean that shows progress in recovery."
3975.0,Patient,yeah I.
706.0,Provider,mean that shows that you're starting to change the way that you think and you're like well it's not that bad.
3975.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"So um. So did you was the case manager and you ever get a chance to talk and kind of figure out somebody locally, that you could also see."
3975.0,Patient,"Oh yes, I did get a list, and I call that I haven't had a chance to do anything with it because it's not on my list."
706.0,Provider,For next week.
3975.0,Patient,"I will write it down right now. it's actually the first thing on my list I just wrote it down on today first thing because I haven't had time to make my list for today, I think, in theory, are supposed to make it the night before, but I."
706.0,Provider,"But I mean also now it's today, and you know what you've done so far, so you can make your list and check it off and say okay well that's that's done."
3975.0,Patient,"That sounds cheesy, but in fact i've i've done that you know. deliberately think of something that's really easy that you've already done, to put it on the list, so you can mark it off it's already being done."
706.0,Provider,yeah marketing it feels good.
3975.0,Patient,uh huh yeah.
706.0,Provider,"it's a sense of accomplishment so um when you seem you seem like you're doing well, you seem like you've got a good mindset. You know you're just doing doing your daily routines, which is what life is kind of a daily routine um you know working and spending time with your wife and making sure that you're healthy. You know, those are just you know all important things, so I mean I definitely think that like I said you're you're thinking patterns have changed they're not eschewed as they used to be, because it would have been stressful things would have caused you to go to unhealthy habits, where."
3975.0,Patient,it's not.
706.0,Provider,Good did you do in replay sense like you were stressed at work and then how did you relieve that stress.
3975.0,Patient,You mean currently or before.
706.0,Provider,"Currently, so before you said that that would have triggered you to start drinking."
3975.0,Patient,"yeah it i'm. Basically, just trying to de stress the thing like. You know, saying it's not that big a deal or you know we'll figure out some solution or you know worrying about this won't solve it."
706.0,Provider,Okay somewhere so processing through it. knowing what you can control and what you can't control and kind of going through that solution based process.
3975.0,Patient,"sounds good, to me, definitely if it works."
706.0,Provider,"yeah if it works for you, I mean you know, some people go for a run some people go shopping, which can be healthy and unhealthy, you know people talk to their friends, some people, you know do unhealthy things like over eat or over drinker you know over anything. You know, and it just you have to find what works for you. and know that that's that that go to coping skill that you can use when things feel a little chaotic mm hmm."
3975.0,Patient,"So yeah it's and the job is going pretty well. we're getting up to review time now which. is always you know if you've worked in a big corporation, and you know it's just it's a pain in the ass. And you have to you're you know you're always supposed to have had this plan for the entire year of all this, nobody nobody ever does that, in my experience."
706.0,Provider,"No, no, and it's always that what do you want to work on for the next year and then you come up with them and then the next year rolls around and you're like I really didn't do any of these things."
3975.0,Patient,What where did I put that list.
706.0,Provider,"Actually, so it's yeah I definitely think that whole review thing needs to be revamped bad I mean and that way for so long."
3975.0,Patient,"So, and I mentioned it, you know to my boss, I was like hey it's review time and his response was irk or something like that you know. Because. it's more work for him. Because he has to. You know, yes. You all of his people. Get reviewed so."
706.0,Provider,"we'll see and that's the thing So when I was a director and I was a director over at some point supported employment program That was the thing like I have all these employees that I have to do reviews on and yeah it's stressful. You know it's you try and you know you have to be non biased and you have to you know just look at the thing look at it, with all the facts and play."
3975.0,Patient,Books I lost your audio. How about now. yeah. I lost your audio.
706.0,Provider,I know I last yours to for just a minute.
3975.0,Patient,You were talking about. Being impartial and stuff that you had to do for.
706.0,Provider,"Oh yeah you know just being impartial and then being able to constructively criticize your employees, so that they do better, while being supportive and hopefully not too negative, so that they, you know become unmotivated you know it's. As a supervisor or boss or Director it's difficult to know how to relate information that needs to be improved without sounding like you're putting somebody down or you know, like and you want to motivate them rather than D motivate them so. um yeah I definitely have spent my time in that kind of a position, and especially when you've got employees that are lacking in many areas it's very challenging to put a positive spin."
3975.0,Patient,"we've got a friend who works at wells fargo and she manages a group it's not super big. And wells fargo's you know they're having lots of trouble anyway, the legal issues and stuff and. It sounds like the corporate atmosphere is terrible. For employees just working there is no fun and then she constantly has all these stories like Oh, you know, on this one guy finally just up and quit and I was thinking, thank God. I you know i'm not supposed to say that, but he was just this Royal pain in the ass to. deal with and manage effectively and. So the fact that he quit on his own was like."
706.0,Provider,huh.
3975.0,Patient,Thank goodness.
706.0,Provider,"yeah no and i've definitely been in that position as well, so. I don't know it's hard when you're when you're over a lot of people, I mean you're responsible for your behavior and all of there's like it's like having a bunch of kids. You know that's how that's how I explain it because i'm responsible for anything my children do. You know, it comes back on me, because there are minor, and I feel the same way when you know your overtop of people at work, ultimately, if they screw up that comes back on you, is why weren't you making sure they didn't. mm hmm so yeah so i'm not a supervisor of anybody anymore, so I like it. Congratulations, I know. i'm all right well um I think we only had you on today for a half hour. Okay, unless, and if you want to make your sessions for an hour when you make the session appointment just tell them you want to make it."
3975.0,Patient,"And then, in fact, I have to my wife has having cataract surgery next week so. If. It conflicts with our next appointment, which. was two weeks from today."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
3975.0,Patient,"So can I reschedule that with you or do I can go back to the thing as well, anyway."
706.0,Provider,"Do you already have it scheduled, I believe we do I think we're on the 30th that one."
3975.0,Patient,yeah oh it. Is there.
706.0,Provider,it's one o'clock my time so that would be 11am your time.
3975.0,Patient,"Right, which is actually in the middle of her. teacher."
706.0,Provider,"Do you want to, we can reschedule it now, or you can go back to the virtual clinic and try scheduling it with them it's entirely up to."
3975.0,Patient,"Oh, if we can reschedule it now, that would be."
706.0,Provider,"Great so let's go ahead. let's take you off. On this one, do you want it, that same day, or do you want to do a different day."
3975.0,Patient,"The same day would have would be good, except, it would have to be a lot later I mean later, which would be a lot later your time, probably, so I don't know how let you go."
706.0,Provider,um I typically work three top 345 my time.
3975.0,Patient,yeah it's that probably won't work then.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to do. Like. Your."
3975.0,Patient,"First, right in the first."
706.0,Provider,We could do Wednesday the 29th.
3975.0,Patient,"Wednesday the 29th might work, let me shift machine is turn off Friday Friday, the first would be safest."
706.0,Provider,"just want to make sure I don't double booked myself, sometimes I do that, and then they get mad at me. yeah there's nothing worse than when I book an appointment and a book an appointment and then."
3975.0,Patient,At the same time.
706.0,Provider,"Then I came out. So I like to double check and make sure that they haven't booked me for anything yet. that's the only that's the one downfall about not making your own appointments is that you don't know what's already out there. See the first is on Friday, and it is completely clear so. Friday, the first."
3975.0,Patient,Like 11 would be good if that'll work.
706.0,Provider,So 11 o'clock your time one o'clock my time.
3975.0,Patient,yeah alright perfect.
706.0,Provider,So we'll just move you over.
3975.0,Patient,cool Thank you.
706.0,Provider,What 30 minutes or an hour.
3975.0,Patient,or 30 minutes is probably good okay. Okay.
706.0,Provider,"All right, I will get that on the permanent calendar and we will see you here in a couple weeks."
3975.0,Patient,Okay Thank you so much.
706.0,Provider,"All right, take care."
3975.0,Patient,Okay bye.
