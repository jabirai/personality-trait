7154.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, take care Robin. lovely hi. i'm so for transcription I don't know if you guys can update her care intensity. or I don't know, I guess, well, I guess i'll just do it. Okay, so for robin's next. appointment with me. i'm gonna put her on Friday march 18th. At one. Two o'clock central time. 3pm Pacific. Okay, let me take a look here at robins care intensity. And yeah Dr Steve and I had discussed that that Robin needs to you know she's she's made as much progress as she's going to make. As far as her chemical dependency issues and and really it's just all of her physical health issues, but as far as her substance use disorder. We kind of address that as much as we can so. Okay, so she's on twice a month for. Medical appointment and group appointments already quarterly for individual so looks like she's already on that and so i'm just going to go ahead and. Like mark already did that she is on a twice a month group schedule so we'll see her on. February 1 and then on February 15. And it she just needs to get up and get out of bed so. She was agreeable to doing that I would really like to just see her out of that bedroom. But as far as robbins other treatment goals, she is going to be in go. weekly so as far as like her overall goal was. To get up out of this bed, and so she does go to Bingo every Friday night. And socialize with the Ladies in her apartment complex and then she does another game night with the ladies so she goes twice a week to some sort of. activity in her apartment complex. robins other treatment goal. is just. yeah. Not not getting any sicker. we've discussed the covert vaccine many times and she is completely resistant to. The covert vaccines or or a flu vaccine but she's been sick with multiple viral illnesses just almost once a month, it seems like. And then she she mentioned all of the symptoms, that seems like she might have coven, and so we just kind of discussed a care plan for her as far as not impacting anyone else, and so, she was you know amenable to that, and in saying that you know she wasn't going to go to being go. and risk impacting anybody, and she said, especially some of the ladies are older. So that's good she said, we at least willing to do that and. You know she doesn't wear a mask or anything like that she hardly leaves the House but. yeah I mean she's definitely at risk for severe complications, so we talked about just kind of what. What to look out for. If she gets worse. But yeah really all she can do is treat her symptoms at home and. But I don't know what Robin oh she's always sick she's always the sick. But we will see her this coming Tuesday and hopefully she'll be feeling better by this Tuesday. And then hopefully she can be up in about an a little bit more participatory in group. So that's an update for Robin bartlett's. Treatment plan and looks like her care intensity was already updated. In her scheduling was already updated so. she's compliant with everything with all of her, I was looking just now at her surveys. or drug screen yeah she's been completely in the green on everything so. not know why it still says oh suicide risk I think i'm going to update that she hasn't had any recent suicidal ideation. So if you can add that into she she denies any recent suicidal ideation."
