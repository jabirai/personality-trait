So I was up at five you know, I was taking care of her so i'm like okay i'm gonna be up I go ahead, I turned off my alarm because i'm going to be up and I sat down and ended up falling asleep and I woke up like.

12465.0,Patient,"Oh no i'm not hearing you anymore. I can't hear you okay. I think I can hear there it is, I can hear you now oh right. yeah terrible twos and then you went silent."
540.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I love it he absolutely like anytime he's in the room who's like a tornado now. So you know. He does not leave anything just unchecked, so he just. He goes at it."
12465.0,Patient,"It keeps you going, yes, I said, I think, to a cousin my cousin yesterday I said really what i'm doing is it's like having a newborn again. that's what it reminds me of you know, going in when these when I see that she's agitated okay so i'm checking her brief, are you hungry, are you this granny, what do you need and you're trying to figure out what's making. You know, like an infant what's making you uncomfortable so I can make you comfortable again. But since that she has declined very quickly. And you know with hospice they have something called respite care where people like myself who was the sole caregiver who don't have you know, a spouse or anybody else who is assisting with health where. The patient can actually go to a facility and we're with arbor hospice and they have their own facility will be the same nurses and caregivers the same plan, you know how you switch different facilities, you know they try to change things up and not comfortable so. um that she's gonna try to get up on me again. and They have some time it goes pretty quickly, because they have one room available, but they do try to again help people like myself first. So they have some time available, between the. So I did reserve it but as quickly as she's declining. I might not need it because, if I let her go what I don't want to do is you know she's. Declining again this fast this rapidly I don't want her to pass away there rather her be home, you know where everyone is around so but I reserved it just in case you know Mike up to a point where she kind of just holds you know I just don't know so I just reserved, just in case. so that I could try to get some sleep, because not having any rem sleep, you know for weeks on end is is taking a toll on me and you know I have trouble just forming sentences as. Tired. But she has declined so quickly now that she just she mumbles she doesn't recognize anyone but me. Oh her kids really don't like that. She just. She cannot help me any longer to transfer her so it's just betting let's okay it's that that um and she can't even wait long enough for me to get to the bedpan up so. I was so exhausted Sunday morning, this was the big thing for me that i'm dealing with my guilt and so forth. again. I ended up about last time I looked at the clock, it was like 520 something and i'm fighting to stay awake because I know she's going to start fussing soon, because it's about the time that our medicine starts wearing off and. She started, you know she starts her day. And I ended up I I sat down I stood up and I ended up falling asleep and I realized too because normally my dog lets me know my daughter my dog was sleeping at the time, like she was her head was over the couch and she was somewhat snoring so I know she was exhausted. But I ended up falling asleep and I heard. And I jumped up I fell asleep and I ran into the bedroom and I look in there and I I can't find my grandmother I am freaking out and it's because i'm still groggy and i'm looking around and she's on the floor. And I said great. And she's sleeping against what happened is she obviously tried to get out of bed, and this is the day that I learned she no longer can move on our own or wait bear at all, she tried to get out of it, because I believe she tried to use the bathroom and. i've got to tell you what happened before then, but anyway i'll tell you have to but. there's an intangible that I keep right next to her bed that I keep the path of the pampers the briefs and the wife said, you know things like that on. And she was laying against it, it was tipped back against the wall, which is what the big boom that I heard and she was sleeping on it, it took it. Like just that quickly she tried to get up and must have fell asleep or just realize. and feel back so immediately I start examining her checking her head or anything and she's like what's wrong what's wrong but she's mumbling what's wrong what's wrong. i'm like any you fell, do you know you feel, are you hurting she says no, I said honey you fell you fell I need to check your back in your head she's like in. The first thing she keeps saying I am my head I didn't hit my head, because she knows, she has her head she's gone to the hospital she hates that little. And i'm somewhat typical because she's making sure I know that she hit her head, but she doesn't realize what just happened in what could have happened she could have broken our hip. I mean i'm checking her hips everything make sure everything's in line feeling up and down it back to this, no, no, no, but I also know with dementia patients they don't really process pain, the same way, so i'm doing all the double checking and she's got her brief like partway down her. Her thigh and I realized that I realized, she was trying to get up to use the bathroom she used to urinated on the floor. And she was just laying there sleeping had no idea was just that quick oh my God so i'm dealing with the guilt of that so I got her up. put her on the bed pan and I noticed she couldn't use that's when I realized. She couldn't wait bear at all, she couldn't help me like she used to I had to do everything lifted her up so while she's on there just doing the head to toe still just going over her back you know any this, no, no, no, and she's still falling asleep. So i'm hospice had given me, so I gave me her her medicine pack already so I. Just knew, she was going to be in pain, if I later down without a name, so I gave her some pain medicine, I was like i'm gonna give you some pain medicine, just in case you start hurting she said Okay, so I gave it with her breakfast sees me. know just having oatmeal before you call him she never complained I just kept it up, I gave it to her every four hours, and she never complained of pain, even to this day she doesn't remember and so that was day the day that I realized, we are going down because. She can no longer get out of bed on her own and. When she's fussing and you know moving around in bed or trying to throw her legs over the bed, to get out I just get up and I run in there granny, what do you need what, how do you feel you got to use the bathroom and you want something to eat I know she wants and it's something so. The last couple of days of really just been that of course I contacted the nurse that we work with in our hospital let her know about the fall and so she came out yesterday and check the Rover and she was like you are absolutely right, she has the client even from just last week. I just she's going pretty quickly, and you know she did a once over honor as well, and you know checking her out and they they brought it sent a doctor with her as well and. my grandmother at the time they were here they wanted to use the restroom so they helped me put her on the. Because I just wanted to get a feel for how she's doing but anyway, with all that being said, she's."
540.0,Provider,"Like honey, I mean it's kind of Nice that she had to go to the bathroom while they're there because a lot of times being able to see, like those moments are like those trace markers for how somebody is doing."
12465.0,Patient,"Exactly and that's what she's able to see that was exactly my point absolutely, thank you for understanding that because it took me forever to try to get it out so. mom. Following yes, she says well i'm going to increase my visits i'm going to start calling you every day as it's going quicker and. see what you need income and check her out more often, and I can come by and easier for you so that you can get maybe an hour rest or something. Because you know she can only stay for an hour to so you can kind of get an hour rest and i'll sit with your grandmother for you, so I started i'm started calling around and starting her her end of life, services and stuff like call. get some information heading my way to to get her paid and taken care of so when everything does happen, I can make that phone call they can come and get her do her cremation you know everything will already in place, so I won't have to think at that time."
540.0,Provider,"yeah it's definitely though you're so stressed and it's all so stressful it's going to be important for you to do it now, so that you don't. At that moment, you can just now, like taken those moments, because even go go go so that's the moments that you're gonna you're really want to be able to take it all into and start processing."
12465.0,Patient,"Yes, I have a feeling, you know because everybody i'll be calling when you know when she gets to that point which she's she's pretty close now because. She also which I also feel to miss, and she stopped eating. It she's retiring. i'm sorry."
540.0,Provider,When did you stop eating.
12465.0,Patient,"um yes, two days ago, two days ago to think of what you wanting it so this would be the third morning she doesn't eat she the first day, which would be the same day Sunday yeah Tuesday so Sunday she had a couple of bites of eggs for me like three or four Bytes eight and. The two bites of toast normally I consider up in and she'll eat all her oatmeal and she loves her coffee still and she just was like I don't want it, I don't want it. But she will take sips just don't take some sips of water and some sets of coffee. that's it yesterday, I tried to. Just offer I made her some oatmeal yesterday, and she took one bite, and she and it was it was me just kind of saying here take this granny take this and she put it in her mouth and. She kind of played with it in our mouth for a while just that one fight so she did not want it, so I had to you know give her some water to help us swallow it and. Also, when the nurse was here yesterday her name is Sarah when she was here she also knows. When I when she used to help me with her using bathroom that I also noticed that her urine is also darker now so retaining water, so it appears that our systems are just slowly shutting down so i'm curious this morning, to see if she had an appetite for me, maybe. i'm not get my hopes up, but it is there. Saturday. Saturday, I believe, yes, I believe it was Saturday now Saturday morning before the Sunday is today Saturday morning. She. took off her brief full of feces Oh, she done yes and everywhere, it was you could tell everywhere, she tried to make it in the bedroom I mean it was like a kid with. It was all it was so overwhelming because you know, without the sleep it's like. It with my OCD I just seen just germs everywhere, like so force and she's she's like what's wrong and she's laying and feces everywhere and i'm looking around the room and i'm like well, if you so just quickly from Saturday to Sunday. She went from. i'm trying to get around the room and she must see to. You can see what she was just trying to get two things touch things close to the Roman and again it was it was between 530 and 630 in the morning, where I had fallen asleep. It like I was able to do laundry are nice I try to keep myself active and doing something to try to stay because, if I sit here on this couch too long i'll fall asleep. You know, and I just I was in I just happened, I was like I gotta sit down by just just pounding i'm tired of it down for a minute I won't lay down, but what ended up happening with how I caught, it is again um. Something I saw something in me when I was sleep was like you too comfortable something's not right, so I jump up like. And I realized, I was laying down on the couch so I got myself comfortable like within like 30 minutes to 45 minutes, I was like oh my gosh I got too comfortable I really felt like I was about to build asleep here, so my body like a wake up and then that's when I ran in there and I noticed. All of this stuff now when I woke up and jumped up at that time in looked in her bedroom I could see that she was still in the bed, but something was on the floor. which happened to be her bri sounds like quite a bit and that's when I got up and went in there and realize what. So and she's playing with these spaces around her and she's like I like rainy are you okay you got to use the bathroom and she's looking at me like. What is wrong with us, you have feces everywhere, she starts looking at or such as like I don't see it, she doesn't see it all over her body or anything she doesn't feel it she doesn't feel it in the bed. So I immediately start washing her up and stuff so I have been totally consumed by you know again how fast she's progressing and all of her boxes are still display around in my house from. Since I last talked to you, I had to move her out of her apartment before the end of September, and I had to do that on my own me just me just not two men and a truck, but it was a lady energy, so I keep you know just making. TRIPS back and forth so everything is everywhere and I haven't had time because I can't keep my eyes off of her for too long. And that was another reason why I was going to do the respite when I first acquired about it, I was like well if they take her for the five days they picked her up they bring her back it's the same team that works with her. You know she gets her own bed with her own TV, just like she has in her room now like I have it set up now, so I felt comfortable enough to let her do that. And the social worker that works with the hospice said, you know you don't have to let her go the whole five days if it makes you comfortable, but at least to get you a couple nights of sleep. So you know, I was looking forward to Okay, I get that rest and organize my home a little bit when she comes home i'll be a better me for her and. Then again, as i've repeated you know all of these changes, just now, I question if now's a good time because I don't want to have her go there in she passed away i'm i'm really i'd be really surprised if she makes it in this light."
540.0,Provider,"yeah and that's why it's so it's so hard at the end because I mean like you have seen, like you've said right now, like. So, like with my mom like when she was passing away she's."
12465.0,Patient,I don't know what happened. yep I hear you. know if it's something if this is like when you move your hair something happens with. It okay here here.
540.0,Provider,"It could be will know it's something to do with my signal, I think."
12465.0,Patient,Oh gosh.
540.0,Provider,"Like it like I see you, but then it's just like quiet and i'm like okay I don't think you can hear me so, then I asked and you're like no. i'm yeah it's I mean it's crazy how different, it is for every single person like like my mom like she like she ended up doing like the decline, but it's very, very slow and then she had like that burst of energy like they say. So then she had. That day a burst of energy and then it was like quiet for two weeks. So that's yeah that's when she was just like in like the bed, and she was just like the like, then the rattling came, I think it was like the last week yeah so the last like four days, she had like that rattle in her. voice."
12465.0,Patient,Yet.
540.0,Provider,"She couldn't I mean she wasn't. She was like blinking her eyes, you can tell like when she like felt people in the room, sometimes. See Baba says she couldn't talk or anything so like the last week and a half i'd say she just was like it was just like blank for her, I guess, if that makes sense."
12465.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely."
540.0,Provider,"But then there's other people that they that they have like the fast decline and then that's it and then some people just will decide to go, I mean in the nursing is I saw some people, they were like good good good. And then there one family member kane that they hadn't seen in forever and then 30 minutes later, they just they find that piece, and then they go."
12465.0,Patient,"yeah yeah you just don't know so i'm. Like I don't know we'll see what it looks like on the 19th if she is still here, you know, but I did it just in case. i'm my mother came and stayed the night, so that I could go run some errands yesterday go pay rent and get all the things that some most of the things I tried to get done xhosa it was two hours in I get a phone call i'm standing in line at croker's at this time and. Just at the service desk and I say hello and she's like she's yelling through the phone so everybody in like in here. I can't take it anymore. And I was, like everybody just looking at me i'm looking like. I can hear now and then I hear my grandmother and I hear my mother's day to my grandmother at that point i'm not letting you out of bed, please stop fighting you mean mom and I hear my grandmother, you know mumble in her voice get it from in front getting get from in front of the bit. and It was probably the clearest i've heard her be in the last couple of days, so I was like okay she's in her fighting mode right. Like yeah good here now I can't take it anymore I don't know how you do this. I don't know how you do this, she kicked me in my back. My bag, you can got a couple i'm so sorry honey, I know I said it's gonna help you you got so many errands to do it sounds like it's okay well. i'm just gonna finish get my money orders I won't go shopping out just head on home don't worry about it just try to be safe, keep her safe. to let it get out of bed, because you cannot carry her weight and she doesn't realize that she can't stand right now so she's like okay okay cuckoo she's. crying so I come home and my grandmother's obviously stopped fighting at this time, because now she's falling asleep, and my mom is just standing over her looking at are shaking her head she's like you coming home. I told her you were coming home and she was like well why is it station here, as I go you heard her say that because my mom hasn't been able to understand her. It she's like she just that's the clears i've heard her sound she was so when she was mad when I would let her up this to clear herself. And it's just like she has no energy anymore it's like she got up and became this fighter because she wanted to get up and then now she's just find out that your home. that's just not it's just the burst, you know I explained her the sundowners I said remember the sundowners I told you how it works and. She doesn't mean you any harm mom says, I can't believe she kicked me."
540.0,Provider,So Alice granny had those moments with you to with like the sun downing.
12465.0,Patient,"Oh yes, I realized the sun downing started when she was hospitalized several weeks ago for CHF. um about a month ago, I was letting them know hey she's having you know episodes of sundown a weenie I think you know chart dementia is increasing and that's when she was at St joe's they kind of let it go in one ear and out the other. And she would she's never tried to kick me but she'll just you know she'll get really. wow like your mother wasn't really nice to me anyways and i'd say she'd be because her name is Mary Jane she likes to be called mta. I would say she'd be her mj self um and she just be really nasty because she wasn't unfortunately a nasty woman, I i'm not I didn't have one of those really nice grannies. And she really didn't like me, because I was overweight so long in my life, you know she's kind of call me miss piggy and why he met choose that kind of grandmother um I think I told you a little bit about her being a socialite image was everything to her and. So she would get her mj self which she would just you know push my hand where i'd say no i'll do it, you know she she definitely. Had a status be much less me i'm having to do that with me recently she just doesn't have the energy now she just has a problem, recognizing people when her other two daughters came over the other day she just didn't recognize them and. And once you try it what they would try to speak to her. When they tried to speak to her, they would have to say it's me mom it's debbie or amy air and then what I would speak I was you know. To help them communicate with her, because I couldn't understand what she was saying i'd say granny What was it you say, and I would understand to say, well, how do you understand why does she look your way when you talk. doesn't look at me, so I just had to explain to them when you know i've been taking care of her. So, for her she's used to me, you know it's just what happens in your sole caregiver are the ones that are taken care of you know I also get the most punishment to but she just you know she tunes into me, even if she doesn't necessarily recognize me there's some type of familiarity."
540.0,Provider,"In the beginning of the session, where it kind of goes like that full circle. were just like the infant it kind of those those needs, those basic needs and wants. it's that's the end of life too, so it goes like that circle of life."
12465.0,Patient,"makes sense, makes sense and i'm thinking to myself, the one grandchild she kind of beat up the whole time and old time is the one that's taken care of her. wow and everybody else's deserted her Oh, I had an interesting situation when my family did decide to come over that day. And all about her belongings that one ought to like me about it, she my grandmother has a 55 inch TV that I have in the back that I had originally planned on putting up for her so that she could see it. melt it to the wall have it mounted to the wall, so of course I have it here. And she is bidding for her TV so while she's here she's confused to barely talk mom can I have your TV i'll pay you $250 for it i'm just. Thinking like Oh, my goodness, you all are thousands of dollars you just said, you know she had to wait for money and now you're telling her you're going to pay or for TV that you know you have nope. No intentions on pain, but that's not it I paid to have it taken down at her house bring it over here i'm going to pay to have put up here. And for her and you're just trying to take her TV from her so you can sell it and i've just just so disappointed, but um so I put my foot down, and I said no. TVs not going anywhere staying here with granny she's still here she had the nerve to say, well, what about when she dies, then it absolutely will stay here, where it was meant to be. She was not very happy about that, but it was just I don't know it just rubbed me the wrong way it's not like it it's a TV is not a big deal that that I need it, but I, for me, I felt like it was the principal your bidding it's like ah it's me crazy. Maybe it was because, when she came over she was also trying to talk to her mom. about all the things that have happened recently, because the storm a tree fell on almost fell on her house so she had to pay to somebody cut the tree. And she was talking to just about more money issues like she usually does with her mom and her mom would normally go to help her. But you know with the whole situation and the money thing she hadn't been you know recently since she's been ill and since i've taken over her finances to keep them straight. and So when she was telling granny I was sitting next to her, she was coming from my kitchen into my living room and she realized, I was sitting next to her, and when I was sitting next to her, she. Just went to see me she was like Oh, but i'm not asking for any money, I know I still owe you money but you'll have to wait. And it's already been she's already said out loud several times, while grandmother wasn't around that she has no one teaches on ever pay her back because she just feels she's going to pass away first she says diapers I think that's the way to sell so art. The way she's but um so that was one issue that kind of touched me the wrong way. So I think when she later on brought up the TV thing, which is why I was like absolutely not, this is not going to be a conversation what's up with that TV up and I paid to have it split up it's not going to go to anybody. For it stays here it'll be it'll be my keepsake of her you know, and she just was not happy, she didn't say anything but she wasn't happy. But I feel I reacted that way, because I think I was irritated by the situation where you guys are just trying to divvy everything up and. and take from you know just take advantage of her confusion and her not doing really well, and you know she's barely talking she's mumbling and. If she just mumbles anything that sounds close to a yes you're going to be like oh my mom said I can take the TV I just I didn't want that I felt."
540.0,Provider,Like they're using the circumstances in their advantage.
12465.0,Patient,"Right I just it rubbed me the wrong way, so I just stepped it was like. Oh Absolutely not."
540.0,Provider,"And I think. I think it's also I mean it's a buildup of so many circumstances like she was in the hospital and she was talking to your mom and then trying to get that credit card right so she was trying so. it's not just these circumstances and, unfortunately, I think that these these circumstances, especially bring out the true and people."
12465.0,Patient,"Their true needs are. like this is about. So there was a one of the thing that happened is on that very same day I guess amy wanted to me was i've worked on something that kitchen, I know I was doing something in kitchen but amy was. talking to her mother doing the you know, there was some words that was clear, most of them weren't. But she started crying and I heard my other on say what's wrong, she said mom just said something that hurt me and she was just crying and making a big bullseye run in here. run in there, excuse me and i'm like what's wrong granny are you okay and she's still herself and i'm looking at amy she's crying and she's telling debbie will. She said something that really hurt me it ended up being that she said, my grandmother leaned over to her closer to her and said, you know I love you but you've been very bad. And that made her just cry breakout clients, so I guess I soon I guess she was clear for that moment for what she had to say to her daughter. And it made her cry so of course to keep it all down and keep things on amy decide to go outside so that she can smoke her cigarette and, of course, you know there's no smoking in my home and i'm. I go out there and I said, you know, are you doing Okay, and just like I just can't believe it hurts so bad, maybe she's right I haven't been good I just I just didn't know what to say, and she she would go off into her thought and come back and I would say, well you know. You know she said some things to me as well, and you know you just gotta understand that she's in a place right now, where she has some feelings and maybe. Maybe she meant it Maybe she knew who she was talking to Maybe she didn't um, which is a no, no, this is probably how she felt about me as like I was warring with myself, you know do do I try to console her or let her. wanders and. yeah did her did her mother really say to her because she's disappointed and knowing that she has stolen so much money from her and it upset or. It perhaps Maybe she didn't need to hear it, and hopefully change I don't know, I was working with myself and I had. I didn't want her to be heard, I mean there's so much going on right now and her mother is dying and she's used to being spoiled and getting whatever she wanted and. that's why you know stealing thousand dollars from our mother wasn't a big deal to her. Maybe she needed to hear that I don't know those are all the things that I had going through my head and how to deal with it, but I didn't, you know as much as she doesn't like me and told me I could I could die, and she loved me I don't want to be like her, I don't want to. Let somebody hurt if they don't have to so, but if she would have my grandmother really meant it Maybe she really wanted her to know that she was disappointed in her I I worked with myself, but I did what I."
540.0,Provider,"wanted to do. yeah What did you so did you just end up kind of just saying that I Maybe she did mean it to you, maybe she meant it or didn't mean it kind of just like neutral and a fence."
12465.0,Patient,"Yes, that's why I tried to stay. yeah that's where I tried to stay neutral I said, you know you know it just be okay with it and uh do, what do the best you can buy her during these times. And that's the best is so she's like I can't do this anymore I can't see her like this, I can't come back here I don't want to remember her like this."
540.0,Provider,i'm sorry.
12465.0,Patient,No never apologize I love that sound.
540.0,Provider,You know you want this. sorry he just wants a box here and so okay all right mom is working.
12465.0,Patient,Right. Personal tornado.
540.0,Provider,tornado. tornado.
12465.0,Patient,"So pretty much. It really just broke my heart that she said she can't do it anymore, based on that because it took so much to get her down here to even visit her mom the first place that she hadn't kept giving. She wouldn't come and visit her because you know she was so mad at me for taking over I don't. Maybe she could have seen her mom you know when she wasn't declining so quickly, you know you're. you're counting on her to pass away so you don't have to pay back the money, but you didn't want to come down, and so you didn't want to come down and see her because she was living with me. And you didn't have access to it anymore, maybe your guilt didn't want you to face it, but now you don't want to see her dying so. You know how did you how did you see this going um it was just it was just I felt so much selfishness come from her it just broke my heart. You know your other daughter your other sisters have been here as much as possible, but every time they came to visit you wouldn't come as well, so. When someone addresses you my mother ended up dressing her and saying well if you come down and visit mom or after she said bed, and I can't dry well the truth of the matter is is, you could have come down, but you make excuses by saying telling the other system. Because you rather. I guess i'm just going back and forth with. No. This woman is grieving."
540.0,Provider,And I was.
12465.0,Patient,"Like but she also made her bed so. y'all make mistakes, no let's."
540.0,Provider,"Go get Daddy I will be right back. Sorry, you keep making yeah he keeps making his way to me. yeah i'm gonna have to he knows how to open doors now, so I gotta buy those things I keep on meaning to. But um. I think it's tough and those are said this on you said. has dealt with addiction right she's in the. midst of it still."
12465.0,Patient,"Yes, she's the one with the pill addiction, as well as the gambling yes."
540.0,Provider,"So also understanding, so you have your moral compass and it's correct and your intentions are correct, and you have so much love and everything that you do, you have with good intentions. But sometimes when someone is caught an addiction those behaviors those intentions, the moral compass is. Completely skewed."
12465.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
540.0,Provider,And a lot of that is like the. selfishness behavior it's the me me me mentality. And that can come with those addictive tendencies.
12465.0,Patient,"yeah and, from what I understand with her, because she was the youngest daughter, she was very, very spoiled my grandmother, you know. told me that she did spoil her you know this is conversations that i've learned i've heard it obviously from my mother and my other onset amy was very spoiled she could get whatever she wanted. my grandmother explain why she did it to me, you know so conversation we've had several weeks ago, and she. I had first asked her, she made a comment she's just like she's so spoiled she won't even come see me since I won't give her any money and. I said well why did you spoil her when did you realize she was you know. that's boiling her was not a good thing, she said honestly when I found out how much money she stole from me, so it took you this long to realize that she said yes i've been spoiled on her that long. And she'd been writing me blind and Oh, and she said, the reason, so I asked her why did she how did it start she said, because she was a pre me. And I said Oh, I understand that, because my daughter was referring to, so you have that. You know that mother, you know you know pre me so she said she was just always coddling her and it just kind of went on from there and then she was the youngest. she's the youngest child, as well as she was the last baby girl, and it happened to be the last husband that my grandmother was with who had the money so and that was his daughter, and he loved to spoil her too so um you know, like my mother. and had a different dad and she has one brother and the who passed away 17 years ago from cancer and a sister. And since they were older they was to all five of them was still in the home, but like those three older ones had to stay upstairs why the two youngest one. would go open Christmas gifts before all of them, because they had more Christmas gifts and my grandmother had the mentality of because the husband shoes with the two youngest for his children that. They got them more presence and stuff Maybe other stay up there and. my grandmother said well you guys were older let the little kids go first when my mother was trying to tell those type of things hurt that's what caused the problems in us having. A true relationship with you, and not to mention, I think I mentioned earlier, that that father's also the father that breaks my mother. for so many years so and, once you try to tell my grandmother about it my grandmother put her. In the psych Ward because she didn't You know, as she said at that time you just don't tell what happened in your family so she had to put away, where she was actually my mother was raped again by an orderly when she was put away. So my mother, you know, even though she had a really rock relationship with their own mother. Is she you know she's even been here more work to try to reconcile I can say at one point in time, my grandmother said, I never told you, I loved you enough. I love you Robin and I made my mother cry she's like you're right my you never told me love and she's like I love you. So at least that something good came out of that um but it helps me understand that not only are the addictions, and those those behaviors that come up with it, this young lady has been spoiled her entire life. In been made to feel that she was superior to her sisters and brothers or sisters and one brother, because you know there's the four sisters and the two brothers, but one of the."
540.0,Provider,Most she's just really entitled.
12465.0,Patient,"Very much so, everything is me me me, and when you hear her talk she'll say my mother, my mother, even when she's talking to us, she just doesn't say. mom you know mom said, this is my mom my mom. So yeah everything is about her yeah so you know now that I have a better understanding that my grandmother explains, you know and it's it breaks my heart that she didn't realize till too late, that she had spoiled her, but my grandmother also admitted to me that she herself was spoiled. and The amy is pretty much like she is and like how she was so you know, I guess, a lot of things, a lot of self reflecting when you get sick and you're not up and doing business as much, and when things happen so."
540.0,Provider,"Well, as time slows down, it allows you to take things in from your life and it's really just like you said reflection time."
12465.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. So, no matter how bad she treated me my grandmother, I still just want to make sure that she's comfortable with as possible."
540.0,Provider,"How are you hanging. In there mentally other than I know the sleep is just going to be adding to that, but how are you doing."
12465.0,Patient,"Oh honestly i'm doing Okay, I mean business mode, as far as, and I say business mode because they're saying was you know my career so. I am doing my career, it was about taking care of that taking care of that so in my mindset okay why she's declining quickly, so let me get her funeral arrangements setup. Let me start organizing the House because, when she starts passing when I start to hear the death rattle we get close i'm gonna start calling people to happen common say goodbye, so let me get my house setup to. host people, these are the things that i'm thinking of, and working towards um. I I like to grieve personally by myself, I spend a lot of time with God i'm so once I see myself once. We have like once she's left and. she's been cremated and i've had the home going service for her which I know is going to be a problem is it, why did you do it you're not her kid I that's my mom my mom but you know I know i'm going to deal with all that kind of nonsense, but hey you should have been on it um. I, I know that once I start putting my room back together. Putting my bed back in there that's going to be my time to. deal with a cry and I don't want to say deal because I find myself dealing."
540.0,Provider,"with it. Yes, I will let it like sinking."
12465.0,Patient,"In like a different line see yes i'll let i'll let myself. do with the way that I want to do, but I am you know I still cry cry yesterday today, especially when she's denying the food. And she won't have to force her to have that, for certain you've mentioned in those terms, but I have to. massage her mouth, you know so that she'll try to drink some water, you know things like that I have to motivate her to drink water. I know what the signs are my mind clicks on you know I know the schooling, I know how this works, and so my heart will say and i'm see the blooming. You know, in her face where you know she I see the shutting down, you know I see all the science and I take a moment and I cry I allow myself to feel it I don't try to push it away. Because I don't want everything to hit me all at once, you know I want to be able to deal with it, but I only have so long to actually do that because, if I sit down and take the whole day you know it's just going to try to do something like get out of bed. So I only have so much time. into it, but I do allow myself to go through it."
540.0,Provider,"And I think that i'm not gonna say grieving is different for people that have been in the medical field, but I think so because you see it differently, you see it in a different light you see the process, but you also you know the body."
12465.0,Patient,Right.
540.0,Provider,"And it's also you have that spiritual connection that you, you know that, too, and some people don't have that so you have all of this insight that some people don't have so you can take certain things and also. Though we're only human so you know that if something is said, if she says anything snarky sometimes it's not meant towards you the way that a lot. Oh they'll take that in but just knowing the process but it's also going to go so you're just continuously go go go business mode and like you said just taking those moments, as they come. Right now, but then after this whatever we, whatever your processes to let it sink in and sometimes it may not sink in until a month later. Right you go go go so. The process it's yep and the grieving process is so different for every individual really."
12465.0,Patient,"Absolutely absolutely well, thank you."
540.0,Provider,"Always alright, so we see each other in two weeks at this time our time."
12465.0,Patient,"I don't know. Put it out and. So you want to do it on the 19th you're saying check. Or, if you have i'm going to be starting groups on Tuesdays."
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12465.0,Patient,"And because i've requested to have a later or earlier group I was going through groups at 4pm and that was like right in the middle of the day when I was you know feeding her and things like that, and the young lady. The therapist that was in the group that I was in I tell it was irritating her because you know you're supposed to sit still and stuff like that, but. You know, since she's been here I could not always make her sit still and not move around, so I just requested from Julie, if I could be go to a different group so that I wouldn't be upsetting this bowden."
540.0,Provider,So that's all right so you're going to be going to a group on Tuesdays when does that. You know.
12465.0,Patient,That will be starting the 12.
540.0,Provider,Okay alright so let's see.
12465.0,Patient,So I still would love to keep 7am if you have that on any other day.
540.0,Provider,"Yes, so let's."
12465.0,Patient,"And plus I was irritated Piper group I think she talked more than she allowed us to talk didn't like this, especially for the new people coming in, I felt that they they should have more opportunity not to get off their chest, especially when they're just starting their rehab. I don't know it's just i've been there been going to that group for a while and I guess that that bothered me."
540.0,Provider,"So I I would always say because we're always trying to improve and and that's The thing is, all counselors have a different way of doing groups."
12465.0,Patient,mm hmm.
540.0,Provider,"So I mean many of us, I think that we do I mean some people will do like topics good thing bad thing, but I mean for the most part, all kind of bring up the topic, then let everybody communicate together and."
12465.0,Patient,right there.
540.0,Provider,"So those patients surveys that I mean they're there for like bad things good things in between, if you feel like there's any like improved improvements to be made so even if you made a comment that's not necessarily towards like the therapist herself. But saying like if we could have groups that are more like geared towards like the patients kind of communicating together. and doing it like okay."
12465.0,Patient,"I see what you're saying I catch what you're throwing. Throwing I get it, I get us because yes people she does one question and they'd start, and she interrupt in in they didn't even get to finish their thoughts to go on about what she felt it should be and. I could feel the tension coming from other people and just you know people, just like. And I see that the people that had been on the group longer they just don't say anything at all, like myself, because. I just hate, for that to happen for new people coming in, you know they have a lot of stuff they're dealing with and trying to you know get on all of the stuff that's required and so forth, so I think that's a great way i'm going to go ahead and do that Thank you. for that."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, good So do you mind if I look at my schedule to see what day is would be better for me to do seven."

12465.0,Patient,yeah if you email me I if you can't understand if you email me on the day you can it's easier for me than to wait on hold waiting to talk to them.
