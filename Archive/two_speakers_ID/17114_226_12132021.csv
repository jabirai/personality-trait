Okay okay okay. um yeah but I the whole reason why i've chosen this outpatient program and so that I can make it to all my meetings and unfortunately I missed last week's that i'm not planning on doing that again i'm trying to get my life in order.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so tell me a little bit about your background and what brought you to bright heart heart like why you're seeking services."
17114.0,Patient,"um I mean I have like struggled with using pretty much anything, since I was like 13 um and then I had kids at the age of 21 and I was in a really abusive relationship at the time. So when I was with this guy for 10 years like I kind of normalize like this abuse and I went really long periods without drinking and then I would drink and then every time I did drink a blackout and it'd be chaos um and then, when. So basically he broke my back during an argument i'm like I army crawled out of the kitchen out of the House like went to the hospital and like he fractured my back so they put me on percocet. And then, after the purpose is I. was introduced to cocaine and because I had two kids I didn't have any energy with the purpose as they may be really nauseous and lethargic and like I can barely take care of myself and I was in a lot of pain, so I started self medicating and. I was also going through that breakup. yeah and then continued using cocaine like periodically and I had like a large amount, and I would just like hide it from everybody and nobody knew for like two or three years. and After that I had my third child has my new guy and also like a secret. But. Recently, getting a dui I mean i've gone through a whole lot in this last couple years but my mom she was in a drug and alcohol counseling. As I was growing up so everyone was like really hash hash I didn't ever bring it around me, you know because they're like oh it's not as a mom knows what's up you know. Right and. She relapsed four years ago on methamphetamine and she's currently arrested for. Trafficking over the border. So, like my foundation my rock with my sobriety. is using and now you know institutionalized so that's where I turned like I was really, really at the bottom, I guess, when I got my view I. mean decline this and i'm basically I got my dui and I just was like i'm ready to die, you know, I was just so the press on so many levels, and I was trying to take my medication and then not take it. And then self medicate with alcohol and like just do it myself and my way and it just wasn't working is utter chaos. So um I went down south to go to therapy or good treatment Center. My dad was like Oh, we got a bed for you like we're gonna make sure that you get into this treatment program we already got. Like put money down all this stuff and then the whole plan fell through because he didn't have the funds and like was lying to me about that. And that's when I got my dui and but I was like I guess i'm gonna have to do this myself and then also do this move because i'm trying to get away from sacramento. i'm getting myself in a better place but that's like the short just a bit while i've got this baby."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
17114.0,Patient,"You know. But normally i'm at my family's have like right now i'm staying with my fiance's family. they're all like jehovah's witness very good people you know don't drink or use around me they've been taking me to meetings I recently got a sponsor. So i'm trying to do all that work, you know. it's not just one or two therapies it's a month i'm having to exercise this like all day long. Yes to stay sober yeah. yeah yeah. But recently got introduced to God so that's cool you know i'm like learning learning to lean on him and trust him with all of this because before I never really went to church or. knew anything about that and I had a lot of resentment towards everybody for like not making things happen for me. um so my spiritual side is definitely like growing and i'm learning a lot more, so I can lean on that with my sobriety and to be sober you know I guess it's like the backbone of it which I always always missing. But. I have three kids and one has autism."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, how old are your kids."
17114.0,Patient,"Four or five and one. Okay yeah so definitely handful over here but luckily my X is watching the two right now. But my goal is to continue my sobriety and get a really good routine for myself to be happy and healthy before I take them back because i've tried to just come back before and it's not good, because i'm just doing and doing and doing, and then I end up being. crazy."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so you have a good co parenting relationship with your ex."
17114.0,Patient,"um yes, I mean, for, as well as it could be, you know. On the terms that we left on you know we both it took me a lot of time to get over that it's hard for me to even talk to him, no, but I do understand that you know. i'm gonna have to talk to him for my kid. Normally I have family that have watched her. Like, why did my. Okay."
226.0,Provider,Any like any suicidal thoughts any any suicidal ideation.
17114.0,Patient,"um when I was drinking, yes, you know. Like I do the chaos thing and then. After the chaos, I was like you know covered and embarrassment, and like didn't want to show my face anywhere, and you know I mean there's thoughts, then, but not now."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so no no. um any any suicide attempt. No okay so low risk of suicide, how much sobriety do you have China."
17114.0,Patient,I have a month and about two weeks now.
226.0,Provider,pick right. yeah.
17114.0,Patient,"Any can I. um I would say yes, with the family stuff going on the last month or so, and so, when I told that to the last doctor who mentioned like gabapentin. yeah and I did use that two days ago because, like. I was like i'm not trying to feel this way you know. yeah i'm going to go backwards on everything i've been working on. Right, so I like told my fiance i'm like i'm really triggered right and also i'm kind of his family kind of pushed me into getting a job right now."
226.0,Provider,uh huh.
17114.0,Patient,And I didn't realize how much a job is a trigger for me because it's like being around other people learning something new that I don't understand. You know that's huge sugar for me and I told him i'm like I don't know if i'm ready for that. Right now.
226.0,Provider,it's cool that.
17114.0,Patient,"He is cool with that, but I feel like his family's like well you're gonna have to do things that make you uncomfortable you know and i'm like well i'm not ready for that. Like I i'm trying to say it out loud and they're just pushing me to do it. and obviously I know I have bills to pay and all that but i'm like obviously I have my hands full here if you can't. Oh yeah you know. yeah so. Really. half asleep."
