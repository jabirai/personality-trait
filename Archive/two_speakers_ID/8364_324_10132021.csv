8364.0,Patient,it's going good. Just settling in with the new job and.
324.0,Provider,"I know you are the hot, you are a hospital. Okay you're not there anymore."
8364.0,Patient,I still have my on call status there if I. want to pick up shifts. But I am full time at a at Budweiser incorporated.
324.0,Provider,I remember you said okay oh. And how much longer to the little one gets here.

324.0,Provider,December okay. Okay.
8364.0,Patient,yeah too low.
324.0,Provider,let's see so how's everything else go on. medication.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah I was able to pick everything up, thank you for that. And it's going well, when I worked. Three to 11 I usually take. My first dose at around 12 and my second. But four or five. And then, when I get off. eat something and take. The tutor. And seems to be going just fine. Now, if I work in the mornings I just you know wake up or take my first."
324.0,Provider,House earlier.
8364.0,Patient,"And I haven't had any problems. Like today i'll work three to three to 11 and. So they. Take my first dose and at around noon. So in the morning i'm a little tired, but. After I take my first dose and it seems to kick in for me."
324.0,Provider,"On medications. And you should have took your bottles because i'm having a problem with. they're not putting the refills on there, for some reason I put refills."
8364.0,Patient,And then they never do.
324.0,Provider,"It doesn't show up on, for example, i'm. Under to the Lord rested on 6030 tablets when we feel. And I was on the 26th of September."
8364.0,Patient,"I can check it but. Normally, they wait for you to send it. It does say one refill before 926. So. I don't know. that's already passed."
324.0,Provider,It should be before 926 or 22.
8364.0,Patient,You know yeah.
324.0,Provider,"Yes, I give you a year okay okay so you're a walgreens if you don't have it on automatic, then you would have to call in the prescription every prescription number and having me feel it."
8364.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"Or you can set up automatically fields and they'll automatically in 30 days we fill it. But you have to set it up and there's an APP to walgreens Have a nice little APP you can. Also, do the refills. Anyway, the refill is. On there. For the US for all and the rise of dawn. You can't do we build on the at all."
8364.0,Patient,Right.
324.0,Provider,"And then i'll have to, of course, and further out across the land. Use far."
8364.0,Patient,yeah abuse brown does too.
324.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah when it's time you can actually call those two and i'll. have to actually still do the other two."
8364.0,Patient,"it's good to know, noise and paying attention today."
324.0,Provider,"Oh, how sweet house sleep on and he said, are you sleeping through the night or difficulty in falling asleep."
8364.0,Patient,"Now everything seems. seems pretty regular. Once I take the two that night it's usually within the hour i'm ready to go to sleep. If an hour. and I wake up a couple times throughout the night like with dreams and stuff but. Before I even. was taking a regimen I wasn't dreaming at all, so I feel like that's better sleep anyway. And then I bought this my whole life i've always been tired in the mornings, when I wake up every once in a while I won't be but, for the most part i'm. Pretty tired until I take my adderall and. That seems to snap me out of all that."
324.0,Provider,Any appetite issues.
8364.0,Patient,No. Still eating regularly.
324.0,Provider,Because like I said I was asked about appetite because it can be pretty. happy to say i'm just not hungry at all.
8364.0,Patient,"I haven't I haven't really had that issue. everything's been going just fine. it's been going just fine I thought i'd have. The adjustment period or whatever, but. Not at all. I haven't done too many midnight shift or you know 11 to seven in the mornings so. I really don't know how i'll be on on that schedule, but I may be put on that schedule later. So then we'll go from there when. When that happens."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, so right now the kind of just have you just say. Honestly seventh through the 11th. there."
8364.0,Patient,"yeah so how it works Budweiser is it's on seniority that they pick their schedules and normally if they've been there a while they. they're clogging up the the seven to 11 or seven to three shifts and me being low seniority all wind up either 12 to seven or. Hopefully, three to 11 notes that was my first preference is shifts. That figure when the baby comes. She worked 730 to 430. And if I can be 311 we'd only need someone to. Help out for a couple hours there, instead of like an all day thing. So i'm fingers crossed on that one. i'm still going through training and. Once they. Do this forklift training, which is like a two day process. Then they put me in a position, and that will that training takes three to six weeks, then they can kind of go from there. The way over time works if nobody signs up the low seniority gets kind of forced into it on the weekends. So we'll see you know could be like a seven day a week thing for a while until I have some seniority but. we're not there yet it's still going to be a month or two before all all those. drafts and stuff start to kick in."
324.0,Provider,"overtime is not is different view. it's often we have extra shift, if you want to pick up. Are you saying is mandatory."
8364.0,Patient,"it's it's optional to a point, like you can sign up for it on your own but say I don't sign up and they don't have enough people to sign up if whatever i'm trained in is a position that they need someone the lowest seniority it becomes mandatory for them so. it's time and a half, on Saturdays and Sundays is double time so it's. Some good to it and you don't have to work Saturday to get double time on Sunday, so I mean. You know a lot of people they'll just work Sunday through Friday take their Saturday off. But i've heard of a lot of people like. You know, they just work. 60 days straight and maybe have a day off and then work another 30 days straight, you know until they get. To they get their seniority yep and that usually takes a couple years so. it's kind of like you know weather the storm, for the first couple years and then. can get a little bit more choosy with what days. yeah being thrown into this new position, since I have my own Board was late, I have one sick day and then I guess they credit your birthday is like a holiday that floats you can like put it on whatever day you want. So from now till the end of the year, I technically have two sick days. And then, when the new year comes they give you six for the year. And it's the sort of thing, where, if you don't use it, you lose it. there's some pluses and minuses to it all but. yeah when you're working you just going to be working a lot pretty much is what it is."
324.0,Provider,You get this from Jordan.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah and then still you know you still minimum of five days. And like I said, your vacation or sick days they don't roll over you gotta kind of use them so."
324.0,Provider,You know changes job and everything how have you been like your your mood mood anxiety because again.
8364.0,Patient,"My anxieties, been a little high. At nights oh I. found myself last week, like even dreaming about work. which was irritating. And I was trying my best to recognize that and and try and. Use tools from group and what have you they're trying to refocus and. look at it from a distance and tried to. rewire the brain to. To not fall back into that and. It seems to be working the last couple nights I haven't had like those dreams and but i'll wake up and be thinking about it and then i'll recognize it and again. use my tools to. To try and. flush that away and refocus on something different or look at it from a distance and. This seems to be helping to do that. But yeah been a little bit more anxious but i'm. Just still recognizing and at least you know. it's not letting this spiral out of control."
324.0,Provider,Any point any any self harm everyone.
8364.0,Patient,"And I got a two cousins that actually work there, and one of them's been there for like six years and he's telling me. When he first started, he was so stressed out and stuff and. i'm like yeah i'm trying not to do that because I can't and. Luckily i'm. In group and been doing this sort of stuff and it's it really does help me out because i'm. Like I said recognize it and use the tools that i've learned to. Try and just flush it out and refocus to something else and."
324.0,Provider,"For any point like I said, like email send me the email. As far as physically not able to make it that's perfectly fine. As far as what for our next appointment. again. Open schedule was happens, let me know. And we'll. we'll turn around."
8364.0,Patient,"Are we already scheduled, or do we need to do that."
324.0,Provider,"For weeks. Well, they. Have a tip in the 11th which is Thursday."
8364.0,Patient,Something around the same time 11.
324.0,Provider,I have 11 on Thursday.
8364.0,Patient,"i'll do that. yeah normally I get off to the lab and i'll be home by 1120 says that's good another good part is. Not coming to the city like I was before I started working at the hospital so i'm home. i'm actually home earlier than if I worked at three to 1130 at the hospital with Budweiser because, for whatever reason, they pay you for your lunch at Budweiser which is kind of cool. So I usually will like I said i'll eat eat a little something that take my medication with and then. After that i'm pretty much take a shower go to bed. If i'm if i'm asleep by one that's that's pretty good. And normally I am."
324.0,Provider,let's take summer remember the. 11am.
8364.0,Patient,On the calendar.
324.0,Provider,Okay. 1130 on Wednesday.
8364.0,Patient,The 11th for work.
324.0,Provider,I have 14 and 11 on that person. Oh God it was clear. But I do have 1130 on the 10th which was that Wednesday.
8364.0,Patient,That will work. All right. You got the calendar.
324.0,Provider,To make sure you don't want other.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah they Let me pick up the prize lamb around the same time as the other ones, and then the adderall for, for whatever reason it's like. A week later, when they released that one. And it works out I don't run out or anything like that, but. Just to have that that's usually have a little bit more time."
324.0,Provider,I take between the pharmacies and the insurance.
8364.0,Patient,yeah and.
324.0,Provider,The other thing going.
8364.0,Patient,"The other thing at walgreens, for whatever reason, every time I go to the same thing with the adderall they're like Oh, do you have any insurance and i'm like. No, I told you, I pay for that out of pocket. My insurance doesn't cover it. And they're like Oh, we need to make a note and i'm like yeah that's what you guys said, the last seven times you know and. They never do and it it's always like Oh well, we'll put it through now and i'm like okay so, then I have to wait another day whatever, but I always do it in time to where I won't run out or whatever."
324.0,Provider,"Can you remember, if we try to do a proper optimization."
8364.0,Patient,"I believe we spoke about it, I don't know if you did do that or not."
324.0,Provider,Sometimes they'll come. back and check.
8364.0,Patient,"Okay yeah, for whatever reason, partnership doesn't cover it because i'm over the age of 18 that's what they tell me. i'm gonna get new medical to this job eventually i'm still learning about it to this training they need an even mention it. I got one little piece of mail about it i'm assuming it's just going to come out of. The paycheck but. i've only had one so far so and I, I still haven't got this pay Stub on that i'm going to actually print that out today. So. I don't know forgot to talk to someone in HR or whatever to see exactly what the medical is because, or if i'm just waiting on more mail from them, I don't know. From what I understand it's pretty good but. we'll see and then that that was My other concern was once I get on this medical is it going to affect anything that we got going on, or whatever so. i'm a little nervous about that, but. there's nothing I can really do about it until I know about it, you know. Hopefully you guys accept whatever it is, and we don't have to mess up thanks to that hate to have to go through all this again with someone out."
324.0,Provider,Of. town.
8364.0,Patient,"it's happened to me many times over the years and it's always a pain, because get on a regimen that. works, and then you get a new doctor and all of a. Sudden they don't. They don't want to do any of it, you know so. And then that will mess."
324.0,Provider,That will start all over and.
8364.0,Patient,yeah that would mess me up so. i'm just. I have not either.
324.0,Provider,i'm looking at okay So you see Julie on the 15th.
8364.0,Patient,mm hmm. yep.
324.0,Provider,I was trying to say why are you in the yellow here.
8364.0,Patient,"I think it was from. miss them appointment with us, I think I missed an appointment with Julia had to reschedule. And I emailed. Julie, I think, and then by the time I got her email back she told me to go to the virtual. clinic in the day they had already passed and then I emailed you late about our last group session so it's probably. Probably what it is."
324.0,Provider,"Oh here's my question um. i'm. out this festival Julie, I don't play in an issue, if you would like, we can actually decrease your groups to twice a month, instead of week one. If you. If you want to come weekly you can but."
8364.0,Patient,yeah let me yeah let me know that. My.
324.0,Provider,"Work yeah. I might help out, it might be a lot trying to do, every week to say. The medications that you're on a lot for you to at least come weekly like I said, the first couple months, and you can contrast the sample. And again, if you. want to do. Then you can go see it will be set at once a month."
8364.0,Patient,Okay well yeah let me know and group next week or if you need longer than that just whenever you know yeah let me know and. How to help the nine and turnarounds a little harder than 11 but.
324.0,Provider,Now I run a bar and like I say almost. Days of mine is pushing it I have 11pm 4pm 6pm. yeah i'll run that by her.
8364.0,Patient,Okay. If it gets to be too much then i'll ask to do the 11 maybe but is the 11 with Julie or someone else.
324.0,Provider,It is someone else's with actual. Okay yeah.
8364.0,Patient,So I don't know if i'd want to switch that are not.
324.0,Provider,"Also, you Alan see one therapy session or. Over."
8364.0,Patient,For group or for.
324.0,Provider,Judges individual surely.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah like I said I had I had to reschedule the last one, and by the time she was when I went to the virtual clinic and they rescheduled me that was all they had so okay. It is what it is, I don't I don't know how to sneak another one, yes, the."
324.0,Provider,Other thing to even. Though you have two weeks.
8364.0,Patient,she's available but.
324.0,Provider,When you meet with her Friday. And you can mention to her to i'm going to try to get the whole heart today about the twice a month group and even the option of monthly individuals.
8364.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"yeah. there's some you know, some people that have monthly individual therapy so twice a month. yeah so that's that's an option and again if you. feel like show me to see your twice a month, you can."
8364.0,Patient,"But I think she might have mentioned that well. it's been a while, since we. Last. talked about it yeah so i'll bring it back up and say that you had mentioned it and see what she says."
324.0,Provider,Okay i'll run it by.
8364.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
324.0,Provider,"So I will see you in proof. yep either this week or even next week Oh, we got up there."
8364.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,Especially if we're doing every. Twice a month I don't see that being an issue.
8364.0,Patient,Okay well you know also next one.
324.0,Provider,"is actually what I do i'll try to get a hold of her today and she says. and select you know social work, you know Friday."
8364.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"kitchen email it, you know."
8364.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good. Okay, and. My work schedule usually doesn't come out until like Thursday. So I don't know the next week, until then, so it kind of leaves me. Friday Saturday Sunday Monday to kind of figure that out okay. So for Tuesday. As long as I stay on the same schedule, it should be okay."
324.0,Provider,"So yeah awesome she says, I hope she can have an answer. or."
8364.0,Patient,"yeah because. If, for whatever reason, they throw me on the midnight shift then. Obviously, getting off at seven in the morning and then making a nine a group might be a little tough. But we'll see I should say I feel. All right, thank you."
324.0,Provider,"All right, take."
