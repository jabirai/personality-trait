2751.0,Patient,"like myself like mainly like I have like really bad anxiety. And like really bad depression and I know like. Okay medications are part of that, obviously, but."
527.0,Provider,sure.
2751.0,Patient,"Like I don't know I just like I don't want to be depressed and I have like really bad social anxiety. Right, where like I like cannot go out. In public you know I mean like I can but I like I psyched myself out a lot, you know. And like. It that's affecting like that's my relationship, you know."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2751.0,Patient,"It seems like that's like just depression, anxiety and and like I just there's like tracing myself, like me, my well he's technically my ex husband, but work together so you know. Okay, he just got out of prison, he was gone for four years, so we're like. I don't know I feel like we had like a toxic relationship kind of as. I have. One have a good one, but I want to work on me like learn how to be better myself, you know. sure of trying to like shove things down his throat, you know, like do this and do."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. sure. Sure well and i'm sure, things are probably shifted a lot between the two of you in the last four years to. Know you're probably a different different. You know life life issues, right now, or. Different for most ideal."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah that's been done for Twitter hard you out tonight. Is yeah I spare me we fight we fight in a lot, but more oh he's like the type he likes to go out and go do things and. Go you know hangouts and of course you'd like missed out on all those years of his life. You know, like sure here I am like no stay home with me deal with me i'll be around me me me me me know. Okay well that's like that's the one of our main issues, I think."
527.0,Provider,So so let's tell me a little bit like how long you guys have been together like when did you guys get married and divorced and.
2751.0,Patient,"We we met in rehab and 20 the end of 2013. Okay over the beginning of 2014 and I would say, maybe we're started being together, and then we got married 2015. And then. I divorced him like a year and him being in prison. Okay um I don't know like for me like I look back on it now I regret it, but like at the time, like it's what I was like really clean and sober I was like there was like doing things accomplishing things like really like. Should I. kind of almost have like a snobby look towards people who are like newcomers, you know, and I like got to that point and um and he had relapsed in prison and I didn't even give him a. shot, I was like. nope that's it we're done we're done. Okay, so now I have talked to him for a while, like a month or two, when the time is a chemist and stuff and we started talking again and then. So we you know stayed together after like a little bit after that, like still like the so called me on my cell phone management, but we're not like legally married."
527.0,Provider,Sure sure. So it sounds like you guys didn't have a whole lot of time in your marriage before. He left for present.
2751.0,Patient,No. And we're both using heavily together. yeah okay oh we're like in and out of rehab see other do you talk to each other and stuff yeah so.
527.0,Provider,"Okay. what's what's your motivation for the relationship at this point like what do you, what do you need to see happen."
2751.0,Patient,"Like I want I want. I just want to be like, I want to feel more love, like, I want to feel what it's like that wantonness you know."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
2751.0,Patient,"I don't know and he does he's what I feel like he's more of like he does like shows does stuff and that's how he showed me love you know. And, like me, I feel like I need like. The you know the hugs and affection and that stuff which is weird because prior to him going to present it was like the complete opposite like prior he's changed so much like. He is he used to be the affectionate lovey lovey kissy all that and I was more of like the standoffish like. Okay, I love that you know attitude and now it's weird it's totally flipped. No, no."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I. Just think about like. You know how much sobriety changes somebody to like. Things. You know priority priorities and needs and wants desires change and shift through that process too so. You know that that may be part of it, too, so figuring out how you guys need to get on the same page with one another, like know what each other's wants and needs are and and can support each other in that sense. And, and I think just understanding, you know that you're seeing some of the after effects after effects of. of recovery is now i've got all these feelings to deal with, and I did wasn't dealing with them before, and now you know now, I have to look at them, otherwise you know i'm likely going to lead back into a relapse for myself if I don't deal with things."
2751.0,Patient,"Well yeah I was always never dealt I feel is like good like I don't give a Fuck type of attitude, you know, like, I was like that, and then. I don't know like like you all share, like a 2016 and i'll change like I don't know like I got pregnant he got arrested 98 months pregnant, though, but because he had relapsed and I didn't know, and I mean I knew, but like I was in denial. And then, like I just I just started doing really good from there, you know, but then two years in. My relapse on the North coast and stuff and then that's what my doctor put me on suboxone and then I still did really good off the math though you know I you know, did I had over four years off of that."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2751.0,Patient,"And I had relapsed on that and so i've had two or three relapses on that sense, you know starting and bright heart and all that but. As you know, yes, my Irish most recent was like three weeks ago but. Okay yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, what happened three weeks ago can."
2751.0,Patient,"I was just out and I never go out, you know I mean, and I was with somebody who around it and i've been like depressed that you know, like, I have no excuse for it it's just hard like if."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I think, just understanding."
2751.0,Patient,"triggers yeah what happens. It was just there and go through it, you know, like, I just wanted to feel better I don't know why I. wonder well What, though, you know I can I never really understood I don't understand my emotions, you know. Why, I do think I do and. And why I am the way I am like I don't understand at all. yeah like I like I tend to treat people like like in my family like you know I treat my mom like shit you know, and I always have something like 15. And I don't know why you know I mean, but I know i'm doing it, you know mean it makes me feel bad about myself, but I don't know why, or like like i'll treat my husband nice treat him a certain way, but I love him, you know I mean, but why, why would I treat my life I love. You know."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah yeah So where do you think things shifted and changed for you do, you did anything happened like during adolescence that's kind of."
2751.0,Patient,I mean yeah yeah we I don't know if I consider it like. Like molestation because it was like two boys like one was my was older and we were literally like five and six year old you know.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
2751.0,Patient,"And there's that and then there was, I had another incident which i'm not ready to like talk about yet okay that i'm not so yeah there was a little yeah Okay, but um."
527.0,Provider,Other than. Some drama that's led to just. The behaviors and just the emotions.
2751.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't know. What. i'm gonna I want to work, obviously don't want to be the same yeah if that's part of what you and you talk about it i'm just not ready for about four yet okay yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Have you ever shared anything I mean have you, you know in any of your other therapies can like it."
2751.0,Patient,"And you know what they've asked like have you been sexually abused, I would say yeah you know but it's not going."
527.0,Provider,OK OK so there's not you haven't really delved into any of that trauma work for yourself. Okay okay.
2751.0,Patient,that's scary.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, what do you think's most scary about it, like."
2751.0,Patient,"I saw like thinking about it, I don't It makes me feel like i'm the one bros yeah. Just the person who it was exciting."
527.0,Provider,"Did was it ever. So i'm guessing it's never been reported, or anything when you were younger, you told anybody, you know when okay."
2751.0,Patient,"No, no. Okay, nobody knows."
527.0,Provider,Does your husband now.
2751.0,Patient,"He Well he knows now, like him, he he he knew about those two kids you know, but whatever happened them but he's not here or anything. I just not ready to say. Okay, all right. Oh yeah and we're definitely not going."
527.0,Provider,"To you know, talk, talk about it today, because you know when when you do trauma work can you have to first of all, you have to have. You know, an understanding of what the you know goals are going to look like for that kind of work, but you also have to have you know, a safety plan in place, you also have to have some coping strategies in place, like a support system like those are things that. that are going to need to be in place before you start you know really delving into that trauma work because it does bring up a lot of you know what's going to be my relapse plan you know. Because I may get triggered and So how do I, you know manage that So yes, there's lots of different things and factors that need to be in place before. And just emotional stability, you know if there's if you know if the Depression and anxiety is not manageable than it's definitely. You know it's going to make it more difficult and I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that work with you, if you weren't emotionally it more emotionally stable to to manage it."
2751.0,Patient,yeah so. yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah but also you know, keeping in mind that that is something and it sounds like it's something that you want to be able to work on and address at some point for yourself and just be able to. You know work through those experiences and and the feelings attached to that for yourself and. and probably. how you feel about yourself to like definitely impacts probably relationships and and just your self self worth too."
2751.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,Do you have much of a support system around you.
2751.0,Patient,My kids and my husband that's about it. yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,"So tell me about so tell me a little bit about your family, because you mentioned, you know that. You know kind of lash out or not always. The best. Best and responding to your family."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah like my will my dad knew my dad you know he's always been like one of my best friends, you know I mean like I can always tell him stuff and like he doesn't judge me he doesn't you know nothing like we've always been close my mom and me. I just I just I have like this, like not like a hatred, but kind of like it you don't mean like. Okay, like I don't know why I cheer like shit you know, but then I have an older brother, but I don't know him very well six years apart so like we're not you know. i'm older brother and then, I have a younger sister and then it's just me and then my two kids."
527.0,Provider,Okay. yeah yeah so What was it like growing up with mom then let's go ahead. Is there anything that you can like you know kind of pinpoint like that happened with you and mom or.
2751.0,Patient,"Like she was always trying to change me, you know. I place like she never accepted me for who I was, I think that she always like compared like. Like my little sister was like the shining star family, you know it sounds so stupid, but like she would always like you know why can't you just like her, I can't you know academically it'd be like her, I can't use always her I can I be like her, you know. Okay okay. That brings up that makes me angry like. Everybody I know my mom loves know to me it's like my parents were great parents, you know, like they both provided and like like I had a good childhood you mean I had a good upbringing like I just. That we're not close like were like families get together and like hug and like oh I love you, you know. it's so weird to me that people do that you know, like awkward like like. My gosh but. But yeah. Because one thing I can think of."
527.0,Provider,"So how old were you when mom started doing that, with. you like, how do you remember."
2751.0,Patient,I don't think.
527.0,Provider,She started comparing you to your sister.
2751.0,Patient,"my sister sister younger than me, so I mean it wasn't till I was in my teens at least now. You know, or you know, or maybe mid 20s maybe you know any mean because. my sister. That all you know tracking you know high school graduate you know, I was a high school dropout and I was a drug addict and I was you know this, that whatever. I mean they've always been there to support me, though, to something where it's like this weird dynamic, you know it's like they've been like these really great parents, but then it's like the but everybody has balls you know, and I know I want i'm just."
527.0,Provider,"Sure well and and I think parents can be good parents, but still have like you said their flaws and not. Maybe not sounds like maybe be there emotionally they weren't there emotionally in a way that you needed them to be in those crucial. Years you know those teenage years where you know you're pretty influential over you know more so with your peer group, you know that's kind of who you look too, but. You know, I hope that you know your parents can also provide some guidance as well and, and you know support you emotionally of how hard, this being a teenage girl."
2751.0,Patient,"I got the I got bullied like a lot to like from like seventh grade on and it sounds so dumb like i'm so it makes me so much more over protective of my kids because, like I don't ever have to go through that like."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
2751.0,Patient,"You know, like so and there's things that like I need to work on as a mom because I feel like I kind of like conceived things that I do, that my mom did you know."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure.
2751.0,Patient,"Not being like emotionally available for them and, and so I I don't I wanna I don't want to carry that on you."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah try to break that cycle of patterns for yourself. yeah yeah. yeah how old are your girls now. 11 and 411 and four okay.
2751.0,Patient,"yeah so kaylee went through the addiction, they mean well I didn't have her my parents had her good like I had her from today till she she was like a year and a month old when I went to my first rehab. Okay, and. My parents, how are you know, up until she was I just got custody back and we're. Like she was 10 I know Tyler just recently like two years ago. Okay yeah. And i've had you know the whole time. Everything so."
527.0,Provider,"yeah how, how is that going, is there any conflicts between the girls in regards to that."
2751.0,Patient,"And I don't know about, I know, between them, I think, between me and kaylee there are. there's a lot of. She has a lot of I can just tell like she tells me, you know she's very we get. I don't handle myself well in arguments when I feel like i'm being attacked. And so, like when. When I have my kid coming at me attacking me she has she has she been diagnosed with CD and she's got her own you know issues and she's you know exploring like the LGBT cutie and. And she's dealing with her own stuff but like she tends to lash out at me and I will lash out back like you know guilty I yell at you know no stop or that's how I was raised, you know. My show stop don't do that. And so, like she to got quiet person I she's very smart and we hope to be fight, but we, you know it reminds me of me and my mom me and her me. Okay, and I don't know if that you know me not being there is little."
527.0,Provider,yeah does she ever throw things back in your face his car is. No comments or anything that trigger you.
2751.0,Patient,"i'm not like addiction, why not like not that like she'll those things if I say you know, like she'll say stuff you know, like you know you're not the only one that has problems mom or you know, like no wonder, Nick always wants to leave you or you know she'll say stuff like that. Okay, he has like she already hit where it's you know."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah definitely.
2751.0,Patient,"And she'll she'll have big big freak out so like if I tell her no for something like literally, the other day she wanted she called home from school she hit the back of her head."
527.0,Provider,On the concrete okay.
2751.0,Patient,"Then, like an hour later she wanted to walk to my parents and go get her cell phone charger I see haley no I said, I have a charger to have iphones yes, I have. A charger. charger know no, no, she I mean she just for flip out because I wouldn't want talking i'm like kayla you literally just hit your head. Like sure like so she's very irrational the way I am like i'm very air. You know."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah have you guys done any family therapy at all cam or.
2751.0,Patient,"No, I want to, but. Okay, a lot it's like it's almost like how do I find it all in one you know good it's like I feel a different providers and she has Kaiser through her dad so that's where we've been having our struggles finding someone because. Okay guys, are you know so it's like how do I find a provider that does Kaiser and medical I don't know how to this confuses me."
527.0,Provider,You know.
2751.0,Patient,I don't want to do all that.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
2751.0,Patient,It is something I want to do you know.
527.0,Provider,Sure does she have a. Individual therapist.
2751.0,Patient,"know, I have to that's Another thing I look forward to is this for a provider for her because she was very picky at first she wanted someone who was like LGBT cutie and. They don't just announced that on the Kaiser websites you."
527.0,Provider,Know sure.
2751.0,Patient,"yeah so I noticed with partnership, though they did you know. It would say you know LGBT friendly, so I was like thinking like. Okay, take her off of her dad and her back online and and then you know she can go that route, but then she told me know that she as long as it's a female you know. try again, so my."
527.0,Provider,"I guess my suggestion I because I used to work for insurance, I used to work for anthem doing case management, before I came over here. But you might check in with Kaiser and see if they can give you a list of female therapists like if they can see it in their system. If there's a list of female therapist that also have experience working with the lb G cutie gotta get all the letters in there. yeah so um. yeah so they they might be able to narrow the search down for you, for her as well yeah."
2751.0,Patient,So definitely I want to get her into that.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and that might even be a good start just having some individual therapy for her and then that. therapist you know, maybe able to pull you in to do some family work in addition. Or at least you know, keep keep you guys, you know update you on progress and keep you guys working on, you know communication skills are things that are you know that would be helpful, or to change, you know patterns and behaviors at home for you guys, to be more successful with each other."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah because I feel like it's a very like it's like a very negative not to negative, but I feel like every bad mood you know. Like you know my. My husband's hard working or you know when he comes in earlier and she's in a bad mood because you know whatever's going on in her life, you know and i'm depressed you know and then there's little it was too slow spitfire you know but. This is like I said, like, I feel like I help I remember like what I do remember like my home being like not negative, but like you said wasn't like a happy place you know."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure.
2751.0,Patient,"I do not want to really I swore I would never relive that you know what I mean it's like almost kind of like that's what it is, you know."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure.
2751.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and probably i'm guessing it just kind of gets lost in the shuffle you know she's kind of doing her own thing because you guys are kind of consumed in your own individual. You know, you know things issues that are going on with each of you and trying to sort through all of that so it's kind of like everybody's living independently. versus like a family."
2751.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah.
527.0,Provider,"So Kim Where would you want to start, I mean, where do you want to kind of start delving into things for yourself."
2751.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know how to do this, like i've tried therapy a couple other times and. To me it's like it just it's just a waste of time because I didn't get any I mean I it wasn't going anywhere it wasn't it wasn't I mean I mean i've all i've learned, like the breathing techniques and like you know the box breathing and all that stuff like. I don't know I don't know what I need you know what I mean I don't know like I don't not."
527.0,Provider,sure what what was not helpful before i'm therapy.
2751.0,Patient,"I mean basically all I did was talk and they just kind of sat there were like uh huh. Okay, they just like no, you have to yell use your right to feel that way, or you know, or maybe she'll give this a try, which I mean. I guess it's good to have outside perspective, you know I mean, but I don't know I feel like we've made the applet media my fault, though, because I only do the application part of the stuff all the time either."
527.0,Provider,You know okay okay.
2751.0,Patient,"So I got to get better at like like doing it, the application of things that people tell me like. What if. A situation arises, you know."
527.0,Provider,"yeah definitely the well the other piece too i'm wondering is, if you just need some specific direction like because one of the things i'm thinking is just giving you some assignments to work on, you know intentionally in our sessions. With yeah you know specific direction for you, because I know a lot of times when people come into therapy. they've either had a bad experience it's not word or they've you know or they've been through therapy so many times that they just kind of know what to say and just kind of breeze through it and. But what I hear from you is that I want to feel better, and I want my family better, and I want to break the cycle of patterns of negative behaviors. For myself, and for my family, so that we can live in a healthy loving family environment, and so we are going to probably have to tackle some difficult things. In in that process, but I can definitely give you some direction as far as like specific homework assignments to kind of work on and and that may help you because. A lot of times we don't even know what we're feeling or how to figure out what i'm feeling like is it you know I may, I know what maybe depression is and anxiety is but. You know what about abandonment or grief, or you know anger, or you know some of those other feelings that sometimes get stuffed down inside. And banned or pushed away because. i've been using and have had used in the past and numbed out all those feelings, so I don't even know really where to begin trying to identify those for myself that. You know and and how to manage those when i'm in my sobriety now so yeah we can definitely explore some of those things for you, too, because that might. be helpful, as far as and I don't know if if you tried, you know doing any journaling at times you know when your heads just kind of racing with thoughts, just to. put those out on paper and just kind of you know just kind of let it be a purge for you like here's all my thoughts that i'm having and there can be no rhyme or reason to them, but I. just have to get them out of my head, because they just keep going over and over and over and not not going anywhere for myself so."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah he hasn't been drawing a pass I actually like I feel it's been a while, but I filled up one girl just recently, and I gotta get rid I like to like get rid of them know like burn them get rid of them, you know. yeah oh. Sure sure yeah definitely and that's what I always tell people if they have journals you know, especially."
527.0,Provider,"You know, put them in a place where you feel like they can be safe and that's your personal you know outlet for yourself like. Or if you need to lock it in a in a closet or you know somewhere that you feel like Okay, this is my safe place for for what's going on with me as i'm working through things because yeah you need to know that that's protected information for yourself to so. yeah yeah yeah because you don't want everybody reading, you know some of the things that. That you've experienced."
2751.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,"it's I mean it's hard enough for you to management manager, let alone, you know gosh What if my daughter found it and. yeah yeah you've got little ones that that can read and. So yeah yeah. yeah, so I think definitely maybe getting in touch with Kaiser for your daughter, and that way at least getting her connected with somebody. You know, because i'm sure there probably is like some confusion on her end are lots of different emotions about you know, I was away from mom so long and then now i'm back with mom and like how do I it's kind of like your restarting you know, being a parent with."
2751.0,Patient,"An 11 year old now. Sorry. No go ahead and hurt her dad so it seems like they let her do it if she wants, you know so i'm like the disciplinary on you know, like i'm the one that says no, so I think that was a lot of it too. But."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so it's you know definitely a transition for the two of you that's gonna you know, try to figure out how to maneuver this relationship with each other. yeah yeah and if you're trying to set limits and stuff yeah i'm sure there's getting you're getting the pushback. yeah."
2751.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,How is how is your dad with her like.
2751.0,Patient,"Oh he's really good with her, I mean he was away like to he went to prison to so he was gone for a little like not that long like two years a year year and a half.

So that's how it feels to me he swears to God that's not how it is, but you know, like that gut feeling you get like. Okay, just feel that way. yeah. I mean, I know he loves me. But he's just more like a let's hang out and what you know, and he just got out like I get it, you know. And like he had trauma to like he had his mom both his grandma died when he was in there, you know. And like he hasn't even started dealing with that and I don't even know how to help him do you know I mean cuz i've had that i've had friends die and stuff that were close to me like kill themselves and stuff but I haven't had like my mom and my dad I you know. I don't I don't know that kind of you know I don't even know how we even when he brings it up, I don't even know what to say. You know it's like that's such a horrible thing to have to go through, I don't know."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. So how do you guys manage that, when he. brings that up."
2751.0,Patient,"Here, he rarely Does he really does what he does he doesn't like to keep it kind of jokes you know.

And then, then he was, like all too soon, like that, like he turns it into like a joke kind of you know I know it can't like he was mama's boy, you know, like in he, like didn't really mean here like it to say goodbye no she isn't there so."
527.0,Provider,sure.

527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah in Eden, what Kim it's all right, just to say you know i'm not even sure what to say right now, like. I can't imagine what what it's been like for you, or what it's like for you. But if you want to talk about it, we can you know I can certainly listen and I want to you know I want to be an ear, if you need it or. You know, maybe trying to get himself connected with a therapist to be able to. You know, probably wouldn't hurt you know for him to process the last few years of his you know. What he's experienced you know so that you guys all have a place that you're able to process, you know different emotions and things that have happened and. You know, be able to figure out, you know how do we do life as a family like what has to be in place for all of us to to come together and understand each other and support each other, and you know communicate and. yeah yeah yeah."
2751.0,Patient,So i'm like i'm like get off like work and I hadn't done working out like come home and like make dinner and all eat dinner.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2751.0,Patient,"I got a call all eat dinner together and then like in like laughing and watch TV and those kinds of things like like it's like right now, it is how like growing up music, we all ate dinner in a separate room, you know play."
527.0,Provider,"Okay. Really yeah yeah so let's start here with some homework then Kim let's start, first of all, what are we going to do for you as far as working on self care and helping improve some of the depression symptoms like where do you feel like you can commit to some follow through for yourself."
2751.0,Patient,"I don't know I think I need to get out of the House really I haven't been working because I got sick and then now it's like i'm specially better, but I feel depressed who so it's like I have no motivation, right now, you know."
527.0,Provider,"Right and i'm wondering if you know what would it be like just even take care of yourself like. brush your teeth. Take a shower do your like sometimes that may be all that you get done but you're doing it for years, you know. yeah to challenge that that motivation and that, in the depression like is that something you feel like you can make a commitment to yourself to put Clean Clothes take a shower put Clean Clothes on each day. yeah or every other day, you know clothes, every day, you know I don't know how often you take a shower if it's."
2751.0,Patient,"Day, one that will not depressed yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you know, maybe the goal is over the next week or so i'm going to take a shower Clean Clothes on every day, and you know. Do my you know do my hair, so that you know I recognize that i'm taking care of myself today or more, whatever it is, you know, and if there's something. You know, you want to do, in addition to that, then great like add to that for yourself, but you know if that's all the energy, you can do is to get up get out of bed, you know, take a shower and get dressed for the day, then. You know that may that's a starting place. You know of not laying in bed all day. And then, and then I want you to also think about like. Maybe even thinking about what are some things that. that you would like to be able to work on in therapy like topics that you know we're going to be challenging but I want to work on these goals for myself whether that's obviously we know the trauma work but. You know I want to work on anxiety coping skills score I want to work on. You know communication skills and went to work on building my self esteem. If there's you know if you can come up with some things that you want to work on. And then you know i'm thinking to when you said feel like what do you want the family structure to look like at home for you, you know, and how can we work on. Implementing that because I think that would be a good place to begin kind of molding the family stuff for you to like an end would probably help all of you, maybe feel a little bit better."
2751.0,Patient,You know yeah.
527.0,Provider,"and have some time. have some family time whether that's you know we we make it a priority that we eat dinner together like that is. Like if that's where you want to start then okay let's figure out how to implement that in your families, so that you know at dinner, we all sit down this is how it's going to work. You know, everybody helps kind of participate, you know even the little one can you know, maybe she can get you know the napkins. For the table, you know things like that or. Put the salt and pepper shakers on the table, you know, make sure it's you know we get everybody kind of involved in that process to. make it more enjoyable and change up some of it, you know, or we have family game night once a week, you know after dinner or something or we all. Help clean up you know, do the do we have chores and stuff we all help you know, do the dishes or you know throw throw take the trash out or whatever after dinners you know things like that that you know we can maybe think about that might help. You know and help you feel more confident as a mom to."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and i'm putting pressure on my mom because I, my mom's you know. Taking taking like a school or you know there were over there after school or you know that's putting more pressure on my mom she doesn't do be doing all the things that she has way more than she showed, you know."
527.0,Provider,sure. yeah yeah so it does that feel like a good kind of starting point. isn't too much.
2751.0,Patient,I don't want to know because I also don't want to like.
527.0,Provider,"bombard you with a lot of things to like we can you know if you only get two of those goals done over the next week or so, then that's Okay, too, but. that's just."
2751.0,Patient,"Because, quite. Oh yeah I wanna I don't want to just be lazy and not you know. I want to. Change, I really want to change that you really want to."
