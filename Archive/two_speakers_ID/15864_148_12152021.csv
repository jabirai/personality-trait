148.0,Provider,"What I think you do, but I think you're using it against you right now."
15864.0,Patient,Why would I do something like that.
148.0,Provider,I don't think it's intentional. Did you check out the documentary I recommended.
15864.0,Patient,I try to get on. I. can't figure out how to get on netflix. But I researched it on online. And the only thing I came up with is like. Secret love. Something like that.
148.0,Provider,speaker love know. The secret. It talks about the power of our thoughts and how our thoughts create our reality. Have you ever heard of the law of attraction.
15864.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
148.0,Provider,Have you ever heard of the law of attraction.
15864.0,Patient,know.
148.0,Provider,Like what we put out it's what we receive type of thing.
15864.0,Patient,So you think i'm putting out all this sadness and that's what i'm receiving.
148.0,Provider,"um. Well, I feel like there's a lot of. pain. you're holding on to a lot of pain, which is causing a lot of. Negative thoughts inside of you. And i'm just wondering how to break through this breakthrough this wall that could potentially be holding you back. i'm not saying the circumstances are going to change like that, like you have a positive thought and everything's going to be exactly how you want it to be right. it's just, we have to figure out how to get you past this and into a more positive state, so we can have you attracting more positive things. Even if it's just a friend. Right."
15864.0,Patient,"yeah yes. I was never like this actually never. I mean, even when I would be sad or depressed I just pushed those feelings aside and. Just make people happy, you know always cracking jokes and. Doing silly stupid things. Just feel like all that was taken from me."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm mm hmm. And I don't want you to suppress your feelings I don't want you to not feel what you feel. But I do feel like changing a lot of the thoughts could help to manage the emotions. Because right now the only thing that you're feeling is pain.
15864.0,Patient,Though I lost my first brother. he's like a father Nice.
148.0,Provider,How did it feel talking about grief yesterday in group.
15864.0,Patient,To. jump off a roof.
148.0,Provider,It wasn't helpful at all to hear how somebody else handles their grief. And loss.
15864.0,Patient,"Is. hear someone else. else's pain. Alright, but I. couldn't relate. And i'm not trying to say you know his feelings and his thoughts. You know right thing for him, he shared his failings and his thoughts. And i'm not trying to say that i'm higher than he is there anything. Maybe if I were to last just one person, it might have been easier. I can't get over the fact of loser six people in less than a year I just can't get over that."
148.0,Provider,yeah that's a tremendous amount of loss.
15864.0,Patient,Maybe maybe you try to deal with one but there's so many more there it just all bundled up.
148.0,Provider,mm hmm. Do you want to process anything around any of those losses.

148.0,Provider,It sounds like she would have just been in pain longer. and pain and suffering. What do you think she would say to you now today if she could see how much pain year and.
15864.0,Patient,"He would. probably say Margie because so she always called me her Margie. don't be sad be happy. Go on, with life, be the person I am. Happy go lucky person. I would tell. You. I don't know if I can do it. He wanted me to find somebody else and. not going to happen."
