7368.0,Patient,"To be honest with my dad I I feel like it's relief that he he passed away. Because I had a little worries about taking care of him when he got too old to take care of himself. I don't know if that sounds cruel or not, but."
252.0,Provider,Not at all.
7368.0,Patient,I already took care of one parent. You know and. watched her slowly slip away and I just I I think that's why I distance myself from my dad so much I didn't. want to go through that again.
252.0,Provider,"yeah that's not exactly something that's fun first off, you know and there's like very little there's no family members around you. know that can like relieve you and and take over and give you breaks and no, no, I didn't."

7368.0,Patient,"that's that's my feeling. I think. My dad was supposed to go before my brother, because he couldn't have handled losing on to it, it would have broken him completely and he was already in not in a good place."
252.0,Provider,"Well, so now you have. The rest of your life to figure out what is best for Jennifer."

252.0,Provider,Now.
7368.0,Patient,it's a relief and at the same time it's like I I feel lost no.
252.0,Provider,yeah and the great part about it is that you get to take one step at a time and realize that it's about Jennifer. it's not about anybody else anymore. If you don't work.
7368.0,Patient,"For me, because I have like a serious caregiver complex."
252.0,Provider,uh huh i'm.
7368.0,Patient,"always taking care of people that's. I now I don't have anyone. Oh, but you do the printing on me."
252.0,Provider,"What you do the one person that you have put at the back burner is now up front end in your face saying it is my turn. And that. is amazing. Because what I know is, on the other side of all this when you start feeling, you know, having more days feeling Okay, then feeling not. you're going to realize. That you're worth it to, and it is time for you."
7368.0,Patient,"My um my psych high interest. I had an hour long appointment with him and he said, you know I need to forgive myself, and then I told them that you and I had talked quite a bit about that. He told me to make a collage basically have a bunch of pictures of me when I was a kid which I can now find. and Look at that little girl, and remember that the mistakes that the adult made the little girl was you know. wasn't in control of. And I started out innocent I need to. let go of. Everything i've done all the guilt."
252.0,Provider,"You do. It doesn't do you any good at this point, you know, a spike or never does really good, but especially from this point forward. It was happened has happened in the past, you cannot change it. But. learn from it and move forward. become the best version of Jennifer that there is self love so forth, people say that all the time and for a long time, I was like. I don't know how. To love anybody else you know to love myself."
7368.0,Patient,or I.
252.0,Provider,don't have somebody else.
7368.0,Patient,"Or how do you love anyone else, when you can't love yourself."
252.0,Provider,"This is your journey. This is all about, you know. And you'll get to a point where where. you'll be okay with that. Right, because all of the all of the her all of the pain, all of the worry all the caretaking. You did out of love. Now it's time for you to do it for yourself. You know. there's you know there's you know a lot of pain with loss definitely, but there is also, in your situation, a lot of."
7368.0,Patient,relief. and freedom yeah.
252.0,Provider,That you now have that you didn't have or haven't had. You know what all. You to experience the things that you've thought about.
7368.0,Patient,It is terrifying.
252.0,Provider,"it's like what do I want to do. Right, where do I want to go."
7368.0,Patient,i'm already a horrible decision maker. it's a. i'm either end of indecisive or it feel like I make the wrong decision.
252.0,Provider,"I haven't seen it lately. want to tell you that. I haven't. You know you, the first thing that you were worried about was you know the House and making sure the House was secure and your dad's you know situation and getting everything in order for your dad there's no wrong decision making in that."
7368.0,Patient,it's true.
252.0,Provider,"you're able to see with clarity. things about kyle that were you know that weren't right, let us get some. growing up to do. What I know is that sometimes getting out of a situation that isn't healthy for us can feel like a huge mess. You know. yeah but what did you do. It. Right, you did it anyway and that's all we can do is just move on forward every day. that's all we got no. that's what I know. You get to you know springtime with you and he'll. You know, and like that, like your psychiatry said it's about forgiveness for you. it's time. Give yourself permission to grieve you give yourself walk you know the permission to walk through your feelings and to get to the other side of them and to explore and examine and forgive and feel joy. And quit beating yourself up from past mistakes that. are done and over with. You know. And here's here's something else, because now, you know everything is it's Jennifer right and you're going to stay in your in your dad's house."
7368.0,Patient,"yeah i'm saying here i've got. i've got to get the plumbing fixed and the guest bathroom. I need to get the House recited. there's some plumbing issues in the kitchen that need fixed. I just I don't know where to start how to get estimates, who to talk to all of that is just. it's a big confusing must have me."
252.0,Provider,I say.
7368.0,Patient,"The cleaning the House out there's so much stuff like again. My friend mikey comes over and helps clean but moving big things oh and doing all of that it's going to take a crew of people. yeah and. i've had a couple people offer to help. me it's just a matter of. them having the time to do it. Like jamie's offered to help, but she works 60 to 70 hours a week. You know her days offers been taking care of her eight cats and four dog or five dogs and the House, you know that that she's trying to keep going. So it's just. yeah I feel overwhelmed still."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you take it one day at a time, right now, as it sits there's no rush. there's nothing pressing about it. you're going to be there, you can do it a little bit at a time and not push yourself and feel overwhelmed you have to just keep telling yourself there's no timeline here. there's no timeline. it's okay."
7368.0,Patient,"i've always been really bad about that setting a limit, like, I would like to have it all done within a year, and my friends like you know realistically it's going to take you like five years to get through everything that's in that house."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Just do one bedroom one room at a time. When you have time, not even making it a you know, a pressing priority at this point, give yourself time you know you've had a overload an enormous amount of responsibility thrown on your shoulders lately give yourself time to breathe too."
7368.0,Patient,"But at the same time, I feel like if i'm not doing something i'm wasting time."
252.0,Provider,"This time. Right who's time. Again, remembering this is just about you this isn't about anybody else anymore."
7368.0,Patient,"Like my dad did, and what a. pile up on me."
252.0,Provider,I don't think you're gonna have a feeling you're not. But we're talking. weeks. we're talking weeks. we're not even talking years we're not even talking really a whole lot of months. we're talking weeks. itself a little bit of time right now. You know. You don't feel if you want to netflix it for damon net netflix it for a day.
7368.0,Patient,hard for me to sit still.
252.0,Provider,"don't work in your garden. Do the things that are healthy for you. yeah what a healing comes going and hanging out with Jamie nouns. doing things for you. You know. And I don't know about your area, but I know in my area when when you get ready for a lot of. Big things to be moved out of there."
7368.0,Patient,"There yeah I was told that the city has one day a month or something like that that they move big things. I just gotta move it out to the street, I need to contact them and find out what day, that is. Because that would be a big help."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so. very, very much so."
7368.0,Patient,"it's just deciding what goes, first, I mean there's."
252.0,Provider,"I, I would also, if you have the money, I would get a big dumb certain set of. Air hard you know and just start with things that can go in the dumpster just start there. You know, then you feel like you're accomplishing something to. And you're not sitting in it."
7368.0,Patient,I should be reading a checklist the one talking to you.
252.0,Provider,that's what I would do and what works best for me is just doing one area at a time. Not taking the whole House on at once.
7368.0,Patient,"i'm gonna start honestly with my dad's room. that's going to be the hardest, but I mean I would rather get the hardest out of the way first."
252.0,Provider,"And you'll have somebody with you, while you're doing it."
7368.0,Patient,Most of the time. I can't say I will all the time.
252.0,Provider,"Well there's going to be times, where you're not going to want anybody there, so you have to take that time for you to. Maybe that'll give you. The closure that you need. Maybe it'll help you find forgiveness. You know."
7368.0,Patient,"The hardest part of it, for me, is just. I know how tightly he held on to everything, and I feel like. and i'm dishonoring him or something by getting rid of things that you would have kept, even though the you know I can't possibly donate them or you know they're they're damaged or whatever. there's only so much that other people will even want. To. Just."
252.0,Provider,Get rid of it.
7368.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know what I mean it's about freshness it's about healing and part of that is cleaning out and get rid of things that you know, should have gone on the drudge a long time ago that you know."
7368.0,Patient,"Whether it's you're always millions of times already, and he went and."
252.0,Provider,got it out. yeah. Very much so.
7368.0,Patient,"I mean i've done a little bit here and there, but."
252.0,Provider,"This is going to take time and and take the time that you need for it there's no nothing that's pressing that says it has to be done this week or next month. You just take it as it comes when you feel, and you have the energy to go in there and do a little bit go in and do a little bit when the energy is gone and it sapped out of you, because emotions will do that. Give yourself permission to say okay that's enough for today. You know."
7368.0,Patient,"definitely do want to rent a toaster, though, because I think that'll help you know I don't have to rush all in one day to try to get a whole bunch together because I finally have helped it'll just be there."
252.0,Provider,"yep exactly what I would do. And then it does kind of grew you know you'll be able to actually see the progress that you're making and not feel like that. You know. This isn't about this isn't about anybody else anymore, but you and letting go and forgiving. More walking through it. You know your dad. He doesn't have to worry about those things anymore. What he could do with this, or what he could have done without a word he could have done this, you know what I mean. it's time. For complete clear out. My my eyes feel like they're almost one shot."
7368.0,Patient,How are you feeling another.
252.0,Provider,Just my sinus.
7368.0,Patient,or but.
252.0,Provider,uh huh.
7368.0,Patient,You sound a little bit better than you did yesterday but.

252.0,Provider,"Just the last couple days, actually, and on top of it yesterday, I went and took my. My second covert shot."

252.0,Provider,yeah and the second shot.
7368.0,Patient,I wasn't my teens.
252.0,Provider,"I was thinking that I was going to be really sick and you know and but then I I mentally made myself prepared and said, you are not going to get sick from us you're not gonna."
7368.0,Patient,So the first shot all it did was make my arm hurts really bad it. Just sucker punched me over and over again. It was like a permanent charley horse on my arm.
252.0,Provider,"And that's what it feels like in my arm today. But I did it night I. yeah I struggle with it, but."
7368.0,Patient,"strongly motivated when one of my dad's friends just passed away because of coated. So you know with my dad going in the hospital with it, and you know I know I had it already once and I was Okay, but there's different strains now coming out of Africa so. ED definitely think that getting the booster at least as a good idea."
252.0,Provider,"yeah very much so, and so yep yesterday was my second shot and I totally. Because I already had sinus the sinus thing going on, and so I was just like nope i'm not going to own any sickness from a stupid shot. The upgrade. If you happen you're not going to happen i'm not going to recognize it. And I didn't I didn't get sick, I have not saved other than the signs ended up had for."
7368.0,Patient,"And I think that's going around it's kind of a cold that's going around because I was in the pharmacy the other day picking up a prescription on a bunch of people were. Having sinus problems and then last week I did. And just dumping green. Everywhere everywhere, it was terrible."
252.0,Provider,You know what to say you know it's a sinus some type of sinus.

252.0,Provider,"ain't getting sick to you know Sunday to Sunday was the worst I just could not I couldn't even get out I couldn't keep my eyes open. it's like, can you imagine if I was sitting in here with somebody and they're telling me."
7368.0,Patient,tanya deep. dark secret or something and you're half asleep.
252.0,Provider,That is not.
7368.0,Patient,not good.
252.0,Provider,"You know what I mean, so I thought I called in on Sunday and said I just I slept all day I need to sleep. My body's fighting something horrible I feel it. So."
7368.0,Patient,We only don't time. We get sick.
252.0,Provider,"that's really true, we all need time to take care of ourselves, remember that."
7368.0,Patient,"that's easy for me to say, the other view."
252.0,Provider,"isn't that crazy how that works, we can tell other people. Right, we know what they need because we're caretakers. Now it's time to care take for you. And I like what you've been doing so far."
7368.0,Patient,Thank you.
252.0,Provider,"So just keep doing it take the time for you. he'll Jennifer let go of that big baggage that you're holding because it's not it's not helping in any way, shape or form. The past is gone and it's not coming back. And there's no reason to hold on to it. Forgive yourself, for whatever it was."
7368.0,Patient,"I think God every day for getting silver because I don't think i'd be doing half as well, right now, so we're."
252.0,Provider,that's really true. You know i'm.
7368.0,Patient,"goals, or whatever you know."
252.0,Provider,Staying high or staying numb let's say num num.
7368.0,Patient,It really makes the pain worse.
252.0,Provider,"It amplifies Yes it completely amplifies the feelings that we're going to or numbs it to the point that, when you do come down a little bit it's amplified. And it really kind of stops the process from from happening and you're sober you're walking through the process. And I just think that you're going to feel 100 times better at the end of it. you're going to come to this place realize that you've forgiven yourself you've let go of things that you shouldn't have been holding on to anyways. and your self care is going to be stellar you're going to feel great. I just think that that is what is in store for you. Because that's exactly what you deserve. you're a good person, you have to remember that deserve to be loved you deserve to be loved, especially by you. that's my belief. So, what are your plans for today."
