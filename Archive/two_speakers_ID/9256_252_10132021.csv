252.0,Provider,Are you but.
9256.0,Patient,"Well, for know for my brain. what's going on with every neurological problem. Where my brains not telling my body to do certain life support tasks like heart beating and breathing and stuff like that."
252.0,Provider,And wow.

9256.0,Patient,April 2022 2022 i'm sorry.
252.0,Provider,holy crap.
9256.0,Patient,"So I just have to wait because i've still been passing out. Because I stopped breathing. yeah and I don't realize that i'm not breathing because it's supposed to be automatic. hmm but it's a. So it's that's one thing that's bothering me, but nothing I can do about it, you know, a medical condition. yeah but. Still can't drive and the neurologist says i'm probably will never be able to try. He won't because there's no cure for auto auto not make dyslexia."
252.0,Provider,wow.
9256.0,Patient,"Whatever that is. I had never heard of it. Neither but but but it's from a spine injury, which I have had. And i've had spine surgeries. Right at the base of my neck. we're we're all the wiring and running through. And all the nerves and. they're working on that will kind of. swimming and my foot is 99% better. Good got all the pins out got all the well, not all the pins but the ones that they were supposed to take out. got those taken out saw him yesterday everything's looking better. that's good, and I feel pretty good."
252.0,Provider,Good that's good.
9256.0,Patient,I feel fine. slips been a little disrupted.
252.0,Provider,Were because of the new information about what.
9256.0,Patient,I just got off of my sleep. patterns and ended up staying up one night all night and that just messed me up.
252.0,Provider,it's hard to get back on schedule.
9256.0,Patient,"it's hard to get back on schedule, so I was asleep by six o'clock last night. And that's never good for me, because then I wake up at two o'clock in the morning and i'm up the rest of the night."
252.0,Provider,Oh wow.
9256.0,Patient,what's that.
252.0,Provider,What time you wake up this morning.
9256.0,Patient,About two.
252.0,Provider,So how are you going to correct that.
9256.0,Patient,"i'm going to try to stay up as late as I can today tonight. and see if I can get back into the my normal ups, I had a pretty good routine going until I stayed up all night. And that just."
252.0,Provider,I just stay up all night.
9256.0,Patient,"Oh, I was waiting for my wife to come home. So we went out on a boat. Saturday afternoon, and then I didn't hear from her until Sunday around nine o'clock in the morning. She was supposed to come back Saturday night but they're both got stuck in the mud."
252.0,Provider,Oh wow.
9256.0,Patient,"Well, they were stuck all night in the San Francisco bay."
252.0,Provider,Oh no.
9256.0,Patient,"yeah so I was up waiting for her, as I told her i'd wait up for but I didn't know it's gonna be the next day."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9256.0,Patient,and her phone died.
252.0,Provider,which makes it worse.
9256.0,Patient,So I didn't even get a message from her until the next morning.
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh yeah you were worried."
9256.0,Patient,"worried and I was just waiting up men. watching YouTube online. So so that's throughout my whole sleep schedule. So i'm working on getting that back together, so I think that might be why i'm a little depressed this week. um. I mean not like. suicidal depressed but just kinda blah. blah yeah."
252.0,Provider,"yeah probably is you know when our sleep schedules off kilter and our schedule gets kind of messed up then that's exactly what happens, we get emotionally drained you know. Right um. And we do we're either super inches or we are super depressed and what you know."
9256.0,Patient,"What to have a little of both but i'd say more anxious than depressed but I haven't been really depressed lately, except for this last few days."
252.0,Provider,yeah that's what I would think what are you doing for your anxiety.
9256.0,Patient,Nothing. meditation. tikkun been trying a little grounding. extraction. breathing.
252.0,Provider,abdominal breathing.
9256.0,Patient,"abdominal or four count breathing. Actually, the breathing has been probably the biggest help to calm me down yeah. Other than anything else."
252.0,Provider,"And don't forget about the self top don't forget about what you're telling yourself and your brain right. If you are, you know if they are anxiety producing thoughts than they are going to push that anxiety higher and so you've got to make sure that those thoughts that are going on, while you're trying to calm yourself down, are you know positive calming statements. Right, you know that's hugely important."
9256.0,Patient,"I haven't quite got there yet. As far as. My thoughts, because they start to race. And then the only thing that brings me back from that is meditation. yeah because I can refocus. But. At the time. Sometimes, not as easy. it's easier to do it after the fact, or before during an attacker even just when my mind just starts to race. it's a lot harder to think of the coping skills. yeah at that moment."
252.0,Provider,"It is in the very beginning, though, if you. If you could start at least trying right in the very beginning, when you first start noticing anything happening that your anxieties headed That way, you know really kind of telling yourself what are you freaking out about everything is okay. Read. that's right read. Everything is okay you're Okay, you know, and those are the types of messages that you want to send to your body not. You know the other ones where your mind is going on, you can't you got to do it, the very beginning, not as your mind starts racing because once it starts you're right, it is hard to get it."
9256.0,Patient,Once it starts it's. it's really hard to use a coping skill.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
9256.0,Patient,"And I agree, if I can catch it early. Before it snowballs."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
9256.0,Patient,"And, before I start going down the rabbit hole. If I like to see if I can catch it in the beginning, then I can usually talk myself out of whatever i'm bad i'm thinking or. I start thinking better thoughts. And when I say bad thoughts I mean should I want to go isolate myself yeah and hide."
252.0,Provider,"Excuse me, I want to see. Even thoughts that are like oh God, here it comes again Oh, you know what I mean those are even even those types of thoughts or anxiety producing thoughts and what IFS."
9256.0,Patient,Right i'm good at that.
252.0,Provider,"know what if what if sin even be in our vocabulary, or what it should have goodness."
9256.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,because those are anxiety producing and depressive producing. words.
9256.0,Patient,This i'm good at what it could have should have. i'm really good at that.
252.0,Provider,"We don't even recognize, you know at first. That they cause anxiety to spike or depression to spike we have no idea that that's what's happening, but again as you're learning, you know with everything is going on with your brain that there is powerful. So you think about it, your brain right now isn't sending messages for you to breathe and do the basic life functions. Right right, and so you have to intentionally. Tell your brain, you know to change those what ifs, what if are no good no bueno those they have to be out of your you know."
9256.0,Patient,Out of vocabulary.
252.0,Provider,"yeah totally because they will cause your anxiety to go. You know, through the roof big time. So you just got to you know work on in the very beginning."
9256.0,Patient,Right so try to catch it early. that's. Or if I talked to my. psychiatrist she says don't try to catch it early do catch it early. She already pulled try out of my vocabulary too so i'm losing i'm losing all these words.
252.0,Provider,I love that.
9256.0,Patient,So that's what i'm working on. Good um and I know what i'm. supposed to do. it's just a matter of doing it.
252.0,Provider,it's a matter of putting it in practice.
9256.0,Patient,"Right, but I have a pretty good idea of. The coping skills that helped me. it's just activated them at the right times."
252.0,Provider,Yes. And you got to remember to that you're not going to do it perfect at first and that's okay. If I.
9256.0,Patient,But it's been a long time. I mean i've been practicing for years seems like. At least 10 years. worth of. therapy or some sort of. Help yeah.
252.0,Provider,You think of how long you think of how long you've been working in with those with those thoughts How long have you been working with you know.
9256.0,Patient,"Your whole life, yes yeah so it's gonna take some time to reverse it."
252.0,Provider,very much.
9256.0,Patient,or think about it differently.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, what if. And those two words together. No good."
9256.0,Patient,No good so that's another word and last.
252.0,Provider,"But you know separately they're fine. But remember that you, you know your body is sending messages or your mind is sending messages to your body. And it makes perfect sense that, if you have got negative self talk going on it's sending those messages to your body and your body's responding to that."
9256.0,Patient,"Okay. I mean, I understand."
252.0,Provider,Like when you think about when you first when your anxiety for starts spiking is it what are the very first symptoms that you start getting sweaty palms. racing heart.
9256.0,Patient,racing heart and I get this like feeling in my stomach. That. I just feel like physically nauseous.
252.0,Provider,"And so, in those."
9256.0,Patient,Start sweating.
252.0,Provider,"In those beginning stages right that's when you when those coping statements, need to be in place."
9256.0,Patient,"And that's usually, when I freak out the most."
252.0,Provider,In the very beginning.
9256.0,Patient,Is in the very beginning.
252.0,Provider,And that's what it has to be worked on. Right you gotta say whoa whoa slow down. Your okay.
9256.0,Patient,Gary all right yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah right i'm gonna be okay i'm safe there's nothing wrong right now breathe, you know, so you change those those beginning thoughts any again practice."
9256.0,Patient,"Practice yeah. And I have been for the most part. I mean the coping skills have been working like I say when I can remember. Right and and you're right, it is getting like easier to meditate. The more practice yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so, the more you practice, the more it will be a go to. write the more you have, the more you go to your safe place it'll be a go to right. You have to remember that."
9256.0,Patient,"where's my safe place. In my head you mean. yeah yeah. Well that's um. It all makes sense. And it sounds good, I just have to practice."
252.0,Provider,just have to practice yeah. that's the thing.
9256.0,Patient,"Okay, I could work on that."
252.0,Provider,"Little at a time, you know what I mean just try little don't beat yourself up if you don't get a perfect nobody does for a while until they continually. Work on it, and then it becomes that go to you, then you know what's happening, the very beginning, and you can start that process, and one thing about the anxiety symptoms, you know the physical symptoms that come with anxiety is knowing that you're not going to die from them. Knowing. right will pass. Knowing that they will pass."
9256.0,Patient,They always do.
252.0,Provider,"They always do there's always an ending. So, remembering that and telling yourself that right it's going to pass and will read."
9256.0,Patient,"I know there's always an ending. i'm worried, the ending is i'm going to end up in the er. And that all that makes the anxiety worse. So I need to work on that. Nothing bad's gonna happen. I need to keep telling myself that."
252.0,Provider,Very much so.
9256.0,Patient,Because I don't end up in the er. again. that's never fun.
252.0,Provider,"No it's never fun right. And so you've got to start practicing first you gotta you know know what coping skills help calm you down and you've got to practice those coping skills before the onset of any symptoms right. And right for symptoms come on whether they're sweaty hands or whether they're you know your heart starts racing that's when you begin to you know what are you freaking out of a talk to, I talked to my heart. You know when it starts palpitating really hard not. yeah I can feel that anxiety coming on i'm like. slow down."
9256.0,Patient,Well yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know, and it it's amazing how it listens."
9256.0,Patient,"And then yeah and sometimes i'm just worried my heart's going to stop beating. Complete. And then, when that happens, I pass out. And fall on my face and. fall on my head. And fall in my neck and break my nose and."
252.0,Provider,All of that.
9256.0,Patient,Because i've just fall. out of the blue. there's my heart decides to stop beating or I stopped breathing.
252.0,Provider,Do they want you to walk with a Walker something just I.
9256.0,Patient,became. i'm supposed to use a walk around the House. i'm supposed to.
252.0,Provider,But you don't.
9256.0,Patient,I tried to. If if my wife had her way of Walker would be attached to me because she's always mad at me because i'm not using the Walker and I know I should be.
252.0,Provider,The one to see.
9256.0,Patient,didn't want me to fall and cracked my head open again.
252.0,Provider,To say.
9256.0,Patient,"And so, those are added on to the. To the anxiety and depression, I have. For him out."
252.0,Provider,"Falling right, and so in that very first moment when you feel it coming on part of what you should be doing is sitting."
9256.0,Patient,"Oh, I I private. But it comes on so fast. That I fall like a sack of potatoes and. instantly without putting my hands out or anything just collapse, for a second. Just long enough to fall. Now, since they put in the pacemaker. That has helped a lot. I probably only pass out once a month, instead of once a week. But it's still not ideal, because sometimes I just don't breathe and I don't realize i'm not breathing. So the anxiety doesn't help that at all."
252.0,Provider,"No, it doesn't. And that's why we practice, all these things around the anxiety, so that you have those tools."
9256.0,Patient,Right right.
252.0,Provider,Meaning you know and as far as your heart stopping and you know stopping breathing you've just got to work within the realms that you have in that moment.
9256.0,Patient,You know right.
252.0,Provider,Until you can get into see that doctor that's crazy it's not till April.
9256.0,Patient,"I know I couldn't believe it well, now that they are going to try to get me in sooner someone cancels are. So hopefully. I get a little sooner sooner than later, but it's the one specialist. In. All of California, who deals with specifically this problem."
252.0,Provider,wow one person. Unbelievable.
9256.0,Patient,"yeah. But he's supposed to be good. And he's supposed to know what he's doing and. So. i'm willing to wait. Well, I don't have a choice. But i'm not going to give up."
252.0,Provider,Good.
9256.0,Patient,"i'm going to keep plugging along and doing what i'm doing. and Then, trying to avoid crowds, even though the month of september's was a bad for crowds just had a lot going on. picnics and barbecues and parties and. September was a busy month. So October has been better. November i'm going out of town. For thanksgiving."
252.0,Provider,awesome way going.
9256.0,Patient,Las Vegas.
252.0,Provider,cool.
9256.0,Patient,To get away from family mostly.
252.0,Provider,your wife.
9256.0,Patient,"yeah because all the families all want to have thanksgiving at their house. And so we end up going to three different houses and it's just a pain in the button I don't want to see the family anyway. yeah so I said let's just go and we've done it before. we've actually gone to Vegas for thanksgiving. Right a bunch of times actually we haven't been the last five years, maybe. So I said let's just go. So we're gonna spend that week the whole week hiding. That yeah. You together now, I just have to deal with the people in Vegas. Which is a little easier because they're all strangers. And I don't care as much what they think."
252.0,Provider,Because I don't.
9256.0,Patient,know them.
252.0,Provider,"yeah, which is good. that's a horrible frozen picture, did you see that."
9256.0,Patient,I look down for a second.
252.0,Provider,I was frozen laughing. Looked horrible.
9256.0,Patient,"Or at least the video is working, this time. Right every time it's freezes up."
252.0,Provider,"I know I don't know what is up with the Internet, it feels like you know the last couple months ago Internet has just been wonky."
9256.0,Patient,What tickets because it's overused to yeah. everybody's on it.
252.0,Provider,got a point when.
9256.0,Patient,People are working from it and. Like you.
252.0,Provider,"yeah like me. Definitely, so that is your plans for the next couple months. Right. and your psychiatrist will tell you the same thing right take try out of I love that i'm going to start using that."
9256.0,Patient,To take. Take try out change it to do.
252.0,Provider,yeah in key and get whatever make it gone.
9256.0,Patient,Over have it written down right here. I am in control. Do not try to. and
252.0,Provider,Do.
9256.0,Patient,It seems to help. yeah every time i'm gonna say i'm all try to do it. i'll do it.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm that's a commitment.
9256.0,Patient,Right yeah and I I like that I think I need focus sometimes.
252.0,Provider,"yeah because if you keep saying I try i'll try i'll try, then that gives you the option opportunity to procrastinate."
9256.0,Patient,or yeah.
252.0,Provider,Right.
9256.0,Patient,or i'll try to up didn't work.
252.0,Provider,"yeah I tried it then didn't work. But you've got to keep trying it's like riding a bike keep trying right until you get it, you tell you can take the training wheels off."
9256.0,Patient,"Okay, that makes sense yeah. But. also use the training wheels as a crutch. To not try."
252.0,Provider,yeah you can.
9256.0,Patient,And I think I tend to do that. Is. I lose focus and then I just give up.
252.0,Provider,"yeah and what happens, a lot of times is that people will try it once or twice and get flustered. Right and get you to do okay so you've got to say stop. breathe. breathing is the number one thing abdominal breathing is one of the."
9256.0,Patient,moment it seems to hold me down the most yes or the quickest.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm. And with hormonal breathing you've. got to change those thoughts you've got to.
9256.0,Patient,that's the problem.
252.0,Provider,"So when you find a way to practice it before the onset of it is, it is when you find yourself thinking negatively find yourself in the what IFS you got to say oh. I have to stop right now, I have to get out of the what ifs and get in the present moment. Because when you go into those what ifs, you are, you are, you know you're not even realizing it, but your brain is increasing the potential for that anxiety to come right on. Right right if you're finding yourself some woulda shoulda coulda is same thing. You know I wish I would have done that I should have done this, I would you know, no, no, no, it is what it is it's happened is over, you can't change it."
9256.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,And that's what you tell yourself there's no water so to critters right let's.
9256.0,Patient,Just do it.
252.0,Provider,"Just do it. Then, and what you can input in place of a woulda shoulda coulda is. Next time, this is how i'm going to do it. And that stays out of the water should have put us."
9256.0,Patient,"Okay, this is gonna save that almost gives me an out. Next time."
252.0,Provider,Next time i'm going to do it this way.
9256.0,Patient,going to do it.
252.0,Provider,Now i'm going to try to do it.
9256.0,Patient,Right I can't try that's not a valid word anymore.
252.0,Provider,it's not you know that's a procrastinating word.
9256.0,Patient,yeah good or bad.
252.0,Provider,A lot of people are that struggle with anxiety.
9256.0,Patient,yeah because that's how i've dealt with it. All these years.
252.0,Provider,"yeah you stay out of us first off you kind of stay out of the realm of of having it come on. But. Then, when it does come on all of those fear based words are right in your head. which then push it even further higher. So what we want to do is to change those thoughts before it comes on So even if you still experiencing anxiety attack it's not going to be like extreme if you continue in continuing with those fear based words those fear based thoughts and your brain. Okay. The idea is to eventually be able to. resolve having anxiety attacks panic attacks right everybody life is stressful. period and we've got to be able to internally. sorted out. put on the table the things that are overwhelming and take them and bite sized chunks that were able to manage right that's the whole idea of. Coping skills is be able to manage. So we have to start breathing which you've already started meditation which you've already started."
9256.0,Patient,"readings good yes. meditation. i've also found that. When i'm really having problems with an issue or write it down. And that seems to help. If I can catch it early and just write down what is bothering me, even though maybe no one's going to ever read it. It helps get it out of my head."
252.0,Provider,Very much so.
9256.0,Patient,um so i've just started trying that a little more. Because I have some issues that are bothering me about how I left work and. There were never really resolved. yeah and. I don't think it's worth my energy trying to resolve them with the people that are involved. yeah So if I can write it out what i've started doing that about work and. It seems to help. We focus on it and.
252.0,Provider,That is not.
9256.0,Patient,letting it go.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm part of that is that ruminating about it. and
9256.0,Patient,i'm good at that.
252.0,Provider,Being in that what it should have could have stayed. Right it's already that chapters written you can't change any of it right so writing it down and taking a look at it.
9256.0,Patient,it's stuck in my mind. That I was that I was done wrong. and It. was hard to let go of.
252.0,Provider,It is.
9256.0,Patient,I mean I run I like to say ruminate my mind just starts racing I start thinking 50 different scenarios that how things could have been different.
252.0,Provider,But they're not.
9256.0,Patient,But they can't be different because they've already happened.
252.0,Provider,Exactly and that's what you've got to tell yourself.
9256.0,Patient,I can't I.
252.0,Provider,can't change that it's already written it's done but you also have to bring in the fact that you have this case to rectify that. Right.
9256.0,Patient,What do you mean.
252.0,Provider,aren't you working with a lawyer to.
9256.0,Patient,Read oh yeah no no legal case guests. And it's almost rectified. see that they're working on a settlement right now. Good as we speak.
252.0,Provider,Good and the hope is is when that's final when that's done that you can then let go of that.
9256.0,Patient,"That will be some sort of a closure. yeah no it's not. How I wanted to end my career. I would have rather ended on top. Sure, instead of so in my company. And then firing me. The best not I wanted to end 30 plus years of work. So so that's one of the things that really bothers me. So that's why I started writing it out."
252.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad you're writing it out, and you have to remember that that is hurt."
9256.0,Patient,"Oh, I feel hurt a lot. about how it all ended and that's why I keep thinking about it, and if I could have done something different. And I don't think I could have. Because it was a medical issue, the reason why I was fired."
252.0,Provider,Oh wow.
9256.0,Patient,"yeah it was the passing out and. I stopped the only symptoms, I would also get dizzy. I would also forget things. Are where they call it brain fog. that's one of the symptoms of this disease and so. Instead of them just accusing me of drinking on the job which i've never done. That they could have found out what was really wrong. Right just by asking me. And so the way that whole thing was handled just really because it destroyed my character, I mean. They were spreading rumors that weren't true and that just tears me up inside. So i'm that's one of the big things that i'm trying to get rid of."
252.0,Provider,Good is.
9256.0,Patient,How that all went down.
252.0,Provider,"Processing it writing it down. yeah when this case is over and there's closure in that aspect, I suggest that you take what you've written about it. uh huh and you burn it. allowing it to go, allowing it to be gone."
9256.0,Patient,"yeah. This is gone it's done. nothing I can do about it i'm. Like I said I could have dealt with the differently, I could have confronted it originally. um. But I just kind of let it slide. um. Other than that i'm doing great."
252.0,Provider,Definitely write it down.
9256.0,Patient,yeah no i'm saying i've already started. Think good um so so I used that as a coping skill.
252.0,Provider,"Good and you know that if they're in the settlement phase. You know just going into the settlement phase, states that they are you know they're owning."
9256.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. You know no i've already won the case it's just they're deciding. The financial part of it. And they I guess they made an offer. And my lawyer said no that's not even close to what we're looking at. So. I mean, I never had intended. On it on suing them."
252.0,Provider,Right.
9256.0,Patient,At the time. seemed like an option to end this whole thing.
252.0,Provider,"Sir, and putting. Think of it this way. A hacker putting 30 you know 30 years into that company. Right and then you know not getting the respect to even ask questions. And being right and. You are going to save the next person from going through that. You have to remember that this isn't not for a reason. Companies put policies and procedures in place, because these things need to be avoided, these things need to not happen."
9256.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,You know.
9256.0,Patient,And yeah Hopefully there will be some change right. yeah that i'm not even gonna worry about right now.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
9256.0,Patient,"This is, I have like said no control over it. what's done is done. Whether it was right or wrong. it's the damage has been done."
252.0,Provider,yeah and they're owning it you won the case.
9256.0,Patient,It right so. yeah that does make you feel a little better yeah but like I said that's just not how I wanted it to end. sure nobody does.
252.0,Provider,It hurt.
9256.0,Patient,"yeah it still hurts when it's been years or three years, two years."
252.0,Provider,"Sure unresolved, you know what I mean internally, as far as emotions go but. You know, when this case is closed and you've written out the whole scenario on piece of paper, and you can take it, and you can burn it I choose to let this go. You know, then. you'll feel better."
9256.0,Patient,"Right. You know I think Okay, I really like that idea of burning it yeah."
252.0,Provider,"yeah it's kind of a. it's like a commitment, stating that i'm going to let it go at this time, the case is closed, they own their part it's time to let it go, you know."
9256.0,Patient,Right and i've led a lot of it go there's still bits and pieces that are. You just. Keep cycling over and over.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, and so you know you think about a once the case is over, and you burn what you've written down if it comes up again, you have to tell yourself i've already letting that go. hey there's no reason in ruminating about it anymore. and pull yourself pull your thoughts away and out of it into something else."
9256.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,I need to focus on my granddaughter or I need to focus on my wife or San Francisco. I see me around anything.
9256.0,Patient,As emphasis go yes.
252.0,Provider,"And that's how we start working on controlling think about it that's how we practice working on controlling our thoughts. What can first question would be, what can I do about it right now. do I have any control to change the past. What can I control right now myself I thoughts I reactions. that's what I have. Control over."
9256.0,Patient,"That make sense. yeah no I understand the coping skills and I understand how everything works. And it is getting a little easier. To control and. So. i'm definitely working on it. going to group therapy. Every week. And then, I have a regular therapist that I see. Every week. Then I see you every couple of weeks."
252.0,Provider,"Man, you are just getting there for ties all those."
9256.0,Patient,Oh yeah I mean it's not for lack of trying. really what it's doing.
252.0,Provider,But it's doing. Right doing that trying out of there i'm not trying it.
9256.0,Patient,i'm doing it.
252.0,Provider,you're doing it. You practice.
9256.0,Patient,And it's practice. And i'm.
252.0,Provider,You can do it.
9256.0,Patient,yeah no i'm I can do it um it's just going to take time. yeah and. As long as I can make it through that the hard parts.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9256.0,Patient,i'll be fine.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, and don't forget about a grant you know, a gratitude to you know, making gratitude list when you find yourself sad. or wishing that you, you know, had something that you don't know wishing things were different in the past, you have to take a look at the themes that you have in your life today that are amazing so you shift that thought to that. Negative thinking to that positive thinking, I have an amazing wife. You know, we had roof over our head, we have food in our mouths we get to travel."
9256.0,Patient,We got.
252.0,Provider,These things that a lot of people don't. These are things i'm grateful for my life.
9256.0,Patient,it's um. yeah I like that idea. it's. For some reason it's easier to come up with the negatives other positive.
252.0,Provider,"Again that's part of training, your brain. Right right. Definitely and here's The funny part is once you start training your brain even. Once you know your brain you your go to as those positive thoughts when negative things comes up come up you'll say you'll start saying things. Well, you already do say this but well at least I have this, or at least I have that for at least I can do this right, that is way better, because that is taking that negative thought process and that negative situation and looking at. You know what you do have what you can do so that's taking it from the negative to the positive and you do that already. Yes. Okay, so. Knowing that you're already on your way."
9256.0,Patient,Were there.
252.0,Provider,Right you're already on your way. You can do it.
9256.0,Patient,OK. I will.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, you will."
9256.0,Patient,I can try.
252.0,Provider,You practice.
9256.0,Patient,"And I will work, which I have been practicing. not always successful but it's a star."
252.0,Provider,"Exactly you know, nobody is said that is going to be perfect every time we have to fail and fall down before we can get it always."
9256.0,Patient,yeah I mean I want something more magical.
252.0,Provider,It was.
9256.0,Patient,"I was hoping, like the medication would help but. I mean well, it does help but."
252.0,Provider,"Thanks, a lot of work."
9256.0,Patient,I wanted to be just just take a pill and. Everything will be perfect right. And i've come to the realization that that's never going to happen.
252.0,Provider,there's no pill for it.
9256.0,Patient,there's no pill there's no. Secret potions there's no nothing that will help. But the medications do help them realizing. Were before I didn't think they made any difference.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9256.0,Patient,"Until I stopped taking him yeah, then I ended up in the er and. Then you know the advert Ward and yeah. That was living hell. I never want to do that again, I never want to get to that point good. Was it does no good. What else is new."
252.0,Provider,"I think you got a lot of you know, good things going I think you've got. You know a lot of therapy, you have a lot of practicing you have a lot of positivity in your life, you have things that you know are just proceeding and going and it's me."
9256.0,Patient,i've been. yeah. I just have to keep it up and. Like you say try to catch it early.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, work on catching it early don't try."
9256.0,Patient,"I mean. Do catch early yeah. yeah see I forget. i've been told my wife, she says well i'll try to do it nope."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
9256.0,Patient,Work on the words been removed from the vocabulary.
252.0,Provider,"And you can always I don't know if you do this but, like put. sticky notes or write it out, you know, do not try do."
9256.0,Patient,"i've written it out on a sticky note and put it in my pocket. Okay, good um so I had to go to a party, two weeks ago. And I was just. Fighting in fighting it. So so i'm I made a list on a sticky note. of things that I can do. To. Like all my copious notes, I wrote them all out. Good so so that way when I got to this reunion party was my wife's high school 40th reunion horrible because I I knew nobody. I when I started kind of getting freaked out pull out that sticky note and read it, and I didn't even have to do any of the things that were on the sticky note, but just knowing that they were there. really helped me get through that night. So so yeah so so that's one thing that definitely helps. In fact, just knowing that I had that list there was enough. Oh. you're frozen Oh, there you go."
252.0,Provider,makes a difference.
9256.0,Patient,"Though it did make a difference. That was one of the coping skills that. Actually. It was a list of coping skills that actually helped without even having to use any of the coping skills, it was just knowing that I had them."
252.0,Provider,In your pocket.
9256.0,Patient,yeah ready to go. So.
252.0,Provider,"So. There you know that there is something called exposure therapy. Right and what and it's something you do, on your own which you have been doing for months and months and months. you've been exposing yourself to these situations that cause you anxiety and panic attacks and that's how we face it, and how we resolve it, it takes practice, it takes time right, but the more that we're willing to do it and feel that uncomfortableness and use. The more they resolve themselves and we quit having them, so you have to remember that it's crazy, because the book that we're doing myself and Mary in our groups is anxiety, you know anxiety and phobias. Is the piece, that we are on you are trying to master. You know master these these. master these skills, and that is a way to resolve them. So just know you're working progress in that area and you're doing amazing."
9256.0,Patient,Okay yeah i'm i'm i'm feeling better. than I have been in the last year. Good so. i'm feeling better than I have been in the last six months. Because I was kind of on the edge there for a while.
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And you yourself have done the work to pull yourself away from that edge remember that. Right, nobody has done that for you. You have done the work yourself."
9256.0,Patient,Well i've had a lot of help.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
9256.0,Patient,or a lot of guidance. But I still did it myself.
252.0,Provider,"Exactly own it because you still do it yourself, we could tell you, you know your psychiatrist myself group we can tell you 100 ways, how to make it better. But unless you take those and you practice those nothing's going to change. Right, but you have taken you know, taking your life taking anxiety taking these things, and you have practice and you're practicing and you're doing it and you're doing it. You know you just have to remember that this is nobody else."
9256.0,Patient,yeah. No one's going to do it for me. And I want change. And I have seen some and even my wife seen some change. In the last six months. of my my attitude. Most of the time it's good change.
252.0,Provider,course definitely you know we are again realizing that we're not going to do things perfectly all the time we're not.
9256.0,Patient,Oh. i've come to that realization.
252.0,Provider,Giving yourself some grace and saying you know what i'm practicing and i'm not always going to do right but that's okay.
9256.0,Patient,so doing.
252.0,Provider,Is that i'm practicing yes. Keeping out of what it should have could is keeping our. stay away from try.
9256.0,Patient,stay with Christ I from what else them from what is the Dakota. i'm. i'm running out of words.
252.0,Provider,You you're running out of words that are anxiety producing. right because you're losing them on. losing them you're saying they don't work for me anymore. Right.
9256.0,Patient,But I am in control so.
252.0,Provider,nurturing control.
9256.0,Patient,"I keep telling myself that and most the time I believe it. Sure, sometimes i'm not a control."
252.0,Provider,"You are, and you know, bringing yourself back into realizing what is it that I do have control over. Oh, I do have control over me."
9256.0,Patient,over me right. i'm I tend to worry about a lot of things that are out of my control.
252.0,Provider,yeah that you gotta let them go you gotta quit worrying about and then realize.
9256.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,There out of your control.
9256.0,Patient,"Especially when my mind starts to race. I mean, I could pick a 50 things that are bothering me that are out of my control yeah even though most of them are probably in my control. Like other people like just dealing with other people and strangers."
252.0,Provider,that's not in your control.
9256.0,Patient,Well it's in my control if I want to deal with them.
252.0,Provider,You have influence. You want to be able to figure out if you want to influence that in the positive or a negative way or not at all.
9256.0,Patient,Not at all.
252.0,Provider,Choices right.
9256.0,Patient,Because i'm in control.
252.0,Provider,Because you're in control of you.
9256.0,Patient,"you're in control of you, I God has. told me. I can't control how other people think."
252.0,Provider,"How they react, how they respond what they do."
9256.0,Patient,"yeah that's something I can't control. Even if they're wrong right, I still would like to control them but and. But then I might be the one that's wrong too, so I don't know."
252.0,Provider,"he's gotta let them have their their control of them to and let them, learn and figure out, you know if they are. True, if they're wrong it's okay."
9256.0,Patient,"That, I have a problem with. Other people being wrong. Not that i'm always right. But I mean little things not turning on your turn single when you turn just drives me nuts. But you know little stupid things that I have no control over. what's wrong with these people. and I. have to. I need to let that go, yes, giving them more power."
252.0,Provider,Yes.
9256.0,Patient,Then I should be.
252.0,Provider,it's wasting you know space you're giving them space it's.
9256.0,Patient,wasting my energy. yeah this is exhausting.
252.0,Provider,"can't control how other people die and I totally understand it, I totally understand why, because it is frustrating. or."
9256.0,Patient,hey yeah I mean it's hard to just watch the news at night.
252.0,Provider,I don't watch the news.
9256.0,Patient,"i'm not saying there's a bunch of Stupid people but. there's a bunch of people that think differently than I do. mm hmm and, for some reason that upsets me. I don't know why."
252.0,Provider,"you're allowed to have your opinion, and you just got to remember everybody's allowed to have their opinion and so you're not going to agree with everybody and."
9256.0,Patient,that's what and exactly but yeah no. I would like everyone to agree with me. But. it's not going to happen.
252.0,Provider,No it's not.
9256.0,Patient,And i'm coming to that realization.
252.0,Provider,"And again, realizing what you have control over what do you have power over. Myself yeah."
9256.0,Patient,"My own thoughts my own actions. For the most part, yes."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, for the most part."
9256.0,Patient,I mean there's certain things I can't control. My heart stops beating. Exactly that's supposed to be my brain that controls that right it's just a little short circuit somewhere yes.
